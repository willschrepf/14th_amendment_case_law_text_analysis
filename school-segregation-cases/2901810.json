Brown, III, and\nprosecution investigator Richard Lee for their roles in the investigation which led to\nhis conviction for murder and sentence to death. The district court3 denied Amrine\nleave to file a third amended complaint and granted summary judgment to defendants\nBrown and Lee on the basis of prosecutorial immunity and to Brooks and Hemeyer\non the basis of qualified immunity. Amrine appeals from the dismissal of his claims\nagainst Brooks and Hemeyer. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern\nDistrict of Iowa, sitting by designation.\n      2\n       Brooks is deceased, and appellee Marilyn Schmutlzer is the personal\nrepresentative of his estate.\n      3\n      The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri.\n                                         -2-\n\f                                           I.\n\n      Amrine was convicted in April 1986 of the murder of fellow inmate Gary\nBarber in the Missouri state penitentiary. Barber was stabbed to death at\napproximately 2:30 p.m. on October 18, 1985 in a multipurpose room, in which he as\nwell as Amrine and 40 to 50 other inmates were spending their recreation period.\nAmrine had learned from inmate Terry Russell the previous week that Barber had\nbeen spreading a rumor about having had sex with Amrine when he was passed out\nfrom drinking alcohol. When Amrine and Russell confronted Barber about the rumor,\nRussell and Barber ended up fighting. Both Barber and Russell were placed in\ndetention cells and not released until 10:00 a.m. on October 18, the day of the killing.\n\n      At the time Barber was stabbed Officer John Noble was guarding a locked door\nwhich was the only entrance in and out of the multipurpose room. Amrine claims that\nRussell was also in the room, but appellees contend that he was not. Around 2:25\np.m. Officer Noble saw Barber chase another inmate from the back of the room to the\nfront near where Noble was standing. Noble saw an \"ice-pick type weapon\" in\nBarber's hand and only realized that Barber had been stabbed when he collapsed near\nhim. Noble retrieved the weapon from the floor, opened the locked door, and called\nfor Sergeant Dobson who was stationed just outside the room. Dobson went in and\nordered an immediate lockdown of the room so that no inmate could either leave or\nenter. Prison guidelines required officers to compile a list of every inmate in a\nlockdown room. The rest of the prison was also locked down.\n\n       Officer Danny Bowers entered the multipurpose room after the lockdown, and\nNoble pointed out Russell as the inmate whom Barber was chasing. Officer Bowers\ntook Russell from the room out into the hall, searched him, and later escorted him to\nan office for questioning. The parties disagree about whether Noble correctly\nidentified the person Barber was chasing. Noble asked the inmate Barber was chasing\nfor his name; he replied \"Russell.\" Brooks and Hemeyer contend, however, that it was\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fAmrine who answered with Russell's name. The two men apparently had similar skin\ntone, physical characteristics, and hairstyle. Officer Noble testified in a 2006\ndeposition that he was certain that the person Barber was chasing was Russell.\n\n       Appellee George Brooks, an investigator for the Missouri Department of\nCorrections, learned of the stabbing almost immediately. He spoke to Officer Noble,\nwho told him that Barber had been chasing Russell, that Barber and Russell had been\nfighting, and that both had just been released from confinement earlier that day.\nOfficers searched the multipurpose room several times while the inmates were still in\nthe room, and no blood or other physical evidence was found except where Barber\ncollapsed. Brooks performed his own search of the room and found nothing. Brooks\nordered that all inmates be searched as they left the room and that the room be\nsearched again afterwards. Officers also searched the area outside the room without\nsuccess.\n\n      Brooks then went to talk with Russell. He stripsearched him, found nothing\nsuspicious, and did not question him about the stabbing. After Brooks received\ninformation from a \"confidential source\" saying that he should investigate Amrine for\nthe murder because there had been talk that morning that he would attack Barber,\nBrooks verified that Amrine was on the list of inmates who had been in the\nmultipurpose room. He then spoke with Captain Hallford, an officer in the supermax\nunit where the incident had occurred, who told him that Amrine \"was the man we\nshould be looking [at].\" Brooks then spoke with Amrine. He stripsearched him and\nobserved a small red spot on his pants and three spots on his undershirt. Brooks took\nAmrine's clothing into custody; the spots appeared to be blood, but they were not fresh\nand were never identified as Barber's blood.\n\n       Deputy John Hemeyer, Cole County Deputy Sheriff, arrived shortly after\nBrooks took Amrine's clothing into custody. Hemeyer was involved in all the\ninterviews and investigation from that point forward. Brooks and Hemeyer began to\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fquestion Amrine at 4:04 p.m. Amrine denied stabbing Barber and said that he had\nnever gotten close to Barber so the spots on his clothing could not be from him. They\nterminated his interview without asking death penalty qualifying questions although\nHemeyer later testified that they had intended to ask them but forgot. Amrine was\nplaced in a detention cell for the investigation of murder.\n\n       Brooks and Hemeyer interviewed Russell at 5:35 p.m. Russell admitted to his\nfight with Barber the previous week. He also said that Amrine had wanted to stab\nBarber to pay him back for spreading rumors about him but could not do it when\nBarber was in isolation. Although Officer Noble had told Brooks that he saw Barber\nchase Russell, the two investigators did not ask Russell any questions about the\nstabbing. At 8:00 p.m. they took a formal statement from him. He admitted to being\nin the multipurpose room at the beginning of the recreation period, but he claimed that\nhe was not inside at the time of the stabbing. He stated that he had asked Noble for\npermission to leave the room to get aspirin and that Noble gave him permission and\nopened the door for him.4 Russell said that he went to the control center where the\nsergeant on duty gave him aspirin in a brown medicine bag and that he had been\ntalking with another inmate named \"Peebles\" at the time Sergeant Dobson yelled for\na stretcher. Russell returned to the multipurpose room, and Noble initially refused\nto let him enter. Russell also claimed that he asked Amrine why he had stabbed\nBarber and that Amrine said, \"I had to do it.\"\n\n       Hemeyer later testified that he had had \"doubts\" about Russell's story at the\ntime, but he and Brooks never located the brown medicine bag which Russell claimed\nto have obtained after Noble let him out of the multipurpose room. They also did not\ntalk to the sergeant who purportedly gave Russell the aspirin, did not identify the\ninmate called \"Peebles,\" and never questioned Officer Noble about the inconsistencies\nbetween his identification of Russell and Russell's claim that he was not in the room\n\n      4\n      Noble verified that he gave Russell permission to leave the room but did not\nremember his actually leaving the room.\n                                          -5-\n\for between Russell's statement that Noble let him back in the room after the lockdown\nand Noble's testimony that he let no one reenter.\n\n      At 10:30 p.m. on October 18 Brooks and Hemeyer began their second interview\nwith Amrine and asked the death penalty qualifying questions overlooked earlier.\nAmrine denied stabbing Barber and said that he had been playing cards with other\ninmates at the time of the attack. After this interview, Amrine was returned to a\ndetention cell and remained in segregated confinement until his trial in April 1986.\n\n       On October 21 Brooks and Hemeyer interviewed inmate Jerry Poe, a\nschizophrenic who told them he feared for his life. Poe said that he believed that his\nlife was threatened because of Barber's killing and that he would only give a statement\nif he were moved to protective custody. Poe gave a statement about the stabbing\nwhich conflicted with other evidence. He was the only witness to testify that someone\nwiped blood off of Barber's face with a towel, and no towel was ever found. Brooks\nand Hemeyer showed Poe pictures of inmates and asked him to identify the person\nchased by Barber. On the day of the stabbing Poe had seen the officers take Amrine\nfrom his cell, and he knew that Amrine was a suspect. When Poe was shown an eight\nyear old picture of Amrine, he stated \"I want to say that he's the one that stabbed\nBarber, but I can't be positive from this picture.\" Brooks asked him to flip over the\npicture where Poe saw Amrine's name, prison number, and the date of the picture.\nWhen asked if he was sure about his identification of Barber's murderer, Poe indicated\nthat he was. After he spoke to Brooks and Hemeyer, he was transferred to the county\njail.\n\n       Russell took a polygraph exam on October 22, 1985. Brooks' final investigative\nreport indicates that Russell's polygraph was truthful, but Russell later testified at an\nevidentiary hearing that the polygraph indicated a conflicted answer as to whether or\nnot he had been in the multipurpose room when the stabbing occurred. This evidence\nwas not presented in the jury trial. The polygraph also showed that Russell gave a\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\ftruthful answer when he denied stabbing Barber. At a later evidentiary hearing\nRussell stated that he had not wanted to testify against Amrine at his murder trial\nbecause he did not know if Amrine had actually stabbed Barber, but that Brooks and\nHemeyer threatened to charge him with the murder if he did not.\n\n       Brooks and Hemeyer also interviewed inmates Dodson, Willis, Jordan, Crume,\nBall, and Hines on October 22, but none of them said they had seen the stabbing.\nWhile inmates Crume and Hines said they had seen Barber chase Amrine, Ball said\nthat Amrine had been playing cards with him when Barber was stabbed, and Jordan\nsaid that Amrine was standing next to him at the poker table at the time.\n\n       Despite the inconsistencies, Brooks and Hemeyer did not do any further\ninvestigation before Brooks submitted his investigative report dated December 2,\n1985. His report concluded that it \"appeared\" that Amrine had stabbed Barber.\nSubsequently on January 24, 1986, Brooks met with inmate Jordan who changed his\nearlier story and now said that Amrine had stabbed Barber and then was chased\naround the room by him. Brooks and prosecution investigator Lee interviewed inmate\nWayne Garrison on April 8, 1986. At first Garrison said that he had not seen the\nstabbing but had seen Barber chasing Amrine; later in the interview he said that he\nsaw Amrine stab Barber. Lee and Brooks interviewed inmate Henry Belk on April 9,\n1986; Belk also stated that Barber had been chasing Amrine. They also interviewed\nRandy Ferguson, who refused to say anything on tape until prosecutor Brown agreed\nto drop a weapon charge against him; he then told Brooks and Lee that Amrine\nstabbed Barber and was the man being chased.\n\n       A jury convicted Amrine of Barber's murder on April 30, 1986, and he was\nsentenced to death on May 1. The state's case rested on the testimony of inmates\nRussell, Poe, and Ferguson. Officer Noble testified that he saw Barber chase Russell\nacross the room, and six inmates testified that Amrine was playing poker with them\nin a different part of the room when the stabbing occurred. Three of those inmates\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fidentified Russell as the person Barber had been chasing. None of the six named\nAmrine. Amrine's conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal, State v.\nAmrine, 741 S.W.2d 665 (Mo. 1987), and he unsuccessfully sought post conviction\nrelief. Amrine v. State, 785 S.W.2d 531 (Mo. 1990). At an evidentiary hearing\nduring post conviction proceedings both Russell and Ferguson had recanted their trial\ntestimony, but Poe did not appear or testify.\n\n       Amrine then filed a federal habeas petition. After the petition was denied by\nthe district court, Amrine obtained new counsel who located Poe and produced an\naffidavit from him. In that affidavit Poe completely recanted his trial testimony and\nswore that he had not seen Amrine stab Barber and that he had falsely identified\nAmrine. After reviewing the voluminous record, we concluded that Amrine had made\na showing of actual innocence. Amrine v. Bowersox, 128 F.3d 1222, 1228 (8th Cir.\n1997) (en banc). We therefore reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing in\nthe federal district court.\n\n      On remand the district court heard testimony from Poe, as well as from Russell,\nFerguson, another inmate named Kevin Dean, and Officer Noble. After finding that\nPoe's testimony was unreliable, the district court again denied the petition. We\naffirmed, based on the district court's credibility findings. Amrine v. Bowersox, 238\nF.3d 1023 (8th Cir. 2001). The Missouri Supreme Court later concluded that there\nwas clear and convincing evidence that Amrine was actually innocent of Barber's\nmurder, granted him habeas relief, and set aside his conviction and sentence. State ex\nrel Amrine v. Roper, 102 S.W.3d 541 (Mo. 2003).\n\n       Amrine filed this § 1983 action in December 2004, alleging violation of\nprocedural due process, conspiracy, and malicious prosecution. After defendants\nmoved for summary judgment and Amrine moved to file a third amended complaint\nasserting a substantive due process claim, the district court denied Amrine's motion\nand granted that of the defendants. It dismissed the claims against Brown and Lee on\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthe basis of prosecutorial immunity and concluded that the actions of Brooks and\nHemeyer were supported by probable cause or at least arguable probable cause and\nthat they were therefore entitled to qualified immunity. Since Amrine had not pled\nsubstantive due process, his reckless investigation claim was dismissed, and the\ndistrict court determined that Brooks and Hemeyer had not violated Amrine's\nprocedural due process rights by bad faith withholding of exculpatory evidence from\nthe prosecutors. Amrine appeals the summary judgment granting Brooks and\nHemeyer qualified immunity on his procedural due process claim, which the district\ncourt had construed to allege a Fourth Amendment violation.5\n\n       Amrine contends on appeal that the only reliable evidence showed that he was\nactually innocent of the stabbing and that the district court erred by granting qualified\nimmunity to Brooks and Hemeyer because they had violated his clearly established\nright not to be arrested without probable cause. Amrine also argues that his due\nprocess claim stated a substantive due process violation even though it was labeled as\n\"procedural\" and that the district court erred by denying him leave to file a third\namended complaint. He asserts that any delay would not have unfairly prejudiced\nappellees and that the amendment would not have been futile.\n\n                                           II.\n\n       We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Skare v. Extendicare\nHealth Services, Inc., 515 F.3d 836, 840 (8th Cir. 2008). Amrine asserts that the\ndistrict court erred by granting qualified immunity to Brooks and Hemeyer on his\nFourth Amendment claim because they arrested him without probable cause. We\nreview the finding of qualified immunity de novo. McClendon v. Story County\nSheriff's Office, 403 F.3d 510, 515 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n      5\n       Amrine does not appeal the dismissal of his conspiracy and malicious\nprosecution claims.\n                                           -9-\n\f       Qualified immunity is a defense available to government officials if they have\nnot violated \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\nreasonable person would have known.\" Young v. Selk, 508 F.3d 868, 871 (8th Cir.\n2007) (citation omitted); see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). It\n\"allows officers to make reasonable errors so that they do not always 'err on the side\nof caution'\" for fear of being sued. Habiger v. City of Fargo, 80 F.3d 289, 295 (8th\nCir.) (citation omitted), cert. denied 519 U.S. 1011 (1996); see Davis v. Scherer, 468\nU.S. 183, 196 (1984). This defense provides \"ample room for mistaken judgments\"\nby protecting \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the\nlaw.\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 343, 341 (1986).\n\n       When considering whether a state official is entitled to qualified immunity, we\nfirst determine whether the alleged facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the\ninjured party, demonstrate that the official's conduct violated a constitutional right.\nSee Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). If the answer to that inquiry is yes, we\nnext ask whether the constitutional right was clearly established at the time so that a\nreasonable officer would have understood that his conduct violated that right. Id. at\n201. Amrine submits that his placement in restrictive confinement by Brooks and\nHemeyer on October 18, 1985 following their Miranda warnings was an arrest\nviolating his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure because\nit was not supported by probable cause.6\n\n      Prison officials may place inmates in segregated confinement without\nimplicating protected liberty interests so long as the confinement does not \"impose[]\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\n\n\n      6\n        Count 1 of Amrine's Second Amended Complaint alleged a procedural due\nprocess claim that he had a protected liberty interest in being free from wrongful\nconviction and incarceration. The district court liberally construed this claim to allege\na violation of Amrine's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free of arrest\nand prosecution without probable cause.\n                                          -10-\n\fprison life.\" Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). Sandin involved\napplication of a state prison regulation rather than an alleged deprivation of a\nfundamental right, however, and we have not had occasion to consider whether\nplacement in a detention cell within a prison on suspicion of commission of a crime\nqualifies as an arrest for the purpose of the Fourth Amendment's probable cause\nrequirement. Cases from other circuits suggest that it does not because segregation\nis used to discipline or investigate inmates for violations of prison regulations, to\nprotect them from the general population, or to provide a cooling off period after\naltercations between inmates. See United States v. Duke, 527 F.2d 386, 390 (5th\nCir.), cert. denied 426 U.S. 952 (1976); see also United States v. Daniels, 698 F.2d\n221, 223 (4th Cir. 1983) (segregated confinement is not an arrest for purposes of\nconstitutional protections ); United States v. Clardy, 540 F.2d 439, 441 (9th Cir.)\n(placement in segregated confinement for five months until indictment not an arrest\nfor speedy trial purposes), cert. denied 429 U.S. 963 (1976). On the other hand, the\nSupreme Court has suggested in dicta that a major change in conditions of\nconfinement, such as solitary isolation, may implicate liberty interests for which\nminimum procedural safeguards are required by due process. See Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 571 n.19 (1974).\n\n      Even assuming that Amrine's detention by Brooks and Hemeyer on October 18,\n1985 was an arrest, we find that it was supported by arguable probable cause. A\nwarrantless arrest is consistent with the Fourth Amendment if it is supported by\nprobable cause. See U.S. Const. amend. IV; United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411\n(1976). Probable cause exists when the totality of the circumstances shows that a\nprudent person would believe that the arrestee has committed a crime. See Illinois v.\nGates, 462 U.S. 213, 238–39 (1983); United States v. Washington, 109 F.3d 459, 465\n(8th Cir. 1997). Exculpatory evidence is therefore relevant to whether an officer has\nprobable cause. Kuehl v. Burtis, 173 F.3d 646, 650 (8th Cir. 1999). Officers are not\nrequired to conduct a \"mini-trial\" before arrest, but probable cause \"does not exist\nwhen a 'minimal further investigation' would have exonerated the suspect.\" Id. at 650\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f(citations omitted). Officers may also be entitled to qualified immunity if they arrest\na suspect under the mistaken belief that they have probable cause to do so, provided\nthat the mistake is objectively reasonable. Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 228–29\n(1991) (per curiam). We have characterized this inquiry as whether the officers had\n\"arguable probable cause.\" See Smithson v. Aldrich, 235 F.3d 1058, 1062 (8th Cir.\n2000).\n\n       On the evening of October 18, 1985, the inculpatory evidence against Amrine\nincluded evidence of a motive to kill Barber, information from a confidential\ninformant saying to look at Amrine for the murder, Russell's statement that Amrine\nhad said he \"had to do it,\" and blood spots on Amrine's clothing. The exculpatory\nevidence included Officer Noble's identification of Russell as the inmate whom Barber\nwas chasing, Amrine's denial of involvement in the murder, and inconsistent evidence\nregarding whether Russell was in the multipurpose room at the time of the murder.\nBrooks and Hemeyer did not have the benefit of later discovered evidence when they\nmade the decision to give Amrine Miranda warnings and separate him from the rest\nof the prison population.7 As probable cause is determined \"at the moment the arrest\nwas made,\" any later developed facts are irrelevant to the probable cause analysis for\nan arrest. United States v. Rivera, 370 F.3d 730, 733 (8th Cir. 2004).\n\n       Amrine argues that these facts are similar to the Kuehl case and that this\nsupports his position that no probable cause existed for his arrest and qualified\nimmunity is not appropriate. See 173 F.3d at 648–49. In Kuehl, an officer\ninvestigating an altercation spoke with the suspect for only twenty seconds, ignored\nphysical evidence that corroborated the suspect's claim that she was the victim of an\nassault not the perpetrator, refused to acknowledge her explanation for why she hit the\n\n\n      7\n       Amrine also cites as exculpatory evidence Russell's inconclusive polygraph\nresponse as to whether he was in the room at the time of the stabbing. Since the\npolygraph was taken on October 21 and Amrine's arrest occurred on October 18, the\npolygraph does not factor into the probable cause analysis for the arrest.\n                                         -12-\n\fother party, ignored an eyewitness account that corroborated her statement, and\nomitted most exculpatory evidence from the police report. See id. at 648. We held\nthere that in the absence of exigent circumstances an officer who unreasonably fails\nto investigate an incident sufficiently before arresting a suspect is not entitled to\nqualified immunity. Id. at 651.\n\n       Kuehl is distinguishable because Amrine was given two opportunities prior to\nhis arrest to present his side of the story, and the physical evidence – the blood stains\n– tended at the outset to inculpate him. The exculpatory statement of an independent\nwitness, Officer Noble, was tempered by inconsistencies surrounding Russell's\nlocation and by incriminating statements made to the investigators about Amrine.\n\n        Considering the circumstances and the evidence known to Brooks and Hemeyer\non the evening of October 18, 1985, we conclude that arguable probable cause existed\nto support separating Amrine from the rest of the prison population and placing him\nin restrictive confinement. See Smithson, 235 F.3d at 1062. It would have taken more\nthan a \"minimal further investigation,\" Kuehl, 173 F.3d at 650, to sort out the\ninconsistencies surrounding Russell's location at the time of the murder, to ascertain\nthe source of the blood spots on Amrine's clothing, and to interview additional\nwitnesses who might have exculpated Amrine. Because Amrine's arrest was\nsupported by arguable probable cause, Brooks and Hemeyer are entitled to the\nprotection of qualified immunity on this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f                                          III.\n\n        Amrine argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him leave\nto file a third amended complaint. After the opposing party has filed a responsive\npleading, Rule 15 states that \"a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing\nparty's written consent or the court's leave. The court should freely give leave when\njustice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). A denial of leave to amend may be\njustified by \"undue delay, bad faith on the part of the moving party, futility of the\namendment or unfair prejudice to the opposing party.\" United States ex rel. Joshi v.\nSt. Luke's Hosp., Inc., 441 F.3d 552, 557 (8th Cir.) (citation omitted), cert. denied 127\nS. Ct. 189 (2006).\n\n       While we review the denial of a motion to file an amended complaint for abuse\nof discretion, Joshi, 441 F.3d at 555, we review the finding of futility de novo. In re\nAcceptance Ins. Cos. Sec. Litig., 423 F.3d 899, 904 (8th Cir. 2005). Because we find\nthat the amendment would have been futile, we need not address whether the delay in\nseeking leave to file the third amended complaint could have resulted in unfair\nprejudice to Brooks and Hemeyer or whether Amrine sought to file a third amended\ncomplaint in bad faith. Amrine argues that the allegations in his third amended\ncomplaint state a cause of action for reckless investigation in violation of his\nsubstantive rather than procedural due process rights.\n\n       We recognized a substantive due process cause of action for reckless\ninvestigation in Wilson v. Lawrence County, Mo., 260 F.3d 946 (8th Cir. 2001),\nwhere we identified the liberty interest at stake as the \"interest in obtaining fair\ncriminal proceedings.\" Id. at 956 n.8, citing Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87\n(1963). The test for whether state officers' actions violate this protected liberty\ninterest is whether those actions shock the conscience. Id. at 956, citing County of\nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998). Mere negligent failure to investigate\ndoes not violate substantive due process. Id. at 955. Likewise, allegations of gross\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fnegligence do not give rise to a constitutional violation. Id. Where state officials\n\"have the opportunity to deliberate various alternatives prior to selecting a course of\nconduct, such action violates due process if it is done recklessly.\" Id. at 956. To\nestablish a violation of this right by a botched investigation, Amrine must show that\nBrooks and Hemeyer intentionally or recklessly failed to investigate, thereby shocking\nthe conscience. See id. at 955–56. As the Wilson court noted, the recklessness\nstandard has a subjective component. Id. at 956 n.9.\n\n        In Wilson, we found that the allegations of a mentally impaired twenty year old,\nthat a confession had been coerced from him by officers investigating a murder, met\nthe recklessness bar if proven at trial, id. at 957, and the motion for summary\njudgment based on qualified immunity was therefore denied. Officers had\ninterviewed Wilson twice, and on both occasions he claimed that he knew nothing\nabout the murder and that he had been shopping with his mother when the murder\noccurred. A sixteen year old, also mentally impaired and known by school officials\nas a\"very skilled liar,\" had told the officers that Wilson confessed the murder to him.\nThey picked up Wilson, read him his rights but told him he was not under arrest,\ndetained him in a windowless interrogation room for hours playing portions of the\nother youth's statement, told him that an eyewitness placed him at the crime scene,\nasked leading questions, threatened him when he gave answers inconsistent with the\ncrime facts, and encouraged him when his answers reflected the details of the murder.\nId. at 950. Eventually Wilson confessed. Id.8\n\n       A similar due process claim was raised in Moran v. Clarke, 296 F.3d 638 (8th\nCir. 2002) (en banc), where a police officer brought a § 1983 case against police\nofficials and the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners after being acquitted of\nbeating a man during a mistaken arrest. He charged that other officers had\nintentionally set up an innocent man, and he produced evidence of \"questionable\n\n      8\n       In 1995 the governor granted Wilson a full pardon after an independent\ninvestigation made it clear that Wilson had not committed the murder.\n                                          -15-\n\fprocedures, of pressures placed on officers to incriminate a specific person or\ncorroborate the department's official line, of a hasty condemnation of [himself] and\nof improper consideration of his race\" in addition to proof that defendants had\n\"purposely ignored\" exculpatory evidence. Id. at 648. We held that Moran could\nestablish a due process violation if a jury were to find his evidence credible.\n\n       Another claim of reckless investigation, also arising in the Missouri state\npenitentiary and also involving investigator George Brooks, was brought in\nClemmons v. Armontrout, 477 F.3d 962 (8th Cir.), cert. denied 128 S. Ct. 155 (2007).\nAfter a prisoner was stabbed to death, Corrections Officer Steigerwald identified\nClemmons as the perpetrator. Although inmate Dwight Clark told Captain Gross that\nanother prisoner named Fred Bagby was involved in the murder, id. at 964, Gross\nnever questioned Bagby or searched his cell. Captain Gross had decided Clark was\nnot a credible witness because Bagby's name was not on a list of prisoners who were\nsaid to be out of their cells at the time of the murder, and he prepared an investigation\nmemorandum for investigator Brooks to that effect. Id. Brooks never interviewed\nClark or Bagby.9 Id. We concluded that the actions of the investigating officers were\nnot intentional or reckless, particularly because Officer Steigerwald's eyewitness\naccount had identified Clemmons as the killer. Id. at 966–67. Clemmons also had not\nproduced any evidence that Brooks consciously sought to suppress exculpatory facts\nor pressured others not to investigate leads. Id. We determined that on these facts a\nreasonable factfinder could not find that Brooks had acted recklessly. Id.\n\n      These three cases dealing with claims of reckless investigation are instructive\nhere. Amrine has produced no evidence suggesting that Brooks and Hemeyer\nattempted to coerce or threaten him as the officers did to the Wilson plaintiff. There\n\n\n      9\n        Clemmons eventually succeeded in winning a new trial after filing a habeas\npetition claiming that exculpatory evidence had been withheld, particularly Clark's\nstatement. Clemmons v. Delo, 124 F.3d 944, 952 (8th Cir. 1997). He was acquitted\nin his retrial. Clemmons, 477 F.3d at 965.\n                                          -16-\n\fis also no evidence that the investigators purposely ignored evidence suggesting that\nAmrine was innocent, as occurred in Wilson and Moran. Neither was there any\nindication of systemic pressure to implicate Amrine in the face of evidence to the\ncontrary as in Moran. The facts alleged by Amrine more closely resemble those in\nClemmons, for Brooks and Hemeyer similarly failed in his case to follow through on\ninvestigating other leads. They did not investigate inconsistencies related to Russell's\nlocation at the time of the murder, such as trying to locate \"Peebles\" or the medication\nRussell claimed to have received. Construed with all reasonable inferences in favor\nof Amrine, their early focus on him and their conduct of the investigation still do not\nrise above negligence. Significant evidence uncovered during the investigation\npointed to Amrine. That trial witnesses later recanted some testimony does not\nestablish that the investigation into Barber's murder was reckless. Amrine, like\nClemmons, offered no evidence that the investigators consciously suppressed\npotentially exculpatory evidence or recklessly pinned the murder on a convenient\nsuspect.10\n\n       Because the facts alleged by Amrine are insufficient to make out a claim of\nreckless investigation by Brooks and Hemeyer, we conclude that the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Amrine leave to file a third amended complaint\nasserting a substantive due process cause of action for reckless investigation. The\namendment would have been futile.\n\n\n\n\n      10\n         Russell later stated that, on the morning he was to testify against Amrine at\ntrial, Brooks and Hemeyer threatened to charge him with the murder if he did not take\nthe stand. Amrine alleges that this proves that Brooks and Hemeyer covered up\nexculpatory evidence. While this conduct was unlawful and reprehensible if true, it\nstill would not establish that the investigation phase of the stabbing was reckless.\n                                          -17-\n\f                                          IV.\n\n       In hindsight it is certainly possible to see imperfections in the investigation of\nBarber's murder and to question the almost immediate placement of Amrine in\ndetention on suspicion of murder, but the volatile circumstances in the prison setting\nand the more than considerable evidence implicating Amrine must be considered.\nAlthough Amrine lived under the judgment of a death sentence for many years,\njudicial proceedings eventually rescued him from that fate. Our en banc court\ndetermined in 1997 that he had made a showing of actual innocence sufficient to\njustify an evidentiary hearing, and the Missouri Supreme Court subsequently\nconcluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that he was actually innocent\nof the murder.\n\n       The issues are different in this § 1983 case, and Brooks and Hemeyer had\narguable probable cause to detain Amrine on the evening of October 18, 1985. They\ndid not violate his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure and\nare therefore entitled to qualified immunity on that claim. We also conclude that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying Amrine leave to file a third\namended complaint because it would have been futile. Accordingly, we affirm the\njudgment of the district court.11\n                         ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        Because of our conclusions, we need not address the contention that Amrine's\nclaims are barred by collateral estoppel.\n                                          -18-\n\f",

Barber was stabbed to death at\napproximately 2:30 p.m. on October 18, 1985 in a multipurpose room, in which he as\nwell as Amrine and 40 to 50 other inmates were spending their recreation period.\nAmrine had learned from inmate Terry Russell the previous week that Barber had\nbeen spreading a rumor about having had sex with Amrine when he was passed out\nfrom drinking alcohol. When Amrine and Russell confronted Barber about the rumor,\nRussell and Barber ended up fighting. Both Barber and Russell were placed in\ndetention cells and not released until 10:00 a.m. on October 18, the day of the killing.\n\n      At the time Barber was stabbed Officer John Noble was guarding a locked door\nwhich was the only entrance in and out of the multipurpose room. Amrine claims that\nRussell was also in the room, but appellees contend that he was not. Around 2:25\np.m. Officer Noble saw Barber chase another inmate from the back of the room to the\nfront near where Noble was standing. Noble saw an \"ice-pick type weapon\" in\nBarber's hand and only realized that Barber had been stabbed when he collapsed near\nhim. Noble retrieved the weapon from the floor, opened the locked door, and called\nfor Sergeant Dobson who was stationed just outside the room. Dobson went in and\nordered an immediate lockdown of the room so that no inmate could either leave or\nenter. Prison guidelines required officers to compile a list of every inmate in a\nlockdown room. The rest of the prison was also locked down.\n\n       Officer Danny Bowers entered the multipurpose room after the lockdown, and\nNoble pointed out Russell as the inmate whom Barber was chasing. Officer Bowers\ntook Russell from the room out into the hall, searched him, and later escorted him to\nan office for questioning. The parties disagree about whether Noble correctly\nidentified the person Barber was chasing. Noble asked the inmate Barber was chasing\nfor his name; he replied \"Russell.\" Brooks and Hemeyer contend, however, that it was\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fAmrine who answered with Russell's name. The two men apparently had similar skin\ntone, physical characteristics, and hairstyle. Officer Noble testified in a 2006\ndeposition that he was certain that the person Barber was chasing was Russell.\n\n       Appellee George Brooks, an investigator for the Missouri Department of\nCorrections, learned of the stabbing almost immediately. He spoke to Officer Noble,\nwho told him that Barber had been chasing Russell, that Barber and Russell had been\nfighting, and that both had just been released from confinement earlier that day.\nOfficers searched the multipurpose room several times while the inmates were still in\nthe room, and no blood or other physical evidence was found except where Barber\ncollapsed. Brooks performed his own search of the room and found nothing. Brooks\nordered that all inmates be searched as they left the room and that the room be\nsearched again afterwards. Officers also searched the area outside the room without\nsuccess.\n\n      Brooks then went to talk with Russell. He stripsearched him, found nothing\nsuspicious, and did not question him about the stabbing. After Brooks received\ninformation from a \"confidential source\" saying that he should investigate Amrine for\nthe murder because there had been talk that morning that he would attack Barber,\nBrooks verified that Amrine was on the list of inmates who had been in the\nmultipurpose room. He then spoke with Captain Hallford, an officer in the supermax\nunit where the incident had occurred, who told him that Amrine \"was the man we\nshould be looking [at].\" Brooks then spoke with Amrine. He stripsearched him and\nobserved a small red spot on his pants and three spots on his undershirt. Brooks took\nAmrine's clothing into custody; the spots appeared to be blood, but they were not fresh\nand were never identified as Barber's blood.\n\n       Deputy John Hemeyer, Cole County Deputy Sheriff, arrived shortly after\nBrooks took Amrine's clothing into custody. Hemeyer was involved in all the\ninterviews and investigation from that point forward. Brooks and Hemeyer began to\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fquestion Amrine at 4:04 p.m. Amrine denied stabbing Barber and said that he had\nnever gotten close to Barber so the spots on his clothing could not be from him. They\nterminated his interview without asking death penalty qualifying questions although\nHemeyer later testified that they had intended to ask them but forgot. Amrine was\nplaced in a detention cell for the investigation of murder.\n\n       Brooks and Hemeyer interviewed Russell at 5:35 p.m. Russell admitted to his\nfight with Barber the previous week. He also said that Amrine had wanted to stab\nBarber to pay him back for spreading rumors about him but could not do it when\nBarber was in isolation. Although Officer Noble had told Brooks that he saw Barber\nchase Russell, the two investigators did not ask Russell any questions about the\nstabbing. At 8:00 p.m. they took a formal statement from him. He admitted to being\nin the multipurpose room at the beginning of the recreation period, but he claimed that\nhe was not inside at the time of the stabbing. He stated that he had asked Noble for\npermission to leave the room to get aspirin and that Noble gave him permission and\nopened the door for him.4 Russell said that he went to the control center where the\nsergeant on duty gave him aspirin in a brown medicine bag and that he had been\ntalking with another inmate named \"Peebles\" at the time Sergeant Dobson yelled for\na stretcher. Russell returned to the multipurpose room, and Noble initially refused\nto let him enter. Russell also claimed that he asked Amrine why he had stabbed\nBarber and that Amrine said, \"I had to do it.\"\n\n       Hemeyer later testified that he had had \"doubts\" about Russell's story at the\ntime, but he and Brooks never located the brown medicine bag which Russell claimed\nto have obtained after Noble let him out of the multipurpose room. They also did not\ntalk to the sergeant who purportedly gave Russell the aspirin, did not identify the\ninmate called \"Peebles,\" and never questioned Officer Noble about the inconsistencies\nbetween his identification of Russell and Russell's claim that he was not in the room\n\n      4\n      Noble verified that he gave Russell permission to leave the room but did not\nremember his actually leaving the room.\n                                          -5-\n\for between Russell's statement that Noble let him back in the room after the lockdown\nand Noble's testimony that he let no one reenter.\n\n      At 10:30 p.m. on October 18 Brooks and Hemeyer began their second interview\nwith Amrine and asked the death penalty qualifying questions overlooked earlier.\nAmrine denied stabbing Barber and said that he had been playing cards with other\ninmates at the time of the attack. After this interview, Amrine was returned to a\ndetention cell and remained in segregated confinement until his trial in April 1986.\n\n       On October 21 Brooks and Hemeyer interviewed inmate Jerry Poe, a\nschizophrenic who told them he feared for his life. Poe said that he believed that his\nlife was threatened because of Barber's killing and that he would only give a statement\nif he were moved to protective custody. Poe gave a statement about the stabbing\nwhich conflicted with other evidence. He was the only witness to testify that someone\nwiped blood off of Barber's face with a towel, and no towel was ever found. Brooks\nand Hemeyer showed Poe pictures of inmates and asked him to identify the person\nchased by Barber. On the day of the stabbing Poe had seen the officers take Amrine\nfrom his cell, and he knew that Amrine was a suspect. When Poe was shown an eight\nyear old picture of Amrine, he stated \"I want to say that he's the one that stabbed\nBarber, but I can't be positive from this picture.\" Brooks asked him to flip over the\npicture where Poe saw Amrine's name, prison number, and the date of the picture.\nWhen asked if he was sure about his identification of Barber's murderer, Poe indicated\nthat he was. After he spoke to Brooks and Hemeyer, he was transferred to the county\njail.\n\n       Russell took a polygraph exam on October 22, 1985. Brooks' final investigative\nreport indicates that Russell's polygraph was truthful, but Russell later testified at an\nevidentiary hearing that the polygraph indicated a conflicted answer as to whether or\nnot he had been in the multipurpose room when the stabbing occurred. This evidence\nwas not presented in the jury trial. The polygraph also showed that Russell gave a\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\ftruthful answer when he denied stabbing Barber. At a later evidentiary hearing\nRussell stated that he had not wanted to testify against Amrine at his murder trial\nbecause he did not know if Amrine had actually stabbed Barber, but that Brooks and\nHemeyer threatened to charge him with the murder if he did not.\n\n       Brooks and Hemeyer also interviewed inmates Dodson, Willis, Jordan, Crume,\nBall, and Hines on October 22, but none of them said they had seen the stabbing.\nWhile inmates Crume and Hines said they had seen Barber chase Amrine, Ball said\nthat Amrine had been playing cards with him when Barber was stabbed, and Jordan\nsaid that Amrine was standing next to him at the poker table at the time.\n\n       Despite the inconsistencies, Brooks and Hemeyer did not do any further\ninvestigation before Brooks submitted his investigative report dated December 2,\n1985. His report concluded that it \"appeared\" that Amrine had stabbed Barber.\nSubsequently on January 24, 1986, Brooks met with inmate Jordan who changed his\nearlier story and now said that Amrine had stabbed Barber and then was chased\naround the room by him. Brooks and prosecution investigator Lee interviewed inmate\nWayne Garrison on April 8, 1986. At first Garrison said that he had not seen the\nstabbing but had seen Barber chasing Amrine; later in the interview he said that he\nsaw Amrine stab Barber. Lee and Brooks interviewed inmate Henry Belk on April 9,\n1986; Belk also stated that Barber had been chasing Amrine. They also interviewed\nRandy Ferguson, who refused to say anything on tape until prosecutor Brown agreed\nto drop a weapon charge against him; he then told Brooks and Lee that Amrine\nstabbed Barber and was the man being chased.\n\n       A jury convicted Amrine of Barber's murder on April 30, 1986, and he was\nsentenced to death on May 1. The state's case rested on the testimony of inmates\nRussell, Poe, and Ferguson. Officer Noble testified that he saw Barber chase Russell\nacross the room, and six inmates testified that Amrine was playing poker with them\nin a different part of the room when the stabbing occurred. Three of those inmates\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fidentified Russell as the person Barber had been chasing. None of the six named\nAmrine.

At an evidentiary hearing\nduring post conviction proceedings both Russell and Ferguson had recanted their trial\ntestimony, but Poe did not appear or testify.\n\n       Amrine then filed a federal habeas petition. After the petition was denied by\nthe district court, Amrine obtained new counsel who located Poe and produced an\naffidavit from him. In that affidavit Poe completely recanted his trial testimony and\nswore that he had not seen Amrine stab Barber and that he had falsely identified\nAmrine.

After defendants\nmoved for summary judgment and Amrine moved to file a third amended complaint\nasserting a substantive due process claim, the district court denied Amrine's motion\nand granted that of the defendants. It dismissed the claims against Brown and Lee on\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthe basis of prosecutorial immunity and concluded that the actions of Brooks and\nHemeyer were supported by probable cause or at least arguable probable cause and\nthat they were therefore entitled to qualified immunity. Since Amrine had not pled\nsubstantive due process, his reckless investigation claim was dismissed, and the\ndistrict court determined that Brooks and Hemeyer had not violated Amrine's\nprocedural due process rights by bad faith withholding of exculpatory evidence from\nthe prosecutors. Amrine appeals the summary judgment granting Brooks and\nHemeyer qualified immunity on his procedural due process claim, which the district\ncourt had construed to allege a Fourth Amendment violation.5\n\n       Amrine contends on appeal that the only reliable evidence showed that he was\nactually innocent of the stabbing and that the district court erred by granting qualified\nimmunity to Brooks and Hemeyer because they had violated his clearly established\nright not to be arrested without probable cause. Amrine also argues that his due\nprocess claim stated a substantive due process violation even though it was labeled as\n\"procedural\" and that the district court erred by denying him leave to file a third\namended complaint. He asserts that any delay would not have unfairly prejudiced\nappellees and that the amendment would not have been futile.\n\n                                           II.\n\n       We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

Sandin involved\napplication of a state prison regulation rather than an alleged deprivation of a\nfundamental right, however, and we have not had occasion to consider whether\nplacement in a detention cell within a prison on suspicion of commission of a crime\nqualifies as an arrest for the purpose of the Fourth Amendment's probable cause\nrequirement. Cases from other circuits suggest that it does not because segregation\nis used to discipline or investigate inmates for violations of prison regulations, to\nprotect them from the general population, or to provide a cooling off period after\naltercations between inmates.

The exculpatory\nevidence included Officer Noble's identification of Russell as the inmate whom Barber\nwas chasing, Amrine's denial of involvement in the murder, and inconsistent evidence\nregarding whether Russell was in the multipurpose room at the time of the murder.\nBrooks and Hemeyer did not have the benefit of later discovered evidence when they\nmade the decision to give Amrine Miranda warnings and separate him from the rest\nof the prison population.7 As probable cause is determined \"at the moment the arrest\nwas made,\" any later developed facts are irrelevant to the probable cause analysis for\nan arrest.

See 173 F.3d at 648–49.

Since the\npolygraph was taken on October 21 and Amrine's arrest occurred on October 18, the\npolygraph does not factor into the probable cause analysis for the arrest.\n                                         -12-\n\fother party, ignored an eyewitness account that corroborated her statement, and\nomitted most exculpatory evidence from the police report. See id. at 648. We held\nthere that in the absence of exigent circumstances an officer who unreasonably fails\nto investigate an incident sufficiently before arresting a suspect is not entitled to\nqualified immunity. Id. at 651.\n\n       Kuehl is distinguishable because Amrine was given two opportunities prior to\nhis arrest to present his side of the story, and the physical evidence – the blood stains\n– tended at the outset to inculpate him. The exculpatory statement of an independent\nwitness, Officer Noble, was tempered by inconsistencies surrounding Russell's\nlocation and by incriminating statements made to the investigators about Amrine.\n\n        Considering the circumstances and the evidence known to Brooks and Hemeyer\non the evening of October 18, 1985, we conclude that arguable probable cause existed\nto support separating Amrine from the rest of the prison population and placing him\nin restrictive confinement. See Smithson, 235 F.3d at 1062. It would have taken more\nthan a \"minimal further investigation,\" Kuehl, 173 F.3d at 650, to sort out the\ninconsistencies surrounding Russell's location at the time of the murder, to ascertain\nthe source of the blood spots on Amrine's clothing, and to interview additional\nwitnesses who might have exculpated Amrine. Because Amrine's arrest was\nsupported by arguable probable cause, Brooks and Hemeyer are entitled to the\nprotection of qualified immunity on this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f                                          III.\n\n        Amrine argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him leave\nto file a third amended complaint. After the opposing party has filed a responsive\npleading, Rule 15 states that \"a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing\nparty's written consent or the court's leave. The court should freely give leave when\njustice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).

Id. at 956 n.9.\n\n        In Wilson, we found that the allegations of a mentally impaired twenty year old,\nthat a confession had been coerced from him by officers investigating a murder, met\nthe recklessness bar if proven at trial, id. at 957, and the motion for summary\njudgment based on qualified immunity was therefore denied. Officers had\ninterviewed Wilson twice, and on both occasions he claimed that he knew nothing\nabout the murder and that he had been shopping with his mother when the murder\noccurred. A sixteen year old, also mentally impaired and known by school officials\nas a\"very skilled liar,\" had told the officers that Wilson confessed the murder to him.\nThey picked up Wilson, read him his rights but told him he was not under arrest,\ndetained him in a windowless interrogation room for hours playing portions of the\nother youth's statement, told him that an eyewitness placed him at the crime scene,\nasked leading questions, threatened him when he gave answers inconsistent with the\ncrime facts, and encouraged him when his answers reflected the details of the murder.\nId. at 950. Eventually Wilson confessed. Id.8\n\n       A similar due process claim was raised in Moran v. Clarke, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th\nCir. 2002) (en banc), where a police officer brought a § 1983 case against police\nofficials and the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners after being acquitted of\nbeating a man during a mistaken arrest. He charged that other officers had\nintentionally set up an innocent man, and he produced evidence of \"questionable\n\n      8\n       In 1995 the governor granted Wilson a full pardon after an independent\ninvestigation made it clear that Wilson had not committed the murder.\n                                          -15-\n\fprocedures, of pressures placed on officers to incriminate a specific person or\ncorroborate the department's official line, of a hasty condemnation of [himself] and\nof improper consideration of his race\" in addition to proof that defendants had\n\"purposely ignored\" exculpatory evidence. Id. at 648. We held that Moran could\nestablish a due process violation if a jury were to find his evidence credible.\n\n       Another claim of reckless investigation, also arising in the Missouri state\npenitentiary and also involving investigator George Brooks, was brought in\nClemmons v. Armontrout, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796913\"><a href=\"/opinion/796913/eric-clemmons-appelleecross-appellant-v-william-armontrout-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.), cert. denied </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007).\nAfter a prisoner was stabbed to death, Corrections Officer Steigerwald identified\nClemmons as the perpetrator. Although inmate Dwight Clark told Captain Gross that\nanother prisoner named Fred Bagby was involved in the murder, id. at 964, Gross\nnever questioned Bagby or searched his cell. Captain Gross had decided Clark was\nnot a credible witness because Bagby's name was not on a list of prisoners who were\nsaid to be out of their cells at the time of the murder, and he prepared an investigation\nmemorandum for investigator Brooks to that effect. Id. Brooks never interviewed\nClark or Bagby.9 Id. We concluded that the actions of the investigating officers were\nnot intentional or reckless, particularly because Officer Steigerwald's eyewitness\naccount had identified Clemmons as the killer. Id. at 966–67. Clemmons also had not\nproduced any evidence that Brooks consciously sought to suppress exculpatory facts\nor pressured others not to investigate leads. Id. We determined that on these facts a\nreasonable factfinder could not find that Brooks had acted recklessly. Id.\n\n      These three cases dealing with claims of reckless investigation are instructive\nhere. Amrine has produced no evidence suggesting that Brooks and Hemeyer\nattempted to coerce or threaten him as the officers did to the Wilson plaintiff. There\n\n\n      9\n        Clemmons eventually succeeded in winning a new trial after filing a habeas\npetition claiming that exculpatory evidence had been withheld, particularly Clark's\nstatement. Clemmons v. Delo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746269\"><a href=\"/opinion/746269/eric-clemmons-v-paul-delo/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 952 (8th Cir. 1997). He was acquitted\nin his retrial. Clemmons, 477 F.3d at 965.\n                                          -16-\n\fis also no evidence that the investigators purposely ignored evidence suggesting that\nAmrine was innocent, as occurred in Wilson and Moran. Neither was there any\nindication of systemic pressure to implicate Amrine in the face of evidence to the\ncontrary as in Moran. The facts alleged by Amrine more closely resemble those in\nClemmons, for Brooks and Hemeyer similarly failed in his case to follow through on\ninvestigating other leads. They did not investigate inconsistencies related to Russell's\nlocation at the time of the murder, such as trying to locate \"Peebles\" or the medication\nRussell claimed to have received. Construed with all reasonable inferences in favor\nof Amrine, their early focus on him and their conduct of the investigation still do not\nrise above negligence. Significant evidence uncovered during the investigation\npointed to Amrine. That trial witnesses later recanted some testimony does not\nestablish that the investigation into Barber's murder was reckless. Amrine, like\nClemmons, offered no evidence that the investigators consciously suppressed\npotentially exculpatory evidence or recklessly pinned the murder on a convenient\nsuspect.10\n\n       Because the facts alleged by Amrine are insufficient to make out a claim of\nreckless investigation by Brooks and Hemeyer, we conclude that the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Amrine leave to file a third amended complaint\nasserting a substantive due process cause of action for reckless investigation. The\namendment would have been futile.\n\n\n\n\n      10\n         Russell later stated that, on the morning he was to testify against Amrine at\ntrial, Brooks and Hemeyer threatened to charge him with the murder if he did not take\nthe stand. Amrine alleges that this proves that Brooks and Hemeyer covered up\nexculpatory evidence. While this conduct was unlawful and reprehensible if true, it\nstill would not establish that the investigation phase of the stabbing was reckless.\n                                          -17-\n\f                                          IV.\n\n       In hindsight it is certainly possible to see imperfections in the investigation of\nBarber's murder and to question the almost immediate placement of Amrine in\ndetention on suspicion of murder, but the volatile circumstances in the prison setting\nand the more than considerable evidence implicating Amrine must be considered.\nAlthough Amrine lived under the judgment of a death sentence for many years,\njudicial proceedings eventually rescued him from that fate. Our en banc court\ndetermined in 1997 that he had made a showing of actual innocence sufficient to\njustify an evidentiary hearing, and the Missouri Supreme Court subsequently\nconcluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that he was actually innocent\nof the murder.\n\n       The issues are different in this § 1983 case, and Brooks and Hemeyer had\narguable probable cause to detain Amrine on the evening of October 18, 1985. They\ndid not violate his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure and\nare therefore entitled to qualified immunity on that claim. We also conclude that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying Amrine leave to file a third\namended complaint because it would have been futile. Accordingly, we affirm the\njudgment of the district court.11\n                         ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        Because of our conclusions, we need not address the contention that Amrine's\nclaims are barred by collateral estoppel.\n                                          -18-\n\f</pre>",
