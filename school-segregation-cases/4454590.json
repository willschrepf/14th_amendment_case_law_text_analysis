............................................................................................................ viii \nStatement Regarding Oral Argument .................................................................................... ix \nIssues Presented......................................................................................................................... x \nStatement of Facts ..................................................................................................................... 1 \n           A.         The parties enter into a highly negotiated and agreed temporary\n                      injunction. ........................................................................................................... 1 \n           B.         For months, DeLitta acknowledges the binding force of the agreed\n                      injunction and even seeks enforcement of its terms. ................................... 1 \n           C.         DeLitta retains new counsel who attempts to declare the agreed\n                      injunction void.................................................................................................... 3 \n           D.         When the trial court enforces the Agreed Order as both an\n                      injunction and a Rule 11 agreement, DeLitta seeks review from this\n                      Court, without success. ..................................................................................... 4 \n           E.         Undeterred, DeLitta tries to take another bite at the apple in the\n                      trial court. ............................................................................................................ 5 \nSummary of Argument ............................................................................................................. 6 \nArgument .................................................................................................................................... 7 \n\nI.         On appeal from a denial of a motion to dissolve, an appellate court has\n           no jurisdiction to review the validity of the original temporary injunction. ......... 7 \n\nII.        Litigants should be able to dispense with the formal requirements of Rule\n           683 and enter into an agreed temporary injunction without fear that one\n           party to the agreed order will later attempt to declare the order void................. 10 \n           A.         Neither this Court nor the Texas Supreme Court has held an agreed\n                      injunction void for failure to strictly comply with Rule 683, yet\n                      other appellate courts are split on the issue. ................................................ 11 \n\n\n                                                                       ii\n\f          B.         The cases DeLitta cites are distinguishable. ................................................. 15 \n          C.         Cases that appear to prohibit agreed temporary injunctions\n                     misconstrue Texas Supreme Court precedent and are not soundly\n                     reasoned............................................................................................................. 17 \n          D.         DeLitta is estopped from now challenging the Agreed Order\n                     because he agreed to its issuance and has himself sought to enforce\n                     it. ......................................................................................................................... 22 \n\nIII.      The trial court was within its discretion to deny DeLitta’s motion because\n          the Agreed Order is enforceable as a Rule 11 Agreement. ................................... 24 \n          A.         The Texas Supreme Court allows enforcement of litigation-related\n                     agreements under Rule 11 even when the agreement might not\n                     otherwise be enforceable as an agreed judgment. ....................................... 25 \n          B.         The Agreed Order meets all the elements of an enforceable Rule\n                     11.

His tactics resulted in\n                              several appellate proceedings, all of which failed.3\n\n                              Undeterred, on October 22, 2014, DeLitta made yet another\n                              attempt to renege, this time by filing a Motion to Dissolve\n                              and Declare Temporary Injunction Void.4\n\nTrial Court:                  The Honorable Amy Meachum, 201st District Court, Travis\n                              County, Texas.\n\nTrial Court Disposition:      The trial court signed an order denying DeLitta’s motion on\n                              January 16, 2015.5 The order does not state the reasons for\n                              its issuance.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Appellants in this appeal are Michael J. DeLitta and DelCom Properties, LLC only and will be\nreferred to in this brief as simply “DeLitta.”\n2\n  Exh. A to Brief of Appellant; see also CR115–23\n3\n  See No. 03-14-00423-CV (original proceeding seeking to declare injunction void, denied on July 11,\n2014); No. 03-14-00426-CV (appeal of an order enforcing the terms of the injunction dismissed for\nlack of jurisdiction on November 6, 2014). DeLitta also appealed an order appointing a receiver over\nAxiom, No. 03-13-000425-CV, which was dismissed for failure to prosecute on October 17, 2014.\n4\n  CR329–48\n5\n  CR379–81\n\n\n                                                viii\n\f                    STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n      Appellee does not believe oral argument is necessary for the Court to fully\n\nunderstand and properly resolve this appeal. This is an interlocutory appeal from an\n\norder denying Appellants’ Motion to Dissolve and Declare Temporary Injunction Void.\n\nThe relevant facts are undisputed, and the law is not difficult to grasp. However, to the\n\nextent that the Court has remaining questions after reviewing the briefing, Appellee\n\nwould gladly participate in any oral argument to answer those questions.\n\n\n\n\n                                           ix\n\f                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\n1. Does this Court have jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order signed in October\n2013—over 15 months before this appeal was perfected—when the sole complaint on\nappeal concerns the validity of the original injunction, not a trial court’s failure to\ndissolve based on changed circumstances?\n\n2. The parties negotiated an agreed temporary injunction to govern their conduct\nthrough trial, signed the temporary injunction with the notation “agreed as to form and\nsubstance,” and submitted it to the judge for approval.\n\n   a. Does omitting the reasons for issuance make an agreed temporary injunction\n      void when all the parties understand that the injunction was issued because it was\n      agreed?\n\n   b. Does a subsequent agreed continuance of the trial date stated in the injunction\n      make an injunction retroactively void?\n\n   c. Does a party waive the right to challenge a temporary injunction for failing to\n      comply with Rule 683 by agreeing to the injunction in the first instance, by not\n      appealing it, and/or by themselves seeking to enforce it?\n\n3.    May a trial court refuse to dissolve an agreed temporary injunction because the\nagreed order meets all the requirement of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and is thus\nenforceable in contract?\n\n\n\n\n                                           x\n\f                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n      This is a business dispute over the ownership of Axiom Medical Consulting,\n\nLLC.6 Schaefer and DeLitta are two managers and members of Axiom who each\n\ncontrol 50% of the company.7 The relationship between the two deteriorated and, in\n\nOctober 2013, Schaefer filed suit seeking to confirm her ownership in Axiom and, to\n\nmaintain her status quo within the company, obtained a temporary restraining order.8\n\nA.    The parties enter into a highly negotiated and agreed temporary\n      injunction.\n      Before the restraining order dissolved, the parties requested the trial court\n\napprove a highly negotiated consent order and agreement which was entitled a\n\n“temporary injunction” (the “Agreed Order”).9 The Agreed Order was signed on\n\nOctober 29, 2013.10 It prohibited the parties from undertaking certain acts and also\n\nobligated the parties to file a joint motion for appointment of a provisional member to\n\nbreak deadlock between Schaefer and DeLitta.11\n\nB.    For months, DeLitta acknowledges the binding force of the agreed\n      injunction and even seeks enforcement of its terms.\n      The parties proceeded for over eight months in this litigation under the terms of\n\nthe Agreed Order and in full acknowledgement of its binding force. For example,\n\nmonths after its issuance, on March 13, 2014, DeLitta filed a motion titled “Motion to\n\n6\n  CR134–36\n7\n  CR132\n8\n  CR3\n9\n  CR115\n10\n   CR121\n11\n   CR122\n\n                                          1\n\fEnforce, Modify and/or Dissolve Certain Provisions of the Temporary Injunction.”12\n\nAs the title implies, the motion sought to enforce certain provisions of the injunction.\n\nThe motion was heard, along with a competing enforcement motion by Schaefer,13 on\n\nApril 14, 2014—after the April 7, 2014 trial date set in the Agreed Order.14 Ultimately,\n\nDeLitta’s motion was denied and Schaefer’s motion granted.15 The order was signed\n\nApril 21, 2014.16\n\n       Around the same time, DeLitta filed a “Joint Application for TRO and Motion\n\nto Rescind the Order Appointing a Provisional Member.”17 The motion sought to limit\n\nthe powers of the provisional member who was appointed and selected under the terms\n\nof the Agreed Order. By filing this motion, DeLitta again acknowledged the binding\n\nforce of the Agreed Order. The application and motion were denied.18\n\n       No interlocutory appeals were taken from any of these orders. DeLitta never\n\nchallenged the validity of the injunction or sought to declare the injunction void through\n\nthese motions. DeLitta likewise never appealed the trial court’s orders denying their\n\nrequest to alter or dissolve portions of the original injunction.\n\n\n\n\n12\n   See SuppCR21\n13\n   SuppCR100\n14\n   Compare SuppCR121 (noting date of hearing) and CR121 (Agreed Order setting trial date)\n15\n   SuppCR121–23\n16\n   SuppCR123\n17\n   SuppRR60–70\n18\n   SuppCR120\n\n                                               2\n\fC.      DeLitta retains new counsel who attempts to declare the agreed injunction\n        void.\n        The dispute between Schaefer and DeLitta continued to escalate through the\n\nSpring of 2014. Despite repeated judicial refusal to modify or dissolve the terms of the\n\ninjunction, DeLitta still snubbed the agreed terms. Schaefer filed a second motion to\n\nenforce on May 16, 2014, this time seeking the appointment of a receiver over certain\n\naspects of the company’s financial operations, as well as enforcement of the Agreed\n\nOrder.19\n\n        Shortly before the day of the hearing on Schaefer’s motion, new counsel\n\nappeared20 and, the day of the hearing, filed a written response in opposition to the\n\nmotion to enforce and motion for contempt.21 The response argued (for the first time)\n\nthat the original injunction was “void,” “expired as a matter of law,” and thus could not\n\nform the basis of a contempt order.22 The response contained no allegation of changed\n\ncircumstances that would justify re-litigation of issues.23\n\n        Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court signed an order enforcing the\n\nAgreed Order on June 19, 2014.24 The order expressly found it was being enforced, not\n\njust as a temporary injunction, but also as a Rule 11 agreement.25 The court found that\n\n19\n   SuppCR124\n20\n   CR641\n21\n   SuppRR37\n22\n   Id.\n23\n   SuppRR37–47\n24\n   SuppCR191–93\n25\n   SuppCR192 (finding that the Agreed Order “is an agreed order approved as to ‘form and content’\nby all parties, signed by the court and filed in the clerk’s office” and “is enforceable as a court order\nand as a Rule 11 agreement between the parties”)\n\n                                                   3\n\fDeLitta had willfully violated the Agreed Order through several specifically enumerated\n\nacts.26    Further, although it “had the authority to enforce the Agreed order by\n\ncontempt,” it “declin[ed] to do so.”27 The trial court reiterated, however, that “all parties\n\n[shall] strictly abide by the terms of the” Agreed Order.28 The Court also, by separate\n\norder, appointed a partial receiver over Axiom.29\n\nD.        When the trial court enforces the Agreed Order as both an injunction and\n          a Rule 11 agreement, DeLitta seeks review from this Court, without\n          success.\n          Three appeals followed. DeLitta filed two interlocutory appeals: one appeal of\n\nthe June 19, 2014 enforcement order30 and one appeal of the order appointing the\n\nreceiver.31 DeLitta also filed a petition for writ of mandamus, seeking to vacate the\n\nOctober 2013 agreed temporary injunction.32\n\n          None of the appeals were successful. The Court denied the mandamus petition33\n\nand dismissed the interlocutory appeal of the enforcement order for want of\n\njurisdiction.34 DeLitta abandoned the receivership appeal.35\n\n\n\n\n26\n   Id.\n27\n   Id.\n28\n   Id.

Undeterred, DeLitta tries to take another bite at the apple in the trial court.\n       Three appellate losses did not deter DeLitta. By December, he was back before\n\nanother Travis County district judge seeking to dissolve the Agreed Order.36 Essentially\n\ncutting and pasting from his failed briefing to this Court, DeLitta argued that the Agreed\n\nOrder was void because it did not comply with the mandatory requirements of Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure 683 and 684.37 DeLitta’s motion was silent to the fact that the\n\nAgreed Order had already been determined to be an enforceable Rule 11 agreement.38\n\nNor did the motion contain any allegations of changed circumstances that would justify\n\nre-litigation of the various issues.39\n\n       The trial court denied DeLitta’s motion on January 16, 2015, without stating the\n\nreasons.40 This appeal followed.41\n\n\n\n\n36\n   See RR (transcript of Dec. 15, 2014, hearing on DeLitta’s Motion to Dissolve and Declare Temporary\nInjunction Void, which was filed on Oct. 22, 2014).\n37\n   CR329–37\n38\n   See generally id.\n39\n   SuppRR37–47\n40\n   CR379\n41\n   CR632\n\n                                                 5\n\f                               SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n      DeLitta voluntarily agreed to restraints on his conduct, by signing a highly\n\nnegotiated Agreed Temporary Injunction under the notation “agreed as to form and\n\ncontent,” while Schaefer pursued her claims concerning the ownership of Axiom. He\n\nsought the benefit of the Agreed Order, when it behooved him to do so, by twice\n\nmoving to enforce the terms of the order. Yet he has spent the majority of the last year\n\nhoping desperately that the judiciary will allow him to renege on his promise. No judge\n\nhas let him off the hook yet. Nor should this Court.\n\n      DeLitta’s main argument is that the Agreed Order is void for failing to state the\n\nreasons for its issuance, a requirement for court-imposed temporary injunctions under\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 683. This argument makes no sense. A party should not\n\nbe able to “void” an order for failing to state the reason for its issuance when the reason\n\nthe trial court entered the order was because the parties asked it to.\n\n      DeLitta insists the Agreed Order is void because, otherwise, he loses under a\n\nmyriad of equitable principles. His consent to the order removed any alleged error in\n\nit. He has twice pursued the benefits of the injunctive terms, so he is estopped from\n\nchallenging the order now. And he waited too long to appeal.\n\n      But the Court need not reach any of these issues. The trial court previously\n\nenforced the Agreed Order as a Rule 11 Agreement.               Rule 11 agreements are\n\nenforceable in contract even if they would not be enforceable as a judgment. The trial\n\ncourt’s refusal to dissolve the Agreed Order may be affirmed on this ground alone.\n\n\n                                            6\n\f                                       ARGUMENT\nI.    On appeal from a denial of a motion to dissolve, an appellate court has no\n      jurisdiction to review the validity of the original temporary injunction.\n      The Court should dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nAppellate courts consider their interlocutory jurisdiction “narrow” and thus “strictly\n\napply statutes granting interlocutory appeals.” CMH Homes v. Perez, 340 S.W.3d 444,\n\n447 (Tex. 2011); see also Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. City of Sunset Valley, 8 S.W.3d 727, 730\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1999, no pet.).\n\n       Here, DeLitta seeks review of an agreed injunction issued October 23, 2013—\n\nwell over a year before this appeal was perfected on February 4, 2015. Unlike most\n\ninterlocutory appeals of an order refusing to dissolve a temporary injunction, DeLitta\n\ndid not allege changed circumstances that warrant the injunction’s dissolution.\n\nTherefore, DeLitta does not seek review of the exercise of discretion to dissolve an\n\ninjunction. Instead, DeLitta seeks review of the original injunction itself. This Court\n\nsimply has no jurisdiction to review that order.\n\n       The Court decided the issue just over 30 years ago in Tober v. Turner of Texas, Inc.,\n\n668 S.W.2d 831 (Tex. App.—Austin 1984, no writ). The trial court in Tober signed a\n\ntemporary injunction on October 11, 1982. Id. at 833. The following month, on\n\nNovember 16, 1982, and after the time for filing an interlocutory appeal for immediate\n\nreview of the injunction, Tober (the party restrained) sought to “set aside” the\n\ntemporary injunction. Id. Soon thereafter, on December 1, 1982, the trial court signed\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fan order overruling Tober’s motion (apparently treating it as a motion to dissolve the\n\ntemporary injunction). Id.\n\n      Tober appealed, purporting to challenge both the December 1 order and the\n\noriginal November 16 injunction. Id. This Court, construing its jurisdiction narrowly,\n\nrebuffed Tober’s tactic. The Court started by noting that Tober did not timely perfect\n\nan appeal from the original injunction and, as such, the Court had no jurisdiction to\n\nreview it. Id. at 833–34. The Court also refused to consider any issues that touched on\n\nthe propriety of the initial grant of the injunction. Id. at 834. Doing so, it reasoned,\n\nwould allow a party to circumvent Section 51.014:\n\n      If a litigant is permitted, upon motion to dissolve, to again challenge the\n      original temporary injunction grant, without an allegation of changed\n      conditions, then the litigant could accomplish indirectly what he could not\n      directly do . . . thereby render meaningless the appellate timetable\n      applicable to accelerated appeals. . . . [A] litigant, after unsuccessfully\n      opposing a temporary injunction, could wait for an indefinite period to\n      perfect an appeal of the grant of the temporary injunction (by filing a\n      subsequent motion to dissolve, which raises the points of error which\n      could have, and should have, been raised in a direct appeal of the order\n      granting temporary injunction).\n\nId. at 835. The Court was adamant: “[a] motion to dissolve may not be used as a means\n\nof evading or expanding the rules applicable to appealing interlocutory orders.” Id.\n\nThus, unless a temporary injunction order is timely appealed, appellate courts “must\n\npresume the trial court’s initial decision to grant the temporary injunction was proper.”\n\nMurphy v. McDaniel, 20 S.W.3d 873, 879 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2000, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f        The Tober Court does not convey a single justification for its ruling; it teeters\n\nbetween viewing the issue an equitable one and a jurisdictional one.42 But other\n\ndecisions make clear the issue is one of jurisdiction:\n\n         “[W]here the time to review the order granting the temporary injunction has\n        expired . . . [w]e do not have jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the trial\n        court’s decision to grant the temporary injunction.” Murphy v. McDaniel, 20\n        S.W.3d at 879.\n         “An interlocutory order that is not timely appealed is not reviewable by this\n        Court. . . . [Appellants’] failure to perfect an interlocutory appeal from [the\n        temporary injunction] order precludes this Court from reviewing its validity.”\n        State v. Ruiz Wholesale Co., 901 S.W.2d 772, 775 (Tex. App.—Austin 1995, no\n        writ).\n         “[A]ppellees did not perfect an appeal from the initial order, and the time limit\n        for doing so has long since expired. Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to\n        review the validity of the trial court’s . . . order granting the temporary\n        injunction.” Desai v. Reliance Mach. Works, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex. App.—\n        Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ).43\n\n\n42\n   Compare 668 S.W.2d at 834 (“By failing to perfect an appeal from the grant of the temporary\ninjunction, Tober has now, upon appeal of the motion to dissolve, waived the right to complain of\nthe specified alleged errors.”) with id. at 835 (“A motion to dissolve may not be used as a means of\nevading or expanding the rules applicable to appealing interlocutory orders. A statute authorizing an\nappeal from an interlocutory order must be given a strict construction since the statute is in derogation\nof the general rule that only final judgments and orders are appealable.”); see also id. at 836 (“[O]ur\nholding does not here turn solely upon jurisdiction, but is also grounded upon Tober’s failure to prove\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in overruling the motion to dissolve.”).\n43\n   See also In re Graybar Elec. Co., No. 13-08-00341-CV (consolidated), 2008 WL 3970865, *13 (Tex.\nApp.—Corpus Christi Aug. 26, 2008, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.) (mandamus consolidated with\ninterlocutory appeals) (refusing to consider challenge under Rule 683 brought more than 20 days after\ntemporary injunction entered); Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s v. Bristol-Myers Squibble Co., No. 09-97-\n00540 CV, 1998 WL 429096, at *1 (Tex. App.—Beaumont July 30, 1998, no writ) (unpublished op.)\n(per curiam) (dismissing appeal because no jurisdiction to review temporary injunction that allegedly\nfails to set forth reasons for issuance where time to appeal long passed). But see Conlin v. Haun, 419\nS.W.3d 682, 685 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (recognizing that Tober holds that an\nappellate court should not, on appeal from a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction, review the\nvalidity of the trial court’s original decision to grant the injunction in the first instance, but then,\nconfusingly, determining the validity of the injunction anyway).\n\n                                                   9\n\f          DeLitta’s sole complaint in this appeal concerns the validity of the original\n\ninjunction. But, as this Court expressed in Tober, to permit DeLitta to have unlimited\n\nopportunity to “challenge the original temporary injunction grant[] without an\n\nallegation of changed conditions,” would allow them to “accomplish indirectly what\n\n[he] could not directly do . . . thereby render meaningless the appellate timetable\n\napplicable to accelerated appeals.” 668 S.W.2d at 835. The Court’s jurisdiction to\n\nreview the validity of the agreed temporary injunction has long ago expired. See Desai,\n\n813 S.W.2d at 641. This appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nII.       Litigants should be able to dispense with the formal requirements of Rule\n          683 and enter into an agreed temporary injunction without fear that one\n          party to the agreed order will later attempt to declare the order void.\n          DeLitta argues that the October 2013 Agreed Temporary Injunction is void\n\nbecause it does not state the reasons for its issuance and because the trial date stated in\n\nthe Agreed Order has now expired.44 It is “irrelevant,” DeLitta asserts, that the\n\ninjunction was agreed to.45\n\n          The ramifications of DeLitta’s position, if accepted by this Court, are\n\nmomentous. Agreed temporary injunctions are entered in Texas state courts almost\n\ndaily. The reason for their issuance need not be stated; they are issued because they\n\nare agreed. And rarely would opposing counsel agree to an injunction that stated any\n\n\n\n\n44\n     Br. at 12-14\n45\n     Br. at 15\n\n                                            10\n\fother reason for its issuance, as certainly it is not good strategy to concede that the\n\nproponent of the temporary injunction will otherwise suffer harm at your hands.\n\n      Texas law has run amuck on this point. A careful study of supreme court\n\nprecedent will lead the Court to the logical holding that parties can agree to a temporary\n\ninjunction that does not meet all the requirements of Rule 683 and, once agreed, the\n\nparties waive their right to challenge the propriety of the injunction absent fraud,\n\ncollusion, or misrepresentation.\n\nA.    Neither this Court nor the Texas Supreme Court has held an agreed\n      injunction void for failure to strictly comply with Rule 683, yet other\n      appellate courts are split on the issue.\n      The requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 are, Schaefer concedes,\n\n“mandatory and must be strictly followed” when a court enters a contested temporary\n\ninjunction. Qwest Commc’ns Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 337 (Tex. 2000) (per\n\ncuriam); Interfirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr. Co., 715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.\n\n1986) (per curiam). But the Texas Supreme Court has never intimated that parties\n\ncannot agree to the entry of a temporary injunction that does not fully comport with\n\nRule 683.\n\n      DeLitta cites several appellate court decisions for the controversial proposition\n\nthat “Rule 683’s mandatory requirements are, in fact, mandatory—and cannot be\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fwaived.”46 But he sweeps under the rug the split of authority on the issue—perhaps a\n\nsign that he does not want to defend the cases he cites.\n\n       A persuasive case on all fours is Cleere v. City of Mesquite, 594 S.W.2d 831 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 1980, no writ). The parties agreed to the entry of an injunction. Years\n\nlater, on appeal, the party restrained by the temporary injunction argued it was void for\n\nfailing to comply with Rule 683. As here, the party complained the agreed injunction\n\ndid not state the reasons for its issuance. The Dallas court was unpersuaded:\n\n       Although the reasons are not specified in the order, this defect does not\n       invalidate the injunction under the circumstances shown here. The\n       purpose of the requirement for reasons is to inform the violator of why\n       he is enjoined. When a party agrees to an injunction, he is in no position\n       to complain that he was not informed of the reasons.\n\nId. at 833 (citations omitted). In other words, a party cannot void an order for failing\n\nto state the reasons for its issuance when the reason the order was entered was simply\n\nbecause the parties asked it to. By agreeing to an injunction, and joining in the motion\n\nto enter it, as DeLitta did here, any complaints about the injunction are waived.\n\n       Another court of appeals likewise found waiver in Henke v. Peoples State Bank of\n\nHalletsville, 6 S.W.3d 717, 719 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1999, dis’d w.o.j.). The\n\nparties in that case, as here, agreed to a temporary injunction. One party challenged the\n\nagreed order on appeal. The court did not take the bait. It relied on solid precedent\n\n\n\n46\n  Br. at 15 (emphasis in original) (citing Poole v. U.S. Money Reserve Inc., No. 09-08-137-CV, 2008 WL\n4735602 (Tex. App.—Beaumont, Oct. 30, 2008, no pet.); Conlin v. Haun, 419 S.W.3d. 682, 686-87\n(Tex. App. Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.)).\n\n                                                 12\n\fthat “a party may not appeal from or attack a judgment to which he has agreed, absent\n\nallegation and proof of fraud, collusion, or misrepresentation.” Id. at 720.\n\n          This Court has recognized the split of authority on this issue47 and even has\n\nprecedent on both sides of the issue. In Emerson v. Fires Out, Inc., the issue arose, not in\n\nthe context of an agreed injunction, but in the context of simple error preservation. 735\n\nS.W.2d 492 (Tex. App.—Austin 1987, no writ). The temporary injunction did not\n\nprovide reasons for its issuance, in violation of Rule 683, but the appellant had not\n\nobjected to the omission in the trial court. This Court held that error was waived. Id.\n\nat 493.       It explained that “[p]rinciples of sound judicial administration support\n\napplication of the waiver rule” in this context:\n\n          It serves no good purpose to permit appellants to lie in wait and present\n          this error in form for the first time on appeal. On proper request, the\n          district court could easily have added to the judgment a description of the\n          specific harm avoided by granting the temporary injunction. Appellants\n          would then have obtained proper notice of the district court’s reasoning\n          and appellate review would have been facilitated.\n\nId. at 494.\n\n          Yet, more recently, in the context of related Rule 684, the Court reached the\n\nopposite result. A temporary injunction was entered in Chambers v. Rosenberg without\n\nordering a bond, in violation of Rule 684. 916 S.W.2d 633 (Tex. App.—Austin 1996,\n\nwrit denied) (per curiam). The failure to require a bond, the Court held, made the\n\ninjunction void, not just voidable. Id. at 635. Contrary to its prior decision in Emerson\n\n\n47\n     David Jason W. & Pydia, Inc. v. State, 212 S.W.3d 513, 520 n.4 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, no pet.).\n\n                                                    13\n\f(a decision not mentioned in Chambers), the Court found that “the strong theme of\n\nliteral construction of the rule convinces us that we should construe the rule literally in\n\nthis case.” Id. Notably, however, the Court recognized that “none of the cited cases\n\nexplicitly concerns an agreed order.” The Court was nevertheless “persuaded” to hold\n\nthe injunction void “because the parties here did not explicitly waive the protection of\n\na bond.” Id.\n\n       Despite its equivocal precedent on the issue, this Court has never addressed the\n\nprecise rationale of Henke: “a party may not appeal from or attack a judgment to which\n\nhe has agreed, absent allegation and proof of fraud, collusion, or misrepresentation.”\n\nSee 6 S.W.3d at 720. Henke was correct to apply this general rule in the context of agreed\n\ntemporary orders. After all, Texas law strongly favors and encourages voluntary and\n\norderly dispute resolution. Schlumberger Tech. Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171, 178 (Tex.\n\n1997). “The law has always favored the resolution of controversies through\n\ncompromise and settlement rather than through litigation and it has always been the\n\npolicy of the law to uphold and enforce such contracts if they are fairly made and are\n\nnot in contravention of some law or public policy.” Hernandez v. Telles, 663 S.W.2d 91,\n\n93 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1983, no writ). Agreements should be encouraged, particularly\n\nearly in litigation, to open the door to communication and, hopefully, compromise.\n\nNothing in Rules 683 or 684 governing the scope or form of temporary injunctions\n\noverrides this policy favoring compromise. The Court should reconcile its conflicting\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fprecedent in favor of voluntary dispute resolution and hold that parties may agree to\n\ndispense with the procedural protections of Rules 683 and 684.\n\nB.     The cases DeLitta cites are distinguishable.\n       DeLitta cites three cases for the proposition that “Rule 683’s mandatory\n\nrequirements cannot be waived.”48 These cases are distinguishable from this case.\n\n       Most significantly, neither Poole nor Gray Wireline involve an injunction that was\n\nentered into voluntarily. Gray Wireline does not appear to involve an agreed injunction\n\nat all. 374 S.W.3d at 467. And the party seeking relief in Poole agreed to the injunction\n\n“as to form” only. 2008 WL 4735602, at *11 (“Agreed as to Form Only”).\n\n       Here, however, the parties signed the temporary injunction with the notation\n\n“agreed as to form and content.”49 This distinction is significant. Approving a judgment\n\n“as to form” is a “professional courtesy”—“a usual and harmless procedure.” Cisneros\n\nv. Cisneros, 787 S.W.2d 550, 552 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1990, no writ). “Approval as to\n\nsubstance,” on the other hand, means the signatory agrees that all the essential\n\nrequirements have been met. Claxton v. Fork Water Control & Improvement Dist. No. 1,\n\n220 S.W.3d 537, 544 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007, pet. denied). A party who approves\n\nthe substance of an order is precluded from later arguing that statutory requirements have\n\nnot been met. Cisneros, 787 S.W.2d at 552 (counsel’s approval of form of judgment\n\n\n\n48\n   Br. at 15-16 (citing Conlin v. Haun, 419 S.W.3d. 682 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.);\nGray Wireline Serv., Inc. v. Cavanna, 374 S.W.3d 464 (Tex. App.—Waco 2011, no pet.); Poole v. U.S. Money\nReserve Inc., No. 09-08-137-CV, 2008 WL 4735602 (Tex. App.—Beaumont, Oct. 30, 2008, no pet.)).\n49\n   CR121 (emphasis added)\n\n                                                  15\n\fprecluded former husband from asserting that judgment did not meet statutory\n\nrequirements for child support).\n\n          The signature on the temporary injunction by DeLitta’s attorney signifies that all\n\nessential requirements are met. Claxton, 220 S.W.3d at 544; Cisneros, 787 S.W.2d at 552.\n\nHis complaint here that the injunction omitted one requirement—the reasons for its\n\nissuance—is belied by the signatures on the document and thus has no merit.\n\n          Conlin and Gray Wireline involve the trial court’s failure to provide a trial date on\n\nthe agreed injunction itself. See Conlin, 419 S.W.3d. at 687; Gray Wireline, 374 S.W.3d at\n\n472. Here, in contrast, the agreed injunction did set a trial date.50 Thus, the agreed\n\ninjunction is not “void on its face,” as found in other cases. See Gray Wireline, 374\n\nS.W.3d at 472.\n\n          DeLitta twists these cases to apply to the facts here by arguing that, because the\n\nAgreed Order “no longer carries an effective trial date,” it is somehow retroactively\n\nvoid—a “nullity” at its very issuance. DeLitta cites no cases to support this nonsensical\n\nposition. Several Texas cases undercut DeLitta’s argument. For example, in In re Kahn,\n\nthe Beaumont court of appeals held that a trial court may hold a litigant in contempt\n\nafter the trial date set in the original temporary injunction when the original trial date is\n\nlater continued. No. 09-14-00028-CV, 2014 WL 199024, at *1 (Tex. App.—Beaumont\n\nJan. 16, 2014, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). A Houston court of appeals has come to\n\n\n\n50\n     CR121 (setting case for trial on April 7, 2014)\n\n                                                       16\n\fa similar conclusion. Parham Family Ltd. P ’ship v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (rejecting the argument that a temporary injunction\n\nexpired because the order stated it was set for trial on a particular date but was later\n\ncontinued several times). If an injunction immediately became a “nullity” upon the\n\npassing of the stated trial date, as DeLitta argues here, these cases would have come out\n\ndifferently.51\n\nC.     Cases that appear to prohibit agreed temporary injunctions misconstrue\n       Texas Supreme Court precedent and are not soundly reasoned.\n       To the extent Conlin or Poole can be read to broadly support DeLitta’s proposition\n\nthat “Rule 683’s mandatory requirements cannot be waived,” they were wrongly\n\ndecided. Both cases rely on a single case from San Antonio. In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d\n\n268 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding).52 Garza reaches the radical result\n\nthat a party can agree to be bound by a temporary injunction and then, later, seek the\n\naide of the appellate courts to renege on that agreement when the party no longer\n\ndesires to be bound by its terms. The reasoning the Garza court offers to support this\n\nview of Texas law is questionable, at best.\n\n\n\n51\n   DeLitta suggests he never agreed to the terms of the Agreed Order beyond the original April 7,\n2014. But DeLitta asked for the agreed injunction to be enforced after the April 7 trial date.\nSuppCR121. Thus, the trial court was reasonable in rejecting any factual argument that DeLitta did\nnot intend to be bound throughout the entirety of this litigation.\n52\n   See Poole, 2008 WL 4735602, at *11–12 (relying on Garza); Conlin, 419 S.W.3d at 686 (relying on\nGarza and In re Corcoran, 343 S.W.3d 268, 269 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, orig.\nproceeding), which also had followed Garza). This Court has also cited Garza favorably in a\nmemorandum opinion. See In re Krueger, No. 03-12-00838-CV, 2013 WL 2157765, at *9 n.7 (Tex.\nApp.—Austin May 16, 2013, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.).\n\n                                               17\n\f           It is worth noting, as an initial matter, that Garza would have come out differently\n\nhad it been presented in this Court. This Court would likely follow Tober v. Turner of\n\nTexas, 668 S.W.2d 831 (Tex. App.—Austin 1984, no writ) and its progeny. As explained\n\npreviously,53 this line of cases holds that unless the original temporary injunction is\n\ntimely appealed, an appellate court—on review of a subsequent order related to the\n\noriginal injunction—will presume that the trial court’s initial decision to grant the\n\ntemporary injunction was proper and will not consider any issues that could have been\n\nraised in a prior appeal. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835; see also Desai, 813 S.W.2d at 641 (no\n\njurisdiction to review original temporary injunction that failed to include trial date). In\n\nGarza, the allegedly void injunction had been entered two years prior, with no appeal\n\ntaken. 126 S.W.3d at 270. The objection that the injunction was void was not raised\n\nuntil the denial of a second round of competing motions to dissolve and for contempt.\n\nId. Thus, pursuant to Tober, this Court would likely have denied the Garza petition on\n\nthis ground alone.\n\n           But Garza is wrong for other reasons too. Garza held that a temporary injunction\n\nthat does not comply with Rules 683 and 684 is void, not voidable, and, as such, a party\n\ndoes not waive its right to attack the injunction—even if the party agreed to its issuance.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Garza court relied heavily on two per curiam opinions\n\nfrom the Texas Supreme Court: Qwest, 24 S.W.3d at 334; Interfirst, 715 S.W.2d at 641.\n\n\n\n53\n     See infra, Sec. I.\n\n                                                18\n\f       Importantly, however, neither Qwest nor Interfirst concerned an agreed temporary\n\ninjunction. Interfirst is a two-paragraph opinion that mentions nothing about the entry\n\nof the injunction. In Qwest, the parties reached a tentative agreement concerning the\n\ninjunction at the entry hearing, which they then read into the record, but “[u]ltimately,\n\nthe parties could not agree to the terms of the written order to be submitted to the trial\n\ncourt.” 23 S.W.3d at 335. So neither opinion addressed whether parties may agree to\n\ndispense with the requirements of Rule 683 and 684. In fact, the Qwest court stated that\n\nthe “single issue in this petition is whether the trial court’s interlocutory order is a\n\ntemporary injunction.” Id. Anything the Court wrote about the voidability of an\n\ninjunction was not relevant to the “single issue” before it and was thus dicta.\n\n       Equally critical is the actual language used in Qwest and Interfirst. In both cases,\n\nthe court stated that an order that does not adhere to the requirements of the injunction\n\nrules “is subject to being declared void and dissolved.” Qwest, 24 S.W.3d at 337; Interfirst,\n\n715 S.W.2d at 641. If an order is “subject to being declared void,” it is voidable. “[T]he\n\nkey distinction between a void act and a voidable act . . . is a party’s ability—either\n\nthrough its own action or through the judicial process—to disaffirm, ratify, or confirm\n\na voidable act.” Wood v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 439 S.W.3d 585, 591 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist] 2014, pet. filed). In other words, a voidable order is “subject to\n\nbeing declared void,” upon an affirmative act by a party or court. See Cummings v. Powell,\n\n8 Tex. 80, 80 (1852) (“[A] voidable act is one which is obligatory upon others until\n\ndisaffirmed by the party with whom it originated, and which may be subsequently\n\n                                             19\n\fratified or confirmed.”). A void order, on the other hand, “is entirely null, not binding\n\non either party and not susceptible of ratification.” Id.\n\n       The Garza court rejected this argument, emphasizing the Court’s explanation in\n\nQwest that, in InterFirst, the court “declared the temporary injunction void.” Garza, 126\n\nS.W.3d at 273. But, even assuming this dicta has any meaning, the declaration in\n\nInterFirst does not answer the question of whether a non-compliant temporary\n\ninjunction is void or voidable. The declaration in InterFirst was made because a party,\n\nat that point, had challenged the order. The voidable order, when challenged (or\n\n“disaffirmed,” to use the Cummings language), was, at that moment, declared void.\n\n      Texas supreme court cases actually deciding the issue of whether an order is void\n\nor merely voidable are far more instructive than Qwest and InterFirst, which do not.\n\nThese cases emphasize that void orders are “rare.” Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline v.\n\nSchaefer, 364 S.W.3d 831, 836 (Tex. 2012); In re U.S. Silica Co., 157 S.W.3d 434, 438–39\n\n(Tex. 2005) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). A judgment or order is void only when it\n\nis apparent that the court rendering it had no jurisdiction of the parties, no jurisdiction\n\nof the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the judgment or order, or no capacity to\n\nact as a court. Mapco, Inc. v. Forrest, 795 S.W.2d 700, 703 (Tex. 1990) (orig. proceeding)\n\n(per curiam). The high court has applied this principal in the context of allegedly\n\nerroneous temporary injunctions and emphasized: “[I]t is evident that the writ was not\n\nwholly void for want of jurisdiction, but at most was only voidable as to some of the\n\nacts sought to be restrained. . . . If the district had jurisdiction of the parties and the\n\n                                            20\n\fmatter adjudicated, the injunction cannot be said to be absolutely void.” Ex Parte\n\nKimberlin, 126 Tex. 60, 66 (1935).\n\n       The same is true of an injunction issued without precise compliance with Rule\n\n683. Judgments which are rendered without observance of statutory requirements\n\nwhich are purely procedural are not void, however irregular or erroneous they may be.\n\nId. (“Absent one of those rare circumstances that makes the [order] void, the mere fact\n\nthat an action by a court [ ] is contrary to a statute, constitutional provision or rule of\n\ncivil or appellate procedure makes it ‘voidable’ or erroneous.”); see also Brazzel v. Murray,\n\n481 S.W.2d 801, 803 (Tex. 1972); Ex Parte Coffee, 328 S.W.2d 283, 234 (Tex. 1959)\n\n(“Judgments which are rendered without observance of statutory requirements which\n\nare purely procedural are not void, however irregular or erroneous they may be.”).\n\n       Thus, contrary to the holding in Garza, non-compliance with Rule 683 makes an\n\ninjunction voidable, not void. The Rule 683 requirements are “purely procedural.”\n\nThose requirements do not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the parties or the\n\nsubject matter. Thus, an order that does not strictly comply with Rule 683 is “subject\n\nto being declared void,” if “disaffirmed,” but is not void when entered. As a voidable\n\norder, a defective temporary injunction is subject to all equitable principles, including\n\nestoppel and waiver.\n\n       Garza led multiple courts astray in concluding otherwise, and this Court should\n\nnot follow its sister courts down this flawed path. Of course, litigants can agree to\n\ndispense with procedural protections afforded by the Texas Rules of Procedure,\n\n                                             21\n\fincluding those in Rule 683. They do so every day—from the beginning of a suit54 to\n\nthe end.55 And Texas’ policy favors doing so. The procedural requirements governing\n\ntemporary injunctions are not special and should not be treated any differently than\n\nTexas’ other procedural requirements and protections.\n\nD.      DeLitta is estopped from now challenging the Agreed Order because he\n        agreed to its issuance and has himself sought to enforce it.\n        Because any deficiencies in the form of the temporary injunction make the\n\ninjunction simply voidable, and not void, DeLitta’s complaints are subject to general\n\nprinciples of equity and error preservation. See Roccaforte v. Jefferson Cnty., 341 S.W.3d\n\n919, 923 (Tex. 2011). The equitable principles that apply to bar DeLitta’s objections to\n\nthe Agreed Order are myriad.\n\n        First and foremost, DeLitta agreed to the temporary injunction. A party may not\n\nappeal from or attack a judgment to which he has agreed, absent allegation and proof\n\nof fraud, collusion, or misrepresentation. Henke, 6 S.W.3d at 720. As the Texas\n\nSupreme Court succinctly stated: “consent takes away error.” Dunman v. Hartwell, 9\n\nTex. 495, 496 (1853). “Having consented to the action of the court in entering” the\n\ntemporary injunction, DeLitta “waive[d] all errors committed or contained in the\n\njudgment, thus leaving nothing which could properly be considered by an appellate\n\n\n\n54\n   For example, issuance, service, and return of citation are mandatory and the failure to strictly comply\nwith the governing procedural rules “renders the attempted service of process invalid and of no\neffect.” Uvalde Country Club v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 690 S.W.2d 884, 885 (Tex. 1985). Yet parties\ncan agree to waive service. Deen v. Kirk, 508 S.W2d 70, 71 (Tex. 1974).\n55\n   Parties may also agree to waive a supersedeas bond. See TEX. R. APP. P. 24.1(a)(1).\n\n                                                   22\n\fcourt, except want of jurisdiction.” See DeLee v. Allied Fin. Co., 408 S.W.2d 245, 247\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.— Dallas 1966, no writ).\n\n        This is particularly true when, as here, the party objecting to the temporary\n\ninjunction twice acknowledged its binding effect. The parties proceeded for over eight\n\nmonths in this litigation under the terms of the Agreed Order and in full\n\nacknowledgement of its binding force. “A litigant cannot treat a judgment as both right\n\nand wrong.” Carle v. Carle, 234 S.W.2d 1002, 1004 (Tex. 1950). Rather, a party who\n\naccepts the benefits of a judgment is estopped from challenging the judgment by appeal.\n\nSee Tex. State Bank v. Amaro, 87 S.W.3d 538, 544 (Tex. 2002).\n\n        DeLitta, just a few months after entry of the injunction, sought to enforce some\n\nprovisions of the injunction56—those still desirable to him. This motion was heard\n\n(along with a competing motion by Schaefer) on April 14, 2014—after the April 7, 2014\n\ntrial date set in the Agreed Order.57 Around the same time, DeLitta also sought to limit\n\nthe powers of the provisional member who was appointed and selected under the terms\n\nof the agreed temporary injunction.58 This Court should refuse to allow DeLitta to treat\n\nthe temporary injunction “as both right and wrong.” Having pursued the benefits of\n\ninjunctive terms when it suited him, he is now estopped from challenging the judgment\n\nhere.\n\n\n\n56\n   SuppCR21\n57\n   Compare SuppCR121 (noting date of hearing) and CR121 (Agreed Order setting trial date)\n58\n   SuppRR60–70\n\n                                              23\n\f        Finally, as previously explained,59 a party waives any challenge to a temporary\n\ninjunction by not appealing the injunction when it is first signed. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d\n\nat 834. “A motion to dissolve may not be used as a means of evading or expanding the\n\nrules applicable to appealing interlocutory orders.” Id. Thus, unless a temporary\n\ninjunction order is timely appealed, appellate courts “must presume the trial court’s\n\ninitial decision to grant the temporary injunction was proper.” Murphy v. McDaniel, 20\n\nS.W.3d at 879. DeLitta’s sole complaint on appeal concerns the validity of the original\n\ninjunction. But the injunction issued in October 2013. The 20 day window to challenge\n\nthe injunction has long since passed. DeLitta waived his right to challenge the\n\ntemporary injunction in this late appeal.\n\nIII.    The trial court was within its discretion to deny DeLitta’s motion because\n        the Agreed Order is enforceable as a Rule 11 Agreement.\n        Conspicuously missing from DeLitta’s brief is the fact that the trial court had\n\npreviously enforced the Agreed Order as a valid and binding Rule 11 agreement. On\n\nJune 19, 2014, the trial court signed an order enforcing the Agreed Order.60 The order\n\nexpressly found it was being enforced, not just as a temporary injunction, but also as a\n\nRule 11 agreement.61 The court’s order emphasized that “all parties [shall] strictly abide\n\nby the terms of the” Agreed Order.62\n\n\n59\n   See infra, Sec. I\n60\n   SuppCR193\n61\n   SuppCR192 (finding that the Agreed Order “is an agreed order approved as to ‘form and content’\nby all parties, signed by the court and filed in the clerk’s office” and “is enforceable as a court order\nand as a Rule 11 agreement between the parties”)\n62\n   Id. (emphasis in original)\n\n                                                   24\n\f        The trial court was correct to do so. The parties’ agreement meets all the\n\nrequirements of Rule 11 and is thus a valid agreement, even if it does not meet the\n\nrequirements of a valid temporary injunction under Rule 683. As such, the trial court\n\nhad a ministerial duty to enforce the Agreed Order as a Rule 11 agreement. See Fortis\n\nBenefits v. Cantu, 234 S.W.3d 642, 651 (Tex. 2007); Scott-Richter v. Taffarello, 186 S.W.3d\n\n182, 189 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied) (“A trial court has a ministerial\n\nduty to enforce a valid Rule 11 agreement.” (internal citations omitted)). Dissolving the\n\nAgreed Order would have been a breach of that obligation. Thus, the trial court’s order\n\nshould be affirmed on this basis. See generally K-Mart Corp. v. Honeycutt, 24 S.W.3d 357,\n\n360 (Tex. 2000) (per curiam) (an appellate court may affirm on any meritorious ground);\n\nC.W. 100 Louis Henna, Ltd. v. El Chico Rest. of Tex., L.P., 295 S.W.3d 748, 753 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2009, no pet.) (same).63\n\nA.      The Texas Supreme Court allows enforcement of litigation-related\n        agreements under Rule 11 even when the agreement might not otherwise\n        be enforceable as an agreed judgment.\n        Even if the agreed temporary injunction is unenforceable as a judgment, it is\n\nundoubtedly enforceable in contract. Padilla v. LaFrance is dispositive. 907 S.W.2d 454\n\n63\n  The trial judge that signed the June 19 order was not the same judge. But the trial court knew that\nthe Agreed Order had been enforced previously as a Rule 11 agreement. CR372-76 (arguing the trial\ncourt had a ministerial duty to enforce the Agreed Order as a Rule 11). Under the central docket\nsystem, trial judges are reluctant to overrule prior rulings of their colleagues. See TRAVIS CO. DIST.\nCT. L.R. 1.4 (“A request to be heard on a motion for new trial or any other motion challenging a prior\nruling, except one by default, must be presented to the judge who made the ruling, including a visiting\njudge.”),       available      at      https://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/courts/docs/local_rules\n_civildistrict.pdf (last visited April 29, 2015). Thus, the trial court was within its discretion to deny\nDeLitta’s motion on this purely procedural ground. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835 (trial court has no duty\nto reconsider the propriety of the granting of a temporary injunction).\n\n                                                  25\n\f(Tex. 1995). Padilla was a personal injury case. Id. at 455. Through a series of\n\ncommunications, the parties appeared to reach a settlement agreement. Id. at 455–56.\n\nWhen the plaintiff refused to accept payment, the defendant filed a counterclaim in the\n\npending action seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement. Id. at 457. Both sides\n\nmoved for summary judgment on the counterclaim. Id. The trial court found that the\n\nseries of emails did not constitute an enforceable agreement under Rule 11 and granted\n\nsummary judgment for the plaintiff.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court reversed. It first found that, contrary to the trial\n\ncourt’s ruling, the parties did have an enforceable agreement under Rule 11. Id. at 461.\n\nIt then addressed the plaintiffs’ argument that the settlement agreement, if one was\n\nreached, was unenforceable because the plaintiffs withdrew consent before judgment\n\nwas rendered. Absent consent, the plaintiffs argued, a trial court has no authority to\n\nrender an agreed judgment. Id.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court disagreed. The agreement, the Court said, was\n\nenforceable in contract even if it would not meet the requirements of an agreed\n\njudgment. Id. It explained:\n\n      The LaFrances . . . confuse the requirements for an agreed judgment with\n      those for an enforceable settlement agreement. Although a court cannot\n      render a valid agreed judgment absent consent at the time it is rendered,\n      this does not preclude the court, after proper notice and hearing, from\n      enforcing a settlement agreement complying with Rule 11 even though\n      one side no longer consents to the settlement. The judgment in the latter\n      case is not an agreed judgment, but rather is a judgment enforcing a\n      binding contract.\n\n\n                                          26\n\fId.\n\n      Like the plaintiffs in Padilla, DeLitta “confuse[s] the requirements” for a\n\ntemporary injunction for those of an enforceable Rule 11 agreement. See id. at 461.\n\nDeLitta assumes that if he attacks one the other falls. But Padilla holds otherwise.\n\nPadilla instructs that one can fail as a judgment (there, for lack of consent) and still be\n\nenforceable in contract. Under the same reasoning, if the Agreed Order meets the\n\nrequirements of Rule 11, it is enforceable as a Rule 11 agreement, even if it would\n\notherwise fail as a temporary injunction.\n\nB.    The Agreed Order meets all the elements of an enforceable Rule 11.\n      The October 2013 Agreed Order meets all the requirements of Rule 11 and is\n\nthus enforceable as a Rule 11 agreement. Rule 11 provides:\n\n      Unless otherwise provided in these rules, no agreement between attorneys\n      or parties touching any suit pending will be enforced unless it be in writing,\n      signed and filed with the papers as part of the record, or unless it be made\n      in open court and entered of record.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 11.\n\n      A trial court must enforce any agreement that meets the elements of Rule 11.\n\nFortis Benefits, 234 S.W.3d at 651 (“As this is a valid pretrial agreement under Rule 11,\n\nthe trial court had a duty to enforce its terms.”). Those elements are quite simple:\n\n            The agreement must be between attorneys or parties and touching\n             on a pending lawsuit;\n            The agreement must be in writing;\n            The agreement must be signed; and\n            The agreement must be made a part of the record.\n\n\n                                            27\n\f       The October 2013 order meets these requirements. Nancy Schaefer filed suit on\n\nOctober 9, 2013,64 and the parties agreed to the injunctive provisions on October 29,\n\n2013,65 while the suit was still pending.66 The agreement touched on the lawsuit in that\n\nthe 9 pages of agreed terms were intended to govern the parties’ conduct as it relates to\n\nAxiom (the company which is the subject matter of the lawsuit) during the litigation.67\n\nThe agreement was in writing.68 It was signed—“agreed as to form and content”—by\n\nall the party attorneys: Howard Carter and Mark Stromberg, attorneys for plaintiff, as\n\nwell as Teresa De Ford, attorney for the Axiom defendants, and Joe Griffin, attorney\n\nfor Michael J. DeLitta and DeLCom Properties, LLC.69 It was filed in the court’s record\n\non the same day as it was signed by the parties.70\n\n       The October 2013 order meets all the requirements of Rule 11. Accordingly, it\n\nis an enforceable agreement. The Axiom defendants “entered into and [are] bound by\n\nthe specific language in the Rule 11 agreement.” Fortis Benefits, 234 S.W.3d at 651. The\n\nCourt can affirm the trial court’s refusal to dissolve the Agreed Order on this ground.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n       For these reasons, Appellee asks that the Court to affirm the trial court’s order.\n\nAppellee seeks any other relief to which she may be entitled.\n\n64\n   CR3\n65\n   CR121\n66\n   CR2 (docket sheet)\n67\n   See CR115–23\n68\n   Id.\n69\n   CR121\n70\n   Compare CR115 (filestamp) with CR121 (date of signature)\n\n                                                28\n\fDated: May 6, 2015                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        /s/Lisa Bowlin Hobbs\n\n Donald R.

The trial court rendered judgment\nupon the jury verdict for Brazzel on July 28, 1967. The Court of Civil Appeals (Waco Court) reversed the trial court judgment\nand remanded the cause for new trial with costs assessed against Brazzel on February 6, 1969. 438 S.W.2d 382. Judgment\nbecame final November 26, 1969 when Brazzel's application for writ of error was overruled by this Court.\n\nThe Clerk of the Waco Court issued the mandate to the trial court on December 4, 1969, although Brazzel had failed to pay the\ncosts at that time as ordered by the judgment of the Waco Court and as required by Rule 443, T.R.C.P., which provides:\n          'On the rendition of a final judgment or decree in the Court of Civil Appeals, the clerk of said court shall\n          not issue and deliver the mandate of the court nor certify the proceedings to the lower court until all costs\n          accruing in the case in such appellate court have been paid, subject to the provisions of Rule 444.'\n\n\n\nRule 444, T.R.C.P., provides for the filing of affidavits of inability to pay the costs as required in Rule 443, T.R.C.P.\n\nMurray subsequently filed a motion in the Waco Court to recall the mandate because of the non-payment of the costs. This\nmotion was granted, and the mandate was recalled on January 22, 1971, and returned to the Waco Court, whereupon the Clerk\nissued a certificate on February 18, 1971, which stated: ‘Except for the Mandate of this Court issued December 4, 1969, no\nmandate in the above has been taken out.’\n\nMurray filed a motion to dismiss the cause in the trial court on February 17, 1971. On March 4, 1971 the trial court entered its\norder of dismissal relying upon Rule 445, T.R.C.P., which provides as follows:\n'In cases which have been reversed and remanded by a Court of Civil Appeals, If no mandate shall have been taken out and filed\nin the court where the cause originated within one year after the motion for rehearing is overruled or final judgment rendered,\nThen upon the filing in the court below of a certificate of the clerk of the Court of Civil Appeals where the cause was pending\nThat no mandate has been taken out, the case shall be dismissed from the docket.' (Emphasis added)\n\n\nOn appeal from the order of dismissal, the Court of Civil Appeals (Corpus Christi Court) held that the original mandate, having\nbeen mistakenly issued by the Waco Court, was void Ab initio and the wording of the Clerk's certificate need not state that\n\n\n\n\n               © 2014 Thomson Reuters.

Its nullity cannot be waived.\n\n'A voidable act is one which is not absolutely void within itself, but which is binding until disaffirmed, and which may be made\nfinally valid by failure within the proper time to have it annulled, or by subsequent ratification or confirmation.'\n\n\nIn Murchison, the Court found the judgment fraudulently obtained in the probate proceedings to be voidable, not void, holding\nthe judgment of a court having jurisdiction, if so irregularly or erroneously rendered as to make it liable to be vacated by a direct\nproceeding for this purpose, or to be reversed on appeal or writ of error, is nevertheless valid until thus vacated or reversed.\nOther early Texas cases which uphold this distinction stated in Murchison are Wheeler v. Ahrenbeak, 54 Tex. 535 (1881);\nCummings v. Powell, 8 Tex. 80 (1852); Burditt v. Howth, 45 Tex. 466 (1876); Fitch v. Boyer, 51 Tex. 336 at 344 (1876);\nSimmons v. Arnim, 110 Tex. 309, 220 S.W. 66 (1920).\n\n\nIn similar situations in which a collateral attack is brought against a judgment, the judgment has been held to be voidable and\nnot void. Moore v. Hanscom, 101 Tex. 293, 108 S.W. 150 (1908); White v. White, 142 Tex. 499, 179 S.W.2d 503 (1944). In\nEx Parte Coffee, 160 Tex. 224, 328 S.W.2d 283 (1959), this Court held that judgments which are rendered without observance\nof statutory requirements which are purely procedural are not void, however irregular or erroneous they may be.\n [2] The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure dealing with the issuance and return of the mandate subsequent to judgment of\nremand in the Court of Civil Appeals are procedural and not necessary to the jurisdiction of the trial court. Continental Casualty\nCompany v. Street, 364 S.W.2d 184 (Tex.1963). In Continental, the case had been retried and judgment entered before the\nmandate was taken out. This second judgment of the trial court upon remand was held not to be a void judgment.\n\n [3] From December 4, 1969, the date of the original mandate, until February 12, 1971, the date the original mandate was\nrecalled, a mandate was on file with the trial court in this cause. It was an unauthorized mandate, but was valid until recalled.\nIn any event, Petitioner still had an additional year to pay the costs and obtain the issuance of a mandate after the date of recall\nof the mandate. At no time has there been a period of twelve months in which no mandate has been filed with the trial court,\nas required by Rule 445, T.R.C.P., as a basis for dismissal.\n\n [4] The Corpus Court erred in holding that the mandate was void Ab initio. Until the mandate was recalled by the Waco Court\nwhich had issued it erroneously before collection of appellate costs, the mandate was a lawful order of the Court upon which\nall parties could rely.

(Henna), a tenant, appellee El Chico Restaurants of Texas, L.P. (El Chico), and the tenant's guarantor, El Chico\nRestaurants, Inc., over the proper construction of their commercial ground lease. The principal issue concerns whether air-\nconditioning units that El Chico installed on a building that the lease required it to construct are “improvements” that the lease\nobligated El Chico to maintain and deliver to Henna in good condition upon the lease's expiration, as Henna contends, or are\ntrade fixtures that are excluded from the lease's definition of “improvements,” as appellees argue. We agree with appellees that\nthe air-conditioning units are trade fixtures and not “improvements” as a matter of law. Because this is one of the grounds on\nwhich the district court could have relied in granting summary judgment for appellees, we will affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                        BACKGROUND\n\nThe material underlying facts are undisputed. On September 24, 1996, El Chico and Henna's predecessor, Boardwalk Center,\nLtd., entered into a ground lease of a parcel of land located in Round Rock that Boardwalk owned and was developing as\npart of a new retail shopping center. On the same day, El Chico Restaurants, Inc. signed an agreement to guarantee El Chico's\nobligations under the ground lease.\n\nAmong its other obligations under the ground lease, El Chico was required to construct a building on the parcel it was leasing\n(defined as the “Land”) within the permissible building area reflected in the project's site plan and “pursuant to plans and\nspecifications approved in writing by Landlord [Boardwalk].” The lease defined this “building and other improvements and\nappurtenances that may hereafter be erected” on the Land as the “Improvements” and defined the Land and Improvements\ncollectively as the “Premises.” The referenced “plans and specifications” included or depicted two 12.5–ton 1 air conditioning\nunits and two 10–ton units (the “HVAC units”), which were to be installed on top of the building.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             3\n\fC.W. 100 Louis Henna, Ltd. v. El Chico Restaurants of..., 295 S.W.3d 748 (2009)\n\n\n\n\nThe lease authorized El Chico to use the Premises to operate a “restaurant, a related cocktail lounge, such other uses as are\nincidental to the operation thereof and for any other lawful purpose,” subject to its complying with “all applicable governmental\nand regulatory requirements and regulations.” The lease was to run for an initial term expiring on the tenth anniversary of the\n“Rent Commencement Date”—a date tied to when El Chico opened for business on the Premises—subject to El *751 Chico's\nright to renew the lease for up to four additional terms of five years each. While the lease was in effect, El Chico would own the\nImprovements “hereafter constructed or placed on the Land during the Term,” but El Chico had “no right to demolish, remove or\nalter the Improvements without Landlord's prior written consent.” El Chico was further required to carry specified insurance on\nthe Premises and “take good care of the Improvements during the Term, including repairs to the interior, exterior and structure,\nit being understood that Landlord shall not be required to maintain the Premises or make any repairs to the Improvements during\nthe Term.” At the end of the lease, El Chico was required to “deliver up the Land with the Improvements then situated thereon in\ngood repair and condition, loss by fire or other casualty, condemnation, act of God, ordinary wear and tear, decay, depreciation\nand obsolescence being excepted,” whereupon the Improvements were to “be and become the property of Landlord ... without\ncompensation therefor.” However, paragraph 12 of the lease provided that “trade and business fixtures ... shall not be deemed\nto be part of the Premises but shall remain the property of Tenant.”\n\nThe “Rent Commencement Date” was in April 1997, which meant that the ten-year initial lease term ran until April 2007. The\nrecord reflects that, in April 2006, Boardwalk conveyed its interest in the Premises and the ground lease to Henna Blvd., L.L.C.,\nwhich then assigned these interests to Henna. Around the same time, El Chico gave written notice to Henna Blvd., L.L.C. that El\nChico had ceased doing business in the Premises and that it would permit the lease to expire at the end of the initial term without\nrenewing it. In this document, El Chico also waived any rights it possessed under the lease that would have prevented Henna\nBlvd., L.L.C. (or Henna, its successor) from marketing and selling or leasing the Premises, and El Chico agreed to execute a\ndocument terminating the lease upon the landlord's request if the landlord succeeded in selling or leasing the Premises.\n\nIn June 2006, El Chico sold Henna “all furniture, fixtures and equipment (collectively, the ‘Assets') located, as of this date, in the\nEl Chico® restaurant at 100 Louis Henna Boulevard, Round Rock.” Henna acknowledged and agreed that it “ha[d] inspected\nthe Assets at the Premises and [was] acquiring the Assets in their ‘AS IS' condition.” Around the same time, El Chico and Henna\namended the ground lease to provide that effective June 23, 2006, Henna would assume responsibility for paying all charges for\nutility services at the Premises, including the security alarm system, and for maintaining the grounds around the Improvements.\nHowever, El Chico continued to make monthly rental payments through the end of the initial lease term in April 2007.\n\nIn January 2007, a few months before the lease's April expiration, Henna learned that the HVAC units on top of the restaurant\nbuilding had been vandalized by copper thieves and damaged by hail. Henna obtained an estimate of $38,496 to repair the\ndamage. A series of communications ensued between the parties or their agents in which it was disputed whether Henna or\nEl Chico was responsible for repairing and/or insuring against the damage to the HVAC units. Eventually, in August and\nSeptember of that year, counsel for Henna sent letters to both El Chico and, as guarantor, El Chico Restaurants, Inc., demanding\npayment of the $38,496 estimated repair amount. In October, Henna sued these entities.\n\nHenna alleged that appellees were obligated under the ground lease to insure or *752 repair the HVAC units and had failed to\nperform. It asserted a cause of action for breach of contract and sought damages and attorney's fees. Henna filed a “traditional”\nmotion for partial summary judgment as to appellees' liability for breaching the lease. It attempted to conclusively establish each\nof the elements of its breach-of-contract cause of action; namely, that: (1) a valid contract existed between the parties; (2) Henna\nhad performed or tendered performance; (3) appellees had breached the contract; and (4) Henna was damaged as a result of the\nbreach. See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Miller, 114 S.W.3d 114, 121 (Tex.App.-Austin 2003, no pet.). Appellees filed a response\nand a “traditional” cross-motion in which they attempted to conclusively negate each of these elements, as well as Henna's\nentitlement to attorney's fees. Regarding breach, the parties joined issue as to whether the HVAC units are Improvements that\nappellees were obligated under the ground lease to repair or insure, as Henna argued, or are trade fixtures that were excluded\nfrom that obligation, as appellees contended. The parties also joined issue as to whether Henna had complied with the default or\nremedy provisions of the lease, whether Henna had incurred any damages, or whether Henna had any entitlement to attorney's\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Following a hearing, the district court rendered final judgment denying Henna's summary-judgment motion and granting\nappellees' motion without stating the specific grounds on which it relied. Henna thereafter filed a motion for new trial, which\nthe district court denied by written order following a hearing. This appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n                                                            ANALYSIS\n\nHenna brings twelve issues on appeal. It disputes whether appellees were entitled to prevail on any of the summary-judgment\ngrounds presented in their motion—specifically, whether appellees conclusively negated the elements of breach (points five\nand six), Henna's performance (points seven and eight), damages (points nine and ten), or Henna's entitlement to attorney's fees\n(point twelve). Henna also brings a corresponding set of points complaining that the district court erred in denying Henna's\nsummary-judgment motion. Henna asserts that it established each of the elements of its breach-of-contract cause of action as\na matter of law: breach (points one and two), performance (point three), and damages (point four), and that it was entitled to\nattorney's fees (point eleven).\n\n\nStandard of review\n [1] We review the district court's summary judgment de novo. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661\n(Tex.2005); Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex.2003). Summary judgment is proper when\nthere are no disputed issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\nIn deciding whether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding summary judgment, we take as true proof favorable to\nthe non-movant, and we indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubt in favor of the non-movant. Randall's Food\nMkts., Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex.1995). Where, as here, the parties file cross-motions for summary judgment\non overlapping issues, and the trial court grants one motion and denies the other, we should review the summary-judgment\nevidence supporting both motions and “render the judgment that the trial court should have rendered.” FM Props. Operating\nCo. v. City of Austin, 22 S.W.3d 868, 872 (Tex.2000).\n\n *753 [2] As the movant in a “traditional” summary-judgment motion challenging Henna's breach-of-contract cause of action,\nappellees had the initial burden of conclusively negating at least one element of that cause of action (i.e., establishing one of\nthe grounds in their motion as a matter of law). See KPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison County Hous. Fin. Corp., 988 S.W.2d\n746, 748 (Tex.1999). Assuming appellees met that burden as to at least one element, the burden shifted to Henna to present\nsummary-judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to that element or elements. See M.D. Anderson Hosp.\n& Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 24 (Tex.2000) (per curiam). Because the district court did not specify the ground on\nwhich it relied in granting appellees' motion, we may affirm the summary judgment if any ground is meritorious. State Farm\nFire & Cas. Co. v. S.S., 858 S.W.2d 374, 380 (Tex.1993).\n\nIf the district court properly granted appellees' summary-judgment motion, it follows that it did not err in denying Henna's\nmotion on the same grounds. See FM Props. Operating Co., 22 S.W.3d at 872. If we conclude that the district court erred in\ngranting appellees' motion, then we consider whether it also erred in denying Henna's motion. To prevail on its motion, Henna\nhad the burden of establishing its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law by conclusively establishing each element of its\nbreach-of-contract cause of action. See Willrich, 28 S.W.3d at 23 (citing Rhône–Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 222–\n23 (Tex.1999); Oram v. General Am. Oil Co., 513 S.W.2d 533, 534 (Tex.1974) (per curiam)).\n\n\n“Improvements” versus trade fixtures\n [3] Appellees' summary-judgment ground attacking the breach element of Henna's cause of action was premised on its\nargument that, as a matter of law, the HVAC units were “trade or business fixtures” under paragraph 12 of the ground lease and\nnot “Improvements” that the lease required them to repair or insure. Henna challenges this legal conclusion in its fifth issue,\ncontending that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on this ground because the HVAC units were instead\n“Improvements” as a matter of law, or that at least a fact issue remains as to the parties' intent. Similarly, in its first issue, Henna\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(“The intent\nof the parties regarding the right to remove additions at the termination of a lease is to be determined from the provisions of\nthe lease agreement.”).\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] When we construe a written contract, such as the ground lease, our primary concern is to ascertain and\ngive effect to the intentions the parties have objectively manifested in that instrument. Frost Nat'l Bank v. L & F Distribs., Ltd.,\n165 S.W.3d 310, 311–12 (Tex.2005) (per curiam); see Fiess v. State Farm Lloyds, 202 S.W.3d 744, 746 (Tex.2006) (“As with\nany other contract, the parties' intent is governed by what they said, not by what they intended to say but did not.”). To that end,\nwe construe the lease in its entirety, considering each part in relation to every other part so that the effect of each *754 part\non others may be determined and that no part will be rendered meaningless. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 811\n(Tex.2005); Valence Operating Co., 164 S.W.3d at 662. Contract terms are given their plain, ordinary, and generally accepted\nmeanings unless the contract itself shows them to be used in a technical or different sense. Valence Operating Co., 164 S.W.3d\nat 662. In determining the meaning of contract terms, we may also consider the context of the circumstances existing at the\ntime the contract was executed and the particular business activity sought to be served.

If, on the\nother hand, the contract is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations, it is ambiguous, which creates a fact issue as to the\nparties' intent. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 940 S.W.2d at 589. Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law. Id.\n\nAt the center of the parties' competing contentions is paragraph 12 of the lease, which explicitly excludes “trade or business\nfixtures” from “Improvements”:\n\n  12. Equipment, Fixtures and Signs\n\n     (a) Tenant shall have the right to erect, install, maintain and operate on the Premises such equipment, trade and business\n        fixtures, signs (including, without limitation, pylon signage) and other personal property as Tenant may deem necessary\n        or appropriate, and such shall not be deemed to be part of the Premises, but shall remain the property of Tenant. Any\n        such installations shall be in accordance with applicable local codes and Tenant's pylon signage and monument signage,\n        if applicable, shall be installed in those locations designated therefor as reflected in the Site Plan. At any time during the\n        Term and within thirty (30) days after the expiration or termination of the Term, Tenant shall have the right to remove\n        all or any part of Tenant's equipment, removable fixtures, signs (including, without limitation, its pylon signage, if any)\n        and other personal property from the Premises, provided that Tenant repairs all damage to the Improvements caused by\n        such removal. Any property remaining in the Improvements after such thirty (30) day period shall be deemed to have\n        been abandoned by Tenant.\n\n(Italics added.) Because the “Premises” from which “trade or business fixtures” are excluded are defined elsewhere in the lease\nto mean the “Land” plus the “Improvements,” paragraph 12 means that anything constituting a “trade or business fixture” (or,\nfor that matter, anything constituting “such equipment, ... signs ... and other personal property as Tenant may deem necessary\nor appropriate” to install or operate on the Premises) cannot be an Improvement.\n\n [9] [10] The ground lease does not contain a definition of trade or business fixtures. However, the term “trade fixture” has\nacquired a well-established, commonly understood meaning in Texas law. As one of our sister courts has observed:\n\n  The term “trade fixture” has been defined many times by the courts.... “It is now well settled that, as between a landlord and\n  his tenant, the term ‘trade fixtures' refers to and means such articles *755 as may be annexed to the realty by the tenant\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Boegner, 746 S.W.2d 25, 27 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no writ) (quoting Granberry v. Texas Pub. Serv. Co.,\n171 S.W.2d 184, 186 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1943, no writ)). It is also well established that trade fixtures are distinguished\nfrom “improvements” and other types of fixtures (i.e., personal property affixed to realty). “An improvement includes all\nadditions to the freehold except for trade fixtures which can be removed without injury to the property.” Sonnier v. Chisholm–\nRyder Co., 909 S.W.2d 475, 479 (Tex.1995); see also Reames v. Hawthorne–Seving, Inc., 949 S.W.2d 758, 761 (Tex.App.-\nDallas 1997, pet. denied) (“The class of improvements is considered to be broader than that of fixtures, which are items of\npersonalty that have become permanent parts of the realty to which they are affixed. Therefore, although all improvements are\nnot necessarily fixtures, any fixture, unless it is a trade fixture, is considered an improvement. A trade fixture is an item, which\ncan be removed without material or permanent injury to the freehold, that a tenant annexes to realty to enable the tenant to carry\non its business.” (Citations omitted.)). The rationale for these distinctions is that “[i]mprovements made by a vendor, mortgagor\nor ancestor are made to enhance the value of the estate, and to be permanent; while those made by the tenant are temporary and\nmade for purposes of his trade.” Jim Walter Window Components, 642 S.W.2d at 5 (quoting Menger v. Ward, 28 S.W. 821,\n823 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1894), rev'd on other grounds, 87 Tex. 622, 30 S.W. 853 (1895)).\n\nThe drafters' use of “trade or business fixtures” within paragraph 12 without providing definitions of these terms that would\nbe unique to this agreement suggests their intent to employ the well-established definitions and concepts set out in case law.\nAfter granting the tenant the right to install or maintain “equipment,” “trade or business fixtures,” “signs,” and “other personal\nproperty,” paragraph 12 provides the tenant a corresponding right to remove all or part of its “equipment,” “removable fixtures,”\n“signs,” and “other personal property from the Premises, provided that Tenant repairs all damage to the Improvements caused by\nsuch removal.” This usage reflects that, consistent with the common meaning of trade fixtures in Texas law, “trade or business\nfixtures” under the lease are considered to be removable personal property. Similarly, paragraph 12 excluded “trade or business\nfixtures” from the lease's definition of “Improvements,” just as trade fixtures are excluded from improvements under Texas law.\n\nAppellees conclusively established that the HVAC units at issue met the commonly understood definition of trade fixtures.\nThey presented uncontroverted summary-judgment evidence that the HVAC units were not attached to the building, but were\ndesigned to be and were placed on curbs on the roof so they could be removed and replaced without injury to the building, and\nthat such units needed to be replaced periodically as they reached the end of their useful life cycles. Appellees likewise presented\nundisputed evidence that the HVAC units here were approaching the end of their useful lives, and that the units ultimately were\nreplaced without injury to the building. Further, appellees presented uncontroverted summary-judgment evidence *756 that\nthe 45 tons of air-conditioning capacity provided by the HVAC units facilitated the building's use as a restaurant, but was many\ntimes greater than that needed if the building were to be used for other retail or office use. Several Texas courts, addressing\nsimilar facts, have held that air-conditioning units are trade fixtures as a matter of law. See Boyett, 746 S.W.2d at 27–28; White v.\nCadwallader & Co., 299 S.W.2d 189, 190–92 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1957, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Moskowitz v. Calloway, 178\nS.W.2d 878, 879–80 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1944, writ ref'd w.o.m.); cf. Nine Hundred Main, Inc. v. City of Houston, 150\nS.W.2d 468, 471–73 (Tex.Civ.App.-Galveston 1941, writ dism'd judgm't cor.) (distinguishing tenant-installed air-conditioning\nsystem that had been constructed in a manner making it an integral part of the building).\n\nHenna correctly observes that there is no rule or presumption in Texas law that air-conditioning units are always trade fixtures.\nThe issue, rather, turns on the parties' intent, which here we ascertain from the ground lease. See Tempo Tamers, Inc., 715 S.W.2d\nat 664. Henna argues that portions of the ground lease outside paragraph 12 reflect the drafter's intent that the HVAC units be\nconsidered “Improvements” under the lease and that this definition, not the commonly understood definitions of improvements\nand trade fixtures, must control. See id. at 664–66 (example of case where lease language demonstrated that “the parties in this\ncase could not have reasonably intended that ‘trade fixtures' have the legal meaning ascribed to it by the courts”). Henna relies\non paragraph 1 of the lease, which defines “Improvements” as “any building and other improvements and appurtenances that\nmay hereafter be erected” on the Land, in conjunction with paragraph 5:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Construction. The Improvements shall be constructed and situated on the Land within the permissible\n            building area reflected on the Site Plan and pursuant to plans and specifications approved in writing by\n            Landlord; provided, however, that Tenant shall have the right to revise the permissible building area and\n            the approved plans and specifications subject to Landlord's prior written consent, which consent shall\n            not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,\n            however, Landlord hereby consents to and approves of the prototypical plans and specifications which\n            are being used by Tenant on the Effective Date of this Lease and hereby agrees that Tenant shall have the\n            right to construct the Improvements without any further consent by Landlord so long as the Improvements\n            are constructed generally in accordance with such prototypical plans....\n\nHenna presented uncontroverted summary-judgment evidence that the “plans and specifications” referenced in paragraph\n5 included a drawing of a four-unit, 45–ton HVAC system like that El Chico later installed. Thus, Henna reasons, the\n“Improvements [that] shall be constructed ... pursuant to plans and specifications” under paragraph 5 included the HVAC units\nthat El Chico later installed.\n\nBased on this premise, Henna argues that paragraph 5 evinces the drafters' agreement and intent to impose an obligation on El\nChico to include the HVAC units at issue when constructing the building. Henna also relies on paragraphs 6 and 30 of the ground\nlease for a similar proposition. Paragraph 6 authorized El Chico to use the Premises “for the operation of a restaurant ... and\nfor any other lawful purpose, subject, however, to ... all applicable governmental and regulatory requirements and restrictions.”\nSimilarly, *757 paragraph 30 provided that, during the lease term, “Tenant ... shall conform to and comply with all ordinances,\nregulations and laws (federal, state, or municipal) ... affecting the Premises....” Henna presented summary-judgment evidence\nthat El Chico had obtained a certificate of occupancy for its restaurant from the City of Round Rock based on the plans and\nspecifications. From this, Henna reasons that El Chico had obligations under paragraphs 6 and 30 to install the HVAC units\nin order to comply with this “regulatory requirement.”\n\nThe existence of these agreements and obligations on the part of El Chico to install the HVAC units when constructing\nits restaurant building, Henna further reasons, distinguishes the HVAC units from a trade fixture, which, Henna asserts, is\ncharacterized by a tenant's unilateral decision to affix personalty to an existing building that the tenant has leased. Relatedly,\nHenna argues that the HVAC units were part of the consideration the landlord bargained to obtain under the ground lease. In sum,\nHenna urges that “[t]he decision to originally incorporate the HVAC system was neither unilateral nor voluntary; rather, such\ndecision was bilateral, between El Chico and its landlord, as well as required under the plans and specifications incorporated into\nthe ground lease, itself, of course, the product of arms-length negotiation between the parties, a factual distinction absolutely\ndeterminative in the present appeal.”\n\nThe chief flaw in Henna's reasoning is its foundational premise that the ground lease's definition of “Improvements”\nencompassed the HVAC units because the plans and specifications called for two 12–ton units and two 10–ton units like El Chico\ninstalled. Contrary to Henna's argument, paragraph 5 does not purport to incorporate into the lease's “Improvements” definition\nwhatever property might have been depicted in the plans and specifications. Paragraph 5 requires that “[t]he Improvements\nshall be constructed ... pursuant to [the] plans and specifications,” which means that the Improvements must be constructed\nin a manner carrying out or in conformity with the plans and specifications. 2 It does not follow from this requirement that\nany piece of property depicted in the plans and specifications, even if otherwise considered a trade fixture, equipment, or other\npersonal property, would be an Improvement. For example, appellees presented summary-judgment evidence that the plans\nand specifications also included depictions of El Chico's walk-in coolers, freezers, tables and chairs, and other trade fixtures\nor restaurant equipment. If, as Henna argues, paragraph 5 means that all property depicted in the plans and specifications is\nan “Improvement” that El Chico could not remove without the landlord's approval, it would conflict with paragraph 12, which\ngrants El Chico the right to “remove all or any part of Tenant's equipment, removable fixtures, signs ... and other personal\nproperty from the Premises, provided that Tenant repairs all damage to the Improvements caused by such removal.” We must\ninstead construe these provisions in relation to one another so as to give both effect. See Valence Operating Co., 164 S.W.3d\nat 662. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the drafters intended paragraph 5 to mean that all property depicted in the plans\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

El Chico Restaurants of..., 295 S.W.3d 748 (2009)\n\n\nand specifications is “Improvements” that El Chico could not remove and that the landlord would own after the lease expired.\nIn short, paragraph 5 does *758 not mean that the HVAC units are “Improvements” under the ground lease.\n\nWe are similarly unpersuaded by Henna's argument that the HVAC units cannot be trade fixtures because the drafters anticipated\nat the inception of the ground lease that El Chico would install such units when constructing the restaurant building. Henna\nis correct that the reported Texas cases holding that air-conditioning units are trade fixtures have involved units that a tenant\ninstalled in a preexisting building during a lease term—not, as here, a ground lease where the parties contemplated that the tenant\nwould construct a building and install the units. See Boyett, 746 S.W.2d at 27–28; White, 299 S.W.2d at 190–92; Moskowitz, 178\nS.W.2d at 879–80. Although Henna is correct as a factual matter, we disagree that the legal principle governing these decisions\nturns solely on whether or when the tenant and/or landlord anticipated that the units would be installed. The critical issue, rather,\nis whether the parties intended the air-conditioning units to be permanent additions to the building, for the landlord's ownership\nand benefit as part of the realty, or temporary additions to aid the tenant, El Chico, while it was operating a restaurant in the\nbuilding. See Jim Walter Window Components, 642 S.W.2d at 5 (quoting Menger, 28 S.W. at 823). We ascertain such intent, as\nHenna has acknowledged, from the terms of the ground lease. Id. at 4 (“The intent of the parties regarding the right to remove\nadditions at the termination of a lease is to be determined from the provisions of the lease agreement.”); see Tempo Tamers,\nInc., 715 S.W.2d at 664.\n\nThe drafters' use of “trade or business fixtures” in paragraph 12 of the ground lease, as discussed, manifests their intent to\nincorporate the commonly understood meaning of trade fixtures under Texas law. Paragraph 5 of the lease does not reflect\na contrary intent, nor do paragraphs 6 and 30, the other provisions on which Henna relies. As appellees observe, Henna's\narguments concerning the restaurant's certificate of occupancy are simply inapposite. The fact that El Chico submitted the plans\nand specifications to the City of Round Rock when obtaining a certificate of occupancy permitting it to operate a restaurant\nin the building has no bearing on whether the drafters intended the HVAC units or other property depicted in the plans and\nspecifications to be “Improvements” or trade fixtures.\n\nAppellees conclusively established that the HVAC units are trade fixtures under the established definition of that term in Texas\nlaw. Paragraph 12 explicitly excludes “trade or business fixtures” from the “Premises” and, thus, the “Improvements” under\nthe lease. In other words, the ground lease unambiguously manifests the drafters' intent that the HVAC units El Chico was\nto install on the building would be temporary additions to the realty to aid El Chico in operating a restaurant there, which El\nChico would continue to own at the lease's conclusion, and not “Improvements” that it was required to maintain or repair for\nthe landlord's benefit. We are bound to give effect to this unambiguous language as the controlling indicator of the bargain the\ndrafters intended to strike. See Willis, 199 S.W.3d at 275; J.M. Davidson, Inc., 128 S.W.3d at 229.\n\nIn a final argument, Henna asserts that El Chico “didn't consider the HVAC system a fixture” in its June 2006 sale of “all\nfurniture, fixtures and equipment” to Henna because the HVAC units did not appear in the list of property attached to the\nbill of sale. Henna suggests this evidence raises an inference that, as late as June 2006, El Chico intended or understood that\nthe HVAC units were not trade fixtures. We disagree. First, even assuming that *759 “fixtures” as used in the bill of sale\nwould have included trade fixtures, the record does not support Henna's factual premise that El Chico excluded the HVAC units\nfrom that category of property—the bill of sale explicitly covers “all furniture, fixtures and equipment, whether or not listed\nin Exhibit ‘A.’ ” Second, and more importantly, even if this evidence supported an inference as to El Chico's subjective intent\nor understanding regarding whether the HVAC units were trade fixtures, it would be incompetent to raise a fact issue as to the\nparties' intent in the face of the unambiguous ground lease. See Hubacek v. Ennis State Bank, 159 Tex. 166, 317 S.W.2d 30, 32\n(1958) (parol-evidence rule is a limitation of substantive contract law and not merely a rule of evidence).\n\nHenna's breach-of-contract claims are predicated on the legal conclusion that the HVAC units were “Improvements” under\nthe ground lease. Because the HVAC units were not “Improvements” as a matter of law, the district court properly granted\nsummary judgment for appellees on the ground that Henna cannot prove breach. Accordingly, we overrule Henna's fifth point\nof error and its corresponding first point of error.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These respective amounts, to-wit, $7,000.00, $450.00 and $250.00 were charged against\nplaintiff's interest in the community property. The balance of the property involved was held to be community property and\na commissioner was appointed to sell same under the direction of the court and divide the proceeds in accordance with the\njudgment under the direction of the court. Defendant perfected an appeal from parts of this judgment. He appealed from that\npart of the judgment declaring the three pieces of property hereinbefore described as *471 the separate property of his wife,\nfrom that portion of the judgment allowing his wife the recovery of an attorney's fee of $6500.00 and charging the same against\nhis interest in the community property.\n\n‘Appellee has filed a supplemental transcript herein which in substance shows that the commissioner under the direction and\nauthority of the court has sold all community property in accordance with the judgment, has disposed of all the money arising\ntherefrom except the sum of $2666.79 which under the order of the court he paid into the registry of the court, and was\ndischarged. Some of these distributions were requested by the defendant. The attorney's fees in the sum of $6500.00 have been\npaid and same were charged against the interest of defendant in the community. The charges made in favor of the community\nestate for indebtedness paid on obligations against property adjudged to plaintiff as her separate property have been paid to\ndefendant, that is, one-half thereof has been charged as against plaintiff's interest in the community estate and paid to the\ndefendant in the sum of $7700.00.\n\n‘In our original disposition of the case we held that the accepting by defendant of the offsets adjudged in his favor as to the\nproperty located at 5401 South Flores Street and at 344 Park Drive, each of which piece of property was adjudged to be separate\nproperty of plaintiff, estopped him from complaining of the trial judge's judgment decreeing same to be the separate property of\nplaintiff. To this view in ruling on the motion for a rehearing we still adhere. Further, in regard to the property at 605 Guadalupe\nStreet as to which appellee (plaintiff) has filed a motion for rehearing, we still adhere to the view expressed in the original\nopinion that defendant is not estopped from claiming that same is community property. In regard to the fee for $6500.00 allowed\nto plaintiff we granted defendant's motion for rehearing and rendered judgment charging said fee to the community estate of\nplaintiff and defendant. For further facts we refer to our original opinion and our opinion on our holding granting the motion\nfor rehearing, and likewise as to our reasons for the disposition made of the respective matters in controversy.’\n\n\nThe first and second questions certified are:\n‘Question No. 1. Did we err in holding that defendant was not entitled to complain on appeal of that portion of the **1004\njudgment decreeing the property at 344 Park Drive as the separate property of plaintiff and that portion of the judgment decreeing\n *472 the property at 5401 South Flores Street as the separate property of plaintiff on account of the fact that he accepted\nand collected from plaintiff's interest in the community estate one-half of the community money used in paying obligations\nagainst said property?’\n\n‘Question No. 2. Did we err in holding that defendant by his action subsequent to the rendition of the judgment had not estopped\nhimself from complaining of the court's action in decreeing the property at 605 Guadalupe Street as the separate property of\nplaintiff?’\n\n [1] [2] A litigant cannot treat a judgment as both right and wrong, and if he has voluntarily accepted the benefits of a judgment,\nhe cannot afterward prosecute an appeal therefrom. That is the general rule which appears to be universally recognized. It was\nannounced by this court in the early case of Matlow v. Cox, 25 Tex. 578. The rule is based on the principle of estoppel. It,\nhowever, is subject to the exception that ‘* * * where the reversal of a judgment cannot possibly affect an appellant's right to\nthe benefit secured under a judgment, then an appeal may be taken, * * *.’ 2 Am.Jur., Appeal and Error, Sec. 215. Numerous\nauthorities, approaching the exception from a slightly different angle, define it, in effect, in this language: Where an appellant\naccepts only that which appellee concedes, or is bound to concede, to be due him under the judgment he is not estopped to\nprosecute an appeal which involves only his right to a further recovery. Embry v. Palmer, 107 U.S. 3, 2 S.Ct. 25, 27 L.Ed. 346;\nHodges v. Smith, 34 Tex.Civ.App. 635, 79 S.W. 328, error dismissed; Tyler v. Shea, 4 N.D. 377, 61 N.W. 468, 50 Am.St.Rep.\n660; Bass v. Ring, 210 Minn. 598, 299 N.W. 679, 169 A.L.R. 980.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Whether or not this case falls within it must be determined from answers to these questions:\nCould a reversal of the portions of the judgment referred to in these two certified questions possibly affect appellant's right to\nthe benefits secured by him under the judgment? And would appellee be compelled to concede upon another trial that appellant\nhas the right to retain those benefits regardless of the outcome of the litigation?\n\n\nAs we understand the facts stated in the certificate and in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, 234 S.W.2d 907, appellee\ninstituted this suit in which she claimed that the property mentioned in these questions belonged to her in her separate right. The\nappellant claimed that it belonged to *473 the community estate. His claim was denied and he seeks to have that portion of\nthe judgment revised. As the matter now stands, appellant has been awarded and has voluntarily accepted $7,700.00 in cash on\nthe basis of a holding by the trial court that the property belongs to appellee as her separate estate, a part of which was charged\nwith an indebtedness of $15,400.00 in favor of the community. Should the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded to the\ntrial court it would become its mandatory duty to divide the estate of the parties. Article 4638, R.S.1925. If upon another trial it\nshould be adjudged that the property is community property, the court, for instance, might deem it just and right to award one\nof these lots to one party and the other two lots to the other party. Clearly, the court would have the authority to to so under the\narticle of the statutes above mentioned by making provisions for adjudicating equities. In order to restore the status quo so the\ncourt could partition it in the manner indicated it would be necessary for appellant to restore the amount ($7,700.00) received\nby him under the original judgment. The amount of the community funds remaining undistributed is much less than that sum. It\nappears, then, that if appellant should be successful in his appeal and then successful upon another trial in establishing his claim\nthat the property is community, the benefit secured by him under the judgment appealed from would necessarily be affected.\nBesides, the right of appellee to a partition of the property might well be prejudiced. She certainly would **1005 not concede\nthat appellant would be entitled to retain the money paid him on the ground that the property is not community while pressing\nhis claim that it is community. We accordingly answer the first question, ‘No,’ and the second question, ‘Yes.’\n\nQuestions 3 and 4 are as follows:\n‘Question No. 3. Did we err in holding on rehearing that defendant by his action subsequent to the rendition of the judgment had\nnot estopped himself from complaining of the court's action in charging the attorney's fees against his half of the community\nestate?’\n\n‘Question No. 4. Did we err in holding on rehearing that the attorney's fee charged by the trial court solely against the defendant's\ninterest in the community estate was as a matter of law chargeable against the community estate as a whole?’\n\n [4] [5] [6] We first consider question No. 4. The decisions of various courts of civil appeals with respect to this question\ncannot well be harmonized. *474 As we view the problem, it is not a correct approach to its solution to classify the wife's\nattorney's fees as a necessity, and then apply the rule that necessities are primarily the obligations of the community and\nsecondarily of the husband's separate estate. That reasoning fails to take into account Article 4638, supra, which provides: ‘The\ncourt pronouncing a decree of divorce shall also decree and order a division of the estate of the parties in such a way as the\ncourt shall deem just and right, having due regard to the rights of each party and their children, if any. Nothing herein shall be\nconstrued to compel either party to divest himself or herself of the title to real estate.’\n\n\nThat statute clearly vests discretion in the trial court in determining the proper division of the community estate of the parties.\nThe court is not required, as a matter of law, to divide that estate equally between them. In practical effect, a decree that the\nhusband pay all of the wife's attorney's fees may be to award him less of the community estate than that awarded to the wife,\nbut that alone does not condemn it. The attorney's fee is but a factor to be considered by the court in making an equitable\ndivision of the estate, considering the conditions and needs of the parties and all of the surrounding circumstances. We answer\nquestion No. 4, ‘Yes.’\n\nIn view of our answer to question No. 4, question No. 3 becomes immaterial.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

BES attempted to rescind the contract and in response Bristol-Myers sued. One of the conditions of coverage is\na mandatory arbitration clause. Bristol-Myers sought and was granted an anti-suit injunction designed to prevent BES from\ncommencing arbitration.\n\nBES filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Dissolve the Anti-Suit Injunction, which the trial court denied December 5,\n1997. BES then filed an interlocutory appeal from the denial of the motion to dissolve the anti-suit injunction. 1\n\n\nThe order of the trial court granting the anti-suit injunction forming the basis of this appeal was signed January 27, 1995. 2 BES'\nnotice of appeal was filed December 23, 1997 (amended notice of appeal was filed December 26, 1997). “An interlocutory\norder that is not timely appealed is not reviewable by this Court.” State v. Ruiz Wholesale Co., 901 S.W.2d 772, 775 (Tex.App.-\nAustin 1995, no writ)(citing Desai v. Reliance Mach.

BES argues none of the four\ncircumstances permitting entry of an anti-suit injunction in Texas are present and that the trial court failed to set forth specific\nreasons for issuance of an injunction. However, BES' failure to perfect an interlocutory appeal from that order precludes this\nCourt from reviewing its validity.\n\nBES did not perfect an appeal from the initial order, and the time limit for doing so has long since expired.

Chambers contends\nthat Rosenberg's actions violated an agreed temporary injunction and an agreed final judgment and permanent injunction. The\ntrial court held that the temporary injunction was void ab initio because no bond was executed. The court found that the final\njudgment was vague, ambiguous, overly broad, and unenforceable, but did not find it void; the court simply denied the motion\nfor contempt. We will affirm the order of the trial court.\n\n [1] We cannot review the denial of the motion for contempt of the agreed final judgment and permanent injunction. The denial\nof a motion for contempt is not appealable because it is not a final order. Norman v. Norman, 692 S.W.2d 655, 655 (Tex.1985);\nVelez v. DeLara, 905 S.W.2d 43, 46 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1995, no writ). We therefore overrule points three and four by\nwhich Chambers complains of the court's assessment of the final judgment.\n\n [2] [3] [4] [5] We can review the declaration that the agreed temporary injunction was void ab initio because of the lack\nof a bond. The supreme court has construed strictly the requirement of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 684 that, before a trial\ncourt issues a temporary restraining order or temporary injunction, the applicant shall execute and file with the clerk a bond to\nthe adverse party. Goodwin v. Goodwin, 456 S.W.2d 885, 885 (Tex.1970) (holding that the failure of the applicant to file a bond\nbefore the issuance of the temporary injunction renders the injunction void ab initio ); Lancaster v. Lancaster, 155 Tex. 528, 291\nS.W.2d 303, 308 (1956) (holding that bond provisions of Rule 684 are mandatory *635 and that an injunction issued without\na bond is void); see also Ex parte Jordan, 787 S.W.2d 367, 368 (Tex.1990) (holding temporary restraining order void for lack\nof requirement of separate bond); Ex parte Lesher, 651 S.W.2d 734, 735–36 (Tex.1983) (holding temporary restraining order\nvoid because court waived bond); but see Ludewig v. Houston Pipeline Co., 737 S.W.2d 15, 16 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi.\n1987, no writ) (holding that errors other than jurisdiction render the judgment voidable within the standard appellate timetable).\nThe court has held that temporary orders filed without the bond are void, not merely voidable. Goodwin, 456 S.W.2d at 885;\nLesher, 651 S.W.2d at 735–36. Though none of the cited cases explicitly concerns an agreed order, we find the strong theme of\nliteral construction of the rule convinces us that we should construe the rule literally in this case; we are particularly persuaded\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Rosenberg, 916 S.W.2d 633 (1996)\n\n\nto do so because the parties here did not explicitly waive the protection of a bond. The temporary injunction was void for lack\nof a bond. We overrule point two.\n\n [6] Chambers contends by point one that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in improperly setting aside the consent\nagreements. Our affirmance of the conclusion that the temporary injunction was void, however, defeats this claim. The supreme\ncourt has held that a judgment which discloses its invalidity on its face is a nullity and may be disregarded anywhere at any\ntime. Fulton v. Finch, 162 Tex. 351, 346 S.W.2d 823, 827 (1961). Though courts generally apply this rule only for jurisdictional\ndefects, the supreme court's insistence that temporary injunctions issued without bonds are void convinces us that the trial\ncourt correctly disregarded the temporary injunction here. The trial court did not set aside the final judgment and permanent\ninjunction. We overrule point one.\n\nWe do not reach point five, which concerned the scope of the temporary injunction. We need not consider the scope of a void\norder.\n\nWe affirm the order of the trial court.\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                   © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Baughman, Baytown, for appellant.\n\nRon Hayes, John R. Coe, Houston, for appellee.\n\nBefore OSBORN, C.J., and WOODARD and KOEHLER, JJ.\n\n\n\n                                                           OPINION\n\nKOEHLER, Justice.\n\nThis is an appeal from a judgment awarding $3,500.00 in child support arrearages following a non-jury hearing. We affirm.\n\nAppellant brings three points of error, complaining (1) that the original divorce decree being too ambiguous to be enforced\nby contempt is also too ambiguous to support a judgment for arrearages, (2) that the provision in the decree for an automatic\nincrease in child support in the second year is unenforceable, and (3) that the judgment for arrearages, being an enforcement\norder, does not meet the requirements of Section 14.33 of the Family Code and is therefore unenforceable.\n\nThe parties were divorced on January 19, 1982. Appellee was named managing conservator of the only child of the marriage.\nIn the decree, the court found that the parties had entered into a written agreement containing provisions for conservatorship\nand child support, which were found to be “in the best interest of the child.” Appellant, as possessory conservator, was ordered\nto make child support payments of $300.00 per month beginning on February 1, 1982. The decree then provided that:\n\n            Beginning with the first payment due in the second year of such support payments, said support shall\n            automatically, without further action from the Court, increase to the sum of THREE HUNDRED FIFTY\n            AND NO/100 ($350.00) DOLLARS per month,....\n\nOriginally brought as a contempt motion, Appellee pled, and the evidence supported a finding, that Appellant had failed to make\nthe additional $50.00 monthly payment *551 commencing with the payment due on February 1, 1983 and extending for each\nmonth through December 1988. At a pretrial hearing, upon a suggestion by the court that the order pertaining to the automatic\nincrease was too ambiguous to be enforceable by contempt, Appellee amended her pleadings by requesting a judgment for\nthe arrearages, in addition to enforcement by contempt. However, at the commencement of the hearing, Appellee waived the\ncontempt action, requesting relief only by way of a money judgment for the arrearage.\n\n [1] Although it is not necessary for a resolution of this appeal, we do not conclude that the quoted portion of the decree was\nambiguous. While it undoubtedly could have been made clearer, it would be difficult to construe “beginning with the first\npayment due in the second year of such support payments” to mean any date other than February 1, 1983. Had the first payment\nunder the decree been due on December 1, 1982 instead of February 1, 1982, it would have made no sense to argue that the first\npayment in the second year could have meant January 1, 1983 or some date other than December 1, 1983. But assuming that\nthere was some ambiguity, the worst that could have been contended was that the increased payments were to begin with the\npayment due on January 1, 1983. Appellee sought a judgment for the arrearages commencing with the payment due February 1,\n1983 and waived enforcement by contempt. The fact there may have been some ambiguity as to whether the increased payment\nshould start on January 1 or February 1, 1983 would not make the order void for vagueness for payments due from February 1,\n1983 forward. Furthermore, since the provisions in the decree relating to conservatorship and child support were based on the\nwritten agreement of the parties, the ambiguity in this case would be susceptible to interpretation by the trial court after hearing\nthe evidence as in the case of an agreed judgment. Richey v. Bolerjack, 594 S.W.2d 795 (Tex.Civ.App.—Tyler 1980, no writ);\nJohnson v. Johnson, 572 S.W.2d 364, 366 (Tex.Civ.App.—Amarillo 1978, no writ). This is particularly true where, as in this\ncase, the petitioner is not seeking enforcement by contempt or summary process. Point of Error No. One is overruled.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              2\n\fCisneros v. Cisneros, 787 S.W.2d 550 (1990)\n\n\n\n\n [2] Appellant cites several cases for the proposition that if a support order is void for purposes of contempt, it is also void for\nthe purpose of a motion to reduce the arrearage to judgment. Howard v. Texas Department of Human Resources, 677 S.W.2d\n667 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1984, no writ). In that case, the court, after holding that a contempt order, void because based on an\nambiguous support order, could not be taken as a conclusive adjudication of the arrearage in a subsequent action to reduce the\narrearage to judgment, remanded the case for a determination of the amount of the child support arrearage not ruled out by the\nambiguity. In Marichal v. Marichal, 768 S.W.2d 383 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1989, writ denied), the child support\nprovision was not based on the agreement of the parties and the decree failed to order the obligor to pay any child support. In\nTemplet v. Templet, 728 S.W.2d 844 (Tex.App.—Beaumont 1987, no writ), in an opinion lacking any factual recitation on the\nage of the children and whether or not the child support order was based on the agreement of the parties, it was held that an\nambiguous, indefinite and uncertain order would not support a judgment for child support arrearages and furthermore, that the\nobligor was no longer under any obligation to continue the support payments, presumably because the youngest of two children\nhad reached the age of eighteen years.\n\nIn his second point, Appellant contends that the provision for automatic increase in child support is unenforceable, citing as\nauthority In the Interest of J.M. and G.M., 585 S.W.2d 854 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1979, no writ), and Doss v. Doss,\n521 S.W.2d 709 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1975, no writ). While a court may not arbitrarily impose automatic or\nformula increases in child support, if the parties agree on an automatic increase in child support upon the happening of a certain\nevent and the court has found that the *552 agreement is in the best interest of the child, the parties may be ordered to perform\nin accordance with that agreement and upon their failure to do so, the child support order as set forth in the decree may be\nenforced by all available remedies, including contempt. Doss, 521 S.W.2d at 713. Tex.Fam.Code Ann. sec. 14.06 (Vernon\n1986). In the instant case, the parties had agreed in writing to provisions for child support and the court had found the agreement\nto be in the child's best interest. Appellant does not now claim, nor did he present any evidence in the trial court, that the child\nsupport order did not reflect the agreement of the parties. Point of Error No. Two is overruled.\n\n [3] In Appellant's final point of error, he challenges the judgment for past due child support as not meeting the requirements\nof Tex.Fam.Code Ann. sec. 14.33(a) (Vernon Supp.1990). That section in part states:\n\n             (a) Contents. An enforcement order shall contain findings setting out in ordinary and concise language the\n             provisions of the final order, decree, or judgment for which enforcement was sought, the acts or omissions\n             that are the subject of the order, the manner of noncompliance, and the relief awarded by the Court.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the court on the record made its order, which we conclude was in sufficient detail to comply\nwith Section 14.33(a). The trial judge said:\n\n  The Court finds that a judgment in the amount of $3,500 is hereby had against Mr. Thomas Cisneros, III in favor of Mrs.\n  Elva Cisneros for the ordered payments of $50 per month commencing February 1st of '83 through February 15th of '89; and\n  in accordance with the divorce decree ... through the Harris County Probation Department, Child Support Division at 1115\n  Congress in Houston, Texas. Judgment is here now had in the amount of $3,500 for which let execution issue. Each party\n  will pay their own costs of Court and attorney fees incurred in this cause.\n\nThe attorney for Appellant was in effect ordered to prepare the judgment, presumably in accordance with the court's oral order.\nHad she done so, the judgment in our opinion would have sufficiently met the requirements of Section 14.33(a). All of the cases\ncited by Appellant in support of his third point involved contempt and commitment situations, which admittedly and obviously\nrequire more specificity as to acts or omissions leading to the contempt than would a judgment for unpaid support. Under\nTex.R.App.P. 81 (formerly Tex.R.Civ.P. 434), the normal course on this point would be to reform the judgment to conform to\nthe judge's oral order and then affirm the judgment as reformed.\n\nHowever, such action is not indicated since the judgment may be affirmed for another reason. After its preparation, the judgment\nwas then approved not only as to form (a usual and harmless procedure), but as to substance as well by the attorneys representing\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Approval as to form is a matter of professional courtesy not necessary to a valid judgment. Such approval (as to\nform) does not waive any error in the proceedings or incident to the judgment itself. Sandoval v. Rattikin, 395 S.W.2d 889\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1965, writ ref'd n.r.e.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 901, 87 S.Ct. 199, 17 L.Ed.2d 132 (1966); 4\nR. McDonald, Texas Civil Practice sec. 17.09.4 (Rev.1984). But approval as to substance is something else. Approval of the\nsubstance of a judgment is tantamount to an agreement by the signatory that the judgment meets all of its essential requirements.\nBy Appellant's approval of the substance of the judgment, we hold that Appellant has waived any error in the judgment not\ncomplying with the requirements of Section 14.33(a). Point of Error No. Three is accordingly overruled.\n\nJudgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                    © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

No. 1, 220 S.W.3d 537 (2006)\n\n\nIn order to explain our analysis, we provide a chronology of the lawsuit, including two substantial periods of inactivity.\n\n\nJune 1996 Claxtons seek injunction against District.\n\n11/4/1996 (Upper) Lake Fork, as third party plaintiffs, add Billy and Barbara Lynn as third party defendants.\n\n3/26/1997 Claxtons add the Lynns as defendants.\n\n6/19/1997 Claxtons seek summary judgment against all defendants.\n\n6/18/2002 Claxtons file motion for partial summary judgment.\n\n7/12/2002 Judgment signed. Court grants partial summary judgment, Claxtons nonsuit all claims against Lynns, and all other\nclaims against District, and District nonsuits all third party claims against the Lynns. Decretal language in judgment specifically\nrenders judgment on all of the above and states that the judgment is final, that this is the final judgment, and that all relief not\nexpressly granted is denied. The judgment is signed as “approved as to form and substance” by counsel for Claxtons and District.\n\n9/6/2002 Judgment filemarked.\n\n10/3/2002 District files motion for new trial.\n\n11/15/2002 Order filed granting new trial.\n\n8/22/2005 Claxtons again nonsuit Lynns.\n\n9/1/2005 Claxtons file second motion for partial summary judgment against District, essentially same as original motion.\n\n3/24/2006 District files motion for summary judgment.\n\n3/27/2006 Claxtons file third motion for partial summary judgment against District, essentially the same as first and second\nmotions.\n\n7/19/2006 Final judgment signed.\n\n  1) Claxtons' third motion for partial summary judgment denied.\n\n   2) District's motion for summary judgment granted.\n [1] [2] The question confronting us is jurisdiction. The failure of a jurisdictional requirement deprives a court of the power\nto act (other than to determine that it has no jurisdiction). Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. at Dallas v. Loutzenhiser, 140 S.W.3d\n351, 359 (Tex.2004). And once a court determines that it has no jurisdiction, its only legitimate choice is to dismiss. State of\nTex. v. Morales, 869 S.W.2d 941, 949 (Tex.1994).\n\nThe judgment containing a signature date of July 12, 2002, disposes of all claims and parties in this lawsuit, and not only states\nthat it is the final judgment, but was approved both as to form and substance by counsel for the two remaining parties. It appears,\nfrom its face, that it was therefore final on that date. All of the relevant timetables begin to run on the date that a judgment is\nsigned. A motion for new trial must be filed within thirty days of that date. TEX.R. CIV. P. 329b. The date on which a notice\nof appeal must be filed is also calculated based on the date on which the judgment is signed. TEX.R.APP. P. 26.1.\n\n *541 [3] If the July 12, 2002, judgment was the final judgment in this case, as it says it is, then we must determine whether\nthe case was timely appealed with reference to that date. Using that date, only one result is possible—the notice of appeal filed\nSeptember 18, 2006, was untimely and could not establish our jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

No. 1, 220 S.W.3d 537 (2006)\n\n\nWe contacted the parties in connection with this issue, and have received briefing setting out their positions. Essentially, the\nClaxtons agree that the 2002 judgment is final, and now ask us to dismiss their appeal for want of jurisdiction.\n\nThe District takes the position that we should disregard the notation on the judgment as to the date it was signed, because it\nwas actually signed on the date it was ultimately filed. The extensive record provided contains nothing to support that position,\nother than the District's pleadings. The trial court's order granting the District's motion for new trial states that the prior agreed\njudgment “entered on September 6, 2002 (but bearing the erroneous date of July 12, 2002) should be, and it is hereby in all\nthings, vacated and set aside.”\n\n [4] Even if the trial court had the jurisdiction to grant the motion for new trial—which on its face it did not—and assuming\nthat some error exists in the face of a judgment signed as correct in form and substance by all counsel, and even if this were a\ndocument properly rendering a new judgment, it does not state the correct date on which the judgment was signed, and could\nnot be used by this Court to establish a signing date different from that on the face of the judgment. 1\n\nThe question of our jurisdiction to hear an appeal of this case then depends on the determination of which of the two signed\njudgments is the valid one. There can only be one final judgment. TEX.R. CIV. P. 301. A trial court retains plenary power to\ngrant a new trial or to vacate, modify, correct, or reform a judgment within thirty days after the judgment is signed. TEX.R.\nCIV. P. 329b(d); First Alief Bank v. White, 682 S.W.2d 251, 252 (Tex.1984). After the expiration of those thirty days, the trial\ncourt has no authority to set aside a judgment except by bill of review as provided by law. TEX.R. CIV. P. 329b(d); Thursby\nv. Stovall, 647 S.W.2d 953, 954 (Tex.1983).\n\n [5] [6] The trial court lost its plenary power to vacate the judgment August 11, 2002. The trial court therefore had no jurisdiction\nto enter the November 15, 2002, order granting a new trial some 126 days after the signing of the first judgment. State ex. rel.\nLatty v. Owens, 907 S.W.2d 484, 486 (Tex.1995). Judicial action taken after the court's jurisdiction over a cause has expired\nis a nullity. Id.\n\n [7] [8] Even if both parties agreed that a different date actually existed, we are constrained by the rules to determine our\njurisdiction by reference to the date on which the judgment was signed—a party cannot confer or waive jurisdiction by consent or\nagreement. Stine v. State, 908 S.W.2d 429 (Tex.Crim.App.1995). Appellate jurisdiction cannot be created by consent, stipulation\nof the parties, or waiver, either by the court or by litigants. Welder v. Fritz, 750 S.W.2d 930 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1988, no\nwrit). Jurisdiction is fundamental and cannot be ignored by this Court or waived by the parties. In re Marriage of Johnson, 595\nS.W.2d 900, 902 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1980, writ dism'd w.o.j.). Further, lack of appellate jurisdiction *542 is fundamental\nerror, which can be raised by the court sua sponte. New York Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Sanchez, 799 S.W.2d 677, 679 (Tex.1990).\n\nWe have no option in this case but to recognize the state of the record before us and to act accordingly.\n\nThe appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                                  OPINION ON REHEARING\n\nIn a protracted legal battle in Hopkins County pitting Ray and Carol Claxton against the (Upper) Lake Fork Water Control and\nImprovement District No. 1, the District first lost. A considerable time later, the trial court—after granting a new trial to the\nDistrict—ultimately changed course and found for the District.\n\nOur initial opinion dismissed the Claxtons' appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We based that dismissal on apparently jurisdictional\nfacts revealed by the appellate record, starting with the earlier judgment—against the District—which recited a signing date of\nJuly 12, 2002. We concluded then that the District's subsequently filed, and granted, motion for new trial had been filed too\nlate to give the trial court any power to grant it. The result of our ruling was that the later, and ultimate, trial court judgment\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                7\n\fClaxton v. (Upper) Lake Fork Water Control and Imp. Dist. No. 1, 220 S.W.3d 537 (2006)\n\n\n—dated July 19, 2006, and favoring the District—was without effect, since our ruling was that the 2002 judgment—favoring\nthe Claxtons—had become the final judgment. After our initial opinion was issued, the District obtained from the trial court\na January 16, 2007, judgment nunc pro tunc changing the signing date recited in the 2002 judgment from July 19, 2002, to\nSeptember 6, 2002. 2 If that nunc pro tunc change is effective, the District's 2002 motion for new trial was timely and therefore\nthe 2006 judgment favoring the District is the final judgment of the trial court. Because we reach just that result in this opinion,\nwe reinstate the appeal.\n\nIn its motion for rehearing, the District urges us to find valid the changes made by the nunc pro tunc judgment and thus recognize\nthe later trial court judgment favoring the District. In their response, the Claxtons argue that, for a few reasons, we should\ndisregard the nunc pro tunc judgment and recognize the 2002 judgment as the final judgment of the trial court. We disagree\nbecause (1) the 2002 judgment's originally recited date of signing was a clerical error, (2) the originally recited signing date is\nnot binding as part of any agreement of the parties, and (3) the date change is supported by the record.\n\n\n(1) The 2002 Judgment's Originally Recited Judgment Date Was a Clerical Error\n [9] The Claxtons assert that the nunc pro tunc date change was substantive or judicial in nature, and was thus not authorized.\nWe conclude otherwise.\n\n [10] Clerical mistakes in a judgment may be corrected by the judge in open court, and judgment nunc pro tunc rendered by\nthe trial court, according to the truth or justice of the case. TEX.R. CIV. P. 316. This may be done even after the expiration\nof the court's plenary power. TEX.R. CIV. P. 329b(f). Judicial errors, however, may not be corrected after the expiration of a\ncourt's plenary jurisdiction. *543 Escobar v. Escobar, 711 S.W.2d 230, 231 (Tex.1986).\n\n [11] [12] A clerical error is an error which does not result from judicial reasoning or determination. Andrews v. Koch, 702\nS.W.2d 584, 585 (Tex.1986). A judicial error is one which occurs in the rendering, as opposed to the entering, of a judgment.\nEscobar, 711 S.W.2d at 231; Delaup v. Delaup, 917 S.W.2d 411, 413 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ).\n\n\nOne type of situation exists when a judgment is substantively incorrect because of a mistake of counsel. 3 In that situation, the\njudgment is not erroneous, it does not provide different relief from that requested or pronounced in open court—it is simply not\nthe relief anticipated by the parties. When such a mistake is made and memorialized accurately by the trial court, any change is\njudicial in nature. It may be a mistake, but it is not the result of a clerical error: thus, a nunc pro tunc judgment is not available.\n\nA different situation is presented where a written judgment is ultimately signed that differs from the terms of the judgment\nas pronounced by the court. 4 In that situation, a nunc pro tunc judgment is available, because the written judgment does not\ncomport with the prior rendering.\n\n [13] [14] This case presents a third nunc pro tunc situation. It is an error that does not substantively alter the relief provided\nby the judgment. A judgment nunc pro tunc may be issued to correct the recited signing date of an order if the original recited\ndate is shown to have been incorrect. See Traylor Bros., Inc. v. Garcia, 949 S.W.2d 368, 369 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1997, no\nwrit). Consistent with the definition of the term, however, an order nunc pro tunc may not be used to backdate the signing of a\nwritten order that was not in fact signed earlier. In re Taylor, 113 S.W.3d 385, 393 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, orig.\nproceeding); see Jauregui Partners, Ltd. v. Grubb & Ellis Commercial Real Estate Servs., 960 S.W.2d 334, 337 (Tex.App.-\nCorpus Christi 1997, writ denied). In other words, it cannot be used as a fiction to alter signing dates—it must reflect reality. 5\n\nIn the present case, after conducting a hearing and reviewing the contemporaneous documents, the trial court concluded the\nindicated date was incorrect. In its order, the trial court stated that it did not actually sign the judgment on that earlier date, but\nsigned it approximately two months later. 6\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

No. 1, 220 S.W.3d 537 (2006)\n\n\nAccordingly, for the preliminary purposes of determining our jurisdiction over this appeal, we conclude that the correction was\nclerical in nature and that the remedy of judgment nunc pro tunc was available. 7\n\n\n *544 (2) The Originally Recited Judgment Date Is Not Binding as Part of Any Agreement\n [15] The Claxtons argue that, because the July 2002 judgment was an agreed judgment, as shown by counsel's signature\nagreeing as to form and substance, the District could not now attack the judgment's terms, including the date of signature.\n\n [16] After its preparation, the judgment was then approved not only as to form (a usual and harmless procedure), but as\nto substance as well by the attorneys representing both parties. Approval as to form is a matter of professional courtesy not\nnecessary to a valid judgment. Approval as to form does not waive any error in the proceedings or incident to the judgment\nitself. Sandoval v. Rattikin, 395 S.W.2d 889 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1965, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Approval as to substance is\nsomething else. Approval of the substance of a judgment has been described as tantamount to an agreement by the signatory\nthat the judgment meets all of its essential requirements. Cisneros v. Cisneros, 787 S.W.2d 550, 552 (Tex.App.-El Paso 1990,\nno writ).\n\n [17] [18] An agreed judgment means essentially the same thing as a judgment by consent. A judgment by consent is a\njudgment in which the terms are settled and agreed to by the parties and which is entered of record by authorization of the trial\ncourt. Matthews v. Looney, 132 Tex. 313, 123 S.W.2d 871 (1939); Johnson v. Rancho Guadalupe, Inc., 789 S.W.2d 596, 603\n(Tex.App.-Texarkana 1990, writ denied).\n\nWhile the 2002 judgment may have been an agreed or consent judgment, we find no reason to conclude the recited date of\nsigning was actually a material part of any agreement of the parties. The best witness that the parties did not consider the\njudgment's recited signing date as material to their agreement is the uniform manner in which all parties overlooked the July\n2002 recited date until this Court pointed it out in 2006.\n\nAdditionally, the signing dates recited in judgments are intended to reflect reality, not some different agreement of the parties.\n“Judges, attorneys and clerks are directed to use their best efforts to cause all judgments ... to be reduced to writing and signed\nby the trial judge with the date of signing stated therein.” TEX.R. CIV. P. 306a(2). The rule contemplates that each judgment\nshould accurately reflect the date it was actually signed by the court; it does not seem to contemplate allowing parties to include\nan agreed date of signing into the terms of consent judgments.\n\nWe decline to treat the originally recited judgment signing date as part of any agreement of the parties.\n\n\n(3) The Date Change Is Supported by the Record\n [19] The Claxtons also argue that the nunc pro tunc judgment is unsupported by the record. They assert that the information\navailable to the trial court was insufficient to allow it to determine that the date of signing was erroneous.\n\n [20] For a judgment nunc pro tunc to be properly granted, the evidence must be clear and convincing that a clerical error\n *545 was made. Avila v. Lone Star Radiology, 183 S.W.3d 814, 821 (Tex.App.-Waco 2005, no pet.); Barton v. Gillespie,\n178 S.W.3d 121, 127 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.); In re Broussard, 112 S.W.3d 827, 833 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2003, orig. proceeding).\n\n [21] [22] [23] [24] That evidence may come from a number of sources, including oral testimony, written documents,\nprevious judgments, docket entries, or the trial judge's personal recollection. Riner v. Briargrove Park Prop. Owners, Inc., 976\nS.W.2d 680, 683 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ). Further, “if [the trial judge] corrects the judgment nunc pro\ntunc, a presumption arises that his personal recollection supports the finding of clerical error.” Pruet v. Coastal States Trading,\nInc., 715 S.W.2d 702, 705 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1986, no writ).

Tex. Dep't of Human Resources, 859 S.W.2d 482, 485 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1993, no writ). The trial judge's\nrecollection of facts has the dignity and force of evidence. Ft. Worth & D.C. Ry. Co. v. Roberts, 98 Tex. 42, 81 S.W. 25, 26\n(1904); Blum v. Neilson, 59 Tex. 378 (1883); Wood v. Paulus, 524 S.W.2d 749, 756 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1975, writ\nref'd n.r.e.).\n\n\n [25] Even though it is presumed that the trial judge's personal recollection supports the finding of a clerical error, 8 the\nrecord from the hearing on the motion for judgment nunc pro tunc may negate any such presumption through evidence to the\ncontrary. In re Fuselier, 56 S.W.3d 265, 268 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, orig. proceeding). This is consistent with the\nrequirements of Rule 316 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires that such clerical mistakes may “be corrected\nby the judge in open court according to the truth....” See TEX.R. CIV. P. 316. Though a fairly loose version of evidence is\nallowed, with cases relying on the judge's recollections and on the argument of counsel, nevertheless, that evidence must be\nsufficiently clear and convincing to allow the trial court to conclude that clerical error exists.\n\nIn this case, the record now contains a transcription of a brief hearing held January 17, 2007. At the hearing, the trial court\nreviewed the court's files and examined the transcript of the September 2002 hearing.\n\nThe trial court stated in its January 16, 2007, order that it decided to grant the judgment nunc pro tunc based on its review of\nthe “Court's official file (including the official transcript of the proceedings occurring on 09/06/02 in open court)....” 9\n\n\nThe District argues that the trial court's determination is supported by the record because the earlier date was logically absurd. 10\nIt bases this conclusion on several *546 factors. One is the obvious fact that no party treated the motion for new trial as being\nuntimely—even though, based on the stated date of signing, it clearly was. All parties simply continued filing pleadings as\nthough the motion for new trial was timely. As the District points out, no party resisted the 2002 motion for new trial based on\na lack of jurisdiction, and, before this Court reviewed the record and recognized the problem, this issue was never raised.\n\nCertainly, a party cannot confer or waive jurisdiction either by consent or agreement. Stine v. State, 908 S.W.2d 429 (Tex.1995).\nThe mere fact that the parties behaved as though the trial court retained jurisdiction over the case does not confer jurisdiction\nto the court. But the behavior by both counsel and trial court on such an absolutely basic concept supports a conclusion that\neveryone involved knew the 2002 judgment was not actually signed on the earlier date. The District argues that the sole\nexplanation for the behavior of all involved was clearly that the judgment was not signed until the later date. 11\n\nFoolish or perfunctory behavior by counsel or court is a staple of appeals. Although we would prefer to think that such errors\nwould not occur, they do. Counsel for the District has directed us to no specific portion of the reporter's record from the\nSeptember 2, 2002, hearing to support the argument that the evidence clearly supports the court's decision. Given the brevity of\nthe record, however, we have nonetheless reviewed the transcription of that hearing to see if it supports the court's ruling. It does.\n\n\n [26]     [27] The September hearing commenced with only one attorney present, representing the Lynns. 12 The court\nacknowledged that the District and the Claxtons had sent in an agreed order granting the motion for summary judgment. The\ntrial court then questioned the Lynns' counsel at length about any ability they might have to complain about the judgment in\nthe absence of any affirmative cross-pleadings against either the Claxtons or the District. The Lynns' counsel repeatedly asked\nthe court not to enter the order just because the two parties agreed to it. On page seven of the record, counsel stated,\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              10\n\fClaxton v.

On page twelve of the record, counsel stated, “I would like for the Court to know that by the order that's\n    submitted to you, if you sign it, you will be ordering....” (Emphasis added.) At the end of the hearing, the trial court stated\n    that it would grant the nonsuit and then “will enter the agreed order between the two remaining parties.” That dialogue *547\n   seems to demonstrate that the judgment was indeed signed in September, not July. 13\nIn the January 16, 2007, nunc pro tunc hearing, the trial court reviewed the transcription of the prior hearing, heard argument\nby counsel, and reviewed a letter dated September 3, 2002, that appears to be a transmittal letter accompanying a delivery of\nthe 2002 judgment to the trial court just before the September 6 hearing.\n\nThe trial court did not state either in writing or orally that it was relying on its personal recollection to determine that an error\nexisted, and the discussion between counsel and court at the hearing suggests to the contrary. In that situation, we will not\nconclusively presume that it was doing so, especially in light of the five-year delay between the judgment and the judgment\nnunc pro tunc. See Pruet, 715 S.W.2d 705; Thompson, 859 S.W.2d at 485.\n\nThe same judge was involved, however, and he determined that the error existed. It is reasonable to assume he recalled the\ncontext of the September 2002 hearing, at least once his recollection was refreshed in 2006. The language used in the 2002\nhearing is best understood as indicating that the proposed judgment had not been signed to that point. That conclusion is\nfurther supported by the transmittal letter reviewed by the court. There is factually and legally sufficient evidence to support\nthe rendition of the judgment nunc pro tunc.\n\nBecause the nunc pro tunc change in the recited judgment date was valid, the District's subsequent motion for new trial was\ntimely. Therefore, the subsequent, 2006, judgment was effective and became the final judgment of the trial court.\n\nWe grant the District's motion for rehearing and reinstate the appeal.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      An order nunc pro tunc, correcting only a true clerical error, may be granted by a trial court at any time, even after it has lost jurisdiction\n         over the case. America's Favorite Chicken v. Galvan, 897 S.W.2d 874 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1995, writ denied).\n2        The new judgment, at its beginning, states that the motion for summary judgment came on for hearing September 6, 2002—a date\n         contrary to the notation originally made on the trial court docket—and contains a corrected signature date of September 6, 2002.\n         Except for those details, the nunc pro tunc judgment is a complete duplicate of the prior judgment, including the original typographical\n         errors. It was filed with the district clerk January 16, 2007.\n3        Dikeman v. Snell, 490 S.W.2d 183, 185–86 (Tex.1973).\n4        See Andrews, 702 S.W.2d at 585; Delaup, 917 S.W.2d 411; Petroleum Corp. v. First Nat'l Bank, 622 S.W.2d 152 (Tex.App.-Fort\n         Worth 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n5        Typical clerical changes to judgments that have been upheld include corrections of the date of judgment, Nolan v. Bettis, 562 S.W.2d\n         520, 523 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1978, no writ), correction of a party name, Carlyle Real Estate Ltd. Partnership–X v. Leibman, 782\n         S.W.2d 230, 233 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ), and correction of a numerical error, Escobar, 711 S.W.2d at 232.\n6        “Dates contained in judgments have been held on many occasions to be the type of errors that are correctable by judgment nunc\n         pro tunc.” Ortiz v. O.J. Beck & Sons, Inc., 611 S.W.2d 860, 863 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1980, no writ); see Traylor Bros.,\n         Inc., 949 S.W.2d at 369.\n7        The Claxtons assert that there were also judicial changes in the 2002 judgment. Certainly, a judgment nunc pro tunc may alter\n         nothing other than clerical matters. But, even if the corrected 2002 judgment differs from the original one in judicial matters, any\n         such differences are irrelevant at this stage. The 2002 judgment was entirely superseded by the 2006 judgment, if the 2006 judgment\n         was effective to do so. The only currently relevant part of the 2002 judgment is the date it was signed. That date determines whether\n         the 2006 judgment was effective.\n\n\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This argument is circular. The “impossibility” is based on the assumption that the later date\n      is correct, which is the issue the District is trying to prove by showing impossibility.\n11    The alternative, according to the District's brief, was that this is the only rational explanation for what would otherwise be\n      “outrageously irresponsible (if not downright dumb) behavior by both the Trial Court and the parties' counsel. .... in completely\n      ignoring the procedural provisions of Rule 329b.”\n12    The Lynns were defendants in the case, but all claims against them were disposed of by nonsuit, as reflected in the judgment.\n13    A potential problem with this evidence lies in the fact that “entering” a judgment and “signing” a judgment are by no means\n      synonymous concepts. We also recognize that the terms are unfortunately often loosely used by attorneys and judges. A judgment\n      routinely goes through three stages: (1) rendition, (2) signing, and (3) entry. Gen. Elec. Capital Auto Fin. Leasing Servs., Inc. v.\n      Stanfield, 71 S.W.3d 351, 354 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2001, pet. denied); In re Wilburn, 18 S.W.3d 837, 840 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2000, pet.\n      denied); Oak Creek Homes, Inc. v. Jones, 758 S.W.2d 288, 290 (Tex.App.-Waco 1988, no writ). The judgment becomes effective\n      once it is “rendered.” Stanfield, 71 S.W.3d at 354; Wilburn, 18 S.W.3d at 840. A judgment is “rendered” when the matter submitted to\n      it for adjudication is officially announced either orally in open court or by memorandum filed with the clerk. Samples Exterminators\n      v. Samples, 640 S.W.2d 873, 875 (Tex.1982); Wilburn, 18 S.W.3d at 840.\n          In this case, we conclude that, although the language was inaccurately used, court and counsel were actually discussing “signing”\n          rather than “entering” the judgment. So taken, the transcription supports the court's ultimate conclusion that it signed the judgment\n          on the later date.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

City of Mesquite, 594 S.W.2d 831 (1980)\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\nHUMPHREYS, Justice.\n\nThis is an appeal from an order denying declaratory relief to appellant, D. C. Cleere. Cleere petitioned the court to declare that a\n1974 order requiring him to remove automobile parts from his premises is not an injunction and that it is null and void because\nit does not meet the requirements of Tex.R.Civ.P. 683. We affirm.\n\nThe order here resulted from an action in 1974 by the City of Mesquite, to enjoin Cleere from operating an automobile repair\ngarage, selling automobile parts, and operating a wrecking yard on his premises. The 1974 order was an agreed order, prohibiting\nappellant from storing at his residence automobiles and automobile parts. In 1979, the city filed a contempt proceeding against\nCleere, alleging a violation of this order. Cleere counter-claimed for a declaration pursuant to Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2524-1\n(Vernon 1965) that the order was not a valid injunction. The court found that he was not in contempt, but that the agreed order\nwas “in force and effect as a permanent injunction.”\n\n [1] Cleere argues that the court erred in refusing to review the 1974 order under the Declaratory Judgment Act, which allows\nan interested person to have his rights construed under a written contract, and that the court erred in finding the agreed order\nwas a permanent injunction. We conclude that the court had no power to review its previous order. Any attack on the injunction\nin this proceeding is a collateral attack and cannot succeed unless the injunction is void. The court may determine, however,\nwhether the order is a valid permanent injunction. The question then is whether the court's finding that this is a valid permanent\ninjunction was error.\n\nThe agreed order decrees as follows:\n\n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Defendant is to remove all junk automobile cars,\n  transmissions and junk automobile parts from his premises; that the Defendant is not to allow said automobiles on his property\n  for a period longer than 24 hours, nor is he to store for commercial purposes any automobile transmissions or other junk\n  automobile parts; that if said parts or transmissions are stored for personal use, they must be stored in a building on Defendant's\n  property.\n\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that there will be no work on automobiles on Defendant's\n  premises located at 1123 Peachtree Road, Mesquite, Texas, except for work on the automobiles of Defendant's immediate\n  family, no unloading of automobile parts and transmissions except for the personal use of the Defendant and his immediate\n  family, and shall not allow impact wrenches or other noisy equipment to be used on his property after 10:00 o'clock p. m.\n\nCleere argues that this order is not a valid injunction because it does not explicitly use the words “restrain” or “enjoin” with\nrespect to the activities prohibited. We do not agree. Admittedly the restraining language *833 is unusual, but its intent to\nimpose a permanent restraint is evident.\n\n [2] Cleere also complains that the order does not comply with Tex.R.Civ.P. 683. That rule requires every order granting an\ninjunction to set forth the reasons for its issuance, be specific in terms and describe the acts sought to be restrained in detail.\nCleere contends that this order sets forth no reasons for its issuance and is not specific in its terms. Although the reasons are\nnot specified in the order, this defect does not invalidate the injunction under the circumstances shown here. The purpose of\nthe requirement for reasons is to inform the violator of why he is enjoined. Board of Equalization of City of Plano v. Wells,\n473 S.W.2d 88, 91 (Tex.Civ.App. Dallas 1971, no writ). When a party agrees to an injunction, he is in no position to complain\nthat he was not informed of the reasons.\n\nFurthermore, we hold that the order is sufficiently definite in its terms to apprise Cleere of the acts he can and cannot undertake.\nThe only indefiniteness suggested by appellant is that he cannot tell from the order what is commercial use and what is personal\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because of this disagreement, the trial judge intervened and appointed an arbitrator to preside over their\ndispute. CMH Homes filed an interlocutory appeal challenging this appointment, requesting in the alternative that its appeal\nbe treated as a mandamus petition. The court of appeals determined it was without jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal. We\nagree with the court of appeals' determination that Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.016 does not allow\nan interlocutory appeal of an order appointing an arbitrator. However, under these circumstances, CMH Homes's appeal may\nproperly be considered as a petition for writ of mandamus. We remand for the court of appeals to consider this appeal as a\npetition for writ of mandamus.\n\n\n\n                                                        I. Background\n\n\n                                                   A. Facts and Procedure\n\nOn October 2, 2002, Adam Perez purchased a manufactured home from CMH Homes, with the help of salesman Bruce Robinson\nMoore Jr. Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance provided financing for the purchase. The retail installment contract between CMH\nHomes and Perez contained an arbitration clause which provides:\n\n            All disputes, claims or controversies arising from or relating to this contract ... shall be resolved by\n            mandatory binding arbitration by one arbitrator selected by Seller with Buyer's consent.\n\n\n *447 On November 2, 2009, Perez sued CMH Homes, Inc., Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc., and Bruce Robinson Moore\nJr. (hereinafter “CMH Homes”) for fraud and violations of the Texas Debt Collection Act in the financing of his manufactured\nhome. Perez filed a motion to compel arbitration on January 13, 2010. Although the parties agreed that the contract was governed\nby the Federal Arbitration Act and agreed to submit to arbitration, they could not agree to an arbitrator. After two months of\ndisagreement, with both parties suggesting arbitrators in various correspondence, Perez's attorney declared an impasse. 1 On\nMarch 8, 2010, after a hearing, the trial court issued an order appointing Gilberto Hinojosa as arbitrator. Although the order\nwas titled “Order on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration,” the only directive in the order was to name an arbitrator to\npreside over the dispute.\n\nCMH Homes filed an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.016, challenging the\ncourt's appointment of Gilberto Hinojosa as arbitrator. CMH Homes did not file a separate mandamus petition, but asked the\ncourt of appeals in the alternative to consider its appeal as a mandamus proceeding. See CMH Homes, Inc. v. Perez, 328 S.W.3d\n592, 594 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2010, pet. granted). The court of appeals determined that interlocutory appeal was unavailable\nunder Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.016 and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Id. at 593.\n\n\n\n                                           B. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1098\n\n [1] [2] This court has jurisdiction to determine whether the court of appeals correctly decided its jurisdiction. See Badiga\nv. Lopez, 274 S.W.3d 681, 682 n. 1 (Tex.2009) (citing Tex. Dep't of Crim. Justice v. Simons, 140 S.W.3d 338, 343 n. 13\n(Tex.2004)). We review the court of appeals' determination of its jurisdiction de novo. Villafani v. Trejo, 251 S.W.3d 466,\n467 (Tex.2008).\n\n [3]     [4] Unless a statute authorizes an interlocutory appeal, appellate courts generally only have jurisdiction over final\njudgments. See Lehmann v. Har–Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 195 (Tex.2001); see also Jack B. Anglin Co., Inc. v. Tipps, 842\nS.W.2d 266, 272 (Tex.1992) (“Interlocutory orders may be appealed only if permitted by statute.” (citations omitted)). We\nstrictly apply statutes granting interlocutory appeals because they are a narrow exception to the general rule that interlocutory\norders are not immediately appealable. See, e.g., Tex. A & M Univ. Sys. v. *448 Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d 835, 841 (Tex.2007);\nBally Total Fitness Corp. v. Jackson, 53 S.W.3d 352, 355 (Tex.2001) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                          II. Discussion\n\nFirst, we must determine whether the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\nsection 51.016 of an interlocutory appeal of an order appointing an arbitrator. If section 51.016 does not provide jurisdiction,\nwe then decide whether the court of appeals should have considered CMH Homes's interlocutory appeal as a petition for writ\nof mandamus.\n\n\n\n                                 A. Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 51.016\n\n [5] Prior to the Legislature's 2009 amendment to the Texas Arbitration Act (TAA), parties seeking to appeal an order\nrefusing to compel arbitration would commonly file two separate appellate proceedings. Under the TAA, a party could bring\nan interlocutory appeal of an order denying arbitration. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 171.098. Under the Federal\nArbitration Act (FAA), a party could only challenge an order denying arbitration by mandamus. Jack B. Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at\n271–72. As a result, parallel proceedings were the norm in Texas arbitration disputes where parties were unsure which arbitration\nact applied. Although “unnecessarily expensive and cumbersome,” such parallel proceedings were required. Id. at 272. Twice,\nthis Court requested that the Legislature “consider amending the Texas Act to permit interlocutory appeals of orders issued\npursuant to the Federal Act.” Id.; In re D. Wilson Constr. Co., 196 S.W.3d 774, 780 n. 4 (Tex.2006) (quoting Jack B. Anglin,\n842 S.W.2d at 272). In response, the Legislature added section 51.016 to the Civil Practice and Remedies Code in 2009. Act\nof May 27, 2009, 81st Leg., R. S., ch. 820, §§ 1, 3, 2009 Tex. Gen. Laws 2061 (codified at TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE\n§ 51.016). This is our first opportunity to construe the scope of the Legislature's remedial action.\n\n [6] Section 51.016 provides that a party may appeal a judgment or interlocutory order “under the same circumstances that\nan appeal from a federal district court's order or decision would be permitted by 9 U.S.C. Section 16.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM.CODE § 51.016. Section 16 of the FAA provides:\n\n  (a) An appeal may be taken from—\n\n     (1) an order—\n\n       (A) refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title,\n\n       (B) denying a petition under section 4 of this title to order arbitration to proceed,\n\n       (C) denying an application under section 206 of this title to compel arbitration,\n\n       (D) confirming or denying confirmation of an award or partial award, or\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1098\n\n\n       (E) modifying, correcting, or vacating an award;\n\n     (2) an interlocutory order granting, continuing, or modifying an injunction against an arbitration that is subject to this\n        title; or\n\n     (3) a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.\n\n  (b) Except as otherwise provided in section 1292(b) of title 28, an appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order—\n\n     (1) granting a stay of any action under section 3 of this title;\n\n     (2) directing arbitration to proceed under section 4 of this title;\n\n      *449 (3) compelling arbitration under section 206 of this title; or\n\n     (4) refusing to enjoin an arbitration that is subject to this title.\n\n9 U.S.C. § 16. Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.016 expressly incorporates federal law. Thus, an interlocutory\nappeal in this case is permitted only if it would be permitted under the same circumstances in federal court under section 16.\nSee Little v. Tex. Dep't of Crim. Justice, 148 S.W.3d 374, 381–82 (Tex.2004) (examining federal law when interpreting state\nstatute that incorporated federal statute).\nIn considering the scope of section 16's jurisdictional grant, we first determine the nature of the order being appealed. The order\nat issue is entitled “Order on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration” and appoints Gilberto Hinojosa as arbitrator. Although\nPerez's motion to compel arbitration did not request that the trial court appoint an arbitrator, Perez submitted letters to the court\nadministrator declaring an impasse and requesting the trial judge appoint an arbitrator.\n\nAt first glance, this order may appear to fit within section 16(b)(2) as an order “directing arbitration to proceed.” 9 U.S.C. §\n16(b)(2). The “Order on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration” was issued in response to Perez's motion requesting that the\ntrial court compel arbitration. But the substance of the order is the appointment of Gilberto Hinojosa as arbitrator. See Del Valle\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Lopez, 845 S.W.2d 808, 809 (Tex.1992) (“[I]t is the character and function of an order that determine its\nclassification.”). While it may be argued that by appointing an arbitrator the order implicitly compels the parties to arbitration,\nthe order does not explicitly grant Perez's motion to compel and does not explicitly compel the parties to arbitrate their dispute.\nThere is no question that both parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute; the open question remaining was who would serve as\nthe arbitrator. The purpose of the order was to answer that question.\n\nSection 5 of the FAA explicitly permits a trial court to appoint an arbitrator under certain circumstances. 9 U.S.C. § 5. Where\nthe parties have previously agreed to a method for selecting an arbitrator, the parties must follow that method. Id. However,\nif the agreed upon method breaks down and there is a lapse in appointing an arbitrator, the parties may petition the trial court\nto appoint an arbitrator. Id.\n\n [7] An order appointing an arbitrator under section 5 is neither listed in section 16(a) (where appeals may be taken) nor in\nsection 16(b) (where appeals may not be taken). 9 U.S.C. § 16(a), (b). Even though section 16 is silent on the matter, CMH\nHomes argues that an appeal of an order appointing an arbitrator is “permitted by Section 16” because some federal circuit\ncases may have entertained interlocutory appeals regarding appointment of arbitrators pursuant to section 5. 2 However, none\nof the cited cases mentions whether the appeal is interlocutory and all but one of the cited cases fails to specifically discuss\nits jurisdictional basis or cite section 16. 3 Nat'l Am. Ins. Co. v. Transamerica *450 Occidental Life Ins. Co., 328 F.3d 462\n(8th Cir.2003) (affirming the district court's selection of an arbitrator pursuant to section 5); ACEquip Ltd. v. Am. Eng'g Corp.,\n315 F.3d 151 (2d Cir.2003) (same); see also The Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. LLC v. United Food & Commercial Workers\nUnion Local 342, 246 Fed.Appx. 7 (2d Cir.2007) (same). The one exception, Universal Reinsurance, specifically establishes\nits jurisdiction “pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(3), which authorizes review of ‘a final decision with respect to an arbitration....’\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Allstate Ins. Co., 16 F.3d 125, 126 (7th Cir.1994). Neither CMH Homes nor Perez has\nsuggested that this appeal was anything other than interlocutory. Because the trial court did not enter a dismissal or otherwise\ndispose of all parties and claims, the order remains interlocutory and cannot be appealed under section 16(a)(3). 4 See In re Gulf\nExploration, LLC, 289 S.W.3d 836, 839 (Tex.2009) ( “[T]here can be an appeal if the underlying case is dismissed.” (citing\nGreen Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 86–87, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000))). Although we presume\na court always evaluates its jurisdiction before deciding a matter, these cases do not indicate whether their jurisdictional basis\nwas section 16, and if so, whether the basis was section 16(a)(3) for final orders. 5 The only federal circuit case that speaks\ndirectly to the jurisdictional issue is O.P.C. Farms Inc. v. Conopco Inc., which held that under section 16, the trial court's order\nappointing an arbitrator was not a final decision and was thus unappealable. 6 *451 154 F.3d 1047, 1048–49 (9th Cir.1998).\nThe court explained: “[T]he only basis for an appeal ... that could even be plausibly argued is § 16(a)(3). It is, however, clear\nthat the appointment of the third arbitrator is not the final decision in this case.... Consequently § 16 effectively deprives us\nof jurisdiction.” Id.\n\nThe appellate jurisdiction of Texas courts in this case is based on federal law. The court of appeals had jurisdiction to consider the\ntrial court's order if “appeal ... would be permitted by 9 U.S.C. Section 16” in federal court. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE\n§ 51.016. Because there is no apparent federal approach to judicial review under section 16 of orders appointing arbitrators,\nwe will not extrapolate jurisdiction from a dearth of federal authority to allow an interlocutory appeal where the law is unclear\nand section 16 suggests otherwise.\n\nBefore the enactment of section 51.016, we specifically invited the Legislature “ ‘[i]n the interests of promoting the policy\nconsiderations of rigorous and expedited enforcement of arbitration agreements, ... to consider amending the Texas Act to\npermit interlocutory appeals of orders issued pursuant to the Federal Act.’ ” See In re D. Wilson, 196 S.W.3d at 780 n. 4\n(quoting Jack B. Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at 272). While we agree the Legislature added section 51.016 to prevent unnecessary\nparallel proceedings, this inconsistency generally arose when parties were unsure whether the TAA or the FAA applied to their\nagreement. See Jack B. Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at 272 (“[L]itigants who allege entitlement to arbitration under the Federal Act, and\nin the alternative, under the Texas Act, are burdened with the need to pursue parallel proceedings—an interlocutory appeal of\nthe trial court's denial under the Texas Act, and a writ of mandamus from the denial under the Federal Act.”). The Legislature in\nenacting section 51.016 has remedied this particular situation and enacted a policy change that promotes efficiency and common\nsense. See Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, LLP v. J.A. Green Dev. Corp., 327 S.W.3d 859, 862 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2010, no pet.);\nRanchers & Farmers Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stahlecker, No. 09–10–00286–CV, 2010 WL 4354020, at *1 (Tex.App.-Beaumont Nov.\n4, 2010, no pet.)

Just as all\ninterlocutory arbitration orders are not subject to appeal under the TAA, the Legislature in enacting section 51.016 did not\nintend to make all interlocutory orders under the FAA appealable, only those permitted by section 16 of the FAA. 7 Our\ninterpretation does not promote parallel proceedings of arbitration orders under the TAA and FAA and does not frustrate *452\nthe Legislature's intent in enacting section 51.016.\n\nThe court of appeals below correctly determined it was without jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal pursuant to section\n51.016. The only remaining appellate option for the parties at this juncture is mandamus relief.\n\n\n\n                                                           B.

Perez, 340 S.W.3d 444 (2011)\n54 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1098\n\n [9] Because Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.016 does not allow an interlocutory appeal of this type of order,\nCMH Homes requests in the alternative that we instruct the court of appeals to treat CMH Homes's appeal as a petition for writ\nof mandamus to prevent form from overriding substance.\n\nBefore the adoption of section 51.016, this Court held in In re Louisiana Pacific Corp. that a trial court's order appointing an\narbitrator could be reviewed by mandamus. 972 S.W.2d 63, 64 (Tex.1998) (per curiam). The arbitration agreement in Louisiana\nPacific allowed each party to select an arbitrator. Id. at 63. After Louisiana Pacific withdrew its arbitrator due to the objection\nof the other party, the trial court improperly appointed an arbitrator pursuant to section 5 of the FAA. Id. at 64. We conditionally\nissued the writ “[b]ecause the terms of the contract and the FAA allow[ed] Louisiana Pacific to choose an arbitrator” before\nthe trial court intervened to name a replacement. Id. We explained the importance of contractual arbitrator selection: “Since\nits inception, one of the central purposes of the FAA has been to allow the parties to select their own arbitration panel if they\nchoose to do so. ‘Toward this end, it is desirable that the arbitration panel consist of arbitrators chosen by each of the parties.’\n” Id. at 65 (quoting Lobo & Co. v. Plymouth Navigation Co., 187 F.Supp. 859, 860 (S.D.N.Y.1960)).\n\n [10] Although this court decided Louisiana Pacific when FAA interlocutory orders could only be reviewed by mandamus,\nthe Legislature's addition of section 51.016 is of no effect here. As explained above, section 51.016 does not provide for\ninterlocutory appeal of an order appointing an arbitrator. There is still no remedy by appeal because the FAA does not provide\nfor the review of this type of order in state court. See id. at 65 (“Louisiana Pacific has no adequate remedy by appeal because\nthe FAA does not provide for review of the trial court's actions in state court.”). Moreover, “[m]andamus is proper to correct\na clear abuse of discretion when there is no adequate remedy by appeal, as when a party is erroneously denied its contracted-\nfor arbitration rights under the FAA.” In re D. Wilson, 196 S.W.3d at 780 (internal citation omitted); see also Jack B. Anglin,\n842 S.W.2d at 272–73 (awarding mandamus relief where a party “would be deprived of the benefits of the arbitration clause it\ncontracted for, and the purpose of providing a rapid, inexpensive alternative to traditional litigation would be defeated”).\n\nPerez argues mandamus review is inappropriate because CMH Homes failed to file a separate mandamus petition and, citing\nJack B. Anglin, contends that the court “may not enlarge [its] appellate jurisdiction absent legislative mandate.” 842 S.W.2d\nat 272. However, CMH Homes invoked the court of appeals' original jurisdiction by specifically requesting that its appeal be\ntreated as a mandamus petition. See Warwick Towers Council of Co-Owners v. Park Warwick, L.P., 244 S.W.3d 838, 839\n(Tex.2008) (“[T]he factor which determines whether jurisdiction has been conferred on the appellate court is not the form or\nsubstance of the bond, certificate or affidavit, but whether the instrument was filed in a bona fide attempt to invoke *453\nappellate court jurisdiction.” (internal quotations and citations omitted)); see also Linwood v. NCNB Tex., 885 S.W.2d 102, 103\n(Tex.1994) (“The court of appeals ... has jurisdiction over the appeal if a party files an instrument in a bona fide attempt to\ninvoke the appellate court's jurisdiction.”); Grand Prairie Indep. Sch. Dist. v. S. Parts Imps., 813 S.W.2d 499, 500 (Tex.1991)\n( “If the appellant timely files a document in a bona fide attempt to invoke the appellate court's jurisdiction, the court of appeals,\non appellant's motion, must allow the appellant an opportunity to amend or refile the instrument required by law or our Rules\nto perfect the appeal.”).\n\n [11] Texas policy as “ ‘embodied in our appellate rules ... disfavors disposing of appeals based upon harmless procedural\ndefects.’ ” Higgins v. Randall Cnty. Sherif's Office, 257 S.W.3d 684, 688 (Tex.2008) (quoting Verburgt v. Dorner, 959 S.W.2d\n615, 616 (Tex.1997)); see also TEX.R.APP. P. 44.3 (“A court of appeals must not affirm or reverse a judgment or dismiss an\nappeal for formal defects or irregularities in appellate procedure without allowing a reasonable time to correct or amend the\ndefects or irregularities.”). This Court has previously treated a petition for review as a petition for writ of mandamus where the\nappellant/relator specifically sought mandamus relief. Powell v. Stover, 165 S.W.3d 322, 324 n. 1 (Tex.2005). And it is our\npractice when confronted with parallel mandamus and appeal proceedings “to consolidate the two proceedings and render a\ndecision disposing of both simultaneously.” In re Valero Energy Corp., 968 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex.1998).\n\n [12] [13] [14] [15] Moreover, nothing in the procedures for interlocutory appeals and mandamus actions prevents us from\ntreating this appeal as a petition for writ of mandamus. Appeals from interlocutory orders are accelerated, and an accelerated\nappeal is perfected by filing a notice of appeal within twenty days of the order. See TEX.R.APP. P. 26.1(b).

In re Int'l Profit Assocs., Inc., 274 S.W.3d 672, 676 (Tex.2009) (citations omitted). An appeal complying\nwith the rules governing an accelerated appeal would generally be timely for mandamus purposes. Additionally, briefs in\nmandamus actions and interlocutory appeals have the same content and page length requirements. Compare TEX.R.APP.

P. 52.3, .6\n(stating contents of brief and page length requirement for original proceedings at the supreme court and courts of appeals).\n“[T]he interests of promoting the policy considerations of rigorous and expedited enforcement of arbitration agreements” would\nnot be served by letting a technicality rule the day. 8 Jack B. Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at 272.\n\nWe will not unnecessarily waste the parties' time and further judicial resources by requiring CMH Homes to file a separate\ndocument with the title “petition for writ of mandamus” listed on the cover where the party has expressly requested mandamus\ntreatment of its appeal in an uncertain legal environment. See Wagner & Brown, Ltd. v. Horwood, 53 S.W.3d 347, 351\n(Tex.2001) (rejecting an “approach [that] catapults form over substance to deny appellate review on the merits”). *454 Because\nCMH Homes specifically requested mandamus relief in the court of appeals and preserved that issue in this Court, and because\njudicial efficiency militates against requiring CMH Homes to file a separate original proceeding, we instruct the court of appeals\nto consider this appeal as a petition for writ of mandamus. Today, we speak only to the propriety of mandamus review and not\nto the propriety of mandamus relief in this particular case. Because the merits were not briefed to this Court, we do not decide\nwhether the trial judge improperly appointed an arbitrator.\n\n\n\n                                                              III. Conclusion\n\nWe hold that Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.016 does not permit interlocutory appeal from an order\nappointing an arbitrator. However, this appeal may properly be considered as a petition for writ of mandamus, as CMH Homes\nrequested. The court of appeals erred in dismissing CMH Homes's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we reverse and\nremand to the court of appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n54 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1098\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      After receiving Perez's motion to compel arbitration, CMH Homes presented three names for consideration as potential arbitrators.\n        Perez rejected the suggested arbitrators and presented CMH Homes with a proposed agreed order that compelled the parties to\n        arbitration and left a blank for the court to appoint an arbitrator. CMH Homes did not agree to the proposed order and offered to submit\n        two more arbitrator names for Perez's consideration. Instead, Perez sent a copy of the proposed order to the court and suggested three\n        possible arbitrators for the court to appoint. In response, CMH Homes sent a letter to the court explaining that under the arbitration\n        provision, CMH Homes, not Perez, has the right to designate the arbitrator and suggested two more arbitrators. The letter also indicates\n        that the parties were considering one of the two arbitrators, Donato Ramos, but Perez was concerned about conflicts of interests\n        because his attorneys had financial connections to Ramos. The court held a hearing on February 9, 2010 where the parties appeared\n        to agree to the appointment of Ramos. However, when the parties could not agree to a waiver of conflicts for Ramos, the agreement\n        fell apart. Perez notified the court that they could not reach an agreed waiver and again asked the court to appoint an arbitrator and\n        re-submitted the three names previously suggested, including Gilberto Hinojosa.\n2       CMH Homes relies upon the following cases: Nat'l Am.

J. 1098\n\n4      In state court, cases are typically stayed pending arbitration rather than dismissed, as frequently is the case in federal court. In In\n       re Gulf Exploration, LLC, we explained:\n             Arbitrability is often the only issue in federal court because nondiverse parties may prevent removal of the underlying case from\n             state court; in such cases, even a stay order will be considered final if the federal action is effectively over. But in the state courts,\n             disputes about arbitrability and the merits must usually proceed in a single court under rules of dominant jurisdiction.\n             Accordingly, a stay is generally the only appropriate order for a state court with jurisdiction of all issues. Indeed, the Texas\n             Arbitration Act states that “[a]n order compelling arbitration must include a stay” of the underlying litigation. During arbitration,\n             a court order may be needed to replace an arbitrator, compel attendance of witnesses, or direct arbitrators to proceed promptly;\n             after arbitration, a court order is needed to confirm, modify, or vacate the arbitration award. Consequently, dismissal would\n             usually be inappropriate because the trial court cannot dispose of all claims and all parties until arbitration is completed.\n          289 S.W.3d 836, 840–41 (Tex.2009) (citations omitted).\n5      The appellants in National American and ACEquip represented to the circuit courts that the order being appealed was final. See\n       Appellant's Brief at 3, ACEquip Ltd. v. Am. Eng'g Corp., 315 F.3d 151 (2d Cir.2003); Appellant's Brief at 1, Nat'l Am. Ins. Co. v.\n       Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., 328 F.3d 462 (8th Cir.2003). The appellees did not challenge this assertion in ACEquip, see\n       Brief of Plaintiff–Appellee, ACEquip Ltd. v. Am. Eng'g Corp., 315 F.3d 151 (2d Cir.2003), and appear not to have challenged the\n       assertion in National American, see Reply Brief of Appellant, Nat'l Am. Ins. Co. v. Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., 328 F.3d\n       462 (8th Cir.2003). In both cases, the parties treated the order appointing an arbitrator as final, and the courts of appeals appear to\n       have taken the parties at their word.\n6      In its analysis, the court in O.P.C. Farms concluded that an order appointing an arbitrator is “embedded” in the case. O.P.C. Farms\n       Inc. v. Conopco Inc., 154 F.3d 1047, 1049 (9th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). However, the United States Supreme Court eliminated\n       the distinction between embedded and independent proceedings in Green Tree, which may raise questions about the precedential\n       value of this case. See Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 87–89, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000).\n7      The language of section 51.016, and therefore FAA section 16, also indicates the Legislature did not intend to create a comprehensive\n       appellate scheme making all FAA orders appealable through interlocutory appeal, but instead focused on denials of arbitration. See\n       TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 51.016; 9 U.S.C. § 16; In re Gulf Exploration, 289 S.W.3d at 839 (“[T]he FAA ‘generally\n       permits immediate appeal of orders hostile to arbitration ... but bars appeal of interlocutory orders favorable to arbitration.’ ” (quoting\n       Green Tree, 531 U.S. at 86, 121 S.Ct. 513)); see also May v. Higbee Co., 372 F.3d 757, 762 (5th Cir.2004) (noting the “general,\n       congressionally mandated rule that anti-arbitration decisions are immediately appealable under § 16(a)(1)”).\n8      Although we note that CMH Homes's petition was not certified at this Court as required by Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.3(j),\n       we are confident that CMH Homes will fully comply with Rule 52 on remand to the court of appeals.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 620\n\n\nAttorneys and Law Firms\n\n *833 Linda A. Acevedo, Chief Disciplinary Counsel, Cynthia W. Hamilton, Senior Appellate Disciplinary Counsel, Office\nof the Chief Disc. Counsel, for Commission for Lawyer Discipline.\n\nHeather Ann Badgett Schaefer, Plano, for Appellee.\n\nOpinion\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\nDistrict Grievance Committees appoint evidentiary panels for attorney disciplinary actions, and quorums of the evidentiary\npanels hear and decide the actions. This case raises the question of whether a properly constituted quorum of an improperly\nconstituted evidentiary panel has the authority to act in an attorney disciplinary matter. Following a unanimous finding of\nmisconduct by an evidentiary panel quorum, an attorney appealed the panel's order of disbarment to the Board of Disciplinary\nAppeals (BODA) on the ground that the evidentiary panel was not composed of the required ratio of public to attorney members.\n\nThe attorney failed to attend her hearing and filed no post-judgment motions with the evidentiary panel. BODA vacated the\npanel's judgment and remanded for a new hearing because the evidentiary panel was improperly composed, even though\nthe quorum of panelists present for the hearing met the required ratio of lawyers to non-lawyers. BODA concluded the\npanel-composition error voided the panel's judgment for lack of capacity. We agree with BODA that the composition of\nevidentiary panels, a mandatory requirement, was not met here. However, we conclude that requirement is not jurisdictional\nand the evidentiary panel's order was voidable, not void. Therefore, because no objection was lodged to the evidentiary panel's\ncomposition, we reverse BODA's judgment.\n\nComplaints of attorney misconduct are assessed by the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel (CDC) of the State Bar of\nTexas, which administers the attorney disciplinary system at the investigatory and trial levels. TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P.\n1.06(C), 5.01, .02. CDC investigates complaints to determine whether there is just cause that an attorney committed professional\nmisconduct. Id. at 1.06(U) & (V), 2.12, 5.02(C). Upon a determination of just cause by CDC, the accused attorney may have\nher case heard in (1) district court, upon election, with or without a jury or (2) in an administrative proceeding by an evidentiary\npanel of a State Bar of Texas District Grievance Committee (Grievance Committee) within the relevant geographic district. Id.\nat 2.14, .15. The respondent attorney must be notified of the names and addresses of the evidentiary panel members assigned\nto adjudicate the complaint. Id. at 2.06.\n\nGrievance Committees “must consist of no fewer than nine members,” id. at 2.02, and “shall act through panels,” as assigned\nby the Grievance Committee chairs. Id. at 2.07. “No panel may consist of more than one-half of all members of the [Grievance]\nCommittee or fewer than three members.” Id. The evidentiary panel hears evidence and adjudicates the grievance against an\nattorney accused of professional misconduct. Id. at 2.17. A quorum consists of “a majority of the membership of the panel,” id.\nat 2.07, and also must have “at least one public member for every two attorney members present.” Id.; see also In re Allison,\n288 S.W.3d 413, 417 (Tex.2009).\n\nIn these administrative proceedings, the Commission for Lawyer Discipline (Commission), a permanent committee of the State\nBar, is the litigant opposing the accused *834 attorney. Id. at 4.01, .06(A). The Commission is the client of the CDC in\ncomplaint proceedings not dismissed at summary disposition. Id. at 2.14(A), 5.02(G).\n\n [1] All panels of a Grievance Committee “must be composed of two-thirds attorneys and one-third public members.” Id.\nat 2.02; see also id. at 2.07 (specifying that panels “must be composed of two attorney members for each public member.”).\nRule 2.17 repeats this standard specifically for evidentiary panels: “Each Evidentiary Panel must have a ratio of two attorney\nmembers for every public member....” Id. at 2.17. The rules therefore clearly, and repeatedly, mandate a two-to-one ratio of\nattorneys to public members on evidentiary panels.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 620\n\n\nCDC investigated three grievances filed against attorney Heather Schaefer and found just cause to have the grievances\nadjudicated. See TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P. 5.02(C), (G), (I) & (M) (laying out in relevant part the duties of the CDC in\ndisciplinary proceedings). As Schaefer did not elect to have the grievances heard in district court, CDC assigned them to\nan evidentiary panel. Id. at 2.14, .15. The Chair of the relevant Grievance Committee, District 01A (Collin County, Texas),\nappointed a six-person evidentiary panel to hear the case. Schaefer filed an eve-of-trial “emergency continuance” on the basis\nof work conflicts, which the evidentiary panel denied. Schaefer did not attend her hearing. At the hearing in Schaefer's absence,\na quorum of evidentiary panel members unanimously found that Schaefer committed misconduct, and disbarred her in its\njudgment.\n\nAlthough the pre-hearing notices Schaefer received from the CDC showed a properly constituted evidentiary panel, the panel's\n“Evidentiary Hearing Report” (hearing report), summarizing basic information about the hearing, including the identity of the\npanelists present, listed the second public-member position on the six-person panel as “vacant.” The hearing was held February\n20, 2009; the hearing report was sent to Schaefer on March 2, 2009; and the evidentiary panel's judgment was signed on March\n3, 2009. The hearing report indicated that a quorum of four panel members, three attorneys and one public member, were\nactually present to hear Schaefer's case. Schaefer did not object to the panel's composition at the hearing or subsequently in any\npost-judgment motion. See TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.22 (describing post-judgment motions).\n\nSchaefer appealed to BODA, challenging the evidentiary panel's composition. On appeal, BODA vacated the disbarment\njudgment and remanded for a new hearing, in part on the basis that the evidentiary panel did not have the capacity to act\nbecause the panel was improperly composed. 1 BODA found that the evidentiary panel lacked the appropriate ratio of attorney\nmembers to public members and, reasoning that such error was fundamental, concluded that evidentiary panels not satisfying\nthis requirement lack capacity to act as a court. Schaefer v. Comm'n for Lawyer Discipline of the State Bar of Tex., Bd. of\nDisciplinary Appeals Case No. 44292 (Jan. 28, 2011) at 8, 14. The Commission appealed to this Court, challenging BODA's\ninterpretation of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure governing evidentiary-panel composition. We issued a *835\nsummary affirmance of BODA's judgment and later granted the Commission's motion for rehearing.\n\n [2] Appeals from determinations of BODA are generally reviewed under a substantial evidence standard. TEX.R.\nDISCIPLINARY P. 7.11. Because the issue before us involves the interpretation of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure,\nwe review BODA's legal conclusions on the construction of the rules de novo. See In re Caballero, 272 S.W.3d 595, 599\n(Tex.2008) (citing O'Quinn v. State Bar of Tex., 763 S.W.2d 397, 399 (Tex.1988) (observing that “our disciplinary rules should\nbe treated like statutes”)); MCI Sales & Serv., Inc. v. Hinton, 329 S.W.3d 475, 500 (Tex.2010) (noting that a “question of\nstatutory construction is a legal one which we review de novo”).\n\nIn In re Allison we recently addressed the public- and attorney-member ratio requirements in disciplinary hearings. 288 S.W.3d\n413 at 415–17. In Allison, which focused on the quorum requirements of Rule 2.07, the evidentiary panel was properly\nconstituted with four attorney members and two public members, but the quorum hearing Allison's case consisted of three\nattorneys and one public member. Id. at 414. Under the wording of 2.07, different from 2.02 and 2.17, we held that the quorum\nthat heard the disciplinary action satisfied the ratio requirement that it “ ‘include one public member for each two attorney\nmembers.’ ” Id. at 417 (quoting TEX. GOV'T CODE § 81.072(j)); see also TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.07. Schaefer's case\nis different from Allison in that the evidentiary panel from which the quorum was drawn included only one public member and\nfour attorney members, although the quorum satisfied Allison 's three-attorney-to-one-public-member ratio under 2.07. See 288\nS.W.3d at 417. Schaefer challenges the composition of the evidentiary panel.\n\n [3] [4] As observed above, “[e]ach Evidentiary Panel must have a ratio of two attorney members for every public member....”\nTEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.17; see also 2.02 (requiring two-thirds of Grievance Committees be attorneys and one-third be\npublic members). This is compulsory language. One of the two public-member positions on the six-member evidentiary panel\nwas vacant. The evidentiary panel's composition therefore violated the ratio requirement of one public member for each two\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 620\n\nattorney members. With four attorney members on the evidentiary panel, two public members would be required. Allison, 288\nS.W.3d at 417. In Allison, we explained:\n\n             [T]he factor-of-two rule applies only when there is an even number of attorneys. Thus, if there are four\n             attorney members (two sets of two) a quorum would require two public members.\n\nId. The evidentiary panel failed to meet this requirement. BODA and the Commission disagree over whether this improper panel\ncomposition deprived the evidentiary panel of capacity to act on the complaints, and consequently rendered the evidentiary\npanel's judgment void, or merely voidable.\n\nBODA concluded in its opinion that two of our precedents, Mapco, Inc. v. Forrest, 795 S.W.2d 700 (Tex.1990), and Tesco\nAmerican, Inc. v. Strong Industries, Inc., 221 S.W.3d 550 (Tex.2006), “affirm that, when a court rendering judgment has no\ncapacity to act as a court, the resulting judgment is void.” Schaefer, at 14. The Commission argues, however, that the Grievance\nCommittee's failure to abide by the panel composition requirements did not deprive the evidentiary panel of capacity, but merely\nrendered the judgment voidable. Because Schaefer, who was not present at the hearing, did not object to the composition of\nthe evidentiary panel or *836 file a post-judgment motion challenging its composition, the Commission also contends that\nany error was waived.\n\nWe construe the analogous precedents differently. Mapco concerned an appellate ruling in which one justice of a three-justice\npanel retired before an opinion was issued, resulting in a one-one opinion and judgment, a departure from both statutory and\nconstitutional provisions requiring a “majority” of a panel for a decision on a case. Mapco, 795 S.W.2d at 702–03. We declined\nto issue a general rule that a violation of a procedural rule, statute, or even a constitutional requirement rendered an appellate\njudgment “void.” Id. at 703. Instead, such violations generally only result in a “voidable” or erroneous judgment. Id. Describing\nthe “rare circumstances” that would void a judgment, we observed that “[a] judgment is void only when it is apparent that the\ncourt rendering the judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties, no jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the\njudgment, or no capacity to act as a court.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\nTesco concerned a judicial-disqualification challenge to a court of appeals decision. Tesco, 221 S.W.3d at 552–53. We held that\nthe justice authoring the unanimous opinion for the three-justice panel was disqualified due to an imputed conflict of interest. Id.\nat 554. We also noted that the orders or judgments of disqualified trial judges are void. Id. at 555 (citing In re Union Pac. Res.\nCo., 969 S.W.2d 427, 428 (Tex.1998); Buckholts Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Glaser, 632 S.W.2d 146, 148 (Tex.1982); Fry v. Tucker,\n146 Tex. 18, 202 S.W.2d 218, 221 (1947); Postal Mut. Indem. Co. v.

However, we held that,\nin the appellate context, where multiple judges are empaneled, a judgment is merely voidable unless every judge on the panel\nis disqualified. Id. at 555–56. We explained that, “ ‘[i]n general, as long as the court entering a judgment has jurisdiction of the\nparties and the subject matter and does not act outside its capacity as a court, the judgment is not void.’ ” Id. at 556 (quoting\nReiss v. Reiss, 118 S.W.3d 439, 443 (Tex.2003)). We concluded that the judgment at issue was not void as the appellate court\nhad “jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, jurisdiction to enter judgment, and capacity to act as a court.” Id.\n\nBODA's opinion distinguished Mapco and Tesco as involving appellate panels and analogized the evidentiary panel at issue\nhere to a trial court. Schaefer, at 14. For purposes of the applicable composition rules, the multi-member nature of an evidentiary\npanel makes it analogous to the appellate courts in Mapco and Tesco. Accordingly, the evidentiary panel's judgment was not\nvoid for lack of capacity. We therefore reverse BODA's judgment.\n\n [5] [6] [7] As the attorney-to-public-member composition requirement does not undermine the capacity of an evidentiary\npanel or otherwise deprive it of jurisdiction to hear evidence and issue disciplinary orders, error must be preserved by timely\nobjection. See TEX.R.APP. P. 33.1(a); cf. State Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp. v. Payne, 838 S.W.2d 235, 241 (Tex.1992)\n(error preservation generally requires that the party make the trial court aware of the complaint, timely and plainly, and\nobtain a ruling). BODA's opinion noted there is “some evidence” that Schaefer may not have been able to object to the\npanel's composition, even had she appeared at the hearing. Schaefer, at 10. BODA observed that “the [evidentiary panel] chair\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Id. The Grievance Committee should timely\nadvise respondent attorneys of the composition of the evidentiary panel from which the quorum was drawn to hear the case. But\ngenerally speaking, reasonable diligence by the attorney requires more than occurred here. Faced with an incomplete evidentiary\npanel, the respondent attorney must inquire as to panel composition and object if the composition requirements are not satisfied.\nShould an attorney fail to appear at an evidentiary hearing, she makes her task more difficult and should obtain the hearing\nreport and preserve error through a timely post-judgment motion. See TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.22.\n\n [8] The evidentiary panel's composition violated the requirements of Rules 2.07 and 2.17 of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary\nProcedure. That violation, however, did not deprive the evidentiary panel of its capacity to select a quorum, hear evidence,\nand issue a judgment. Therefore, in the absence of a timely objection, error was waived. Accordingly, without hearing oral\nargument, we reverse the Board of Disciplinary Appeals' judgment and reinstate the evidentiary panel's judgment of disbarment.\nSee TEX.R.

In September 2005, Darrell Haun acquired 51% of the shares\nof Solarcraft. Contemporaneously, the Conlins signed employment agreements with Solarcraft. The employment agreements\nincluded a non-compete provision that provided “[f]or 3 years following termination of employment, Employee agrees not\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Haun, 419 S.W.3d 682 (2013)\n37 IER Cases 488\n\nto, directly or indirectly, engage in any business which is competitive with the business of Solarcraft in the United States of\nAmerica.”\n\nIn February 2009, Haun and Solarcraft, Inc. (collectively, “Haun”) sued the Conlins, alleging they violated their non-compete\nagreements. Haun sought to enjoin the Conlins from competing with Solarcraft and from having access to Solarcraft facilities\nand information. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order as requested by Haun on February 2, 2009.\n\nOn February 19, 2009, the trial court heard Haun's application for a temporary injunction. However, before the trial court ruled\non the application, the parties informed it that they had reached an agreement regarding temporary injunctive relief. On February\n24, 2009, the trial court signed an order titled “Agreed Temporary Injunction,” which enjoined the Conlins from competing with\nSolarcraft in various ways, and enjoined Haun from tampering with Solarcraft records and data, including financial records.\nThe order stated that it was effective “until the trial of this cause, or further order of this Court.” It contained a blank in which\nthe trial setting date could be written, but the blank was not filled in.\n\nOn July 23, 2009, the Conlins moved to dissolve the temporary injunction. They contended that the injunction should be\ndissolved because (1) it was void under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 because it failed to state the reasons for its issuance\nand set a date for trial, and (2) Kathryn's three-year covenant not to compete had expired. The parties agree that the trial court\norally denied the motion on October 9, 2009, but the record contains no written order on this motion.\n\nMore than three years later, on February 27, 2013, the Conlins filed a second motion to dissolve the temporary injunction. The\nConlins argued, as they had in their 2009 motion to dissolve, that the agreed temporary injunction order was void under Texas\nRule of Civil Procedure 683 because it failed to state the reasons for its issuance and failed to set the case for trial. They also\nargued that changed circumstances warranted the dissolution of the temporary injunction. Specifically, the Conlins argued that\nbecause they were forcibly removed from Solarcraft on February 2, 2009, the three-year covenants not to compete expired, at\nthe latest, on February 2, 2012, and therefore there was no remaining basis for enjoining them from competing with Solarcraft.\nIn addition, the Conlins argued that they had sold all of their shares in Solarcraft to Haun on January 19, 2013, and they now\nheld no interests in Solarcraft. After a hearing on April 1, 2013, at which the trial court orally denied the Conlins' motion, the\ntrial court *685 signed a written order denying the motion to dissolve on April 15, 2013. The Conlins filed a notice of appeal\nfrom the trial court's denial of the motion on April 8, 2013.\n\n\n\n                                                            Discussion\n\nThe Conlins raise two issues on appeal. First, they argue that the agreed temporary injunction order is void for failure to state the\nreasons for its issuance or set the cause for trial, as required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683. Second, and alternatively,\nthey argue the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to modify or dissolve the temporary injunction because no basis for\nthe injunction remained after the Conlins' non-compete agreements expired and the Conlins sold their ownership interest in\nSolarcraft.\n\nHaun does not dispute that the temporary injunction order does not comply with the requirements of Rule 683. Instead, Haun\nargues that (1) we lack jurisdiction because the Conlins failed to appeal within 20 days after the trial court denied the Conlins'\nfirst motion to dissolve in 2009, and (2) the Conlins are estopped from challenging the temporary injunction order because they\nagreed to it. We address Haun's challenge to our jurisdiction before turning to the merits.\n\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n [1] Haun contends that the Conlins' appeal was untimely because their notice of appeal was not filed within 20 days of the date\nthe trial court denied their first motion to dissolve in 2009. He contends “[b]ecause they failed to timely appeal the denial of their\nfirst Motion To Dissolve Temporary Injunction in October of 2009, the Conlins waived any errors regarding compliance with\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Haun, 419 S.W.3d 682 (2013)\n37 IER Cases 488\n\nTRCP 683, as well as any other matters raised in this appeal that also existed at the time their first motion to vacate was denied.”\nBut Haun cites no authority—and we can find none—to support his contention that a party may appeal only from the denial\nof his first motion to dissolve an injunction. The cases Haun cites do not support that contention. They merely stand for the\nproposition that, when an appellate court reviews a trial court's order on a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction, it reviews\nthe trial court's decision to grant or deny the motion to dissolve, and not the trial court's original decision to grant a temporary\ninjunction. See BS & B Safety Sys., Inc. v. Fritts, No. 01–98–00957–CV, 1999 WL 447605, at *2 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.]\nJune 17, 1999, no pet.) (not designated for publication); Tober v. Turner of Tex., Inc., 668 S.W.2d 831, 834 (Tex.App.-Austin\n1984, no writ); Marshall v. Good Times, Inc., 537 S.W.2d 536, 538 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1976, writ dism'd).\n\nThe interlocutory appeal of an order denying a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction is an accelerated appeal, and\naccordingly, the notice of appeal must be filed within 20 days of the date of the order denying the motion. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n& REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(4) (West Supp.2013); TEX.R.APP. P. 26.1(b), 28.1(a). Here, the Conlins filed their notice\nof appeal on April 8, 2013, one week after the trial court orally denied the second motion and one week before the trial court\nsigned its order. The notice of appeal was timely filed, and accordingly, we have jurisdiction over the appeal. See TEX.R.APP.\nP. 27.1(a) (“In a civil case, a prematurely filed notice of appeal is effective and deemed filed on the day of, but after, the event\nthat begins the period for perfecting the appeal.”).\n\n\nB. Failure to Comply with Rule 683\n\n\n                                          1. Applicable Law and Standard of Review\n\n [2] Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 requires that an order granting a temporary *686 injunction state the reasons for its\nissuance and set the cause for trial on the merits. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 683; Qwest Commc'ns Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d\n334, 337 (Tex.2000). “These procedural requirements are mandatory, and an order granting a temporary injunction that does\nnot meet them is subject to being declared void and dissolved.” Qwest, 24 S.W.3d at 337; see InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A.\nv. Paz Constr. Co., 715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.1986) (stating that requirements of Rule 683 are mandatory and must be strictly\nfollowed); In re Corcoran, 343 S.W.3d 268, 269 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, orig. proceeding) (“Agreed Mutual\nTemporary Injunction” order was void because it did comply with Rule 683); In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d 268, 273 (Tex.App.-\nSan Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding) (temporary injunction order that does not comply with Rule 683 is void); Kaufmann v.\nMorales, 93 S.W.3d 650, 656 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (“This provision [in Rule 683] is mandatory; a\nfailure to include a trial setting is grounds for voiding the injunction.”).\n\n [3] [4] The trial court has broad discretion to grant or deny a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction. Tex. State Optical,\nInc. v. Wiggins, 882 S.W.2d 8, 11–12 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, no writ) (citing Cellular Mktg. v. Houston Cellular\nTel. Co., 784 S.W.2d 734, 735 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, no writ)). On appeal, our review is limited to the narrow\nquestion of whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to dissolve. Cellular Mktg., 784 S.W.2d at 735.\nA trial court abuses its discretion only if it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable that it amounts to a clear and\nprejudicial error of law or if it clearly fails to correctly analyze or apply the law. Intercontinental Terminals Co. v. Vopak N.\nAm., Inc., 354 S.W.3d 887, 892 (Tex.2011).\n\n\n\n                                                           2. Analysis\n\nHaun acknowledges that the temporary injunction order does not comply with Rule 683, but argues the Conlins are estopped\nfrom challenging it because they agreed to it. The San Antonio court of appeals considered a nearly identical argument in In\nre Garza, 126 S.W.3d 268 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding) and rejected it, holding that an agreed temporary\ninjunction order that does not comply with Rule 683 is “fatally defective and void” and that “a party who agrees to a void order\nhas agreed to nothing.” 126 S.W.3d at 271. Accordingly, the court held that the agreed temporary injunction order at issue in\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              4\n\fConlin v. Haun, 419 S.W.3d 682 (2013)\n37 IER Cases 488\n\nthat case was void. Id. at 273. In so holding, In re Garza explicitly rejected another case relied upon by Haun, Henke v. Peoples\nState Bank of Hallettsville, 6 S.W.3d 717 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.), which held that, while failure to\ncomply with Rule 683 was fundamental error, the fact that the appealing party had agreed to the order meant the party was\nestopped from challenging the order based on that error.\n\nHaun argues that In re Garza “fails to follow one Texas Supreme Court case and clearly misinterprets another case” and “is\nnot binding on this Court.” The first Texas Supreme Court case Haun references, Reiss v. Reiss, 118 S.W.3d 439 (Tex.2003),\ndid not address the validity of temporary injunction orders in any way. The In re Garza court specifically considered whether\nReiss controlled and concluded it did not. 126 S.W.3d at 273. The second Texas Supreme Court case, Qwest Commc'ns Corp.\nv. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334 (Tex.2000), held that a temporary injunction order that does not comply with the mandatory\nrequirements of Rule 683 is *687 “subject to being declared void and dissolved.” Id. at 337. Haun argues this means that the\nagreed order in this case is merely voidable, and not void, and that a party who has agreed to a voidable order may not attack\nthat order on appeal. The In re Garza court rejected this argument, holding that Qwest clearly stated that an order that failed\nto comply with Rule 683 was void. In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273.\n\n [5] Our sister court, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, has followed In re Garza and held that an “Agreed Mutual Temporary\nInjunction” order that did not comply with the mandatory requirements of Rule 683 was void and must be dissolved. See In re\nCorcoran, 343 S.W.3d at 269. We likewise find In re Garza persuasive and follow it and In re Corcoran here. Accordingly,\nthe Conlins are not estopped from complaining about the “Agreed Temporary Injunction” order's failure to comply with the\nmandatory requirements of Rule 683. Here, it is undisputed that the order does not set the case for trial. Accordingly, we\nconclude the Agreed Temporary Injunction must be dissolved. See Intercontinental Terminals Co., 354 S.W.3d at 892; Qwest,\n24 S.W.3d at 337; In re Corcoran, 343 S.W.3d at 269; In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273; Kaufmann, 93 S.W.3d at 656.\n\nWe sustain the Conlins' first issue. Because we have concluded that the temporary injunction order must be dissolved, we do\nnot reach the Conlins' second issue.\n\n\n\n                                                          Conclusion\n\nWe reverse the trial court's order denying the Conlins' motion to dissolve and remand with instructions to the trial court to\ndissolve the temporary injunction. All pending motions are denied as moot.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n37 IER Cases 488\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      See TEX. CIV.

Powell, 8 Tex. 80 (1852)\n\n\n\n\nThe ground taken by the defendants below and sustained by the court in dismissing the suit is, that the deed made by the minors\nis not void but only such as may be avoided by them on attaining their majority.\n\nBut the guardian, we contend, is not bound to sit down and see his wards stripped of their possessions by their own deeds; but he\nhas the right, and it is his duty, to take care of their estate, and account for rents and profits. Hence the right to control and avoid\nany of those acts which could dispossess them, and to sue for and recover their property; to eject trespassers, and do everything\nfor them which they could do to protect their own interests if they were of lawful age. The guardian is the legal representative\nof the infant. Clerke says, speaking of infants, “His acts are either void or voidable. This distinction is not conclusively settled,\nalthough the opinion of Lord Chief Justice Eyre is regarded with much satisfaction, that when the court could pronounce the\ncontract to be prejudicial to the infant, it was void; when beneficial, valid; when of dubious benefit or prejudice, voidable only\nat his election.” (Rudiments and Practice, p. 57.) According to this view of the case, when the infant, by his legal representative,\nelects to declare the deed void, will the court undertake to say, upon looking at the petition, that it is beneficial and valid? The\ncourt below, having high chancery jurisdiction, will protect the rights of infants, being their guardian. But we think by the law\nthe deed to Powell is void and not voidable. Story says, “And in respect to the acts of infants of a more solemn nature, such\nas deeds, gifts, and grants, this distinction *83 has been insisted on; that such as do take effect by delivery of his hand are\nvoidable; but such as do not so take effect are void.” (Eq. vol. 1, sec. 241; see authorities there cited, Zouch v. Parsons, 3 Burr.\nR., 1794; Perkins, sec. 12; 8 Am. Jurist, 327, et seq.) Nor is it necessary to aver specific fraud. The act itself is a fraud. (1 Story's\nEq., sec. 242.) So far as the opinion of the civilians is of weight, they are decided on the point. Grotius places a contract with\nan infant on the same footing with one made with a lunatic or an idiot. (De jure Belli. Grot., B. 2, ch. 11, sec. 5; so also the\nInstitute, Lib. 3, Tit. 20, secs. 8 and 10; Dig., Lib. 50, Tit. 17; Paudicts, B. 2, Tit. 38, p. 216, et seq.\n\nIn the different States many conflicting authorities are found. In Connecticut, unless the contracts have a semblance of advantage\nto the infant, they are void, (4 Day, 59; 6 Conn., 494;) North Carolina, (1 Hayw. R., 143; Hoyle v. Stowe, 2 Dev. & Batt. R.,\n320;) Maryland, (Fudge v. The State, 3 Gill. & Johns. R., 103; 11 Id., 314; Salmon v. Claggett, 3 Bland Ch. R., 125; (New\nYork, (Bool v. Mix, 17 Wend. R., 119;) but still the infant may enter and take profits; (Stafford v. Root, 9 Cowen, 626; Roof\nv. Stafford, 7 Id., 22,) decided both ways.\n\nAn infant's legal representatives can avoid a deed made by the former. (Roberts v. Wiggin, 1 N. H. R., 73. Clerke lays down\nthe same rule. (Rud. and Practice, 57.\n\nAll the books say there must be an affirmance; and the most of them say it must be express. (19 Wend. R., 301; 14 Johns. R., 124.)\n\nIn the case of Wheaton v. East, (5 Yerg. R., 41,) the doctrine is laid down that the contract is voidable. Yet the court heard all\nthe proof to show the consideration; that it was fair and full; that the minor wanted but a few months of his majority when he\nmade the contract, and did not bring his suit for nearly four years after the sale.\n\nThe petition, in asking that the deed to Powell be declared void, and that they be remitted to the possession of the premises,\n *84 asks nothing inconsistent with either view of the law. They aver in their petition that Powell fraudulently procured them\nto join with their brother William in the execution of the deed of the 15th May, 1846; that they were then, and still are, minors;\nthey aver no sale; no considerations; but charge that Powell fraudulently procured them to execute the deed.\n\nThe fact of their infancy is a badge of fraud. (1 Story's Eq., sec. 242, above cited.) The petition certainly shows sufficient on\nits face to authorize the court below to hear the proof. Whether the deed be void or voidable the guardian can avoid it. Can he\ndo it in any other way than by asking the court in behalf of his wards to set it aside? Or can he be justified in submitting to\nthe adverse possession of the defendants, and permitting them to reap the fruits and destroy the lands and timber till his wards\ncome of age? Suppose his wards were to call him to account for the way he had managed their estate, would he be excused\nby setting up this conveyance to Powell? The adoption of such a principle would release every guardian who chose to have\nhis ward's property wasted. (6 Rand. R., 556.)\n\nIf the guardian or his wards wished to disaffirm a sale made by his wards, a suit is conclusive evidence of that disaffirmance.\n(Sellars v. Davis, 4 Yerg. R., 506.)\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                   3\n\fCummings v. Powell, 8 Tex. 80 (1852)\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps there is not a case in the books where a guardian could be excused on such grounds. And the court below, sitting as a\ncourt of equity, if it would not avoid the deed of the minors, should at least have remitted them to the possession and given it to\nthe guardian for the debts of the minors for necessaries, for expenses of guardianship, &c. But if he is estopped by their deed,\na guardian is liable to be defrauded by a stranger's meddling with the estate of his wards, and has no remedy.\n\nHEMPHILL, CH. J.\n\nThe ground upon which the demurrer was supported below, and which has been urged, is that the *85 deed made by the minors\nwas not void, but voidable, and could be avoided by them only after attaining majority.\n\nWe will consider, in the first place, whether the deed be void or voidable. It is important to ascertain the exact signification of\nthese terms, as upon that depends the character of the act, and the rights, obligations, and liabilities of parties and of strangers to\nthe transaction. A void act, as defined in the latter cases and by approved authorities, is one which is entirely null, not binding\non either party, and not susceptible of ratification; and a voidable act is one which is obligatory upon others until disaffirmed\nby the party with whom it originated and which may be subsequently ratified or confirmed. Such is the import of these terms;\nbut on examining the earlier cases it will be found that they were frequently confounded. The term void was frequently used\nwhen it was intended to imply only that the act was not binding, or that its obligation might be avoided by the infants. (Bingham\non Infancy, p. 18.)\n\nAs questions growing out of the acts of minors, under our former laws, may and will arise, it may be well to remember that the\ndistinction between void and voidable, as recognized by the authorities at common law in relation to this special subject, is not\nknown to Spanish jurisprudence; at least a void act is not characterized by all of the same incidents.\n\nFor instance, one of the results of the nullity of an act of a minor at common law is stated to be its unsusceptibility of ratification.\n\nNo such consequence follows under the laws of Spain. If a sale, for instance, of a minor's real property be absolutely null for the\nwant of indispensable legal solemnities, it may, nevertheless, be either expressly or tacitly ratified. Whether the act be prima\nfacie good, the sale having been attended with all legal formalities, yet subject to avoidance on the ground of lesion, or whether\nit be absolutely null for the want of any of these formalities, is immaterial. In either case it becomes valid by the assent and\napprobation of the minor after attaining *86 adult age. (10 Mart. R., 276; Febrero, vol. 5, pp. 379-80.) The reason of the rule\nis very satisfactory. The privilege for avoiding for lesion, or of considering the contract void when nullities have intervened, is\nin either and in both cases for the benefit of the minor. His interests are consulted. The rule is designed for his protection, and\nconsequently he may waive or renounce his privilege when he deems it advantageous to his interest. (Febrero, vol. 5, p. 378.) It\nis a general principle of the Spanish law that any person who has the capacity to dispose of his property by contract, will, &c.,\nmay by his voluntary act renounce a present or future right. (Febrero, vol. 2, p. 248.) There are some exceptions to this rule; as,\nfor instance, the right to a future succession cannot be alienated, as this might induce schemes to compass the death of the present\nowner and affect the free exercise of his testamentary power. But, as a necessary result of the capacity conferred by law, a party\nmay renounce the privileges consequent upon the nullity of contracts or sales made by him during infancy. There are nullities,\nhowever, which cannot be cured by ratification, as in the instances above cited, or where the stipulations are in derogation of\ngood morals or public order or policy; but nullities for the benefit of individuals may be renounced and the contracts validated\nby their express or tacit confirmation. (3 Annual R., 328; Meares v. Robinson and Wife, decided at this term.)\n\nThese observations are made that there may be no misapprehension as to the force or precise meaning of the terms “void” or\n“null,” when used with reference to the acts of minors as affected by the laws of Spain, and the modification of that meaning\nwhen employed with reference to their acts under the common law.\n\nNotwithstanding the many attempts of the bench, the profession, and jurists to elucidate the subject, yet the questions as to what\nacts of minors shall be regarded as void and what voidable, and what the criterions by which the precise character of their acts\nshall be determined, remain involved in doubt and difficulty. *87 Some of their contracts, as for instance, for necessaries, are\nvalid, and consequently binding on both parties. So far everything is clear. There is no doubt about the standard of validity. But\nwhen these confines are passed, confusion, uncertainty, and conflict of opinion begin to prevail, and we are left in doubt, not\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Powell, 8 Tex. 80 (1852)\n\n\nonly as to what acts shall be regarded void and what voidable, but as to the grounds or tests by which they shall be adjudged\nthe one or the other.\n\nThe tendency of decisions, for a century at least, has been for the extension of the rule that the acts of infants shall be deemed\nvoidable only, and subject to their election either to affirm or disallow them. (2 Kent's Comm., 193.) Where a deed has been\ndelivered, its character of voidability has by some been placed on the ground of the solemnity of the instrument, and by others\nthat there is a semblance of benefit to the infant from the matter of the deed upon the face of it. In Zouch v. Parsons, 3 Burr,\n1794, these points were discussed, and though this case has been questioned as authority in England, yet its doctrines have\nbeen sanctioned in the various courts of the United States, and have received a more liberal extension in their decisions on the\nsubject-matter. In that case, in relation to the effect of the solemity of the instrument, the following rule from Perkins was cited\nwith approbation: “All such gifts, grants, or deeds made by infants, which do not take effect by delivery of his hand, are void;\nbut all gifts, grants, or deeds made by matter in deed, or in writing, which do take effect by delivery of his hand, are voidable\nby himself, his heirs, and by those who have his estate.” And the court says that the words “which take effect” are an essential\npart of the definition, and exclude letters of attorney or deeds which delegate a mere power and convey no interest; that there\nwas no difference between a feoffment and deeds which convey an interest, for the reason that the delivery of the deed must\nbe in the presence of the witnesses as much as the living assignee; the ceremony is as solemn; the presumption that the witness\nwould not attest, if they saw in him an infant, applies equally to both. *88 “Powers of attorney are an exception to the general\nrule that the deeds of infants are only voidable, and a power to receive seizure is an exception to that. The end of the privilege\nis to protect infants, and to that object all the rules and their exceptions must be directed.” But be the point as to the solemnity\nof the delivery as it may, (and there were respectable sayings the other way,) the court held that it was not necessary to their\ndetermination, for they were all of opinion that the consideration received and other circumstances of the transaction showed a\nsemblance of benefit to the infant sufficient to make it voidable only upon the matter of the conveyance.\n\nReeves, in his Treatise on Domestic Relation, expresses the rule in the following terms: “Purchases by an infant are voidable.\nConveyances are voidable only when they take effect by delivery; but if the infant's privilege will not be sufficiently protected\nby considering them as voidable, they are void. Executory contracts are all voidable only. There is no contract executed or\nexecutory but what is voidable only if the contract has taken effect by delivery, excepting cases of delegated powers.” (P. 254.)\n\nThis last position is questioned in 14 Mass., 462, and it was said that “no satisfactory reason can be assigned for the position\nthat a power of attorney, executed by an infant, was absolutely void, and that, perhaps, it might be assumed as a principle that\nall simple contracts by infants which are not founded on an illegal consideration are, strictly, not void, but only voidable. They\nremain a legal substratum for future assent, until avoided by the infant; and if, instead of avoiding, he confirm them when he\nhas a legal capacity to make a contract, they are, in all respects, like contracts by adults.”\n\nThe justness of the views presented in this opinion is very striking, and they apply with special force to the condition of property\nin this State. The lands of individuals are frequently situate in counties remote from each other and from the residence of the\nowner.\n\nIt is a matter of great convenience, if not of absolute necessity, *89 that sales should be effected by agents, and it seems quite\npreposterous that a sale by a minor, which must necessarily or may most conveniently be made through the intervention of an\nattorney in fact, should be void, but if made by himself would only be voidable. His infancy, instead of operating beneficially,\nwould, under such circumstances, be perverted to his injury. If the act be void, it is not binding on others; and if the property\ndepreciate after the sale, it might be thrown back upon his hands, and his infancy would then be turned against him, and, instead\nof shielding himself, would protect others.\n\nIt is impracticable, under the circumstances, to review all or many of the decisions on the question now under discussion. The\nsubject is still involved in obscurity. The test of the character of the act, as dependent upon manual delivery of the deed, has\nvery little foundation in reason. It can afford but a very flimsey protection, which is the object of the rule; and it is repudiated by\nBingham in his admirable treatise on Infancy, p. 10; and he refers to an instance of an act by an infant which does not take effect\nby delivery of his hand, but which is not void; and that is the case of a parol lease for years. Upon this the infant can recover\nfor rent in arrear, which he could not do if the act were void; and further, that this criterion comprehends only gifts, grants,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Powell, 8 Tex. 80 (1852)\n\n\nand deeds, and is not sufficiently extensive for general application. The remaining test, that there must be some semblance of\nbenefit to an infant, is apparently better adapted to the protection of the infant, and is better supported by the authorities.\n\nThe rule is expressed by Chief Justice Eyre, in Keane v. Boycott, (2 H. Bl. R.,) in the following terms: “When the court can\npronounce the contract to be to the infant's prejudice, it is void; and when to his benefit, as for necessaries, it is good; and when\nthe contract is of an uncertain nature, as to benefit or prejudice, it is voidable only, at the election of the infant.”\n\nThis is something better than the test arising from the solemnity *90 of the instrument. But there may be contracts which a\ncourt may deem prejudicial to the infant, but which he, for good reasons, may know to be otherwise. And in such case, if the act\nbe void, its benefits cannot be made available at his election. It is not binding on the other party, and he may refuse compliance\nwith its obligations. Perhaps it would be more consonant with sound policy to hold that none of the acts of an infant should be\ndeemed void on the mere technical ground of infancy alone, but that they should be held binding on others, and voidable at the\nelection of the infant, unless they be such as by the policy of the law are deemed and held to be valid.\n\nThis is apart from cases where actual fraud exists or advantage is taken of the minor's imbecility. In all such the contracts\nwould be void; and so they would be where the consideration was illegal, or against public policy, or incompatible with the\nconfidential relations existing between the minor and others.\n\nOn examination of the authorities, and with due regard to the object to be attained by the privilege of the infant, viz, his\nprotection, we are justified in concluding that any delivery of a deed or thing granted, which, if done by an adult, would pass the\ntitle, will, if done by an infant, render it voidable but not void; and that if the semblance of benefit be regarded as a criterion, the\nmore rational and consistent rule would be that the act should not be deemed void unless it was one of those which, as a general\nprinciple, it would be better for the infant that they should be deemed void than voidable. As to what contracts of infants are\nvoid and what voidable, see 4 Day R., 59; 6 Conn. R., 494; 1 Hayw. R., 143; 3 Gill & Johns. R., 314; 1 J. J. Marsh, R., 236; 5\nYerg. R., 41; 14 Mass. R., 462; 13 Id., 239; 7 Cow. R., 22; 9 Id., 126; 17 Wend. R., 119.\n\nIt is very clear, then, that this deed, having been delivered as deeds usually are delivered by adults, and having also a semblence\nof benefit on the face of it to the infant, must be *91 regarded as not void, but only voidable; and the question then arises\nwhether it can be avoided, by guardian or by themselves, before their attaining full age.\n\nUpon principle it would seem that if an act of an infant be only voidable and be binding upon the other party until it is avoided,\nthat the act of disaffirmance must be by the infant himself on attaining mature age. That it can be avoided at all is owing to\nthe want of legal discretion in the infant at the time of its execution; and this continues during his nonage, and renders his\naffirmance or disaffirmance before majority of no avail.\n\nIn Oliver & Clapp v. Howdlet, (13 Mass. R., 237,) it was said by the court that they knew of no position of law which gave\nthe guardian of the minor authority to disaffirm purchases made by the minors; that the sales had the semblance of benefit\nto the vendees, and that the authority of guardians extending only to such things as may be for the benefit and advantage of\ntheir wards, they could not avoid contracts from which they derive benefit, for this, being injurious to the infant, would be a\nviolation of the guardian's duty.\n\nThe question under consideration has been discussed and elaborately investigated in the courts of New York.\n\nIn Roof v. Stafford, (7 Cowen, 179,) which was an action of trover brought for the recovery of a horse sold by a minor, the\nplaintiff suing by guardian, the Supreme Court held that the contract was not voidable until the infant came of age. An extensive\nreview was taken of the authorities in relation to the time at which an infant can avoid a conveyance of his lands. In Zouch v.\nParsons (3 Burr. 1794,) it was said that an infant could not avoid such conveyance until arriving at twenty-one years of age.\nThis is said to follow, because, if it were otherwise, he might also bring a writ analogous to a dum fuit infra œtatem, and so\nconclude his right upon the record. Other books give the same reason, and say the matter should remain open until he comes\nof age and is legally capable of thinking over what he has done. (4 Cruise's Dig., 17 Deeds, § 12.) These *92 and other books\nadvance the doctrine in qualified terms, (Co. Lit., 302; 8 Taunt., 40, 41, 42; Com. Dig., ENFANT, (C. 4,) stating that the infant\nmay avoid when he comes of age.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Powell, 8 Tex. 80 (1852)\n\n\n\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court was reversed in the court of errors. (9 Cowen 628.) In the opinion given by the chancellor\nit is said, “the general rule is that an infant cannot avoid his contract executed by himself, and which is therefore voidable only\nwhile he is within age. He lacks legal discretion to do the act of avoidance. But this rule must be taken with the distinction\nthat it shall not work unavoidable prejudice to the infant, or the object of his privilege would not be answered. When applied\nto a sale of his property it must be to his land, a case in which he may enter and receive the profits until the power of finally\navoiding shall arrive.” The true rule was said to be that where the infant can enter and hold the subject of the sale till his legal\nage, he shall be incapable of avoiding till that time; but where the possession is changed, and there are no legal means to hold\nand regain it in the meantime, the infant, or his guardian for him, has the right to exercise the power of rescission immediately;\nthat the common law gave no action or other means by which the mere possession of personal property could be reclaimed\nand held subject to the right of avoidance.\n\nThe sum of the doctrines held by both courts in this case in relation to conveyances of lands by a minor is, that they cannot be\navoided until after the minor arrives at full age, though he may enter and take the profits in the meantime, but that the sale and\ndelivery of chattels by a minor may be avoided while under age.\n\nThe whole subject in relation to the character of the acts of infants, and the time and manner in which they may be avoided,\nwas thoroughly canvassed in the case of Bool v. Mix, 17 Wendell, 119, and it was said that the general rules vary; that the act\nin pais of an infant may be avoided by some other act of equal solemnity and notoriety. It may also be avoided by a writ of dum\nfuit infra œtatem; but that it cannot be *93 avoided until the infant becomes of age, though he may enter and take the profits;\nthat some of the old books say that an infant may avoid his deed by entry before he becomes of age, but such is not the doctrine\nof the present day. He may enter and take the profits until he has the legal capacity to affirm or disaffirm the deed, but the deed\nis not rendered void by the entry; it may still be confirmed after he arrives at full age.\n\nNo case has been cited in which an infant has, by himself or guardian, attempted, while within age, to recover lands passed from\nhim by an executed conveyance, and it is probable that none such can be shown; otherwise it would, doubtless, have been cited\nin support of the plaintiffs. It is very doubtful whether in cases of this character a formal demand, even if the infant had attained\nmajority, should not have been made for possession before the bringing of suit. The deed of the infant was only voidable, and\nuntil avoided the defendant is not a trespasser. His possession is rightful, and it would seem that he should have some notice\nof the intention to disaffirm the contract. But this point is left open.\n\nAnother ground which might have been taken in support of demurrer is this, that there was no offer on the part of the plaintiffs\nto restore the purchase-money which they had received from the defendant Powell on the sale. This is the rule under the laws\nof Spain, (vide Febrero, vol. 5, p. 379) and it has received the sanction of the courts of some of the States, eminent for their\nwisdom and authority. It is characterized by honesty, and enforces rectitude of conduct in transactions between individuals,\nand, as a general rule, it will be recognized and enforced by this court. See Reeve's Dom.

In three issues, West asserts that the district court erred by granting *515 the temporary injunction\nbecause the State did not demonstrate (1) a probable right to recovery or (2) a probable injury, and (3) the order did not\nspecifically state the reasons for its issuance. Because we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm the\nsupplemental temporary injunction order.\n\n\n\n                                                         BACKGROUND\n\nAt the supplemental temporary injunction hearing, the court admitted evidence of a printed copy of West's Web site, testimony\nfrom an investigator employed by the Consumer Protection and Public Health Division of the Texas Attorney General's office,\nand documents from Hibernia National Bank in Baton Rouge provided in response to the State's civil investigative demand. The\ninvestigator's testimony and the Web site evidence revealed that West used an Austin radio commercial, a recorded telephone\nmessage (identified as a “phone overview”), and a Web site to advertise meetings at a local hotel about a “banking opportunity”\nthat would allow any “U.S. Citizen” to pay off all personal debt—including “credit cards, mortgages, student loans, vehicles,\nloans, IRS settlements, and back child support”—before December 31, 2005, by securing a “loan” from an unnamed bank.\nWest's “www.bankopp.com ” Web site also stated that “David [West] found a Bank that is willing to give individuals loans to\npay off their debts. Then the Bank is willing to turn around and forgive that loan so it doesn't have to be paid off.” It asserted that\n“two little known banking practices ... Fractional Banking and Forgiven Loans” made this “one shot opportunity” possible. The\nsite claimed that although “this opportunity is legal,” the “Federal Reserve will undoubtedly close the loopholes that allowed the\nproject to take place this once. While the system intended on well connected, wealthy individuals to be able to take advantage\nof this, it was never intended that regular every day people would gain access to it.”\n\nThe site further claimed that the unnamed bank had agreed to pay off $100 million in debt and that “[the] project is about David\n[West]'s looking for others to add their debt to the pile David started.” The idea was to accumulate $100 million in debt for\nthe bank to “fractionalize then forgive” so that “the bank can make money and the folks with David can get out of debt.” The\nsite claimed that, after “David told his 10 closest friends about the project,” word spread quickly throughout Louisiana and\nMississippi. The site also explained that West accelerated its marketing of the project following Hurricane Katrina:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State, 212 S.W.3d 513 (2006)\n\n\n\n\n             After Hurricane Katrina hit the area he had been putting the word out in, David switched gears to Radio\n             advertising across the South and is now starting a hectic schedule of FREE open meetings in major\n             Southern Cities. These Open Meetings will have hundreds of people in attendance and are expected to\n             help reach[ ] the goal of $100 Million in debt before Thanksgiving. This would leave plenty of time for\n             the bank to pay before December 31st (the bank only needs 10 business days).\n\n\nAs a signal of their “commitment to be involved with the project,” the site asked participants to deposit a wire transfer of\n$5,000 to a bank account in Panama, or to the “Del Sur International Holdings” account with Hibernia National Bank in Baton\nRouge. According to the site, after the money was submitted, the bank would perform a financial analysis and might contact\nthe participant to discuss any issues: “[T]he bank will analyze each project member's debt and provide feedback if there are\nconcerns.” Also after wiring their $5,000 “commitment/deposit money,” the site stated that participants would receive *516\na document “guarantee[ing] that the loan that [they] are signing will be forgiven and that [they] will not have to pay it back!”\nVisitors to the Web site were not informed that the Del Sur International Holdings account, to which the $5,000 wire transfers\nwere directed, was the sole proprietorship of David West.\n\nThe State filed suit under the Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §§\n17.46(a)-(b), .47 (West Supp.2005) ( “DTPA”) against David West, Roxana Suadi West, 1 Carlos M. Suadi, and Pydia, Inc. d/b/\na www.bankopp.com, seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief based on the debt elimination “service for sale to consumers.”\nThe State obtained a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction against West, preventing any further marketing in\nTexas of the “banking opportunity.” 2\n\nAfter learning that David West attempted to withdraw all funds from the Baton Rouge account to which the participants' $5,000\nwire transfers had been directed, 3 the State obtained a supplemental restraining order, freezing the funds in the Hibernia\nbank account. The State also sought to convert the supplemental restraining order into a supplemental temporary injunction,\nmaintaining the freeze on the account. Following a hearing on October 25, 2005, the district court entered an order preventing\nDavid West, Roxana Suadi West, Carlos M. Suadi, and Pydia, Inc. d/b/a www.bankopp.com from accessing the Hibernia bank\naccount.\n\nSpecifically, the order enjoined them (and those associated with them) from\n\n  • transferring, spending, hypothecating, concealing, encumbering, withdrawing, removing or allowing the transfer, removal,\n     or withdrawal of any funds from Account # [ ], held at Hibernia National Bank; and\n\n  • transferring, spending, hypothecating, concealing, encumbering, withdrawing, removing or allowing the transfer, removal,\n     or withdrawal of any funds from any other financial institution and/or account into which Defendants have placed or caused\n     to be placed, funds from consumers to participate in Defendants' “bank opportunity.”\n\nThe order also set the case for trial.\n\nWest appeals only from the district court's October 25 supplemental temporary injunction order that froze the assets in the\nHibernia bank account. It asserts that the district court abused its discretion by entering the supplemental temporary injunction\nbecause the State did not demonstrate (1) a probable right to recovery or (2) a probable injury, and (3) the order did not\nspecifically state the reasons for its issuance. We consider each of these assertions.\n\n\n\n                                                        DISCUSSION\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                           4\n\fDavid Jason West and Pydia, Inc. v. State, 212 S.W.3d 513 (2006)\n\n\n [1] [2] [3] The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo of the litigation's subject matter pending\ntrial on the merits. Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex.2002). Because the decision to grant or deny a *517\ntemporary injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, we will not disturb that decision absent a clear abuse\nof discretion. Id. at 204. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, indulging every reasonable\ninference in its favor. Brammer v. K.B. Home Lone Star, L.P., 114 S.W.3d 101, 105–06 (Tex.App.-Austin 2003, no pet.). This\nCourt may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court unless its action was so arbitrary that it exceeded the bounds\nof reasonable discretion. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204. The trial court does not abuse its discretion if some evidence reasonably\nsupports its decision. Id. at 211.\n\n\nProbable right to recovery\n [4] In its first issue, West argues that the district court erred in granting the temporary injunction because the State did not\ndemonstrate a probable right to recovery. West asserts that the transaction at issue is a loan of money, which is neither a “good”\nnor a “service” under the DTPA. See Riverside Nat'l Bank v. Lewis, 603 S.W.2d 169, 174 (Tex.1980); see also Tex. Bus.\n& Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(1), (2) (West 2002). West argues that the DTPA applies to transactions in which the borrower's\nobjective is to purchase or lease goods or services, but the DTPA is inapplicable if a borrower's objective is merely an attempt\nto acquire money. See La Sara Grain Co. v. First Nat'l Bank of Mercedes, 673 S.W.2d 558, 566–67 (Tex.1984); Megason v.\nRed River Employees Fed. Credit Union, 868 S.W.2d 871, 872 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1993, no writ).\n\nThe State responds that West's “banking opportunity” is not a “loan” because it specifies that repayment is unnecessary. Cf.\nTex. Fin.Code Ann. § 301.002(a)(10) (West Supp.2005) (defining “loan” as “an advance of money that is made to or on behalf\nof an obligor, the principal amount of which the obligor has an obligation to pay the creditor”). Alternatively, the State argues\nthat West is offering a loan forgiveness service.\n\nThe district court's finding of a probable right to recovery under the DTPA is supported by the evidence that West's Web site,\noffers a service—specifically, the elimination of debt—in exchange for $5,000. According to the site, after the money was\nsubmitted, “the bank [would] analyze each project member's debt and provide feedback if there are concerns.” The site also\ninformed the public that, after wiring $5,000, participants would receive a document “guarantee [ing] that the loan that [they]\nare signing will be forgiven and that [they] will not have to pay it back!”\n\n“Services” are defined in the DTPA as “work, labor, or service purchased or leased for use, including services furnished in\nconnection with the sale or repair of goods.” Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(2). The State's suit complains that West's\nservice violates the DTPA because it (1) fails to disclose the factual basis for its representations that David West has found a\nbank willing to give individuals “loans” to pay their debts without expectation of repayment and (2) encourages consumers to\nwire $5,000 to an account that is not identified as belonging to David West.\n\nThe debt elimination opportunity that West offered is similar to the function of a “credit services organization,” defined in the\nfinance code as\n\n  a person who provides, or represents that the person can or will provide, for the payment of valuable consideration, any of\n  the following services with respect to the extension of consumer credit by others:\n\n  (A) improving a consumer's credit history or rating;\n\n  (B) obtaining an extension of consumer credit for a consumer; or\n\n   *518 (C) providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to Paragraph (A) or (B).\n\nTex. Fin.Code Ann. § 393.001 (West 1998). A credit services organization is prohibited from making false or misleading\nrepresentations in the offer or sale of its services, including any unfounded guarantees to “erase bad credit” or to obtain an\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State, 212 S.W.3d 513 (2006)\n\n\nextension of consumer credit “regardless of credit history.” Id. § 393.304 (West 1998). A violation of chapter 393 is actionable\nunder the DTPA. Id. § 393.504 (West 1998).\n\nOne company was held to have been a credit services organization based on its:\n\n  • television commercials “targeting consumers with debt problems and urging them to contact [the company] for relief from\n     these woes;”\n\n  • printed materials informing a debtor that it could assist in obtaining and repairing credit; and\n\n  • Web site, which stated that the company could provide advice or assistance to “empower debtors [to] make an informed\n    decision on how to manage, service or liquidate their debts.”\n\nIn re Zuniga, 332 B.R. 760, 786 (Bankr.S.D.Tex., 2005) (applying Texas law). These activities parallel West's “banking\nopportunity”—advertised on the radio, in a telephone message, and on the Web—offering debt elimination, for $5,000 as\nspecified on the Web site, to any “U.S. Citizen” for any type of debt through a “loan” that would not require repayment. The\nservice West promoted on its Web site included financial analysis, by which “the bank [would] analyze each project member's\ndebt and provide feedback if there are concerns.”\n\nWe conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the State demonstrated a probable right to\nrecovery under the DTPA. We overrule West's first issue.\n\n\nProbable injury\n [5] In its second issue, West argues that the district court erred in granting the temporary injunction because the State did not\ndemonstrate a probable injury prior to final trial on the merits. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204. Probable injury includes elements\nof imminent harm, irreparable harm, and lack of an adequate remedy at law. Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. Thompson, 24\nS.W.3d 570, 577 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, no pet.) (citing Surko Enters., Inc. v. Borg–Warner Acceptance Corp., 782 S.W.2d\n223, 225 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ)).\n\nWest argues that the State did not produce any competent evidence that money in the Hibernia bank account in Louisiana\nbelonged to any Texas consumer or that West would dissipate the funds from the account. The State contends that the common\nlaw requirements for a temporary injunction—including balancing of the equities, proof of irreparable harm or injury, and lack\nof an adequate remedy at law—are inapplicable when the State is seeking statutorily-authorized injunctive relief. See Tex. Bus.\n& Com.Code Ann. § 17.47(a). Section 17.47 of the DTPA states that\n\n             whenever the consumer protection division has reason to believe that any person is engaging in, has\n             engaged in, or is about to engage in any act or practice declared to be unlawful by this subchapter, and\n             that proceedings would be in the public interest, the division may bring an action in the name of the\n             state against the person to restrain by temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent\n             injunction the use of such method, act, or practice.\n\nId. The Texas Supreme Court has ruled that “when it is determined that [a] statute is being violated, it is within the province\nof the district court to restrain it.” State *519 v. Texas Pet Foods, Inc., 591 S.W.2d 800, 805 (Tex.1979) (affirming award of\npermanent injunctive relief based on threatened violation of environmental statutes). The court observed that the doctrine of\nbalancing the equities had no application to statutorily-authorized injunctive relief. Id.\n\nTexas courts have likewise held that when an applicant relies upon a statutory source for injunctive relief, such as the DTPA,\nthe statute's express language supersedes the common law injunctive relief elements such as imminent harm or irreparable\ninjury and lack of an adequate remedy at law.

(holding that when\nlegislature authorized attorney general to seek injunctions on behalf of multiple consumers, it determined that past or threatened\nDTPA violation coupled with public need constituted sufficient “irreparable risk of harm” to support entry of injunction).\n\n [6] Accordingly, the State argues that, to be entitled to a temporary injunction under the DTPA, it need only demonstrate to\nthe court its reason to believe that (1) any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in any act or practice\ndeclared to be unlawful by the DTPA, and (2) that proceedings would be in the public interest. See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code\nAnn. § 17.47(a). The fact that a person has ceased its unlawful conduct will not affect the State's entitlement to injunctive relief.\nId. Furthermore, the DTPA authorizes the court to “make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary to compensate\nidentifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by\nmeans of any unlawful act or practice.” Id. § 17.47(d) (emphasis added).\n\nAt the October 25 hearing on the supplemental temporary injunction, the State introduced evidence of West's\n“www.bankopp.com ” Web site, promoting a “banking opportunity” that would allow any “U.S. Citizen” to pay off all personal\ndebt—including “credit cards, mortgages, student loans, vehicles, loans, IRS settlements, and back child support”—before\nDecember 31, 2005, by securing a “loan” from an unnamed bank. The site contained repeated assertions that participants will not\nrepay the bank because the “loans” will be forgiven. It claimed that “two little known banking practices ... Fractional Banking\nand Forgiven Loans” made this “one shot opportunity” possible. The site also claimed that although “this opportunity is legal,”\nthe “Federal Reserve will undoubtedly close the loopholes that allowed the project to take place this once. While the system\nintended on well connected, wealthy individuals to be able to take advantage of this, it was never intended that regular every\nday people would gain access to it.” The site also asked participants to deposit a wire transfer of $5,000—as a signal of their\n“commitment *520 to be involved with the project”—to a bank account in Panama, or to an account with Hibernia National\nBank in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe State also introduced into evidence documents that the Hibernia National Bank in Baton Rouge, Louisiana provided in\nresponse to the State's civil investigative demand. The documents included a commercial new account information card for\nDel Sur International Holdings and its “sole proprietorship resolution certificate,” along with a copy of a Louisiana driver's\nlicense issued to David Jason West. These documents show that David West opened a free small business checking account\nwith $100 cash at Hibernia on August 8, 2005, under the business name of Del Sur International Holdings. He is the sole owner\nand signatory on the account. The account number assigned to the Del Sur International Holdings checking account matches\nthe account number on the Web site to which the participants' $5,000 wire transfers had been directed. The Web site does not\ndisclose that the $5,000 transfers of participants' “commitment money” were deposited into an account owned by David West.\n\nBased on this evidence, the district court determined that West “may be violating the DTPA” and that the State's action “was\nin the public interest.” Indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the court's order as we must, we conclude that there is\nsufficient evidence to support the court's findings in accordance with section 17.47(a). Thus, we overrule West's second issue.\n\n\nSpecificity of order under rule 683\n [7] [8] In its third issue, West claims that the district court's temporary injunction violated rule 683 because it did not state\nthe reasons for its order with specificity. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 683. West argues that the district court's order does not specifically\nstate the reasons why injury will be suffered if the interlocutory relief is not ordered. West also faults the order for its failure to\nstate why the identified probable injury is an irreparable one for which the State has no adequate legal remedy. Under Rule 683\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              7\n\fDavid Jason West and Pydia, Inc. v.

Because we conclude that the order was sufficiently specific under rule\n683, we need not address the waiver issue. 4\n\n *521 Relying on rule 693, the State responds that “the principles, practice and procedure governing courts of equity shall\ngovern proceedings in injunctions when the same are not in conflict with these rules or the provisions of the statutes.” Tex.R.\nCiv. P. 693 (emphasis added); see also Texas Pet Foods, Inc., 591 S.W.2d at 805 (“When it is determined that the statute is\nbeing violated, it is within the province of the district court to restrain it .... [t]he doctrine of balancing the equities has no\napplication to this statutorily authorized injunctive relief.”).\n\nThe State reiterates that section 17.47(a) of the DTPA authorizes the State's consumer protection division to bring an action\nfor injunctive relief when “it has reason to believe that any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in\nany act or practice declared to be unlawful by [the DTPA], and that proceedings would be in the public interest.” Tex. Bus. &\nCom.Code Ann. § 17.47(a). The DTPA also authorizes the court to “make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary\nto compensate identifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been\nacquired by means of any unlawful act or practice.” Id. § 17.47(d). The State contends that the order is proper because it contains\nthe essential findings that “Defendants may be violating § 17.47(a) and (b) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer\nProtection Act,” and that “this action is in the public interest.”\n\nThe court found that the freeze was necessary to prevent West from dissipating funds in the account to which the participants'\nwire transfers had been directed:\n\n            [U]nless Defendants are immediately restrained from the acts prohibited below, Defendants will dissipate\n            funds obtained from consumers through misrepresentations in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices\n            Act, before a full trial can be held on the merits of the State's claims. To the extent required by law,\n            Plaintiff [State] has proved that continued violation of these laws will continue to cause Plaintiff and the\n            general public to suffer irreparable harm.\n\nWe conclude that this order complied with the statutory prerequisites under section 17.47(a) of the DTPA by finding that\n“Defendants may be violating § 17.47(a) and (b) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer Protection Act,” and that\n“this action is in the public interest.” The order also satisfied the specificity requirement of rule 683 by finding that, “unless\nDefendants are immediately restrained *522 from the acts prohibited below, Defendants will dissipate funds obtained from\nconsumers through misrepresentations in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, before a full trial can be held on the\nmerits of the State's claims.” Accordingly, we overrule West's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Your Honor, the proposed order states that given the exhibits and sworn\n             affidavits attached thereto, that unless defendants are immediately restrained from the acts prohibited below, defendants will\n             dissipate funds obtained from consumers through misrepresentation. Is that the court's ruling today?\n          THE COURT: Well, we didn't have any sworn affidavits, I don't think, introduced into evidence, did we?\n          [State's counsel]: No, Your Honor.\n          THE COURT: Okay. I'll make that change. Any other objections to the form?\n          [West's counsel]: No, Your Honor.\n          The State acknowledges that Texas courts are split on whether failure to object to a temporary injunction order results in waiver\n          on appeal or a fatally defective order.

Kirk, 508 S.W.2d 70 (1974)\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\nWALKER, Justice.\n\nThis is an original mandamus proceeding. It was instituted by Betty L. Deen, relator, against F. Edgar Deen, Jr., and the\nHonorable Stanley C. Kirk, Judge of the 78th Judicial District of Wichita County, to require the latter to expunge an order\npurporting to set aside a divorce judgment previously rendered by him. We agree with relator that the judgment in question had\nbecome final and that Judge Kirk had no power to set it aside as he attempted to do. In accordance with our usual procedure\nin cases of this nature, the writ of mandamus will be granted conditionally.\n\nOn June 22, 1973, F. Edgar Deen, Jr., hereinafter referred to as respondent, instituted suit for divorce against relator in Cause\nNo. 94,536—B in the 78th District Court of Wichita County. At the same time he filed a waiver of citation previously executed\nby relator. The jurat on the waiver is dated June 21, 1973. On August 22, 1973, without further notice, citation or waiver, Judge\nKirk rendered judgment granting respondent a divorce and approving an undescribed property settlement agreement. Relator\nfirst learned of these proceedings on October 27, 1973.\n\nOn November 30, 1973, relator filed suit for divorce against respondent in the Domestic Relations Court No. 4 of Tarrant County.\nTemporary injunctions were issued in that suit, and both parties were ordered *71 to file written inventories. Apparently no\nfurther action has been taken in that case, which is still pending in the trial court. It has no bearing on our disposition of this\nmandamus proceeding.\n\nOn December 3, 1973, relator filed in Cause No. 95,544—B in the 78th District Court of Wichita County a petition in the\nnature of a bill of review, praying that the judgment in Cause No. 94,536—B be set aside. On December 13, 1973, Judge Kirk\non his own motion entered an order in Cause No. 94,536—B setting aside the judgment previously rendered in that case. A\nfew days later relator was served with citation in the original divorce case. Respondent then filed in Cause No. 95,544—B a\nmotion to dismiss, alleging that since the judgment in Cause No. 94,536—B had been set aside, the bill of review proceeding\nwas moot. On January 3, 1974, the motion was granted and the bill of review proceeding was dismissed. The original divorce\ncase was also set for trial on the merits.\n\nIt is our understanding that relator appealed the judgment of dismissal in Cause No. 95,544—B to the Court of Civil Appeals.\nSo far as we know, she did not attempt to carry the original divorce judgment in Cause No. 94,536—B to the Court of Civil\nAppeals by writ of error. In the present proceeding she seeks a writ of mandamus to require Judge Kirk to set aside the order\nof December 13, 1973, whereby he attempted to give her the relief she sought by her petition for a bill of review.\n [1] Under the provisions of Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant may waive the issuance and service of\ncitation by filing among the papers of the cause a verified written memorandum ‘signed by him, or by his duly authorized agent\nor attorney, after suit is brought.’ Article 2224, Vernon's Ann.Civ.St., prohibits the waiver of process by an instrument executed\nprior to institution of suit. It is clear then that the waiver executed by relator prior to institution of the divorce suit in Wichita\nCounty did not subject her to the jurisdiction of the court. McAnelly v. Ward, 72 Tex. 342, 12 S.W. 206.\n\n\nRespondents say that since the lack of jurisdiction over relator was apparent from the record, the judgment rendered on August\n22, 1973, was void and could properly be set aside by Judge Kirk at any time. There are Texas decisions that support this\nposition, and respondents cite a number of them. See, for example, Harrison v. Whiteley, Tex.Com.App., 6 S.W.2d 89, where\nit was held that a judgment was void and could be vacated at a subsequent term of court because the lack of jurisdiction over\nthe defendant affirmatively appeared in the ‘judgment roll’, i.e. from the citation on file among the papers in the case.\n\nThe present case is governed by the following provisions of Rule 329b, T.R.C.P.:\n          5. Judgments shall become final after the expiration of thirty (30) days after the date of rendition of judgment\n          or order overruling an original or amended motion for new trial. After the expiration of thirty (30) days\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               2\n\fDeen v. Kirk, 508 S.W.2d 70 (1974)\n\n\n           from the date the judgment is rendered or motion for new trial overruled, the judgment cannot be set aside\n           except by bill of review for sufficient cause, filed within the time allowed by law. . . .\n\n\n\nThe history of these provisions was reviewed in McEwen v. Harrison, 162 Tex. 125, 345 S.W.2d 706, where it was pointed out\nthat the meaning and effect of the two sentences could not be determined from either: (1) decisions in cases tried in district courts\nwhose proceedings were not governed by the Special Practice Act passed by the Legislature in 1923 1 and its amendments and\nextensions or by Rule 330(l), T.R.C.P., as it existed prior to 1955, or (2) decisions in cases tried in county courts before January\n1, 1961. We also *72 observed that the case of Harrison v. Whiteley, Tex.Com.App., 6 S.W.2d 89, is in the latter category.\n\nThe opinion in McEwen recognizes that a bill of review might not be an appropriate method for attacking in the trial court,\nmore than thirty days after the rendition of judgment or order overruling motion for new trial, a judgment in a case which the\ncourt was without jurisdictional power to hear and adjudicate. The words ‘jurisdictional power’ as used in that opinion mean\njurisdiction over the subject matter, the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the particular one\nbelongs. We were not speaking of jurisdiction over the parties. The examples given were the rendition by a county court of\njudgment for divorce or for title to land. In each instance the court would have been utterly without power to render an effective\njudgment on the merits of the controversy.\n\nThe quoted provisions of Rule 329b were construed in McEwen as follows:\n           Accordingly, we construe the emphasized provision of Rule 329—b to mean that when the time for filing\n           a motion for new trial has expired and relief may not be obtained by appeal, a proceeding in the nature of a\n           bill of review is the exclusive method of vacating a default judgment rendered in a case in which the court\n           had jurisdictional power to render it. Into this category will fall those cases in which a default judgment is\n           asserted to be void for want of service, or of valid service, of process. This is in harmony with our holding\n           in Brown v. Clippenger, 113 Tex. 364, 256 S.W. 254. With this construction of the Rule, we may assume,\n           without deciding, that Texaco is correct when it says that the default judgment against it is a void judgment\n           and that its motion to vacate is a direct attack on the judgment. We are yet compelled to hold that the order\n           vacating the default judgment is unauthorized and void because the district court had jurisdictional power to\n           determine the validity of service (Indeed, it was its duty to do so) and to render the judgment, and Texaco's\n           motion to vacate it does not qualify as a bill of review. (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n [2] Paraphrasing the italicized portion of the opinion just quoted, the 78th District Court of Wichita County had jurisdictional\npower to determine the validity and effectiveness of the waiver and to render a judgment for divorce. Relator's petition for a\nbill of review was never heard but was dismissed. In these circumstances and under the provisions of Rule 329b, the order\nof December 13, 1973, purporting to set aside the divorce judgment previously rendered in Cause No. 94,536—B is void and\nshould itself be set aside. We are not to be understood as saying that a bill of review was the only effective remedy available to\nrelator when she learned of the divorce judgment. See Art. 2255, V.A.C.S.; Whitney v. L & L Realty Corp., Tex., 500 S.W.2d\n94; Flynt v. City of Kingsville, 125 Tex. 510, 82 S.W.2d 934. It was, however, the only remedy then available to her in the\ntrial court.\n\n\nWe assume that Judge Kirk will set aside his order of December 13, 1973, promptly after our judgment in this proceeding\nbecomes final. In the event he fails to do so, a writ of mandamus will issue.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Acts 1923, 38th Leg., ch. 105, p. 215, s 1, later codified as Art. 2002, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. 1925.\n\n\n End of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Allied Finance Co. of Dallas, 408 S.W.2d 245 (1966)\n\n\n'AGREED TO AS TO FORM, SUBSTANCE AND ENTRY:\n\n'By /s/ Roy J. True\n\nHenry Klepak, Attorney for Bob DeLee\n\n'/s/ Bob DeLee\n\nBob DeLee, Defendant\n\n'LOCKE, PURNELL, BOREN, LANEY & NEELY\n\n'By: /s/ John D. Crawford,\n\nJohn D. Crawford, Attorney for\n\nAllied Finance Company of Dallas'\n\n\n\n\nAppellant seeks to attack this judgment in two points of error wherein he alleges (1) that the trial court erred in rendering the\nconsent judgment against appellant without a settlement agreement being reduced to writing or entered of record in open court,\nas required by Rule 11, Vernon's Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, to thereby evidence the present consent of the appellant; and\n(2) that the court erred in rendering judgment against appellant in an amount in excess of the pleadings. We find no merit in\neither of these points and overrule same.\n [1] While appellant's points are preserved in an unverified motion for new trial, we find no statement of facts in this record\nwhich would reveal testimony introduced in support of the motion for new trial. Accordingly, the judgment, above recited,\nstands unchallenged and each finding recited therein is presumed to be true.\n\n [2] A casual reference to the judgment clearly demonstrates that it is sufficient to meet every requirement of Rule 11, T.R.C.P.,\nrelied upon by appellant. The recitations contained in the judgment are clear and explicit and the same was made in open court\nand agreed to by not only the attorneys but by the appellant himself. Thus we find appellant complaining of that to which he\nhas agreed. This, he cannot do in the absence of allegation and proof of fraud, collusion, or some similar reason. As early as\n1853 the Supreme Court of Texas had occasion, speaking through Chief Justice Hemphill, to classically announce the rule in\nsuch cases as follows:\n‘* * * appellants are at once confronted with the general principle that consent takes away error, and that a judgment by\nagreement or compromise cannot be impeached, unless for fraud, collusion, or like causes, none of which appear in this record\nor are alleged or assigned. (Citing authorities.) The appellants are concluded by their own consent, and their appeal cannot be\nsustained .’ Dunman v. Hartwell, 9 Tex. 495, 60 Am.Dec. 176.\n\n\n\n[3]   The rule, more recently stated, is expressed in 3 Tex.Jur.2d, s 213, p. 479, as follows:\n          ‘A stipulation by the parties to an action as to the nature and terms of the judgment to be entered constitutes\n          a waiver of all nonjurisdictional errors committed by the court prior to the agreement and judgment and\n          justifies its affirmance, if the agreement is based on a valid consideration and was not obtained by fraud,\n          collusion, or the like.’\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Allied Finance Co. of Dallas, 408 S.W.2d 245 (1966)\n\n\n [4] The rationale of such rule is that a party will not be allowed to complain on appeal of an action or ruling which he invited or\ninduced. Having consented to the action of the court in entering judgment he thereby waives all errors committed or contained\nin the judgment, thus leaving nothing which could properly be considered by an appellate court, except want of jurisdiction.\n *248 Posey v. Plains Pipe Line Co., Tex.Civ.App., 39 S.W.2d 1100; Blume v. Shadyacres Inv. Co., Tex.Civ.App., 83 S.W.2d\n1026; Hall v. McKee, Tex.Civ.App., 179 S.W.2d 590; 69 A.L.R.2d 767 et seq.\n\n [5] Moreover, the final judgment executed by appellant and his attorneys of record was contractual in nature and is governed\nby the laws relating to contracts. Appellant has alleged no valid basis for vacating his contract reduced to judgment. Therefore,\nappellant cannot now be heard to complain that the agreement and judgment be set aside. Plumly v.

TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE\nANN. § 51.014 (Vernon Supp.1989). In six points of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in dissolving\nthe temporary injunction. We affirm.\n\nReliance Machine Works, Inc. was founded in 1982 by appellant and appellee, Natu Patel. Fifty percent of the stock was issued\nto appellant and the remaining fifty percent was issued to Dhanash Patel, Natu Patel's brother. Appellant and Dhanash Patel\nwere the sole officers of the corporation and the only members of the board of directors. In 1983, the parties entered into an oral\nagreement whereby ownership of Reliance would be transferred to appellant's wife, Minaxi Desai, and appellee, Kokila Patel,\nin order to qualify as a minority (female) owned business for the purposes of securing government contracts. Shortly thereafter,\nfifty-one percent of the stock was transferred to appellee, Kokila Patel, and this is where the dispute begins. Appellees contend\nthat the issuance of an additional one percent of the stock to Kokila Patel was permanent in that it was in exchange for $55,000 of\nunpaid salaries. Appellant asserts that this arrangement was only temporary due to the fact that Minaxi Desai was in India at the\ntime, and that the agreement was that ownership in Reliance would be equalized upon her return. When Minaxi Desai returned\nfrom India, Kokila Patel did not relinquish her majority interest. Appellant contends that appellee, Kokila Patel, fraudulently\nobtained the majority interest in Reliance and has used that interest to the detriment of Reliance and appellant.\n\nIn January 1987, appellant brought a shareholder's derivative suit against appellees and on April 2, 1987, the trial court entered\na temporary injunction order enjoining the appellees from engaging in twenty enumerated acts. The temporary injunction order\ndid not include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits. On March 21, 1990, the trial court dissolved the temporary\ninjunction upon a finding that a material and substantial change in circumstances and conditions had occurred since the issuance\nof the temporary injunction, and appellant appealed. On appellant's motion, this court entered a temporary order, pursuant to\nTEX.R.APP.P. 43(c), continuing the injunction pending disposition of this appeal.\n\n [1] By way of a counterpoint, appellees assert that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dissolving the temporary\ninjunction because the original temporary injunction order did not comply with TEX.R.CIV.P. 683. Rule 683 provides, in\npertinent part, that:\n\n             Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits\n             with respect to the ultimate relief sought.\n\nTEX.R.CIV.P. 683. The trial court's April 2, 1987 order granting the temporary injunction did not include an order setting the\ncause for trial on the merits. We agree that had appellees appealed from the original order, the temporary injunction should have\nbeen dissolved. E.g., Interfirst Bank San Felipe N.A. v. Paz Construction Co., 715 S.W.2d 640 (Tex.1986). However, appellees\ndid not perfect an appeal from the initial order, and the time limit for doing so has long since expired. See TEX.R.APP.P.\n42(a). Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to review the validity of the trial court's April 2, 1987 order granting the temporary\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Houston Pipeline Co., 737 S.W.2d 15, 16 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1987, no writ); Tober v.\nTurner of Texas, Inc., 668 S.W.2d 831, 834 (Tex.App.—Austin 1984, no writ). Appellees' counterpoint is overruled.\n\n [2] [3] The decision to dissolve a temporary injunction is a matter lying within the broad discretion of the trial court.\nOur review of the trial court's order of dissolution *642 is limited to the narrow question of whether the trial court's action\nconstituted a clear abuse of discretion. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 834; State v. Friedmann, 572 S.W.2d 373, 375 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Corpus Christi 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The trial court has the authority to dissolve a temporary injunction upon a showing of\nchanged conditions. See, e.g., Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835–36. Here, appellees' motion to dissolve alleged that, since the issuance\nof the temporary injunction, appellees had been effectively excluded from any participation in the operations and management of\nReliance. After three days of testimony in a contested hearing, the trial court dissolved the injunction upon a finding of material\nand substantial changes in circumstances and conditions since the issuance of the temporary injunction on April 2, 1987.\n\n [4] Appellant's first point of error asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in dissolving the temporary injunction because\nthere was no change in circumstances that altered the status quo that existed at the time the temporary injunction was granted.\nWe cannot agree. The trial court heard testimony that numerous changes in Reliance had occurred since the issuance of the\ntemporary injunction. These changes were made at the direction of appellant and without the participation of Kokila Patel, the\nmajority shareholder and member of Reliance's board of directors.\n\nAppellees introduced testimony at the hearing to show that appellant had relocated Reliance to a larger facility. The testimony\nindicated that the new site was environmentally contaminated by leaking gasoline tanks. The relocation of the business was\na part of appellant's course of expansion which would include increased numbers of employees and equipment. In relocating\nthe company, appellant entered into a new lease agreement which called for increased monthly rent and insurance costs.\nFurthermore, Reliance's new landlord would become a business entity operated by members of appellant's family. Whether\nthese changes were beneficial to Reliance or not, they were completed without the knowledge or participation of Kokila Patel.\nFurther testimony revealed that Kokila Patel had even been barred admittance to Reliance's facilities.\n\nWhen the temporary injunction was issued, Kokila Patel was in possession of 51% of the outstanding stock in Reliance. The\ndispute in the underlying case involves the ownership of the 1% controlling interest. Rather than curtail Kokila Patel's alleged\nabuse of that controlling interest, ample testimony was introduced to show that, since the issuance of the temporary injunction,\nKokila Patel has been deprived of any participation in the management, operation, and benefits of Reliance. Under these\ncircumstances, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dissolving the temporary injunction. The first point\nof error is overruled.\n\nIn his second point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it dissolved the temporary injunction\nbecause the dissolution imperils his rights. In support of this contention appellant relies on the holding in Lone Star Mining Co.\nv. Texeramics, Inc., 340 S.W.2d 871 (Tex.Civ.App.—Eastland 1960, writ ref'd n.r.e.). In Lone Star, the court held that “[w]here\nit appears that a continuation of a temporary injunction cannot imperil the rights of the adverse party, but its dissolution may\nseriously jeopardize the rights of the complaining party, the temporary injunction should be continued in force.” Id. at 874. As\nour prior discussion reflects, the trial court was presented with ample evidence tending to show that the continuation of the\ntemporary injunction would imperil the rights of the appellees. Therefore, appellant's contention is without merit. We overrule\nthe second point of error.\n\nAppellant's third point of error asserts that even if changed circumstances existed, the trial court abused its discretion by\ndissolving the temporary injunction rather than modifying it to order that Kokila Patel be consulted in future management\ndecisions. Appellant cites no authority in support of this contention. However, based upon our review of the record before us,\n *643 and our discussion relating to appellant's first point of error, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\ndissolving the temporary injunction rather than modifying it to reflect that Kokila Patel be consulted in future management\ndecisions. Appellant's third point of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J.\n\nThe record in this case is very defective. *496 The proceedings and judgment were based on a mandate of the Supreme\nCourt; but the mandate is not transcribed. It should have been the first entry, and a copy should have been transmitted with the\ntranscript. The judgment which we are invoked to revise and reverse was entered by consent. It commences with the recital that\nthe “case coming on to be heard upon the mandate from the Supreme Court, the parties appeared by their attorneys and agreed\nto the following decree to be entered as the judgment of this court,” &c., &c. This agreement was made by the attorneys of\nthe parties; but no objection is taken to the judgment on that ground. It is not assigned or contended that their authority should\nhave appeared of record. No question is raised as to their power. That they had competent authority must be presumed until it\nis impugned and the contrary shown, and the judgment must be taken as having been agreed to by the parties themselves; under\nthis aspect the appellants are at once confronted with the general principle that consent takes away error, and that a judgment by\nagreement or compromise cannot be impeached, unless for fraud, collusion, or like causes, none of which appear in this record\nor are alleged or assigned. (Story v. Hawkins et al., 8 Da. R., 12; French v. Hotwell, 5 Johns. Chan. R., 555; 14 Ves. R., 31.)\n\nThe appellants are concluded by their own consent, and their appeal cannot be sustained.\n\nBut if the decree had not been entered by consent there does not appear any such substantial error prejudicial to the appellants\nas would have authorized a reversal.\n\nThe mandate of the Supreme Court required the rights of Mrs. Hartwell, under the deed of gift, and of her minor children to\na portion of the estate under the law to be respected; and this appears in substance to have been done, in accordance with the\nspirit and intent of the mandate, and without injustice to the other distributees of the estate.\n\nAfter deducting the property or its value embraced in the deed of gift, the surplus was directed to be equally divided *497\nbetween the heirs of the deceased. This has been effected, as to the real estate, by establishing the partition formerly made and\nof record in the County Court; and if execution has been given the widow for the value of her property under the deed of gift,\nand the minor heirs for the value of their shares respectively of the personal property, it arose doubtless from the fact that this\nproperty had been converted by the other parties to their own use.\n\nThe errors assigned are:\n\n1st.

Hartwell, 9 Tex. 495 (1853)\n60 Am.Dec. 176\n\n\nThe mandate under which the District Court was acting directed the minors, Francis and Hansel, to have shares of the estate\nequal to those of the other distributees. To effect this the former partition in which their shares were set apart was recognized or\nconfirmed; and if the Dunmans had in the meantime sold any portion of the land formerly assigned to these minors, it was but\nequitable that the deficiency should be made up out of the lands set apart as the distributive share of Rachel. Such a disposition\nwas in conformity with the spirit of the mandate, was but just to the minors, and could not operate to the injury of the appellants.\n\n3d. That Francis M. and Hansel R.

Appellee sells its products in Texas and in other states. Appellants, the State Fire Marshal and his employees, took the\nposition that appellee could not lawfully sell its products in Texas and actively interfered with appellee's efforts to make such\nsales.\n\nAppellee filed a declaratory judgment suit in the district court of Travis County and, ancillary to its declaratory judgment suit,\nsought a temporary injunction. After hearing, the district court temporarily enjoined appellants from (a) “taking any action\nwhatsoever to interfere with the marketing, sale or delivery of Fires Out, Inc. fire extinguishers”; and from (b) “contacting any\nperson for the purpose of stating or representing that fire extinguishers manufactured or sold by Fires Out, Inc. may not legally\nbe sold in Texas.” This Court will affirm the district court's temporary injunctive order.\n\n [1] Appellants attack the district court's order by two points of error. By their first point, appellants assert that the injunctive\norder must be dissolved because the reasons for its issuance are not sufficiently set out as required by Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 683\n(Supp.1987). Rule 683 provides that every order granting an injunction “shall set forth the reasons for its issuance.”\n\nThe only reason set forth in the district court's order is as follows:\n\n             The Court considered the verified pleadings, the evidence, and arguments of counsel, and finds and\n             concludes that the plaintiff has shown and demonstrated its right to a temporary injunction under the law,\n             and the Court further concludes that plaintiff's sale of its fire extinguisher product within the State of\n             Texas is exempted from regulation by the State Fire Marshal under Section 6(d) of Article 5.43–1.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Fires Out, Inc., 735 S.W.2d 492 (1987)\n\n\n\n\nWe need not determine, however, whether the order is in violation of Rule 683 because appellants failed to preserve the claimed\nerror for appellate review. Although appellants filed a “Motion for Reconsideration,” they did not point out to the district court\nany claimed deficiency in the form of the order.\n\nTexas R.App.P.Ann. 52(a) (Supp.1987) provides generally that\n\n            [i]n order to preserve a complaint for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a\n            timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling he desired the court to\n            make.... (Emphasis supplied).\n\nRule 52(a) derives from Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 373 (1985). To preserve error, Rule 373 required a party to make known to the court\nthe desired action and the party's grounds therefor at the time the ruling or order was made or sought. Rule 373 was applied\nto errors committed by the trial court in the entry of judgments. Travis Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Small, 662 S.W.2d 406,\n414 (Tex.App.1983, no writ). In Travis Heights, the appellant complained that the trial court had failed to include a particular\nfinding in the judgment. This Court stated in response:\n\n            We think that appellant's second point of error goes only to the form of the judgment. As such, it was\n            waived by appellant's failure to make a motion to reform the judgment, or to in some other way *494\n            make the complaint known to the trial court.\n\nSee also Plasky v. Gulf Insurance Co., 160 Tex. 612, 335 S.W.2d 581, 584 (1960) (appellant waived error concerning time\nperiod, stated in judgment, during which interest on judgment could be collected, when he failed to object or except to judgment\n—R. 373); Whatley v. Whatley, 493 S.W.2d 299, 304 (Tex.Civ.App.1973, no writ) (defendant who failed to object to judgment\nawarding child support in lump sum rather than to individual children waived error). In Delhi Gas Pipeline Corp. v. Lamb,\n724 S.W.2d 97 (Tex.App.1987, writ pending), the El Paso Court of Appeals expressly held that Rule 52(a) carried forward the\nprovisions of Rule 373, and that the rationale of Plasky and other opinions decided under Rule 373 applied under Rule 52(a).\n\nPrinciples of sound judicial administration support application of the waiver rule in this appeal. As in the above opinions,\nthere was no claimed error present until the judgment was prepared and presented to the district court. At that time, appellants\ncould have moved to modify or change the terms of the judgment. It serves no good purpose to permit appellants to lie in wait\nand present this error in form for the first time on appeal. On proper request, the district court could easily have added to the\njudgment a description of the specific harm avoided by granting the temporary injunction. Appellants would then have obtained\nproper notice of the district court's reasoning and appellate review would have been facilitated.\n\nAlthough appellants did request the district court to reconsider the order, appellants did not raise the facial inadequacy of\nthe order. Accordingly, appellants' motion did not preserve the error. See, e.g., State v. Williams, 357 S.W.2d 799, 800–01\n(Tex.Civ.App.1962, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see also Tex.R.App.P. 52(a) (objection must state “specific grounds”).\n\n [2] [3] [4] By their second point of error, appellants complain that the district court abused its discretion in granting the\ninjunctive order because appellee did not demonstrate a probable right to recovery. In a hearing on an application for a temporary\ninjunction, the only question before the trial court is the appellant's right to the preservation of the status quo of the subject\nmatter of the suit, pending a final trial on the merits. To warrant the issuance of a temporary injunction, the applicant need only\nshow a probable right and a probable injury; he is not required to establish that he will finally prevail in the litigation. The trial\ncourt is clothed with broad discretion in determining whether the pleadings and evidence present a case of probable right and\nprobable injury. The trial court's order in issuing or denying the writ of injunction will be reversed only on a showing of a clear\nabuse of discretion. There is no abuse of discretion in the issuance of a writ of injunction if the petition alleges a cause of action\nand the evidence tends to sustain it. Transport Co. of Texas v. Robertson Transports, 152 Tex. 551, 261 S.W.2d 549 (1953).\nFurther, there is no abuse of discretion where the trial court predicates its order upon conflicting evidence. Davis v. Huey, 571\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             3\n\fEmerson v. Fires Out, Inc., 735 S.W.2d 492 (1987)\n\n\nS.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex.1978). Even questions of law “can only be determined from a review of the entire record after a full and\nfinal hearing.” Transport Co. of Texas v. Robertson Transports, supra.\n\nThe district court concluded that appellee's sale of its fire extinguishers within Texas was exempted from regulation by\nTex.Ins.Code art. 5.43–1 § 6(d) (1981). That provision provides as follows:\n\n  The provisions of this article do not apply to the following:\n\n\n\n\n  firms engaged in the retailing or wholesaling of portable fire extinguishers as defined in Section 3, but not engaged in the\n  installation or recharging of them.... (Emphasis supplied).\n\nAppellants argue that the district court erred in applying this exemption to appellee because there was insufficient proof that\nappellee was “retailing or wholesaling” portable fire extinguishers. Although the proof is somewhat lacking in clarity, appellants\nconcede that Lawrence C. Lasalle, a salesman of Fires Out fire extinguishers, *495 testified that appellee “lost sales” due\nto the Fire Marshal's actions. Lasalle's testimony is some evidence from which the district court could conclude that appellee\nqualified for the statutory exemption.\n\nAppellants contend, alternatively, that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to ignore the § 6(d) exemption entirely.\nAppellants claim that § 6(d) is an anachronism, an exemption that the legislature should have omitted when art. 5.43–1 was\namended to regulate the sale of fire extinguishers as well as their installation and servicing. According to appellants, giving\neffect to § 6(d) defeats the legislature's intent to regulate the sale of portable fire extinguishers “as a measure of public safety.”\nIn support of their contention, appellants point to art. 5.43–1, § 1, which provides:\n\n             The purpose of this article is to regulate the leasing, renting, selling, and servicing of portable fire\n             extinguishers and the installing and servicing of fixed fire extinguisher systems, in the interest of\n             safeguarding lives and property. (Emphasis supplied).\n\n\nAppellee, in turn, relies upon the general rule of statutory construction that every word of the statute is presumed to have purpose\nand each sentence, clause, phrase and word should be given effect if reasonably possible. Ex Parte Pruitt, 551 S.W.2d 706, 709\n(Tex.1977). Appellee reminds us that this rule is particularly appropriate in the case of a penal statute, such as art. 5.43–1 (see\n§ 12), because penal statutes must be strictly construed. First Bank of Bedford v. Miller, 563 S.W.2d 572, 577 (Tex.1978).\n\nUpon examination of the statute, it appears to this Court that the district court could reasonably have given effect to the\nexemption consistent with the statute's overall intent. Section 6(d) only exempts firms selling portable fire extinguishers “as\ndefined in Section 3.” Section 3(c) defines a “portable fire extinguisher,” in part, as one that “has a label of approval attached\nby a nationally recognized testing laboratory....” Accordingly, the § 6(d) exemption only applies to sales of approved fire\nextinguishers. Sale of unapproved fire extinguishers thus remains subject to sanction under art. 5.43–1, § 10(9) (prohibiting sale\nof fire extinguishers in violation of § 5(a)), and § 5(a) (prohibiting sale of unapproved fire extinguishers). Such a construction\npreserves the exemption and still gives effect to the legislative intent to make portable fire extinguishers safe.\n\nThe record supports appellee's contention that its product carries the label of approval by a “nationally recognized laboratory.”\nRonald Wells, director of General Laboratories, the test laboratory for appellee, testified that General Laboratories is a member\nlaboratory of the American Society of Testing Materials, a nationally recognized testing and certification board. Although\nWells indicated that Kansas, the state in which General Laboratories is located, had not certified it as a nationally recognized\nlaboratory, the conflicting evidence provided a reasonable basis for the district court's determination that General Laboratories\nwas nationally recognized. Huey v. Davis, supra.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                4\n\fEmerson v. Fires Out, Inc., 735 S.W.2d 492 (1987)\n\n\nAppellants contend, the evidence aside, that the Fire Marshal's determination that General Laboratories is not nationally\nrecognized is conclusive on this point. No one disputes that the term “nationally recognized testing laboratory” is undefined by\nthe statute. The Fire Marshal asserts, nonetheless, that his statutory duty to “administer, enforce and carry out the applicable\nprovisions of the code ...,” Tex.Ins.Code Ann. art. § 1.09(a), requires him to set the correct standard. Perhaps the Fire Marshal's\nassertion is correct, especially since art. 5.43–1, § 2 gives the State Board of Insurance power to promulgate rules and regulations\nfor the administration of the article “through the State Fire Marshal.” Nevertheless, as the testimony of the Fire Marshal's\nmanager of licensing investigation, Quay Wood, makes plain, neither the State Board of Insurance nor the Fire Marshal has made\nany attempt to articulate a standard by which testing laboratories may be measured.

Coffee, George T. Thomas, John R. Coffee, Big Spring, for relators.\n\nRalph Logan, San Angelo, for respondent.\n\nOpinion\n\nCALVERT, Justice.\n\nThis is an original habeas corpus proceeding filed in this court by relators to relieve themselves of penalties imposed by a\njudgment of contempt entered by the District Court of the 51st Judicial District. The judgment of contempt and imposition of\npenalties grew out of a violation by relators of a temporary injunction granted by the court in the following fact situation.\n\nOn May 29, 1959 R. L. Damron, a resident of Crane County, and Wm. W. Gruber, a resident of Tom Green County, presented\nto the judge of the aforesaid court at his chambers in Tom Green County their petition in which they sought injunctive relief\nagainst Kathleen Amberson, a resident of Dallas County, and John Coffee, G. L Holley and Louis Bankston, all residents of\nHoward County. It was alleged that plaintiffs were the owners of an interest in leasehold estates owned by Amberson Petroleum\nCompany in certain lands located in Sterling County, which estates were subject to a deed of trust lien given to secure an\nindebtedness in favor of Mrs. Amberson; that the indebtedness was not due until September 10, 1959, but that the defendant,\nJohn Coffee, as substitute trustee, had posted notices of his intention to sell the property on June 2nd under power of sale\ncontained in the deed of trust and unless restrained and enjoined from so doing would make the sale, to the plaintiffs irreparable\ninjury. They prayed for a restraining order, for a temporary injunction and for a permanent injunction until the debt should\nbecome due.\n\nUpon presentation of the petition to the District Judge a restraining order was issued restraining the defendant, John Coffee,\nfrom selling the property pending a hearing to be held on the prayer for a temporary injunction, which hearing was set at 10\no'clock a. m., June 8th, in the courtroom of the District Court in the courthouse at Sterling City, Sterling County, within *226\nthe 51st Judicial District. The issuance of the restraining order was conditioned upon the filing by Damron and Gruber of a\nbond in the penal sum of $7,500, conditioned as required by law. A bond in that sum, conditioned that Damron and Gruber\nwould abide the decision in the case and would pay all sums of money and costs which might be adjudged against them if ‘the\nrestraining order’ should be dissolved, in whole or in part, was approved and filed by the Clerk of the District Court, Sterling\nCounty, on June 2, and the sale advertised for that date was avoided.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing on June 8th the court granted a temporary injunction restraining and enjoining all defendants\nfrom selling the property at trustee's sale under the deed of trust pending final hearing and determination of the cause or until\nSeptember 10, 1959, whichever was earlier in time. The judgment contained the following order: ‘And the bond heretofore filed\nwith the Clerk upon issuance of the restraining order herein be, and is hereby continued in full force and effect as a temporary\ninjunction bond.’\n\n **286 On July 15th the District Judge, sitting in Sterling County, pursuant to a show cause order and after hearing, determined\nthat on July 7th relators, Coffee and Holley, did, in violation of the temporary injunction and in contempt of the court, sell and\ncause to be sold the property at trustee's slae to relator Holley, and that Coffee, as substitute trustee, executed, a deed conveying\nthe property to Holley, which deed had been filed for record and recorded in Sterling County. The court assessed a fine of $100\nagainst each of the defendants and ordered them confined in jail for twenty-four hours and thereafter until the fines and costs\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It is from these penalties that relators seek relief in this proceeding.\n [1] Relators recognize the collateral nature of the attack they make on the trial court's judgment and that they are entitled to\nrelief in this proceeding only if the judgment is void. They assert that the judgment is void for two reasons: because the trial\ncourt had no power, authority or jurisdiction to grant the temporary injunction, and because no bond was required or filed as\na condition precedent to the issuance of the writ of temporary injunction as required by Rule 684, Texas Rules of *227 Civil\nProcedure. If the order granting the writ of temporary injunction and the writ itself were void, then the judgment of contempt\nis also void. Ex parte Coward, 110 Tex. 587, 222 S.W. 531.\n\n\nRelator's contention that the order granting the injunction was void because the court was without power or jurisdiction to grant\nit is based upon the failure of the trial judge to comply with Articles 4643 and 4656, Vernon's Annotated Texas Civil Statutes.\n\nArticle 4643 relates to the granting of writs of injunction by nonresident judges and reads as follows:\n‘No district judge shall grant a writ of injunction returnable to any other court than his own except in the following cases:\n\n‘1. Where the resident judge cannot hear and act upon the application by reason of his absence, sickness, inability, inaccessibility,\ndisqualification or refusal to act, when such facts are fully set out in the application or in an affidavit accompanying same, and\nif such judge refuses to act, such refusal shall be indorsed by said judge on such writ with his reasons therefor. In such case no\ndistrict judge shall grant the writ when the application therefor has once been acted upon by another district judge of this State.\n\n‘2. To stay execution, or to restrain foreclosure, sales under deeds of trust, trespasses, the removal of property, or acts injurious\nto or impairing riparian or easement rights, when satisfactory proof is made to such nonresident judge that it is impracticable\nfor the applicant to reach the resident judge and procure his action in time to effectuate the purpose of the application.\n\n‘3. When the resident judge cannot be reached by the ordinary and available means of travel and communication in sufficient\ntime to effectuate the purpose of the writ sought. In such case the applicant or his attorney seeking a writ on the ground of such\ninaccessibility shall attach to his application an affidavit fully stating the facts of such inaccessibility and his efforts made to\nreach and communicate with said judge, and the result thereof, and unless such efforts appear to have been fair and reasonable\nthe application shall not be heard. Such injunction may be subsequently dissolved upon it being **287 shown *228 that the\npetitioner did not first make reasonable efforts to procure a hearing upon said application before the resident judge.’\n\n\nArticle 4656 reads as follows:\n          ‘Writs of injunction granted to stay proceedings in a suit, or execution on a judgment, shall be returnable\n          to and tried in the court where such suit is pending, or such judgment was rendered; writs of injunction\n          for other causes, if the party against whom it is granted be an inhabitant of the State, shall be returnable\n          to and tried in the district or county court of the county in which such party has his domicile, according as\n          the amount or matter in controversy comes within the jurisdiction of either of said courts. If there be more\n          than one party against whom a writ is granted, it may be returned and tried in the proper court of the county\n          where either may ahve his domicile.’\n\n\n [2] It is settled that Art. 4656 only applies to and governs the issuance and return of writs and trial in cases in which the relief\nsought is purely or primarily injunctive. Southwest Weather Research, Inc. v. Jones, Tex.Sup., 327 S.W.2d 417; Brown v. Gulf\nTelevision Co., 157 Tex. 607, 306 S.W.2d 706. In that type of suit Article 4643 directs that no district judge shall issue a writ\nreturnable to any court other than his own except in specified emergency situations and upon adequate proof of the emergency,\nand if one of the emergency situations arises which authorizes the granting of emergency restraint by a nonresident judge, Art.\n4656 directs, with the two exceptions set out in the opening clause, that the writ be made returnable to the county of residence\nof the defendant or of one of the defendants if there be more than one.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It also shows on its face that one of the defendants\nwas a resident of Dallas County and the other three were residents of Howard County. We take judicial notice that neither\nDallas nor Howard County is in the 51st Judicial District. It further shows on its face that the restraint sought was not to stay\nproceedings in a suit or execution on a judgment, but was to restrain a sale under a deed of trust. With those facts before him the\nDistrict Judge, without requiring an affidavit or proof that it was impracticable to reach the District Judge of Howard County\nor one of the District Judges of Dallas County and procure action from one of them in time to halt the sale, granted *229\na temporary restraining order returnable to his own court in Sterling County and there tried the right of the plaintiffs to and\ngranted a temporary writ of injunction. The order granting the writ did not direct to what court the writ was returnable and the\nwrit, if one was actually issued, is not in the record. We may assume, however, that the writ was returnable and returned to the\ncourt from which it was issued from the fact that the contempt hearing was held in that court.\n\n\nIn asserting that the proceedings are void relators rely on Bridges v. Williams, Tex.Civ.App., 154 S.W.2d 669, no writ history;\nUvalde Rock Asphalt Co. v. Asphalt Belt R. Co., Tex.Com.App., 262 S.W. 736, reversed on rehearing Tex.Com.App., 267\nS.W. 688, and City of Dallas v. Armour & Co., Tex.Civ.App., 216 S.W. 222. To that list of cases affording seeming support for\nrelators' position may be added Box v. Oliver, Tex.Civ.App., 43 S.W.2d 979, no writ history, and Anderson v. Southwestern\nPresbyterian Home, etc., Tex.Civ.App., 248 S.W.2d 775, writ dismissed.\n\nIn Bridges v. Williams, a suit solely for injunctive relief filed in the 77th Judicial District in and for Limestone County, the\nDistrict Judge granted an ex parte writ of temporary injunction against a resident of Caldwell County, which was not within the\n **288 77th Judicial District, and made the writ returnable to his own court. On appeal the Court of Civil Appeals reversed\nthe judgment of the trial court, dissolved the writ of injunction and ordered the suit dismissed. In the course of its opinion the\ncourt pointed out that plaintiff's petition showed on its face that the defendant was a resident of Caldwell County, and said: ‘The\npetition shows upon its face that the judge of the 77th Judicial District of Texas was without statutory right or power to issue\nthe temporary writ of injunction, as well as without authority to make the same returnable to his court.' 1 154 S.W.2d 671. In\nsupport of its conclusion the court cited City of Dallas v. Armour, supra, and Box v. Oliver, supra.\n\nIn City of Dallas v. Armour, the plaintiffs in a suit against residents of Dallas County to cancel a contract performable in Dallas\nCounty and to enjoin its performance pendente lite presented their petition to the District Judge of the 66th Judicial District,\nHill County, and, upon the theory that the District Judges of Dallas County were disqualified to act, secured an exparte writ\nof temporary injunction returnable to the District Court of the 14th Judicial District of Dallas County, where the *230 suit\nwas directed to be filed. On appeal, the Court of Civil Appeals held the District Judges of Dallas County to be qualified to\nact and, citing Article 4643, said: ‘* * * the nonresident judge who issued the writ, was without authority to do so, since he\nacted and assumed to act only on the basis that the Dallas county judges were disqualified, and, being without authority, his\nact is void.’ 216 S.W. 225.\n\nIn Box v. Oliver, the Judge of the District Court of the 77th Judicial District granted an ex parte writ of injunction, pending\nfurther order of the court, against the sheriff of Robertson County, a county not within the 77th Judicial District. On appeal the\nCourt of Civil Appeals, citing Articles 4643 and 4656, dissolved the injunction, holding that ‘the court was without authority\nto make the order’ of restraint. 43 S.W.2d 980.\n\nIn Anderson v. Southwestern Presbyterian Home, etc., the plaintiff filed suit in the District Court of the 66th Judicial District,\nHill County, seeking purely injunctive relief against a resident of Tarrant County, a county not within the 66th Judicial District.\nAfter hearing, the court overruled the defendants' plea of privilege and by separate order granted a temporary injunction. On\nappeal the Court of Civil Appeals held both orders to be erroneous and reversed and ordered the cause transferred to one of\nthe District Courts of Tarrant County. With reference to the order granting the writ of temporary injunction, the court said\nthat the trial court ‘was without the statutory right or power to issue the temporary writ of injunction against the defendant\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Each of the cases was before\nthe respective Courts of Civil Appeals by appeal from the trial court's order, and dissolution of the various orders of restraint\nwas proper on the ground that they were irregularly and erroneously granted. The cases analyzed are therefore not regarded\nas controlling or as particularly persuasive.\n\n\nArticle 4643 was originally enacted in 1907 as a proviso to Article 2989 of the Revised Civil Statutes of 1895. Acts of Regular\n *231 Session, 30th Leg., ch. 107, p. 206. As thus amended Art. 2989 was codified as **289 Art. 4643 of the Revised Civil\nStatutes of 1911. In the codification of 1925 the first part of Art. 4643 of the 1911 statutes was carried forward as Art. 4642\nand the proviso was carried forward as Art. 4643. In the process of codification the language of the proviso was materially\naltered. We need note only a few of the pertinent alterations. In the original Act and in the 1911 statute it was provided that a\nnonresident district judge should have no power to grant a writ of injunction returnable to any other court than his own, unless\nthe resident judge was absent from his district, or was sick and unable to hear and act on the application, or was inaccessible, or\nhad refused to act, or was disqualified; and the applicant was required to set out the facts of, and relating to, the resident judge's\nabsence, sickness, inability to act, inaccessibility or disqualification in his application or in an accompanying affidavit. If the\nbasis for seeking action by a nonresident judge was inaccessibility of the resident judge the applicant was required to file with\nhis application an affidavit showing the efforts made to reach and communicate with the resident judge, and it was provided that\na nonresident judge should have no power to grant relief unless it appeared from the affidavit that a fair and reasonable effort\nhad been made to secure relief from the resident judge. But while providing that a nonresident judge would have no power\nto grant relief because of inaccessibility of the resident judge unless the required affidavit showed fair and reasonable efforts\nto obtain relief from the resident judge, the statute did not declare violative action by the nonresident judge voil. Instead, it\ndeclared that a violative injunction should be dissolved upon a showing that a reasonable effort had not been made to procure\na hearing before the resident judge. In the present statute there is no express reference to a want of power in a nonresident\njudge to act; a want of power can only be implied from the opening words of the Article: ‘No district judge shall grant a writ\nof injunction returnable to any other court than his own except * * *.’ Moreover, the Article still provides for dissolution of\nan injunction granted by a nonresident judge upon proof that the applicant ‘did not first make reasonable efforts to procure\na hearing upon said application before the resident judge.’ In the original Act and in the 1911 statute a ‘resident judge’ was\ndefined as one ‘in whose district the suit is, or is to be brought,’ and we will ascribe to the term that meaning even though the\ndefinition was eliminated in the 1925 codification. We interpret the words ‘in whose district the suit is * * * to be brought’\nto mean the district in which venue properly lies as shown on the face of the petition. Conversely, a nonresident *232 judge\nis one in whose district the suit is not filed or in whose district venue, as shown on the face of an unfiled petition, does not\nproperly lie. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Art. 4643 are interrelated and must be construed as overlapping.\n\nArticle 4656, with a few minor and unimportant changes in verbiage, is derived from what may be termed the first comprehensive\npractice act governing judicial proceedings in the State of Texas. It was enacted by the First Legislature of the State of texas\nin 1846. Gammel's Laws of Texas, Vol. 2, pp. 1669, 1711-1712.\n [5] Articles 4643 and 4656 are but two of a series of Articles in Title 76 of the Revised Civil Statutes of 1925, Vernon's\nAnn.Civ.St. art. 4642 et seq., dealing with injunctions. As written they formed a logical procedural whole applicable to our\npractice before adoption of the Rules of Civil Procedure in 1941. They contemplated that a trial judge could, upon presentation\nof a sworn petition therefor and before the filing of suit, grant a writ of temporary injunction without a hearing, Arts. 4647 and\n4648, effective upon the filing of bond, Art. 4649, whereupon the party to whom the writ was granted would file his petition and\nthe court's order with the clerk of the proper court, Art. 4650, the clerk would issue the writ, Art. 4652, and it would be served\nby an officer and **290 returned to the court from which it issued, Art. 4653, or to the court to which it was made returnable.\nArt. 4656. Restraint under a temporary writ continued, unless dissolved, until the case was finally disposed of. Riggins v.\nThompson, 96 Tex. 154, 71 S.W. 14, 15; Ex parte Zuccaro, 106 Tex. 197, 163 S.W. 579, 580. Relief from the restraint of a\ntemporary writ was obtainable through a motion to dissolve.

Rule 681. Under the Rules of Civil Procedure the purpose once\nserved by an exparte temporary injunction in obtaining immediate restraint is now served exclusively by an ex parte restraining\norder, Rule 680, but it will be noted that Arts. 4643 and 4656 nowhere expressly mention or purport to govern issuance, service\nor return of restraining orders. However, a restraining order is one type of injunction, Riggins v. Thompson, supra; Ex parte\nZuccaro, supra, and inasmuch as restraining orders serve the same purpose under the Rules as was theretofore served, in part,\nby temporary injunctions, and in order to bring the statutes and the Rules into a harmonious whole, we interpret the term ‘writs\nof injunction’ as used in Arts. 4643 and 4656 to include ‘temporary restraining order’ as provided for in Rule 680. It is under\nthat interpretation *233 that we test the validity of the proceedings in the trial court in this case.\n\n [6] The proceedings leading up to the judgment of contempt against relators were undoubtedly irregular and erroneous. Upon\npresentation of the petition to the District Judge it was his duty to make any restraining order granted by him returnable to a\nDistrict Court of Dallas or Howard County, and he was authorized to grant it in the first instance only upon the filing of an\naffidavit showing the inaccessibility of the district judges of those counties and that fair and reasonable efforts had been made\nby the plaintiffs to reach such judges but that it was impracticable to reach them and to obtain action from one of them in time\nto halt the sale. Not only were the proceedings in the granting and return of the restraining order irregular and erroneous, but the\nproceedings in trying in Sterling County the right of the applicants to a temporary writ and in making it returnable to the District\nCourt of the 51st Judicial District Court were also irregular and erroneous. But the important question here is not whether the\nproceedings were irregular and erroneous, but whether they were wholly void. We hold that they were not.\n\n [7] The only types of suits in which the return of a writ as required by Article 4656 has been held jurisdictional are those to stay\nproceedings in a suit or execution on a judgment, Baker v. Crosbyton Southplains R. Co., 107 Tex. 566, 182 S.W. 287; Seligson\nv. Collins, 64 Tex. 314; Switzer v. Smith, Tex.Com.App., 300 S.W. 31, 68 A.L.R. 377, and even in suits of that character it has\nbeen held by the Court of Criminal Appeals that failure to make the writ returnable as directed by the statute does not justify\nviolation of the injunction or relieve a violator from punishment for contempt. Ex parte Breeding, Tex.Cr.App., 90 S.W. 634.\nSince the instant suit is not one of that character it is unnecessary for us to decide whether we would follow that decision.\nThere is far less reason for holding void a writ of injunction made returnable to the court issuing it in other types of suits. As to\nsuch other types of suits our courts have recognized that the statute is primarily a venue statute. Brown v. Gulf Television Co.,\n157 Tex. 607, 306 S.W.2d 706; Uvalde Rock Asphalt Co. v. Asphalt Belt R. Co., Tex.Com.App., 262 S.W. 736, on rehearing\nTex.Com.App., 267 S.W. 688; Perry v. Jaggers, Tex.Civ.App., 9 S.W.2d 143, writ dismissed; Pipe Line Workers Local No. 38\nv. H. b. Zachry Co., Tex.Civ.App., 276 S.W.2d 876, writ refused, n. r. e. Whereas in the two types of suits designated in the\nfirst clause of the statute any injunction granted, if not *234 made returnable to the court **291 where the suit is pending or\nthe judgment was rendered, would bring about an immediate conflict between two courts, often of coordinate jurisdiction, that\nwould not be true with respect to the issuance, return and trial of the right to an injunction in other types of suits, particularly\nwhen, as in this case, the injunctive relief is sought and granted before suit is filed. Our specific holding is that when a suit\nis one for purely injunctive relief other than to stay proceedings in a suit or execution on a judgment, and the relief is sought\nand granted before the filing of suit, the order granting the relief is not void for failure to make the restraining order returnable\nto the county of residence of the defendant or of one of them, nor is a writ of temporary injunction thereafter granted by the\ncourt issuing the restraining order, void.\n\n [8] We also hold that orders entered by a nonresident judge granting a temporary restraining order and a temporary writ of\ninjunction without requiring the filing of the statutory affidavit and the making of statutory proof of the inaccessibility of and\nefforts made to reach a resident judge, as provided by Art. 4643, are not void. If the Legislature had intended that such orders\nshould be void, there would have been no point in providing in the Article for a dissolution of writs granted in the absence of\nsuch affidavit and proof, with the burden placed on the person enjoined to prove facts entitling him to dissolution. Moreover,\nsignificance may be attached to legislative elimination from the article in the 1925 codification of all express language indicating\nthat in the absence of the required affidavit a nonresident judge would have no power to act.\n\n [9] [10] The requirement of Article 4643 for affidavit and proof before a nonresident judge is authorized to grant a writ\nand the requirement of Article 4656 for making writs returnable to and triable in the county of residence of the defendant are\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Violation of the requirements of the two statutes may be corrected at very little\nexpense and in a very brief time through orderly channels of procedure. There is no showing in the record before us that relators\nsought to have the restraining order dissolved or opposed the granting of the writ of temporary injunction on the ground that\nthe granting of such relief was violative of Arts. 4643 and 4656. Judgments which are rendered without observance of statutory\nrequirements which are purely procedural are not void, however irregular or erroneous they may be. 25 Tex.Jur. 809-812,\nJudgments, s 308; Freeman v. Freeman, Tex.Sup., 327 S.W.2d 428.\n\n [11] *235 Neither was the order granting the writ of temporary injunction void because no new bond was required of or filed\nby Damron and Gruber. We recognize the rule to be that a writ of temporary injunction is void when no bond is required and\nfiled as required by Rule 684, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Lancaster v. Lancaster, 155 Tex. 528, 291 S.W.2d 303. This is\nnot such a case. A bond was required and filed as a prerequisite to the granting of the restraining order. The order granting the\nwrit of temporary injunction continued the restraining order bond in full force and effect as a temporary injunction bond.\n\n [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] In asserting that the order and the writ were void relators rely on San Felipe Independent School\nDist. v. Nelson, Tex.Civ.App., 74 S.W.2d 136, 138, no writ history, in which the San Antonio Court of Civil Appeals expressly\nstated that a restraining order bond could not be substituted for the bond required by law for the issuance of a writ of temporary\ninjunction. On the other hand, the Dallas Court of Civil Appeals has held that when a restraining order is continued in force,\neven in part, the restraining order bond remains in force and effect as a temporary injunction bond. Porter v. Guggenheim,\nTex.Civ.App., 107 S.W.2d 891, 892, writ dismissed. Rule 684 requires that a restraining order or temporary injunction bond be\nconditioned **292 ‘that the applicant will abide the decision which may be made in the cause, and that he will pay all sums\nof money and costs which may be adjudged against him if the restraining order or temporary injunction shall be dissolved in\nwhole or in part.’ In the restraining order bond the signers obligated themselves to ‘abide the decision’ which might be made\nin the suit, and that was a continuing obligation until the suit was finally disposed of. Their other obligation was to pay all\nsums of money and costs which might be adjudged against them if the restraining order should be dissolved in whole or in part.\nIn granting a writ of temporary injunction upon expiration of the restraining order, the trial court should have required a new\nbond with new contractual obligations, but we know of no reason why, with the signers of a restraining order bond before it\nand agreeing, the court could not extend the bond and the second obligation of its signers to comply with Rule 684. There is\nnothing in the record before us to show that that did not occur. In support of the validity of the court's order and the writ we\nwill presume it did occur. 25 Tex.Jur. 830, Judgments, s 319. If the written terms of the bond on file did not then truly reflect\nthe full statutory obligations of the signers, the bond could have been amended or corrected, upon motion, to afford relators\nfull protection. *236 Mansfield v. Ramsey, Tex.Civ.App., 196 S.W. 330, no writ history; Lindley v. Easley, Tex.Civ.App.,\n59 S.W.2d 927, 929, no writ history. In the latter case the court said that ‘the failure to require a bond in a sufficient amount\nwould not render the injunction void and authorize its disobedience with impunity.’ The same may be said of the failure of the\nbond to correctly express one of the obligations of the signers. See also 24-A Tex.Jur. 255, Injunctions, s 160.\n\n\nThe relators are remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Sterling County there to remain until discharged according to the\nterms of the trial court's judgment.\n\nGRIFFIN, Justice (dissenting).\n\nI agree with the result reached in the majority opinion that the temporary injunction issued by Judge Mays was not void, but\nvoidable and irregular. This was a matter that could have been corrected by a prompt appeal under the provisions of Art. 4662,\nVernon's Ann.Tex.Civ.Stats.\n\nI disagree that the injunction was not void by virtue of the fact that the order of the judge did not require a bond to be given\nand no amount was fixed for the bond.\n\nIt is not disputed that the only bond in the record is the bond given to secure the temporary restraining order. It contains\nno provisions that secure the issuance of a temporary injunction, or protect anyone by virtue of the issuance of a temporary\ninjunction. In fact, it was issued ten days prior to the hearing on the issuance of a temporary injunction.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The life\nof that restraining order is specifically stated to be ‘operative until and pending the hearing below ordered.’ The hearing was\nordered for 10:00 a. m. on June 8, 1959 in the District Courtroom of Sterling County, Texas in Sterling City. The court ordered\na bond given before the District Clerk should issue the restraining order. By virtue of its own provisions and also by Rule\n680, Tex.Rules Civ.Proc., and innumerable cases, this restraining order expired June 8, 1959 and was of no further force and\neffect. *237 Fort Worth Street Railway Company v. Rosedale Street Railway Company, 1887, 68 Tex. 163, 7 S.W. 381;\nRiggins v. Thompson, 1902, 96 Tex. 154, 71 S.W. 14; Cole v.

Rotge, Tex.Civ.App.1935, 85 S.W.2d 650(2, 3), no writ history; 24-A Tex.Jur. 24.\n\n **293 It is true, as declared by the majority, that a temporary restraining order is a species of injunction. The above authorities\nand others hold that it is a separate and distinct order from either a temporary injunction or a permanent and perpetual injunction.\nThe Rules of Civil Procedure recognize that fact for Rule 680 deals only with such restraining order.\n\nRule 684 also recognizes such fact. That rule provides that ‘in the order granting any temporary restraining order or temporary\ninjunction, the court shall fix the amount of security to be given by the applicant. Before the issuance of the temporary restraining\norder or temporary injunction * * *; if the restraining order or temporary injunction shall be dissolved * * *; where the temporary\nrestraining order or temporary injunction is against the State * * * the liability of the applicant shall be for its face amount if\nthe restraining order or temporary injunction shall be dissolved * * *’. (Emphases added) It is apparent from the above wording\nin Rule 684 that the two species of injunction are separate and distinct.\n\nRule 685 continues this distinction between the two types of injunctive relief by using the following language: ‘Upon the grant\nof a temporary restraining order or an order fixing a time for hearing upon an application for a temporary injunction * * *’. Rule\n686 further carries forward this distinction. This Rule makes a difference in the form of citations to be issued in the temporary\nrestraining order and temporary injunction. Rule 688 also recognizes this difference.\n\nThe order entered June 18, 1959 reciting a hearing and judgment of June 8, 1959 nowhere continues the restraining order, nor\ndoes it mention the restraining order except where the court provides the restraining order bond shall be extended to cover the\ntemporary injunction. I say the court had no right to so order. The temporary restraining order expired and was of no further\nforce and effect. Riggins v. Thompson, supra, and other authorities therein cited. When the restraining order expired *238 the\nbond expired with it. The only case in Texas which I have been able to find in point holds that a temporary restraining order bond\ncannot be continued as a bond for a temporary injunction. San Felipe Independent School Dist. v. Nelson, Tex.Civ.App.1934,\n74 S.W.2d 136, 138, no writ history. In that case the San Antonio Court of Civil Appeals had held in their original opinion that\nsuch bond could be continued in force and effect. On rehearing they changed their holding and said:\n          ‘We wish to expressly state that we were in error in our original disposition of this cause wherein we held\n          that the bond given in connection with the issuing of the temporary restraining order might be substituted\n          for the bond required by law for the issuing of a temporary injunction. This, of course, cannot be done.’\n\n\n\nThe case of Porter v. Guggengeim, Tex.Civ.App.1937, 107 S.W.2d 891, wr. dism., is not in point on the question here before\nus. In that case the trial court had continued the restraining order in part. The Dallas Court of Civil Appeals rested its holding\nthat the bond could be used as a bond for the temporary injunction. That court said, ‘on the hearing, (for temporary injunction)\nthe court continued the restraining order, in part at least, as a temporary injunction, and the bond likewise continued in force\nand effect.’ (2), 2nd. col., at page 892. In our case, as pointed out above, the judge made no such order. He did not mention\nthe temporary restraining order at all, except as to the bond.\n\nThe effect of the majority opinion is to subject the surety on the temporary restraining order bond to new and additional liabilities\nfor which it did not contract when signing the original bond. It also overlooks the plain provision of the first sentence of Rule 684\n‘in the order granting any temporary restraining order or temporary injunction, the court shall fix the **294 amount of security\nto be given by the applicant.’ (Emphasis added) The trial court did not comply with this provision as no bond was set or given for\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

No surety nor sureties have bound themselves for liability under the temporary injunction; nor does\nthe record show any agreement on the part of the sureties on the restraining order bond to be bound for the temporary injunction.\n\nI believe the trial court had no right or authority to make the surety liable for more than it contracted in its original undertaking,\n *239 and, therefore, I believe the temporary injunction is absolutely void. I would discharge relators.\n\n\nHAMILTON, J., joins in this dissent.\n\nParallel Citations\n\n328 S.W.2d 283\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Emphasis ours throughout.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                       © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

St. art. 7047c-1, and Vernon's Ann. P. C. art. 131c-1). He then alleged that defendants George H.\nSheppard and his **718 deputies, including relator, were charged with the enforcement of the various provisions of that law.\n\nPlaintiff alleged that he was engaged in the business of selling cigarettes exclusively and solely in interstate commerce; that\nhis principal place of business was at Neosho, Mo., where he kept his office, warehouse, stock of cigarettes, etc.; and that\nthe manner of doing business was as follows: That he made his purchase of cigarettes in wholesale quantities; that they were\nshipped in interstate commerce to Neosho, Mo., and there held by him in stock; that he had one or more general salesmen in the\nstate of Texas and other solicitors and salesmen who worked under the supervision of the general salesmen; that his solicitors\nobtained orders from various persons within the state of Texas for cigarettes to be shipped from the stock held at Neosho, Mo.,\nwhich orders were forwarded to the general salesmen, who in turn sent them to the office at Neosho, Mo., for approval; that\nafter orders were accepted in this way the cigarettes were put in separate lots or packages according to the individual orders and\neach separate lot labeled with the name of the particular purchaser; that after the orders were filled in this manner, the cigarettes\nwere forwarded in one bulk shipment to the general salesmen, who then turned over to the salesmen the separate orders of\nthe various purchases, and these salesmen delivered same to the purchasers; that upon delivery of same the purchase money\nwas paid by the purchaser to the solicitor and was then forwarded to the office at Neosho, Mo. It is also shown that when the\ncigarettes were finally delivered to the purchasers and payment made, plaintiff had completely and finally parted with title to\nsame and had nothing further to do with them.\n\nPlaintiff alleged that although his bisiness as above conducted and the cigarettes sold by him in this manner were not subject\nto any of the provisions of the Cigarette Tax Law, being entirely within interstate commerce, nevertheless the Comptroller and\nhis assistants were seeking and attempting to make the provisions of the law applicable to him and to his business, and were in\nvarious ways interfering with him in the *63 conduct of his business by attempting to make applicable said law and to collect\nthe taxes therein provided for upon cigarettes handled by him. Allegations were made of several specific acts on the part of\nthe Comptroller and his assistants, including threats of prosecution against solicitors and salesmen, in an effort to make him\nand his business subject to provisions of the law.\n\nThe constitutionality of the Cigarette Tax Law was attacked on many grounds not necessary to mention here. Among other\nthings, it is alleged that the Comptroller ‘seeks to extend the terms of its prohibitions and penalties to persons and consumers\nbuying in interstate commerce, and thereby destroying, crippling and overthrowing the lawful business of your petitioner,\nby inculcating in the minds of the purchasers who buy from petitioner in interstate commerce that purchases under such\ncircumstances are criminal in their nature and violative of the terms of this act, and expose such purchasers and consumers so\nbuying from your petitioner to the pains, penalties and punishment of the law; and that the effect of such act and the extension of\nits penalties and prohibitions to such purchasers, customers and patrons is to deny to your petitioner the right under the Federal\nand State Constitutions, to conduct his business through the avenues of interstate commerce, and to lawfully sell to purchasers\ndesiring to consume his cigarettes such tobacco commodities, all of which is contrary to the interstate commerce clause of the\nFederal Constitution hereinbefore set out, and is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, in that it\nseeks to deprive the petitioner of his rights, his property and his liberty without due process of law; and by liberty as herein\nmeant is the liberty to pursue a lawful calling in and under the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Federal\nConstitution hereinbefore mentioned.’\n\nPlaintiff prayed for a restraining order to continue until such time as a hearing might be had for a temporary injunction and\nthat finally he be awarded a permanent injunction against the Comptroller and other defendants including relator. As the\ntemporary restraining order followed almost verbatim the language of the prayer in the petition, we set out the restraining portion\nthereof. Among other things, the defendants were commanded to ‘desist and refrain from harassing and annoying petitioner,\nhis agents, and servants in the prosecution and conduct of such interstate business as aforesaid, and commanding and *64\n **719 enjoining them to refrain from arresting and criminally prosecuting, under the Act aforesaid, your petitioner his agents,\nservants and employees, in the conduct of such interstate trade, and commanding and enjoining the said defendants and each of\nthem, their agents, servants and employees, to desist and refrain from seizing and confiscating the goods and commodities of\nyour petitioner, shipped in interstate commerce, and commanding said defendants, and each of them, their agents, servants and\nemployees, from wrecking the business of the petitioner by proclaiming to the general public that the purchase of petitioner's\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It was especially provided that the defendants should appear at 9 o'clock a. m. on August 1, 1935, and show cause why\na temporary injunction should not issue. On September 21, 1935, plaintiff Klugsberg filed in the district court a motion for\ncontempt as to defendants George H. Sheppard and relator Kimberlin. It is unnecessary to set out the various acts alleged to\nconstitute the contempt, as it was later found by the court that only one of them constituted a contempt.\n\nThe motion was set for hearing on September 26, 1935, before Judge Sarah T. Hughes, judge of the district court of the\nFourteenth judicial district, who had caused the restraining order to be issued, and relator was properly served with notice. On\nthe day set for hearing he appeared in person and by attorneys, and after full hearing upon the facts, relator was adjudged to be\nin contempt of court. The judgment of the court in this regard is as follows: ‘* * * But as to the said Sam Kimberlin, however,\nit is the opinion of the court, and the court so finds, that he, on *65 the 20th day of September, 1935, in willful violation of\nthe orders of the court referred to above, seized the quantity of cigarettes as described in the pleadings and testimony of the\nwitnesses from one Barrett, who had purchased same on a standing order, and from one Keys, who had purchased on regular\norder; and the court finds that acts of said Kimberlin were and are an interference with the previous orders of the court in this\ncase, and that said transactions with the said Barrett and the said Keys were interstate commerce between them and the plaintiff\nherein, and the court finds that the said Kimberlin by reason of the premises is in active contempt.’\n [1] [2] It is elementary that a habeas corpus proceeding in this court constitutes a collateral attack upon the judgment of\ncontempt in the lower court, and a writ of habeas corpus cannot be made to take the place of an appeal, certiorari, quo warranto,\nor writ of error. In such a proceeding as this the court cannot give relief unless the restraining order by the district judge, or the\njudgment of contempt or the writ of commitment thereunder, is absolutely void; and such voidness must be solely because of\nlack of jurisdiction. Ex parte Smith, 110 Tex. 55, 214 S. W. 320; Ex parte Lipscomb, 111 Tex. 409, 239 S. W. 1101; Ex parte\nOlson, 111 Tex. 601, 243 S. W. 773, 777; Lytle v. Ry. Co., 41 Tex. Civ. App. 112, 90 S. W. 316.\n\n [3] Relator apparently recognized this rule, but attempts to justify his action in violating the restraining order on the ground that\nthe court was wholly without jurisdiction to issue same and to restrain interference with purchasers of cigarettes from plaintiff\nKlugsberg by demanding of them payment of the cigarette tax provided for by H. B. No. 755; and was likewise without power\nto adjudge him in contempt for violating that portion of the order which sought to restrain him from confiscating cigarettes sold\nto Barrett and Keys by plaintiff. However, no contention is made that the district court did not have jurisdiction of the cause of\naction and of the parties. Nor can it be plausibly contended that the court did not have **720 power to issue the writ in order\nto accomplish some of the purposes therein mentioned. Apparently it is not contended that the business being conducted by\nplaintiff Klugsberg up to the time the cigarettes were delivered to the purchasers was not interstate business within the decisions\nof our federal courts. The court undoubtedly had the right to protect plaintiff and his business from some of the acts sought to\nbe *66 restrained by the writ. This being true, it is evident that the writ was not wholly void for want of jurisdiction, but at\nthe most was only voidable as to some of the acts sought to be restrained. In Ex parte Olson, supra, the court said: ‘The district\ncourt clearly had jurisdiction of relator and the subject-matter of the suit, and the injunction issued, therefore, cannot be said to\nbe absolutely void.’ The court cited Lytle v. Ry. Co., 41 Tex. Civ. App. 112, 90 S. W. 316, 317, wherein it was said: ‘Until we\ncome to consider and determine the questions involved in the appeal, we must observe the rule that, in proceedings for contempt\nin failing to obey an order of court, the respondent may question the order which he is charged with refusing to obey, only in\nso far as he can show it to be absolutely void, and cannot be heard to say that it is erroneous, however flagrant it may appear to\nbe. If the district court had jurisdiction of the parties and the matter adjudicated, the injunction cannot be said to be absolutely\nvoid. ‘Jurisdiction,’ in the sense here used does not mean simple jurisdiction of the particular case occupying the attention of\nthe court, but jurisdiction of the class of cases to which the particular case belongs. It is sufficient, in a proceeding like this,\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               4\n\fEx parte Kimberlin, 126 Tex. 60 (1935)\n86 S.W.2d 717\n\nthat the case belongs to a general class over which the authority of the trial court extends. If it does, then jurisdiction attaches,\nand is not lost because of an erroneous decision, however erroneous it may be. O'Brien v. People (216 Ill. 354), 75 N. E. (108),\n109 (108 Am. St. Rep. 219, 3 Ann. Cas. 966). The case in which the decree appealed from was one of injunction-the class over\nwhich the court that rendered it had unquestionable original jurisdiction.'\n\n [4] [5] We are decidedly of the opinion that even though plaintiff Klugsberg was engaged in interstate commerce, yet when\nthe cigarettes were finally delivered by the salesmen to the respective purchasers and the purchase money was paid to the\nsalesmen, they ceased to be in interstate commerce and became a proper subject for taxation under the provisions of the Cigarette\nLaw. The correct rule is reflected by such cases as Waring v. Mayor, etc., of Mobile, 8 Wall. (75 U. S.) 110, 19 L. Ed. 342, and\nFuqua v. Pabst Brewing Co., 90 Tex. 298, 38 S. W. 29, 750, 35 L. R. A. 241. It becomes immaterial to determine here whether\nthe tax after the cigarettes were delivered to the purchasers was to be collected on the sale or on the consumption of same, as\nthis is a matter wholly between the purchaser and the officers of the state. Even if the attempt by the Comptroller and his *67\nassociates to lay the tax on the purchaser had an indirect effect upon the business of plaintiff (which we do not find it necessary\nto decide), this furnishes no ground for injunctive relief on his part. This is not a case of interference with business by reason\nof willful threats and intimidations, but the alleged interference results from a bona fide effort to enforce the tax laws of this\nstate; and such acts cannot be held to be such an interference with the business of plaintiff as to justify relief by injunction. It is\nadmitted that when the cigarettes were delivered to the purchaser and the purchase money paid, plaintiff had no further interest\nin them or in the transaction by which the sale was effected.\n\n\nNotwithstanding, however, the district judge was in error in holding that the cigarettes were still in interstate commerce and\nnotwithstanding the fact that the judge and notwithstanding the fact that the judgc erroneously held relator in contempt because\nhe confiscated the cigarettes after being delivered to the purchasers, yet we are of the opinion that the action of the court in\nthis regard was an error of judgment upon the law and facts, and was not absolutely void because of lack of jurisdiction. Upon\nthis point the cases of Ex parte Testard, 101 Tex. 250, 106 S. W. 319, Ex parte Warfield, 40 Tex. Cr. R. 413, 50 S. W. 933,\n938, 76 Am St. Rep. 724, and Ex parte Olson, supra, appear to be in point. In Ex parte Roper, 61 Tex. Cr. R. 68, 134 S. W.\n334, 338, it was said: ,‘Again, it is urged as grounds of release that the writ of injunction goes beyond the power of the court to\nrestrain appellant from the unlawful use of property and to engage in unlawful sales, but effectually restrains him from selling\nunder prescription and in accordance with the law. It may be conceded that the writ, as issued, goes beyond the prayer in the\npetition for injunction, **721 and beyond the precise limits authorized by law. This would not, however, render the injunction\ngranted absolutely void, but, so far as the court was authorized to issue an injunction, it would and should be upheld. This, as\nwe understand, was directly held by our Supreme Court in Ex parte Testard, 101 Tex. 250, 106 S. W. 319.’\n [6] In this connection we observe that relator had a speedy and effective remedy, easily available, to which he could have\nresorted and by which he could have no doubt removed the objectionable features from the writ long before he violated same\non September 20th. We think it was clearly his duty to file motion before the court to modify the restraining order, *68 and\nin the event he failed in that regard, to insist upon a prompt hearing to determine whether or not a temporary or permanent\ninjunction should issue. In the event a temporary or permanent injunction was issued, he had a speedy remedy by appeal to the\nCourt of Civil Appeals. It will be noted that the original order of the court directed the cause to be set for hearing at 9 o'clock\na. m. August 1st, which was only two days after the restraining order was issued. The judgment of contempt shows that by\nagreement of the parties the hearing was continued from day to day and the restraining order kept in force until it was violated\nby relator on September 20th. Thus it is seen that instead of moving to modify or dissolve the writ, and instead of seeking to\nhave a hearing on same, relator appears to have fully acquiesced in the action of the court until the 20th of September. If the\nrestraining order was too broad and included matters of doubtful validity, it was clearly the duty of relator to obey same and\nto seek a modification or dissolution. The language of the Court of Criminal Appeals in the case of Ex parte Warfield, supra,\nappears to be appropriate here. In that case it was said:\n‘It has been said that applicant was not shown to have violated the spirit of the injunction, inasmuch as no conversation was\nshown of a character calculated to persuade or lead away the wife of plaintiff; but his conduct was certainly in violation of\nthe letter of said injunction, and we cannot say that the court did not have the right and authority to make the injunction as\nbroad as it did, as, under the allegations of the petition, it is shown that defendant was not to be trusted in the society of Mrs.\nMorris, or to speak with her.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The defendant in that suit had his right to invoke the action of that court ot dissolve\nthat injunction. He did not do so, but he saw fit to willfully disregard it, and he now claims before this court that the same was\nabsolutely void, and that he had the right to defy it and set it at naught. It occurs to us that the injunction could have been easily\nobeyed, without infringing upon any of the fundamental rights of the applicant.’\n\n\n\n\nThe necessity for appropriate action to obtain relief by motion to modify, or by the usual processes afforded by resort to the\ncourt where the cause is pending, is clearly recognized by the court in the case of Ex parte *69 Travis, 123 Tex. 480, 73 S.W.\n(2d) 487, 489, in an able opinion by Justice Greenwood.\n [7] Relator contends, however, that the writ was void in all particulars because it was an attempt to prevent enforcement of\nthe criminal laws of this state. This was obviously not an attempt to interfere with the orderly administration of the law. It was\nmerely for the purpose of holding the situation in status quo until the court could consider and pass upon the various contentions\npresented by the petition. As is shown above, an opportunity was afforded for a prompt hearing and relator evidently did not\nconsider the action of the court as seriously interfering with the administration of the law, because he waited some fifty days\nwithout attempting to modify the order or have a hearing thereon, and then violated the writ.\n\n\nThe order granting temporary writ of habeas corpus is set aside, and the relator is remanded to the custody of the sheriff of\nDallas county.\n\nOpinion adopted by the Supreme Court.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n86 S.W.2d 717\n\nEnd of Document                                                        © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The various defendants settled with Cantu,\nand Fortis looked only to Cantu for its recovery. A divided court of appeals upheld a trial court finding that because Cantu's\nmedical expenses exceeded the settlement amount plus the benefits Fortis had paid, Fortis's subrogation claim was barred by the\nequitable “made whole” doctrine. We hold that the “made whole” doctrine must yield to Fortis's right to contractual subrogation\nunder the plain terms of the insurance policy.\n\n\n\n                                                         I. Background\n\nCantu suffered severe injuries in a car wreck and later sued the driver of the vehicle in which she was riding, his employer, the\nvehicle seller, and the vehicle manufacturer (Ford). Fortis intervened and asserted contractual subrogation and reimbursement\nrights to recoup from Cantu's tort recovery the amount of medical benefits it had paid under the policy. At a pretrial conference,\nFortis agreed with all parties on the record that Fortis was excused from participating in the pretrial and trial proceedings and\nthat Fortis at the post-verdict phase would look only to Cantu to resolve its subrogation and reimbursement claims.\n\nCantu settled her claims with the defendants before trial for $1.445 million. Cantu and Fortis disputed what portion of the\nsettlement proceeds, if any, should go to Fortis, and Cantu moved for summary judgment, arguing she had not been “made\nwhole” by the settlement. Cantu's past medical expenses totaled $378,500 (of which Fortis claimed to have paid $247,534.14),\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 965\n\nand her summary judgment evidence included two “life care plans” estimating her future medical expenses at roughly $1.7\nmillion and $5.3 million. She argued that her past and future medical expenses, exclusive of other amounts like pain and\nsuffering, exceeded the amount of the settlement plus what Fortis had already paid. Cantu argued that the “made whole” doctrine\nprecluded Fortis's contractual claims of subrogation and reimbursement. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of\nCantu, and a divided court of appeals affirmed. 1\n\n\n\n                                      II. Subrogation and the “Made Whole” Doctrine\n\nThis Court recognized the “made whole” doctrine twenty-seven years ago in Ortiz v. Great Southern Fire & Casualty Insurance\nCo. 2 The Ortiz family had a fire insurance policy from Great Southern on their home, but not the contents. 3 A fire caused\ndamages of $4,000 to the home and $11,614 to personal property, and Great Southern paid $4,000 for home repairs. 4 The\nOrtizes then sued Stacy–Mason, Inc., alleging that one of its employees negligently started the fire. Great Southern intervened,\nclaiming a right of equitable *645 subrogation. 5 After the Ortizes settled with Stacy–Mason for $10,000, the trial court\nawarded, and the court of appeals affirmed, $4,000 of that settlement to Great Southern. 6\n\nWe reversed, holding, “An insurer is not entitled to subrogation if the insured's loss is in excess of the amounts recovered from\nthe insurer and the third party causing the loss.” 7 We reasoned that one justification for equitable subrogation is to prevent the\ninsured from receiving a double recovery, first from the insurer, then from the third party. 8 We also recognized, however, that\nif the insured's total recovery is less than his or her losses, equity cuts the other way: “when ‘either the insurer or the insured\nmust to some extent go unpaid, the loss should be borne by the insurer for that is a risk the insured has paid it to assume.’ ” 9\nBecause the settlement in Ortiz encompassed both covered and noncovered items, we remanded for a determination of how\nmuch of the $10,000 related to house damage. 10\n\n [1] Ortiz would govern if Fortis were merely asserting a claim for equitable subrogation. But Fortis is not citing principles of\nequity to recover its money; its policy with Cantu conferred on Fortis two separate contractual rights of recovery, one styled\n“subrogation” and one styled “reimbursement.” 11 Fortis argues that these provisions authorize recovery from Cantu's $1.445\nmillion settlement with the defendants, and that neither provision is displaced by the “made whole” doctrine. We agree.\n\n\n\n                                   A. Equitable Subrogation v. Contractual Subrogation\n\nOur Ortiz decision addressed the “made whole” doctrine in the context of equitable subrogation, but it did not discuss how\nthe doctrine applies, if at all, to contractual subrogation. Other courts, however, have discussed whether the doctrine applies\nin the face of a contract that grants the insurer greater subrogation rights. For example, in Oss v. United Services Automobile\n *646 Ass'n, 12 the Fifth Circuit, applying Texas law in a diversity case, was confronted with facts similar to those in this\ncase. The insured was not made whole by the settlement following a car wreck, yet insurer USAA sought enforcement of\nits contractual subrogation rights under the policy. 13 Like Fortis, USAA urged the Fifth Circuit to reject the “made whole”\ndoctrine by distinguishing Ortiz as involving equitable rather than contractual subrogation. 14 The Fifth Circuit, relying on the\nEl Paso Court of Appeals' decision in Means v. United Fidelity Life Insurance Co., refused because it believed that, in Texas,\n“the same principles govern both equitable and contractual subrogation.” 15\n\nIn Means, the insureds had challenged the validity of United Fidelity's contractual subrogation right to foreclose on their 200–\nacre property. 16 The court noted, “Whether we have a purely equitable subrogation or, as here, a purely contractual one where\nboth Mr. and Mrs. Means agreed to the subrogation, the principles are the same, and the rights of United Fidelity Life Insurance\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 965\n\nCompany after the payment were superior to the homestead rights of Mr. and Mrs. Means.” 17 Read in context, the court's\ndiscussion in Means does little more than affirm a subrogee's basic rights, whether they arise via contract or equity. Moreover,\nMeans nowhere addressed the “made whole” doctrine that we first articulated in Ortiz, nor could it have, since Ortiz was decided\nthree years later. When the El Paso Court of Appeals declared in Means that “the principles are the same” in contractual and\nequitable subrogation, it did so against a legal landscape that did not yet include the “made whole” doctrine. 18 For this reason,\nMeans is not particularly instructive, nor is Oss, which relies predominantly on Means.\n\nOther Texas courts of appeals have addressed the difference between equitable and contractual subrogation. For example, the\nAustin Court of Appeals in Lexington Insurance Co. v. Gray recognized the distinction between “legal” and “conventional”\nsubrogation. 19 The former is governed by equity; the latter by contract. 20 The court (1) observed that Texas courts have\ngiven “substance to the distinction,” (2) noted the “unusually ‘hospitable’ treatment that the right of subrogation has historically\nreceived in Texas,” especially express subrogation agreements, which are given “considerable weight” and are governed by\ngeneral contract law principles, 21 and (3) cited several cases holding that a subrogee invoking contractual subrogation can\n“recover without regard to the relative equities of the parties.” 22 Lexington did not specifically *647 involve the “made\nwhole” doctrine we had adopted a decade earlier in Ortiz, but it suggested that this equitable defense would not apply in the\nface of an express agreement whereby the parties agree in advance that the matter will be governed by contract principles rather\nthan equitable principles. Where the policy's terms govern subrogation, the court added, “there is no reason for the equitable\nprinciples usually found in subrogation cases to come into play.” 23\n\n\nA few years later, however, in Esparza v. Scott & White Health Plan, 24 the Austin Court of Appeals backed away from this\ninterpretation. The Esparzas settled for an amount that did not make them whole, and Scott and White sought subrogation under\nan express provision in the parties' insurance contract, citing Lexington as holding that the “made whole” doctrine should apply\nonly to equitable subrogation and not to contractual subrogation. 25 The court of appeals disagreed, stating:\n\n\n  The distinction we drew between legal and conventional subrogation in Lexington simply means that under conventional\n  subrogation no balancing of equities is necessary to determine whether the subrogee has a right to recover at all. While an\n  insurance contract providing expressly for subrogation may remove from the realm of equity the question of whether the\n  insurer has a right to subrogation, it cannot answer the question of when the insurer is actually entitled to subrogation or\n  how much it should receive....\n\n     ... To avoid injustice, the equities must still be balanced in deciding what amount, if any, the subrogee is entitled to receive\n    in a given case. 26\nThe court adopted the reasoning from Oss that a boiler-plate subrogation provision does not automatically negate an insurance\npolicy's fundamental purpose, which is to protect the insured by shifting the risk of loss to the insurer. 27 If anyone is to go\nunpaid, the court reasoned, it should be the insurance company. The court concluded that contracts “ ‘confirm, but [do] not\nexpand, the equitable subrogation rights of insurers,’ ” and the equities must still be balanced to achieve justice. 28\n\n [2] We do not disagree that equitable and contractual subrogation rest upon common principles, but contract rights generally\narise from contract language; they do not derive their validity from principles of equity but directly from the parties' agreement.\nThe policy declares the parties' rights and obligations, which are not generally supplanted by court-fashioned equitable rules\nthat might apply, as a default gap-filler, in the absence of a valid contract. If subrogation arises independent of any contract,\nthen an express subrogation agreement would be superfluous and serve only to acknowledge this preexisting right, a position\nwe reject. 29\n\n[3] Contractual subrogation clauses express the parties' intent that reimbursement should be controlled by agreed contract\n*648 terms rather than external rules imposed by the courts. The United States Supreme Court addressed this very point in a\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 965\n\nsubrogation case decided shortly after we granted the instant case. In Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 30 insurer\nMid Atlantic was an ERISA plan fiduciary for the Sereboffs. When the Sereboffs were injured in an auto accident, Mid Atlantic\npaid the couple's expenses pursuant to the plan. 31 When the Sereboffs settled the tort claims that arose from the accident, Mid\nAtlantic filed suit under ERISA to collect the medical expenses it had paid. 32 Mid Atlantic sought reimbursement under an\n“Acts of Third Parties” provision in the plan. 33 The Sereboffs argued that the equitable defense of the “made whole” doctrine\nshould apply, even though language in the plan document was to the contrary. 34 The Court disagreed, comparing an action\nunder the “Acts of Third Parties” provision to an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement. 35 The Court\nrefused to apply the “made whole” doctrine, deeming the Sereboffs' equitable defenses “beside the point” because Mid Atlantic's\nsubrogation claims arose by written agreement. 36\n\n\nThis position was earlier adopted by the Fifth Circuit in another ERISA case, Walker v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. 37 That case,\nlike today's case, concerned a subrogation clause that granted a right of recovery against “any and all” third-party settlements.\nWalker brought a malpractice action against her dentist, alleging he propped open her mouth excessively, resulting in three\njaw surgeries and medical expenses of over $41,000. 38 Walker settled for $12,500, and the trial court awarded the insurer\nthe entire settlement amount as first-money reimbursement for the medical benefits it paid. 39 The Fifth Circuit held that “the\nPlan's language is unambiguous.... We agree with the district court in holding that the ‘any and all’ language plainly means\nthe first dollar of recovery (any) and 100% recovery (all) of the funds received by the plaintiff in the settlement, up to the full\namount of the benefits paid.” 40\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The three varieties of subrogation—equitable, contractual, and statutory—represent three separate\nand distinct rights that, while related, are independent of each other. Independent, however, does not mean co-equal. We\ngenerally adhere to the maxim that “equity follows the law,” which requires equitable doctrines to conform to contractual\nand statutory mandates, not the other way around. Where a valid contract prescribes particular *649 remedies or imposes\nparticular obligations, equity generally must yield unless the contract violates positive law or offends public policy. This\nCourt has “long recognized a strong public policy in favor of preserving the freedom of contract.” 41 And in Texas Ass'n of\nCounties County Government Risk Management Pool v. Matagorda County, we emphasized that insurers are well equipped to\nevaluate and reduce risk by, for example, “drafting policies to specifically provide for reimbursement.” 42 Fortis did exactly that,\ndrafting two separate recovery provisions that replaced equitable rights with specific contractual rights. Neither subrogation nor\nreimbursement clauses violate Texas public policy. 43 As we have stated, “ ‘the State's public policy is reflected in its statutes,’\n” 44 and Texas workers' compensation law specifically embraces an insurer's first-money right of subrogation, thus indicating\nno blanket legislative disfavor of such provisions. 45 It is indeed difficult to declare something contrary to public policy when\nstate law, both statutory and regulatory, actually suggests approval. 46 In a subrogation case arising under the Labor Code, the\nAmarillo Court of Appeals distinguished statutory subrogation from equitable and contractual subrogation. 47 The court looked\nonly at the statute's plain language in affirming the trial court's refusal to invoke its equitable powers to deny subrogation. 48\nWe agree with this modest, text-based approach.\n\n [9] Given this insurance policy's plain language, we are loathe to judicially rewrite the parties' contract by engrafting extra-\ncontractual standards that neither the Legislature nor the Texas Department of Insurance has thus far decided to promulgate. As\nwe have said before, balancing dueling policy concerns is generally for non-judicial bodies, and it remains the “better policy\nfor the contracts of insurance to be changed by the public body charged with their supervision, the State Board of Insurance,\nor by the Legislature, rather than for this Court” to contravene the express language of insurance contracts with equitable\narguments. 49 The *650 contrary, however—replacing equitable protections with specific contract language—is not unknown\nin Texas law. 50 Parties are thus free to negate the “made whole” doctrine contractually, and to do so before an event occurs\nthat triggers medical benefits under the policy. 51\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 965\n\n\n [10] [11] [12] Leading insurance law treatises likewise recognize that specific policy terms can override equitable principles\nand that many jurisdictions, though not all, apply the “made whole” doctrine only in the absence of contrary reimbursement\nlanguage in the contract. 52 We agree with those courts holding that contract-based subrogation rights should be governed by\nthe parties' express agreement and not invalidated by equitable considerations that might control by default in the absence of\nan agreement. 53\n\n\n\n                                B. Subrogation Under Cantu's Insurance Contract With Fortis\n\n [13] [14] We turn now to the specific language of the policy in issue, which defines the parties' rights and obligations. It\ncontains a section called “Recovery,” which includes a “Subrogation Right” provision and a separate (and broader) “Right\nof Reimbursement” provision. The former establishes a right of subrogation: “Upon payment of benefits, We [Fortis] will be\nsubrogated to all rights of recovery a Covered Person [Cantu] may have against any person or organization.” 54 The provision\ncontinues: “Such right extends to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment; but is limited to the amount of benefits We have\npaid.” 55 Fortis thus retained an unfettered right to recover the proceeds from *651 the settlement of the underlying suit, the\nonly limitation being the amount of recovery—what Fortis had paid under the contract. Nowhere does this provision suggest\nthat Cantu must first be “made whole” for Fortis to recover. This provision does not use the modifier “first money,” but its\nmeaning is not imprecise or ambiguous. The contract's specific language controls Fortis's right to subrogation, and the equitable\ndefense of the “made whole” doctrine must give way.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that Fortis is contractually entitled to recover from the $1.445 million settlement the total amount of\nbenefits it paid to Cantu. 56\n\n\n\n                                                III. Fortis's Claims Against Ford\n\n [15] [16] [17] Fortis also asserts that the court of appeals erred in not considering the validity of a pretrial agreement\nregarding its claims against defendant Ford. At a pretrial conference convened under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11, Fortis\nagreed to divide the proceeding into two phases: first Cantu would litigate the case with the defendants completely independent\nfrom Fortis, and then Fortis would look only to Cantu to resolve its claim for subrogation. The Rule 11 agreement and stipulations\nin the record, which narrowed the issues presented to the trial court, make clear that Fortis has unequivocally relinquished\nany claims against Ford. Just as Cantu entered into and is bound by the specific language in the insurance agreement, Fortis\nentered into and is bound by the specific language in the Rule 11 agreement. Rule 11 aims to remove misunderstandings and\ncontroversies that accompany verbal assurances, and the written agreements “speak for themselves.” 57 As this is a valid pretrial\nagreement under Rule 11, the trial court had a duty to enforce its terms. 58 Hence, the trial court did not err in dismissing Fortis's\nclaims against Ford, and the court of appeals did not err in affirming that portion of the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                          IV. Conclusion\n\n [18] The equitable “made whole” doctrine is inapplicable when the parties' agreed contract provides a clear and specific right\nof subrogation. Accordingly, while we affirm that part of the court of appeals' judgment regarding respondent Ford, we reverse\nand remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Our confined duty is to construe the contract as is, and holding that equitable considerations\n       trump contrary contract terms would render contractual subrogation a nullity.\n42     52 S.W.3d 128, 136 (Tex.2000). As we noted, “the presence of absence of a reimbursement clause in the insurance contract could\n       affect the premium charged,” so such provisions cannot be deemed illusory.

Even taking as true the contention that insurance contracts are contracts of adhesion that reflect unequal bargaining\n       power, “adhesion contracts are not automatically unconscionable or void.” In re Oakwood Mobile Homes, Inc., 987 S.W.2d 571,\n       574 (Tex.1999). Nor is it per se unconscionable that an insurer would seek to reduce its risk and boost its solvency by including a\n       subrogation and/or reimbursement clause. In any event, Cantu has produced no evidence of duress or unconscionability.\n54     Emphasis added. Although Cantu argues that this language is so open-ended it allows for subrogation of claims unrelated to the\n       policy, we must construe this provision in relation to the entire instrument, Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983), to avoid\n       an interpretation that renders the contract “unreasonable, inequitable, and oppressive,” Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc., 727 S.W.2d\n       527, 530 (Tex.1987). This contract is a “Major Medical Policy” that “describes the benefits available to You and covered Family\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REMEDIES CODE ANN. § 51.016 (West 2008). Gray Wireline\nService, Inc. complains that the trial court erred by reforming the employment agreements rather than sending those issues to\nbe determined by the arbitrator in contravention of the employment agreement and by refusing to stay the pending litigation in\nthe trial court. GWSI further complains that the trial court erred by granting a temporary injunction in favor of Steve Gray and\nCGN Leasing. Because *467 we find that the trial court erred by reforming the employment agreements but should have sent\nthat issue to arbitration, and erred by denying the motion to stay the litigation, we reverse the judgments of the trial court and\nremand to that court for further proceedings. Additionally, because we find that the temporary injunction did not comply with\nthe Rules of Civil Procedure, we reverse the order granting the temporary injunction and order that it be dissolved.\n\n\nBackground\nSteve Gray formed GWSI, a cased-hole wireline company, which operated primarily in Texas. In 2006, the shareholders of\nGWSI agreed to sell a portion of their shares to Centre Partners, Inc. and by doing so Centre Partners, Inc. gained control of\nGWSI. The new owners entered into employment agreements with Larry Cavanna, David Gray, Steve Gray, and Kenneth M.\nNester, Sr. 1 which each contained a non-compete clause that terminated at various times depending on the reasons for the\nindividual's departure, but was generally two years in duration. Each of the four departed from GWSI at various times, with\nNester being the last to leave, terminating his employment on August 15, 2009.\n\nGWSI originally filed suit in mid-October of 2009 against Larry Cavanna, David Gray, Steve Gray, Kenneth M. Nester,\nSr., Ismael Alvarez, Extreme Wireline Trucks & Equipment, LLC, Andrew E. Hughes, Bruce R. Barnett, and CGN Leasing,\nLLC seeking a temporary restraining order and asserting various causes of action based on violations of the employment\nagreement, including tortious interference, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment,\nunfair competition, violation of Penal Code Chapter 33, conversion, and trespass against the various defendants. The trial court\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             5\n\fGray Wireline Service, Inc. v. Cavanna, 374 S.W.3d 464 (2011)\n\n\nissued a temporary restraining order, which was subsequently extended by agreement of the parties so that they could conduct\nlimited expedited discovery. Shortly after the issuance of the temporary restraining order, Steve Gray and CGN Leasing, LLC\nfiled a demand for arbitration in accordance with Steve Gray's employment agreement, and included a cause of action for\na declaratory judgment in the arbitration demand. GWSI ultimately withdrew its request for a temporary injunction the day\nbefore the scheduled hearing. Cavanna, David Gray, and Nester then filed a “Motion to Reform and Alternate Motion for\nDetermination” seeking reformation of the non-compete clause pursuant to Section 15.51(c) of the Business and Commerce\nCode or alternatively a determination that they were in full compliance with the employment agreements. GWSI subsequently\nfiled its own demand for arbitration as to Steve Gray, Cavanna, David Gray, and Nester with the American Arbitration\nAssociation as well as a motion to stay the litigation pending the arbitration with the trial court.\n\nAfter a hearing on the motions, the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration relating to the motion to reform and by\nseparate order granted the motion to reform and reformed the employment agreements of Cavanna, David Gray, and Nester.\nThe trial court then granted the motion to compel arbitration but denied *468 the motion to stay the trial court's proceedings\npending the arbitration as to all of the defendants except for Cavanna, David Gray, Nester, Steve Gray, and CGN Leasing. The\ntrial court did stay the pending litigation against them until the completion of the arbitration.\n\n\nThe Non–Compete Agreements\nEach of the employment agreements contained the following language which Cavanna, Gray, and Nester sought to modify in\nthe motion to reform:\n\n  Geographic Limitation. The geographic limitation for the Non–Compete Obligations is any state, province (or substantially\n  equivalent designation of a geographic area within a foreign country), or Outer Continental Shelf region (A) in which the\n  Company provided its products, services, or activities during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of termination of\n  Executive's employment with the Company, (B) in which the Company had plans to provide or contemplated providing its\n  products, services, or activities during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of termination of Executive's employment,\n  or (C) in which a customer or client of the Company, with whom Executive had or made contact or had access to information\n  and/or files about during Executive's employment with the Company or within the twelve (12) months prior to the date of\n  termination of Executive's employment with the Company, is located.\n\n  Acknowledgments. Executive acknowledges and agrees that:\n\n  ...\n\n  (g) the restricted period set forth is a material term of this Agreement and that the Company is entitled to Executive's\n  compliance with these terms during that full period. Therefore, Executive agrees that the restricted period will be tolled\n  during any period of non-compliance by Executive. If the Company must seek injunctive relief or judicial intervention to\n  enforce this Agreement, the restricted time period set forth herein does not commence until Executive is judged by a court\n  of competent jurisdiction to be in full compliance with this Agreement;....\n\nThe trial court reformed the first paragraph to include the language “as evidenced by existing memoranda, minutes, or other\ncorrespondence (including, without limitation, internal or external presentations)” in paragraph (B) of the geographic restriction\nsection. The trial court also reformed the tolling paragraph to delete the last sentence and to add the following: “If the Company\nmust seek injunctive relief or judicial intervention to enforce this Agreement, the restricted time period set forth herein does\nnot commence until a court of competent jurisdiction deems it should commence.”\n\n\nArbitration\n [1] [2] [3] [4] In evaluating a motion to compel arbitration, a court must first determine whether a valid arbitration\nagreement exists, and then whether the agreement encompasses the claims raised.

Whether a valid\narbitration agreement exists is a legal question subject to de novo review. Id. Although the Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly\nexpressed a strong presumption favoring arbitration, the presumption arises only after the party seeking to compel arbitration\nproves that a valid arbitration agreement exists. J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 227 (Tex.2003). Courts must\nresolve any *469 doubts about an arbitration agreement's scope in favor of arbitration. In re FirstMerit Bank, N.A., 52 S.W.3d\n749, 753 (Tex.2001).\n\n [5] [6] [7] Arbitration agreements are interpreted under traditional contract principles. J.M. Davidson, 128 S.W.3d at 227.\nIf the trial court finds a valid agreement, the burden shifts to the party opposing arbitration to raise an affirmative defense to\nenforcing arbitration. Id. Absent a defense to enforcing the arbitration agreement, the trial court has no discretion but to compel\narbitration and stay its own proceedings. In re J.D. Edwards World Solutions Co., 87 S.W.3d 546, 549 (Tex.2002) (per curiam).\n\n [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] To determine whether an arbitration agreement covers a party's claims, a court must focus on the\ncomplaint's factual allegations, not the legal causes of action asserted. FirstMerit Bank, 52 S.W.3d at 754. See also Energy\nTransfer Fuel, LP v. Estate of Souter, No. 10–09–00361–CV, 2010 WL 1611082, at *2–3, 2010 Tex.App. LEXIS 2975 at *6–\n7 (Tex.App.-Waco Apr. 21, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.). We are to construe arbitration clauses broadly, and when a contract\ncontains an arbitration clause, there is a presumption of arbitrability. See AT & T Tech., Inc. v. Communications Workers of\nAm., 475 U.S. 643, 650, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 1419, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986). Any doubts as to arbitrability are to be resolved in favor\nof coverage. FirstMerit Bank, 52 S.W.3d at 754. Likewise, we resolve any doubts about the scope of the arbitration agreement\nin favor of coverage. Id. In fact, the policy in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements is so compelling that a court should not\ndeny arbitration unless it can be said with positive assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation\ncovering the dispute at issue. Prudential Sec., Inc. v. Marshall, 909 S.W.2d 896, 899 (Tex.1995).\n\n [13]    [14] Generally, if the facts alleged “touch matters” that are covered by, have a “significant relationship” to, are\n“inextricably enmeshed” with, or are “factually intertwined” with the contract that contains the arbitration agreement, the\nclaims are arbitrable. Pennzoil Co. v. Arnold Oil Co., 30 S.W.3d 494, 498 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2000, orig. proceeding).\nIn other words, to come within the scope of the arbitration provision, a party's allegations need only be factually intertwined\nwith arbitrable claims or otherwise touch upon the subject matter of the agreement containing the arbitration provision. See\nPrudential, 909 S.W.2d at 900; Jack B. Anglin Co. v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d 266, 271 (Tex.1992).\n\n\nThe Arbitration Clause\nThe arbitration clause at issue in each of the employment agreements states:\n\n            Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy between the Company and Executive, arising out of or relating to\n            this Agreement, the breach of this Agreement, or otherwise, shall be settled by arbitration in Wilmington,\n            Delaware administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial\n            Rules then in effect and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court\n            having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a\n            court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, the issuance of an\n            injunction. However, either party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to\n            any court having jurisdiction over such dispute or controversy and seek interim provisional, injunctive\n            or other equitable relief until *470 the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise\n            resolved. Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or an award\n            rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim relief, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence,\n            content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the company and\n            Executive. Each party shall bear its or his own costs and expenses in any arbitration hereunder and one-\n            half of the arbitrator's fees and costs; provided, however, that the arbitrator shall have the discretion to\n            award the prevailing party reimbursement of its or his reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Cavanna, 374 S.W.3d 464 (2011)\n\n\nNo party is contending that the arbitration agreement is not valid or that arbitration should not be ordered. Rather, it is which\nclaims to be determined by the arbitrator that are at issue, specifically, the motion to reform. Therefore, the burden is on Cavanna,\nGray, and Nester to establish that the motion to reform the non-compete agreements is not within the scope of the arbitration\nagreement. See J.M. Davidson, 128 S.W.3d at 227.\n\nGWSI complains that the reformation of the non-compete agreements by the trial court was not allowed within the limited\ncategories of relief allowed by the arbitration clause, but that the issue of reformation should be determined by the arbitrator\nbecause reformation pursuant to Business and Commerce Code section 15.51(c) is an issue to be determined at a final hearing\non the merits. Because of this, GWSI contends that pursuant to the arbitration clause, the trial court could not permanently\nand finally reform the agreements prior to a determination on the merits at a final hearing, which should have been before\nthe arbitrator.\n\n [15] Cavanna, Gray, and Nester responded by contending both in the trial court and to this Court that the trial court's\nreformation of the employment agreements was allowed pursuant to the arbitration clause because it constitutes “other equitable\nrelief” as allowed in the arbitration clause. Their position is that the term “interim” does not apply to the entire phrase\n“interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief.” We disagree. The arbitration clause clearly contemplates that only\ntemporary relief may be sought in the trial court. In order for Cavanna, Gray, and Nester's interpretation to be correct, the\nphrase immediately following “interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief” which states “until the arbitration award\nis rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved” would have to be ignored entirely. Any equitable relief to be granted\nby the trial court would have to be interim in nature only, and thus that relief would seemingly be subsumed in or otherwise\nresolved at the final hearing on the merits. The trial court's reformation of the non-compete agreements can only be construed\nas a permanent reformation, which was not within the exception to the arbitration clause in the employment agreements.\n\n [16] Additionally, we agree that reformation pursuant to section 15.51(c) of the Business and Commerce Code is a remedy to\nbe granted at a final hearing, whether on the merits or by summary judgment, not as interim relief. See EMS USA, Inc. v. Shary,\n309 S.W.3d 653, 657 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.); Cardinal Health Staffing Network, Inc. v. Bowen, 106\nS.W.3d 230, 238–39 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no pet.). See also, e.g., Lockhart v.

(mem. op.).\n\n\nOther Provisions in the Agreement\n [17] Having determined that the trial court's reformation of the non-compete agreements did not fit within the exceptions to\nthe arbitration agreement, we must determine whether the reformation is an issue to be determined by the arbitrator or the trial\ncourt. Cavanna, Gray, and Nester contend that there are two provisions outside of the arbitration provisions in the employment\nagreements which establish that the trial court was the proper forum for the issue of the reformation of the non-compete\nagreements rather than to be determined through arbitration. The first is the reference to “a court of competent jurisdiction”\nwithin the tolling provision. The second is contained in the next paragraph, paragraph (h) in the acknowledgment section which\nstates:\n\n             (h) the covenants contained in Paragraphs 8 through 12 are reasonable with respect to their duration,\n             geographic area and scope. If, at the time of enforcement of this Paragraph 11, a court holds that the\n             restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under the circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree\n             that the maximum period, scope or geographic area legally permissible under such circumstances will\n             be substituted for the period, scope or area stated herein.\n\n\nCavanna, Gray, and Nester argue that these provisions establish a clear intent between the parties that even if the exception\nstated in the arbitration agreement itself does not allow for the reformation of the agreement pursuant to the Business and\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               8\n\fGray Wireline Service, Inc. v. Cavanna, 374 S.W.3d 464 (2011)\n\n\nCommerce Code as “other equitable relief,” the reformation dispute should be resolved only by the trial court because of the\nuse of the term “court” rather than “arbitrator” or “arbitral forum” in these additional paragraphs.\n\nThe motion to reform asked the trial court to determine that the restrictions contained within the non-compete agreements were\nnot reasonable either in scope or duration or alternatively, for the trial court to determine that they had fully complied with\nthe non-compete agreements. When we consider the factual allegations contained within the motion to reform, we find that\nthese claims necessarily “touch matters” that are covered by, have a “significant relationship” to, are “inextricably enmeshed”\nwith, or are “factually intertwined” with the contract that contains the arbitration agreement. See Pennzoil Co. v. Arnold Oil\nCo., 30 S.W.3d 494, 498 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2000, orig. proceeding). Thus, we find that Cavanna, Gray, and Nester have\nnot established an affirmative or other defense to the arbitration clause sufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of\narbitration, and therefore the trial court erred in ruling on the motion to reform. We sustain issue one. Because of our holding\nsustaining the first issue, we do not reach the second issue relating to the arbitrators determining arbitrability.\n\n\nStay of Proceedings\n [18] In its third issue, GWSI complains that the trial court erred by denying its motion to stay the proceedings entirely pending\nthe outcome of the arbitration. The trial court granted the motion to stay relating to Steve Gray, Cavanna, David Gray, Nester,\nand CGN Leasing but denied the motion as it relates to the other defendants.\n\n *472 [19] Federal law requires courts to stay litigation of claims that are subject to arbitration until arbitration is completed.\n9 U.S.C.A. § 3 (West 2009); In re Merrill Lynch Trust Co. FSB, 235 S.W.3d 185, 195–96 (Tex.2007) (orig. proceeding). Even\nwhen a party has brought arbitrable claims against one party and claims not subject to arbitration against another party in the\nsame lawsuit, courts should stay all litigation if the collateral litigation addresses the same issues as arbitration which threatens\nto render the arbitration moot. See In re Merrill Lynch Trust Co. FSB, 235 S.W.3d at 195–96.\n\nNone of the non-signatories have filed briefs in this Court. However, our review of the claims indicates that the central issue\nto all is the purported violation of the non-compete agreements. Therefore, the litigation should be stayed pending the outcome\nof the arbitration and the trial court erred to order otherwise. We sustain issue three.\n\n\nTEMPORARY INJUNCTION\n [20] GWSI indicated in its notice of appeal that it was appealing the trial court's order granting a temporary injunction against it\nand in favor of Steve Gray and CGN Leasing. Steve Gray and CGN Leasing contend that any complaint regarding the temporary\ninjunction has been waived because no issue was raised complaining of the trial court's entry of the temporary injunction. GWSI,\nin its reply brief, acknowledged the failure to raise the issue but argues that the injunction order is void on its face; therefore,\nthe issue is not waived by the failure to complain about the injunction order in the original appellant's brief.\n\n [21] Rule 683 of the Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth part of the requirements for a temporary injunction. See TEX.R.\nCIV. P. 683. Rule 683 requires that “[e]very order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for\ntrial on the merits with respect to the ultimate relief sought.” TEX.R. CIV. P. 683. The order of temporary injunction does not\ninclude an order setting the cause for trial on the merits as required by Rule 683. Id.; see also EOG Res., Inc. v. Gutierrez, 75\nS.W.3d 50, 52 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2002, no pet.) (reason for requiring injunction order to include trial date is to prevent\ntemporary injunction from effectively becoming permanent without trial). The requirements of Rule 683 are mandatory and\nmust be strictly followed. Qwest Commc'ns. Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 337 (Tex.2000) (per curiam); InterFirst\nBank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr. Co., 715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.1986) (per curiam).\n\n [22] [23] When a temporary injunction order does not meet the mandatory requirements of Rule 683, it must be declared\nvoid and dissolved, regardless of whether the defect was raised or briefed on appeal. InterFirst, 715 S.W.2d at 641 (temporary\ninjunction that does not set cause for trial on merits is void and must be dissolved); Bay Fin. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Brown, 142\nS.W.3d 586, 591 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2004, no pet.) (although error not raised on appeal, temporary injunction void because\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Cavanna, 374 S.W.3d 464 (2011)\n\n\nit did not include order setting cause for trial on merits); EOG Res., 75 S.W.3d at 53 (same). A void order has no force or effect\nand confers no right; it is a nullity. See In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d 268, 273 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding).\n\nBecause the temporary injunction order does not set the cause for trial on the merits, it is void. We reverse the trial court's\ntemporary injunction order and order that it be dissolved. InterFirst, 715 S.W.2d at 641 (Tex.1986).\n\n\n *473 Conclusion\nWe find that the trial court erred by reforming the employment agreements and not determining that the issue of reformation\nshould be determined by the arbitrators. We further find that the trial court erred by denying the motion to stay the litigation\nas to the non-signatories to the employment agreements until the completion of the arbitration. We order that the temporary\ninjunction is void and order the trial court to dissolve it. We reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings. The\nstay of the trial court proceedings issued by this Court on March 11, 2011 is hereby lifted.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      David Gray and Steve Gray are both defendants in the trial court proceedings. On appeal, the issue relating to Steve Gray and\n       CGN Leasing, LLC involves only the temporary injunction. The other issues relating to the reformation, the arbitration, and the stay\n       of proceedings involves David Gray but not Steve Gray. Therefore, in this opinion we will refer to Steve Gray by his full name.\n       References to “Gray” refer to David Gray only.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                         © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In three issues,\nappellant, David Henke, contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant the motion to dissolve because:\n\n  (1) the portions of the underlying orders which comprise the temporary injunction are subject to being declared void and\n     dissolved because they fail to meet the mandatory requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 1 in that they: (a) do\n     not specify a trial date, (b) do not set forth the reason for the issuance of the temporary injunction, (c) are not specific as to\n     the terms of the temporary injunction, and (d) do not contain reasonable detail as to the act or acts sought to be restrained\n     without reference to the complaint or other document;\n\n\n  (2) while the parties agreed to a temporary injunction, the injunctive provisions as embodied in the orders constitute a\n     permanent injunction in the absence of an order setting the case for trial; and\n\n       (3) the basis for the temporary orders was to provide an orderly manner for the liquidation of collateral—because the\n          collateral has been liquidated and the proceeds applied to the debt owed Peoples State Bank, the reasons for the\n          issuance of the temporary injunction no longer exist.\n\n   We affirm the trial court's order.\nThe record reflects the trial court rendered: (1) a temporary restraining order, signed on August 8, 1997; (2) an agreed order,\nsigned on August 22, 1997, granting a temporary injunction; (3) an agreed order, signed on September 5, 1997, modifying the\ntemporary orders (the temporary restraining order of August 8 and the agreed temporary injunction of August 22); and (4) an\nagreed order, signed on *720 September 16, 1997, modifying the temporary restraining order (and all temporary injunction\norders) and providing for the terms and conditions for the sale of cattle.\n\nHenke could not appeal the temporary restraining order; however, he had twenty days within which to perfect an appeal from\nthe remaining temporary orders. TEX.R.APP. P. 42; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014 (Vernon 1997). Henke\ndid not appeal any of the temporary orders.\n\nOn April 22, 1999, Henke filed a motion to dissolve the temporary injunction and the subsequent modifying orders. The trial\ncourt denied the motion on April 27, 1999 stating, “Henke has not timely appealed or otherwise challenged the Orders and ...\nhe has agreed to the Orders.” Henke appeals from the trial court's order denying his motion to dissolve.\n\n\n\n                                               A.

MOTION TO DISSOLVE\n\n [4] [5] [6] The determination of whether to dissolve a temporary injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\nCellular Marketing, Inc. v. Houston Cellular Telephone Co., 784 S.W.2d 734, 735 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, no\nwrit). On appeal, our review is limited to the narrow question of whether the trial court abused its discretion by denying the\nmotion to dissolve. Walling v. Metcalfe, 863 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex.1993). Accordingly, Henke has the burden to establish that\nthe trial court abused its discretion. Tober v. Turner of Texas, 668 S.W.2d 831, 834 (Tex.App.—Austin 1984, no writ).\n\n\n\n                                                        C. RULE 683\n\n [7] Henke correctly argues that the orders to which he and Peoples State Bank agreed, and which the trial court signed, are\ntechnically subject to being declared void and dissolved because they fail to meet the requirements of Rule 683. However,\nbecause Henke failed to appeal the trial court's order granting the temporary injunction and the subsequent modifying orders,\nwe hold Henke has waived his right to complain of any errors in those orders.\n\n [8] [9] Further, the general rule is that a party may not appeal from or attack a judgment to which he has agreed, absent\nallegation and proof of fraud, collusion, or misrepresentation. First American Title Ins. Co. v. Adams, 829 S.W.2d 356, 364\n(Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1992, writ denied) (citing Bexar County Criminal Dist. Attorney's Office v. Mayo, 773 S.W.2d 642,\n644 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1989, no writ) and Charalambous v. Jean Lafitte Corp., 652 S.W.2d 521, 525 (Tex.App.—El\nPaso 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.)). We find no evidence in the record of fraud, collusion, or misrepresentation. Because he agreed to\nthe orders, we hold Henke has waived any error and has waived his right to appeal.\n\n\n\n                      *721 C. CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES AND FUNDAMENTAL ERROR\n\n [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] A trial court may modify a temporary injunction because of changed circumstances. Smith\nv. O'Neill, 813 S.W.2d 501, 502 (Tex.1991). The movant must prove that circumstances have changed. City of Seagoville v.\nSmith, 695 S.W.2d 288, 289 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1985, no writ). Changed circumstances are conditions that altered the status\nquo existing after the temporary injunction was granted or that made the temporary injunction unnecessary or improper. Desai\nv. Reliance Mach. Works, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ). The trial court has no\nduty, upon the filing of a motion to dissolve, to reconsider the grant of the injunction if the motion does not allege fundamental\nerror or changed conditions. Cellular Marketing, 784 S.W.2d at 735. The trial court cannot be held to have abused its discretion\nby refusing to alter its prior decision if there is no new evidence. Id. The purpose of a motion to dissolve is to provide a means\nto show that changed circumstances or changes in the law require the modification or dissolution of the injunction; the purpose\nis not to give an unsuccessful party an opportunity to relitigate the propriety of the original grant. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 836.\nThe Tober Court stated:\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                          5\n\fHenke v. Peoples State Bank of Hallettsville, 6 S.W.3d 717 (1999)\n\n\n\n\n              From a practical standpoint, if a litigant could, by motion to dissolve, force reconsideration of the original\n              grant, without a showing of changed conditions, then there is an incentive for him to do so at least once,\n              or more often, in hope that he will be able to wear down the resistance of the original trial judge, or in\n              hope that he will be able to secure a hearing before a different trial judge who may be more sympathetic.\n              Such actions needlessly add to the judicial caseload, both at the trial and appellate level. Recognition of\n              the principle that the trial court has no duty to reconsider the validity of the original grant of temporary\n              injunction upon motion to dissolve enables the trial court to dispose of motions to dissolve solely upon\n              the pleadings when the motion to dissolve, on its face, shows that the litigant offers no new evidence.\n\nId. at 835.\n\n[15]    At the hearing on the motion to dissolve, Henke argued the orders he had agreed to were “void.” He stated:\n\n              Under the case law and under the Rules of Civil Procedure a temporary injunction must set forth a date\n              for trial in order for it to be valid.... And also, if it does not contain a trial setting and if it does not contain\n              findings as to the reason for it, it is void and may not be made valid by waiver.\n\n\n [16] [17] Initially, it appears the trial court's failure to comply with Rule 683 is fundamental error. The requirements of rule\n683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed. InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr. Co., 715 S.W.2d 640, 641\n(Tex.1986). If the error is fundamental, the trial court had a duty to reconsider the grant of the temporary injunction and the\nmodifying orders. See Cellular Marketing, 784 S.W.2d at 735. However, because the orders were agreed, they are not subject\nto attack by Henke. See Alexander v. Alexander, 373 S.W.2d 800, 805 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1963, no writ). Because\nHenke actively agreed to each order, we hold the deficiencies in the orders are not fundamental error.\n\n [18] Henke contends the temporary injunction should have been dissolved because of changed conditions. Henke argues the\nagreed order of September 16, 1997, provided for the liquidation of collateral (sale of cattle) and the application of the proceeds\nto the indebtedness of his creditors. Henke contends the collateral has been liquidated and the proceeds have been applied to\nthe debt he owed Peoples State Bank. Thus, he argues, the reason for the temporary injunction no longer exists.\n\n *722 After reviewing the record, we hold Henke did not prove a change in the circumstances made the basis of the temporary\ninjunction. We note that Henke's motion to dissolve alleges only the violation of Rule 683 and not any changed conditions. The\nrecord reflects that Henke only argued changed conditions at the hearing on the motion to dissolve. Henke argued:\n\n              [T]he whole point of the order is now moot. Peoples Bank was paid in December of 1997. They continue\n              to pursue Mr. Henke and raise their attorneys' fees up to a quarter of a million dollars level when they\n              were paid within three months of filing this lawsuit. The purpose for the injunction doesn't exist anymore.\n              All the money that is going to be collected has been collected months and months ago.\n\n\nHenke's argument is no evidence that circumstances had changed. The agreed order modifying temporary orders, signed\non September 5, 1997, states that Henke was indebted to Peoples State Bank, First State Bank, Prairie Livestock, Friona\nAgricultural Credit Corporation, and several other entities. Henke made no effort to prove that all these entities had been paid\nin full.\n\nIn addition, the order states:\n\n              In the event disbursements to PSB [Peoples State Bank] for application to the Henke's debt result in\n              payment in full of Henke's debt to PSB, then, all additional proceeds that are distributed to PSB under the\n              provisions of this order are to be maintained by PSB in an interest-bearing escrow account and disbursed\n              only upon further order of this Court.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Peoples State Bank of Hallettsville, 6 S.W.3d 717 (1999)\n\n\n\n\nThus, even if Peoples State Bank was paid in full as alleged by Henke, the temporary injunction and the modifying orders are\nstill necessary to ensure the proper disbursement of any remaining proceeds.\n\nWe hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Henke's motion to dissolve. We overrule Henke's three issues.\n\nThe trial court's order denying Henke's motion to dissolve is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      RULE 683.

(Vernon Supp.1982),\nalleging they had been damaged by their purchase of a defective mechanical bucking bull. Trial was to a jury which answered\nthe Plaintiffs' issues generally in favor of the Plaintiffs. However, the jury also answered issues which submitted the Defendant's\ntheory that the dispute had been previously compromised and settled in favor of the Defendant. Based on the latter findings, a\ntake nothing judgment was entered against the Plaintiffs who now bring this appeal. We affirm.\n\nOn February 18, 1981, the parties entered into a written agreement by which the Defendant agreed to sell to the Plaintiffs the\nbucking mechanical bull for the total price of $5,250.00, the terms being the sum of $1,000.00 cash paid to the Defendant on\nthe date of the contract, $1,500.00 to be paid on the date of delivery and the balance by a series of IOUs. The bull was delivered\nto the Plaintiffs in El Paso about the first of March and the $1,500.00 was paid to the Defendant. Plaintiffs then took the device\nto their place of entertainment in Juarez, Mexico, and it immediately started breaking down. This occurred on three or four\noccasions. According to the Defendant, one of the Plaintiffs then came to the Defendant in El Paso some time in March, and a\nnew agreement was entered into whereby the parties agreed to rescind the sale. The sum of $1,000.00 in cash was immediately\nrepaid to the Plaintiffs as well as $500.00 of the IOUs. Defendant agreed that when the Plaintiffs delivered the bull back to\nhim in El Paso he would give the Plaintiffs the balance of their cash and notes that they had paid on the contract. The Plaintiffs\nthereafter never returned the bucking bull, although the defendant was ready, able and willing to return the balance of the\npurchase price upon the return of the bull.\n\nOn June 26, a letter termed a Deceptive Trade Practices Act Notice was mailed to the Defendant by the Plaintiffs' attorney. By\nit, demands were made for the balance of the purchase price, the cost of certain repairs made to the machine, losses of business\nsuffered by the Plaintiffs and attorney's fees. Thereafter the suit was filed and the trial resulted. At the trial, the jury returned\nissues in favor of the Plaintiffs regarding two Deceptive Trade Practices Acts and breaches of express and implied warranties.\nIn addition, they found that the Plaintiffs had suffered $4,400.00 in actual damages and $4,700.00 in lost profits. No attack by\nthe Defendant is made on this appeal as to these findings.\n\nThe findings that are the subject of this appeal are those regarding Special Issue Nos. 27, 28 and 29. The jury determined by\nNo. 27 that the Plaintiffs and Defendant *93 entered into an agreement for the return of the mechanical bull to El Paso and\nthe refund of the purchase monies, by No. 28 that the Plaintiffs after that agreement refused to return the said mechanical bull,\nand by No. 29 that the Defendant stood ready, able and willing to refund said monies upon return of the mechanical bull. On\nthe basis of these answers, the court entered the take nothing judgment.\n\nThe Plaintiffs' first point of error alleges that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law based upon the favorable jury\nfindings on their cause of action and award of damages. Under the point, they further argue that as a matter of law Special Issue\nNos. 27, 28 and 29 were either improperly submitted or were immaterial to the verdict as a matter of law. The Plaintiffs' position\nis that the statutory cause of action created by the Deceptive Trade Practices Act can only be defended against by the statutory\ndefenses specifically enumerated in the Act. Section 17.50B(d) provides a defense to any cause of action under Section 17.50 if\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Telles, 663 S.W.2d 91 (1983)\n\n\nthe Defendant proves: (1) that he received statutory notice of the claim, (2) that within thirty days of the date of said notice he,\n(3) tendered to the consumer the amount of actual damages claimed and expenses reasonably incurred in asserting the claim.\nThe Plaintiffs argue that there is no evidence to prove that the defendant ever complied with the Act.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Regardless of the statute, the issues in question submitted the Defendant's theory that there\nwas a compromise and settlement of the cause of action between the parties in March, 1981. A disputed or unliquidated claim\nis the basis for a compromise. The law has always favored the resolution of controversies through compromise and settlement\nrather than through litigation and it has always been the policy of the law to uphold and enforce such contracts if they are\nfairly made and are not in contravention of some law or public policy. 15A Am.Jur.2d, Compromise and Settlement, secs. 2\nand 5 (1976). We hold that even the strong policy of the statute to protect consumers against false, misleading and deceptive\nbusiness practices, which is the foundation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act does not overrule the stronger policy of the\nlaw favoring settlements of disputes. A compromise and settlement agreement is subject to the general principles of the law\nof contracts. An enforceable agreement of compromise requires an offer of compromise, a meeting of minds of the parties and\nan unconditional acceptance within the time and on the terms offered. It is essential that the amount of the claim be disputed.\n12 Tex.Jur.3d, Compromise and Settlement, sec. 4 (1981). All of the recited elements were met according to the testimony\nof the Defendant, and the special issues in question together with any necessary implied findings by the court resolved the\ndispute in the Defendant's favor. The original contract of sale was replaced by the new agreement made by the compromise\nand settlement. It was the Plaintiffs who breached the new agreement and they should not be in a position to profit by their\nbreach. The first point is overruled.\n\n [8] [9] [10] The Plaintiffs' second point of error is that the trial court erred in overruling their objections to the submission of\nSpecial Issue Nos. 27, 28 and 29, as they were not controlling issues on any theory of defense and had no effect upon the liability\nissues in the case. As previously discussed, we disagree with this contention. Also under this point, the Plaintiffs argue that\nthere was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support the submission. We have considered only the evidence and inferences\ntherefrom which support the jury's findings and the no evidence argument is overruled. Having considered all of the evidence,\nthe factual insufficiency argument is likewise overruled.\n\nAlso under the point, the Plaintiffs complain because the pleadings supporting these defensive issues were not filed within\nseven days of trial without leave of court. It appears this pleading was filed as a trial amendment and no objection appears in\nthe record to the filing of this pleading or to the evidence supporting it. The objection now made on appeal as to the late filing\nof the answer is untimely and the objection has been waived. The second point of error is overruled.\n\n*94 The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Christian Corcoran and Peggy Corcoran, relators, seek a writ of mandamus ordering respondent,\nthe Honorable Shearn Smith, sitting for the Honorable Kyle Carter in the 125th District Court of Harris County, Texas, to\nvacate his order signed August 3, 2009, granting an Agreed Mutual Temporary Injunction.

Civ. P. 683. “This provision is mandatory; a failure to include a trial setting is\ngrounds for voiding the injunction.” Kaufmann v.

The writ will issue only if the Honorable Shearn Smith fails to act in accordance\nwith this opinion.\n\nRelators also contend the Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Contempt, signed October 14, 2009, must be vacated. We agree.\nA trial court that holds a party in contempt for violating a void order necessarily abuses its discretion. See In re Garza, 126\nS.W.3d at 272 (citing Ex parte Shaffer, 649 S.W.2d 300, 301–02 (Tex.1983)). Here, the trial court held relators in contempt for\nviolating a void order.

Rayes, to vacate the May 28,\n2003 contempt judgment. Because we conclude that Garza is entitled to the relief sought, we conditionally grant the writ.\n\n\n\n                                                       BACKGROUND\n\nThis mandamus proceeding arises out of a dispute over a family business. In October 1995, Real Party in Interest Jaime Trevino\nand his cousin, Alfred G. Garza, entered into a partnership agreement to operate a business called Lobo Security. According to\nTrevino, however, his uncle, Alfred S. Garza, was his true partner. For personal financial reasons, Alfred S. Garza had requested\nthat the partnership agreement name his son, Alfred G. Garza, as Trevino's partner. During their partnership, Trevino claims\nthat Alfred S. Garza diverted partnership funds for his own benefit and the benefit of his immediate family members. On March\n1, 2001, Alfred S. Garza died.\n\nOn July 27, 2001, Trevino sued Alfred S. Garza's estate for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. Trevino also\nsued his aunt, Relator Andrea Garza, Alfred G. Garza, his partner under the partnership agreement, and two of his other cousins\nfor fraud, conversion, civil conspiracy, and aiding and abetting Alfred S. Garza's breach of fiduciary duty. Additionally, Trevino\nsought a declaratory judgment regarding the characterization of the partnership's property. In response, Alfred G. Garza filed a\ncounterclaim for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and conversion.\nAlfred G. Garza also sought declaratory relief.\n\nOn August 8, 2001, the trial court entered a temporary injunction, preventing the defendants (“the Garzas”) from depleting their\nassets during litigation. The Garzas were enjoined from “[d]estroying, removing, concealing, encumbering, transferring, or\notherwise harming or reducing the value of the property of one or both of the parties.” And, they were enjoined from “[s]elling,\ntransferring, assigning, mortgaging, encumbering, or in any other manner alienating any of the property of [Trevino] or [the\nGarzas], whether personalty or realty, and whether separate or community, except as specifically authorized” by the trial court.\nThe temporary injunction did permit the Garzas to incur indebtedness to pay legal expenses. It did *270 not, however, contain\na trial setting date or provide for a bond.\n\nA year later, the Garzas moved to dissolve the temporary injunction. Trevino then filed his first motion for contempt, which\nwas denied by the trial court. On April 17, 2003, Trevino filed his second motion for contempt, arguing that Andrea Garza had\nviolated the temporary injunction by borrowing $112,000 against her homestead to pay for her legal fees and costs. According\nto Trevino, the temporary injunction's prohibition against encumbrances trumped the provision allowing Garza to fund her\ndefense. After holding an evidentiary hearing, the trial court signed a “Judgment of Contempt” on May 28, 2003, ordering\nGarza, on or before July 1, 2003, to effectuate a release of lien and pay Trevino's attorney $3,500 and costs of the proceeding.\nOn June 26, 2003, Garza filed this mandamus proceeding, seeking relief from the trial court's contempt judgment. 2\n\n\n\n                                                         MANDAMUS\n\n [1] [2] Mandamus issues only to correct a clear abuse of discretion or a violation of a duty imposed by law when there is no\nother adequate remedy at law.

Thus, she argues that\nthe trial court abused its discretion in holding her in contempt for violating a void order. See Ex parte Shaffer, 649 S.W.2d\n300, 301–02 (Tex.1983) (holding that trial court abuses its discretion by holding party in contempt for violating void order). In\nresponse, Trevino argues that Garza has waived her complaint by agreeing to the terms of the temporary injunction.\n\nThe temporary injunction states that “[t]he parties have agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below.”\nAlthough counsel for the Garzas signed the temporary injunction, his signature was prefaced by the phrase, “Approved as to\nForm Only.” However, in “Defendants' Motion to Dissolve or Modify Temporary Restraining Order,” counsel for the Garzas\nadmits that at the time the temporary injunction was entered, the Garzas had agreed to its terms. The record, therefore, shows\nthat the Garzas did, in fact, agree to the terms of the temporary injunction.\n\n [3] According to Trevino, because the Garzas agreed to the terms of the temporary injunction, they are barred from complaining\nof any error now. Trevino emphasizes that generally, a party may not appeal from or attack a judgment to which he has agreed,\nabsent allegation and proof of fraud, collusion, or misrepresentation. Henke v. Peoples State Bank, 6 S.W.3d 717, 720 (Tex.App.-\nCorpus Christi 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.). “The rationale for this rule is that a party should not be allowed, but rather be estopped,\nto complain on *271 appeal of an action or ruling which he invited, agreed to, or induced.” Ayala v. Minniti, 714 S.W.2d\n452, 456 (Tex.App.-Houston 1986, no writ). By consenting to the action of the court, a party waives all errors committed or\ncontained in the judgment, except want of jurisdiction. Id.\n\nSpecifically, Trevino relies on Henke v. Peoples State Bank, 6 S.W.3d 717 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.),\na case with similar facts to those presented here. In Henke, the appellant filed an interlocutory appeal of the trial court's denial\nof his motion to dissolve a temporary injunction, arguing that the temporary injunction was void because it did not set a trial\ndate. Id. at 719. As here, the appellant had agreed to the temporary injunction at the time it was entered. Relying on the general\nrule that a party may not appeal or attack an agreed judgment, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals held that by agreeing to the\ntemporary injunction, the appellant had waived any error and had waived his right to appeal. Id. at 720.\n\n [4] [5] The Thirteenth Court of Appeals, however, failed to discuss if a party could agree to a void order. Garza argues that\nshe has not waived her rights, because the temporary injunction is void. We agree that if the temporary injunction is void, Garza\nhas not waived her rights to attack the void injunction. A void order has no force or effect and confers no rights; it is a mere\nnullity. Slaughter v. Qualls, 139 Tex. 340, 345, 162 S.W.2d 671, 674 (1942). Thus, a party who agrees to a void order has\nagreed to nothing. And, a trial court that holds a party in contempt for violating a void order necessarily abuses its discretion.\nEx parte Shaffer, 649 S.W.2d at 301–02. In response, Trevino contends that the temporary injunction is voidable, not void. We\nmust, therefore, determine whether the temporary injunction is void or voidable.\n\n\n\n                                                    VOID OR VOIDABLE?\n\n [6] [7] Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 provides that “[e]very order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order\nsetting the cause for trial on the merits with respect to the ultimate relief sought.” TEX.R. CIV. P. 683. The Texas Supreme\nCourt has stated that the requirements of rule 683 are mandatory, and “an order granting a temporary injunction that does\nnot meet them is subject to being declared void and dissolved.” Qwest Comm. Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 337\n(Tex.2000) (per curiam); see also InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr.

Thus, we have held that failure to meet the requirements of rule 683 renders the injunction order “fatally defective\nand void, whether specifically raised by point of error or not.” 3 EOG Res., Inc. v. Gutierrez, 75 S.W.3d 50, 53 (Tex.App.-San\nAntonio 2002, no pet.) (quoting Hopper v. Safeguard Bus. Sys., Inc., 787 S.W.2d 624, 626 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1990, no\nwrit)); accord Kaufmann v. Morales, 93 S.W.3d 650, 656–57 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.); *272 Permian\nChem. Co. v. State, 746 S.W.2d 873, 874 (Tex.App.-El Paso 1988, writ dism'd); TY Equity Group, Inc. v.

(not designated for publication).\n\nDespite all the above-cited case law, Trevino argues that the temporary injunction is voidable because a judgment that is\ncontrary to statute, constitutional provision, or procedural rule is merely voidable. Unlike a void judgment that is subject to\ncollateral attack, a voidable judgment has effect until challenged. Thus, a voidable judgment may become valid by failure to\ntimely challenge it by direct appeal. Because Garza did not challenge the temporary injunction by interlocutory appeal, Trevino\ncontends that the temporary injunction has now become valid.\n\nIn support of his argument that the temporary injunction is merely voidable, Trevino cites Reiss v. Reiss, 118 S.W.3d 439\n(Tex., 2003). In Reiss, the supreme court interpreted a 1980 divorce decree that divided retirement benefits stemming from one\nspouse's employment both during and after the marriage. Id. at 440. The trial court held that the language in the divorce decree\nincluded retirement benefits accrued after the marriage. Id. The former husband appealed, arguing that the divorce decree is a\nvoid judgment because the trial court that entered it did not have jurisdiction to divest him of his separate property, i.e. retirement\nbenefits accrued after the divorce. Id. at 442. Thus, the former husband contended that as a void judgment, the divorce decree\nwas subject to attack at any time. Id. The supreme court disagreed. Id.\n\nThe supreme court noted that in general, “as long as the court entering a judgment has jurisdiction of the parties and the\nsubject matter and does not act outside its capacity as a court, the judgment is not void.” Id. Thus, according to the supreme\ncourt, other than lack of jurisdiction, errors “such as a court's action contrary to a statute or statutory equivalent, merely render\nthe judgment voidable so that it may be corrected through the ordinary appellate process or other proper proceedings.” Id.\n(internal quotations omitted). Thus, Trevino argues that because Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 was violated in this case,\nthe temporary injunction is voidable, not void, according to Reiss.\n\nFor support, Reiss cites Dubai Petroleum Co. v. Kazi, 12 S.W.3d 71 (Tex.2000) and Mapco, Inc. v. Forrest, 795 S.W.2d 700,\n703 (Tex.1990) (per curiam). Dubai and Mapco, however, were decided before Qwest Communications Corp. v. AT & T Corp.,\n24 S.W.3d 334 (Tex.2000) (per curiam). In Qwest, the supreme court reiterated the following:\n\n             The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require that an order granting a temporary injunction set the cause\n             for trial on the merits and fix the amount of security to be given by the applicant. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 683,\n             684. These procedural requirements are mandatory, and an order granting a temporary injunction that\n             does not meet them is subject to being declared void and dissolved. See InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A.\n             v. Paz Constr. Co., 715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.1986) (stating that requirements of rule 683 are mandatory\n             and must be strictly followed). In InterFirst Bank, however, the order failed to set the case for trial on\n             the merits. Id. at 641. Yet rather than dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction, we declared the\n             temporary injunction void and ordered it dissolved. See id. We have also held that a temporary injunction\n             was void when there was no bond. See *273 Lancaster v. Lancaster, 155 Tex. 528, 291 S.W.2d 303, 308\n             (1956) (holding that bond provisions of rule 684 are mandatory). Here, these procedural requirements\n             may render the trial court's order void but they do not change the order's character and function defining\n             its classification.\n\nQwest, 24 S.W.3d at 337 (emphasis added). Qwest, thus, clearly states that unless a temporary injunction complies with both\nrules 683 and 684, it is void. Qwest was decided after Dubai, the case relied on by the supreme court in Reiss. Thus, we must\nassume that if the supreme court believed the principles it stated in Dubai applied to temporary injunctions, it would have so\nstated in Qwest. Moreover, Reiss does not discuss temporary injunctions in any manner. We, therefore, must follow Qwest's\nholding.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

According to Trevino, “subject to being declared void” means that the order is voidable, not void. However,\nthe Qwest court made clear that a temporary injunction failing to comply with rules 683 and 684 is void. See Qwest, 24 S.W.3d\nat 337 (“[W]e declared the temporary injunction void and ordered it dissolved. We have also held that a temporary injunction\nwas void when there was no bond.”). If the supreme court had meant that such a temporary injunction was voidable, we feel\ncertain it would have used the word “voidable.” Instead, the court has repeatedly used the word “void.” See Qwest, 24 S.W.3d\nat 337; InterFirst Bank, 715 S.W.2d at 641. We, therefore, hold that because the temporary injunction here failed to comply\nwith rules 683 and 684, it is void. 4\n\n\n\n                                                      CONTEMPT JUDGMENT\n\n [9] A trial court that holds a party in contempt for violating a void order necessarily abuses its discretion. Ex parte Shaffer,\n649 S.W.2d 300, 301–02 (Tex.1983). Here, the trial court held Garza in contempt for violating a void order. As such, the trial\ncourt abused its discretion, and Garza is entitled to the relief sought.\n\n\n\n                                                             CONCLUSION\n\nBecause the trial court abused its discretion, we conditionally grant Garza's petition for writ of mandamus. TEX.R.APP. P.\n52.8(c). Only if the Honorable Donna S. Rayes fails to vacate the “Judgment of Contempt” signed on May 28, 2003, will we\nissue the writ.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      This proceeding arises out of Cause No. 01–07–0443–CVA, styled Jaime J. Trevino v. Andrea Garza, Annette Carrasco, Amanda\n       Garcia, and Alfred G. Garza, pending in the 81st Judicial District Court, Atascosa County, Texas, the Honorable Donna S. Rayes\n       presiding.\n2      Garza also filed a motion to stay the contempt judgment. We granted the motion and stayed the contempt judgment pending final\n       disposition of this petition.\n3      The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo of the subject matter of the suit, pending a final trial on the merits\n       of the case. Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex.2002). There are at least two reasons for requiring a temporary\n       injunction to include a trial date. One is to prevent the temporary injunction from effectively becoming permanent without a trial.\n       EOG Res., 75 S.W.3d at 53; see also Kaufmann, 93 S.W.3d at 657. The second is for the order to be complete on its face and not\n       “reference to the complaint or other document.” Kaufmann, 93 S.W.3d at 657 (quoting rule 683). “It is important for trial judges or\n       parties to read the original order and have before them all information relevant to the injunction.” Id.\n4      Because we have determined that the temporary injunction is void, we need not reach the relator's other issues.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\n\n\nMemorandum Opinion by Justice GARZA.\n\n*1 Appellant/relator, Graybar Electric Company (“Graybar”), alleges that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its\nmotion to partially dissolve or modify an injunction granted in favor of appellees/real parties in interest, Alvaro Gonzalez and\nLaredo Hix, L.P. (“Laredo Hix”). By two issues in its first interlocutory appeal, cause number 13-08-00294-CV, 1 Graybar\ncontends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its motion because: (1) the trial court did not have jurisdiction under\nthe Texas Property Code, see TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 53.157(2) (Vernon 2007); and (2) the trial court did not have subject\nmatter jurisdiction to issue a temporary injunction pursuant to section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code. See TEX.\nCIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 65.023 (Vernon 1997). 2 In addition, Graybar petitions this Court for a writ of mandamus,\nin cause number 13-08-00073-CV, directing the Hidalgo County district court to set aside its order denying Graybar's motion\nto abate, by which the court effectively asserts dominant jurisdiction.\n\nBy six issues, reorganized as four, Graybar alleges in its second interlocutory appeal, cause number 13-08-00341-CV, that the\ntrial court abused its discretion in granting Laredo Hix's motion to extend the original temporary injunction. 3 Graybar, MIRA\nEnterprises, Inc. (“MIRA”), and Mark Stallings Electric, Inc. (“Stallings”) also petition this Court for a writ of mandamus,\nin cause number 13-08-00333-CV, directing the Hidalgo County district court to transfer the entire case to Webb County.\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment in cause number 13-08-00294-CV; we deny Graybar's petition for writ of mandamus in\ncause number 13-08-00073-CV; we dismiss Graybar's appeal in cause number 13-08-00341-CV; and we deny Graybar's second\npetition for writ of mandamus in cause number 13-08-00333-CV.\n\n\n\n                                    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis case centers on the management and construction of a Holiday Inn Express & Suites Hotel in Laredo, Texas. On January\n18, 2007, HMC Hospitality Operating Company (“HMC”) filed suit against Gonzalez in Collin County, asserting claims for\nbreach of contract, declaratory judgment, quantum meruit, and attorney's fees with respect to alleged breaches of various hotel\nmanagement agreements between HMC and Gonzalez pertaining to the Laredo Holiday Inn. The district court in Collin County\ntransferred the case to Hidalgo County on April 4, 2007, in response to a motion to transfer venue filed by Gonzalez.\n\n\nOn May 23, 2007, Graybar 4 perfected a mechanic's lien against the Laredo Holiday Inn and its owner, Laredo Hix, by filing its\nlien in the public records of Webb County. Graybar sought repayment for materials provided in the construction of the Laredo\nHoliday Inn in the amount of $37,788.55.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, Gonzalez filed an amended answer and counterclaim in the Hidalgo County district court denying the\nallegations made by HMC, asserting various affirmative defenses, and stating a counterclaim for fraud. Subsequently, Gonzalez\nfiled an application for a temporary restraining order and motions for temporary and permanent injunctive relief in the Hidalgo\nCounty district court, seeking to enjoin HMC from communicating with or litigating against Gonzalez.\n\n *2 On July 20, 2007, The Gonzalez-DLS Family Limited Partnership and Brownsville SB, L.P. filed an original petition in\nintervention in the Hidalgo County suit against HMC seeking declaratory relief, damages for breach of contract and fraud,\nexemplary damages, and attorney's fees pertaining to alleged material misrepresentations made by HMC to induce Gonzalez\nto enter into various hotel management agreements for four separate hotels in Pharr, McAllen, Brownsville, and Laredo. In\naddition, Ascension Hospitality Management, L.L.C. filed a petition in intervention to join in Hidalgo County suit. Furthermore,\nall parties joined in Gonzalez's application for temporary injunction.\n\nOn August 6, 2007, the Hidalgo County district court granted Gonzalez's application for temporary injunction. In its order, the\ncourt restrained HMC “from continuing to harass, threaten or communicate with the Gonzalez Group and the Gonzalez Group's\nemployees, agents, or representatives....” The court also restrained HMC “from filing, initiating, serving any process and from\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                2\n\fIn re Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\ncontinuing any litigation against the Gonzalez Group and the Gonzalez Group's employees, agents[,] and representatives....” On\nAugust 23, 2007, HMC filed notice of its accelerated interlocutory appeal which was assigned cause number 13-07-00518-CV. 5\n\nOn September 24, 2007, Graybar filed an original petition in Webb County against Stallings, MIRA, and Laredo Hix seeking to\nforeclose on the lien it filed on May 23, 2007, asserting that the defendants had failed to timely pay balances due for materials\nfurnished for the construction of the Laredo Holiday Inn. 6 In its petition, Graybar contended that it was owed $37,788.55 for\nmaterials provided.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, Laredo Hix filed an original petition in intervention with the Hidalgo County district court. In its petition,\nLaredo Hix named sixteen parties as counter-defendants. Among the many counter-defendants were HMC, MIRA, Graybar,\nand Stallings. Laredo Hix claimed that HMC was in breach of contract, was negligent, and had breached a fiduciary duty owed\nto it. Additionally, Laredo Hix contended that Graybar, MIRA, and Stallings were in breach of contract and had negligently\ncarried out their duties in the construction of the Laredo Holiday Inn. Laredo Hix also filed an application for a temporary\nrestraining order and requests for temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent Graybar from pursuing its suit in Webb\nCounty until the Hidalgo County suit was resolved. Also on October 9, 2007, Gonzalez filed a supplemental counterclaim, an\napplication for temporary restraining order, and requests for temporary and permanent injunctions against Graybar which were\nvirtually identical to those filed by Laredo Hix. 7\n\nOn November 2, 2007, the Hidalgo County district court granted the requests for temporary injunction made by Gonzalez and\nLaredo Hix. The court specifically restrained Graybar from (1) “continuing to harass, threaten or communicate with Laredo\nHix, L.P. and/or Alvaro Gonzalez, and their employees, agents, or representatives,” and (2) “filing, initiating, serving any\nprocess, and from continuing any litigation either criminal or civil against Laredo Hix, L.P., and/or Alvaro Gonzalez, and\ntheir employees, agents and representatives, except in this Court.” The temporary injunction, which was in part an anti-suit\ninjunction, was to last until May 12, 2008, when the matter was set for trial.\n\n *3 On November 8, 2007, Graybar filed a motion to partially dissolve or modify the November 2, 2007 injunction and a\nverified plea in abatement with the Hidalgo County district court. In support of its motion, Graybar attached a copy of its original\npetition in Webb County against Stallings, MIRA, and Laredo Hix. 8 On January 2, 2008, after a hearing, the Hidalgo County\ndistrict court denied Graybar's motion and plea in abatement. Graybar perfected its appeal. 9 Graybar also filed a petition for\nwrit of mandamus on February 4, 2008, claiming that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its plea in abatement\nbecause the Webb County district court has dominant jurisdiction over all claims.\n\nAt a hearing on May 12, 2008, the Hidalgo County district court denied motions to transfer venue filed by Graybar and other\ninterested parties-namely, Harden Plumbing Company, Inc., Pete Gallegos Paving, Inc., Stallings, and MIRA-and addressed a\nmotion to compel. However, the court did not commence a trial on the merits at this time. Nevertheless, the November 2, 2007\ntemporary injunction expired. On May 20, 2008, Gonzalez and Laredo Hix filed an emergency motion to extend the November\n2, 2007 temporary injunction until November 10, 2008, when the matter was scheduled for a trial on the merits in Hidalgo\nCounty. The Hidalgo County district court granted the extension, noting that “[a]ll findings set forth in this Court's Temporary\nInjunction Order dated November 2, 2007 are incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein.” No other changes were\nmade to the temporary injunction.\n\nGraybar, MIRA, and Stallings filed a joint petition for writ of mandamus in cause number 13-08-00333-CV on May 27, 2008,\nasserting that the venue provisions of the civil practice and remedies code mandate venue in Webb County. See id. §§ 15.011,\n15.012 (Vernon 2002). In conjunction with its motion for leave of court, which we granted earlier, Graybar filed its notice of\nappeal in cause number 13-08-00341-CV on June 12, 2008.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Appellate Jurisdiction\nSection 51.014(a)(4) of the civil practice and remedies code provides this Court with interlocutory appellate jurisdiction if the\ndistrict court “grants or refuses a temporary injunction or grants or overrules a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction....”\nId. § 51.014(a)(4) (Vernon 2008). Here, the trial court denied Graybar's motion to dissolve or modify an injunction. Therefore,\nwe have jurisdiction over Graybar's interlocutory appeal. See id.\n\n\nB. Standard of Review\nWhether to dissolve a temporary injunction is a matter lying within the trial court's discretion. Cellular Mktg., Inc. v. Houston\nCellular Tel. Co., 784 S.W.2d 734, 735 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, no writ); Tober v. Turner of Tex., Inc., 668\nS.W.2d 831, 834 (Tex.App.-Austin 1984, no writ). On appeal, our review is limited to the question of whether the trial court\nabused its discretion in denying Graybar's motion to dissolve. Walling v. Metcalfe, 863 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex.1993). A clear\nfailure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an abuse of discretion. Walker v. Packer, 827\nS.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex.1992) (orig.proceeding).\n\n *4 The trial court may modify a temporary injunction because of fundamental error or changed circumstances, but it has no\nduty to reconsider the grant of a temporary injunction if the movant fails to present new evidence showing fundamental error or\nchanged circumstances. Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. Thompson, 24 S.W.3d 570, 580 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, no pet.) (citing\nHenke v. Peoples State Bank, 6 S.W.3d 717, 721 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.)). Fundamental error exists\nwhen “the record shows the court lacked jurisdiction or that the public interest is directly and adversely affected as that interest\nis declared in the statutes or the Constitution of Texas.” Pirtle v. Gregory, 629 S.W.2d 919, 920 (Tex.1982). On the other hand,\nchanged circumstances “are conditions that altered the status quo existing after the temporary injunction was granted or that\nmade the temporary injunction unnecessary or improper.” Henke, 6 S.W.3d at 721.\n\n\nC. Discussion\n\n1. Graybar's Mechanic's Lien in Webb County\nIn its first issue, Graybar asserts that the Hidalgo County district court did not have jurisdiction over its Webb County claims\npursuant to section 53.157 of the Texas Property Code. See TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 53.157(2). Specifically, Graybar\ncontends that Webb County is the only county in which its foreclosure suit can be brought and maintained because that is where\nthe property is located. On the other hand, Gonzalez and Laredo Hix argue that section 53.157 of the property code relates to\nvenue of a mechanic's lien foreclosure suit and not to subject matter jurisdiction. They further argue that the injunction issued\nby the Hidalgo County district court does not require that Graybar pursue its mechanic's lien foreclosure suit in Hidalgo County.\n\nSection 53.157 of the property code provides, in relevant part: “A mechanic's lien or affidavit claiming a mechanic's lien filed\nunder Section 53.052 may be discharged of record by ... failing to institute suit to foreclose the lien in the county in which\nthe property is located....” Id. § 53.157(2) (emphasis added). 10 Moreover, section 53.154 states that “[a] mechanic's lien may\nbe foreclosed only on judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction foreclosing the lien and ordering the sale of the property\nsubject to the lien.” Id. § 53.154 (Vernon 2007).\n\nIt is undisputed that Graybar perfected its mechanic's lien by filing an affidavit in the Webb County public records. The thrust of\nGraybar's argument pertaining to its mechanic's lien is that the Hidalgo County district court's issuance of the anti-suit injunction\nessentially forbids Graybar from foreclosing on its lien because the property code prevents it from instituting a foreclosure suit\nin Hidalgo County. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               4\n\fIn re Graybar Elec.

GUERRERO D/B/A RIO DELTA ENGINEERING, PETE GALLEGOS PAVING, INC., SOLORIO\n  & ASSOCIATES, MARK STALLINGS ELECTRIC, INC., and their agents, representatives, attorneys and those acting\n  in concert therewith, are hereby immediately restrained from filing, initiating, serving any process, and from continuing\n  any litigation either criminal or civil against the Laredo HIX, LP and/or Alvaro Gonzalez, and their employees, agents and\n  representatives, except in this Court.\n\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Injunction shall be valid for the remainder of this litigation until a final\n  trial on the merits shall take place at 9 a.m., May 12, 2008.\n\nWe do not find and Graybar has not directed us to, anything in the record demonstrating that the Hidalgo County district court\naffirmatively asserted jurisdiction over Graybar's suit pertaining to its mechanic's lien. The effect of the anti-suit injunction was\nmerely to abate Graybar's foreclosure suit until a trial on the merits occurred in the Hidalgo County lawsuit. 11 See Golden\nRule Ins. Co. v. Harper, 925 S.W.2d 649, 651 (Tex.1996). We disagree with Graybar's contention that it has been “stripped\nof its right to bring suit to foreclose its lien.” Graybar has commenced its foreclosure suit in Webb County, and based on the\nrecord before us, there is nothing preventing Graybar from prosecuting its foreclosure suit after the Hidalgo County suit is\nresolved. Graybar has not provided any citations to authority supporting its argument that the resolution of the Hidalgo County\nlawsuit would eliminate its ability to ultimately foreclose on its mechanic's lien or that the court's injunction required Graybar\nto foreclose on its mechanic's lien in Hidalgo County. See TEX.R.APP. P. 38.1(h). Moreover, Graybar has not raised any issues\npertaining to changed circumstances. See Universal Health Servs., Inc., 24 S.W.3d at 580; Henke, 6 S.W.3d at 721. Therefore,\nwe do not find any fundamental error in the Hidalgo County district court's actions necessitating a modification or dissolution\nof the temporary injunction issued. Accordingly, we overrule Graybar's first issue.\n\n\n2. Section 65.023 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\nBy its second issue, Graybar asserts that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to issue the anti-suit injunction\npursuant to section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 65.023.\nSpecifically, Graybar argues that section 65.023 requires that any injunction must be filed in Webb County. See id. Conversely,\nGonzalez and Laredo Hix contend that section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code is not applicable because the\nHidalgo County lawsuit is not purely injunctive in nature. See id.\n\nThe principle of comity requires that courts exercise the power to enjoin foreign suits “sparingly, and only in very special\ncircumstances.” Harper, 925 S.W.2d at 651. An anti-suit injunction may be justified when the injunction will prevent a\nmultiplicity of suits or will protect a party from vexatious or harassing litigation. Christensen v. Integrity Ins. Co., 719 S.W.2d\n161, 163 (Tex.1986); see Gannon, 706 S.W.2d at 307; see also Harper, 925 S.W.2d at 651 (holding that an anti-suit injunction\nis appropriate: (1) to address a threat to the court's jurisdiction; (2) to prevent the evasion of important public policy; (3) to\nprevent a multiplicity of suits; or (4) to protect a party from vexatious or harassing litigation). The issuance of an anti-suit\ninjunction is within the sound discretion of the trial court. London Mkt. Insurers v. Am. Home Assurance Co., 95 S.W.3d 702,\n705-06 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2003, no pet.).\n\n*6 Graybar's second issue hinges upon the interpretation of section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code. See TEX.\nCIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 65.023. Specifically, section 65.023, entitled “Place for Trial,” provides:\n\n  (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), a writ of injunction against a party who is a resident of this state shall be tried in\n  a district or county court in the county in which the party is domiciled. If the writ is granted against more than one party, it\n  may be tried in the proper court of the county in which either party is domiciled.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\n\n\n  (b) A writ of injunction granted to stay proceedings in a suit or execution on a judgment must be tried in the court in which\n  the suit is pending or the judgment was rendered.\n\nId.\n\nGraybar contends that the Hidalgo County district court was powerless to enjoin the Webb County suit because section 65.023\nmandates that a writ of injunction had to be filed in Webb County. See id. We disagree.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court, in In re Continental Airlines, interpreted section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code,\nthe injunction venue statute. 988 S.W.2d 733 (Tex.1998) (orig.proceeding); see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. §\n65 .023. The supreme court noted that “the injunction venue statute applies only to suits in which the relief sought is purely or\nprimarily injunctive.” In re Continental Airlines, 988 S.W.2d at 736 (emphasis added) (citing Ex parte Coffee, 160 Tex. 224,\n328 S.W.2d 283, 287 (Tex.1959) (holding that the statute now codified as section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code\n“only applies to and governs the issuance and return of writs and trial in cases in which the relief sought is purely or primarily\ninjunctive.”)); see also In re Daniel, No. 12-06-00232-CV, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS 7207, at *7, 2006 WL 2361350 (Tex.App.-\nTyler Aug. 16, 2006, orig. proceeding) (suggesting that if the petition includes both a plea for declaratory judgment and an\ninjunction without any additional causes of action, then the primary purpose of the suit is injunctive in nature). Furthermore,\nthis Court has held in similar circumstances that when “[t]he injunction granted by the court below was ancillary in nature,”\nformer article 4656 does not apply. 12 Ray v. Paulus, 489 S.W.2d 446, 449-50 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1972, no writ).\n\nThis case is not purely injunctive in nature. In fact, the Hidalgo County district court merely issued the injunction as a means\nto prevent a multiplicity of suits and vexatious or harassing litigation. See id. at 450; see also Harper, 925 S.W.2d at 651. In\napplying Graybar's logic, no trial court would be able to obtain subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin another court from litigating\na matter unless the enjoined court agreed to be enjoined. This contention is not supported by case law on anti-suit injunctions.\nSee Harper, 925 S.W.2d at 651; Christensen, 719 S.W.2d at 163; Gannon, 706 S.W.2d at 305.\n\n *7 In support of its contention that section 65.023 prevented the Hidalgo County district court from enjoining the Webb County\nlawsuit, Graybar relies heavily on this Court's holding in Butron v. Cantu, 960 S.W.2d 91, 94-95 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi\n1997, no writ). However, we find the Butron decision to be factually distinguishable from this case.\n\nIn Butron, a district court in Cameron County rendered a judgment against an attorney for legal malpractice. Id. at 93. In response\nto this judgment, the attorney filed an action in Hidalgo County to declare the Cameron County judgment void and later sought\na temporary injunction to prevent collection on a supersedeas bond posted with the Cameron County district court. Id. The\nHidalgo County district court subsequently issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the collection of the supersedeas bond.\nId. The issue on appeal was the propriety of the Hidalgo County district court's grant of the attorney's request for temporary\ninjunction. Id. at 94. This Court held that, since the Cameron County district court had rendered the judgment, only that court\ncould enjoin collection on the supersedeas bond. Id. at 95. There, injunctive relief was the primary relief sought by the attorney\nin Hidalgo County to “prevent [appellant] from executing on that [Cameron County] judgment.” Id. Moreover, this Court\nspecifically noted that “[s]ection 65.023 is intended to ensure that comity prevails among the various Texas trial courts because\n‘orderly procedure and proper respect for the courts will require that ... attacks upon their judgments should be made in the court\nrendering such judgment, rather than in other courts indiscriminately.’ ” Id. at 94 (quoting McVeigh v. Lerner, 849 S.W.2d 911,\n914 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied)).\n\nWe first note that Graybar has not secured a final judgment on its foreclosure suit in Webb County. Here, unlike Butron, the\ntemporary injunction sought by Gonzalez and Laredo Hix in Hidalgo County was not pursued for the purpose of preventing\nGraybar from collecting on a final judgment. 13 However, most importantly, the relief sought in the case at bar is not primarily\ninjunctive in nature. The temporary injunction in the present case is merely ancillary to the primary relief sought-damages\nassociated with various causes of action, including breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, pertaining to the management\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\nand construction of the Laredo Holiday Inn. See Karagounis v. Bexar County Hosp. Dist., 70 S.W.3d 145, 146-47 (Tex.App.-\nSan Antonio 2001, pet. denied) (holding that because the true nature of the relief being sought was not purely injunctive but\nfor specific performance of a contract, section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code did not apply). We believe this\ncase is akin to Ray. See 489 S.W.2d at 449-50. Contrary to Graybar's assertions, Texas courts have routinely authorized the\nissuance of anti-suit injunctions to prevent a multiplicity of suits and to prevent vexatious or harassing litigation. See Harper,\n925 S.W.2d at 651; Christensen, 719 S.W.2d at 163; Gannon, 706 S.W.2d at 305.\n\n *8 We therefore do not find any fundamental error in the Hidalgo County district court's issuance of the temporary injunction to\nmaintain the status quo. See Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex.2002) (stating that the purpose of a temporary\ninjunction is to preserve the status quo of the litigation's subject matter pending a trial on the merits); see also Harper, 925\nS.W.2d at 651; Christensen, 719 S.W.2d at 163; Gannon, 706 S.W.2d at 305. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion in issuing the anti-suit injunction and denying Graybar's motion. We overrule Graybar's second issue,\nand we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                            III. CAUSE NUMBER 13-08-00073-CV\n\nIn its first petition for writ of mandamus, Graybar argues that the Hidalgo County district court abused its discretion in denying its\nverified plea in abatement because the Webb County district court has dominant jurisdiction. Graybar also claims that Gonzalez\nand Laredo Hix engaged in impermissible “forum shopping.” Gonzalez and Laredo Hix argue that: (1) Hidalgo County has\ndominant jurisdiction over the Webb County lawsuit because suit was commenced there first and the claims are interrelated;\n(2) the Webb County lawsuit has not commenced because Laredo Hix has yet to be served; and (3) Graybar has not introduced\nany evidence to support an abatement of the Hidalgo County lawsuit. 14\n\n\nA. Standard of Review\nMandamus relief is available only to correct a “clear abuse of discretion” when there is no adequate remedy by appeal. Walker,\n827 S.W.2d at 839. Mandamus is appropriate to resolve disputes over dominant jurisdiction. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239,\n258 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding) (citing Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263, 268 (Tex.1974)). Moreover, mandamus relief may\nbe granted when one court actively interferes with the jurisdiction of another court. See In re Reliant Energy, Inc., 159 S.W.3d\n624, 626 (Tex.2005) (orig.proceeding).\n\nThe party bringing a plea in abatement must show: (1) the other suit (here, the Webb County lawsuit) commenced first; (2)\nthe suit is still pending; (3) the same parties are involved; and (4) the controversies are the same. S. County Mut. Ins. Co. v.\nOchoa, 19 S.W.3d 452, 468 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.) (op. on reh'g). The movant has the burden of proof to\nestablish the allegations in his motion to abate. Flowers v. Steelcraft Corp., 406 S.W.2d 199, 199 (Tex.1966); S. County Mut.\nIns. Co., 19 S.W.3d at 469.\n\nWe review the trial court's action in granting or denying a plea in abatement using an abuse of discretion standard. Wyatt v.\nShaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex.1988); Davis v. Guerrero, 64 S.W.3d 685, 691 (Tex.App.-Austin 2002, no pet.);\nS. County Mut. Ins. Co., 19 S.W.3d at 468. The trial court abuses its discretion when it acts in an unreasonable and arbitrary\nmanner, or without reference to any guiding rules or principles. See Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238,\n241-42 (Tex.1985).\n\n\nB. The Doctrine of Dominant Jurisdiction & Venue\n *9 The dominant jurisdiction doctrine applies when venue is proper in two or more Texas counties or courts. Gonzalez v.\nReliant Energy, Inc., 159 S.W.3d 615, 622 (Tex.2005) (noting that the concept of dominant jurisdiction is not applicable in\ncases where venue is not proper in more than one Texas county); Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 248. Dominant jurisdiction recognizes\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                7\n\fIn re Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\n“the plaintiff's privilege to choose the forum” and accepts that choice as correct, provided “the forum is a proper one.”\nGonzalez, 159 S.W.3d at 622; Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 248; see Cleveland v. Ward, 116 Tex. 1, 285 S.W. 1063, 1070 (Tex.1926)\n(orig.proceeding), disapproved on other grounds by Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 843.\n\n“The long-standing common law rule in Texas is that the first court to acquire jurisdiction over the subject matter and the\nparties of a controversy has dominant jurisdiction over all other courts.” San Miguel v. Bellows, 35 S.W.3d 702, 704 (Tex.App.-\nCorpus Christi 2000, pet. denied) (citing Cleveland, 285 S.W. at 1070); see Curtis, 511 S.W.2d at 267. “Where jurisdiction of a\ndistrict court has attached, it has the power to permit pleadings to be amended, new parties to be made, to determine all essential\nquestions, and to do anything with reference thereto authorized by law.” San Miguel, 35 S.W.3d at 704 (citing Cleveland, 286\nS.W. at 1069). Dominant jurisdiction excludes other courts from exercising jurisdiction over the same case. Curtis, 511 S.W.2d\nat 267; San Miguel, 35 S.W.3d at 704.\n\nDominant jurisdiction requires “an inherent interrelation of the subject matter” in the two suits before a plea in abatement must\nbe granted in the second action. Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 248. It is not required that the exact issues and all the parties be included\nin the first action before the second action is filed, provided that the claim in the first suit may be amended to bring in all\nnecessary and proper parties and issues. Id. at 247. In determining whether an inherent interrelationship exists, courts should\nbe guided by the rule governing persons to be joined if feasible and the compulsory counterclaim rule. Id.\n\n\nC. Discussion\nIt is undisputed that the Hidalgo County district court has general subject matter jurisdiction over all claims involved. See\nTEX. CONST. art. V, § 8 (providing that the district court has exclusive, original jurisdiction of “all actions, proceedings, and\nremedies,” except when the constitution or other law confers jurisdiction on some other court); TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN . §\n24.007 (Vernon 2000) (“The district court has the jurisdiction provided by Article V, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution.”); see\nalso Gordon v. Jones, 196 S.W.3d 376, 381-82 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.). Moreover, Graybar acknowledges\nin its plea in abatement that the “Webb County Lawsuit is clearly inherently interrelated with the Hidalgo County Lawsuit....\nBoth have the same subject matter-the HOLIDAY INN-LAREDO.” See Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 248. Therefore, the only issue\nbefore us is which suit was filed first.\n\n *10 HMC filed its original petition with the Collin County district court on January 18, 2007, asserting various causes of\naction pertaining to an alleged breach of several hotel management agreements regarding the Laredo Holiday Inn. The lawsuit\nwas transferred to Hidalgo County on May 21, 2007. It was not until September 24, 2007, that Graybar filed its suit in Webb\nCounty to foreclose upon its mechanic's lien. Clearly, the Hidalgo County lawsuit was filed first.\n\nWhen suit is proper in more than one county, the court in which the suit is first filed acquires dominant jurisdiction. Wyatt,\n760 S.W.2d at 248. As long as the forum is proper, it is the plaintiff's privilege to choose the forum. Id. “Defendants are not\nat liberty to decline to do battle in the forum chosen by the plaintiff.” Id. Therefore, because the parties agree that the claims\nare interrelated and because the Hidalgo County lawsuit was filed first, we conclude that the Hidalgo County district court has\ndominant jurisdiction over the Webb County suit. 15\n\nGraybar, however, relies heavily on this Court's holding in San Miguel to support its contention that Webb County has dominant\njurisdiction over the involved claims. 35 S.W.3d at 703-05. In that case, San Miguel obtained a judgment against R.D. Bellows\nLaw Office (“Bellows”) for damages of $513,000 in a Harris County district court. Id. at 703. After the judgment had become\nfinal, San Miguel filed an application for ancillary relief in the Harris County district court seeking a turnover order and joining\nBellows's wife, Suzette, and the Bellows Law Firm, P.L.L.C. Id. Subsequently, Suzette and the P.L.L.C. obtained an ex parte\ntemporary restraining order in Live Oak County to prevent San Miguel from proceeding with her collection efforts in Harris\nCounty. Id. at 704. Suzette and the P.L.L.C. also filed an application for temporary injunction and a petition for declaratory\njudgment. Id. This Court concluded that the Live Oak trial court abused its discretion in issuing a temporary injunction enjoining\nSan Miguel from pursuing her collection efforts against Bellows in the Harris County trial court. Id. at 703, 705.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              8\n\fIn re Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\n\n\nWe find this case to be factually distinguishable. Unlike San Miguel, Graybar has not secured a final judgment in Webb County.\nFurther, the purpose of the Hidalgo County district court's issuance of the temporary injunction and its denial of Graybar's plea\nin abatement was not to prevent Graybar from enforcing a final judgment. Additionally, as previously discussed, the claims\ninvolved are inherently interrelated and the Hidalgo County lawsuit was filed first; therefore, Hidalgo County has dominant\njurisdiction over the claims involved. Finally, the claims asserted by Suzette and the P.L.L.C. were merely injunctive in nature\nwhereas the claims asserted by Gonzalez and Laredo Hix in the Hidalgo County district court are not. See In re Continental\nAirlines, 988 S.W.2d at 736; see also In re Daniel, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS 7207, at *7, 2006 WL 2361350 (suggesting that if\nthe petition includes both a plea for declaratory judgment and an injunction without any additional causes of action, then the\nprimary purpose of the suit is injunctive in nature).\n\n *11 Graybar further argues that Gonzalez and Laredo Hix are engaging in impermissible “forum shopping.” See Reliant\nEnergy, Inc., 102 S.W.3d at 875 (“Forum shopping is against public policy....”). Graybar has not cited to any authority stating\nthat the Hidalgo County district court was required to abate the Hidalgo County lawsuit for impermissible “forum shopping.”\nIn any event, our review of the record does not yield a finding that Gonzalez and Laredo Hix engaged in impermissible “forum\nshopping.” Gonzalez and Laredo Hix joined Graybar and several other counter-defendants in the underlying Hidalgo County\nlawsuit because, as Graybar admits, these claims are interrelated.\n\nIn concluding that the Hidalgo County district court has dominant jurisdiction, we do not find that Graybar's Webb County\nforeclosure lawsuit is extinguished; instead, it is merely abated pending the resolution of the Hidalgo County lawsuit. Therefore,\nbased on the foregoing, we conclude that the Hidalgo County trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Graybar's motion\nto abate. Accordingly, we deny Graybar's petition for writ of mandamus.\n\n\n\n                                           IV. CAUSE NUMBER 13-08-00341-CV\n\nIn its second interlocutory appeal, Graybar asserts that the trial court erred in granting the motion to extend the November 2,\n2007 temporary injunction filed by Gonzalez and Laredo Hix. Specifically, Graybar contends that the temporary injunction\nshould be dissolved because: (1) it does not state the court's reason for issuing the injunction; (2) it does not describe the acts\nsought to be restrained; (3) the trial court did not give Graybar an opportunity to be heard, in violation of the Due Process Clause\nof the United States Constitution, see U.S. CONST. amend. XIV; and (4) the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction\nto issue the order and Webb County has dominant jurisdiction over the remaining claims.\n\nGonzalez and Laredo Hix argue that: (1) this Court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal; (2) Graybar's alleged procedural\nviolations do not apply to extensions of temporary injunctions; (3) Graybar has already raised the issues of subject matter\njurisdiction and dominant jurisdiction in cause number 13-08-00294-CV, its first interlocutory appeal; and (4) Graybar received\n“all the process to which it was due.”\n\n\nA. Applicable Law\nAn appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order unless a statute specifically authorizes such an appeal.\nQwest Commc'ns Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 336 (Tex.2000). Section 51.014 of the civil practice and remedies code\nprovides that a party may appeal from an interlocutory order of the trial court that “grants or refuses a temporary injunction.”\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014. Texas courts, however, have construed this provision to allow interlocutory\nreview of an amended order making a substantive modification to a temporary injunction. See Currie v. Int'l Telecharge, Inc.,\n722 S.W.2d 471, 472 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1986, no writ) (deciding that a temporary injunction was modified by restricting the\narea affected by a non-competition provision); Toby Martin Oilfield Trucking, Inc. v.

Ludewig v. Houston Pipeline Co., 737 S.W.2d 15, 16 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1987, no writ) (holding that the trial court's\norder amending a temporary injunction to include a new trial date is not an appealable order). We must determine whether the\nextension of the temporary injunction in this case amounted to a substantive modification.\n\n\nB. Discussion\n *12 The trial court's order extending the November 2, 2007 temporary injunction specifically incorporated by reference the\nsubstantive findings contained in the original November 2, 2007 temporary injunction. The lone change in the trial court's order\nwas to extend the duration of the injunction until the new trial setting of November 10, 2008. See City of Lancaster, 2005\nTex.App. LEXIS 7744, at *3, 2005 WL 2303415. As in City of Lancaster, no substantive changes were made to the November\n2, 2007 temporary injunction. See id.\n\nGraybar relies heavily on the decisions in EMC Mortgage Corp. v. Jones, No. 05-06-00419-CV, 2008 Tex.App. LEXIS 3270,\nat *5, 2008 WL 1960812 (Tex.App.-Dallas May 7, 2008, no pet.)

City of Nacogdoches,\n573 S.W.2d 297, 298-99 (Tex.Civ.App.-Tyler 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.) for the proposition that an extension is appealable because\nit is itself a temporary injunction. We disagree.\n\nThe EMC Mortgage Corp. case involved the trial court's extension of an underlying temporary injunction after a final judgment\nhad been secured. 2008 Tex.App. LEXIS 3270, 2008 WL 1960812 at ----9-10. The Dallas Court of Appeals concluded that once\na final judgment was secured, under the circumstances involved, the underlying temporary injunction terminated; therefore, the\nextension of the underlying temporary injunction constituted a new temporary injunction. Id. at *14. In this case, we do not\nhave a final judgment; instead, Graybar challenges the temporary injunction on interlocutory appeal, for which our jurisdiction\nis limited. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(4). Therefore, EMC Mortgage Corp. is not applicable.\n\nIn Webb, appellant Willis Webb appealed the trial court's extension of a temporary injunction ordering him to comply with\nprovisions on a covenant not to compete with his former employer. 793 S.W.2d at 303. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals\nreviewed the mertis of the temporary injunction without any discussion as to whether the trial court's extension of the temporary\ninjunction's duration constituted a substantive modification. Id. at 305. Here, we have a unique situation in that we have reviewed\nthe merits of the temporary injunction in cause number 13-08-00294-CV, Graybar's first interlocutory appeal. The only matter\nfor review in this cause is the extension. Therefore, we find City of Lancaster to be more on point in this cause, and we decline\nto follow Webb.\n\nFinally, in Herider Farm Processing, appellant appealed the trial court's issuance of a temporary injunction enjoining the City\nof Nacogdoches from terminating water and sewer services for a period of fifteen days. 573 S.W.2d at 297. After a hearing on\nthe temporary injunction, the trial court concluded that appellant was entitled to injunctive relief and granted appellant's motion\nfor a temporary injunction for a period of fifteen days from the date of the hearing. Id. at 298. Appellant subsequently filed a\nmotion for extension of the temporary injunction “until such time as the principal suit herein may be tried to a conclusion.” Id.\nThe trial court denied appellant's motion. Id. On appeal of the temporary injunction, the court of appeals noted that the crux of\nthe disagreement between appellant and appellee pertained to the length of time for which the trial court granted or should have\ngranted the injunction. Id. The court of appeals concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in granting the injunction\nfor only a fifteen day period, reasoning that fifteen days is insufficient to preserve the status quo. Id. at 299.\n\n *13 The Herider Farm Processing case is not directly analogous to the instant case. Although it was argued that the trial court\nhad abused its discretion in denying its motion to extend the temporary injunction, the court of appeals did not analyze the\ndenial of the motion to extend the temporary injunction. Id. at 298. Instead, the court analyzed the original temporary injunction\nthat the trial court had granted. Id. at 298-99. In doing so, the court concluded that the duration of the original temporary\ninjunction was insufficient to maintain the status quo of the underlying suit, especially in light of the trial court's conclusion\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\nthat appellant had proven its rights to permanent injunctive relief. Id. at 299. Therefore, the court modified the duration of the\noriginal temporary injunction to last until a trial on the merits. Id. Considering the court did not address appellant's motion to\nextend the temporary injunction and instead addressed the trial court's grant of the original temporary injunction, we do not\nfind this case to be persuasive in this matter. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(4) (providing for an\ninterlocutory appeal premised on a grant or refusal to issue a temporary injunction).\n\nGraybar further argues that the holdings in Sweet v. Inkjet International, Ltd., No. 05-03-00233-CV, 2003 Tex.App. LEXIS\n8539, 2003 WL 22254695 at ----6-8 (Tex.App.-Dallas Oct.2, 2003, no pet.) (mem.op.) (concluding that the trial court's amended\ntemporary injunction clarifying the term “contacting” constituted a second temporary injunction and, therefore, did not interfere\nwith the appellate court's jurisdiction), Ahmed v. Shimi Ventures, 99 S.W.3d 682, 688-89 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2003,\nno pet.) (holding that an order modifying a temporary injunction, including adding a provision applicable to insurers, reducing\nbond, and changing some compliance dates, but not incorporating the original temporary injunction by reference was a complete\ntemporary injunction in itself), and Martin, 640 S.W.2d at 355 (involving a modified temporary injunction increasing the bond\namount in the original temporary injunction from $2,000 to $100,000) support its contention that in changing the date of the\ntemporary injunction, the Hidalgo County district court made a substantive modification to the November 2, 2007 temporary\ninjunction. We disagree.\n\nNone of the cases cited by Graybar address a situation where a trial court has extended a temporary injunction. Furthermore,\nnone of the cases cited by Graybar stand for the proposition that a mere changing of the date on the temporary injunction to\neffectuate an extension constitutes a substantive modification. Thus, the cases relied upon by Graybar are not persuasive in\nthis matter.\n\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that the order falls outside the ambit of section 51.014(a)(4) of the civil practice and\nremedies code, and that we do not have jurisdiction to review it. See id.; see also TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 51.014(a)\n(4). On June 10, 2008, Gonzalez and Laredo Hix moved to dismiss this appeal. Accordingly, we grant the motion to dismiss\nfiled by Gonzalez and Laredo Hix, and we dismiss this interlocutory appeal. 16\n\n\n\n                                            V. CAUSE NUMBER 13-08-00333-CV\n\n *14 In a second petition for writ of mandamus, Graybar, MIRA, and Stallings assert that the trial court abused its discretion\nin denying their motions to transfer venue. Specifically, they argue that sections 15.011 and 15.012 of the civil practice and\nremedies code are mandatory venue provisions which necessitate trying the entire case in Webb County. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n& REM.CODE ANN. §§ 15.011, 15.012 (Vernon 2002). Gonzalez and Laredo Hix counter by arguing that: (1) the mandatory\nvenue provisions noted by Graybar do not apply because venue in this case is governed by section 15.062 of the civil practice\nand remedies code, see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 15.062 (Vernon 2002); (2) Graybar and MIRA are barred\nfrom obtaining a writ of mandamus because of waiver; and (3) section 15.011 does not apply because the underlying suit does\nnot involve the recovery of property or quieting title, see id. § 15.011.\n\n\nA. Standard of Review\nAs previously stated, the general rule is that mandamus relief is available only to correct a “clear abuse of discretion” when there\nis no adequate remedy by appeal. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 839. However, section 15.0642 of the civil practice and remedies code\nprovides that “[a] party may apply for a writ of mandamus with an appellate court to enforce the mandatory venue provisions\nof this chapter.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 15.0642 (Vernon 2002); see id. § 15.064 (Vernon 2002) (“No\ninterlocutory appeal shall lie from the determination [of a motion to transfer venue].”). The Texas Supreme Court has held\nthat parties bringing a mandamus under section 15.0642 to enforce the mandatory venue provisions of the civil practice and\nremedies code need not demonstrate that they lack an adequate remedy by appeal. In re Mo. Pac. R.R., 998 S.W.2d 212, 215\n(Tex.1999) (orig.proceeding) (citing In re Continental Airlines, 988 S.W.2d at 735). Instead, the supreme court concluded that\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             11\n\fIn re Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\na party need only demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion. Id. at 216. Therefore, Graybar has properly raised this\nissue in its second petition for writ of mandamus.\n\n\nB. Discussion\nRule 86 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[a]n objection to improper venue is waived if not made by written\nmotion filed prior to or concurrently with any other plea, pleading or motion except a special appearance motion....” TEX.R.\nCIV. P. 86(1).\n\n\n1. Graybar\nGraybar was first joined as a party to this matter when Laredo Hix filed its original petition in intervention and Gonzalez\nfiled his supplemental counterclaim on October 9, 2007. Graybar filed its motion to partially dissolve or modify the November\n2, 2007 temporary injunction entered by the Hidalgo County trial court and its verified plea in abatement. Subsequently, on\nNovember 20, 2007, Graybar filed its motion to transfer venue and original answer subject thereto, contending that section\n15.011 of the civil practice and remedies code mandated venue in Webb County. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN.\n§ 15.011. On March 19, 2008, Graybar filed a supplement to its November 20, 2007 motion to transfer venue, asserting that\nsection 15.012 of the civil practice and remedies code also mandated venue in Webb County. See id. § 15.012; cf. In re Pepsico,\nInc., 87 S.W.3d 787, 794 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2002, orig. proceeding) (“[A]n original timely motion to transfer venue may\nbe amended to cure defects in the original motion if the amended motion is filed before the trial court rules on the original\nmotion, and that the properly filed amended motion relates back to and supersedes the original motion to transfer venue.”).\nBecause Graybar filed its motion to dissolve or modify the temporary injunction and verified plea in abatement prior to its\nmotion to transfer venue, we conclude that Graybar has waived this contention. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 86(1). Therefore, Graybar\nis not entitled to mandamus relief.\n\n\n2. MIRA\n *15 In its motion to transfer venue filed on November 1, 2007, MIRA contended that Eastland County was the proper venue\nfor this matter. At no point did MIRA allege that Webb County was the proper venue. Furthermore, MIRA did not make\nreference to either sections 15.011 or 15.012 of the civil practice and remedies code in arguing that venue was not proper in\nHidalgo County. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. §§ 15.011, 15.012. Because this petition for writ of mandamus\nspecifically alleges that sections 15.011 and 15.012 mandate venue in Webb County and because MIRA did not plead those\nprovisions in its motion to transfer venue and did not assert that venue should be in Webb County, we conclude that MIRA has\nwaived its venue contention. See TEX R. CIV. P. 86(3)(b) (providing that a motion to transfer venue must “state that the action\nshould be transferred to another specified county of proper venue because.... Mandatory venue of the action in another county\nis prescribed by one or more specific statutory provisions which shall be clearly designated or indicated ”) (emphasis added);\nWilson v. Tex. Parks & Wildlife Dep't., 886 S.W.2d 259, 260-61 (Tex.1994). Therefore, MIRA is not entitled to mandamus relief.\n\n\n3. Stallings\nStallings filed its original motion to transfer venue on November 1, 2007, asserting that section 15.011 mandated venue in Webb\nCounty . 17 See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 15.011. Stallings filed a first amended motion on November 1, 2007,\nand a second amended motion on November 15, 2007. 18 See In re Pepsico, Inc., 87 S.W.3d at 794. In its first amended motion\nto transfer venue, Stallings specifically denied Laredo Hix's and Gonzalez's venue facts suggesting that venue was proper in\nHidalgo County, and it contended that section 15.012 also mandated venue in Webb County. See id. § 15.012. Stallings filed\na motion requesting a hearing on its motion to transfer venue on November 1, 2007. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 87(1) (providing,\namong other things, that “[t]he movant has the duty to request a setting on the motion to transfer”). The Hidalgo County trial\ncourt denied all pending motions to transfer venue after a hearing on May 12, 2008. 19\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                           12\n\fIn re Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\nStallings argues that sections 15.011 and 15.012 mandate venue in Webb County. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN.\n§§ 15.011, 15.012. We disagree.\n\nSection 15.011 of the civil practice and remedies code provides that:\n\n            Actions for recovery of real property or an estate or interest in real property, for partition of real property,\n            to remove encumbrances from the title to real property, for recovery of damages to real property, or to\n            quiet title to real property shall be brought in the county in which all or a party of the property is located.\n\nId. § 15.011. 20 Additionally, section 15.012 of the civil practice and remedies code provides that “[a]ctions to stay proceedings\nin a suit shall be brought in the county in which the suit is pending.” Id. § 15.012.\n\n *16 We are, however, persuaded by the reasoning in Allison v. Fire Insurance Exchange, 98 S.W.3d 227, 241-44 (Tex.App.-\nAustin 2002, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.). In Allison, the Austin Court of Appeals analyzed the applicability of section\n15.011 of the civil practice and remedies code in a case involving actions for negligence, negligence per se, breach of contract,\ndeceptive trade practices, and breach of good faith and fair dealing in insurance claims handling pertaining to water damage\nand mold contamination of an entire house. Id.; see also TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 15.011. The Allison court\nstated the following:\n\n            When considering venue, we note that the legislature's use of the word “shall” in a statute generally\n            indicates the mandatory character of the provision. Because of the mandatory nature of section 15.011,\n            we will strictly construe it and will not hold that it applies unless [appellant's] suit falls clearly within\n            one of the categories in the section.\n\nAllison, 98 S.W.3d at 241 (internal citations omitted).\n\nHere, Stallings argues that the phrase “recovery of damages of real property” encompasses the claims made by Laredo Hix\nand Gonzales; therefore, venue is mandatory in Webb County. As the Allison court properly noted, “[i]f we were to look at\nthe words ‘recovery of damages to real property’ in isolation, we would concede that the phrase may be sufficiently broad to\nencompass the expansive reading urged by [appellee]. But we do not construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes\nas a whole.” Id . at 243. Furthermore, we must look to the “true” nature of the action to determine whether section 15.011\napplies. Id. (citing Renwar Oil Corp. v. Lancaster, 154 Tex. 311, 313, 276 S.W.2d 774, 775 (1955); Yzaguirre v. KCS Res.,\nInc., 53 S.W.3d 368, 371 (Tex.2001)).\n\n  Before the addition of the phrase “recovery of damages to real property,” the venue provision applied only when the suit\n  directly involved a question of title to land. See, e.g., Yzaguirre, 53 S.W.3d at 371 (mandatory venue provision does not\n  apply because suit does not involve recovery of real property or quieting title); Maranatha Temple, Inc. v. Enterprise Prods.\n  Co., 833 S.W.2d 736, 738 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied); Scarth v. First Bank & Trust Co., 711 S.W.2d\n  140, 141-42 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 1986, no writ). We have been cited to no authority that supports expanding the scope of\n  the provision beyond questions relating to the recovery of real property or affecting title to “land.” Except to make it explicit\n  that the provision in question allows for the recovery of damages in such a suit relating to land, there is no indication that\n  the legislature sought to broaden the provision with the addition of the phrase. That the phrase “for recovery of damages\n  to real property” was sandwiched between “to remove encumbrances from the title” and “to quiet title” further bolsters our\n  reading. Reading the relevant phrase in its entire context, then gives support for the more narrow interpretation. See 1 Scott\n  Brister, et al., Texas Pretrial Practice § 9.34 (2000).\n\n   *17 Were we to interpret the provision to allow for mandatory venue in all instances in which any damages are sought\n  relating to a dwelling, no matter the nature of the action, we believe we would be extending beyond permissible bounds\n  the statute's language.... The phrase must be understood against the background of what the legislature was attempting to\n  accomplish in restoring a damage provision to the section, thereby completing the availability of an array of remedies to\n  actions involving “land.”\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\n\n\nId.\n\nHere, Laredo Hix and Gonzalez brought actions against Stallings for breach of contract and negligence in carrying out its duties\nin the construction of the Laredo Holiday Inn. Stallings has not cited to any authority expanding the scope of section 15.011\nbeyond questions relating to the recovery of real property or affecting title to “land.” See Trafalgar House Oil & Gas Inc. v. De\nHinojosa, 773 S.W.2d 797, 798 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1989, no writ) (construing the identical statutory predecessor to section\n15.011 and concluding that “[i]t is not enough that the suit merely involves land; it must be a suit for the recovery of land or\ndamages thereto, or to quiet the title to land, or to prevent or stay waste on land.”) (quoting Canales v. Estate of Canales, 683\nS.W.2d 77, 81 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1984, no writ)). Because Laredo Hix's and Gonzalez's claims do not involve recovering\nreal property or quieting title or seeking damages for such loss, section 15.011 does not apply. See Allison, 98 S.W.3d at 244.\n\nMoreover, section 15.012 does not apply because we have previously concluded that the Hidalgo County district court has\ndominant jurisdiction over this matter and that the court was authorized to issue an anti-suit injunction with respect to the\npending Webb County claims in cause numbers 13-08-00294-CV and 13-08-00073-CV. See Fleming v. Ahumada, 193 S.W.3d\n704, 711-12 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2006, no pet.). Given that sections 15.011 and 15.012 do not apply in this case, we\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Stallings's motion to transfer venue. Accordingly, we deny\nStallings's petition for writ of mandamus.\n\n\n\n                                                         VI. CONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment in cause number 13-08-00294-CV, deny Graybar's petition for writ of\nmandamus in cause number 13-08-00073-CV, dismiss Graybar's appeal in cause number 13-08-00341-CV, and deny Graybar's\nsecond petition for writ of mandamus in cause number 13-08-00333-CV.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      This interlocutory appeal is accelerated. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(4) (Vernon 2008); TEX.R.APP.\n       P. 28.1.\n2      On appeal, Graybar raises a third issue pertaining to dominant jurisdiction. However, Graybar raised its dominant jurisdiction issue\n       with the Hidalgo County district court in its plea in abatement. In its first petition for writ of mandamus, Graybar takes issue with\n       the propriety of the Hidalgo County district court's denial of its plea in abatement. Therefore, we will address Graybar's dominant\n       jurisdiction issue in our analysis of its entitlement to a writ of mandamus in cause number 13-08-00073-CV.\n3      On June 12, 2008, Graybar filed a motion for leave with this Court to re-file its notice of appeal in cause number 13-08-00294-CV\n       and to file its notice of appeal in cause number 13-08-00341-CV. In conjunction with issuing this memorandum opinion, we GRANT\n       Graybar's motion for leave.\n4      Graybar was the supplier of electrical materials to the construction project.\n5      On February 26, 2008, HMC Hospitality Operating Company (“HMC”) filed an unopposed motion to dismiss its appeal against\n       Gonzalez. In this motion, HMC notified this Court that the parties in the original appeal had successfully mediated their claims and\n       that it sought to dismiss its appeal and that each party would pay its own costs. This Court subsequently granted HMC's motion to\n       dismiss in cause number 13-07-00518-CV on May 13, 2008.\n6      The record reflects that MIRA was the general contractor and Stallings was an electrical subcontractor.\n7      The record contains an affidavit executed by Gonzalez stating that he is the president of Laredo Hix.\n8      On appeal, Laredo Hix contends that it was never served with notice of the Webb County suit filed by Graybar; therefore, it argues,\n       the suit cannot be considered to have commenced against it.\n9      On January 18, 2008, Graybar filed notice of its accelerated interlocutory appeal of the trial court's January 2, 2008 order, in cause\n       number 13-07-00518-CV, essentially joining in HMC's original interlocutory appeal. Realizing its error, Graybar filed an emergency\n       expedited motion for severance on January 25, 2008. In this motion, Graybar moved this Court to sever its appeal from cause number\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\n       13-07-00518-CV and to docket its appeal under a distinct cause number. This Court granted Graybar's motion for severance and\n       assigned its interlocutory appeal a new cause number-13-08-00294-CV.\n10     Section 53.157 of the property code allows for the discharge of Graybar's mechanic's lien by five other methods besides failure to\n       institute a foreclosure suit in the county in which the property is located. See TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 53.157 (Vernon 2007). In\n       any event, Graybar has already filed suit to foreclose its mechanic's lien in Webb County. See id. § 53.158 (Vernon 2007) (providing\n       that “suit must be brought to foreclose the lien within two years after the last day a claimant may file the lien affidavit under Section\n       53.052 or within one year after completion, termination, or abandonment of the work under the original contract under which the\n       lien is claimed, whichever is later”); id. § 53 .052 (Vernon 2007) (providing that “the person claiming the lien must file an affidavit\n       with the county clerk of the county in which the property is located ... not later than the 15th day of the fourth calendar month after\n       the day on which the indebtedness accrues”).\n11     Gonzalez and Laredo Hix concede this fact on appeal.\n12     Section 65.023 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code is the successor to both former article 4656 of the Texas Revised\n       Civil Statutes and article 4653 of the “Revised Civil Statutes of Texas 1911.” Hughes v. Morgan, 816 S.W.2d 557, 559 (Tex.App.-\n       Fort Worth 1991, writ denied); see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 65.023 (Vernon 2008).\n13     Graybar also relies on Gardner v. Stewart, 223 S.W.3d 436, 437 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2006, pet. denied) and McVeigh v. Lerner, 849\n       S.W.2d 911, 914 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied) for the contention that section 65.023 prevented the Hidalgo\n       County district court from issuing the temporary injunction. Specifically, Graybar argues that section 65.023 requires a party seeking\n       to enjoin pending litigation “must do so where the litigation is pending.” However, like Butron v. Cantu, 960 S.W.2d 91, 94 (Tex.App.-\n       Corpus Christi 1997, no writ), the Gardner and McVeigh courts concluded that attacks on a judgment must be made in the court that\n       rendered the judgment and that a party cannot seek to enjoin a party from enforcing a judgment issued in another district court. See\n       Gardner, 223 S.W.3d at 437; McVeigh, 849 S.W.2d at 914. As we have previously noted, Graybar has not secured a judgment in the\n       Webb County lawsuit. Therefore, we do not find the Gardner or McVeigh cases to be persuasive in this matter.\n14     Gonzalez and Laredo Hix also assert that Graybar is not entitled to a writ of mandamus because it already has an adequate remedy\n       at law-its interlocutory appeal. As previously noted, Graybar took issue with the Hidalgo County district court's denial of its plea\n       in abatement in its petition for writ of mandamus, not in its interlocutory appeal. Moreover, section 51.014 of the civil practice and\n       remedies code does not grant this Court interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over a denial of a plea in abatement. See TEX. CIV.\n       PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014.\n          Appeal is ordinarily an adequate remedy to review incidental rulings such as pleas in abatement. See Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing\n          Co. ., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex.1988); see also In re Ayala, No. 13-07-140-CV, 2007 Tex.App. LEXIS 3319, at *6, 2007 WL\n          1238572 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi Apr.27, 2007, orig. proceeding). However, the Texas Supreme Court has held that mandamus is\n          appropriate to resolve disputes over dominant jurisdiction. See Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 258 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding)\n          (citing Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263, 268 (Tex.1974)). In addition, the supreme court, in Abor v. Black, denied mandamus relief\n          requesting a court to abate a case in deference to another court's dominant jurisdiction absent “any order [of the former court] which\n          actively interferes with the exercise of jurisdiction” by the court with dominant jurisdiction. 695 S.W.2d 564, 567 (Tex.1985). The\n          supreme court has not resolved these tests into one uniform test governing mandamus relief pertaining to dominant jurisdiction\n          issues. Here, the Webb County district court set a hearing for December 6, 2007, to resolve an emergency plea in abatement and a\n          motion filed by Stallings to dissolve or modify the November 2, 2007 temporary injunction. Clearly, the setting of the December\n          6, 2007 hearing date by the Webb County district court interferes with the exercise of jurisdiction by the Hidalgo County district\n          court. Under either test, Graybar does not have an adequate remedy by appeal and, therefore, it properly raised this issue in its\n          petition for writ of mandamus. See Perry, 66 S.W.3d at 258; Abor, 695 S.W.2d at 567.\n15     Though Graybar did, in fact, institute its Webb County suit before Laredo Hix's plea in intervention, we must refer to the original\n       Hidalgo County suit filed on January 18, 2007. See Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 247. This is so because Laredo Hix, through its plea in\n       intervention, effectively amended the Hidalgo County suit to join all necessary parties, and Graybar did not challenge the joinder in\n       the trial court. See id.; see also TEX.R. CIV. P. 39 (providing that a person subject to service of process shall be joined as a party if (1)\n       in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded to those already made parties or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of\n       the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in its absence may “(i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability\n       to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or\n       otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest”); R. 40 (providing that defendants may be joined in one action if\n       the assertions against them arise “out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question\n       of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action.”).\n16     Given our disposition, we need not address Graybar's remaining issues in cause number 13-08-00341-CV. See TEX.R.APP. P. 47.1.\n17     The November 1, 2007 motion to transfer venue was the first pleading filed by Stallings in the trial court; therefore, we do not have\n       for review any issues pertaining to the due order of pleading rule with respect to Stallings.

P.L.L.C. v. Xenon Health L.L.C., No. 09–12–00553–CV, 2013 WL 1279408, at *4 (Tex.App.-\nBeaumont Mar.28, 2013, no pet.) (mem.op.). Khan argues the temporary injunction orders are void because the trial court\ngranted Khan's motion for continuance and re-set the trial date to a later date than the trial dates contained in the temporary\ninjunction orders. The trial court reset the trial date for February 10, 2014. Khan asks this Court to issue a temporary stay of the\ntrial court proceedings and to issue a writ of mandamus directing the trial court (1) to vacate its order setting the show cause\nhearing, and (2) to dissolve the temporary injunctions. See Tex.R.App. P. 52.8(c); see also Tex.R.App. P. 52.10(b).\n\nAfter reviewing the petition for writ of mandamus and the mandamus record, we conclude that the relator has not established an\nabuse of discretion by the trial court. See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135–36 (Tex.2004) (orig.proceeding);\nIn re CI Host, Inc., 92 S.W.3d 514, 516 (Tex.2002) (orig.proceeding).

During his confinement, Krueger filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and an emergency motion to\nset bond pending this Court's determination of the merits of the petition. We granted the emergency motion, ordered Krueger\nreleased upon the posting of bond, and requested a response from the real parties in interest, Michael Torres and Cru Energy,\nInc. (Cru Energy). A response was subsequently filed. Having considered the petition and response, we conclude that Krueger\nis entitled to relief. Accordingly, we will grant the petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n                                                       BACKGROUND\n\nKrueger and Torres are opposing parties in ongoing litigation involving Cru Energy, a company that they co-founded. In the\nunderlying suit, Krueger sued Torres for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, and other theories of recovery. Torres filed\nan answer and counterclaim in which he made similar allegations against Krueger. During the course of the litigation, Torres\nsought and obtained a temporary restraining order and two temporary injunctions against Krueger. The temporary restraining\norder, which was entered on June 14, 2011, and extended by agreement on July 27, 2011, prohibited Krueger from, among\nother things, “making or initiating any withdrawals or transfers from the Wells Fargo Account (as defined in Plaintiffs' Original\nPetition), excluding transfers to be made in the ordinary course of business of Cru Energy.” 1 The first temporary injunction,\nwhich was entered on July 5, 2011, and replaced the temporary restraining order, prohibited Krueger from:\n\n\n  (1) scheduling or providing notice of or conducting a shareholder's meeting;\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             1\n\fIn re Krueger, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n\n\n\n\n       (2) making or initiating any withdrawals or transfers from any of Cru Energy, Inc. bank accounts, including, but not\n          limited to, the Wells Fargo Account as defined in Plaintiffs' Original Petition;\n\n       (3) disposing of, selling or encumbering the shares or any assets of Cru Energy, Inc. to which Jeffrey Krueger claims\n          ownership;\n\n       (4) removing, destroying, or otherwise making unavailable any written information or documents related to the\n          activities of any of Cru Energy, Inc.'s employees, agents, contractors, prospective or actual investors, customers or\n          governmental agencies and its employees, or any other person who may be directly or indirectly involved with the\n          affairs or business of Cru Energy, Inc.;\n\n       (5) contacting any of Cru Energy Inc.'s investors or potential investors, or any other persons doing business with or\n          potentially a participant in the business of Cru Energy, Inc., except as specifically authorized by Michael Torres.\n\n   The second temporary injunction, which was entered on July 15, 2011 and purports to supplement the first temporary\n      injunction, further ordered Krueger to “[r]eturn $80,000 to the Cru Energy bank account number 7038038340 to said\n      account no later than July 18, 2011,” to “[r]efrain and desist from denying or restricting Michael Torres' access to all\n      money in Cru Energy, Inc.'s bank account number 7038038340 or any other account in the name of Cru Energy, Inc. at\n      Wells Fargo Bank for usual and customary purposes of Cru Energy, Inc.,” and to “[r]efrain and desist from denying or\n      restricting Michael Torrres' access to or control over the Cru Energy, Inc. Website registered in the company's name....”\n *2 On January 18, 2012, Krueger filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Texas. Subsequently, Cru Energy filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court modified\nthe stay to allow Cru Energy to pursue criminal contempt charges against Krueger relating to his obligations under the temporary\norders. On September 6, 2012, following a hearing, Krueger was held in contempt for violating the temporary restraining order\nby making three cash withdrawals on June 17, 2011, totaling $3,091.21, from the Wells Fargo Account referenced in the order.\nKrueger was subsequently committed to the Travis County Jail for three consecutive days.\n\nIn November 2012, Cru Energy pursued additional contempt charges against Krueger relating to alleged violations of the first\ntemporary injunction. Cru Energy alleged that Krueger had violated the injunction by failing to cease and desist from either\ndirectly or indirectly “making or initiating any withdrawals or transfers from any of Cru Energy, Inc. bank accounts, including,\nbut not limited to, the Wells Fargo Account as defined in Plaintiffs' Original Petition.” Specifically, according to Cru Energy,\nKrueger admitted that he had “held $80,000 in trust for Cru Energy, Inc.” and that he had “withdrew and transferred all of that\nmoney in separate violations of the Temporary Injunction.”\n\nCru Energy also alleged that Krueger had further violated the injunction by failing to cease and desist from either directly or\nindirectly “contacting any of Cru Energy Inc.'s investors or potential investors, or any other persons doing business with or\npotentially a participant in the business of Cru Energy, Inc., except as specifically authorized by Michael Torres.” According\nto Cru Energy, Krueger had contacted “multiple investors, vendors, and potential contractors and employees of Cru Energy.”\nThese alleged contacts “includ[ed] but [were] not limited to”: (1) sending an email to several investors and potential contractors\nand employees of Cru Energy; (2) contacting and ultimately contracting with DSL, a vendor of Cru Energy; (3) contacting on\nmultiple occasions Pablo Cortez and Robert Cook, both of whom were employees of Cru Energy; (4) contacting an employee\nof Seva Energie, a vendor of Cru Energy; and (5) sending an email to Dr. Patrick Hayes, “an investor and potential vendor\nor customer” of Cru Energy.\n\nA hearing was held on the allegations. At the hearing, the district court admitted into evidence the transcript of the September\ncontempt hearing (but not the documentary evidence from that hearing) and took “judicial notice of its court file.” 2 The district\ncourt proceeded to consider additional evidence regarding the allegations, including the testimony of Krueger and former Cru\nEnergy employees Cook and Cortez. Documentary evidence was also admitted relating to Krueger's allegedly improper contacts,\nincluding copies of email messages and phone logs.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The district court further found that Krueger had also violated\nthe injunction by sending an email to several investors and employees of Cru Energy, sending an email to a vendor of Cru\nEnergy, and sending emails to Pablo Cortez, an employee of Cru Energy. For each violation, the district court committed\nKrueger to jail for five consecutive days, for a total term of confinement of 125 days. Krueger was immediately taken into\ncustody and confined to the Travis County jail. 3 This habeas-corpus proceeding followed.\n\n\n\n                                          STANDARD AND SCOPE OF REVIEW\n\nContempt is “broadly defined” as “disobedience to or disrespect of a court by acting in opposition to its authority.” In re\nReece, 341 S.W.3d 360, 364 (Tex.2011) (orig.proceeding) (citing Ex parte Chambers, 898 S.W.2d 257, 259 (Tex.1995)\n(orig.proceeding)). “[C]ontempt is a broad and inherent power of a court.” Id. (citing Ex parte Browne, 543 S.W.2d 82, 86\n(Tex.1976) (orig.proceeding)). However,\n\n             [D]espite the breadth of a court's contempt power, we have warned it is a tool that should be exercised\n             with caution. As the Court of Criminal Appeals has explained, “[c]ontempt is strong medicine”—the\n             alleged contemnor's very liberty is often at stake—and so it should be used “only as a last resort.”\n\nId. (internal citations omitted).\n\nAn order finding a party in contempt is not an appealable order. See Norman v. Norman, 692 S.W.2d 655, 655 (Tex.1985).\nTherefore, the only remedies available to the contemnor are obtaining a writ of mandamus if the contemnor is not confined, or\na writ of habeas corpus if, as here, the contemnor is subject to confinement. See In re Long, 984 S.W.2d 623, 625 (Tex.1999);\nEx parte Cardwell, 416 S.W.2d 382, 384 (Tex.1967). “The remedy [of habeas corpus] is in the nature of a collateral attack\nand its purpose is not to determine the ultimate guilt or innocence of the relator, but only to ascertain whether the relator has\nbeen unlawfully imprisoned.” Ex parte Gordon, 584 S.W.2d 686, 688 (Tex.1979). In a habeas-corpus proceeding, the order\nor judgment challenged is presumed to be valid until the relator has discharged his burden of showing otherwise. Ex parte\nOcchipenti, 796 S.W.2d 805, 809 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, orig. proceeding) (citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S.\n458, 468–69 (1938)). For the relator to be entitled to release from custody, “the trial court's order of commitment must be void,\neither because it was beyond the power of the court or because it deprived the relator of his liberty without due process of law.”\nEx parte Barnett, 600 S.W.2d 252, 254 (Tex.1980).\n\n *4 The amount of due process afforded to the contemnor depends on the type of contempt being charged. “Contempt\nmay occur in the presence of a court (direct contempt), or outside the court's presence (constructive contempt).” Reece, 341\nS.W.3d at 365 (citing Gordon, 584 S.W.2d at 688). Because constructive contempt occurs outside the court's presence, more\nprocedural safeguards are afforded to constructive contemnors, including notice, a hearing, and the opportunity to obtain an\nattorney. See Ex parte Krupps, 712 S.W.2d 144, 147 (Tex.Crim.App.1986); Ex parte Werblud, 536 S.W.2d 542, 546 (Tex.1976)\n(orig.proceeding). It is undisputed that the contempt alleged in this case, the violation of a written court order that occurred\noutside the court's presence, is constructive contempt. See Chambers, 898 S.W.2d at 259.\n\n“Contempt is further classified into either civil or criminal contempt.” Reece, 341 S.W.3d at 365. “Civil contempt in Texas is\nthe process by which a court exerts its judicial authority to compel obedience to some order of the court.” Ex parte Padron,\n565 S.W.2d 921, 924 (Tex.1978) (orig.proceeding). Once the contemnor obeys the court order, the contemnor is released from\nhis confinement. See Werblud, 536 S.W.2d 545. In other words, “the civil contemnor ‘carries the keys of his prison in his own\npocket.’ “ Id. (quoting Shillitani v. United States, 384 U .S. 364, 368 (1966)). “Criminal contempt[,] on the other hand[,] is\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                            3\n\fIn re Krueger, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n\n\npunitive in nature.” Id. “The sentence is not conditioned upon some promise of future performance because the contemnor is\nbeing punished for some completed act which affronted the dignity and authority of the court.” Id. Here, it is undisputed that\nKrueger was subject to criminal contempt, confined as punishment for his completed act of allegedly violating a court order\nand without the ability to obtain his release through compliance. See Reece, 341 S.W.3d at 365.\n\n“Many constitutional rights are accorded criminal contemnors.” Werblud, 536 S.W.2d at 547. This is because “criminal\ncontempt is a crime in every fundamental respect,” Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 201 (1968), and constitutional protections\nare required to ensure that the power to hold a person in contempt is not abused. See id. These rights include “full and complete\nnotification” of the charges and a “reasonable opportunity to meet the charges by way of defense or explanation,” Gordon, 584\nS.W.2d at 688, the right to assistance of counsel if requested, Ex parte Hiester, 572 S.W.2d 300, 302 (Tex.1978), the privilege\nagainst self-incrimination, Werblud, 536 S.W.2d at 547–48, and the right to a jury trial if the proposed punishment exceeds six\nmonths' imprisonment. Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488, 495 (1974); Werblud, 536 S.W.2d at 547.

We agree with Krueger that the temporary injunction he was alleged to have\nviolated is void for failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 683.\n\n“The law demands clear and complete orders granting injunctions.” Webb v.

(quoting Ex parte McManus, 589 S.W.2d 790, 793\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1979, no writ)). Rather, “the injunction must be in broad enough terms to prevent repetition of the evil\nsought to be stopped, whether the repetition be in form identical to that employed prior to the injunction or (what is far more\nlikely) in somewhat different form calculated to circumvent the injunction as written.” San Antonio Bar Ass'n v. Guardian\nAbstract & Title Co., 156 Tex. 7, 291 S.W.2d 697, 702 (Tex.1956). But an injunction “must not be so broad as to enjoin a\ndefendant from activities which are a lawful and proper exercise of his rights.” Hitt v. Mabry, 687 S.W.2d 791, 795 (Tex.App.-\nSan Antonio 1985, no writ) (citing Villalobos, 208 S.W.2d at 875).\n\nThe temporary-injunction provisions at issue in this case prohibited Krueger from: (1) “making or initiating any withdrawals\nor transfers from any of Cru Energy, Inc. bank accounts, including, but not limited to, the Wells Fargo Account as defined in\nPlaintiff's Original Petition”; and (2) “contacting any of Cru Energy Inc.'s investors or potential investors, or any other persons\ndoing business with or potentially a participant in the business of Cru Energy, Inc., except as specifically authorized by Michael\nTorres.” We conclude that neither provision complies with Rule 683.\n\nWe first address the prohibition against withdrawals or transfers from “any of Cru Energy, Inc. bank accounts, including, but\nnot limited to, the Wells Fargo Account as defined in Plaintiff's Original Petition.” This prohibition violates Rule 683 in two\nways. First, rather than describing in reasonable detail the Wells Fargo Account, the injunction describes the account solely by\nreference to a separate document, the petition, that contains identifying information regarding the account in question. Thus, the\npetition—not the injunction—provides the means of describing the act or acts sought to be restrained. This is a violation of Rule\n683's requirement that the injunction “describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or other document,\nthe act or acts sought to be restrained.” See Tex.R. Civ. P. 683 (emphasis added).\n\nIn its brief, Cru Energy acknowledges that “[a]t best, if transfer from that [Wells Fargo] account had formed the basis of the\ncontempt finding, it may have been subject to habeas corpus for that portion of the judgment.” However, Cru Energy contends\nthat the reference in the injunction to the Wells Fargo Account was “merely an example” of an account that Krueger was\nprohibited from accessing, and it “was irrelevant to the [contempt order] because it was not the account Relator transferred the\nmoney from and for which he was held in contempt.” 4 In other words, according to Cru Energy, the only possible problem\nwith the injunction is the reference to the Wells Fargo Account, which Krueger was not alleged to have accessed. Therefore, in\nCru Energy's view, if that portion of the injunction is found to be void, it does not affect the validity of the contempt order.\n\n *7 However, Cru Energy's argument overlooks the second way in which the prohibition violates Rule 683. In addition to\nimpermissibly describing the Wells Fargo Account by reference to another document, the entire prohibition on withdrawals\nand transfers fails to describe in reasonable detail the other accounts that Krueger is enjoined from accessing. The injunction\nprohibits Krueger from making withdrawals or transfers from “any” Cru Energy bank accounts, “including but not limited to”\nthe Wells Fargo Account. But the injunction does not describe in reasonable detail those other accounts. There are no account\nnumbers listed in the injunction, no identification of the banks in which the accounts exist, and no information describing the\nhistory or current status of the accounts. Thus, even if we were to disregard the portion of the injunction that referenced the\nWells Fargo Account, the injunction still violates Rule 683's requirements that the injunction “shall be specific in terms” and\n“shall describe in reasonable detail ... the act or acts sought to be restrained.” See Tex.R. Civ. P. 683.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              5\n\fIn re Krueger, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n\n\nCru Energy argues that the injunction “is in the most detail possible since Mr. Krueger would have to have known an account\nwhich fit that description in the injunction in order to be entitled to transfer money out of it” and that “Krueger himself established\nthe Cru account he took the funds out of after he acquired knowledge of the July 5, 2011 injunction.” However, Rule 683\nrequires that the injunction be as “definite, clear and precise as possible ... without calling on [the enjoined party] for inferences\nor conclusions about which persons might well differ and without leaving anything for further hearing.” Villalobos, 208 S.W.2d\nat 875. The injunction here, by not specifically identifying the off-limit accounts, required Krueger to make “inferences or\nconclusions about which persons might well differ” regarding the accounts he was prohibited from accessing and, consequently,\n“left for further hearing” the issue of whether withdrawals and transfers from certain accounts violated the injunction. 5 Thus,\nthe injunction failed to comply with the specificity requirements of Rule 683. See Computek Computer & Office Supplies, Inc.\nv. Walton, 156 S.W.3d 217, 222–23 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.) (holding that lack of specificity in injunction was not cured\nby any knowledge that enjoined party may have had).\n\nWe also disagree with Cru Energy's contention that the injunction was in “the most detail possible.” The second temporary\ninjunction, which Krueger was not alleged to have violated, specifically ordered Krueger to “[r]eturn $80,000 to the Cru\nEnergy bank account number 7038038340 to said account no later than July 18, 2011,” and to “[r]efrain and desist from\ndenying or restricting Michael Torres' access to all money in Cru Energy, Inc.'s bank account number 7038038340 or any other\naccount in the name of Cru Energy, Inc. at Wells Fargo Bank for usual and customary purposes of Cru Energy, Inc.” Thus,\nthe second injunction specifically identified the relevant bank accounts, leaving no doubt as to how Krueger was to comply\nwith the injunction. The first injunction, on the other hand, contained no such specificity. To comply with Rule 683, the first\ninjunction merely needed to “describe in reasonable detail” the bank accounts that Krueger was prohibited from accessing. See\nTex.R. Civ P. 683. This was not an impracticable requirement—providing the specific bank account names and numbers would\nhave sufficed. By not providing that or similar information identifying the specific accounts that Krueger was enjoined from\naccessing, the injunction failed to comply with Rule 683.\n\n *8 We next address the prohibition against Krueger “contacting any of Cru Energy, Inc.'s investors or potential investors, or\nany other persons doing business with or potentially a participant in the business of Cru Energy, Inc., except as specifically\nauthorized by Michael Torres.” This portion of the injunction violates Rule 683 by failing to describe in reasonable detail the\nindividuals or organizations that Krueger was prohibited from contacting. Specifically, the injunction fails to name or otherwise\nidentify those who are considered “investors or potential investors” of Cru Energy, and those who are “persons doing business\nwith or potentially a participant in the business of” Cru Energy.\n\nCru Energy argues that because of Krueger's role in running the company, he is “in a position to know who were investors\nand persons doing business with Cru [Energy].” Even assuming that this is true, 6 an injunction must be as “definite, clear and\nprecise as possible ... without calling on [the enjoined party] for inferences or conclusions about which persons might well\ndiffer and without leaving anything for further hearing.” Villalobos, 208 S.W.2d at 875. The above prohibition fails to inform\nKrueger of who he is enjoined from contacting, and it requires him to infer the identity of those individuals based on his then-\nexisting knowledge of the company's operations. This is similar to the injunction in Computek, 156 S.W.3d at 221–23, that was\nheld to violate Rule 683. In that case, OEM Supplies (OEM) and the owner of Computek, Michael Williams, were opposing\nparties in litigation involving Computek's alleged use of trade secrets to form a competing company in violation of a covenant\nnot to compete. Id. at 219–20. Computek had been permanently enjoined “from doing business, or authorizing anyone else to\ndo business, with any OEM client not listed on Attachment A or that was a new account set up while Williams worked for\nOEM.” Id. at 221. Although Attachment A listed some clients whom Computek could contact, the injunction did not name or\notherwise identify the clients whom Computek could not contact. Id. Computek contended that due to this lack of specificity, it\ncould not know whether contacting certain clients violated the injunction. Id. at 221–22. The appeals court agreed, explaining\nits reasoning as follows:\n\n\n  [T]hese paragraphs [of the injunction] enjoin Computek from taking specific actions involving specific OEM clients who are\n  not identified or listed in the permanent injunction, and from using or disclosing information and files that are not specifically\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                 6\n\fIn re Krueger, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n\n\n    identified in the permanent injunction. Because these OEM clients are not specifically named, we agree with Computek that\n    it must ask every non-ABBA contact it makes whether it was an OEM client during the relevant times, and that question may\n    be construed as “canvassing” or “soliciting,” and thus a violation of the permanent injunction. We agree with Computek that\n    the permanent injunction lacks specificity in this regard.\n     *9 Id. at 222. In response to OEM's argument that Computek “ha[d] the information as to the clients it may not contact ‘as\n    demonstrated by their repeated contacts of those clients,’ “ the appeals court observed,\n\n      [E]ven if the trial court had expressly found Computek had such information, rule 683 provides that the order granting an\n      injunction “shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail and not\n      by reference to the complaint or any other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained.” Thus, the injunction itself\n      must provide the specific information as to the off-limits clients, without inferences or conclusions, or, in this case, implied\n      references to other records Computek might have. Thus, we cannot agree with OEM that the lack of specificity as to OEM\n      clients is cured by any knowledge Computek may have outside the permanent injunction.\n\n  Id. at 222–23. Similarly, in this case, the injunction does not identify the individuals who Krueger is prohibited from\n  contacting, and it requires Krueger to make inferences or conclusions concerning whom those individuals are. In fact, this\n  injunction is even more vague than the injunction at issue in Computek, which at least provided a list of specific clients who\n  Computek could contact. See id. at 221. Krueger was not specifically informed of either whom he was allowed to contact\n  or whom he was enjoined from contacting.\nFor the above reasons, we conclude that the first temporary injunction violates the specificity requirements of Rule 683 and is,\naccordingly, void. 7 Consequently, the order finding Krueger in contempt for allegedly violating that injunction is also void.\nSee Shaffer, 649 S.W.2d at 301–02; In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d 268, 273 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding). It is\ntherefore unnecessary for us to address the other reasons why, in Krueger's view, the contempt order is void. See Gordon, 584\nS.W .2d at 689–90; Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273 n. 4. We grant Krueger's petition for writ of habeas corpus, vacate the district\ncourt's contempt order, and order Krueger discharged from custody and released from the bond set by this Court on December\n31, 2012.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      The “Wells Fargo Account” is described in Krueger's petition as follows:\n              The Board authorized a checking/banking account for CRU Energy with Wells Fargo Bank (the “Wells Fargo Account”). The\n              Board resolution authorizing the Wells Fargo Account provides that Mr. Krueger and Mr. Torres would both be authorized\n              signatories on the Wells Fargo Account.\n           Although no identifying account number was provided in the petition, the “Wells Fargo Account” was referenced multiple times\n           in the petition and formed the basis for Krueger's conversion theory against Torres. Krueger pled,\n              On or about October 1, 2010, Mr. Krueger attempted to electronically access the Wells Fargo Account. Mr. Krueger was able to\n              view the Wells Fargo Account, but was unable to conduct any transactions in it. When Mr. Krueger asked Mr. Torres about his\n              inability to access the Wells Fargo Account, he informed Mr. Krueger that he had Mr. Krueger's signature authority on the Wells\n              Fargo Account revoked. Mr. Torres said that he believed having too many persons with access to the Wells Fargo Account was\n              not consistent with how he wanted to handle CRU Energy's accounting functions.\n2       The record reflects that most of the evidence concerning the alleged withdrawals and transfers was admitted during the September\n        hearing.\n3       Krueger was confined from December 19, 2012, when he was taken into custody, through December 31, 2012, when this Court\n        ordered him released upon the posting of bond.\n4       We note that the contempt order did not specifically identify the account from which Krueger had transferred money in violation\n        of the injunction, other than as “the bank account holding Cru Energy, Inc. funds.” The record reflects that there was more than\n        one such account.\n5       The record of the September 6 contempt hearing reflects this problem. At the hearing, Krueger testified that at one point he withdrew\n        $160,000 from a Cru Energy bank account and transferred the funds into his personal account, which, Krueger claimed, was “linked”\n        to a Cru Energy bank account. He later withdrew $56,000 of those funds from his personal account and transferred the funds\n        into another account that, according to Krueger, was an “operating Cru Energy account” that he had opened at Bank of America\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                      7\n\fIn re Krueger, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2013)\n\n\n      without authorization from Michael Torres. At another point in his testimony, Krueger admitted to withdrawing $80,000 from “a\n      Cru Energy bank account,” but claimed that the trial court “didn't specifically say that I wouldn't have access to that account.”\n      Without specificity in the injunction, questions remain as to which particular accounts qualify as “Cru Energy, Inc. bank accounts”\n      for purposes of the injunction. For example, was Krueger's personal account considered a “Cru Energy, Inc. bank account” at the\n      time it contained $160,000 of Cru Energy funds? Similarly, was the Bank of America account, which Krueger testified he had opened\n      without authorization from Torres, actually a “Cru Energy, Inc. bank account” or, due to the lack of authorization, was it another one\n      of Krueger's personal accounts? Such questions can be answered only by drawing inferences and conclusions based on information\n      not contained within the injunction.\n6     There is some authority for the proposition that, at least in the context of covenants not to compete, injunctions generally restraining\n      solicitation of customers and not specifically listing the individual customers are not impermissibly vague. See Safeguard Bus. Sys.,\n      Inc. v. Schaffer, 822 S.W.2d 640, 644–45 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1991, no writ). This is because, in that context, it is not “unreasonable to\n      assume that he who is sought to be enjoined is sufficiently familiar with the employer's business and its customers to avoid violating\n      the injunction.” Id. This case presents a different situation. First, Krueger is prohibited from contacting not merely current investors\n      and persons currently doing business with Cru Energy, but also “potential” investors and “potential” participants in the business.\n      Additionally, despite whatever role Krueger may have had in Cru Energy in the past, the record reflects that during the ongoing\n      litigation, Michael Torres has been making business decisions for the company, and there is no indication in the record that Torres\n      has notified Krueger of whom Torres might be soliciting to become an “investor or potential investor in” Cru Energy, or of whom\n      Torres might be considering to become “a person doing business with or potentially a participant in the business of” Cru Energy.\n      Thus, it would not be reasonable on the facts of this case to assume that Krueger is sufficiently familiar with Cru Energy's investors,\n      potential investors, and “any other persons doing business with or potentially a participant in the business of” Cru Energy, to avoid\n      violating the injunction.\n7     In its brief, Cru Energy asserts that if there is a lack of specificity in the injunction, the defect would render the injunction merely\n      voidable (and therefore subject to attack only on direct appeal) as opposed to void. We disagree. The Texas Supreme Court has\n      repeatedly stated that an injunction that fails to strictly comply with the requirements of Rule 683 and other rules of civil procedure\n      is subject to being declared void. See, e.g., In re Office of Attorney Gen., 257 S.W.3d 695, 697–98 (Tex.2008) (per curiam); Qwest\n      Commc'ns Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 337 (Tex.2000) (per curiam); Interfirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr. Co.,\n      715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.1986) (per curiam); Lancaster v. Lancaster, 155 Tex. 528, 291 S.W.2d 303, 308 (Tex.1956); see also\n      In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d 268, 271–73 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding) (rejecting contention that injunction which\n      failed to comply with procedural requirements was merely voidable and observing that “[i]f the supreme court had meant that such\n      a temporary injunction was voidable, we feel certain it would have used the word ‘voidable.’ Instead, the court has repeatedly used\n      the word ‘void’ ”).\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The first case was assigned to the 197th District Court, Migdalia Lopez, J., but the plaintiffs successfully moved\nto transfer and consolidate all cases to the 404th District Court, Abel Limas, J., and some defendants thereafter successfully move\nto transfer and consolidate all cases in the 197th District Court. The 103rd District Court, Menton Murray, Jr., J., transferred\nto the 197th District Court. The 138th District Court, Robert Garza, J., entered an anti-transfer order. The 357th District Court,\nLeonel Alejandro, J., recused and transferred to the 107th District Court, Benjamin Euresti, J., which took no further action.\nThe 404th District Court, Abel Limas, J., rescinded its consolidation order and blocked any transfer of the case originally filed\nin that court.

Bryant, *437 Steve A. Bryant & Associates, P.C., Houston, for Real Parties.\n\nOpinion\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\nTen silicosis cases involving hundreds of plaintiffs were filed in Cameron County and randomly assigned to six different courts.\nAt the behest of different parties, three judges issued conflicting orders asserting jurisdiction over cases in their own courts or\nothers. Because the Cameron County local rules permit a unilateral transfer only by the court where the first case was filed, we\nconditionally grant a writ of mandamus directing the others to vacate orders forbidding that transfer.\n\nOn May 30, 2003, a single attorney filed ten silicosis lawsuits in Cameron County. The allegations in each were identical, as\nwere the 82 defendants. Only the plaintiffs varied—each suit included about 70, for a total of almost 700.\n\nThe cases were randomly assigned among the six district courts in Cameron County. Though all were file-stamped with the\nsame time, consecutive cause numbers indicate the first case filed was assigned to the 197th District Court (Judge Migdalia\nLopez presiding).\n\nThereafter ensued a scramble for possession. First on the field were the plaintiffs, who kicked things off by moving to transfer\nand consolidate all ten cases in the 404th District Court (Judge Abel Limas presiding). That motion was granted on January 6th.\n\nClose behind came some of the defendants, who countered by moving to consolidate all ten cases in the 197th District Court,\nwhere the first case was filed. That motion, too, was granted on January 7th.\n\nThe reaction of the remaining courts varied. The 103rd District Court (Judge Menton Murray, Jr. presiding) took the second\noption, lateraling cases to the 197th District Court. The 138th District Court (Judge Robert Garza presiding) blocked, entering\nan anti-transfer order because no one had requested his consent. The 357th District Court (Judge Leonel Alejandro presiding)\npunted, signing a recusal order and transferring cases to the local administrative judge. That court, the 107th District Court\n(Judge Benjamin Euresti presiding), remained on the sidelines, taking neither offensive nor defensive action in the proceedings.\n\nAt this point, some of the contestants reversed field. Judge Limas rescinded his original consolidation order, but also signed an\norder blocking any transfer of the case originally filed in his court. Eventually, the plaintiffs followed suit, seeking to return all\ncases to the courts where originally filed, except for those transferred by recusal from the 357th.\n\n [1] Unable to determine the winner of these jurisdictional contests, the relators sought mandamus relief from the Thirteenth\nCourt of Appeals. That court declined to referee, holding the proper umpire was the local administrative judge. 129 S.W.3d 810,\n814. The court of appeals relied on a provision of the Texas Government Code that assigns to local administrative judges the\nstatutory duty (among others) to “implement and execute the local rules of administration, including the assignment, docketing,\ntransfer, and hearing of cases.” Tex. Gov't Code § 74.092(1).\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                3\n\fIn re U.S. Silica Co., 157 S.W.3d 434 (2005)\n48 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 411\n\nWe disagree that this statute gives local administrative judges authority to review and reverse conflicting rulings of coordinate\ncourts like those issued here. While the local administrative judge may transfer cases pursuant to local rules, enforcing or\noverruling competing orders is the duty of a higher court.\n\n*438 [2] In this case, the Cameron County rules allow transfer of related cases to the court in which filing was first made\nwithout the consent of any other judge:\n\n             Whenever any pending case is so related to another case previously filed in or disposed of by another\n             District Court of Cameron County that a transfer of the later case to such other court would facilitate\n             orderly and efficient disposition of the litigation, the Judge of the court in which the earlier case is or\n             was pending may, on notice and hearing, transfer the later case to such court.\n\nCameron County Civ.Ct. R. 1.1(f)(2). The local rules permit the first-filed case to be transferred to a court with a later-filed\ncase, but only with the first judge's consent:\n\n             In the event that an assigned case is subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1.1(f)(2) and (3) and the\n             earlier case is still pending, the judge of the court wherein the later case is pending may on notice and\n             hearing order the earlier case transferred to the later court provided that the judge of the court wherein\n             the earlier case is assigned consents.\n\nId. at 1.1(f)(5). Under these rules, only the 197th court could transfer cases unilaterally.\n\nAs the relators challenge only the conflicting transfer orders, the propriety of consolidating such a large number of claims is\nnot before us. See In re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d 203, 207–10 (Tex.2004) (holding consolidation was abuse of\ndiscretion based on “Maryland factors”); see also In re Bennett, 960 S.W.2d 35, 40 (Tex.1997) (holding that a scheme designed\nto subvert random case assignment “breeds disrespect for and threatens the integrity of our judicial system.”).\n\nWhile we have encouraged consolidation for pretrial purposes (most recently pursuant to legislative mandate), we have avoided\nplacing such decisions in the hands of one of the players. See generally Tex. Gov't Code § 74.161–63; Tex.R. Jud. Admin.\n11.4(h) (appointment by regional administrative judge), 13.3 (appointment by multidistrict litigation panel). Local consolidation\nrules have made similar arrangements to avoid the awkward problem of one court taking a case from another. See, e.g., CSR Ltd.\nv. Link, 925 S.W.2d 591, 594 (Tex.1996) (noting adoption by Harris County courts of rules for and appointment of presiding\njudge in asbestos cases).\n\nBut the only issue before us is which court, if any, could unilaterally transfer to itself related Cameron County cases.\nAccordingly, we do not address whether the transfers here would (as the local rules also require) “facilitate orderly and efficient\ndisposition of the litigation.” Cameron County Civ.Ct. R. 1.1(f)(2).\n\n [3] We have long held that mandamus relief is appropriate to resolve conflicting orders from two or more courts asserting\njurisdiction over the same case. See Bigham v. Dempster, 901 S.W.2d 424, 428 (Tex.1995) (granting mandamus relief from\n“conflicting orders issued from different district courts”); see also Abor v. Black, 695 S.W.2d 564, 567 (Tex.1985); Curtis v.\nGibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex.1974). Accordingly, mandamus is appropriate here.\n\nThe relators also challenge certain interim orders signed by the 404th and 138th District Courts that set trial dates, ordered\nmediation, and set aside a number of default judgments. Relators argue that any orders signed after the consolidation in the\n197th District Court are void.\n\nWe disagree that all orders signed by a transferring court after transfer are void; many are not. See, e.g., *439 Tex. Fam.Code §\n155.005(a) (providing transferring court retains jurisdiction to render temporary orders); Tex.R. Jud. Admin. 13.5(b) (providing\ntransferring court in multidistrict litigation may make further orders on certain conditions); In re Bennett, 960 S.W.2d 35, 40\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 411\n\n(Tex.1997) (holding trial court retained power to sanction litigant after removal to federal court). This is especially true here\nbecause the transfers involved district courts in a single county.\n\n [4] Trial courts have broad discretion to exchange benches and enter orders on other cases in the same county, even without\na formal order or transfer. Tex. Const. art. V, § 11 (“[T]he District Judges may exchange districts, or hold courts for each other\nwhen they may deem it expedient”); Tex. Gov't Code § 74.094(a); Tex.R. Civ. P. 330(h) (providing that in multi-court counties\n“any judge may hear and determine motions, ... and all preliminary matters, questions and proceedings and may enter judgment\nor order thereon in the court in which the case is pending without having the case transferred to the court of the judge acting”);\nIn re Houston Lighting & Power Co., 976 S.W.2d 671, 673 (Tex.1998). Given the broad powers district courts have to act for\none another, we do not agree that these orders were entered without jurisdiction.\n\nWe need not decide whether some post-transfer orders in cases transferred intra-county may qualify among the “rare\ncircumstances” that render an order void rather than merely voidable. Mapco, Inc. v. Forrest, 795 S.W.2d 700, 703 (Tex.1990).\nHere, the relators do not argue that the 197th District Court would be hampered by or unable to rescind any of the orders. Thus,\nwe decline to grant mandamus relief ordering that they be vacated. See Abor, 695 S.W.2d at 567 (declining to grant mandamus\nrelief when courts were not actively interfering with each other).\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.8 and without hearing oral argument, we direct the 138th and\n404th District Courts to vacate their orders of January 13, 2004, so that the 197th District Court may conduct further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. We are confident that the trial courts will promptly comply, and our writ will issue only if they\ndo not.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n48 Tex. Sup. Ct.

Co., 715 S.W.2d 640 (1986)\n\n\nThis is an appeal from an order granting a temporary injunction enjoining InterFirst Bank San Felipe from foreclosing a deed\nof trust lien securing payment of a promissory note. On appeal, InterFirst complained that the trial court's injunction order is\nvoid because it does not include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits. Finding no abuse of discretion in the trial\ncourt's decision to grant the temporary injunction, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court of appeals\nconcluded the trial court's failure to include an order setting the matter for trial on the merits did not mandate a dissolution\nof the injunction.\n\nRule 683 provides in pertinent part as follows:\n\n             *641 Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on\n            the merits with respect to the ultimate relief sought.\n\n\n [1] [2] The requirements of Rule 683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed. When a temporary injunction order does\nnot adhere to the requirements of Rule 683 the injunction order is subject to being declared void and dissolved. E.g., Northcutt\nv. Warren, 326 S.W.2d 10, 10 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1959, writ ref'd n.r.e.); University Interscholastic League v. Torres,\n616 S.W.2d 355, 357–58 (Tex.Civ.App—San Antonio 1981, no writ); Smith v. Hamby, 609 S.W.2d 866, 868 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Fort Worth 1980, no writ). Because the court of appeals' decision conflicts with the requirements of Rule 683, we grant the\napplication for writ of error. Pursuant to Rule 133(b), Tex.R.App.P., without hearing oral argument, we reverse the judgment\nof the court of appeals, declare the temporary injunction void and order that it be dissolved.\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thompson, Allison & Huerta, Steve T.\nHastings, Huerta Hastings & Allison, Corpus Christi, for Respondent.\n\nOpinion\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\nIn this negligence case, we decide whether the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the plaintiffs' human factors and\nsafety expert. The court of appeals held that it did. Honeycutt v. K-Mart, 1 S.W.3d 239 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1999). We\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the expert because none of his opinions would assist the\ntrier-of-fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact issue. We therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment and\nrender judgment that the Honeycutts take nothing from K–Mart.\n\nLisa Honeycutt injured her back while shopping at a K–Mart store in Portland, Texas. She was waiting in line to check out at\nthe register next to the cart corral when the injury occurred. The cart corral, where K–Mart stores empty shopping carts, usually\nconsists of two horizontal rails intersecting a series of vertical posts; however, a part of the upper rail was missing. While in\nline, Honeycutt sat on the lower rail where the top rail was missing with her back to the shopping carts.\n\nAs Honeycutt was sitting on the lower rail, Linda Robledo, a service desk supervisor and twelve-and-a-half-year employee,\npushed several shopping carts into the cart corral. Robledo saw Honeycutt quickly stand up. Robledo was unable to see\nHoneycutt because Honeycutt was hunched over with her elbows on her knees and Robledo's view was totally or partially\nobscured by the carts already in the corral.\n\nLisa and Michael Honeycutt sued K–Mart for injuries to Lisa's back allegedly caused from being hit by the shopping carts. The\nHoneycutts hired Dr. Way Johnston as a human factors and safety expert. During discovery, Johnston entered the K–Mart store\nwithout notifying K–Mart. In his report, Johnston offered the following five opinions: (i) the lack of a top rail presented an\nunreasonable risk of injury to shoppers and employees of K–Mart; (ii) the accident would not have occurred but for the lack of\na top rail; (iii) Linda Robledo was not properly trained in pushing shopping carts; (iv) Linda Robledo failed to keep a proper\nlookout while pushing the shopping carts into the cart corral; and, (v) Lisa Honeycutt was not contributorily negligent.\n\nBefore trial, K–Mart moved to exclude Johnston from testifying. K–Mart argued that Johnston did not satisfy the requirements\nof Texas Rule of Evidence 702 because his opinions were not relevant and reliable and were within the average juror's common\nknowledge. K–Mart also argued that the trial court should exclude Johnston's testimony because his unauthorized inspection of\nthe store violated former Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 167. The trial court denied the motion. During trial, K–Mart reasserted\nits motion, which the trial court granted without specifying *360 the grounds. The Honeycutts made a bill of exceptions.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                            3\n\fK-Mart Corp. v. Honeycutt, 24 S.W.3d 357 (2000)\n43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1002\n\n\nThe case was submitted to the jury under a general negligence theory against K–Mart and a comparative negligence theory\nagainst Lisa Honeycutt. The jury answered that both K–Mart and Honeycutt were negligent and attributed eighty-percent of the\nfault to Honeycutt. As a result, the trial court rendered a take-nothing judgment against the Honeycutts.\n\nThe Honeycutts appealed. The court of appeals initially affirmed the judgment. But on rehearing, it reversed the trial court\nand remanded the case for a new trial. 1 S.W.3d at 245. The court of appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in\nexcluding Johnston because he was qualified to testify and his testimony satisfied the relevance and reliability requirements of\nE.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549 (Tex.1995). 1 S.W.3d at 243–44. The court also held that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in excluding Johnston for violating former Rule 167 because the infraction was harmless. Id. at 245.\n\n [1] [2] [3] We review a trial court's exclusion of expert testimony for abuse of discretion. See Gammill v. Jack Williams\nChevrolet, 972 S.W.2d 713, 718–19 (Tex.1998). A trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling is arbitrary, unreasonable or\nwithout reference to any guiding rules or legal principles. See Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex.1998). Because the\ntrial court did not specify the ground on which it excluded Dr. Johnston's testimony, we will affirm the trial court's ruling if any\nground is meritorious. See Bradley v. State ex rel. White, 990 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex.1999).\n\nThe court of appeals did not consider all of the grounds K–Mart asserted for excluding Johnston under Texas Rule of Evidence\n702. Rule 702 states: “If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\nmay testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.” TEX.R. EVID. 702; see also Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 718. The\ncourt of appeals ruled only that Johnston's testimony was relevant and reliable. It failed to consider whether Johnston's opinions\nwere beyond the average juror's common knowledge.\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] That a witness has knowledge, skill, expertise, or training does not necessarily mean that the witness can\nassist the trier-of-fact. See Broders v. Heise, 924 S.W.2d 148, 153 (Tex.1996). Expert testimony assists the trier-of-fact when\nthe expert's knowledge and experience on a relevant issue are beyond that of the average juror and the testimony helps the\ntrier-of-fact understand the evidence or determine a fact issue. See $18,800 in U.S. Currency v. State, 961 S.W.2d 257, 265\n(Tex.App.-Houston [1 st Dist.] 1997, no writ); Glasscock v. Income Property Servs. Inc., 888 S.W.2d 176, 180 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1 st Dist.] 1994, writ dism'd by agr.). When the jury is equally competent to form an opinion about the ultimate\nfact issues or the expert's testimony is within the common knowledge of the jury, the trial court should exclude the expert's\ntestimony. Glasscock, 888 S.W.2d at 180. Thus, “Rule 702 makes inadmissible expert testimony as to a matter which obviously\nis within the common knowledge of jurors because such testimony, almost by definition, can be of no assistance.” Scott v.\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 789 F.2d 1052, 1055 (4 th Cir.1986).\n\n [8] We conclude that none of Johnston's five opinions would have been helpful to the jury in this case. Johnston's first and fifth\nopinions concern the ultimate issues of K–Mart and Honeycutt's negligence. Johnston asserts that the lack of a top railing created\nan unreasonable risk because it served as an invitation for people to sit on the lower railing. Johnston's training and experience\nas a human factors expert informed him that when human *361 beings encounter a low railing, they will sit there. This same\nreasoning compelled his conclusion that Honeycutt's sitting on the lower railing was not unreasonable conduct. The jury did not\nneed Johnston's assistance to determine whether the lack of a top railing was unreasonable. The jury viewed photographs of the\ncart corral from which it could draw its own conclusions. This case is similar to Scott, in which the Fourth Circuit held that it\nwas error to allow a human factors expert to testify that defects in a sidewalk curb created an unreasonably dangerous condition\nfor women wearing high heels. 789 F.2d at 1055. The Fourth Circuit concluded that it would have been of little help to the jury\nbecause the jurors were able to observe the accident scene for themselves and reach a conclusion about the dangerousness of the\ncondition. Id. In this case, the jury's collective common sense could ably assist it in determining whether people would likely\nsit on the lower railing. See id. (holding it was error to permit human factors expert to testify that women wearing high heels\ntend to avoid walking on grates); see also Persinger v. Norfolk & Western Ry., 920 F.2d 1185, 1188 (4 th Cir.1990) (excluding\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1002\n\nexpert testimony about whether the weight the plaintiff had to carry was unreasonable because the testimony “did no more than\nstate the obvious”); Stepney v. Dildy, 128 F.R.D. 77, 80 (D.Md.1989) (“Nor is the testimony of a human factors expert required\nto advise the jury that moisture will freeze at 32 degrees or colder.”); Richmond, Human Factors Experts in Personal Injury\nLitigation, 46 ARK. L.REV. 333, 337 (1993) (“[M]any experts misuse human factors expertise in litigation by either testifying\nabout matters clearly within the jury's common knowledge or offering opinions without adequate foundation.”).\n\n [9] [10] [11] Dr. Johnston's other opinions are also not helpful to the jury because they involve matters within the average\njuror's common knowledge. His second opinion is that the lack of a top railing caused Honeycutt's injuries. This is not a causation\nissue that requires a scientific or technical explanation. It was within the jury's ability to determine on its own whether the lack\nof a railing caused the accident. Johnston's third opinion is that Robledo did not receive proper training for pushing shopping\ncarts. The jurors in this case did not need assistance in determining whether Robledo knew how to properly push shopping\ncarts. An expert opinion on how to push a shopping cart would not have aided the jury in deciding the ultimate fact issues in\nthis case. His fourth opinion is that Robledo did not keep a proper lookout while pushing the carts into the corral. The jury did\nnot need any special interpretation of the facts for it to determine whether Robledo was negligent.\n\nThus, all of Johnston's conclusions would tell the jury how they should view the facts. The jury in this case was competent\nto determine the ultimate issues without Johnston's testimony. Therefore, the trial court was within its discretion to exclude\nthe testimony. 1\n\nPursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 59.1, without hearing oral argument, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment\nand render judgment that the Honeycutts take nothing from K–Mart.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n43 Tex.

The clerk has refused to forward the applications and record\non direct orders of the justices of the court of appeals.\n\nRelators Mapco, Inc., Mapco Underground Storage of Texas, Inc., and other aligned parties appealed the trial court judgment\nagainst them to the Ninth Court of Appeals. The case was argued June 15, 1989. At that time the three justices who heard the\ncase were Chief Justice Martin Dies and Justices Burgess and Brookshire. On August 31, 1989, Chief Justice Dies retired, and\non September 1, 1989, Chief Justice Ronald L. Walker assumed the bench as the appointed successor.\n\nOn November 16, 1989, the court of appeals issued its opinions and judgment. Justice Burgess wrote the “majority” opinion,\nwhich reversed the trial court judgment and remanded the cause; Justice Brookshire dissented. The written judgment of the\ncourt conforms to the “majority” opinion disposition. At the end of the court's opinions this notation appears: “Panel of Dies,\nC.J., Brookshire, J., Burgess, J. [Next Line:] Walker, C.J., not sitting.”\n\nOn November 30, 1989, the appellees (the “Carter parties”) filed their motion for rehearing. The final point of the motion for\nrehearing specifically alleged as error the improper court of appeals panel issue. Appellees argued that after his resignation\nChief Justice Dies was not authorized to participate in the decision, and that without his concurrence the decision was one-\nto-one, in violation of sections 22.216(i) and 22.222 of the Texas Government Code. 1 On December 7, 1989, the court of\nappeals overruled the motion for rehearing. There is no notation concerning which justices participated in the overruling of\nthe motion for rehearing.\n\nOn December 21, 1989, the appellees filed with the court of appeals clerk what they styled “Appellees Motion for\nReconsideration, or Alternatively, for Opinion.” This “motion” re-urged two points that had been in the motion for rehearing,\nparticularly the panel issue. It urged that the opinion and judgment on their face did not show concurrence of a majority of the\nonly “panel” that could have been sitting when the judgment was rendered, that the judgment was “void or voidable” for that\nreason, and that the court should at least issue a new opinion addressing the panel question.\n\nOn January 4, 1990, the court of appeals through its clerk issued a letter stating appellee's motion for reconsideration was\ngranted, directing re-briefing and setting the case for re-argument. On January 8, 1990, appellees filed their application for writ\nof error with the court of appeals clerk with a cover letter stating it was\n\n  to be filed * * * pursuant to Rule 130(b) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. This Application is submitted for filing\n  subject to the Order of the Court of Appeals dated January 4, 1990 granting Appellees' Motion for Reconsideration, *702\n  or Alternatively, For Opinion and ordering the subject Appeal to be reargued and rebriefed by the parties.\n\n  It is our position that the decision and judgment rendered by the Court on November 16, 1989 was void or voidable based\n  upon the lack of participation in the Judgment and Opinion rendered by a majority of the panel sitting on the Court at the time\n  of rendition of said Judgment and, therefore, did not commence the running of the time in which Appellees may file their\n  Application for Writ of Error.

Thereafter, the Mapco parties wrote the\ncourt of appeals clerk requesting that the applications and records be forwarded to the supreme court. The clerk responded with\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              3\n\fMapco, Inc. v. Forrest, 795 S.W.2d 700 (1990)\n\n\na letter stating that the court of appeals had “granted in full” the motion for reconsideration and that she declined to forward\nthe applications and record to the supreme court “following direct orders and instructions from the Justices of the Ninth Court\nof Appeals.” The Mapco parties then filed this mandamus proceeding.\n\n [1] [2] [3] Relators' argument is simply stated. The filing of the applications for writ of error deprived the court of appeals\nof jurisdiction to change its judgment. Ammex Warehouse Co. v. Archer, 381 S.W.2d 478, 482 (Tex.1964). As this court has\nstated, upon the filing of the application for writ of error “the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court immediately attached,” leaving\nthe court of appeals “without authority to make any order in the case.” Johnson v. Sovereign Camp, W.O.W., 125 Tex. 329,\n336, 83 S.W.2d 605, 608 (1935). 2 Relators also argue that the court of appeals' January 4, 1990 order cannot be justified as an\nexercise of its plenary power over its judgments, because its period of plenary power over its judgment expired on December\n31, 1989, when the term in which the judgment was rendered ended. 3 As this court has written, except for a “ministerial act”\nconsistent with the judgment, a court of appeals “is without authority to correct or alter a judgment after the expiration of the\nterm in which it was rendered.” Cockburn v. Hightower, 121 Tex. 555, 557, 52 S.W.2d 365, 366 (1932).\n\nIn reply the Carter parties urge a number of innovative arguments why the court of appeals could have jurisdiction to render\nits order. We address two of these, to clarify holdings of this court.\n\n [4] [5] [6] The Carter parties argue that the court of appeals' plenary jurisdiction to vacate its judgment continued into\nthe next term because the motion for reconsideration was “pending” when the term ended December 31, 1989. The appellate\nrules authorize a second or subsequent motion for rehearing only if the court of appeals modifies its judgment or opinion in\nconnection with the overruling of a previous motion. Tex.R.App.P. 100(d). A second motion for rehearing not authorized by\nthe rules is a nullity even if the court of appeals rules on it. Honeycutt v. Doss, 410 S.W.2d 772 (Tex.1966). Necessarily such\na motion did not extend the court of appeals' plenary jurisdiction over the judgment in the case.\n\nThe second argument is that the court of appeals' judgment was “void” because it was contrary to section 22.222(c) of the\nGovernment Code. In fact a corresponding provision appears in the constitution:\n\n   *703 The Court of Appeals may sit in sections as authorized by law. The concurrence of a majority of the judges sitting\n  in a section is necessary to decide a case.\n\n  Tex. Const. art. V, § 6.\n\nIt is also true that in Freeman v. Freeman, 160 Tex. 148, 156, 327 S.W.2d 428, 433 (1959), this court stated, “Judgments are\nvoid for lack of power in courts to render them when they are rendered contrary to constitutional or valid statutory prohibition\nor outside limiting constitutional or statutory authority.” Given only this language from Freeman, the Carter parties' argument\nis reasonably plausible that the court of appeals judgment was “void” as contrary to the “statutory prohibition” that a majority of\na panel must concur to render a decision, or beyond the authority of the court because the constitution requires the concurrence\nof a majority of a “section” of the court of appeals.\n\n [7] [8] In fact, the argument does not withstand closer scrutiny. We have spent considerable effort distinguishing and\nexplaining the quoted language from Freeman in holdings that a court's action contrary to a statute or statutory equivalent means\nthe action is erroneous or “voidable,” not that the ordinary appellate or other direct procedures to correct it may be circumvented.\nFor example, in El Paso Pipe and Supply Co. v. Mountain States Leasing, Inc., 617 S.W.2d 189 (Tex.1981), we expressly\ndistinguished Freeman and held that conflict with then rule 329b, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, although a mandatory rule\ndealing with the trial court's plenary power, did not make the judgment “void”; the error had to be corrected through the ordinary\nappellate process or other proper proceedings. Again, in Middleton v. Murff, 689 S.W.2d 212, 213 (Tex.1985), we expressly\ndisapproved the quoted statement from Freeman to the extent it was construed to mean that “[i]f a judgment rendered by a trial\ncourt is void it may be set aside by that court at any time.” We further explained it was only a trial court judgment rendered\nwithout “jurisdictional power” in the sense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction that could be set aside by the trial court at\nany time.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Murff failed to make it clear, we now expressly disapprove the quoted language from Freeman to\nthe extent it is construed to apply to a court of appeals' plenary power. Absent one of those rare circumstances that makes the\njudgment “void,” the mere fact that an action by a court of appeals is contrary to a statute, constitutional provision or rule of civil\nor appellate procedure makes it “voidable” or erroneous. A judgment is void only when it is apparent that the court rendering\nthe judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties, no jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the judgment, or\nno capacity to act as a court. Cook v. Cameron, 733 S.W.2d 137, 140 (Tex.1987); Browning v. Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362, 362\n(Tex.1985). On facts substantially similar to the present case, this court in an ordinary appeal recently held the court of appeals'\njudgment was erroneous, and reversed and remanded the cause. See Hayden v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 786 S.W.2d 260\n(Tex.1990). Despite its error, here the court of appeals had lost jurisdiction to correct it.\n\nBecause the orders and actions of the court of appeals and its clerk conflict with this court's decisions in Johnson v. Sovereign\nCamp, W.O.W. and Cockburn v. Hightower, and further with rule 132(a), Tex.R.App.P., we grant leave to file and without oral\nargument a majority of the court conditionally issues the writ of mandamus. Tex.R.App.P. 122. We direct the Ninth Court of\nAppeals and its clerk to forward the record and applications for writ of error to this court.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Tex.Gov't Code Ann. § 22.216(i) merely provides that the Ninth Court of Appeals consists of a chief justice and two other justices.\n        Tex.Gov't Code Ann. § 22.222 (1988) provides:\n           § 22.222.

PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014(4) (Vernon Supp.2000) (authorizing interlocutory appeal\nfrom an order granting a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction). In five issues, appellants contend generally that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by dissolving the temporary injunction because: (1) the trial court did not conduct an evidentiary\nhearing; (2) appellee failed to prove a change in circumstances; (3) the trial court refused to consider the evidence adduced at\nthe hearing on the motion to grant the temporary injunction when considering appellee's motion for summary judgment; (4)\nthe trial court erred by striking appellants' summary judgment proof; and (5) the dissolution was based on *876 an improper\nsummary judgment. We reverse the trial court's order dissolving the temporary injunction and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                            Factual and Procedural Background\n\nThe underlying lawsuit involves a 1982 lease-purchase agreement between appellants and appellee. Under the terms of the\nagreement, appellants leased appellee's house for one year and were to purchase the home for $240,000 on or before expiration\nof the lease. The agreement provided that when appellants purchased the home, seventy-five percent of the rental payments\nwould be applied to reduce the purchase price. Appellants, however, were unable to obtain financing, and at the end of the\none-year lease, the parties executed an addendum to the contract. The addendum provided that the closing date for purchase\nwas to be changed from on or before March 31, 1984 to on or before January 15, 1985. The addendum also provided that after\nMarch 31, 1984, the rental payments would no longer be applied to either the down payment or taken off of the purchase price.\nAgain, appellants were unable to close on the house, and in January 1985, appellee agreed, by letter, to extend the agreement for\nanother year. The letter provided that except for the closing date, “all other terms and conditions of the original lease-purchase\nagreement will remain the same.” Thereafter, until 1998, appellee agreed each year to extend the closing date. In 1998, appellee\nrefused to extend the closing date, notified appellants that the lease-purchase agreement had expired, and offered to sell the\nproperty to appellants for the original purchase price of $240,000.\n\nAppellants acknowledged that the agreement had expired. However, they offered to purchase the home for $65,975.06.\nAccording to appellants, the 1984 addendum to the original agreement only applied for that year, and when appellee agreed to\nextend the agreement in 1985 and thereafter, the original terms of the lease-purchase agreement were in effect. Thus, according\nto appellants, seventy-five percent of the rental payments from 1985 through 1998 should be applied to reduce the purchase\nprice of the home.\n\nWhen appellee disagreed, appellants sued him for breach of contract, specific performance, declaratory judgment, statutory\nand common law fraud, and attorneys' fees. At the same time, appellants requested a temporary injunction allowing them to\nremain in the house while the suit progressed. Appellee counterclaimed, alleging, among other things, that appellants breached\nthe contract and owed him for unpaid rentals. Appellee also brought suit for trespass to try title and an action to quiet title.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

McDaniel, 20 S.W.3d 873 (2000)\n\n\nOn September 1, 1998, after an evidentiary hearing, the trial court found that appellants made a prima facie showing of a\nprobable right and probable injury if a temporary injunction was not issued during pendency of the suit. The trial court also\nfound appellants would suffer immediate and irreparable harm. Therefore, the trial court granted appellants' application for\na temporary injunction enjoining appellee from selling the property or any act attempting to dispossess appellants from the\nproperty. The parties did not appeal the order granting the temporary injunction.\n\n [1] [2] Subsequently, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw on all of appellants' claims. Although appellee did not file a separate motion to dissolve the temporary injunction, the motion\nfor summary judgment contained a section arguing that “to the extent [the trial court] rules favorably on [appellee]'s motion\nfor summary judgment, [appellee] is entitled to dissolution of the [temporary] injunction.” Appellee did not seek summary\njudgment on his counterclaims. *877 1 After considering the evidence in support of the summary judgment, but without an\nevidentiary hearing on the motion to dissolve the temporary injunction, the trial court ordered that “[appellants] take nothing as\nto their claims of [appellee]” and further ordered the temporary injunction dissolved. This interlocutory appeal from the portion\nof the trial court's order dissolving the temporary injunction followed.\n\n\n\n                                                           Discussion\n\n [3] [4] When, as here, the interlocutory appeal is from an order granting a motion to dissolve, and the initial order granting\ntemporary injunctive relief was not appealed, we do not consider the propriety of the trial court's decision granting the initial\ninjunctive relief. See Tober v. Turner of Tex., Inc., 668 S.W.2d 831, 834 (Tex.App.-Austin 1984, no writ). Rather, we presume\nthe injunction was not improvidently granted and the record as a whole supports the trial court's action in granting the temporary\ninjunction. Id. We will not, therefore, review the reporter's record from the hearing on the motion to grant to ascertain if the\nevidence supports such grant. Id. at 835. Our review of the trial court's order of dissolution is limited to the narrow question\nof whether the trial court's action in dissolving the injunction constituted a clear abuse of discretion. Desai v. Reliance Mach.\nWorks, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.App.-Houston [14 th Dist.] 1991, no writ).\n\n [5] [6] The purpose of a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction is to provide a means to show that changed circumstances,\nincluding changes in the law, compel the dissolution of the injunction. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 836. The purpose is not to\ngive an unsuccessful party an opportunity to relitigate the propriety of the original grant. Id. When, as in this case, changed\ncircumstances are the basis of a motion to dissolve, the moving party must show some substantial change has occurred since\nthe proper issuance of the temporary injunction such that the order should be dissolved. See Desai, 813 S.W.2d at 642; Tober,\n668 S.W.2d at 836.\n\n [7] [8] [9] [10] Because of the narrow scope of review in this interlocutory appeal, we begin our analysis by determining\nwhich of appellants' issues are properly before us. The only legitimate purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the\nstatus quo pending trial, and the most expeditious relief from an unfavorable preliminary order dissolving an injunction is a\nprompt trial on the merits. See Reeder v. Intercontinental Plastics Mfg. Co., 581 S.W.2d 497, 499 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1979,\nno writ) (appeal from order granting temporary injunction). An interlocutory appeal should not be used to obtain an advance\nruling on the issues, and we may not give full consideration to the merits of the underlying lawsuit. See State v. Ruiz Wholesale\nCo., 901 S.W.2d 772, 777 (Tex.App.-Austin 1995, no writ) (discussing limited scope of review following denial of a temporary\ninjunction); Reeder, 581 S.W.2d at 499. Consideration of appellants' issues three, four, and five would require us to determine\nthe propriety of the summary judgment evidence and whether the trial court properly granted appellee's motion for summary\njudgment. We decline to do so without allowing the trial court an opportunity to render a final judgment. Because our jurisdiction\nto review interlocutory rulings is extremely narrow in scope, we must strictly limit our review of any interlocutory ruling over\nwhich we are granted jurisdiction. See *878 America Online, Inc. v. Williams, 958 S.W.2d 268, 271 (Tex.App.-Houston [14\nth\n   Dist.] 1997, no writ) (The legislature determines, by statute, whether a particular type of pretrial ruling may be appealable\nbefore a final judgment is rendered. We strictly construe those statutes authorizing interlocutory appeals.). Thus, we conclude\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

McDaniel, 20 S.W.3d 873 (2000)\n\n\nappellants' third, fourth, and fifth issues are not a proper basis upon which appellants may contend that the trial court abused\nits discretion by granting appellee's motion to dissolve. We dismiss appellants' third, fourth, and fifth issues.\n\nIn appellants' first and second issues, appellants contend the trial court abused its discretion by granting appellee's motion to\ndissolve because the trial court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing and appellee failed to prove a change in circumstances. 2\nIn essence, appellants argue that the trial court's interlocutory summary judgment alone is not a proper basis to support the\ntrial court's discretion in dissolving the temporary injunction. The parties agree, and the record supports, that the trial court\ngranted appellee's motion to dissolve the temporary injunction solely on the basis of its ruling on appellee's motion for summary\njudgment. We must decide, therefore, whether the trial court's interlocutory summary judgment is a change in circumstances\nthat would support the dissolution of the temporary injunction.\n\n [11] [12] [13] [14] The trial court unquestionably has the authority to dissolve a temporary injunction upon a showing of\nchanged circumstances. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 834. In our view, a “change in circumstances” refers to a change in conditions\noccurring since the granting of the temporary injunction. Changed circumstances may include an agreement of the parties,\nnewly revealed facts, or a change in the law that make the temporary injunction unnecessary or improper. Cf. Desai, 813 S.W.2d\nat 641–42 (dissolution of temporary injunction where appellees showed they had been effectively excluded from participation\nin operation and management of company); see also City of Tyler v. St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co., 405 S.W.2d 330, 333 (Tex.1966)\n(only trial court has jurisdiction to modify or vacate permanent injunction based on “changed conditions” because trial court can\nsubpoena witnesses, take evidence, and make findings of fact). Here, the “change in circumstances” alleged in appellee's motion\nwas not newly revealed facts or a change in the law; rather, the “change” was merely an interlocutory judicial determination\nof the merits of appellants' claims against appellee. The trial court's summary judgment did not reach appellee's claims against\nappellants and the trial court did not order any severance of the parties' claims. We conclude the trial court's interlocutory\nruling on the merits of appellants' claims is not, in and of itself, a “change in circumstances” authorizing dissolution of the\ntrial court's otherwise properly granted temporary injunction. 3 Given this conclusion, we still *879 must determine whether\nthe trial court, after it properly granted the temporary injunction, could have dissolved it absent any changed circumstances.\nWe conclude it could not.\n\nWe recognize that in Tober, the Austin court of appeals, relying on City of Hudson v. Ivie, 592 S.W.2d 658 (Tex.Civ.App.-\nBeaumont 1979, no writ), stated that a trial court has the authority to reverse its prior temporary injunction order absent a\nshowing of changed circumstances. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835. The procedural posture of this case, however, is different from\nIvie. In Ivie, the trial court granted a temporary injunction after an evidentiary hearing. Five days later, after a non-evidentiary\nhearing, the trial court granted the defendant's motion to dissolve the injunction. On the same day, the trial court dismissed\nthe entire proceeding. The court of appeals determined that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the case after\nholding only a preliminary hearing. However, it affirmed the trial court's order dissolving the injunction because it “read the\nstatement of facts containing the evidence offered at the [temporary injunction] hearing and [could] not conclude that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in dissolving the temporary injunction which had been improvidently granted a few days earlier.”\nIvie, 592 S.W.2d at 659–60.\n\nIn Ivie, unlike in this case where the time to review the order granting the temporary injunction has expired, the court of appeals\nhad jurisdiction to review the propriety of the trial court's decision to grant the temporary injunction. The court of appeals'\ndetermination that the trial court had the authority to dissolve its previously granted temporary injunction was, in reality, a\ndetermination that the temporary injunction had been improperly granted. Such is not the case here. We do not have jurisdiction\nto consider the propriety of the trial court's decision to grant the temporary injunction. Rather, we must presume the trial court's\ninitial decision to grant the temporary injunction was proper. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 834. Because we must recognize the\ntrial court properly granted the temporary injunction, we conclude that, absent changed circumstances, the temporary injunction\nshould remain in effect until a final disposition of the parties' claims.\n\n [15] Our conclusion is directly supported by the very nature of this appeal. The sole basis for granting appellee's motion\nto dissolve the temporary injunction was the trial court's interlocutory ruling on the merits of appellants' claims. Yet, we are\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              6\n\fMurphy v. McDaniel, 20 S.W.3d 873 (2000)\n\n\nprecluded from reviewing the summary judgment at this time. If we were to conclude that the trial court's interlocutory summary\njudgment is, in and of itself, an appropriate basis for the trial court's dissolution of its otherwise properly granted temporary\ninjunction, appellants could obtain a meaningful, interlocutory review of the dissolution order only through our review of\nthe merits of the interlocutory summary judgment, which we clearly cannot do. We are of the opinion that, absent changed\ncircumstances, a determination of the parties' claims should serve as the basis for dissolution of a temporary injunction only\nupon final adjudication. At that time, the temporary injunction becomes moot. See Isuani v. Manske–Sheffield Radiology Group,\nP.A., 802 S.W.2d 235, 236 (Tex.1991); Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 973 S.W.2d 378, 384\n(Tex.App.-Austin 1998, no writ).\n\nBecause the trial court's sole basis for granting appellee's motion to dissolve was its interlocutory judgment, we conclude the\ntrial court abused its discretion by granting appellee's motion to dissolve. The trial court's decision to dissolve was not based on a\nconclusion that the temporary injunction was improvidently granted or on the guiding principle of a change in circumstances. 4\nWe sustain appellants' first and second issues.\n\n\n *880 We reverse that portion of the trial court's judgment dissolving the temporary injunction and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Thus, we agree with the parties that the summary judgment is interlocutory and not a final adjudication of the merits of this lawsuit.\n        When a summary judgment does not dispose of all parties and issues and does not purport to be final or contain controlling “Mother\n        Hubbard” language, it is an interlocutory summary judgment that cannot be appealed except in limited circumstances set out by\n        statute. See Mafrige v. Ross, 866 S.W.2d 590, 592 (Tex.1993).\n2       In their brief, appellants argue issues one and two together. We will address them likewise.\n3       In this appeal, the only evidence the trial court could have considered in making its determination to dissolve the temporary injunction\n        was the evidence offered in support of appellee's motion for summary judgment. As we have previously concluded, our limited review\n        of the dissolution of the temporary injunction does not allow us to consider the propriety of the evidence offered in support of the\n        motion for summary judgment. We note, however, that a litigant could conceivably rely on the same evidence presented in a separate\n        evidentiary hearing to support a motion to dissolve. In that situation, the trial court could, if necessary, make factual determinations,\n        and would not be bound by the procedural restrictions of a summary judgment proceeding. Cf. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. v. Hayden, 805\n        S.W.2d 932, 935 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 1991, no writ) (trial court should conduct separate hearings when faced with “overlapping\n        and intermingling” motions concerning summary judgment and other matters that allow oral testimony). That, however, is not the\n        case here. In this case, the trial court did not conduct a separate hearing on the motion to dissolve.\n4       We also note that the trial court's decision was not based on principles of fundamental error or on any statutory authorization.\n\n\n End of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

After the LaFrances sued Padilla, his insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,\nassumed *456 defense of the claims. The parties subsequently engaged in settlement negotiations and, as discussed below,\nvigorously dispute whether an enforceable settlement agreement was consummated.\n\nOn April 10, 1991, Jeffrey Steidley, the LaFrances' attorney, mailed a settlement demand to Brian Chandler, Padilla's attorney,\nproviding in pertinent part as follows:\n\n  Dear Mr. Chandler:\n\n  You are quite familiar with the facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced matter. At this time we make\n  demand for policy limits of $40,000.00 for full and final settlement of this case against the insured that you represent. Payment\n  of this sum should be made on or before Tuesday, April 23, 1991 at 5:00 p.m., by delivery of checks in the appropriate\n  amount to the offices of the undersigned made payable in the following amounts and to the following payees:\n\n     One check in the amount of $20,000.00 to Madeleine LaFrance As Next Friend of Michelle LaFrance and Olivier &\n     Steidley.\n\n     One check in the amount of $20,000.00 made payable to Ernest J.

Carry responded that she would have Steidley\ncall Bradshaw to discuss the lien.

Each time he was able to speak only with Carry, who informed Bradshaw\nthat the lien had not yet been resolved.\n\nWhen Bradshaw still had not heard from Steidley by the afternoon of April 23, the settlement deadline, he faxed this handwritten\nletter to Steidley:\n\n  Dear Mr. Steidley,\n\n  This will confirm our settlement agreement of 4/18/91, whereby State Farm agreed to meet the policy limit demands set out\n  in your letter of 4/10/91. The only thing holding up resolution of this is the hospital lien re: Michelle. I await word from you\n  regarding the lien so I know to whom to make drafts payable.\n\nIt is unclear from the record what Bradshaw was referring to by the “agreement of 4/18/91.” Steidley responded before 5:00\np.m. the same day, by fax and regular mail, with this letter:\n\n  Dear Mr. Bradshaw:\n\n  This letter will confirm that the above referenced matter has been settled for all applicable policy limits, which have been\n  represented to us to be $40,000.00. Please forward settlement checks in the above referenced matter. This office will agreed\n  [sic] to take care of the lien filed by Medical Center Hospital out of the settlement funds forwarded by your office.\n\n  Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.\n\nBradshaw did not see Steidley's response until he arrived at his office the next morning, April 24. Approximately one week\nlater, Chandler tendered two settlement checks for $20,000 each to Steidley, along with a formal settlement agreement. Steidley,\nhowever, refused to accept the checks or sign the agreement, contending that Padilla had not *457 timely accepted the April\n10 settlement offer. 2\n\nPadilla subsequently filed Steidley's April 23 letter with the court, describing it as “an acceptance of a settlement.” Padilla then\nfiled a counterclaim in the pending suit, seeking enforcement of the alleged settlement agreement, and both sides moved for\nsummary judgment on the counterclaim. Padilla argued that the letters between the parties' representatives constituted a written\nsettlement agreement. Although acknowledging that the court could not render a consent judgment incorporating the terms of\nthe settlement, as the LaFrances had revoked consent, he nonetheless contended that the court could enforce the settlement\nby summary judgment. The LaFrances countered that the parties did not have an enforceable agreement under Texas Rule of\nCivil Procedure 11, which requires agreements regarding pending suits to “be in writing, signed and filed with the papers as\npart of the record....” The LaFrances further argued that, even if an otherwise valid Rule 11 agreement existed, it could not\nbe enforced since the LaFrances had revoked consent prior to any judgment being rendered on the agreement. The LaFrances\nalso moved to sever the counterclaim.\n\nAfter a hearing on May 1, 1992, the court orally ruled that an enforceable settlement agreement did not exist, granting the\nLaFrances' motion for summary judgment and denying Padilla's. The court also granted the motion for severance, noting on\nthe docket that a final judgment would be granted to the LaFrances on the counterclaim. The court, however, did not sign a\nwritten judgment or order of severance at that time.\n\nOn June 11, 1992, Padilla filed a “Motion for Reconsideration on his Motion for Summary Judgment,” raising the same\narguments contained in his original motion for summary judgment and adding one additional argument. 3 Although this motion\nwas apparently set for oral hearing on June 22, 4 there is no indication in the record or the briefs that any hearing occurred.\nOn June 19, Padilla filed another motion, styled simply as a “Motion for Summary Judgment,” setting forth essentially the\nsame arguments contained in the motion for reconsideration. No oral hearing was held on this subsequent motion for summary\njudgment, and neither it nor the motion for reconsideration was submitted for a ruling on Harris County's submission docket.

Sup. Ct. J. 663\n\nLocal Rule 3.3.2 of the Harris County District Courts. On October 19, 1992, the court signed an order granting the LaFrances'\nmotion for summary judgment and denying Padilla's. This order referred only to the cross motions for summary judgment argued\non May 1, mentioning neither Padilla's motion for reconsideration nor his later successive motion for summary judgment. 5\nOn November 20, 1992, the court signed an order severing Padilla's counterclaim and assigning it a new cause number, thus\nfinalizing the earlier summary judgment.\n\nPadilla appealed from this severed cause. The LaFrances moved the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal, contending that the\ntranscript, which Padilla filed 82 days after the judgment became final on November 20, 1992, was untimely. Under Texas Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 54(a), the transcript must be filed within sixty days after judgment, or within 120 days if a timely motion\n *458 for new trial or motion to modify the judgment has been filed. The court of appeals originally dismissed the appeal, but\nreinstated it on rehearing. The court concluded that Padilla's motion for rehearing of the trial court's oral summary judgment\nruling was the equivalent of a motion for new trial, extending the appellate deadlines under Rule 54(a). 875 S.W.2d at 732.\n\nAs to the merits, the court of appeals concluded that the parties did not have an enforceable settlement agreement under Texas\nRule of Civil Procedure 11. The court held that, under Rule 11, consent to the settlement agreement must exist at the time it is\nfiled with the court. 875 S.W.2d at 734. Although not expressly deciding whether Steidley's April 23 letter constituted a signed\nwriting sufficient under Rule 11, the court noted that the LaFrances had revoked any consent prior to that letter being filed with\nthe court. Id. The court accordingly affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of the LaFrances.\n\n\n\n                                                                 II\n\n[1]   We initially address the LaFrances' jurisdictional argument. They contend by cross-point that the court of appeals should\nhave dismissed the appeal because Padilla failed to timely file the transcript. 6 We disagree.\n\nAn appellant must file the transcript in the court of appeals “within sixty days after the judgment is signed, or, if a timely motion\nfor new trial or to modify the judgment has been filed by any party, ... within one hundred twenty days after the judgment\nis signed.” Tex.R.App.P. 54(a). Padilla filed the transcript 82 days after the judgment became final and appealable through\nseverance. 7 The issue, therefore, is whether Padilla timely filed a motion for new trial or a motion to modify the judgment.\n\nA motion for new trial “shall be filed prior to or within thirty days after the judgment or other order complained of is signed.”\nTex.R.Civ.P. 329b(a). A motion to modify the judgment must be filed within this same time period. Tex.R.Civ.P. 329b(g).\nMoreover, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 306c directs that a motion for new trial filed before judgment “shall be deemed to have\nbeen filed on the date of but subsequent to the time of signing of the judgment the motion assails....” We conclude that, under\nthe authority of these rules, Padilla's June 11 motion for reconsideration was the equivalent of a motion to modify the judgment,\nextending the appellate deadlines. These rules prevent the procedural trap that otherwise could occur if a party prematurely\nfiled a motion that was intended to assail the final judgment. See, e.g., Syn–Labs, Inc. v. Franz, 778 S.W.2d 202, 205 (Tex.App.\n—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ); Miller v. Hernandez, 708 S.W.2d 25, 27 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1986, no writ). Cf. Fredonia\nState Bank v. General American Life Ins. Co., 881 S.W.2d 279, 280–82 (Tex.1994) (motion for new trial filed after original\njudgment, but before amended judgment, was sufficient to preserve factual insufficiency points).\n\nAt the time Padilla moved for reconsideration, the trial court had orally rendered summary judgment for the LaFrances on\nthe counterclaim and had orally ordered that the counterclaim be severed, indicating to the parties at the May 1 hearing that a\nfinal *459 judgment would be signed on Padilla's counterclaim. Although Padilla's motion for reconsideration was premature,\nit clearly assailed the court's final judgment. It thus qualifies as a premature motion to modify the judgment, extending the\nappellate timetable.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 663\n\nThe LaFrances argue that Padilla's motion for reconsideration was of no effect because it was superseded by his subsequent\n“motion for summary judgment” filed eight days later. The LaFrances rely on State v. Seventeen Thousand Dollars, 809 S.W.2d\n637 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1991, no writ), where the court, in deciding whether the appellee had preserved a particular\nsummary judgment ground in the trial court, held that “[a] substituted or amended motion for summary judgment supercedes\nand supplants the previous motion, which may no longer be considered.” 809 S.W.2d at 639 (citing Tex.R.Civ.P. 65). Even\nif this holding is correct, an issue we do not decide, it does not support the LaFrances' position here. To fall within this rule,\nPadilla's June 19 motion for summary judgment would have to be considered an amended or substituted version of his motion\nfor reconsideration. However, the June 19 summary judgment motion was not styled as an amended motion to reconsider, and\nit did not directly assail the trial court's earlier ruling, as did the motion for reconsideration. Further, if the later motion for\nsummary judgment was actually an amendment to the motion for reconsideration, as the LaFrances seem to argue, it likewise\nwould operate to extend the appellate timetable. Although we do not decide whether the later motion for summary judgment,\nfiled after the trial court's oral rendition of judgment, in and of itself extended the appellate timetable, under the circumstances\nof this case this filing cannot negate the effect of the earlier motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe LaFrances also point out that Padilla's motion for reconsideration was filed under the original, rather than the severed, cause\nnumber. They note that the trial court's later written severance order designated certain documents to be included in the record\nof the severed counterclaim, but did not include the motion for reconsideration, and Padilla never requested that the severance\norder be supplemented or modified. Because the motion for reconsideration was never actually filed under the severed cause\nnumber, the LaFrances contend that it cannot be considered in this appeal from the severed cause.\n\nThis argument is without merit. At the time Padilla filed the motion for reconsideration, there was no severed cause number, as\nthe trial court had not yet signed a written order of severance. Further, the trial court's order granting summary judgment, which\nis the order Padilla's motion for reconsideration assailed, was also filed under the original cause number, as it likewise preceded\nthe order of severance. After the trial court subsequently signed the order of severance, finalizing the summary judgment,\nPadilla filed a request for transcript under the severed cause number requesting that numerous pleadings, including his motion\nfor reconsideration, be included in the appellate transcript. The transcript before us from the severed cause accordingly includes\nthe motion for reconsideration. Under these circumstances, the motion for reconsideration operated to extend the appellate\ntimetable in the severed cause. See McRoberts v. Ryals, 863 S.W.2d 450, 454–55 (Tex.1993); Mueller v. Saravia, 826 S.W.2d\n608, 609 (Tex.1992).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that Padilla timely filed the transcript. The court of appeals thus did not err in refusing to\ndismiss Padilla's appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                                III\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 provides as follows:\n\n             Unless otherwise provided in these rules, no agreement between attorneys or parties touching any suit\n             pending will be enforced unless it be in writing, signed and filed with the papers as part of the record,\n             or unless it be made in open court and entered of record.\n\nThis rule has existed since 1840 and has contained the filing requirement since 1877. See Kennedy v. Hyde, 682 S.W.2d 525,\n526 (Tex.1984) (tracing the history of Rule 11). The rationale for the rule is straightforward:\n\n              *460 Agreements of counsel, respecting the disposition of causes, which are merely verbal, are very\n             liable to be misconstrued or forgotten, and to beget misunderstandings and controversies; and hence there\n             is great propriety in the rule which requires that all agreements of counsel respecting their causes shall\n             be in writing, and if not, the court will not enforce them. They will then speak for themselves, and the\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              6\n\fPadilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (1995)\n38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 663\n\n             court can judge of their import, and proceed to act upon them with safety. The rule is a salutary one, and\n             ought to be adhered to whenever counsel disagree as to what has transpired between them.\n\nBirdwell v. Cox, 18 Tex. 535, 537 (1857). A settlement agreement must comply with Rule 11 to be enforceable. Kennedy, 682\nS.W.2d at 528. 8\n\nThe LaFrances argue that 1) the writings in this case do not evidence a binding agreement, 2) even if there was an agreement,\nit did not comply with Rule 11 because the LaFrances withdrew their consent before the writings were filed with the court, and\n3) any agreement was further unenforceable because the LaFrances withdrew their consent before judgment was rendered on\nthe agreement. We consider each of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n\n                                                                   A\n\n [2] [3] Rule 11 requires settlement agreements to “be in writing.” Although we have never articulated what is necessary\nto satisfy this “in writing” requirement, we may analogize to the statute of frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in\nwriting. See Tex.Bus. & Com.Code § 26.01. To satisfy the statute of frauds, “there must be a written memorandum which is\ncomplete within itself in every material detail, and which contains all of the essential elements of the agreement, so that the\ncontract can be ascertained from the writings without resorting to oral testimony.” Cohen v. McCutchin, 565 S.W.2d 230, 232\n(Tex.1978). The written memorandum, however, need not be contained in one document. See Adams v. Abbott, 151 Tex. 601,\n254 S.W.2d 78, 80 (1952).\n\n [4] [5] [6] These principles apply equally to Rule 11 agreements. Applying them here, we hold that the series of letters\nbetween Steidley, Bradshaw and Chandler are sufficient to constitute an agreement in writing satisfying Rule 11. Steidley's\ninitial letter to Chandler offered to settle the case for the $40,000 policy limits, making clear that the offer could only be accepted\nby payment of the money by a specific deadline. It is undisputed that Padilla did not tender the $40,000 within that deadline.\nWhere an offer prescribes the time and manner of acceptance, those terms must ordinarily be complied with to create a contract.\nSee Town of Lindsay v. Cooke County Elec. Cooperative Ass'n, 502 S.W.2d 117, 118 (Tex.1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 970,\n94 S.Ct. 1993, 40 L.Ed.2d 559 (1974). However, a different method of acceptance may be effectual where the “original offeror\nthereafter manifests his assent to the other party.” Id. That was the case here. The later writings reflect that Steidley agreed to\na modification of the terms of acceptance set out in the original letter.\n\nBradshaw's letter—faxed to Steidley on the afternoon of April 23—agreed to pay the $40,000 policy limits, specifically\nconfirming a “settlement agreement” between the parties. That letter, however, noted uncertainty as to one detail, payment\nof the hospital lien, and requested guidance from Steidley. Steidley responded that same day with a letter indicating that\nplaintiffs would pay the hospital lien out of the settlement funds, specifically stating that “[t]his letter will confirm that the above\nreferenced matter has been settled for all applicable policy limits....” (emphasis added). Steidley used this language, indicating\na consummated settlement, notwithstanding that no checks had not yet been forwarded by Padilla. Steidley, therefore, assented\nto Padilla's alteration of the mode of acceptance set out in Steidley's original offer. Rather than requiring actual payment by a\nparticular deadline, Steidley accepted Padilla's agreement to pay the policy limits as acceptance of his earlier offer. Moreover,\n *461 the letters reflect all material terms of the agreement; i.e., Padilla agreed to pay $40,000 in settlement of all claims,\nand the LaFrances agreed to be pay the hospital lien out of those proceeds. We accordingly hold that the parties entered into a\nbinding settlement agreement, evidenced by a writing sufficient to satisfy Rule 11. 9\n\n\n\n                                                                   B\n\n [7] Rule 11 requires settlement agreements to be filed “with the papers as part of the record.” Padilla did not file any of\nthe settlement letters until after the LaFrances had refused to accept the settlement checks tendered by Padilla. The court of\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                  7\n\fPadilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (1995)\n38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 663\n\nappeals accordingly held that the agreement did not comply with Rule 11 because it was not filed until after the LaFrances\nhad revoked their consent.\n\nAlthough Rule 11 requires the writing to be filed in the court record, it does not say when it must be filed. The purpose of\nthe rule—to avoid disputes over the terms of oral settlement agreements—is not furthered by requiring the writing to be filed\nbefore consent is withdrawn. As noted by the dissent below, “[t]o require the parties to immediately rush to the courthouse with\na signed document in order to quickly comply with the requirements of Rule 11 before the other party reneges on his agreement\ngoes against the grain of the policy in Texas jurisprudence which favors the settlement of lawsuits.” 875 S.W.2d at 735. The\npurpose of the filing requirement, in the language of Birdwell v. Cox, is to put the agreement before the court so that “the court\ncan judge of [its] import, and proceed to act upon [it] with safety.” 18 Tex. at 537. This purpose is satisfied so long as the\nagreement is filed before it is sought to be enforced. Padilla met that requirement here by filing each of the settlement letters\nwith his motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim.\n\n\n\n                                                                 C\n\nFinally, the LaFrances argue that the settlement is unenforceable because they withdrew consent before judgment was rendered\non the agreement. The LaFrances rely on Kennedy v. Hyde, where we held that “notwithstanding a valid Rule 11 agreement,\nconsent must exist at the time an agreed judgment is rendered.” 682 S.W.2d at 528. See also Burnaman v. Heaton, 150 Tex.\n333, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (1951).\n\n [8] The LaFrances, however, confuse the requirements for an agreed judgment with those for an enforceable settlement\nagreement. Although a court cannot render a valid agreed judgment absent consent at the time it is rendered, this does not\npreclude the court, after proper notice and hearing, from enforcing a settlement agreement complying with Rule 11 even though\none side no longer consents to the settlement. The judgment in the latter case is not an agreed judgment, but rather is a judgment\nenforcing a binding contract.\n\nIn Burnaman, for example, the plaintiff wanted to repudiate a settlement that her attorney had agreed to on the record in open\ncourt, claiming that she had not authorized such settlement. Although aware of the plaintiff's objection, the court subsequently\nrendered a consent judgment incorporating the terms of the settlement. We held that the consent judgment was improper since\ncontemporaneous consent was lacking. “It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto may at one\ntime have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the\ncourt.” *462 240 S.W.2d at 291. In reversing the agreed judgment, however, we noted as follows:\n\n            Since the judgment of the trial court is reversed, we cannot pass on the effect of the agreement made by\n            the attorneys or the notation of that agreement on the docket. We can only say that the announcement\n            of the agreement in open court and its notation on the docket cannot give it the force of a judgment. It\n            follows that the reversal of the judgment should be without prejudice to the right of defendants to plead\n            the agreement in bar of plaintiff's suit and without prejudice also to plaintiff's right to avoid the agreement\n            by pleading that her attorney was without authority to make it. These are issues to be settled by the jury\n            or the court in a trial of the case.\n\n240 S.W.2d at 292. Similarly in Quintero v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 654 S.W.2d 442 (Tex.1983), we held that the trial court\nerred by rendering an agreed judgment of dismissal based on a release signed by plaintiff because plaintiff did not consent to the\njudgment at the time it was rendered. We noted, however, that “our reversal of the judgment of dismissal is without prejudice\nto the rights of the Jim Walter Homes in its attempt to plead and prove an enforceable settlement agreement under the release.”\n654 S.W.2d at 444.

J. 663\n\n\n [9] An action to enforce a settlement agreement, where consent is withdrawn, must be based on proper pleading and proof.\nSee Quintero, 654 S.W.2d at 444; Browning, 620 S.W.2d at 615. In this case, for example, Padilla filed a counterclaim seeking\nenforcement of the parties' agreement, and both sides moved for summary judgment on that claim. As previously discussed,\nthe summary judgment evidence established an enforceable settlement agreement as a matter of law. The trial court therefore\nshould have granted Padilla's motion for summary judgment and enforced the agreement.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\nENOCH, Justice, joined by GAMMAGE, Justice, dissenting.\nToday the Court holds that a settlement agreement is an enforceable Rule 11 agreement despite the fact that it never complied\nwith all requirements of the rule before the existence and terms of the agreement became disputed. But for this Court's prior\nopinion in Kennedy v. Hyde, 682 S.W.2d 525 (Tex.1984), I would agree that the settlement agreement in this case is enforceable\nas a binding contract between the parties regardless of whether it is ever filed as a Rule 11 agreement. Kennedy, however,\nengrafted the Rule 11 requirements on the substantive principles of contract law. In my view, Kennedy, unless overruled,\ncompels us to conclude that the settlement agreement in this case is unenforceable because, although the agreement is otherwise\nenforceable as a binding contract, it did not comport with the requirements of Rule 11 at the time Padilla sought to enforce\nthe agreement. I respectfully dissent.\n\nIn Kennedy, the parties reached an oral settlement agreement. The agreement was reduced to writing and signed by all but\none defendant, Kennedy. The plaintiffs amended their pleadings to enforce the oral settlement agreement against Kennedy.\nKennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 526. This Court reversed the judgment of the courts below enforcing the oral settlement agreement,\nholding that the oral settlement agreement was unenforceable under Rule 11 because the agreement was not in writing and\nsigned by Kennedy. Id. at 530.\n\nI begin by noting that Kennedy represents a significant departure from our Rule 11 jurisprudence and substantive contract law.\nPrior to Kennedy, this Court never held that to be enforceable as a contract, a settlement agreement must comply with Rule 11.\nIn *463 Williams v. Hollingsworth, 568 S.W.2d 130, 131 (Tex.1978) and Vickrey v. American Youth Camps, Inc., 532 S.W.2d\n292 (Tex.1976) (per curiam), this Court purportedly “strongly implied” that settlement agreements were subject to Rule 11.\nKennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 528. The implication, if any, is neither strong nor persuasive. In Williams, the Court only held that\na valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one of the parties is lacking. Williams, 568 S.W.2d\nat 131. Because one party was not present or represented by counsel at the time an agreed judgment was rendered, that party\nhad not consented to the agreed judgment. Id. at 132.\n\nThe reliance on Vickrey is even more dubious. In that case, the Court in a per curiam opinion simply recited in its statement\nof the facts that a settlement was dictated in open court pursuant to Rule 11. Vickrey, 532 S.W.2d at 292. One party appealed\nthe judgment that had been rendered based on the dictated settlement on the grounds that it did not conform to the settlement\nthat had been reached between the parties. Id. at 292. The Court reversed the judgment holding that a final judgment based on\na settlement agreement must be in “strict or literal compliance” with that agreement. Id. Like the issue in Williams, the issue in\nVickrey was whether the trial court had the power to render the judgment it did based on the settlement, not whether a settlement\nagreement is an otherwise enforceable settlement agreement absent compliance with Rule 11.\n\nBy reaching out to render settlement agreements subject to Rule 11, the Court engrafted new requirements onto the substantive\nlaw of contracts, thus exceeding the Court's rule-making authority. TEX.GOV'T CODE § 22.004. Section 22.004(a) grants this\nCourt the full authority to make rules for practice and procedure in civil actions, “except that its rules may not abridge, enlarge,\nor modify the substantive rights of a litigant.” Id. § 22.004(a). Under Kennedy, an oral settlement agreement, although otherwise\nenforceable at common law, becomes unenforceable unless made in open court, and thus made part of the court record. It is\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              9\n\fPadilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (1995)\n38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 663\n\ndifficult to conceive of a clearer abridgment of the substantive rights of a litigant than to refuse to enforce a valid contract\nbecause the parties did not comply with a rule of procedure.\n\nThe Court recognized that its holding in Kennedy might abridge the substantive law of contracts, but dismissed this concern\nby concluding that the Legislature had sanctioned its interpretation of Rule 11 by failing to disapprove of the rule. Kennedy,\n682 S.W.2d at 529. The Legislature's failure to disapprove of Rule 11, according to the Court, may be viewed as signifying\nits acquiescence in the Court's interpretations of Rule 11's predecessors. While this may be true, it is only true if the Court's\ninterpretations of Rule 11's predecessors have subjected otherwise enforceable settlement agreements to Rule 11 and rendered\nsuch contracts unenforceable for failure to comply with the rule. None of the Court's prior interpretations have so held.\n\nNor is such an interpretation “presaged” by the Court's earlier interpretations in Birdwell v. Cox, 18 Tex. 535 (1857) or Matthews\nv. Looney, 132 Tex. 313, 123 S.W.2d 871 (1939). See Kennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 529. Birdwell simply involved an agreement\nto postpone trial until some depositions could be taken. Birdwell, 18 Tex. at 535–36. In Matthews, the parties in a will contest\nreached a settlement but before judgment, disputes arose concerning the terms of the settlement between the parties. Matthews,\n123 S.W.2d at 871–72. Although the Court noted that the agreement had not been reduced to writing or rendered of record with\nthe trial court, the Court held that the trial court lacked authority to enter a judgment because the terms were in dispute. Id. at\n873. In other words, the parties had not consented to the terms of the settlement at the time they sought a judgment. Matthews\nsimply stands for the correct proposition that a judgment may not be rendered based on a settlement if a party withdraws its\nconsent prior to the judgment. Neither Birdwell nor Matthews justify the Court's action in Kennedy.\n\nWhile I believe Kennedy is wrongly decided, it is the law and should either be followed or overruled in this case. My criticism\nof the Court is that it does neither. Assuming the *464 Court continues to adhere to the holding in Kennedy, Rule 11 requires\nthat three conditions be met before an agreement will be enforceable: (1) a writing, (2) that is signed, (3) and that has been\nfiled with the court. London Market Cos. v. Schattman, 811 S.W.2d 550, 552 (Tex.1991) (per curiam). Once the existence or\nterms of such an agreement becomes disputed, it is unenforceable unless it comports with all three of these requirements. Id.;\nKennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 530. Accordingly, if a purported agreement is in writing and has been signed, but becomes disputed\nbefore it has been filed with the court, the agreement is unenforceable under Rule 11. See Kennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 530 (oral\nagreement was unenforceable at the moment its existence was disputed in pleadings).\n\nRecognizing that Kennedy hangs like an albatross around its neck, the Court deals with the filing requirement of Rule 11 in\nsuch a way as to, in effect, hold that an agreement need only be in writing and signed to be enforceable. According to the Court,\nthe parties need not file an agreement with the court except and until one party disputes the existence or terms of the agreement\n—filing of the document is a mere technicality. Yet the predecessor to Rule 11, Rule 47, was amended in 1877 to specifically\nrequire that agreements be filed with the court to be enforceable. 47 Tex. 597, 625 (1877). In light of this fact, there can be\nlittle justification for today's judicial revision. An amendment to a rule must be presumed to have made some change in existing\nlaw and the Court must endeavor to give some effect to the amendment. American Surety Co. v. Axtell Co., 120 Tex. 166, 36\nS.W.2d 715, 719–20 (1931). To the contrary, the Court effectively eliminates the filing requirement from Rule 11.\n\nMoreover, the Court's construction trivializing the filing requirement arguably defeats the purposes of Rule 11. Rule 11 ensures\n(1) that agreements of counsel which affect the interest of their clients not be left to the fallibility of human recollection,\nWyss v. Bookman, 235 S.W. 567, 569 (Tex.Comm'n App.1921, holding approved); and (2) that agreements themselves not\nbecome sources of controversy impeding resolution of suits. Kennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 530. In addition, Rule 11 also operates\nto prevent the trial judge from having to place the parties' attorneys on the stand and determine which one is telling the truth.\nSee Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. McCollum, 656 S.W.2d 527, 529 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Stated another way,\nthe significance of Rule 11 is to formalize the procedures for entering into agreements concerning a pending lawsuit so that the\ncourt can extricate itself from controversies ancillary to the underlying litigation. The filing element, if it has any purpose at\nall, surely is designed to make the parties focus on an agreement and recognize that not only have the terms of the agreement\nbeen memorialized in writing but also that they have the imprimatur of a court record. The filing requirement thus adds to the\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             10\n\fPadilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (1995)\n38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 663\n\nformality of the process and reduces uncertainty and the likelihood that the agreements will become a source of controversy\ndistracting the court and the parties from the case at hand.\n\nI suspect that the Court reduces the filing requirement to a matter of little consequence because it is absurd to hold that a contract\nwould not be enforceable simply because it has not been filed with the court. Yet if we are going to continue to insist that our\nsubstantive contract law be modified by Rule 11, we should at least be consistent in our readings. To be enforced, a settlement\nagreement must be in writing, signed, and filed at the time either its existence or the terms of the agreement become disputed.\nKennedy, if correct, compels us to conclude that the agreement in this case is unenforceable because it became disputed before\nit complied with the Rule 11 filing requirement. Because the Court chooses not to address Kennedy, it takes the questionable\nroute of trivializing the filing requirement of Rule 11 to the point of nonexistence. If there is value to Rule 11's requirement\nthat an agreement be on file with the Court, then that value should not be destroyed. If there is no value to the mere filing of an\nagreement, then the Court should amend Rule 11 to delete the requirement. I dissent.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 663\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      The record does not disclose whether Carry was an attorney, legal assistant, or secretary.\n2      Shortly after refusing the settlement funds, Steidley sent another letter to Chandler contending that State Farm had acted in bad faith\n        by not settling the case for the policy limits, demanding $2.75 million from Padilla and State Farm in extra-contractual damages.\n3       The new argument was based on section 154.071(a) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which provides:\n              If the parties reach a settlement and execute a written agreement disposing of the dispute, the agreement is enforceable in the\n              same manner as any other written contract.\n           This section is contained in Title 7 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, regarding referral of cases to alternative dispute\n           resolution.\n4       The transcript contains a “Notice of Oral Hearing,” filed by Padilla on June 12, indicating that the motion for reconsideration would\n        be “presented to the court for ruling with an oral hearing” on June 22, 1992.\n5       The court's order did, however, address section 154.071(a) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which was raised only\n        in the two later motions.\n6       Padilla argues that the LaFrances have waived this argument because they did not raise it in this Court by separate application for\n        writ of error. Padilla relies on the requirement that a party who seeks a different and more favorable judgment in this Court than\n        that rendered by the court of appeals must file his or her own application for writ of error, rather than merely raising the argument\n        by a responsive cross-point. See Donwerth v. Preston II Chrysler–Dodge, Inc., 775 S.W.2d 634, 639 n. 5 (Tex.1989); Archuleta v.\n        International Ins. Co., 667 S.W.2d 120, 123 (Tex.1984). The LaFrances' cross-point, however, does not seek a different and more\n        favorable judgment. Although a judgment of dismissal would be different from the actual judgment of the court of appeals affirming\n        the judgment of the trial court, the end results would be equally favorable. In either case, the trial court's summary judgment in favor\n        of the LaFrances remains undisturbed. The LaFrances were thus entitled to raise the dismissal argument by cross-point.\n7       Although the trial court signed the order granting summary judgment for the LaFrances on the settlement issue on October 19, 1992,\n        it did not sever this issue until November 20, 1992. The latter date controls the appellate timetable.\n8       Because the primary purpose of Rule 11 is to require the parties to reduce their agreements to writing, the Court in Kennedy refused\n        to enforce an oral settlement agreement.\n9       The LaFrances argue that there is no summary judgment evidence that Bradshaw, who was not an attorney, was authorized to negotiate\n        a settlement or enter a binding Rule 11 agreement on Padilla's behalf. We disagree. The record reflects that Chandler, who was\n        Padilla's attorney, was the one who forwarded the LaFrances settlement offer to Bradshaw, and it was Chandler who procured the\n        settlement checks from Bradshaw and tendered them to Steidley. Moreover, Steidley knew that Bradshaw was negotiating on behalf\n        of Padilla and that he was at least purporting to act as Padilla's agent. Under these circumstances, even if Bradshaw did not have actual\n        authority to settle the lawsuit, Padilla was entitled to ratify Bradshaw's actions, thereby creating a binding agreement. See Restatement\n        (Second) of Agency, § 87. Padilla clearly ratified the agreement by tendering the settlement funds and seeking enforcement.\n\n\n End of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

By the underlying suit, Diane Morgan f/k/a Diane Parham (Diane) sought to avoid a transfer of\nthe subject property as a fraudulent transfer as well as a declaration that the September 22, 2007 deed purporting to accomplish\nthe transfer is void. The trial court granted partial summary judgment on the attempted transfer, declared the deed void, signed\na final judgment awarding Diane attorney's fees, and enjoined appellants Parham Family Limited Partnership (Partnership) and\nVan E. Parham, Jr. (Van Jr.) from pursuing their collateral suit regarding the subject property.\n\nOn appeal, Parham Enterprises, Inc. (PEI) and Rhetta Parham (Rhetta), the president of PEI, urge the trial court erred by (a)\ngranting the motion for partial summary judgment, (b) enforcing an “expired” temporary injunction, and (c) awarding Diane\nattorney's fees despite a failure to segregate. Partnership and Van Jr. challenge the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over\nDiane's suit and Diane's standing to seek injunctive relief against them. Partnership and Van Jr. also assert the trial court erred\nin entering the injunction against them. As explained below, we affirm the trial court's judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n                                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\nDiane was married to Shawn Parham in June 2004. On June 22, 2004, Shawn conveyed the subject property to PEI. PEI is a\ncorporation that was owned and controlled by Van Parham, Sr. and Rhetta. Diane worked for PEI until she and Shawn were\nseparated in August 2005; they were divorced in May 2006.\n\nOn September 22, 2007, Rhetta, as president of PEI, signed a deed attempting to convey the subject property to Partnership.\nHowever, it is undisputed that the warranty deed identified the wrong lot within the Farmette Meadows Section and named\na non-existent entity, Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2, as grantee. The warranty deed, including these errors, was\nrecorded in the real property records of Harris County. In July 2008, Diane obtained a judgment against PEI for around $82,500\nin County Court at Law No. 3 related to PEI's unauthorized use of her personal credit cards. The transfer of the subject property\noccurred during the pendency of the credit card dispute. Diane attempted to execute her judgment against PEI once it became\nfinal, but was unsuccessful. She abstracted this judgment in the Harris County deed records on September 22, 2008.\n\nOn January 28, 2009, Diane, as a judgment creditor, filed a petition to set aside deed, for declaratory judgment, for fraudulent\ntransfer and for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and temporary injunction. She named PEI and Rhetta as defendants. Diane\nasserted that the September 22, 2007 deed conveying Lot 1 was a fraudulent conveyance of the subject property to a non-\nexistent entity made to “delay, hinder, or defraud” Diane in her efforts to collect that judgment. Diane sought to set aside “the\npurported transfer and an order of sale ... for disposition and satisfaction of [her] judgment,” a declaratory judgment, a TRO and\ntemporary injunction against further conveyances of the subject property, actual damages that “exceed $84,000 but are within\nthe jurisdictional limits of this court,” and attorney's fees. The trial court issued a TRO on February 2 and set the hearing on\nthe temporary injunction for February 13.\n\nOn February 13, Diane obtained a temporary injunction against PEI and Rhetta, prohibiting them from “deeding, transferring\nor conveying” Lot 1. The trial court set the matter for trial on July 15.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\n *778 On February 27, Van Jr. and Partnership filed a petition in intervention (mistakenly styled an “interpleader”), asserting\nan interest in the subject property. Diane filed an amended petition naming Van Parham Sr., Van Jr., Partnership, and V.E.\nParham Jr. Management Corp. as additional defendants. She also added claims for conspiracy and exemplary damages against\nall the defendants.\n\nDuring the remainder of 2009, the defendants filed and continued various dispositive motions. The parties agreed to continue\nnumerous trial settings and the parties unsuccessfully mediated. In 2010, the trial court denied all of the defendants' dispositive\nmotions, Van Sr. passed away, and Diane amended her petition to remove Van Sr. and V.E. Parham Jr. Management Corp.\nas parties and delete her claim for exemplary damages. And, the parties agreed to more continuances, moving the trial into\n2011. On September 19, 2011, Diane filed a motion for partial summary judgment against PEI only. In this motion, she sought\njudgment on her claims for declaratory judgment and for fraudulent transfer. This motion was set for submission on October 7.\nDiane attached to her motion (1) a copy of the recorded deed on the subject property, bearing the two errors in lot and grantee,\n(2) a certificate from the Texas Secretary of State certifying that there is no record of any business entity, foreign or domestic, by\nthe name of Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2, 1 and (3) evidence in support of her fraudulent transfer claim, including\nan appraisal of the subject property at the time of the purported transfer. Rhetta and PEI responded to Diane's motion for partial\nsummary judgment. Intervenors 2 Partnership and Van Jr. also filed a response to Diane's motion.\n\nLater in September, Diane filed a third amended petition restating her previous claims; and adding a claim for piercing the\ncorporate veil against Rhetta, seeking to hold her individually liable for disregarding the corporate form of PEI. A week later,\nDiane filed a “notice of disobedience of the temporary injunction,” asking the court to hold PEI and Rhetta, individually and\nas president of PEI, in contempt. In this notice, she asserted:\n\n             The Defendants [PEI] and [Rhetta] were served with the Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n             on Thursday, September 15, 2011. In a calculated bad faith attempt to defeat the partial summary\n             judgment motion, the Defendants [PEI] and [Rhetta] violated the Court's Temporary Injunction Order\n             on Friday, September 23, 2011 by filing an amended and alleged corrected Warranty Deed to the subject\n             property Lot 9 with the county clerk.\n\n\nThe trial court heard this motion on October 12. After the hearing, the trial court signed an order holding PEI and Rhetta in\ncontempt. In this order, the trial court declared the deed executed by PEI and Rhetta on September 22, 2011 (filed on September\n23) void and fined Rhetta “$500.00 as punishment for contempt” of the temporary injunction. The trial court further ordered\nPEI and Rhetta to obey the contempt order and the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction. In the order, the trial court stated\nthe temporary injunction “remains in effect for any and all purposes.” The trial court also signed *779 a trial setting that day,\nsetting the case for trial on January 23, 2012.\n\nTwo days before the hearing on Diane's motion for contempt, Diane filed a motion to strike the intervention of Partnership and\nVan Jr. At a hearing on October 19, 2011, Diane orally dropped her conspiracy claims against all the parties. The trial court\nsigned a partial non-suit with prejudice of these claims that same date. The trial court also signed an order granting Diane's\nmotion to strike the intervention of Partnership and Van Jr. According to the trial court's findings, Partnership and Van Jr. filed\na motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration in response to the trial court's order striking their intervention. 3\n\nDiane filed an amended petition on November 7 naming only PEI and Rhetta as defendants. In this petition, Diane sought to set\naside the September 22, 2007 deed, a declaratory judgment that this deed was void, and alternative relief for fraudulent transfer,\npiercing the corporate veil, and fraud. She further alleged that the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction remained in effect.\n\nOn January 17, 2012, Partnership and Van Jr. filed an action to quiet title to the subject property in Harris County Probate\nCourt No. 1, which was overseeing the probate of the estate of Van Sr. This quiet-title action was based on the September 22,\n2007 deed. On January 19, PEI and Rhetta filed a motion in the underlying cause here to transfer venue to the probate court.\nThe motion also complained that, due to the amount in controversy, the court did not have jurisdiction, and that the court had\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\nimproperly excluded necessary parties by striking Partnership/Van Jr.'s petition in intervention. Although Diane responded to\nthe motion, it appears that the motion was neither set for hearing nor ruled upon.\n\nOn January 23, 2012, the trial court signed an order granting Diane's September 19 motion for partial summary judgment against\nPEI. Specifically, the trial court's order: “GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant\nParham Enterprises, Inc. regarding the issue that the warranty deed executed on September 22, 2007 is void.”\n\nThe next day, the trial court signed an order denying Partnership and Van Jr.'s motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration.\nAlso on January 24, Diane and PEI proceeded to a jury trial on the issue of attorney's fees only. 4 After a brief jury trial, the\njury returned a verdict finding Diane's reasonable and necessary attorney's fees for preparation and trial to be $75,000, for an\nappeal to the court of appeals to be $25,000, and for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas to be $15,000.\n\nFollowing the trial, Diane filed an amended petition on February 6, 2012, listing Partnership and Van Jr. as “intervenors.” In\naddition to the claims listed above that Diane had raised in her previous pleadings, she sought an anti-suit TRO and temporary\ninjunction against Partnership and Van Jr., enjoining them from pursuing their “mirror lawsuit” to quiet title. The trial court\ngranted the TRO on February 8 and set the temporary injunction for a hearing on February 20. Counsel for Partnership and Van\nJr. appeared *780 at the February 8 hearing on the TRO as “amici curiae.”\n\nDiane's February 15 motion for temporary injunction against Partnership and Van Jr. cited Texas Civil Practice & Remedies\nCode section 65.011, which provides, “A writ of injunction may be granted if a party performs or is about to perform ... an\nact relating to the subject of pending litigation, in violation of the rights of the applicant, and the act would tend to render the\njudgment in that litigation ineffectual; the applicant is entitled to a writ of injunction under the principles of equity and the\nstatutes of this state relating to injunction.” 5 She noted in this motion that “on the eve of trial,” she was served with citation\nand a copy of the intervenors' original petition for declaratory judgment in the probate court regarding the deed/title to the\nsubject property. She alleged that in this “mirror lawsuit,” Partnership and Van Jr. were attempting to re-litigate the identical\nissues regarding the deed/title to the subject property, which was the subject of “this pending litigation.” She stated that on\nJanuary 23, the trial court had signed a partial summary judgment in her favor, in which the court had issued an order that the\nSeptember 22, 2007 deed issued by PEI was void. She further noted that on January 24, 2012, the trial court signed an order\ndenying Partnership's motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration. She asserted that the trial court had jurisdiction over\nPartnership and Van Jr. because they consented to the court's jurisdiction regarding their motion for new trial, which was not\ndenied until January 24, 2012. Diane also alleged she was entitled to an anti-suit temporary injunction to address a threat to\nthe court's jurisdiction, to prevent the evasion of important public policy, to prevent a multiplicity of suits, or to protect a party\nfrom vexatious or harassing litigation, citing Bridas Corp. v. Unocal Corp. and Golden Rule Insurance v. Harper. 6\n\nPartnership and Van Jr. responded to this motion, “without waiving citation, service of process, or making a general appearance.”\nThey asserted that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case because the property in question was valued\nat over $300,000, which exceeded the jurisdictional limits of the maximum amount in controversy for statutory county courts\nin Harris County. They further claimed that, rather than maintaining the status quo, as a temporary injunction was intended\nto do, granting a temporary injunction in this case would destroy the status quo. They asserted that the probate court had now\nobtained dominant jurisdiction over their claims, which was evidenced by the need for Diane to seek leave of court to amend her\npleadings, post-jury trial and concurrently with the temporary injunction hearing. Citing United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co.\nv. Beuhler, they alleged that a plaintiff may not dismiss claims against defendants, proceed to a jury trial without them, and after\na trial on the merits, rejoin them as a party in the same case, particularly as intervenors. 7 Finally, they contended that Diane\nwas judicially estopped from obtaining injunctive relief against them because she had them struck and dismissed from the case.\n\n *781 After an evidentiary hearing on February 20, 2012, at which counsel for all parties and putative parties appeared, the\ntrial court granted the temporary injunction, as well as granting Diane leave to amend her petition. Bond was set at $1,000, and\nthe case was set for trial on the permanent injunction on June 4, 2012.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\n\n\nPartnership and Van Jr. filed a plea to the jurisdiction and answer on February 27. In their plea to the jurisdiction, they asserted\nthat the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the property at issue was valued above the jurisdictional limits of\nthe statutory county court at law. They also filed a verified denial, urging that there was a defect in parties—they were named as\nintervenors after their petition in intervention had been struck. They asserted that no such intervention existed and that because\nDiane had proceeded to a jury trial on the merits, she could no longer, post-trial, sue them as intervenors in an adjudicated\nmatter. Subject to several affirmative defenses, they filed a general denial.\n\n\nAlso on February 27, the trial court signed an interlocutory judgment. 8 In this interlocutory judgment, the trial court included\nthe following regarding summary judgment regarding the void deed:\n\n\n  Plaintiff Diane Morgan timely filed a motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc.\n  regarding the issue that the warranty deed attempting to transfer the title to [the subject property] was void.\n\n     On January 23, 2012, the Court, after considering the pleadings, the motion, the affidavits, the response of the Defendant,\n     the response of the Interveners, the law, and the facts, granted the Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment against\n     the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. The Order is attached as Exhibit ‘A’ and incorporated by reference.\n\n     The court hereby renders judgment for Plaintiff Diane Morgan that the warranty deed attempting to transfer title to the\n     subject property ... and executed on or about September 22, 2007 is void.\n\n   (emphasis added). This interlocutory judgment also iterated the jury verdict on fees against PEI, and the February 13, 2009\n   temporary injunction against Partnership and the February 20, 2012 temporary injunction against Partnership and Van Jr.\nAt the June 4, 2012 evidentiary hearing on the permanent injunction, counsel for Partnership and Van Jr. again raised the issue\nthat they had been brought into the case as intervenors even though their petition in intervention had been struck and Diane\nhad non-suited her claims against them:\n\n  This Court on October the 12th [2011] had a hearing. And at that hearing Diane Morgan's counsel nonsuited my clients\n  and nonsuited with prejudice. The Court signed off on an order on October 19th nonsuiting with prejudice any conspiracy\n  claims. Then what transpired is the Court in—well, actually Diane Morgan filed a fourth amended petition. And in that fourth\n  amended petition, she dropped all claims against Parham Family Limited Partnership and Dr. Van E. Parham, Jr.\n\n  The Court also struck the intervention that my clients filed back in October as well. Therefore, they ceased being parties at\n  the very latest at the beginning of November. The Court proceeded to go to trial on the merits. It was a jury *782 trial. The\n  Court granted a motion for summary judgment at the end of January prior to trial and then went right into a jury trial to which\n  the Parham Family Limited Partnership and Dr. Van E. Parham were not parties, nor were they given notice of the trial.\n\n  Your Honor, I'm not sure what—the Court granted a post-trial leave to amend for Diane Morgan in which she has sued my\n  clients as intervenors which the Court struck back in October.\n\n  Your Honor, under the Rules of Procedure, once you proceed to trial, anything that's not submitted at that point in time is\n  abandoned and under 165 that's exactly what we have here. Is Ms. Morgan asking the Court for a new trial?\n\nThe trial court responded that it had already ruled on Partnership's and Van Jr.'s motion to dismiss by denying it and asked the\nparties to proceed on the permanent injunction hearing. Both sides presented evidence and argument. On June 11, 2012, the trial\ncourt signed an order granting a permanent injunction “restraining the Interveners from prosecuting a mirror lawsuit regarding\nthe deed/title to Lot 9 in Harris County Probate court No. [1] or any other Court.”\nThe trial court signed a final judgment on August 8, 2012. This judgment provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

ANALYSIS\n\nA. Jurisdictional Issues\nIn their first two issues, Partnership and Van Jr. challenge the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over the case below and\nDiane's standing to seek injunctive relief against them. Because these issues attack the jurisdiction of the trial court, we address\nthem first.\n\n\n1. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\nPartnership and Van Jr. assert that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings below because the\namount in controversy exceeded the trial court's statutory authority. Subject matter jurisdiction may not be conferred by consent\nor waiver, and its absence may be raised at any time. Carroll v. Carroll, 304 S.W.3d 366, 367 (Tex.2010) (citing Tex. Ass'n\nof Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 445 (Tex.1993)). Whether a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction is a\nquestion of law we review de novo. Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm'n v. IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex.2002).\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              9\n\fParham Family Ltd. Partnership v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\n [1] Here, Partnership and Van Jr. contend that Diane alleged the property at issue in this case was worth $340,000, which\nexceeds the Texas Legislature's grant of jurisdiction to statutory county courts at law over amounts in controversy between\n$500 and $200,000. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1). 10 Section 25.0003 of the Texas Government Code governs\nthe general jurisdiction of statutory county courts and proscribes the monetary jurisdictional limits of them. See id. § 25.0003.\nBut section 25.1032 of the Government Code contains additional jurisdictional provisions particular to Harris County civil\ncourts at law. See id. § 25.1032. Subsections 25.1032(c)(1) and (3) provide the Harris County civil courts at law jurisdiction\nto “decide the issue of title to real or personal property” and to “hear a suit for the enforcement of a lien on real property.”\nId. § 25.1032(c)(1), (3).\n\nDiane brought this suit to decide the issue of title to real property. She sought a determination of whether title to Lot 9 remained\nwith PEI or had been conveyed to another. See id. § 25.1032(c)(1). Additionally, Diane sought to enforce the judgment lien\nfrom her prior suit in County Civil Court at Law No. 3 against Lot 9 if it found the deed void. See id. § 25.1032(c)(3). Indeed,\nPartnership and Van Jr. acknowledge in their briefing that Diane is “trying to establish and determine title to real property,”\nalbeit they claim it is “regarding a sale to which she was not a party or has a justiciable interest.” The jurisdiction provided by\nsection 25.1032 is based on the subject matter of the claim, not the amount in controversy. See AIC *784 Mgmt. v. Crews,\n246 S.W.3d 640, 644 (Tex.2008) (“Section 25.1032(c)(1) thus bases the county civil courts' jurisdiction on the type of claim,\nnot the amount of money in dispute.”); see also Haas v. Ashford Hollow Comty. Improvement Ass'n, Inc., 209 S.W.3d 875, 880\n(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.) (same). Thus, we conclude that County Court at Law No. 3 properly exercised\nsubject matter jurisdiction over this matter based on the type of claims Diane brought.\n\n [2] Further, we review de novo whether a pleader has alleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate subject matter jurisdiction.\nTex. Dep't of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex.2004). We construe pleadings liberally in favor of the\nplaintiff and look to the pleader's intent. See id. (citing Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d at 446). The plaintiff's allegations in the\npetition regarding the amount in controversy control for jurisdictional purposes unless the party challenging jurisdiction pleads\nand proves that the allegations were made fraudulently to obtain jurisdiction. Cont'l Coffee Prods. Co. v. Cazarez, 937 S.W.2d\n444, 449 (Tex.1996); see also Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224 n. 4; Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex.2000).\n\n [3] Here, in her original petition, Diane alleged damages exceeding $84,000 but “within the jurisdictional limits of this court.”\nPartnership and Van Jr. neither pleaded nor proved that Diane's allegations of the amount in controversy were made fraudulently\nfor the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction. Thus, the allegations in her petition regarding the amount in controversy control for\njurisdictional purposes. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224 n. 4; Cont'l Coffee, 937 S.W.2d at 449. Section 25.0003(c)(1) of the Texas\nGovernment Code provides jurisdiction for statutory county courts over matters in controversy between $500 and $200,000 “as\nalleged on the face of the petition.” Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1) (emphasis added). As noted above, the jurisdictional\nmaximum amount in controversy at the time Diane filed her suit was $100,000. Diane's allegation of damages on the face of her\npetition falls below this maximum amount; thus, the trial court had jurisdiction over this matter even under the more general\nprovision of jurisdiction provided by section 25.0003. 11\n\n [4] Finally, with certain exceptions not relevant here, when jurisdiction is lawfully and properly acquired, no later fact or event\ndeprives the court of jurisdiction. Cont'l Coffee, 937 S.W.2d at 449; Kubovy v. Cypress–Fairbanks Indep. Sch. Dist., 972 S.W.2d\n130, 133 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.). Thus, once the trial court properly obtained subject matter *785\njurisdiction over this matter, it did not later lose it based on the contents of its judgment, as asserted by Partnership and Van Jr.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that County Civil Court at Law No. 3 properly acquired subject matter jurisdiction over\nDiane's suit. We therefore overrule Partnership's and Van Jr.'s first issue.\n\n\n2. Diane's Standing\nPartnership and Van Jr. assert that Diane lacked standing to seek an anti-suit injunction against them because she lacked any\ninterest in the subject property “without a perfected judgment lien.” A party must have standing to maintain suit. See Tex. Ass'n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               10\n\fParham Family Ltd. Partnership v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\nof Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex 1993). Under Texas law, a plaintiff has standing to bring suit if\nshe has suffered a distinct injury, and there exists a real controversy between the parties that will be determined by the judicial\ndetermination sought. Brown v. Todd, 53 S.W.3d 297, 305 (Tex.2011). The requirement that a real controversy exist between\nthe parties that will be determined by the trial court refers to the presentation of a justiciable interest. Salas v. LNV Corp., 409\nS.W.3d 209, 216 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.).\n\n [5] Partnership and Van Jr. assert that there is no real controversy between the parties that will be determined by any judicial\ndeclaration sought because PEI sold the subject property to Partnership before Diane's “failed attempts to perfect a judgment\nlien or interest in the property.” In other words, Partnership and Van Jr. argue that Diane cannot have standing because the\ntransfer about which she complains took place nine months prior to Diane's claim against PEI resulting in judgment. 12 But\ntheir assertion ignores the provisions of the Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act that include “creditor's claim[s that] arose\nbefore or within a reasonable time after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred.” Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §\n24.005(a) (emphasis added). Thus, Partnership and Van Jr.'s argument begs the entire question of Diane's case: Is the September\n22, 2007 deed purporting to transfer the subject property void as a fraudulent conveyance or otherwise?\n\nIf the purported conveyance failed to transfer the property to Partnership, then title of the property remained with PEI, and\nDiane's judgment lien against PEI attached. Thus, Diane had a clear justiciable interest in whether her judgment lien attached to\na property she alleges was fraudulently transferred to Partnership to defeat her monetary claim against PEI; the Texas Uniform\nFraudulent Transfer Act provides that justiciable interest because she was not a party to the transaction. For the foregoing\nreasons, we overrule Partnership's and Van Jr.'s challenge to Diane's standing to bring this suit. 13\n\nHaving addressed the jurisdictional issues presented by Partnership and Van Jr., we turn to the trial court's summary *786\njudgment declaring the September 22, 2007 deed void.\n\n\nB. Validity of the Deed\nIn PEI and Rhetta's first issue, they assert that the trial court erred in declaring this deed void by traditional summary judgment\nbecause Diane failed to conclusively establish that the deed lacked the legal requisites to qualify as a deed.\n\nWe review the trial court's granting of a summary judgment de novo. Ferguson v. Bldg. Materials Corp. of Am., 295 S.W.3d\n642, 644 (Tex.2009) (per curiam). To be entitled to summary judgment under Rule 166a(c), a movant must establish that there\nis no genuine issue of material fact so that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Mann Frankfort Stein &\nLipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex.2009). We take as true all evidence favorable to the nonmovant and\nresolve any doubt in the nonmovant's favor. 20801, Inc. v. Parker, 249 S.W.3d 392, 399 (Tex.2008). We consider the evidence\npresented in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting evidence favorable to the nonmovant if reasonable fact finders\ncould, and disregarding evidence contrary to the nonmovant unless reasonable fact finders could not. Mann Frankfort, 289\nS.W.3d at 848.\n\n\n1. The Trial Court Grants Summary Judgment on All Bases\n [6] PEI and Rhetta argue that the trial court's summary judgment should be reversed because their evidence conclusively\nestablished the grantee's existence. They do not urge an issue concerning Diane's fraudulent transfer claim. Instead, they state\nthat the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment solely on the basis of the declaratory judgment act claim. We\ndisagree.\n\nDiane sought partial summary judgment. By her motion, Diane asked the trial court to set aside the deed and return the subject\nproperty to PEI. Diane argued both that (a) PEI failed in its attempt to transfer the subject property because the deed was\ndefective and (b) PEI violated Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act section 24.005. See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §\n24.005. The trial court granted the motion for partial summary judgment. The trial court did not grant the motion for partial\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             11\n\fParham Family Ltd. Partnership v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\nsummary judgment in part. When it incorporated the summary judgment order into the judgment, the trial court stated: “On\nJanuary 23, 2012, the Court, after considering the pleadings, the motion, the affidavits, the response of the Defendants, the\nresponse of the Interveners, the law, and the facts granted Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant\nParham Enterprises, Inc.”\n\nNevertheless, PEI and Rhetta urge that the motion was granted in part. They appear to rely upon a single sentence in the summary\njudgment order as a limit on the grounds for granting. Specifically, the trial court's summary judgment order also stated: “The\nGrantee, Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2, was not in existence at the time the deed was executed.” However, this\nis merely a statement of an undisputed fact. The order does not purport to resolve only the legal effect of the undisputed fact.\nInstead, the summary judgment order declares the deed void, which is precisely the relief Diane sought on both her declaratory\njudgment claim and her fraudulent transfer claim. Based upon the plain language of the order, we conclude that the trial court\ngranted Diane's motion for partial summary judgment on both her Declaratory Judgment action and her fraudulent transfer claim.\n\n*787 Further, to the extent that there was any confusion about whether the trial court granted a fraudulent transfer summary\njudgment, 14 the trial court clarified it when, at the trial on the permanent injunction, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n\n  Mr. Toups [Partnership/Van Jr.]: Your Honor, you granted a motion for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment.\n\n     The Court: They both said yes, I set it aside. So, I'm not sure why we're all on a different page.\n\n     Mr. Thomas [Diane]: You declared it void.\n\n     The Court: I declared it void. Okay. Same thing, in my mind. When I declared it void, I considered it in my mind fraudulent\n     and set it aside, hence, the declaring it void.\n\n   (emphasis added).\n [7] For PEI and Rhetta to obtain a reversal of the motion for partial summary judgment, they must attack every ground relied\non for which summary judgment could have been granted. See Malooly Bros. Inc. v. Napier, 461 S.W.2d 119, 121 (Tex.1970).\nWhere an appellant fails to challenge even one of the grounds, the appellate court may affirm the summary judgment on that\nground alone. See Trevino & Assoc. Mech., L.P., 400 S.W.3d 139, 144 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2013, no pet.). Although PEI and\nRhetta do not include an issue on appeal attacking the trial court's summary judgment on fraudulent conveyance, they argue the\nmerits of the claim in the body of their brief. Therefore, we construe the brief to adequately raise the point.\n\n\n2. Declaratory Judgment\n [8] [9] This court has previously stated that “in Texas, a deed is void if the grantee is not in existence at the time the deed\nis executed.” Lighthouse Church of Cloverleaf v. Tex. Bank, 889 S.W.2d 595, 600 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ\ndenied). Diane attached evidence to her summary judgment motion that established that Parham Partnership No. 2 was not in\nexistence at the time the deed was executed; she provided a certificate from the Texas Secretary of State stating that there was\nno record of the existence of this entity. As outlined above, PEI and Rhetta do not dispute this point.\n\nInstead, PEI and Rhetta assert that a deed is not void if the grantee exists but receives the deed in an assumed name, citing\nBuist v. Connell, 233 S.W.2d 458, 462 (Tex.Civ.App.-Eastland 1950, writ. ref'd). They contend that “the fact that Partnership\ndirected that the deed be taken in the name of Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2[ ] would not void or invalidate the\ndeed under the assumed name statutes of Texas.”\n\n [10] In considering grounds for reversal, we are limited to those grounds expressly set forth in the summary-judgment motions,\nanswers, or other responses, and may not rely on the appellate briefs or summary-judgment evidence. D.M. Diamond Corp. v.\nDunbar Armored, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 655, 659–60 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.) (op. on reh'g) (citing Tex.R.\nCiv. P. 166a(c); McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 341 (Tex.1993)). These grounds were not presented\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                           12\n\fParham Family Ltd. Partnership v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\nto the trial court by PEI or Rhetta. Instead, PEI and Rhetta maintained *788 in the trial court that both the conveyance to\n“Parham Family Partnership No. 2” and the conveyance of Lot 1, rather than Lot 9, were “clerical errors” that properly could\nbe corrected by a “correction deed” relating back to September 22, 2007. Thus, we may not consider this argument raised for\nthe first time on appeal as a ground for reversing summary judgment.\n\nIn sum, Diane presented conclusive evidence that the deed from PEI, dated September 22, 2007, attempted to convey the subject\nproperty to a non-existent entity. “[I]n Texas, a deed is void if the grantee is not in existence at the time the deed is executed.”\nLighthouse Church of Cloverleaf, 889 S.W.2d at 600. Accordingly, Diane established as a matter of law that the September 22,\n2007 deed was void. The trial court did not err in so declaring.\n\n\n3. Fraudulent Transfer\n [11] PEI and Rhetta argue that Diane was not entitled to summary judgment on her fraudulent transfer claim because there is\na genuine issue of material fact as to both PEI's intent to fraudulently transfer the property and the reasonably equivalent value\nreceived for the property. PEI and Rhetta correctly argue that PEI's intent is an element running through several of Diane's\ntheories of fraudulent transfer. For example, section 24.005(a)(1) permits Diane to avoid the transfer if the “debtor made the\ntransfer ... with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor.” Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 24.005(a)\n(1). Alternatively, section 24.005(a)(2) permits Diane to avoid the transfer without proving PEI's intent if she establishes that\nPEI made the transfer without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer. Diane sought summary\njudgment on both subsections (1) and (2).\n\nPEI and Rhetta responded with, inter alia, the affidavit of Rhetta. She averred that she was an officer and owner of PEI on\nSeptember 22, 2007, when PEI made the subject transfer. She further stated that it was her intent to transfer the subject property\nto Partnership. Rhetta describes the conveyance and the amount paid for the subject property. Finally, Rhetta states that “[t]he\nsale of the property was done to either hinder, delay or defraud Diane Morgan fka Diane Parham.” Thus, Rhetta's affidavit\nsupplies conclusive evidence that she, on behalf of PEI, transferred the subject property with actual intent to hinder, delay,\nor default Diane as creditor in satisfaction of 24.005(a)(1). With such evidence of intent, the parties' dispute over whether the\ntransferor paid reasonably equivalent value for the property under subsection (2) became immaterial. The trial court properly\ngranted the summary judgment on the alternative basis urged.\n\nWe overrule PEI's and Rhetta's first issue.\n\n\nC. Injunctive Relief\nIn their second issue, PEI and Rhetta assert that the trial court abused its discretion in granting and enforcing a procedurally\nflawed temporary injunction and continuing it in its final judgment. Partnership and Van Jr. complain in their third issue that the\ntrial court abused its discretion in issuing a “post-trial anti-suit permanent injunction against dismissed non-parties prohibiting\nthem from prosecuting a quiet-title suit for real property.” We address each of these issues in turn.\n\n\n1. The Temporary Injunction Against PEI and Rhetta\nWe review a trial court's decision to grant a temporary injunction for an abuse of discretion. Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84\nS.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex.2002). A temporary *789 injunction is an extraordinary remedy that does not issue as a matter of right.\nId. Temporary injunction orders are strictly construed to ensure that they comply with Rule 683 of the Texas Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Kaufmann v. Morales, 93 S.W.3d 650, 653 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.). An order that does not\ncomply with this rule “is subject to being declared void and dissolved.” Qwest Comm'ns Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d\n334, 337 (Tex.2000).\n\n [12] First, PEI and Rhetta assert that the temporary injunction issued against them in February 2009 in this case violates Rule\n683 by referring to another document, the September 2007 warranty deed, as grounds for issuance and to describe the acts sought\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             13\n\fParham Family Ltd. Partnership v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\nto be enjoined. A temporary injunction shall be specific in its terms and shall describe in reasonable detail, not by reference to\nthe complaint or other document, the act or acts to be restrained. Tex.R. Civ. P. 683. The order at issue here does not simply\nrefer to another document; rather, it attaches the deed as an exhibit to the temporary injunction. “Rule 683 is not violated when\ndocuments are attached to the injunction and referred to it as part of the injunction because the attachments become part of the\ninjunction itself.” Layton v. Ball, 396 S.W.3d 747, 753 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2013, no pet.) (citing Tex. Pet Foods, Inc. v. State, 529\nS.W.2d 820, 829 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1975, writ. ref'd n.r.e.)).\n\n [13] [14] Next, PEI and Rhetta assert that the temporary injunction expired because the order stated it was set for trial on\nJuly 15, 2009. As noted above, however, there were numerous trial continuances. Further, at the hearing on Diane's motion for\ncontempt filed against PEI and Rhetta for violation of the temporary injunction, held on October 12, 2011, counsel for PEI and\nRhetta never asserted that the temporary injunction was no longer in effect. Instead, counsel asserted that their actions in filing\na correction deed did not violate the temporary injunction. In the court's order of contempt against PEI and Rhetta, the trial\ncourt stated, “The Temporary Injunction issued by this Court was effective from February 13, 2009 and while this litigation is\npending or until further order of this court ....” 15 Thus, PEI and Rhetta have not met their burden, as appellants, to establish that\nthe February 2009 temporary injunction was not still in effect until the trial court entered a judgment on the merits of Diane's\nclaim. See, e.g., Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204 (providing that the purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo\npending a trial on the merits of the litigation's subject matter). 16\n\n [15] Finally, PEI and Rhetta assert that the trial court erred by continuing the February 2009 temporary injunction in the final\njudgment of the trial court. We agree with this portion of their issue. As noted above, the purpose of a temporary injunction\nis to preserve the litigation's *790 subject matter pending a trial on the merits. Id. This purpose is not served by continuing\na temporary injunction in a final judgment; such a process effectively transforms a temporary injunction into a permanent\ninjunction without a trial. See EMC Mortgage Corp. v. Jones, 252 S.W.3d 857, 866 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.) (op. on\nreh'g); EOG Resources, Inc. v. Gutierrez, 75 S.W.3d 50, 53 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2002, no pet.); cf. Kaufmann, 93 S.W.3d\nat 657 (“There are at least two reasons for requiring a trial date on the [temporary injunction] order. One is to prevent the\ninjunction from becoming permanent.”). Thus, the trial court erred by continuing the February 2009 temporary injunction in\nthe final judgment.\n\nAccordingly, we sustain this portion of PEI and Rhetta's second issue and modify the trial court's judgment to remove the\nfollowing language from it:\n\n             The Court issued a Temporary Injunction against the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. on February\n             13, 2009 and restrained the Defendant from deeding, transferring or conveying all or part of the subject\n             property 18610 Tomato Street, Spring, Harris County, Texas 77379 from the date of the Order and while\n             this cause was pending or until further order of the Court. This Temporary Injunction continues against\n             the Defendant until 180 days after all appeals are completed or until further order from this Court.\n\nWe overrule this issue to the extent that it involves complaints about the temporary injunction prior to entry of the final judgment\nand the order of contempt based on it.\n\n\n2. The Permanent Anti–Suit Injunction Against Partnership and Van Jr.\nPartnership and Van Jr. assert that the trial court abused its discretion in entering a permanent “post-trial” anti-suit injunction\nagainst them because (a) they were no longer parties to the suit, (b) they had a legal right to pursue the action to quiet title in\nanother court, and (c) the anti-suit injunction lacks both a cause of action and evidentiary support.\n\nWe begin by noting what is not disputed within this issue. First, Partnership and Van Jr. do not appeal the trial court's order\nstriking their intervention. As such, Partnership and Van, Jr. do not have a justiciable interest in Diane's fraudulent transfer/\ndeclaratory judgment action. Second, Partnership and Van Jr. did not file a motion to strike Diane's post-trial, pre-judgment\namended petition naming them as intervenors and they do not appeal the trial court's grant of leave to file that petition.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              14\n\fParham Family Ltd. Partnership v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, although Partnership and Van Jr. complain that the court held a trial (against PEI on fees) without their participation,\nthey do not complain that they were without notice or an opportunity to be heard on the anti-suit injunction. To the contrary,\nPartnership and Van Jr. participated in the hearing on the anti-suit injunction. Thus, we only address the sufficiency of the\nevidence to enter the anti-suit injunction.\n\n [16] [17] We review an order granting a permanent injunction for an abuse of discretion. Operation Rescue–Nat'l v. Planned\nParenthood of Houston & Se. Tex., Inc., 975 S.W.2d 546, 560 (Tex.1998). “An anti-suit injunction is appropriate in four\ninstances: (1) to address a threat to the court's jurisdiction; (2) to prevent the evasion of important public policy; (3) to prevent\na multiplicity of suits; or (4) to protect a party from vexatious or harassing litigation.” Golden Rule Ins. Co. v. Harper, 925\nS.W.2d 649, 651 (Tex.1996). Although there are “no precise guidelines” for reviewing an anti-suit injunction, we *791 will\nuphold an injunction issued to protect a court's dominant jurisdiction where, if the enjoined party were allowed to proceed, the\ndominant court would lose its ability to proceed with the case. See, e.g., Owens–Illinois, Inc. v. Webb, 809 S.W.2d 899, 902\n(Tex.App.—Texarkana 1991, no writ).\n\n [18] Diane supported her request for anti-suit injunction with evidence that her suit pertained to title to the subject property,\nand that she filed the suit prior to Partnership and Van Jr.'s suit to quiet title in the subject property—also a suit pertaining to\ntitle. The evidence showed that Diane, a judgment creditor, filed her suit alleging that PEI, a judgment debtor, made a fraudulent\nconveyance of the subject property. Her pleading sought to set aside “the purported transfer” of the subject property.\n\nAt the time of Diane's request for anti-suit injunction, the trial court had already granted an affirmative motion for summary\njudgment on Diane's claims and declared the September 22, 2007 deed void. The trial court had already held the attempted\ncorrection deed of September 22, 2011, void as a violation of the court's injunction. Finally, the trial court determined that\nPartnership and Van Jr.'s lawsuit regarding the “deed/title to” the subject property is a “mirror lawsuit.”\n\nPartnership and Van Jr. offer no argument about how the two suits did not or would not interfere with one another. Partnership\nand Van Jr. confine their arguments to the impairment of their rights in the subject property. As noted above, however,\nPartnership and Van Jr. have not appealed the striking of their intervention, and they offer no argument on appeal in support\nof their rights to the fraudulently transferred property. Given the trial court's unchallenged ruling that Partnership and Van Jr.\ndo not have a justiciable interest in the property, that court had the authority to enjoin them from contending otherwise in the\nprobate court. If Partnership and Van Jr. are implying that Partnership accepted the transfer in good faith and for reasonably\nequivalent value, as recognized by Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act section 24.009(a), they neglected to preserve that\nargument in these proceedings through an appeal of their justiciable interest in the property. 17 See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code\nAnn. § 24.009(a) (“A transfer or obligation is not voidable under Section 24.005(a)(1) of this code against a person who took\nin good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any subsequent transferee or obligee.”)\n\nWe therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering an anti-suit injunction to protect its jurisdiction\nover the subject property.\n\n\nD. Segregation of Attorney's Fees\n [19] In PEI's third issue, it asserts that Diane failed to segregate her attorney's fees. PEI further asserts that the appellate\nattorney's fees are not conditioned on Diane's prevailing on appeal.\n\n [20] A failure to segregate attorney's fees can result in the recovery of no such fees. Green Int'l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384,\n389 (Tex.1997). But if no one objects to a jury charge in which the jury is not asked to segregate fees, then the objection is\nwaived. Jackson v. LongAgriBusiness, L.L.C., No. 14–11–01073–CV, 2013 WL 84921, at *4 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\nJan. 8, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op) (citing Tex.R.App. P. 33.1(a); *792 Solis, 951 S.W.2d at 389; Ogden v. Ryals, No. 14–10–\n01052–CV, 2012 WL 3016856, at *4 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] July 24, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op)). PEI-the only party\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               15\n\fParham Family Ltd. Partnership v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\nagainst whom fees were assessed-made no objection to the jury charge on attorney's fees. Thus, we do not address this portion\nof its issue. See id.\n\nAs to the remainder of PEI's third issue, the judgment conditions the award of appellate attorney's fees on PEI's failure on appeal:\n\n             In the event of an appeal by the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. to the court of appeals, if the appeal\n             is unsuccessful, Plaintiff Diane Morgan will be further entitled to $25,000.00 as a reasonable attorney's\n             fee; in the event of an appeal by the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. to the Supreme Court of Texas, if\n             the appeal is unsuccessful, Plaintiff Diane Morgan will be further entitled to $15,000.00 as a reasonable\n             attorney's fee.\n\nSuch an award is tantamount to conditioning it on Diane's appellate success against PEI; for Diane to succeed on appeal, PEI\nmust fail on its issues.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we overrule PEI's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                            III. CONCLUSION\n\nIn sum, we have concluded that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case and that Diane had standing to bring\nher claims. We have accordingly overruled Partnership's and Van Jr.'s first and second issues. We have further determined that\nthe trial court properly granted Diane's partial summary judgment on all bases; thus we have overruled PEI's and Rhetta's first\nissue. Further, we have overruled PEI's and Rhetta's third issue regarding segregation of attorney's fees.\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion by enforcing the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction against PEI, and we lack\njurisdiction to consider that portion of PEI's and Rhetta's complaint regarding the trial court's contempt order. However, the\ntrial court did improperly include this temporary injunction in the final judgment, and we therefore have sustained in part PEI's\nsecond issue. We modify the trial court's judgment to remove the language concerning this temporary injunction from the final\njudgment. Finally, we have concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering a permanent anti-suit injunction\nagainst Partnership and Van Jr. We thus overruled the third and final issue of Partnership and Van Jr.\n\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment as modified.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      This certificate notes that a similarly named entity, Partnership, had been identified through the Secretary of State's record search.\n2      The parties variously spell this word as “intervenor” and “intervener.” For consistency's sake, we spell it “intervenor” throughout\n        this opinion, except where it has been quoted from the record.\n3       Our record does not contain a copy of the motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration filed by Partnership and Van Jr.\n4       The reporter's record from the pretrial conference reflects that Diane non-suited her claims against Rhetta for piercing the corporate\n        veil regarding responsibility for attorney's fees. According to the trial transcript, the only issue thus remaining was Diane's attorney's\n        fees against PEI.\n5       Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 65.011.\n6       See Golden Rule Ins. v. Harper, 925 S.W.2d 649, 651 (Tex.1996); Bridas Corp. v. Unocal Corp., 16 S.W.3d 887, 891 (Tex.App.-\n        Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. dism'd w.o.j.).\n7       U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Beuhler, 597 S.W.2d 523, 524 (Tex.Civ.App.-Beaumont 1980, no writ).\n8       The word “Final” was struck out by the trial court and the word “Interlocutory” was handwritten above it. Language of finality was\n        also struck from the end of the judgment.\n9       The trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law on October 4, 2012, after Partnership and Van Jr. filed a notice that such\n        findings and conclusions were past due and they had filed both a first and second request for them.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                         16\n\fParham Family Ltd. Partnership v. Morgan, 434 S.W.3d 774 (2014)\n\n\n10    At the time this suit was filed, the amount in controversy ceiling for statutory county courts was $100,000. However, this amount\n      was raised to $200,000 effective January 1, 2012. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1). Because Partnership and Van Jr. assert\n      that Diane's allegations exceed even the current amount, we will refer to the current enactment for ease of reference.\n11    Partnership and Van Jr. cite Eris v. Giannakopoulos, a case from our sister court, for the proposition that “[w]hen a suit is for an\n      interest in real property or to foreclose a lien on real property, rather than damages, the value of the property interest at issue determines\n      the amount in controversy.” 369 S.W.3d 618, 622 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.). In Giannakopoulos, the plaintiff did\n      not contain a statement of jurisdiction or otherwise identify the amount in controversy. Id. at 622. Here, Diane's petition did contain\n      a jurisdictional statement identifying an amount in controversy. Further, the plaintiff in Giannakopoulos brought suit to partition\n      three separate but adjacent and contiguous properties, of which he owned a fifty percent interest. Id. at 619. The trial court granted\n      a partition of the properties, dividing them into two equal-sized lots and awarding one to the plaintiff. Id. at 620. Diane, on the other\n      hand, sued to have a title declared void, for fraudulent transfer, and for damages. Nowhere in her pleadings does she seek to obtain\n      an interest in the property. Thus, the analysis in Giannakopoulos is inapplicable to the facts of this case.\n12    See infra section B.3 regarding the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Diane on her fraudulent transfer claim.\n13    As discussed above, Diane initially sued PEI and Rhetta, seeking to set aside the deed and for fraudulent transfer. Partnership and Van\n      Jr. then intervened in the lawsuit asserting their interest as the purported grantee of the subject property. Diane added claims against\n      them for conspiracy, but later nonsuited those claims. Their intervention was also struck on Diane's motion; they filed a motion for\n      reconsideration/new trial. A permanent anti-suit injunction was entered against them in the trial court's final judgment, the propriety\n      of which is addressed later in this opinion.\n14    Diane does not appear to have been confused about the order. As PEI and Rhetta point out, Diane did not attempt to try the fraudulent\n      transfer claim to the court or a jury. PEI and Rhetta characterize such failure as waiver. But Diane did not need to submit this claim\n      to the jury; the trial court had already granted her summary judgment on it.\n15    PEI and Rhetta also complain about the order of contempt, signed October 12, 2011, against them based on their violation of the\n      temporary injunction. However, we lack jurisdiction to address complaints about the contempt order. See Cadle Co. v. Lobingier,\n      50 S.W.3d 662, 671 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2001, pet. denied) (“Decisions in contempt proceedings cannot be reviewed on appeal\n      because contempt orders are not appealable, even when appealed along with a judgment that is appealable.”); see also In re B.A.C.,\n      144 S.W.3d 8, 10–12 (Tex.App.-Waco 2004, no pet.) (listing cases).\n16    We note that even if we were to declare the temporary injunction void, the contempt order based upon it is not reviewable by direct\n      appeal. See supra note 15.\n17    We note that Partnership and Van, Jr. have abandoned their claim in the trial court that they were necessary parties to the fraudulent\n      transfer action.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We hold that, while the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a\ntemporary injunction to preserve the status quo, it did abuse its discretion in crafting the temporary injunction order. We declare\nthe temporary injunction order void and dissolve the order because it is overly broad and fails to comply with Rule 683 of the\nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure. TEX.R. CIV.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n\n\n                                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nU.S. Money Reserve, Inc. d/b/a United States Rare Coin & Bullion Reserve (“U.S. Money Reserve”) filed suit against a group\nof former employees, including appellants, Chad Poole and Terry Fendley, alleging that appellants orchestrated a conspiracy\nto defraud U.S. Money Reserve and its customers. U.S. Money Reserve alleged specifically that defendants worked together\nto divert sales of coins from customers of U.S. Money Reserve and set up a scheme to abscond customer leads and divert\nsales to other defendant companies. The petition alleged that defendants received cash payments for diverting sales to the other\ncompanies. The petition sought among other remedies, a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and permanent\ninjunctive relief. The petition asserted that the acts of defendants constituted violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act as\nwell as a breach of the employment agreement signed by defendant-employees. U.S. Money Reserve further alleged tortious\ninterference with its business relationships and misappropriation of trade secrets.\n\n\nThe trial court entered a temporary injunction on February 22, 2008, preventing Poole and Fendley 1 from soliciting existing\nor potential clients of U.S. Money Reserve or otherwise engaging in any similar business in the United States through January\n25, 2011. The Temporary Injunction states in part that Poole and Fendley:\n\n\n  shall not call upon, solicit, divert, take away, and/or attempt to call upon, solicit, divert, or take away any existing or potential\n  clients, customers, suppliers, businesses, and/or accounts of U.S. Money Reserve, Inc. d/b/a United States Rare Coin &\n  Bullion Reserve (hereinafter referred to as “Company”) in connection with any business similar or related to the business in\n  the United States, nor will Defendant[s] ... interfere or compete with the Company in connection with such clients, customers,\n  suppliers, businesses, and accounts in the United States before 01/25/2011.\n  The Order further provides:\n\n     Defendant[s] ... shall not solicit the hiring of any present or future salesman or consultant of the Company before\n     01/25/2011.\n\n     Defendant[s] ... shall not engage in, or give any advice to any person, firm, partnership, associations, corporation, and/\n     or other entity engaged in a business similar to or related to the business of the Company or any portion thereof in the\n     United States before 01/25/2011.\n\n      *2 Defendant[s] ... shall not lend credit, money, or reputation for the purpose of establishing or operating a business\n     similar or related to the business of the Company or any portion thereof in the United States before 01/25/2011.\nFendley and Poole contend in three issues that the trial court abused it discretion 1) in reaching the implied finding that U.S.\nMoney Reserve had a probable right to the relief sought; 2) by entering a temporary injunction that was overbroad; and 3) in\nreaching the implied finding that U.S. Money Reserve would suffer a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury. Appellants\nargue in conjunction with their third issue that the trial court's order granting the temporary injunction is void because it fails\nto comply with Rule 683 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n                                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n“A temporary injunction is an extraordinary remedy and does not issue as a matter of right.” Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84\nS.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex.2002) (citing Walling v. Metcalfe, 863 S.W.2d 56, 57 (Tex.1993)). Its purpose is to preserve the status\nquo of the litigation's subject matter pending a trial on the merits. Wright v. Sport Supply Group, Inc., 137 S.W.3d 289, 292\n(Tex.App.-Beaumont 2004, no pet.) (citing Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204). “The decision to grant or deny a temporary injunction\nlies in the sound discretion of the trial court, and the court's grant or denial is subject to reversal only for a clear abuse of that\ndiscretion.” CRC–Evans Pipeline Int'l, Inc. v.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n\nLikewise, we review only the trial court's exercise of discretion in determining whether U.S. Money Reserve showed a\nprobability of success on the merits at trial and that it would suffer imminent, irreparable injury if the temporary injunction\nwere not granted. Tom James of Dallas, Inc. v. Cobb, 109 S.W.3d 877, 882–83 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2003, no pet.). “In making\nthat determination on appeal, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court, but determine only whether the court's\naction was so arbitrary as to exceed the bounds of reasonable discretion.” Id . at 883. “[W]e must view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the trial court's order, indulging every reasonable inference in its favor....” IAC, Ltd. v. Bell Helicopter\nTextron, Inc., 160 S.W.3d 191, 196 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2005, no pet.). “When the trial court bases its decision on conflicting\nevidence, there is no abuse of discretion.” Tom James, 109 S.W.3d at 883. A trial court\n\n             abuses its discretion when it misapplies the law to established facts or when the evidence does not\n             reasonably support the trial court's determination of the existence of probable injury or probable right of\n             recovery. We review de novo any determinations on questions of law the trial court made in support of\n             its order. However, we only review the trial court's decision on the issues before the court.\n\n *3 Id. (citations omitted). We recognize that the trial court's order is “based on the record presented at the temporary injunction\nhearing.” ,Id. at 885. “We will not assume that the evidence taken at a preliminary hearing will be the same as the evidence\ndeveloped at a full trial on the merits.” Id. Thus, our review of the trial court's order is limited to whether the trial judge abused\nits discretion in granting the temporary injunction on the record before it. Id.\n\n\n\n                                         PROBABLE RIGHT TO RELIEF SOUGHT\n\n“To obtain a temporary injunction, an applicant must plead and prove three specific elements (1) a cause of action against the\ndefendant; (2) a probable right to the relief sought; and (3) a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury before trial.” Wright,\n137 S.W.3d at 292. The first element is not disputed. Appellants contend that the trial court erred in impliedly finding that a\nprobable right to relief existed and in entering the temporary injunction. Specifically, appellants contend that the covenant not\nto compete is overbroad in that it contains an industry-wide exclusion preventing appellants from calling upon or soliciting any\nexisting or potential clients within the United States and prevents appellants from engaging in any business similar to or related\nto the business of U.S. Money Reserve throughout the United States.\n\n [1] An interlocutory appeal from “an order granting or denying a temporary injunction based on a convenant not to compete\ndoes not present for appellate review the ultimate question of whether the covenant is enforceable under section 15.50 of the\n[Texas] business and commerce code.” Tom James, 109 S.W.3d at 882–83 (citing TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 15.50\n(Vernon 2002)). We will only address the enforceability of those provisions insofar as it affects our analysis of whether the\nelements required for issuance of a temporary injunction have been satisfied. See id. at 883–85. The employment agreements\nwhich contain the covenants at issue in this lawsuit provide as follows:\n\n  15. Unauthorized Competition Prohibited. The Employee expressly agrees that the Employee shall not, for a period of\n  five (5) years after termination of the Association or employment between Employer and Employee, without prior written\n  consent of the Employer, directly or indirectly through any corporation, organization or entity owned or controlled by the\n  Employee, or as principal, agent, joint venture, employee, employer, consultant, partner, stock holder or holder of any equity\n  or security ..., in any other individual, representative or corporate capacity whatsoever:\n\n  a) Call upon, contact, solicit, divert, take away, or attempt to call upon, contact, solicit, divert or take away any existing or\n     potential clients, customers, suppliers, businesses, or accounts of the Employer in connection with any business similar\n     or related to the business within the above defined geographical area; nor will the Employee interfere with or compete\n     with the Employer in connection with such clients, customers, suppliers, businesses, and accounts in the geographical\n     area. The term client or customer as referenced in this covenant includes: (1) any clients or customers for whom\n     Employer provided services at any time during Employee's employment with Employer; and (2) any prospective clients\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n     or customers to whom Employer had submitted a proposal for services as of the effective date of Employee's termination\n     of employment with Employer.\n\n   *4 b) Solicit for hiring, or hire, any past, present or future employee, agent, representative or consultant of the Employer.\n\n  c) Engage in, or give any advice to any person, firm, partnership, associations, corporation, or other entity engaged in a\n     business similar to or related to the business of the Employer or any portion thereof in the geographical area.\n\n  d) Lend credit, money, or reputation for the purpose of establishing or operating a business similar to the business, or any\n     portion thereof, of the Employer in the geographical area.\n\n  e) Accept employment or pay from any person, firm, operation, partnership, association, or any other entity engaged\n     in a business similar to or related to the business of the Employer anywhere within the United States, United\n     Kingdom and Canada. This provision specifically includes existing competitors of the Employer, and any potential, future\n     competitors of Employer. This provision also specifically prohibits Employee from forming a competitive Employer or\n     organization as an owner, sole proprietor, partner, joint venturer (or in any other ownership capacity) competing against\n     Employer. Similarly, this provision specifically prohibits Employee from getting or giving any advice, knowledge or\n     information from or to any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity engaged in a business similar\n     to or related to the business of Employer or any portion thereof, within the United Kingdom, Canada or the United States.\n\n  f) It is expressly agreed, stipulated and understood by the Employee that the services of the Employer have been and are\n     currently being marketed and sold in the geographical area described above, and it is the Employer's intent to continue\n     to expand the marketability of its services and products. Accordingly, these covenants are intended to restrict the\n     Employee from competing in any manner with the Employer in the activities, which have heretofore been carried\n     on, by the Employee or any portion thereof or any activities similar or related thereto within the geographical area....\n\n(Emphasis added). 2 The geographical area is not specifically defined in the agreements of Poole and Fendley, however, at the\nhearing Poole and Dean Liepsner, C.E.O of U.S. Money Reserve, testified the geographic area encompassed the entire United\nStates. This is consistent with both the trial court's order and the terms of the restrictive covenants.\n\nAppellants contend that because the covenant contains an industry-wide exclusion it is overbroad and unenforceable and does\nnot give rise to a probable right to the relief sought. Appellants further contend that because the trial court's order implements\nthe industry-wide exclusion set forth in the restrictive covenants, it is likewise overbroad and unenforceable. While we do not\nundertake to consider the ultimate issue of whether the covenant is enforceable under current law, we hold, based on the facts\nestablished by the record, that the trial court abused its discretion in enjoining appellants from engaging in any subsequent\nemployment in that industry throughout the United States.\n\n *5 U.S. Money Reserve argues that this case is governed by Alex Sheshunoff Management Services, L.P. v. Johnson, 209\nS.W.3d 644 (Tex.2006), while appellants contend it is governed by Peat Marwick Main & Co. v. Haass, 818 S.W.2d 381\n(Tex.1991) and Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 289. The parties argued the enforceability of the covenants not to compete at the\ntemporary injunction hearing. “The enforceability of a covenant not to compete ... is a question of law for the court.” Light v.\nCentel Cellular Co. of Tex., 883 S.W.2d 642, 644 (Tex.1994). Our analysis merits a discussion of the cases cited by both parties.\n\nSection 15.50(a) of the Texas Business & Commerce Code provides that\n\n            a covenant not to compete is enforceable if it is ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement\n            at the time the agreement is made to the extent that it contains limitations as to time, geographical area,\n            and scope of activity to be restrained that are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is\n            necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n\nAdditionally, section 15.51(b) provides that “[i]f the primary purpose of the agreement to which the covenant is ancillary is\nto obligate the promisor to render personal services, for a term or at will, the promisee has the burden of establishing that the\ncovenant meets the criteria specified by Section 15.50....” Id. § 15.51(b) (Vernon 2002).\n\nIn Haass, the Texas Supreme Court held that “a damages provision affecting the right to render personal services operates as a\nrestraint of trade and must be judged by the reasonableness standards for covenants not to compete [.]” Haass, 818 S.W.2d at\n382. The underlying dispute in Haass began with the merger of two accounting firms, CJ and MH. Id. The Court recognized\nthat the relevant reasonableness questions with respect to the contractual provision at issue were whether the restraint imposed\nby the provision was greater than required to protect MH's legitimate interests and whether MH's need outweighed the hardship\nto Haass or the damage to the public. Id. at 386. The Court in Haass found significant that the contract provisions operated\nprospectively to include clients that became clients after the departing partner had already left the firm. Id. In addition, the\nprovision also expressly included any of MH's clients worldwide, not just those with whom Haass had some actual contact.\nId. The Court stated,\n\n  These aspects of the provision the court of appeals concluded were unreasonable because they were overbroad, oppressive\n  to Haass because he “would have to, in effect, take a prospective client's accounting history,” and injurious to the public by\n  limiting the choice of accountants.\n\n  The court of appeals' conclusion is supported by decisions from other jurisdictions. The fundamental legitimate business\n  interest that may be protected by such covenants is in preventing employees or departing partners from using the business\n  contacts and rapport established during the relationship of representing the accounting firm to take the firm's customers with\n  him.\n\n*6 Id. at 386–87 (citations omitted).\n\nThe Court concluded that in the context of the accounting firm merger at the center of dispute in Haass, the protectible\nfundamental business interest included preserving the client base that MH acquired by merging with CJ. Id. at 387. The Court\nrecognized that in order to meet the reasonableness standard there should be a “connection between the personal involvement\nof the former firm member with the client.” Id. The Court stated that “[i]nhibiting departing partners from engaging accounting\nservices for clients who were acquired after the partner left, or with whom the accountant had no contact while associated with\nthe firm, does not further and is not reasonably necessary to protect” the relevant business interest. Id. at 388. Therefore, the\nCourt held the provision was “overbroad and unreasonable.” Id. Notably, Haass was not a case involving a review of the trial\ncourt's grant of a temporary injunction; however, our decision in Wright was such a case. See Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 291.\n\nIn Wright, we considered whether the trial court abused its discretion in entering a temporary injunction to enforce a covenant,\nwhich like the restrictive covenant in the present case, contained an industry-wide exclusion, prohibiting the former employee\nfrom engaging in any sales activities in any related business across several counties. See id. Specifically, the agreement\nprohibited Wright, a former salesman for Sport Supply Group, Inc. (“SSG”) from, “either directly or indirectly, conducting\nany sales related activities for a business related to the promotion, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, sourcing, importing\nand/or sale of sports related equipment and/or supplies to institutional customers” in twenty-nine counties. Wright, 137 S.W.3d\nat 291, 298. The agreement further prohibited Wright from doing business with the “customers, suppliers, clients, licensors,\nlicensees, distributors, dealers, or independent salespersons of SSG, or any [of] its affiliates” that conducted business in Wright's\nsales district. Id. at 298.\n\nIn Wright we stated that “[a] restrictive covenant is unreasonable unless it bears some relation to the activities of the employee.”\nId. (citing Haass, 818 S.W.2d at 386–87). Additionally, we recognized that “[a] covenant not to compete that contains an\nindustry-wide exclusion from subsequent employment is unenforceable.” Id. (citing John R. Ray & Sons, Inc. v. Stroman, 923\nS.W.2d 80, 85 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied)). Further, we stated, “a covenant not to compete that extends\nto clients with whom a salesman had no dealings during his employment is unenforceable.” Id. We held the covenants at issue\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               6\n\fPoole v. U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\nwere unreasonable restraints of trade because they did not limit the prohibitions to customers with whom Wright had dealings\nwhile he was employed by SSG. Id. Consequently, we held that the trial court abused its discretion by granting the temporary\ninjunction. Id.\n\n *7 In Sheshunoff, the Texas Supreme Court addressed the enforceability of a restrictive covenant with no geographic restriction\nthat prohibited a former employee, Kenneth Johnson (“Johnson”) from providing consulting services to any former customers\nof his former employer, Alex Sheshunoff Management Services, L.P. (“ASM”), or from soliciting any affiliation member or\npreviously identified prospective client or affiliation member. Sheshunoff, 209 S.W.3d at 646–47. ASM provided consulting\nservices to banks and other financial institutions. Id. Johnson was the director of the company's “Affiliation Program,” a program\ndesigned to maintain relationships with clients and prospective clients. Id. A few months after being promoted to director of the\naffiliation program, Johnson signed an employment agreement, which he was told was a condition of his continued employment.\nId. The agreement provided in pertinent part:\n\n  (a) In consideration of the training and access to Confidential Information provided by Employer ... for a period of one (1)\n  year following the termination of Employee's employment for any reason, Employee will not\n\n  (i) directly or indirectly, as an owner, employee, independent contractor or otherwise, provide consulting services to banks,\n  savings and loans or other financial institutions where the Employee has provided fee based services in excess of 40 hours\n  within the last year of employment, or with which Employee has conducted significant sales activity, including, but not\n  limited to, more than one sales call, preparation of a sales proposal and actual sales, within the last year of employment.\n  This restriction applies regardless of geographic location, it being acknowledged by the parties that Employer's clients are\n  not confined to a particular geographic area;\n\n  (ii) solicit or aid any other party in soliciting any affiliation member or previously identified prospective client or affiliation\n  member; or\n\n  ....\n\n  (b) Employee understands and acknowledges that Employer has made substantial investments to develop its business interests\n  and goodwill, and to provide special training to Employee for the performance of Employee's duties under this Agreement.\n  Employee agrees that the limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained contained in this\n  Paragraph 6 are reasonable and are not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interests of Employer.\n\nId. at 656.\n\nASM brought an action to enforce the agreement after Johnson left and went to a competitor, Strunk & Associates, L.P.\n(“Strunk”). Id. at 647. Johnson argued that the covenant was overbroad because 1) its restriction on his solicitation of certain\nASM's prospective clients and “affiliation members” was unrelated to any training or confidential information he received; 2)\nASM's protection of its goodwill was unrelated to any such information; and 3) there was no basis for restricting Johnson from\ncalling on ASM's clients of whom he was aware before signing the agreement. Id. at 657. The Court disagreed noting that with\nJohnson's help, as director of affiliation, ASM continued to develop clients for four years after the agreement was signed. Id.\nIn addition, Johnson helped develop ASM's goodwill and could have tried to unfairly capitalize on it after going to Strunk. Id.\n\n *8 The Court found significant that Johnson was privy to ASM's development of an overdraft protection product, while Strunk\nwas the market leader for such products. Id. at 647, 657. The Court noted that the record established that the covenant would\nhave prevented Johnson from calling on 821 ASM clients for one year. Id. at 657. Finally, the Court took into consideration the\nfact that Johnson had admitted in his agreement that his covenant with ASM was reasonable 3 and had testified that “[w]hen\n[he] began work with Strunk, he agreed he would not sell an overdraft protection product ... to anyone in the industry ... for\ntwo years after leaving Strunk's employment,” which Johnson further testified was reasonable. Id. The Court concluded the\ncovenant in Johnson's agreement with ASM was reasonable. Id.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\nSheshunoff is distinguishable from the present case in that while ASM's restrictive covenant contained no geographic limitation,\nit only prevented Johnson from soliciting prior clients with whom he had personal contact or any “previously identified\nprospective client or affiliation member.” Id. at 647. Here, in addition to preventing Poole or Fendley from contacting existing\nand potential clients, the temporary injunction order prevents Poole and Fendley from engaging in any similar or related\nbusiness, in any capacity. Moreover, Johnson's job duties specifically involved client development and maintaining relationships\nwith prospective clients. Therefore, the restrictions in the covenant were directly related to Johnson's activities as an employee\nof the company. Like the defendant-employees in Haass and Wright, Poole and Fendley were salesmen. The law is well settled\nin Texas that “[i]n the case of covenants applied to a personal services occupation, such as that of a salesman, a restraint on\nclient solicitation is overbroad and unreasonable when it extends to clients with whom the employee had no dealings during his\n[or her] employment.” Stroman, 923 S.W.2d at 85 (citing Haass, 818 S.W.2d at 386–88; Daytona Group of Tex., Inc. v. Smith,\n800 S.W.2d 285, 288 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1990, writ denied)). As the Court stated in Haass, there should be a connection\nbetween the personal involvement of the former employee and the client. Haass, 818 S.W.2d at 387. The Court's subsequent\ndecision in Sheshunoff did not change the law in this regard. 4\n\nU.S. Money Reserve argues that the court's order is reasonable based on the express provisions of the covenant wherein\nthe employees acknowledged “that the limitations as to time, geographic area, and scope of activity to be restrained are\nreasonable....” The Court in Sheshunoff analyzed the reasonableness of a covenant which included virtually identical language.\nSheshunoff, 209 S.W.3d at 656. Notably, while the Court considered the language in making its determination, the language\nalone was not outcome determinative. See id. at 657. Likewise, this court addressed an agreement in Wright which contained\na provision that remedies at law for any breach or attempted breach of the agreement would be inadequate and waived as a\ndefense that either party had an adequate remedy at law. Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 293–94. We noted that we were unaware of\nany Texas case holding that such agreements, alone, were controlling on those issues; however, we recognized Texas's strong\npublic policy in favor of preserving freedom of contract. Id. at 294. We considered the language of the agreement together with\nother evidence established by the record, including testimony that SSG's damages would have been difficult to calculate. Id. at\n293–94. Following this approach, we conclude that the language of the agreement at issue here is but one consideration in our\nanalysis to be viewed in conjunction with the record in its entirety. See Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 293–94; see also Sheshunoff,\n209 S.W.3d at 657. 5\n\n *9 In addition to relying on the contract's express language, U.S. Money Reserve argues that the restraints found in the\ntemporary injunction are reasonable because of the nature of its business. U .S. Money Reserve asserts that the key to its success\nin the coin business is its marketing. It further argues that because of its tremendous investment and experience in marketing\nin the coin industry, it has learned which techniques are effective, and its salesman are provided with confidential information\nabout the company's marketing techniques, which would give them an unfair advantage in the national coin market if they were\nallowed to work for a competitor. Leipsner testified that in addition to the company's customer list, the marketing materials the\ncompany puts together are protected confidential information. Leipsner explained that the company discusses the marketing\nmaterials with its salesmen before the materials are distributed to the public. This is done so that the company's salesmen will\nbe adequately prepared to answer sales calls from the public following the company's advertising or media campaigns.\n\nNonetheless, it is undisputed that Poole and Fendley worked in sales. While marketing and advertising materials may have\nbeen reviewed or discussed with Poole or Fendley prior to public distribution, neither Poole nor Fendley were shown during\nthe hearing to have been hired to head up or develop the company's marketing efforts. Poole testified that he had “no idea”\nhow the company determined what to include in its advertising. Poole testified that his job responsibilities as a salesman were\nlimited to making sales calls and acting as a team leader for his sales team. Likewise, Poole testified that his job responsibilities\ndid not include determining which cities the ads would run in. While Leipsner testified that his salespeople were privy to “the\nrationale and the way that we put things together” in terms of marketing and advertising, he admitted that crafting this type of\ninformation was not part of Poole's or Fendley's job responsibilities.\n\nViewing the record in its entirety and in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, we hold that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in entering a temporary injunction order that was overbroad. 6 Therefore, we overrule issue one and sustain issue two.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See\nTEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 15.51(c); see also TEX.R.APP. P. 43.3. An exception to this rule exists where remand is\nnecessary for further proceedings. TEX.R.APP. P. 43.3(a); see also Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 299. Our determination of appellants'\nfinal issue requires that we dissolve the order granting the temporary injunction.\n\n\n\n                                                   IRREPARABLE INJURY\n\n [2] Appellants argue in issue three that the trial court abused its discretion in reaching the implied finding that U.S. Money\nReserve would suffer a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury. Specifically, appellants argue that there is an adequate legal\nremedy when damages for breach of contract are available thus, precluding injunctive relief. U.S. Money Reserve argues that\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in reaching the implied finding that U.S. Money Reserve would suffer a probable,\nimminent, and irreparable injury because 1) Poole testified that he does not believe that he or Fendley would have the money\nto pay a substantial judgment; 2) the damages suffered by U.S. Money Reserve are incapable of being measured by any certain\npecuniary standard—particularly, the damage to its relationship with its client-base; and 3) appellants contractually agreed that\nU.S. Money Reserve would suffer an irreparable injury if the restrictive covenants were breached and that damages would be\ndifficult, if not impossible, to calculate.\n\n *10 “An injury is irreparable if the injured party cannot be adequately compensated in damages or if the damages cannot be\nmeasured by any certain pecuniary standard.” Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204. Damages are inadequate, so as to support a temporary\ninjunction, if they are difficult to calculate. Rollins v. Universal Coin & Bullion Ltd., No. 09–06–150 CV, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS\n8764, at *13, 2006 WL 2883122 (Tex.App.-Beaumont Oct.12, 2006, no pet.) (mem.op.). Additionally, “[a]n abuse of discretion\ndoes not occur when [a] trial court bases its decision on conflicting evidence.” NMTC Corp. v. Conarroe, 99 S.W.3d 865, 868\n(Tex.App.-Beaumont 2003, no pet.). Here, Poole stipulated that he sold coins to customers on U.S. Money Reserve's customer\nlist after leaving the company. He also admitted that U.S. Money Reserve could no longer “take [him] at [his] word” when he\nsays he will not contact their customers.\n\nIn support of their argument that the trial court abused its discretion, appellants point out that Leipsner testified that U.S. Money\nReserve suffered a twenty percent decline in revenues since appellants left the company, as well as a five percent increase in\ngold orders returned to the company since appellants left. Based on this testimony, appellants argue that damages are capable\nof ready calculation. However, Leipsner also testified that he did not believe that damages could be calculated exactly. While\nLeipsner admitted placing a $250,000 liquidated damage value on aspects of appellants' conduct, he testified additionally that\nthe long-term effects of appellants conduct also needed to be taken into account. Moreover, while Poole testified that he may\nbe able to take out a loan to satisfy a judgment in the nature of $20,000, he also testified that he did not think he would be\nable to satisfy a judgment in the neighborhood of $50,000 and certainly not a judgment for $250,000. Poole testified that in his\nopinion Fendley would also not be able to satisfy such a judgment. 7\n\nU.S. Money Reserve points to the contract language, arguing that appellants expressly agreed in the employment agreement that\nU.S. Money Reserve would suffer an irreparable injury if the restrictive covenants contained within the contracts are breached.\nFurther, appellants expressly acknowledge in the contract that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate damages as a\nresult of a breach of the restrictive covenants. Considering the language in the contract in conjunction with the testimony in the\nrecord, we cannot say the trial court erred in making the implied finding that U.S. Money Reserve, prior to trial, would suffer\na probable imminent and irreparable injury. Issue three is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                              COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 683\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n [3] In conjunction with their final issue, Appellants argue that the order granting the temporary injunction is void under Rule\n683 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. U.S. Money Reserve argues that appellants have waived any right to raise that issue\non appeal. Rule 683 provides in pertinent part:\n\n   *11 Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be\n  specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or\n  acts sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees,\n  and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order\n  by personal service or otherwise.\n\n  Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits with respect to\n  the ultimate relief sought.\n\nTEX.R. CIV. P. 683. We recognized in International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 479 v. Becon Construction\nCo. Inc., 104 S.W.3d 239, 244 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2003, no pet.), that “[t]he reasons given by the trial court for granting a\ntemporary injunction must be specific and legally sufficient, and not mere conclusory statements.” We stated,\n\n            [B]ecause probable injury subsumes the elements of irreparable injury and no adequate remedy at law,\n            a valid injunction must articulate the reasons why the identified probable injury is an irreparable one for\n            which [applicants] have no adequate legal remedy. Consequently, the specificity required by Rule 683\n            is not satisfied by the mere recital of no adequate remedy at law and irreparable harm.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded that “ ‘[t]he failure to include in the order a reason why\nthe court deems issuance of the writ proper for preventing injury to the applicant is reversible error.’ ” Id. (quoting Stoner v.\nThompson, 553 S.W.2d 150, 151 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.)).\n\nIn Int'l Brotherhood, we addressed the issue of whether the requirements of Rule 683 could be waived. Id. at 243. We recognized\nthat in InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Construction Co., the Texas Supreme Court held that the requirements of Rule\n683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed. Id. (citing InterFirst, 715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.1986)). “[W]hen an order\nof temporary injunction fails to adhere to these requirements it is subject to being declared void and dissolved.” Id. In Int'l\nBrotherhood we rejected the argument that appellants waived any issues concerning failure to comply with Rule 683 and held,\nin line with the great weight of authority following InterFirst, that a defective order granting a temporary injunction could not\nbe validated by means of waiver. Id.\n\nHere, U.S. Money Reserve argues that appellants waived the right to raise this issue on appeal not only because they failed to\nraise it in the trial court, but also because appellants agreed to the court's judgment, wherein the phrase “Agreed as to Form\nOnly” prefaced appellants' counsel's signature. The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently addressed this very issue. See In re\nGarza, 126 S.W.3d 268 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding [mand. denied] ).\n\n *12 In Garza, appellant argued that because “the temporary injunction failed to (1) set a trial setting pursuant to Texas Rule of\nCivil Procedure 683 and (2) set bond pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 684, the temporary injunction [was] void.” Id.\nat 270. In response, appellee argued that Garza “waived her complaint by agreeing to the terms of the temporary injunction.” Id.\nSpecifically, the temporary injunction stated that the parties agreed to the terms of the order as evidenced by their signatures,\nwhich were prefaced by the phrase “Approved as to Form Only.” Id. Appellee argued that appellant was barred from complaining\nabout the order on appeal relying on case law stating that “a party may not appeal from or attack a judgment to which he has\nagreed, absent allegation and proof of fraud, collusion, or misrepresentation.” Id. (citing Henke v. Peoples State Bank, 6 S.W.3d\n717, 720 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.)).\n\nThe court in Garza recognized that “[a] void order has no force or effect and confers no rights; it is a mere nullity.” Id. at 271\n(citing Slaughter v. Qualls, 139 Tex. 340, 345, 162 S.W.2d 671, 674 (1942)). Thus, the court concluded, “a party who agrees\nto a void order has agreed to nothing.” Id. The court then undertook to determine whether the trial court's order granting the\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\ntemporary injunction was “void” or merely “voidable .” Id. The court recognized that the Texas Supreme Court spoke to this\nissue in Qwest Communications Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334 (Tex.2000) (per curiam).\n\nIn Qwest appellants argued that the trial court's order was not a temporary injunction because it failed to set the case for trial\non the merits or set a bond as required by Rules 683 and 684 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Quest, 24 S.W.3d at 337\n(citing TEX.R. CIV. P. 683, 684). The Court disagreed stating,\n\n             These procedural requirements are mandatory, and an order granting a temporary injunction that does\n             not meet them is subject to being declared void and dissolved. In InterFirst Bank, however, the order\n             failed to set the case for trial on the merits. Yet rather than dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction,\n             we declared the temporary injunction void and ordered it dissolved. We have also held that a temporary\n             injunction was void when there was no bond. Here, these procedural requirements may render the trial\n             court's order void but they do not change the order's character and function defining its classification.\n\nId. (citations omitted). Based on this language, the court of appeals in Garza concluded that unless a temporary injunction\ncomplies with Rules 683 and 684, it is void. Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273; see also Int'l Brotherhood, 104 S.W.3d at 244. Based\non the Court's holding in Qwest, the court in Garza held that the temporary injunction, which failed to comply with Rules 683\nand 684, was void even though the parties expressly agreed to the temporary injunction order. Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273. The\nTexas Supreme Court recently clarified its holding in Interfirst stating “[o]rders that fail to fulfill [the] requirements [of Rule\n683] are void.” In re Office of the Attorney General, 257 S.W.3d 695, 697 (Tex.2008) (per curiam).\n\n *13 The trial court's order granting the temporary injunction in favor of U.S. Money Reserve does not set forth any reasons\nfor issuance of the temporary injunction or otherwise state any reason why the identified probable injury is an irreparable one\nfor which U.S. Money Reserve has no legal remedy. Further, the order does not include a date setting the matter for trial as\nrequired by Rule 683. TEX.R. CIV. P. 683. Instead, the order attempts to enjoin the parties through a date certain in the future,\nJanuary 25, 2011. The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo through the date of trial. See Butnaru,\n84 S.W.3d at 204.\n\nWhile the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a temporary injunction to maintain the status quo, it did abuse its\ndiscretion in entering the temporary injunction order as crafted. We hold that the temporary injunction order is void as it is\noverly broad and fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 683. TEX.R. CIV. P. 683. We dissolve the temporary injunction.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      We note that the court's order appears to have erroneously misspelled Terry Fendley's name as “Terry Finley.”\n2      We note that while appellants argue that the trial court's order follows the language of the restrictive covenants in their employment\n        agreements verbatim, this is not the case. The language in Poole's and Fendley's agreements differed from the language in some\n        of the older employment agreements, which appear to have been inadvertently referenced by appellants in their brief. A significant\n        difference in the agreements at issue and the agreement referenced is that the term “clients” is defined in the agreements of Poole and\n        Fendley as set forth above. Likewise, the agreement set forth above is the agreement that Poole authenticated and testified to during\n        the hearing. While existing and potential customers and clients are defined in these employment agreements, the trial court's order\n        granting the temporary injunction made no attempt whatsoever to define “existing or potential clients or customers.”\n3       See Sheshunoff, 209 S.W.3d at 656.\n4       We note that Texas decisions analyzing the reasonableness of time, geography, and scope of activities restricted in covenants not\n        to compete are fact-specific and those decisions vary depending largely on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The nature of the employer's business and the job responsibilities and involvement of the subject employee are usually taken\n      into account. For example, we note that other courts have found nation-wide exclusions reasonable where the covenant accompanied\n      the sale of a business and was enforced against its prior owner. See Vais Arms, Inc. v. Vais, 383 F.3d 287, 295–96 n. 20 (5th Cir.2004)\n      (citing Williams v. Powell Elec. Mfg. Co., 508 S.W.2d 665, 668 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1974, no writ) (nationwide\n      injunction not an abuse of discretion where business sold was national in character)) (geographic scope of noncompete agreement was\n      reasonable and enforceable against prior business owner where business owner had advertised his product in nationally-distributed\n      trade publications, mail order catalogues, and the internet). In those cases, the individual restricted by the covenant had a more\n      unique and specialized knowledge of the business and the business interests at issue. See also Curtis v. Ziff Energy Group, Ltd., 12\n      S.W.3d 114, 118–19 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.) (restrictive covenant upheld against the former Vice President\n      of Pipelines and Energy Marketing, which prevented him from working for any similar company in North America for a period of\n      six months, where former Vice President was hired to “head up and build up the U.S. practice in the areas of consulting regarding\n      pipeline/transportation issues, and energy marketing).\n5     We note that this analysis is in line with the analysis employed by courts in other jurisdictions when analyzing covenants containing\n      similar acknowledgments.

Counsel stated,\n            Now, the only area that this thing would possibly need to be reformed on is something we're willing to stipulate for the Court. It\n            does have a nationwide, industrywide exclusion and to start off we're willing to tell the Court that we are willing to reform that\n            to make it no competition if they are located in the state of Texas or any of the surrounding states with the state of Texas.\n            Therefore, if they want to sell coins in the state of Kentucky or the state of Georgia or Alaska or on the West Coast, we feel\n            that's fine....\n         Counsel additionally stated: “What I'm saying is that an industrywide, nationwide exclusion has been held unreasonable; .... [s]o,\n         what I'm suggesting is, ... the trial court merely has to make a decision on the trial court's own as to the scope of the geographic\n         restriction.” Appellant-employees, on the other hand, argued that the covenant needed to be reformed to prevent the employees from\n         soliciting clients with whom they had contact while working for U.S. Money Reserve or who were clients of the company. In fact,\n         there is evidence in the record that Poole agreed to enter into an injunction prohibiting him from contacting U .S. Money Reserve\n         clients. The trial court refrained from reforming the covenant prior to hearing testimony and allowed the parties to move forward.\n7     While there is evidence in the record that Fendley was subpoenaed, he failed to appear at the injunction hearing.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 600\n\n\nOpinion\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\nThe single issue in this petition is whether the trial court's interlocutory order is a temporary injunction and thus appealable under\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.014(a)(4). The court of appeals held that the order was not an appealable\ntemporary injunction and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. 983 S.W.2d 885. Because we hold that the trial court's\norder grants a temporary injunction, we grant the petition and remand the case to the court of appeals to consider the merits\nof the appeal.\n\nIn 1997, AT & T Corporation and AT & T Communications of the Southwest, Inc. (collectively “AT & T”) sued Qwest\nCommunications Corporation, Qwest Communications International, Inc. (collectively “Qwest”), and others for damages to\nAT & T's fiber optic cables. In addition, AT & T sought a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, and a permanent\ninjunction. On the same day that the petition was filed, the trial court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order.\n\nAt the temporary injunction hearing, the parties informed the trial court that they had resolved the matters set for the temporary\ninjunction hearing, and then read the agreement into the record. Among other restrictions applicable to all activities within the\nUnited States, the agreement required Qwest to notify AT & T of any construction operations within thirty feet of an AT & T\nunderground facility, and to electronically monitor the location of the drill borehead used during boring and pullback operations.\nFurther, the agreement dissolved the previous temporary restraining order bond, left open any claims for damages, and expired\nthree years from the date it became effective unless extended or modified in a signed writing by the parties. At the conclusion of\nthis hearing, the judge stated that “[w]ith respect to the plaintiff's application for temporary injunction, judgment is rendered”\nand told counsel for AT & T to prepare a written order, deliver it to Qwest's counsel for comment, and then submit it to the trial\ncourt. Ultimately, the parties could not agree to the terms of the written order to be submitted to the trial court. The trial court,\nafter a “clarification” hearing, signed an order following the terms recited into the record at the temporary injunction hearing.\n\nQwest appealed. But the court of appeals dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction, holding that the order did not grant a\ntemporary injunction. The court concluded that the order did not meet the “traditional requirements” of a temporary injunction\nbecause the order did not preserve the status quo, require a bond, set a trial date, require the clerk to issue a writ of injunction,\nnor was the order's duration limited until final judgment or further order of the court. 983 S.W.2d at 888. Qwest then petitioned\nthis Court for review.\n\n [1]    [2] This Court has jurisdiction to determine whether a court of appeals correctly decided its jurisdiction over an\ninterlocutory *336 appeal. See Lesikar v. Rappeport, 899 S.W.2d 654, 655 (Tex.1995) (determining whether interlocutory\norder being appealed was temporary injunction). An appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order unless a\nstatute specifically authorizes an exception to the general rule, which is that appeals may only be taken from final judgments.\nSee Stary v. DeBord, 967 S.W.2d 352, 352–53 (Tex.1998); Jack B. Anglin Co., Inc. v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d 266, 272 (Tex.1992).\nIn this case, Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.014(a) states: “[a] person may appeal from an interlocutory\norder of a district court, county court at law, or county court that: ... (4) grants or refuses a temporary injunction....” TEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM.CODE § 51.014(a)(4).\n\n [3] [4] [5] An injunction is a remedial writ that depends on the issuing court's equity jurisdiction. See State v. Morales,\n869 S.W.2d 941, 947 (Tex.1994). One function of injunctive relief is to restrain motion and to enforce inaction. See Boston v.\nGarrison, 152 Tex. 253, 256 S.W.2d 67, 70 (1953). The trial court's order here commands Qwest to undertake certain monitoring\nand notice provisions when conducting certain boring operations. Thus, the order is an injunction.\n\nAT & T argues, however, that the order cannot be a temporary injunction because it lacks the defining characteristics of a\ntemporary injunction. First, it contends that the order goes beyond what is necessary to preserve the status quo because it applies\nto all of Qwest's operations in the United States. Second, AT & T asserts that one of the hallmarks of a temporary injunction is\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                3\n\fQwest Communications Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334 (2000)\n43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 600\n\nthat it is effective for an indefinite period, operating only until dissolved by another interlocutory order or until final hearing.\nHere, the order governs Qwest's conduct for a period of three years, until December 2000, a period well beyond the original\nscheduled trial date of July 6, 1998. Finally, AT & T notes that the order did not set a bond or trial date and did not order\nissuance of a writ of injunction.\n\nThe order's features that AT & T identifies do not necessarily control the classification of this order as a temporary injunction. In\nDel Valle Independent School District v. Lopez, we rejected the notion that “matters of form control the nature of the order itself\n—it is the character and function of an order that determine its classification.” 845 S.W.2d 808, 809 (Tex.1992). We reasoned\nthat if errors in the form of the order determined the order's status, then those errors would deny review of the very defects that\nrender the order void. See Del Valle, 845 S.W.2d at 809–10; Brines v. McIlhaney, 596 S.W.2d 519, 523 (Tex.1980).\n\nHere, AT & T requested and received a court order restricting Qwest's conduct. The order recites that it is effective for a set\nthree-year period from the date it was rendered unless it is extended or modified in writing signed by the parties. AT & T notes\nthat this Court has previously stated that a temporary injunction “operates until dissolved by an interlocutory order or until the\nfinal hearing.” Brines, 596 S.W.2d at 523; see also J.C. Matlock v. Data Processing Sec., Inc., 618 S.W.2d 327, 328 (Tex.1981)\n(stating the purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending trial on the merits). Thus, we must decide\nwhether the fixed three-year term precludes the order's classification as a temporary injunction.\n\nSome courts of appeals' opinions have held an order was a temporary injunction even when it granted the maximum duration of\nrelief to which the plaintiff would be entitled at a trial on the merits. See Glenn Advertising, Inc. v. Black, 454 S.W.2d 841, 844\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14 th Dist.] 1970, writ ref'd n.r.e.). In Glenn Advertising, the court of appeals noted that the order\nshould correctly provide that the temporary injunction should remain in effect only until final hearing or until further order of\nthe court. Id. Yet, the court did not dismiss the appeal for *337 want of jurisdiction, but instead simply modified the order\nto remain in full force and effect until final judgment was entered. Other courts of appeals have followed this reasoning and\nexercised jurisdiction over appeals from orders that were not made effective until final judgment or further action by the trial\ncourt. See Hailey v. Texas–New Mexico Power Co., 757 S.W.2d 833, 835 (Tex.App.—Waco 1988, writ dism'd w.o.j.); Owens\nv. Texaco Inc., 368 S.W.2d 780, 783 (Tex.Civ.App.—Beaumont 1963, no writ).\n\nBut other courts of appeals have held that when an injunction is effective for a fixed period of time it is a permanent rather than\na temporary injunction. See Aloe Vera of America, Inc. v. CIC Cosmetics Int'l Corp., 517 S.W.2d 433, 436 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nDallas 1974, no writ). In Aloe Vera, the trial court signed an order styled “Permanent Injunction” and directed the clerk to issue\na “Writ of Injunction permanently enjoining until January 1, 1975.” The court of appeals held that limiting the restraint to the\nperiod ending January 1, 1975, precluded the order from being a temporary injunction. “Whether the restraint continues for six\nmonths or six years has no bearing on the question of permanency. No more permanent order could be made with respect to\nthis particular claim for injunctive relief.” Id. at 436. The court therefore held that the order was an interlocutory permanent\ninjunction rather than a temporary injunction and thus was not appealable. See id. Other courts of appeals have adopted the\nreasoning of Aloe Vera. See James v. Hubbard, 985 S.W.2d 516, 518 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1998, no writ); Brelsford v.\nOld Bridge Lake Community Service Corp., 784 S.W.2d 700, 702 (Tex.App.—Houston [14 th Dist.] 1989, no writ); Kelso v.\nThorne, 710 S.W.2d 735, 736 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1986, no writ); Zoning Bd. of Adjustment v. Graham, 664 S.W.2d\n430, 434 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1983, no writ); Gensco, Inc. v. Thomas, 609 S.W.2d 650, 651 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio\n1980, no writ).\n\n [6] The approach taken by Aloe Vera and the line of cases that follow it is problematic in that a burdensome interlocutory\norder that has the same effect as a temporary injunction could be shielded from appellate review by the very defect that makes\nit erroneous. See Del Valle, 845 S.W.2d at 809–10. Whether an injunction is effective for a fixed period of time or is made\neffective only until further order of the court or final judgment is only one of the factors in determining the character and nature\nof the order. Because the trial court's order places restrictions on Qwest and is made effective immediately so that it operates\nduring the pendency of the suit, it functions as a temporary injunction.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 600\n\n [7] [8] Finally, AT & T argues that the order is not a temporary injunction because it does not set the case for trial on the\nmerits or set a bond. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require that an order granting a temporary injunction set the cause for\ntrial on the merits and fix the amount of security to be given by the applicant. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 683, 684. These procedural\nrequirements are mandatory, and an order granting a temporary injunction that does not meet them is subject to being declared\nvoid and dissolved. See InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr. Co., 715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.1986) (stating that\nrequirements of Rule 683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed). In InterFirst Bank, however, the order failed to set the\ncase for trial on the merits. Id. at 641. Yet rather than dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction, we declared the temporary\ninjunction void and ordered it dissolved. See id. We have also held that a temporary injunction was void when there was no\nbond. See Lancaster v. Lancaster, 155 Tex. 528, 291 S.W.2d 303, 308 (1956) (holding that bond provisions of Rule 684 are\nmandatory). Here, these procedural requirements may render the trial court's order void but they do not change the order's\ncharacter and function defining its classification.\n\n *338 We hold that, in character and function, the trial court's order grants a temporary injunction and is appealable under\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.014(a)(4). We do not express any opinion, however, on the merits of the\nappeal. Accordingly, the Court grants petitioner's petition for review and, without hearing oral argument, reverses the judgment\nof the court of appeals and remands the case to that court for consideration of the merits of the appeal.

J. 900\n\nreceive timely notice enabling them to answer and defend the claim, the case should not be dismissed. Because the court of\nappeals concluded otherwise, we reverse its judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n\nI. Background\nFormer Chief Deputy Constable Larry Roccaforte sued Jefferson County and Constable Jeff Greenway, alleging that his\nwrongful termination deprived him of rights guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. Roccaforte personally served County Judge\nCarl Griffith with the suit, and fifteen days later, the County (represented by the district attorney) and Constable Greenway\nanswered, denying liability. The County propounded written discovery requests, deposed Roccaforte, and presented County\nofficials for depositions. The County also filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that Roccaforte did not give requisite notice\nof the suit. See TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODEE § 89.0041. Roccaforte disagreed, arguing that the statute applied only to contract\nclaims. Alternatively, he argued that 42 U.S.C. § 1983 preempted the notice requirements and that he substantially complied\nwith them in any event.\n\nAlthough the trial court indicated that it would sustain the County's plea and sever those claims from the underlying case, it\ndid not immediately sign an order doing so. In the meantime, Roccaforte tried his claims against Greenway. A jury returned a\nverdict in Roccaforte's favor. Afterwards, the trial court signed an order granting the County's jurisdictional plea. The order did\nnot sever the claims from the underlying case. Roccaforte then pursued this interlocutory appeal. His notice of appeal stated\nthat “[p]ursuant to Civ. P. Rem.Code § 51.014(b), all proceedings are *921 stayed in the trial court pending resolution of the\nappeal.” But the proceedings were not stayed.\n\nIn the underlying case, Greenway moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court granted as to\nRoccaforte's property interest and First Amendment retaliation claims but denied as to Roccaforte's claimed violation of his\nliberty interest. Roccaforte moved for entry of judgment. Notwithstanding the statutory stay referenced in Roccaforte's notice\nof appeal, the trial court rendered judgment for Roccaforte and awarded damages, attorney's fees, and costs. The judgment\nwas titled “FINAL JUDGMENT”; it “denie[d] all relief no [sic] granted in this judgment”; and it stated “[t]his is a FINAL\nJUDGMENT.” The County was included in the case caption. No one objected to the continuation of trial court proceedings\ndespite the statutory stay.\n\nGreenway appealed, and Roccaforte cross-appealed, raising as his only issues complaints regarding the trial court's JNOV on\nhis claims against Greenway. The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, rendering judgment that Roccaforte\ntake nothing. Greenway v. Roccaforte, 2009 WL 3460683, at *6, 2009 Tex.App. LEXIS 8290, at *15 (Tex.App.-Beaumont\n2009, pet. denied). 1\n\nIn Roccaforte's separate interlocutory appeal, the court of appeals made the following notation:\n\n             Roccaforte notes that immediately after the dismissal order, the trial of the case proceeded to judgment\n             without the County as a party. No one disputes that all the claims against all other parties have been\n             resolved. The order of dismissal is therefore appealable whether or not the statute at issue is jurisdictional.\n\n281 S.W.3d 230, 231 n. 1. The court ultimately concluded that Roccaforte's failure to notify the County of the suit by registered\nor certified mail mandated dismissal of his suit against the County, but not because the trial court lacked jurisdiction. Id. at\n236–37. Accordingly, the court modified the dismissal order to reflect that dismissal was without prejudice and affirmed the\norder as modified. Id.\n\n\nRoccaforte petitioned this Court for review, which we granted. 2 53 Tex.Sup.Ct.J. 1061 (Aug. 27, 2010).\n\n\nII. Did the trial court's final judgment moot this interlocutory appeal?\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 900\n\nBefore turning to the merits, we must decide a procedural matter: What happens when a party perfects an appeal of an\ninterlocutory judgment that has not been severed from the underlying action, and that action proceeds to trial and a final\njudgment? The trial court did not sever Roccaforte's claims against the County 3 and denied “all relief not granted” in its final\njudgment. Ordinarily, under these circumstances, Roccaforte would have to complain on appeal that the trial court erroneously\ndismissed those claims. Roccaforte, however, did not complain about the County's dismissal in his appeal from the final\njudgment. His separate interlocutory appeal, then, rests on a precipice of mootness.\n\n\n*922 A. Roccaforte waived any complaint about the trial court's actions during the statutory stay.\nAlthough Roccaforte's interlocutory appeal was supposed to stay all proceedings in the trial court pending resolution of the\nappeal, 4 Roccaforte did not object to the trial court's rendition of judgment while the stay was in effect. To the contrary, he\naffirmatively moved for entry of judgment. Because a final judgment frequently moots an interlocutory appeal, 5 we must\ndecide whether the trial court's failure to observe the stay made the final judgment void or merely voidable. If the final judgment\nis void, it would have no impact on this interlocutory appeal. Lindsay v. Jaffray, 55 Tex. 626 (Tex.1881) (“A void judgment\nis in legal effect no judgment.”) (quoting FREEMAN ON JUDGMENTS, § 117). 6 If voidable, then we must decide whether\nit moots this proceeding. See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d 860, 863 (Tex.2010) (observing that voidable orders\nmust be corrected by direct attack and, unless successfully attacked, become final). We conclude it is voidable.\n\nTwo of our courts of appeals have held that the failure to object when a trial court proceeds despite the automatic stay waives any\nerror the trial court may have committed by failing to impose it. See Escalante v. Rowan, 251 S.W.3d 720, 724–25 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2008), rev'd on other grounds, 332 S.W.3d 365 (Tex.2011) (per curiam); Henry v. Flintrock Feeders, Ltd.,\nNo. 07–04–0224–CV, 2005 WL 1320121, at *1, 2005 Tex.App. LEXIS 4310, at *1 (Tex.App.-Amarillo June 1, 2005, no pet.)\n(mem.op.). In Escalante, the court of appeals held that a party's failure to object to a trial court's ruling on summary judgment\nmotions during the statutory stay “failed to preserve error as to any objection that the summary judgment is voidable based on\nthe stay.” Escalante, 251 S.W.3d at 725. In Henry, the court held that a party's failure to object to the trial court's action in\nviolation of the stay waived any error resulting from that action. Henry, 2005 WL 1320121, at *1–2, 2005 Tex.App. LEXIS\n4310, at *4 (holding that trial court's grant of summary judgment mooted interlocutory appeal challenging denial of special\nappearance). We find particularly instructive a case involving a trial court's rendition of final judgment while an interlocutory\nappeal of a class certification order was pending:\n\n             [I]f a trial court proceeds to trial during the interlocutory appeal, the class action plaintiff must inform\n             the court of section 51.014(b) and request that the stay be enforced. If a court proceeds to trial over the\n             objection of a class action plaintiff, the class action plaintiff could request a mandamus and this court\n             would grant it. However, if the class action plaintiff fails to inform the trial court of section 51.014(b),\n             and allows the court to proceed to trial, as happened here, the *923 plaintiff waives the right to object\n             or request any relief on appeal. See TEX.R.APP. P. 33.1(a). We see this as no different from any other\n             trial court error that is not preserved—it is waived.\n\nSiebenmorgen v. Hertz Corp., No. 14–97–01012–CV, 1999 WL 21299, at *3, 1999 Tex.App. LEXIS 311, at *10–11 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] Jan. 21, 1999, no pet.) (dismissing as moot interlocutory appeal of order denying class certification).\n\nA third court of appeals has implicitly concluded that parties can waive the right to insist on a section 51.014(b) stay. See Lincoln\nProperty Co. v. Kondos, 110 S.W.3d 712, 715 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2003, no pet.). In that case, the court observed that the trial\ncourt's grant of summary judgment while an interlocutory appeal was pending violated the statutory stay. Noting that “neither\nparty requested a stay from this Court” and “both parties sought to commence the ‘trial’ below by filing and/or arguing motions\nfor summary judgment while this appeal was pending,” the court of appeals did not conclude that the trial court's summary\njudgment was void. Id. at 715. Instead, the appellate court held that the summary judgment mooted the interlocutory appeal.\nId. at 715–16 (noting that the interlocutory class certification order merged into the final judgment). The court concluded: “By\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               4\n\fRoccaforte v. Jefferson County, 341 S.W.3d 919 (2011)\n32 IER Cases 346, 54 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 900\n\nrendering a final judgment during this appeal, the trial court also rendered itself powerless to reconsider its class certification\nruling were we to conclude here the ruling was entered in error.” Id. at 715.\n\nWe agree with those decisions that have held that a party may waive complaints about a trial court's actions in violation of the\nstay imposed by section 51.014(b). That stay differs from a situation in which the relevant statute vests “exclusive jurisdiction”\nin a particular forum. See, e.g., Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U.S. 433, 439, 60 S.Ct. 343, 84 L.Ed. 370 (1940) (noting that bankruptcy\nlaw in effect at the time “vested in the bankruptcy courts exclusive jurisdiction” and “withdr[ew] from all other courts all power\nunder any circumstances”). For that reason, we have held that actions taken in violation of a bankruptcy stay are void, not just\nvoidable. Cont'l Casing Corp. v. Samedan Oil Corp., 751 S.W.2d 499, 501 (Tex.1988). 7\n\n [1] But as we have noted, “a court's action contrary to a statute or statutory equivalent means the action is erroneous or\n‘voidable,’ not that the ordinary appellate or other direct procedures to correct it may be circumvented.” Mapco, Inc. v. Forrest,\n795 S.W.2d 700, 703 (Tex.1990); cf. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Loutzenhiser, 140 S.W.3d 351, 359 (Tex.2004) (noting that\nfailure to comply with a non-jurisdictional statutory requirement may result in the loss of a claim, but that failure must be timely\nasserted and compliance can be waived). That is the case here. The trial court's rendition of final judgment while the stay was in\neffect was voidable, not void, and Roccaforte's failure to object to the trial court's actions waived any error related to the stay.\nWe must, therefore, confront the fact that the trial *924 court signed a final judgment disposing of all parties and all claims\nand that Roccaforte did not present in his appeal from that judgment the arguments he advances in this interlocutory appeal.\n\n\nB. The trial court's final judgment implicitly modified its interlocutory order, and we treat this appeal as relating to\nthat final judgment.\n [2] We have repeatedly held that the right of appeal should not be lost due to procedural technicalities. 8 Roccaforte timely\nperfected appeals from both the interlocutory order and the final judgment, and this is not a situation in which further proceedings\nmooted the issues raised in Roccaforte's interlocutory appeal. 9\n\n[3]   Our procedural rules provide that:\n\n            After an order or judgment in a civil case has been appealed, if the trial court modifies the order or\n            judgment, or if the trial court vacates the order or judgment and replaces it with another appealable\n            order or judgment, the appellate court must treat the appeal as from the subsequent order or judgment\n            and may treat actions relating to the appeal of the first order or judgment as relating to the appeal of\n            the subsequent order or judgment. The subsequent order or judgment and actions relating to it may be\n            included in the original or supplemental record. Any party may nonetheless appeal from the subsequent\n            order or judgment.\n\nTEX.R.APP. P. 27.3. Here, although the trial court's final judgment did not expressly modify its interlocutory order, it did\nso implicitly. Because the claims against the County had not been severed, the County remained a party to the underlying\nproceeding despite the interlocutory appeal. The final judgment necessarily replaced the interlocutory order, which merged into\nthe judgment, 10 even though Roccaforte's interlocutory appeal remained pending. Under our rules, however, we may treat this\ninterlocutory appeal as an *925 appeal from the final judgment. That permits us to reach the merits of Roccaforte's claims\nrather than dismiss the interlocutory appeal as moot.\n\nAlthough not relying on rule 27.3, the court of appeals took a similar approach, treating Roccaforte's appeal as though it were\nfrom the final judgment. 281 S.W.3d at 231 n. 1. Similarly, we treat Roccaforte's appellate complaints about the trial court's\ngrant of the County's jurisdictional plea as though they related to the appeal of the final judgment.

LOC. GOV'T CODEE § 89.0041. In 2005, the Legislature amended the Government Code to provide that “[s]tatutory\nprerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are jurisdictional requirements in all suits against a governmental\nentity.” TEX. GOV'T CODE § 311.034.\n\nThe County contends section 311.034 makes Roccaforte's failure to comply with section 89.0041's notice requirements\njurisdictional—an issue we have never decided. Our courts of appeals, however, have concluded that the notice requirements\nare not jurisdictional, even in light of section 311.034. See El Paso Cnty. v. Alvarado, 290 S.W.3d 895, 898–99 (Tex.App.-El\nPaso 2009, no pet.) (holding that section 89.0041 is not jurisdictional because section 311.034 applies only to prerequisites to\nfile suit, not post-suit notice requirements); Ballesteros v.

(same).\n\n [4] We presume “that the Legislature did not intend to make the [provision] jurisdictional[,] a presumption overcome only\nby clear legislative intent to the contrary.” City of DeSoto v. White, 288 S.W.3d 389, 394 (Tex.2009). The statutes' language\nreflects no such intent here. Section 311.034 applies to prerequisites to suit, not notice requirements that can be satisfied only\nafter suit is filed. Compare TEX. GOV'T CODE § 311.034, with TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODEE § 89.0041 (requiring notice of\ncause number, court in which case is filed, and date of filing). Nor does Local Government Code section 89.0041 show such\nintent: that section states that a trial court may *926 dismiss a case for noncompliance only after the governmental entity has\nmoved for dismissal. TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODEE 89.0041(c) (“If a person does not give notice as required by this section, the\ncourt in which the suit is pending shall dismiss the suit on a motion for dismissal made by the county or the county official.”).\nThe motion requirement means that a case may proceed against those governmental entities that do not seek dismissal—in other\nwords, that a county can waive a party's noncompliance. This confirms that compliance with the notice requirements is not\njurisdictional. See Loutzenhiser, 140 S.W.3d at 359 (“The failure of a non-jurisdictional requirement mandated by statute may\nresult in the loss of a claim, but that failure must be timely asserted and compliance can be waived.”).

J. 900\n\n\nIV. Where the appropriate county officials receive timely notice of the suit, the case should not be dismissed if notice\nwas provided by some means other than mail.\nRoccaforte provided timely notice of every item required by section 89.0041, and the requisite officials received that notice.\nDid the Legislature intend to bar Roccaforte's claim, merely because that notice was hand-delivered rather than mailed?\n\nRoccaforte argues that the County's actual notice of the suit and his substantial compliance with section 89.0041 should suffice.\nA number of courts of appeals (though not the court of appeals in this case) agree with him. 11 The County disagrees, arguing\nthat the statute requires strict compliance with its terms, and dismissal is mandated if those terms are not satisfied.\n\n [5] Section 89.0041 ensures that the appropriate county officials are made aware of pending suits, allowing the county to\nanswer and defend the case. See Howlett, 301 S.W.3d at 846 (“The apparent purpose of section 89.0041 is to ensure that the\nperson responsible for answering and defending the suit—the county or district attorney-has actual notice of the suit itself.”);\nCoskey, 247 S.W.3d at 757 (“Section 89.0041's notice of suit requirement against a county serves the purpose of aiding in\nthe management and control of the City's finances and property....”). That purpose was served here—the county judge and the\ndistrict attorney had notice within fifteen days of Roccaforte's filing, and they answered and defended the suit. Cf. Loutzenhiser,\n140 S.W.3d at 360 (observing that “if in a particular case a governmental unit were not prejudiced by lack of notice and chose\nto waive it, we do not see how the statutory purpose would thereby be impaired”). The statute was not intended to create a\nprocedural trap allowing a county to obtain dismissal even though the appropriate officials have notice of the suit. See *927\nSouthern Surety Co. v. McGuire, 275 S.W. 845, 847 (Tex.Civ.App.-El Paso 1925, writ ref'd) (holding that failure to present\nwritten claim to commissioners' court as required by statute did not bar the claim, because “[t]he purpose of the statute was\nfully accomplished by [oral presentment]”); see also Coskey, 247 S.W.3d at 757 (“The manner of delivery specified by the\nstatute assures that county officials will receive notice of a suit after it has been filed to enable it to respond timely and prepare\na defense.”). Because those officers had the requisite notice, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing Roccaforte's\nclaims.\n\n\nV. Conclusion\nRoccaforte's claims against the County should not have been dismissed for lack of notice. 12 We reverse the court of appeals'\njudgment as to those claims and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings. TEX.R.APP. P. 60.2(d).\n\n\n\nJustice WILLETT delivered a concurring opinion.\n\nJustice WILLETT, concurring in part.\nI join Parts I–III of the Court's opinion. As for Part IV, I join the result but not the reasoning. There is a better approach, one\nmore allegiant to the Legislature's words. Roccaforte's claim should proceed, but the reason is rooted not in his substantial\ncompliance but rather the County's substantial dalliance.\n\n***\n\nAristotle would have enjoyed this case, which perfectly illustrates the challenge he recognized of reconciling the “absoluteness”\nof the written law with equity in the particular case. 1 Believing that “the equitable is superior” and that rigid laws must bend, 2\nAristotle urged “a correction of law where it is defective owing to its universality.” 3 From Athens, Greece to Athens, Texas\n(and beyond), judges still debate the bounds of interpretive discretion—whether it is appropriate to temper the “absoluteness”\nof statutory mandates and ameliorate their seeming harshness. Millennia may have passed since Aristotle's Lyceum, but this\ngreat philosophical and jurisprudential debate endures.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 900\n\n\n\n                                                                 I\n\nAs the Court persuasively explains in Part III, the post-suit notice requirements in Section 89.0041 are not jurisdictional,\nmeaning a County can waive a plaintiff's noncompliance. 4 Here, the County objected to Roccaforte's noncompliance,\nprompting the Court to ask: “Did the Legislature intend to bar Roccaforte's claim, merely because that notice was hand-delivered\nrather than mailed?” 5 If phrased that way, our recent and unanimous precedent answers the question “yes,” since “the surest\nguide to legislative intent” is the language lawmakers chose. 6 In other words, “Where text is clear, it is determinative of that\nintent.” 7 The Court today agrees that nothing in Section 89.0041 relieves *928 Roccaforte from compliance. So, to escape\nthe statute's emphatic “shall dismiss the suit” mandate, 8 the Court pivots on “actual notice” and “substantial compliance” and\nholds that the statute's purpose was fulfilled via hand-delivery.\n\nHonoring a statute's plain words is indispensable, even if enforcing those words as written works an unpalatable result. To be\nsure, courts deviate from otherwise-clear textual commands to avert “absurd” results or to vindicate constitutional principles. 9\nBut as a general matter, if the legal deck is stacked via technical statutory requirements, the Legislature should reshuffle the\nequities, not us. 10\n\n\nAs for whether Section 89.0041's use of phrases like “shall deliver,” 11 “must be delivered,” 12 “as required,” 13 and “shall\ndismiss” 14 mandates strict compliance, I would take the statute at face value. Beyond that, those desiring additional reassurance\nthat lawmakers intended what they enacted can find it in a properly contextual reading of other notice-related statutes.\n\nFirst, the Legislature, while omitting an actual-notice exception from Section 89.0041, expressly included one in the Tort Claims\nAct, stating the Act's pre-suit notice requirements “do not apply if the governmental unit has actual notice....” 15 The Legislature\nunderstands how to let actual notice excuse technical noncompliance; it easily could have said actual notice suffices, thus\nobviating the need for service via certified or registered mail. Instead, it opted against actual notice, presumably on purpose.\nFor better or worse, lawmakers enacted strict compliance, not substantial compliance. Our interpretive focus, both textual and\ncontextual, must be on the law as written, and we should refuse to engraft what the Legislature has refused to enact.\n\nSecond, reading “actual notice” into Section 89.0041's post-suit notice requirement robs it of any real meaning and also makes\nSection 89.004's pre-suit notice requirement redundant. Section 89.004 forbids someone from suing a county or county official\n“unless the person has presented the claim to the commissioners court and the commissioners court neglects or refuses to pay\nall or part of the claim....” 16 This presentment requirement assures actual notice of a claim before it is filed and was already\non the books when Section 89.0041 was added in 2003. Logically then, Section 89.0041 must require something in addition\nto the preexisting notice and presentment requirements. 17\n\n\n*929 The requisite officials here received notice, but they did not receive “requisite notice,” as the Court states. 18 The Court\nmay deem it adequate, but it is irrefutably not requisite. As the Court reads Section 89.0041, it is not only nonjurisdictional (I\nagree on this point), but also nonmandatory. I acknowledge the statute's no-exceptions mandate works a harsh result, 19 but to\nthe degree this seems a trap for the unwary, it is a trap the Legislature left well marked.\n\n\n\n                                                                II\n\nHaving said all that, I agree with the Court that Roccaforte ultimately wins his notice dispute, but on different grounds.

J. 900\n\n\nI would rephrase the question in a manner less assaultive to the statutory text: Did the County effectively waive Roccaforte's\nnoncompliance by not timely asserting it? I believe so. 20\n\n *930 True, the County, after waiting for limitations to expire, filed a motion for dismissal complaining that Roccaforte\nprovided notice via personal service rather than registered or certified mail. I believe that obscures the key point, which on\nthese facts is not whether the County sought dismissal, but when. A governmental body can raise a jurisdictional bar like\nimmunity from suit whenever it pleases because “the trial court does not have—and never had—power to decide the case,” 21\nthus making judgments forever vulnerable to delayed attack. Not so with nonjurisdictional requirements like this, which are\nwaived if not timely raised. Under our precedent, dismissal delayed is sometimes dismissal denied: “The failure of a non-\njurisdictional requirement mandated by statute may result in the loss of a claim, but that failure must be timely asserted and\ncompliance can be waived.” 22 Moreover, “if a governmental unit is to avoid litigation to which it should not be subjected\nbecause of lack of notice, it should raise the issue as soon as possible.” 23 On these facts, there was no timely assertion, much\nless one made “as soon as possible.” 24\n\n\nWe have held that waiver is decided on a case-by-case basis, meaning courts look to the totality of the circumstances. 25 Here,\n *931 the County sought dismissal based on imperfect notice more than two years after suit was filed; more than two years\nafter the County filed its answer; more than two years after the County filed its special exceptions; after the County presented\nthree County officials for deposition and defended those depositions; after the County sent written discovery requests; after\nthe County deposed Roccaforte; and after the County filed a motion for continuance. If two-plus years qualifies as “timely\nasserted” or “as soon as possible”—at least in the context of a statutory notice requirement commanding action—then these\nphrases have been drained of all meaning. 26 Indeed, the only thing the County “timely asserted” was limitations. I would\ndisallow the County's belated insistence on dismissal given its decision to defend the case for so long, asserting noncompliance\nonly after seizing tactical advantage via limitations, and thus materially prejudicing Roccaforte. There is no countervailing\nprejudice in allowing Roccaforte's suit to proceed against the County, which can hardly argue at this late stage that imperfect\nnotice has harmed its legal position (unlike its fiscal position, having underwritten years of legal and judicial expenses). On\nthese facts, two-plus years of litigation activity to run out the limitations clock betrays the County's too-little, too-late request\nfor dismissal and constitutes waiver.\n\nThe Court's understandable desire to work an eminently fair result has led it to revise the statute as desired rather than read it as\nenacted. I favor a different approach to the same outcome. Roccaforte should win not because the Court waived the Legislature's\nwords but because the County did.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n32 IER Cases 346, 54 Tex. Sup. Ct.

Tarrant\n       Cnty., 301 S.W.3d 840, 847 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2009, pet. denied) (holding that substantial compliance with Section 89.0041 was\n       sufficient because the purpose of the statute was to ensure notice, and that purpose was accomplished); Ballesteros v.

Two\n       of the three courts of appeals even cite as support two of our decisions involving notice in other contexts. Coskey, 247 S.W.3d at\n       757 (“Both Artco–Bell Corp. and Cox Enterprises, Inc.. support a standard of substantial compliance with notice requirements under\n       certain circumstances, and we conclude that standard applies in these circumstances.”) (citations omitted); Ballesteros, 286 S.W.3d\n       at 571–72. A third court of appeals opinion in turn relies upon Coskey. See Autry, 251 S.W.3d at 158.\n          Closer analysis reveals Coskey and Ballesteros offer feeble support, as they misinterpret this Court's holdings in Cox Enters., Inc.\n          v. Bd. of Trs. of Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 706 S.W.2d 956 (Tex.1986), and Artco–Bell Corp. v. City of Temple, 616 S.W.2d 190\n          (Tex.1981). The issue in Cox involved how much particularity was required in notice. 706 S.W.2d at 960 (noting that “less than\n          full disclosure is not substantial compliance” and that “the Open Meetings Act requires a full disclosure of the subject matter of\n          the meetings”). Artco–Bell is likewise inapposite. In Artco–Bell, the Court simply invalidated the notice requirement in a city's\n          charter and held the plaintiff had provided sufficient notice. 616 S.W.2d at 193–94 (“[W]e hold that the requirement of verification\n          represents an unreasonable limitation on the City's liability and is invalid as it is contrary to the limitation of authority placed upon\n          home rule cities....”) (footnote omitted).\n          Cox was about the specificity of notice; Artco–Bell resulted in the invalidation of notice. In neither case did the Court craft an\n          exception for notice. The lower courts' treatment of these cases was thus strained, and should not be taken as a correct reading of\n          our jurisprudence on statutory notice requirements.\n18     341 S.W.3d at 927.\n19     Had the County “timely asserted” Roccaforte's noncompliance, dismissal would have been mandatory under the statute's rigid, no-\n       discretion mandate, thus raising the question of whether Section 89.0041's notice regime is preempted by 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Univ.\n       of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Loutzenhiser, 140 S.W.3d 351, 359 (Tex.2004) (“The failure of a non-jurisdictional requirement mandated\n       by statute may result in the loss of a claim, but that failure must be timely asserted and compliance can be waived.”). That question,\n       while interesting legally, is not before us.\n20     Waiver may actually be the wrong term; it may be more accurate to call this forfeiture. As the United States Supreme Court explains:\n       “Waiver is different from forfeiture. Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the intentional\n       relinquishment of a known right.” United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (emphasis\n       added) (citations and quotation marks omitted). In any event, under our definition:\n            “[W]aiver” is the intentional relinquishment of a right actually or constructively known, or intentional conduct inconsistent with\n            claiming that right. The elements of waiver include (1) an existing right, benefit, or advantage held by a party; (2) the party's\n            actual or constructive knowledge of its existence; and (3) the party's actual intent to relinquish the right or intentional conduct\n            inconsistent with the right.\n          Perry Homes v. Cull, 258 S.W.3d 580, 602–03 (Tex.2008) (citations omitted).\n21     In re United Servs. Auto.

For example, even the most\n       ardent textualist would read a statute of limitations in light of the common-law rules of equitable tolling. See Young v. United States,\n       535 U.S. 43, 49, 122 S.Ct. 1036, 152 L.Ed.2d 79 (2002) (“It is hornbook law that limitations periods are customarily subject to\n       equitable tolling, unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.”) (citations and quotation marks omitted);\n       see also United States v. Beggerly, 524 U.S. 38, 48, 118 S.Ct. 1862, 141 L.Ed.2d 32 (1998). As Justice Scalia noted in Young, a\n       limitations period is subject to the principles of equitable tolling, so long as the statutory text does not preclude such tolling. 535 U.S.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Same here, where the Legislature drafts notice requirements in light of our decisions differentiating between\n       mandatory and jurisdictional provisions and the consequences that flow from each characterization.\n25     See Perry Homes, 258 S.W.3d at 589–91 (explaining that a party waives an arbitration clause by engaging in substantial litigation\n       to the other party's detriment or prejudice).\n           In Jernigan v. Langley, the Court considered whether a defendant physician waived his statutory right to contest the adequacy\n           of the plaintiff's expert reports by waiting too long. 111 S.W.3d 153, 153 (Tex.2003). The Court held that delay does not always\n           result in waiver, but it does when the defendant's silence or inaction for such a long period shows an intent to yield a known\n           right. Id. at 157. I would hold that the County's actions are inconsistent with the intent to assert its statutory right to up-front\n           dismissal based on defective notice. Moreover, Jernigan predates our 2004 decision in Loutzenhiser, which speaks specifically\n           to statutorily mandated notice requirements involving governmental units and says notice-based objections should be asserted “as\n           soon as possible.” 140 S.W.3d at 360.\n26     It is true that defendants may assert defenses like limitations in the trial court even following extensive discovery and other pre-trial\n       activity. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 94 (affirmative defenses including limitations must be pleaded); TEX.R. CIV. P. 63 (pleadings may\n       be amended without leave of court until seven days before trial). Today's case, though, involves a statutory notice requirement that\n       mandates action within a prescribed time, something Loutzenhiser held should be raised “as soon as possible” since the statutory\n       purpose is to avoid litigation altogether. 140 S.W.3d at 360.\n           Section 89.0041 may not be a prerequisite to bringing suit, but it is a postrequisite to maintaining suit. In my view, Section 89.0041,\n           unlike the Tort Claims Act, does not allow actual notice to forgive defective notice, but that does not mean actual notice may not\n           affect the waiver inquiry of whether a defendant “timely asserted” noncompliance. For reasons stated above, I believe a county that\n           quickly asserts statutory noncompliance, even if it has actual notice, is entitled to dismissal under Section 89.0041. But a county\n           with actual notice that untimely asserts noncompliance (here only after limitations had run two-plus years later) has waived its\n           objection and is not entitled to dismissal. See City of DeSoto v. White, 288 S.W.3d 389, 400–01 (Tex.2009) (noting that a party that\n           declines to act in light of “full knowledge” of a defect in a nonjurisdictional notice requirement generally waives any complaint).\n           Any other result would incentivize counties to sit on their rights rather than assert them immediately. Here, the County would\n           be rewarded for wasting over two-years' worth of judicial resources and taxpayer dollars in defending a suit it could have easily\n           dismissed from the outset.\n       ***\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

FACTS\n\nIn the 1970s, John Swanson and his brother George Swanson approached SEDCO, Inc. about a proposal to mine diamonds\nfrom the ocean floor in deep waters off the South African coast. SEDCO had expertise in offshore oil and gas drilling and had\nmined manganese nodules off the ocean floor. The Swansons, whose family had been in the mining industry in South Africa for\nseveral decades, had contacts with the South African government. By letter dated October 17, 1978, SEDCO agreed to a three-\nphase project. In Phase I, SEDCO would study the feasibility of the sea-diamond project. In Phase II, a lease was to be acquired\nand prospecting was to begin. Phase III was to be commercial mining. The agreement provided that SEDCO had exclusive\nauthority to determine whether to proceed with Phases II and III.\n\nThe Swansons were to use their goodwill and contacts to obtain concession rights and any licenses or permits the South African\ngovernment required. They also were to provide SEDCO with information on diamond mining generally and offshore mining\nspecifically. For their part, the Swansons would be paid a consulting fee through Phases I and II and a royalty, if any, on any\ndiamonds mined during Phases II and III. Should the project ever become commercially productive, the Swansons had the right\nto purchase five percent of the shares in the company contemplated to be formed to mine the diamonds. SEDCO was to bear the\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                          4\n\fSchlumberger Technology Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171 (1997)\n41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 165\n\nexpense of all phases of the project, with the exception of the Swansons' own out-of-pocket expenses. Any diamond grants or\noffshore concessions or leases were to be held by SEDCO, by the company to be formed, or by the Swansons, but as trustees.\n\nSEDCO completed Phase I in 1979 and opted to proceed with Phase II. In July 1983, SEDCO and George E. Swanson\nEnterprises, as co-lessees, obtained a prospecting lease, Lease 3C, from the South African government. At the same time,\nthe South African government issued leases on surrounding tracts to other companies. DeBeers Mining Consolidated Limited\n(DeBeers) obtained Leases 4C and 5C immediately to the south; African Selection Trust Exploration (Pty.) Limited (Seltrust),\na subsidiary of British Petroleum, obtained Lease 2C to the north.\n\nAlmost immediately after receiving the leases, SEDCO, DeBeers, and Seltrust began negotiating a joint venture agreement\nto jointly develop the mining project. In December 1984, before this joint venture agreement was finalized, Schlumberger\nTechnology Corporation acquired SEDCO by merger and formed Sedswan Diamonds (Pty.), Limited, a wholly-owned South\nAfrican subsidiary, to continue the sea-diamond project. Sedswan then entered into the joint venture with DeBeers and Seltrust\nin February 1985. Around the same time, the South African government reissued Lease 3C in Sedswan's name only and without\nreference to George E. Swanson Enterprises. Sedswan, DeBeers, and Seltrust participated in the joint venture through 1986.\nIn early January *174 1987, the Swansons became concerned about rumors that Schlumberger was going to stop funding\nits share or withdraw from the joint venture. Further, they were disturbed about the lack of information they were receiving\non the project's progress. Consequently, the Swansons consulted a lawyer. Their objectives were to ensure that Schlumberger\nstayed in the joint venture and that their rights under the original letter agreement, which predated the joint venture agreement,\nwere enforced. Of particular concern to the Swansons was the effect of the joint venture agreement on the Swansons' interests,\nincluding Schlumberger's ability to dilute Sedswan's joint venture interest after an initial investment, the right of first refusal\ngiven to the other joint venture members, and a confidentiality agreement.\n\nShortly after the Swansons hired their lawyer, Schlumberger gave notice to DeBeers and Seltrust of its intent to withdraw\nSedswan from the joint venture. As required by the joint venture agreement, Schlumberger offered to sell Sedswan's interest\nto the remaining joint venture members. DeBeers and Seltrust rejected this offer, each refusing to buy out Sedswan's interest\nso long as it was subject to any rights the Swansons may claim.\n\nDuring the next thirteen months, Schlumberger negotiated its withdrawal from and a price for Sedswan's joint venture interest\nwith DeBeers and Seltrust. Schlumberger initially offered to sell Sedswan's interest for twenty-five million dollars plus a royalty.\nDeBeers and Seltrust rejected this offer and countered at ten million rand. Schlumberger dropped its demand for a royalty and\noffered to sell for thirty-five million dollars. Again, DeBeers and Seltrust rejected this offer, holding firm at ten million rand.\n\nThroughout this time, Schlumberger discussed the various proposals with the Swansons, communicating mostly through their\nlawyer. According to the Swansons, Schlumberger represented to them that the sea-diamond project was neither technologically\nfeasible nor commercially viable, but refused to give them joint venture progress reports and other information and data\nsupporting Schlumberger's views. During these negotiations, Schlumberger also disputed the validity of the Swansons' rights\nand interests in the joint venture, claiming that the joint venture agreement altered whatever rights the Swansons had.\nDispleased with Schlumberger's decision to withdraw Sedswan from the joint venture and concerned about Schlumberger's\nassertions disputing their interests and its unwillingness to turn over joint venture information, the Swansons contemplated\nsuing Schlumberger but did not.\n\nInstead, in February 1988, a little more than a year after Schlumberger gave notice of its withdrawal from the joint venture, the\nSwansons agreed that Schlumberger would buy their interest for two million South African rand (about $814,000). In exchange,\nthe Swansons relinquished all rights, claims, and interests in the offshore diamond project and Lease 3C and released all causes\nof action against Schlumberger, known or unknown. In the release, the Swansons specifically agreed that they were not relying\non any statement or representation of Schlumberger, SEDCO, or Sedswan, that they were relying on their own judgment, and\nthat they had been represented by counsel who had explained the entire contents and legal consequences of the release.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 165\n\nSchlumberger thereafter sold Sedswan's interest to DeBeers and Seltrust for 10 million rand (about $4,100,000). After recouping\nits investment in the project of 6.8 million rand (about $2,767,000), buying out the Swansons' interests for two million\nrand (about $814,000) and paying them an additional $200,000 in consulting fees, Schlumberger netted 778,000 rand (about\n$319,000) from the offshore diamond project.\n\nAsserting that Schlumberger had misrepresented the project's viability and value, the Swansons then sued Schlumberger and\nits parent corporation, Schlumberger Limited, Inc., for fraudulently inducing them to sell their interest at an undervalued price.\nThe Swansons also alleged breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nThe jury found for the Swansons and against Schlumberger on all issues. The jury awarded the Swansons fifteen million dollars\nin actual damages, thirty-five million *175 dollars in exemplary damages on a statutory fraud claim under section 27.01 of\nthe Texas Business and Commerce Code, ten million dollars in exemplary damages on the common law claims, and attorney's\nfees. As already mentioned, the trial court rendered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but the court of appeals reversed\nand rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's findings. 895 S.W.2d 719.\n\nHere, Schlumberger contends that the release precludes all of the Swansons' claims as a matter of law; that there is no evidence\nof common law fraud, statutory fraud under section 27.01 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, or breach of fiduciary\nduty; and that the court of appeals erred in awarding prejudgment interest on future damages. We agree that the release precludes\nall of the Swansons' claims as a matter of law. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and render judgment for\nSchlumberger. Because of our disposition, we need not reach the prejudgment interest issue.\n\n\n\n                                           II. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES\n\nSchlumberger argues that the Swansons' fraud claims are barred as a matter of law because the Swansons were represented\nby legal counsel throughout the arm's-length negotiations between the parties. Schlumberger contends that when a party is\nrepresented by counsel and that party agrees that, in signing a release, it is not relying on any statement or representation of the\nparty to be released, the presence of independent legal advice breaks the chain of both reliance and causation. Schlumberger\nreasons that if parties can refute their reliance, even though they were represented by counsel when they settled their claims,\nlitigation never ends. This is so, Schlumberger says, because dissatisfied parties could always break their settlement by claiming\nthat the other party, through its misrepresentations, fraudulently induced them to enter into the settlement or release.\n\nImportant to Schlumberger's position is its assertion that it was negotiating with the Swansons at arm's length. Schlumberger\ncontends that it openly disputed the validity of the Swansons' interests in the sea-diamond project. Schlumberger further\ncontends that,by virtue of the extended adversarial negotiations through legal counsel over the Swansons' rights and the buyout\nof their interests, if any, Schlumberger did not owe a fiduciary duty to the Swansons during the negotiations.\n\nThe Swansons respond, however, that there was a long-standing fiduciary relationship that arose either because Schlumberger\nand the Swansons were partners or because they were parties to a confidential relationship. Given that relationship, the Swansons\nargue, Schlumberger cannot unilaterally eliminate the fiduciary duty by generating a dispute with the Swansons.\n\nAs the relationship between the parties informs both parties' arguments on the effect of the disclaimer of reliance, we must first\ndetermine the nature of that relationship.\n\n\n\n                                                       A. PARTNERSHIP\n\nIn Johnson v. Peckham, 132 Tex. 148, 120 S.W.2d 786, 788 (1938), we held that a partner selling his interest to another partner\nhas a fiduciary duty requiring full disclosure of all important information about the value of the interest. This is true, we said,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              6\n\fSchlumberger Technology Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171 (1997)\n41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 165\n\neven though the partners had strained relations and one partner had sued for an accounting and dissolution of the partnership.\nJohnson, 120 S.W.2d at 788. “If the existence of strained relations should be suffered to work an exception [to the fiduciary\nrelationship], then a designing fiduciary could easily bring about such relations to set the stage for a sharp bargain.” Id. We\nconcluded that more mischief would result from relieving the fiduciary of his duty to make full disclosure than from requiring\nadherence to his fiduciary responsibilities. Id. If Schlumberger and the Swansons were partners, Johnson counsels that their\nnegotiations terminating their relationship would not be at arm's length, but would be conducted under the higher fiduciary\nstandard requiring full disclosure.\n\nSchlumberger does not challenge Johnson on principle, but contends that there is no evidence of a partnership between it and\nthe Swansons. We agree.\n\n *176 At the outset, we note that the Legislature revised the Texas Uniform Partnership Act in 1993, effective January 1994. Act\nof May 31, 1993, 73d Leg. R.S., ch. 917, § 1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3887. As the Swansons and SEDCO originally formed their\nenterprise in 1978, the pre–1993 statute and case law decided under that statute control our determination. See TEX.REV.CIV.\nSTAT. ANN.. art. 6132b, § 47.\n\n [1] Under the Texas Uniform Partnership Act, a partnership or joint venture is an association of two or more persons to carry\non as co-owners a business for profit. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. ANN.. art. 6132b, § 6. As the issue was submitted to the jury, a\npartnership consists of an express or implied agreement containing four required elements: (1) a community of interest in the\nventure, (2) an agreement to share profits, (3) an agreement to share losses, and (4) a mutual right of control or management\nof the enterprise. See Coastal Plains Dev. Corp. v. Micrea, Inc., 572 S.W.2d 285, 287 (Tex.1978). Accordingly, if there is no\nevidence of any one element of a partnership, we cannot sustain the jury's affirmative finding.\n\n [2] We conclude that there is no evidence of an agreement to share profits. The undisputed evidence is that the Swansons were\nto receive a royalty on diamonds mined in Phases II and III and that their royalty was to be paid before expenses. Entitlement\nto a royalty based on gross receipts is not profit sharing. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. ANN.. art. 6132b, § 7(3) (sharing gross\nreturns does not itself establish partnership); see also Patton v. Callaway, 522 S.W.2d 252, 256 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1975,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.). Of course, the payment of consultation fees is not the sharing of profits. Such payments are compensation for\nservices rendered and are unrelated to the venture's profits. See Grimmett v. Higginbotham, 907 S.W.2d 1, 2–4 (Tex.App.—\nTyler 1994, writ denied) (weekly compensation unrelated to financial requirements of business is no evidence of agreement\nto share profits or losses); Gutierrez v. Yancey, 650 S.W.2d 169, 172 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1983, no writ) (partners must\nparticipate in profits and share them as principals of business and not as compensation).\n\n [3] The Swansons further urge, though, that an agreement to share profits is evidenced by the fact that they received part of\nthe sale proceeds for Sedswan's joint venture interest. But this is evidence only that the Swansons may have had an interest\nin the sea-diamond project. It is circular to contend that the payment in settlement of the Swansons' disputed interests proves\nthose interests. The two million rand Schlumberger paid the Swansons to settle and release their claimed interests in the sea-\ndiamond project is no evidence of an agreement to share partnership profits.\n\n [4] Because there is no evidence of an agreement to share profits, there is no evidence of a partnership under the question\nsubmitted to the jury. This conclusion renders unnecessary any consideration of Schlumberger's other evidentiary contentions\non the remaining elements of a partnership. We conclude that the Swansons and Schlumberger were not partners.\n\n\n\n                                          B. CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP\n\nThe Swansons claim that even if the technical requirements of a partnership are not satisfied, they were nonetheless owed a\nfiduciary duty by Schlumberger arising out of a confidential relationship. Agreeing with the Swansons, the jury found that\nbetween January 1987 (when Schlumberger decided to withdraw Sedswan from the joint venture) and October 1988 (when\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 165\n\nthe release was finally signed and the transaction closed), Schlumberger and the Swansons had a relationship of special trust\nand confidence and that Schlumberger breached its fiduciary duty arising from that relationship by making representations that\nfraudulently induced the Swansons to sign the release.\n\n [5] [6] An informal relationship may give rise to a fiduciary duty where one person trusts in and relies on another, whether\nthe relation is a moral, social, domestic, or purely personal one. See Thigpen v. Locke, 363 S.W.2d 247, 253 (Tex.1962); Fitz–\nGerald v. Hull, 150 Tex. 39, 237 S.W.2d 256, 261 (1951). But not every relationship involving a high *177 degree of trust and\nconfidence rises to the stature of a fiduciary relationship. See Crim Truck & Tractor Co. v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp., 823\nS.W.2d 591, 594 (Tex.1992). In order to give full force to contracts, we do not create such a relationship lightly. See Thigpen,\n363 S.W.2d at 253. Accordingly, while a fiduciary or confidential relationship may arise from the circumstances of a particular\ncase, to impose such a relationship in a business transaction, the relationship must exist prior to, and apart from, the agreement\nmade the basis of the suit. See Transport Ins. Co. v. Faircloth, 898 S.W.2d 269, 280 (Tex.1995). In this case, there is no evidence\nthat a prior fiduciary relationship had arisen between the Swansons and Schlumberger.\n\n [7] [8] We recognize that the Swansons testified that they trusted and relied on Schlumberger to negotiate a fair price\nwith DeBeers and Seltrust for Sedswan's interest in the joint venture. However, mere subjective trust does not, as a matter of\nlaw, transform arm's-length dealing into a fiduciary relationship. See Crim Truck, 823 S.W.2d at 595. In addition, though, the\nSwansons point out that certain Schlumberger and SEDCO executives testified that the Swansons were their “partners” in the\nsea-diamond project, and that the original lease application to the South African government and the original lease from the\nSouth African government provided that SEDCO and the Swansons were partners. The Swansons maintain that this evidence\nestablished, at the very minimum, that both parties believed a confidential relationship existed, providing some evidence to\nsupport the jury's finding. Again, the fact that the parties to a transaction trust one another will not, in and of itself, establish\na finding of a confidential relationship. See Thigpen, 363 S.W.2d at 253. Instead, to impose such a relationship in a business\ntransaction, “ ‘there must be a fiduciary relationship before, and apart from, the agreement made the basis of the suit.’ ” Tyra\nv. Woodson, 495 S.W.2d 211, 213 (Tex.1973) (quoting Consolidated Gas & Equip. Co. v. Thompson, 405 S.W.2d 333, 336\n(Tex.1966)). As we have said, there is no evidence of a prior fiduciary relationship in this case.\n\n [9] The Swansons next rely on evidence that Schlumberger thought it had an obligation to get the best deal it could for itself\nand the Swansons, to “put the Swansons' interest at least equal” to its own, and that it was representing the Swansons' interest in\nnegotiating with DeBeers and Seltrust. This evidence proves only that Schlumberger's interests were aligned with the Swansons'\nto obtain the best possible price for Sedswan's joint venture interest and, to that end, Schlumberger spoke not only for itself,\nbut also for the Swansons. To permit any further inference would impose a fiduciary relationship in every contract because all\ncontracting parties presumably contract for their mutual benefit. Once again, the fact that Schlumberger and the Swansons were\naligned does not create a confidential relationship giving rise to a fiduciary duty in the absence of a prior relationship.\n\nFinally, the Swansons argue that Manges v. Guerra, 673 S.W.2d 180 (Tex.1984), imposes a fiduciary duty on Schlumberger. In\nManges, we recognized that a holder of executive rights to a mineral estate owes a fiduciary duty to the non-executive interest.\n673 S.W.2d at 183. That is not the situation here. Manges simply is inapposite.\n\nWe conclude that there is no evidence of a partnership or confidential relationship between Schlumberger and the Swansons\nthat would give rise to a fiduciary duty on Schlumberger's part.\n\n\n\n                                             III. DISCLAIMER OF RELIANCE\n\nGiven that Schlumberger and the Swansons were dealing with each other at arm's length, we now turn to Schlumberger's\ncontention that the disclaimer of reliance clause in the release precludes the Swansons' fraudulent inducement claim. It does.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             8\n\fSchlumberger Technology Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171 (1997)\n41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 165\n\nTo support their fraudulent inducement claim, the Swansons alleged that Schlumberger made several affirmative\nmisrepresentations during their negotiations over the withdrawal of Sedswan from the joint venture. The Swansons had seen\nan April 1986 Schlumberger evaluation that described the project as “economical,” but noted that the “commerciality” of the\nproject would not be *178 determined until 1988 or 1989. Despite the 1986 evaluation, and without having undertaken any\nlater studies, Schlumberger represented to the Swansons that the project was neither technologically feasible nor commercially\nviable. In addition, Schlumberger represented that the project had a negative value and that Sedswan would be lucky to get\nout with its costs.\n\n [10] At trial, the evidence was undisputed that there are diamonds on the ocean floor off South Africa. It was further undisputed\nthat, as of the time of trial in 1993, no one had begun mining diamonds. Also, it was undisputed that Seltrust's successor sold its\ninterest to DeBeers in 1992 for only slightly more than its project costs. On the other hand, there was substantial dispute about\nwhether the project was technologically feasible or commercially viable. Schlumberger brings a point of error asserting that\nthere is legally insufficient evidence of fraud, but it does not argue in its briefing in this Court that its representations about the\nproject's technological or commercial infeasibility were immaterial, were merely opinion, or were either not knowingly made\nor not made without knowledge of the truth. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Jefferson Assocs., 896 S.W.2d 156, 163 (Tex.1995).\nAccordingly, we assume, as we must, that Schlumberger misrepresented the project's technological feasibility and commercial\nviability and that such misrepresentations are actionable as fraudulent inducement.\n\nIn this light, Schlumberger asks us to adopt a per se rule that the presence of independent legal counsel always precludes a\nclaim that a party fraudulently induced a release. Texas law does not support such a rule.\n\n [11] Texas law favors and encourages voluntary settlements and orderly dispute resolution. However, a release is a contract,\nand like any other contract, is subject to avoidance on grounds such as fraud or mistake. See Williams v. Glash, 789 S.W.2d\n261, 264 (Tex.1990); Dallas Farm Mach. Co. v. Reaves, 158 Tex. 1, 307 S.W.2d 233, 236–37 (1957). Yet our early decisions\nare not entirely consistent. Several of our opinions conclude that a release could be set aside if it was induced by a fraudulent\nrepresentation or promise—even if the release contained language disclaiming that any such representation had been made.\nOther cases hold to the contrary.\n\nIn Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Presley, 137 Tex. 232, 152 S.W.2d 1105 (Tex.1941), an injured worker settled his claim\nagainst his employer for $50, executing a release providing that he relied upon his own judgment as to the extent and duration\nof his injuries and that no promise of employment or other agreement not mentioned in the release had been made to him. Id.\nat 1106. The worker later sued to set aside the release, contending that his employer's doctor had misrepresented the extent\nof his injuries and that the employer had promised him permanent employment for executing the release, with no intention of\nfulfilling that promise. See id. We held that proof of these contentions would be sufficient to set aside the release. Id. at 1108.\nThis could be done, we decided, even though the plaintiff may have read and understood the release. Id. at 1107.\n\nSimilarly, in Edward Thompson Co. v. Sawyers, 111 Tex. 374, 234 S.W. 873 (1921), a buyer purchased a set of legal\nencyclopedias based on the seller's oral promise that it would continue to publish and deliver annual supplements for at least\nfifteen years. The buyer proved that the seller made this promise with no intention of fulfilling it. We held that this constituted\nfraud sufficient to set aside the agreement, even though the written contract provided that no representations or guaranties had\nbeen made by the seller that were not expressed therein. “Promises made without intention of fulfillment, in order to induce\nothers to make contracts, are as culpable and as harmful as are willful misrepresentations of existing facts. Hence contracts\nmay be avoided alike for such fraudulent promises and for such misrepresentations.” Id. at 874. We explained that, where a\ncontract is induced by fraud, there is in reality no contract because there is no “real assent” to the agreement. Id. Thus, the\ndefrauded party is not bound by any of the contractual provisions, “including those relating to representations or guaranties\nwhich induced its execution.” Id. at 874–75.\n\n*179 There are other early cases, however, that reach the opposite result. For example, in Distributors Investment Co. v.\nPatton, 130 Tex. 449, 110 S.W.2d 47 (Tex.1937), the seller of a tractor sued the buyer on his promissory note. In defense,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                9\n\fSchlumberger Technology Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171 (1997)\n41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 165\n\nthe buyer contended that the seller had fraudulently induced the transaction by orally misrepresenting the tractor's capabilities.\nThe contract provided that the tractor was sold “as is,” and further provided that no other representations had been made. Id.\nat 48. We held that, in light of these contract provisions, an action for rescission could not be maintained on account of oral\nrepresentations. Although recognizing that “fraud vitiates a contract,” we concluded that the fraud must be something more\nthan merely oral representations that conflict with the terms of the written contract. Id. Instead, to vitiate the contract, the fraud\nmust be such that it “prevents the coming into existence of any valid contract at all.” Id.; see also Avery Co. v. Harrison Co.,\n267 S.W. 254, 256 (Tex. Com. App.1924, judgm't adopted); J.I. Case Threshing Mach. Co. v. Manes, 254 S.W. 929, 931 (Tex.\nCom. App.1923, judgm't adopted); Wright v. Couch, 54 S.W.2d 207, 209 (Tex.Civ.App.—Eastland 1932, no writ).\n\nIn Dallas Farm Machinery Co. v. Reaves, 158 Tex. 1, 307 S.W.2d 233 (1957), we considered whether parol evidence was\nadmissible, despite a merger clause in a written contract, to establish that a contract was induced by fraud. The seller brought\nsuit against the purchaser of a tractor and loader for the balance due on the purchase contract. The buyer counterclaimed for\nrescission, claiming that he was fraudulently induced to contract by false representations about the work capacities of the tractor\nand loader. The seller argued that a merger clause providing that the contract was “the entire contract relating to the sale and\nwarranty” of the equipment and that “no warranty is made or authorized to be made other than herein set forth” precluded the\nbuyer's fraudulent inducement claim. Id. at 234. In resolving the parties' dispute, we considered the two lines of cases discussed\npreviously and concluded that they represented conflicting lines of authority that could not be distinguished on any principled\nground. See id. at 238–39. We resolved the conflict by holding, as a matter of policy, that a merger clause can be avoided based\non fraud in the inducement and that the parol evidence rule does not bar proof of such fraud. See id. at 239. In doing so, we\nbrought the law on the subject “into harmony with the great weight of authority, with the rule of the Restatement of the Law\nof Contracts, and with the views of eminent textwriters.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\nJuxtaposed to this authority, we have a competing concern—the ability of parties to fully and finally resolve disputes between\nthem. Parties should be able to bargain for and execute a release barring all further dispute. This principle necessarily\ncontemplates that parties may disclaim reliance on representations. And such a disclaimer, where the parties' intent is clear and\nspecific, should be effective to negate a fraudulent inducement claim. As an example, a disclaimer of reliance may conclusively\nnegate the element of reliance, which is essential to a fraudulent inducement claim. See Prudential, 896 S.W.2d at 161–62\n(holding that agreement to buy property “as is,” in which buyer included “voluntary, freely negotiated affirmation that he was\ndepending on his own assessment of the building,” precluded claim for damages when building was found to contain asbestos);\nEstes v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 46 S.W.2d 413, 417–18 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1932, writ ref'd) (affirming directed\nverdict upholding release where evidence conclusively negated reliance on alleged misrepresentations). The question is under\nwhich circumstances such disclaimers are binding.\n\n [12] In this case, the Swansons contend that they agreed to Schlumberger's low-price buyout offer only after they were induced\nby misrepresentations about the value and feasibility of the sea-diamond project. We conclude that our well-established rules\nof contract interpretation govern whether the Swansons gave the requisite clear and unequivocal expression of intent necessary\nto disclaim reliance on these specific representations by Schlumberger. The contract and the circumstances surrounding its\nformation determine whether the disclaimer of reliance is binding. See Columbia Gas Transmission *180 Corp. v. New Ulm\nGas, Ltd., 940 S.W.2d 587, 591 (Tex.1996); National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.1995);\nPrudential, 896 S.W.2d at 162. Because the parties were attempting to put an end to their deal, and had become embroiled in a\ndispute over the feasibility and value of the project, we conclude that the disclaimer of reliance the Swansons gave conclusively\nnegates the element of reliance.\n\nIn negotiating the release, highly competent and able legal counsel represented both parties and, as we have said above,\nthe parties were dealing at arm's length. Further, both Schlumberger and the Swansons are knowledgeable and sophisticated\nbusiness players. The Swansons have been involved in traditional diamond mining in South Africa for several decades. They\nand Schlumberger, a multinational corporation, were engaged in a business venture involving tens of millions of dollars and in\nnegotiations to sell their interests ultimately for several million dollars.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              10\n\fSchlumberger Technology Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171 (1997)\n41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 165\n\nSignificantly, throughout the parties' negotiations, the Swansons disagreed with Schlumberger about the feasibility and value\nof the sea-diamond project. Schlumberger never convinced the Swansons that DeBeers' offer was a good deal; four days\nbefore he signed the release, John Swanson wrote to his attorney that the Swansons' lease interest was “worth billions.” The\nSwansons seriously considered suing Schlumberger even before the sale to DeBeers and Seltrust. Indeed, the release states that\nthe Swansons claimed that they had an interest in the mining consortium and in Schlumberger's prospecting lease, and that\nSchlumberger was “liable to the Swansons in connection with the prospecting or exploration of diamonds or other precious\nstones or minerals in South Africa.” In this connection, the release recites that\n\n            there is considerable doubt, disagreement, dispute and controversy with reference to the validity of the\n            Swansons' claim against [Schlumberger] and as to the legal or moral liability of [Schlumberger] for any\n            amount of damages or justification for legal relief, and there is further doubt, disagreement, uncertainty\n            and confusion as to the amount of said liability, if any.\n\nFurther, the Swansons released all “causes of action of whatsoever nature, or any other legal theory arising out of the\ncircumstances described above, from any and all liability damages of any kind known or unknown, whether in contract or tort.”\nThe sole purpose of the release was to end the dispute about the value of this commercial project between Schlumberger and\nthe Swansons once and for all.\n\nIn this context and in clear language, the Swansons unequivocally disclaimed reliance upon representations by Schlumberger\nabout the project's feasibility and value. They said:\n\n            [E]ach of us [the Swansons] expressly warrants and represents and does hereby state ... and represent ...\n            that no promise or agreement which is not herein expressed has been made to him or her in executing\n            this release, and that none of us is relying upon any statement or representation of any agent of the\n            parties being released hereby. Each of us is relying on his or her own judgment and each has been\n            represented by Hubert Johnson as legal counsel in this matter. The aforesaid legal counsel has read and\n            explained to each of us the entire contents of this Release in Full, as well as the legal consequences of\n            this Release .... (emphasis added)\n\n\nBecause courts are to assume that the parties intended every contractual provision to have some meaning, see Columbia Gas,\n940 S.W.2d at 591; Lenape Resources Corp. v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 925 S.W.2d 565, 574 (Tex.1996), we must presume\nthat the parties contemplated, by the inclusion of this clause, that the Swansons would not rely on any representations of\nSchlumberger about the commercial feasibility and value of this project, which, after all, was the very dispute that the release\nwas supposed to resolve. Therefore, we conclude that the disclaimer of reliance is binding and, as a matter of law, precludes\nthe Swansons' claim that they were fraudulently induced to sell their interest in the sea-diamond project.\n\n *181 [13] In sum, we hold that a release that clearly expresses the parties' intent to waive fraudulent inducement claims, or\none that disclaims reliance on representations about specific matters in dispute, can preclude a claim of fraudulent inducement.\nWe emphasize that a disclaimer of reliance or merger clause will not always bar a fraudulent inducement claim. See Prudential,\n896 S.W.2d at 162 (identifying some circumstances in which “as is” clause would not preclude fraudulent inducement claim).\nWe conclude only that on this record, the disclaimer of reliance conclusively negates as a matter of law the element of\nreliance on representations about the feasibility and value of the sea-diamond mining project needed to support the Swansons'\nclaim of fraudulent inducement. As there is no evidence of a fiduciary or confidential relationship, the trial court correctly\nrendered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict against the Swansons on their claims of breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent\ninducement.\n\n\n\n                                               IV. COMMON–LAW FRAUD\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                          11\n\fSchlumberger Technology Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171 (1997)\n41 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 165\n\nThe Swansons contend that even if the disclaimer of reliance precludes their claim that they were fraudulently induced to sign\nthe release by Schlumberger's affirmative misrepresentations, it does not preclude their claim of fraud by non-disclosure. Under\ncommon-law fraud, the Swansons assert, Schlumberger had an affirmative duty to disclose material information about the sea-\ndiamond project because Schlumberger knew that the Swansons did not have an equal opportunity to discover the information,\nthat the Swansons lacked accurate information on the project's value and feasibility, and that the Swansons were relying on this\ninaccurate information in selling their interests in the project. See Smith v. National Resort Communities, Inc., 585 S.W.2d 655,\n658 (Tex.1979). In addition, the Swansons claim that Schlumberger, having made only partial disclosures that were misleading,\nhad a duty to disclose the whole truth about the value and feasibility of the project. See Spoljaric v. Percival Tours, Inc., 708\nS.W.2d 432, 435 (Tex.1986). The Swansons contend that Schlumberger withheld geologic, economic, and technical information\nthat would have permitted the Swansons to make their own assessment of the sea-diamond project. Again, we assume that\nSchlumberger had a duty to disclose pertinent information and failed to do so.\n\n [14] [15] The Swansons assert that the jury's verdict must be sustained because reliance is not an element of a claim for fraud\nby non-disclosure. We disagree. Reliance is an element of fraud. See Stone v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., 554 S.W.2d 183, 185\n(Tex.1977). Fraud by non-disclosure is simply a subcategory of fraud because, where a party has a duty to disclose, the non-\ndisclosure may be as misleading as a positive misrepresentation of facts. See Smith, 585 S.W.2d at 658.\n\nThe Swansons rely on Johnson, 120 S.W.2d at 787, in which we said that partners owe each other a duty to make full disclosure\nof all material facts within their knowledge relating to partnership affairs. Because of that duty, we held that the issue of\none partner's reliance on the other to discharge that duty to disclose was immaterial. Id. at 788. Johnson is not pertinent\nto our discussion because, as we have said, there is no evidence of a partnership or other confidential relationship between\nSchlumberger and the Swansons.\n\n [16] Even so, the Swansons assert that the disclaimer of reliance is nonetheless immaterial because it does not disclaim reliance\non Schlumberger's non-disclosures; it does not say, for example, that “none of us is relying on Schlumberger for accurate\nreports about the project.” Schlumberger responds that the language of the disclaimer of reliance expressly covers claims for\nboth affirmative statements and non-disclosures. In particular, Schlumberger asserts that the alleged non-disclosures are merely\nthe converse of the misrepresentations; the disclaimer of reliance covers any “non-disclosures” that are the equivalent of the\nrepresentations on which the Swansons disclaimed reliance. We agree with Schlumberger.\n\nIn support of their argument, the Swansons reiterate the evidence that in April 1986 Schlumberger had a report that positively\n *182 assessed the technological and economic feasibility of the sea-diamond project, yet in 1987 and 1988, after Schlumberger\ndecided to withdraw Sedswan from the joint venture, Schlumberger made statements and disclosures to the Swansons indicating\nthat the technology was unworkable and the project would not be commercially feasible. Had Schlumberger disclosed the\ngeological, economic, and technical data available to it, the Swansons contend that they would have been able to make their own\nassessment and determine that there had been no adverse developments since April 1986. In short, had Schlumberger disclosed\nall the true facts about the project, it would not have affirmatively misrepresented the truth. The Swansons' non-disclosure\nallegations are simply the converse of Schlumberger's affirmative misrepresentations and are covered by the disclaimer of\nreliance.\n\n\n\n                          V. SECTION 27.01 OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS & COMMERCE CODE\n\nIn addition to finding breach of fiduciary duty and common-law fraud, the jury found that Schlumberger committed fraud in\nconnection with a real estate transaction in violation of section 27.01 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. TEX. BUS.\n& COM.CODE § 27.01. Schlumberger contends that section 27.01 does not apply to the Swansons' interest in the sea-diamond\nproject. Schlumberger argues that the Swansons' interest at most was an interest in a prospecting lease off the South African\ncoast, which under both South African and Texas law is a personal property interest, and not an interest in real estate.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 165\n\n [17] We need not consider the choice-of-law and applicability issues Schlumberger raises. Nor do we approve or disapprove\nof the court of appeals' discussion on the application and construction of section 27.01 in this case. For our purposes, we assume,\nwithout deciding, that section 27.01 applies to Schlumberger's purchase of the Swansons' interest. Given that assumption, we\nhold that the disclaimer of reliance precludes the Swansons' statutory fraud claim.\n\nAs with the common law, reliance is a necessary element of a statutory fraud claim under section 27.01. TEX. BUS. &\nCOM.CODE § 27.01(a)(1)(B). As is clear from our previous discussion, the disclaimer of reliance in this case conclusively\nnegates the Swansons' allegation that they relied on misrepresentations about commercial feasibility and value by Schlumberger\nin selling their interest in the sea-diamond project. The trial court's judgment notwithstanding the verdict was in all respects\nproper.\n\n******\n\nWe reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment that the Swansons take nothing.\n\n\n\nOWEN, J., not sitting.\n\nParallel Citations\n\n41 Tex.

Lessor also asserted a third-\nparty claim. Lessee and third-party filed motion to enforce settlement agreement. Lessor moved to continue the hearing on\nmotion to enforce. The 16th District Court, Denton County, Carmen Rivera-Worley, J., recessed the hearing, ordered parties to\nreturn to mediation, and awarded lessee and third-party attorney fees. After mediation failed, lessee and third-party reasserted\nclaims and added claim for breach of the memorandum of settlement.

Scott, as Trustee of the Thomas Eugene Scott,\nJr. Living Trust, and Allison L. Scott, as Trustee of the Allison L. Scott Trust (“Appellants,” if jointly) appeal from an order\ngranting an amended motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Appellants and Appellees Diana Taffarello and Robert\nL. Soltis (“Appellees,” if jointly). In five issues, Appellants complain that the trial court erred as a matter of law by granting\nthe amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement, that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their request for\na jury trial and by awarding attorneys' fees to Appellees, and that the filing of a notice of settlement constitutes an unlawful\ntaking of property in violation of the United States and Texas Constitutions. We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                   II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nTaffarello filed her original plaintiff's petition on January 29, 2004. Taffarello alleged that she had entered into a real property\nlease with Appellants and that Appellants later agreed to sell her the leased property. According to the petition, however,\nAppellants subsequently advised Taffarello that they would not sell the property to her. In addition to seeking a declaratory\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                3\n\fScott-Richter v. Taffarello, 186 S.W.3d 182 (2006)\n\n\njudgment regarding her right to continued possession of the property, Taffarello asserted claims for breach of the real estate\ncontract, fraud, and breach of a lease agreement. Appellants answered Taffarello's petition and asserted a third-party claim\nagainst Soltis.\n\nThe parties went to mediation on July 14, 2004 and agreed to a number of terms as evidenced in a written Memorandum\nof *185 Settlement (“Memorandum”). The Memorandum, among other things, indicates that Taffarello's lawsuit is to be\ndismissed, describes how the net proceeds of the sale are to be divided after the property is sold, provides for the drafting of\na “compromise settlement agreement” and “trust agreement,” and designates a settlement closing date of August 13, 2004,\nwhich the parties later agreed to extend by two weeks. In mid-August, counsel for Appellants allegedly advised Taffarello that\nthey would no longer negotiate regarding the settlement documents. Appellants' counsel also filed a motion to withdraw and\na motion to abate the case.\n\nAppellees responded with a letter dated August 24, 2004, which demanded that Appellants engage in good faith negotiations\nin regard to the remaining settlement documents and that the parties return to mediation. Appellees received no response to the\nletter, and consequently, the parties were unable to reach an agreement regarding the preparation of the additional documents\ncontemplated by the Memorandum. As such, the parties did not close on the designated date, and Appellees filed a motion to\nenforce the settlement agreement on September 17, 2004; they amended the motion on October 7.\n\nAppellees' amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement requested that the trial court declare, among other things, that\nthe Memorandum is a binding Rule 11 settlement agreement, 1 that the “Compromise and Settlement Agreement” attached to\nthe motion is the compromise settlement agreement specified in the Memorandum, that the “Cole Richter Irrevocable Trust\nAgreement” also attached to the motion is the trust instrument specified in the Memorandum, and that the “Notice of Settlement”\nattached to the motion is “proper and appropriate.”\n\nOn October 13, 2004, the trial court heard arguments on the pending motions, which included a motion filed by Appellants to\ncontinue the hearing on the motion to enforce because of their attorney's pending motion to withdraw. The trial court ultimately\ngranted Appellants' counsel's motion to withdraw, recessed the hearing on the amended motion to enforce the settlement\nagreement until a later date, ordered the parties to return to mediation, and awarded Appellees $5,000 in attorneys' fees.\n\nThe parties returned to mediation but were unable to reach a compromise regarding the terms of the Memorandum calling for\nfurther agreement. On November 15, 2004, Appellees filed their first amended petition and third-party defendant counterclaims,\nwhich, in addition to re-asserting claims for breach of the real estate contract and lease agreement, asserted a claim for breach\nof the Memorandum. On November 19, 2004, the parties entered into a second Rule 11 agreement, which partially provided:\n\n            We have agreed that your clients, Allison Scott, a/k/a Allison Scott–Richter, individually, and as Trustee\n            of the Thomas Eugene Scott, Jr., Living Trust, and as Trustee of the Allison L. Scott Trust (collectively,\n            “Scott”), will not challenge the validity or enforceability of the Memorandum of Settlement dated July\n            14, 2004 (the “Memorandum”) by and between Scott and Diana Taffarello (“Taffarello”) and Robert\n            Soltis, Jr. (“Soltis”). In particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Scott agrees not\n            to raise lack of competency, duress, lack of essential term(s), tax effect or consequences, violation of\n            any other trust, or any other matter as a *186 bar or defense to the Memorandum. Scott further agrees\n            that she will not challenge or contest the Amended Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement filed by\n            Taffarello and Soltis. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\nNotwithstanding this language, Appellants filed a request for a jury trial on December 14, 2004. The trial court heard the\namended motion to enforce the settlement agreement three days later on December 17, and despite Appellants' arguments that\nthey were entitled to a jury trial on Taffarello's breach of contract claim, the trial court granted the motion to enforce.\n\nAppellants filed a motion for new trial on January 18, 2005, which the trial court subsequently denied. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                            4\n\fScott-Richter v. Taffarello, 186 S.W.3d 182 (2006)\n\n\n\n\n                                                      III. JURISDICTION\n\nWe begin our analysis by determining whether we have jurisdiction to consider this matter. Appellees assert that this appeal\nshould be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Appellants' notice of appeal was not timely filed. We disagree.\n\n [1] The trial court signed its final judgment on December 17, 2004. Appellants timely filed a motion for new trial; therefore,\nAppellants' notice of appeal was due on or before March 17, 2005. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 26.1(a)(1). On March 30, 2005, Appellants\nfiled their notice of appeal with the District Clerk of Denton County, Texas. On April 6, 2005, we notified Appellants of our\nconcern that the notice of appeal was not timely filed. We informed Appellants that if we did not receive a response from them\nwithin twelve days showing a reasonable explanation for the late filing of the notice of appeal, the appeal could be dismissed for\nwant of jurisdiction. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 10.5(b), 26.3(b), 42.3(a); Jones v. City of Houston, 976 S.W.2d 676, 677 (Tex.1998);\nVerburgt v. Dorner, 959 S.W.2d 615, 617 (Tex.1997).\n\nAppellants responded by filing a motion for extension of time to file their notice of appeal. Because Appellants' motion was\nnot filed within fifteen days of the date the notice of appeal was due, we were not authorized to grant the motion, and we took\nno action on the motion. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 26.3. However, inasmuch as Appellants filed their notice of appeal with the proper\ntrial court clerk within fifteen days of the due date, a motion for extension of time was necessarily implied. See Verburgt, 959\nS.W.2d at 617 (holding a motion for extension of time is necessarily implied when an appellant acting in good faith files a\ndocument attempting to perfect the appeal beyond the time allowed by the appellate rules, but within the fifteen-day period in\nwhich the appellant would be entitled to move to extend the filing deadline).\n\nAccordingly, we construed Appellants' motion as a response to our April 6, 2005 letter questioning our jurisdiction.\nConsequently, the question before us was whether Appellants provided a reasonable explanation for the late filing of their\nnotice of appeal within the fifteen-day period of Rule 26.3. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 26.3; Hone v. Hanafin, 104 S.W.3d 884, 886–87\n(Tex.2003); Jones, 976 S.W.2d at 677;Verburgt, 959 S.W.2d at 617. Appellants explained that their failure to timely file their\nnotice of appeal was not deliberate or intentional, but was the result of inadvertence, mistake, or mischance in the calculation of\nthe deadline and the mis-docketing of such date on the calendar of Appellants' counsel. On April 18, 2005, we issued an order\nfinding that Appellants had provided a reasonable explanation for the late filing of their notice of appeal.\n\n *187 Appellees filed a motion asking us to reconsider our order. Appellees asserted that the notice of appeal was not timely\nfiled, and they further contended that this appeal must be dismissed because the body of Appellants' notice of appeal recites,\n“This appeal is taken to the Fifth Court of Appeals of the State of Texas in Dallas, Texas.”\n\nOn May 9, 2005, we denied Appellees' motion for reconsideration and permitted Appellants ten days to file an amended notice\nof appeal reciting that they were appealing to the Court of Appeals for the Second District of Texas. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 25.1(d)\n(4), (f) (providing that an “amended notice of appeal correcting a defect or omission in an earlier filed notice may be filed in the\nappellate court”), TEX.R.APP. P. 44.3 (“A court of appeals must not ... dismiss an appeal for formal defects or irregularities\nin appellate procedure without allowing a reasonable time to correct or amend the defects or irregularities.”); Maxfield v.\nTerry, 888 S.W.2d 809, 811 (Tex.1994) (holding that if an appellant makes a bona fide attempt to invoke the jurisdiction of\nthe appellate court, the appellant must be permitted to file an amended notice of appeal); Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Estate of\nGonzalez, 820 S.W.2d 121, 121–22 (Tex.1991) (“[T]he decisions of the courts of appeals [should] turn on substance rather\nthan procedural technicality.”). Appellants timely filed an amended notice of appeal that complied with the requisites of Rule\n25.1(d). SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 25.1(d).\n\n\nAccordingly, we hold that Appellants offered a reasonable explanation for the late filing of their notice of appeal, 2 which they\ntimely amended, and we have jurisdiction over this appeal. 3\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Taffarello, 186 S.W.3d 182 (2006)\n\n\n\n\n                                              IV. REQUEST FOR JURY TRIAL\n\n [2] In their first issue, Appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their request for a jury trial. They\ncontend that their demand for a jury trial was timely and that their federal constitutional rights under the Seventh Amendment\nto the United States Constitution, their state constitutional rights under Article 5, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution, and\ntheir statutory rights under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 216 were violated. Appellees respond that Appellants' request for a\njury trial pertains only to Appellees' breach of contract claim, which was abandoned by Appellees and dismissed by the order\ngranting the amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement and final judgment. We agree.\n\nAppellants argued repeatedly during the hearing on the amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement that they were\nentitled to a jury trial on Appellees' breach of contract (Memorandum) claim. Counsel for Appellants argued,\n\n             In that First Amended Petition ... Mr. Spoede asserted a claim for breach of contract of the Settlement\n             Agreement and a claim for declaratory judgment. Both of those claims are claims that under *188 Article\n             5, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution, these defendants are entitled to a trial by jury on those claims.\n\nCounsel continued,\n\n  [I]f the Court construes, and we believe the Court cannot reach any other conclusion but that there are still two breaches\n  of Settlement Agreement—two causes of action still outstanding, then this matter needs to go ahead and proceed to trial in\n  February as the Court currently has it set.\n\n  ....\n\n  [I]f they are asserting a claim for breach of contract, they're required to prove the breach of contract.... My clients have\n  the right, based on the current state of the pleadings, to do discovery on this claim of breach of contract and declaratory\n  judgment, to call witnesses, to have documents produced, to take depositions, and most important, to try to have a jury trial\n  in connection with this.\n\nFinally, counsel argued,\n\n             We believe that the Court ought to set this matter for trial, that Ms. Scott and the remaining defendants\n             ought to be allowed the opportunity as they are given the right under the Texas Constitution to defend\n             against the claims of breach of contract and the declaratory judgment claims....\n\nCounsel for Appellees, however, responded that they were withdrawing the breach of contract claim. He said,\n\n             Once he [opposing counsel] signed the Rule 11 Agreement saying that he wouldn't oppose our Amended\n             Motion to Enforce, it made everything moot. Everything settled except for the issue of attorney's fees.\n             So to the extent we do have other—the same claims couched as other causes of action, we withdraw\n             those causes of action because [the trial court's] order gives us all the relief we were seeking in the first\n             place. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court, in response to a question by Appellants regarding the effect of the order as it\nrelates to the breach of contract claim, stated it understood that Appellees were “abandoning or waiving many of those claims.”\nCounsel for Appellees responded that the order “speaks for itself.” Indeed, the order signed by the trial court provides that\n“[a]ny claims in this lawsuit that are not specifically addressed in this Order and Judgment, including all claims, counter-claims,\ncross-claims, and third-party claims, are dismissed with prejudice to the refiling of same.”\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               6\n\fScott-Richter v. Taffarello, 186 S.W.3d 182 (2006)\n\n\nOur review of the order indicates that it does not address Appellees' breach of contract claim, specifically or as part of its\ndeclarations. Thus, because Appellees withdrew their breach of contract claim during the hearing and because the order granting\nthe amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement expressly dismisses the breach of contract claim, Appellants' argument\nthat they are entitled to a jury trial on Appellees' breach of contract claim is moot. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 47.1; Williams v. Lara,\n52 S.W.3d 171, 184 (Tex.2000) (reasoning that case is moot if live controversy ceases to exist); In re Guardianship of Keller,\n171 S.W.3d 498, 500 (Tex.App.-Waco 2005, pet. filed) (reasoning that appellate courts lack jurisdiction to consider issues\nthat have been rendered moot). Moreover, to the extent Appellants' argument can be interpreted as challenging the denial of\na jury trial on the declaratory judgment claims as violative of Article 5, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution and the Seventh\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, the record reflects that Appellants agreed by the November 19, 2004 Rule 11\nagreement not to challenge or contest the amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement, *189 which the order tracks\nsubstantially verbatim. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellants' request for a jury trial.\nWe overrule Appellants' first issue.\n\n\n\n                                V. AMENDED MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT\n                                AGREEMENT AND CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES\n\nIn their second issue, Appellants argue that the trial court erred as a matter of law by granting the amended motion to enforce\nthe settlement agreement because it had the effect of imposing additional material terms to the agreement that the parties had\nyet to negotiate and agree upon. Appellants contend that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that they agreed to be\nbound by the compromise settlement agreement, trust agreement, and notice of settlement and that the issue of whether they\nagreed to be bound by the terms of these agreements should have been set for a jury trial. In their third issue, Appellants argue\n—without citing any authority—that the denial of their right to a jury trial on these issues denied them due process under the\nTexas and federal constitutions and constituted an unlawful taking of property under the Fifth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. In their fourth issue, Appellants argue—without citing any authority-that the filing of the “Notice of Settlement”\nin Denton County results in an unconstitutional taking of property. Appellees respond that the November 19, 2004 Rule 11\nagreement resolved any dispute as to the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the documents drafted to effectuate\nit. We agree.\n\n [3] [4] [5] Pursuant to Rule 11, no agreement between the parties or their attorneys shall be enforceable unless the agreement\nis either (1) in writing, signed by the parties, and filed with the papers as part of the record or (2) made orally in open court\nand entered as part of the record. TEX.R. CIV. P. 11. Rule 11 aims to eradicate the misunderstandings and controversies\ncommonly associated with verbal agreements among parties and counsel. Padilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454, 460 (Tex.1995).\nAgreements in writing and filed with the court allow the writings to “speak for themselves” so that “the court can judge of their\nimport, and proceed to act upon them with safety.” Id. A trial court has a ministerial duty to enforce a valid Rule 11 agreement.\nExxonMobil Corp. v. Valence Operating Co., 174 S.W.3d 303, 309 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. filed).\n\n [6] Here, the clerk's record contains a “Notice of Filing of Rule 11 Agreement.” The document states that it “is an enforceable\nagreement under Rule 11 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,” contains the signatures of both Appellants' and Appellees'\nattorneys, and was filed with the trial court as part of the record on December 8, 2004. Dated November 19, 2004, the agreement\nstates that Scott 4 “agrees that she will not challenge or contest the Amended Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement filed\nby Taffarello and Soltis.” [Emphasis added.] We hold that the attorneys, on behalf of their clients, entered into a valid Rule 11\nAgreement that the trial court had a ministerial duty to enforce. SeeTEX.R. CIV. P. 11; ExxonMobil Corp., 174 S.W.3d at 309.\n\n [7] The amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement that Appellants agreed not to contest sought a declaration\nby the trial court that the Memorandum entered into by the parties on July 14, 2004 is a binding and enforceable Rule\n11 *190 settlement agreement; that the “Compromise and Settlement Agreement” attached to the amended motion as exhibit\n“B” constitutes the compromise settlement agreement specified in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum; that the “Cole Richter\nIrrevocable Trust Agreement” attached to the amended motion as exhibit “C” is the trust instrument or agreement specified in\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             7\n\fScott-Richter v. Taffarello, 186 S.W.3d 182 (2006)\n\n\nparagraphs 4 and 5 of the Memorandum; and that the “Notice of Settlement” attached to the amended motion as exhibit “D”\nis “proper and appropriate” and may be filed in the real property records of Denton County, Texas. Despite the valid Rule 11\nagreement entered into by the parties, Appellants now attempt to challenge the “Compromise and Settlement Agreement,” the\n“Cole Richter Irrevocable Trust Agreement,” and the “Notice of Settlement” by arguing that they never agreed to the terms\ncontained therein and by arguing that their rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions have been denied. This\nthey cannot do. Appellants expressly agreed not to challenge the amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement. By so\nagreeing, they foreclosed their ability to complain on appeal regarding the terms of the motion and subsequent order granting\nthe same. As Appellees state in their brief,\n\n            By executing the Nov. 19 Rule 11 Agreement, counsel resolved the very issues he now attempts to\n            challenge in this appeal: the enforceability of the mediated settlement agreement and the documents\n            drafted to effectuate it.... Moreover, the amended motion to enforce incorporates each of the documents\n            Scott now claims go beyond the settlement agreement. Appellants agreed to each one by agreeing not\n            to contest the amended motion to enforce.\n\n\nThe trial court's order granting Appellees' motion to enforce the settlement agreement and final judgment tracks the language\nin the motion closely and states,\n\n  1. The Memorandum of Settlement entered into by the parties and dated July 14, 2004, is declared to be a binding and effective\n  settlement agreement that is enforceable under contract law and under Rule 11of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure....\n\n  2....

The Cole Richter Irrevocable Trust Agreement is hereby declared to be that trust instrument or agreement specified\n  or referenced in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Memorandum of Settlement, and in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Compromise and\n  Settlement Agreement, and shall be fully enforceable and effective as if properly signed and executed by each of the parties....\n\n  4.

Accordingly, because Appellants agreed not to challenge or contest the\namended motion to enforce the settlement agreement pursuant to a *191 valid Rule 11 agreement, the trial court did not err by\nperforming its ministerial duty and granting Appellees' amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement. SeeTEX.R. CIV.\nP. 11; ExxonMobil Corp., 174 S.W.3d at 309;see also Childers v. King Ranch, Inc., No. 13–03–006–CV, 2005 WL 774512,\nat *5 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi April 7, 2005, no pet.) (mem.op.)

ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\nIn their fifth issue, Appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding Appellees attorneys' fees. Appellants\ncontend that the trial court should not have considered Appellees' request for attorneys' fees because Appellants were without\nlegal representation at the time of the award, the award was premature, and Appellants were entitled to a jury trial on the issue\nof attorneys' fees.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Taffarello, 186 S.W.3d 182 (2006)\n\n\n [8] We initially note that Appellants failed to present any of these arguments during the October 13, 2004 hearing at which the\ntrial court awarded Appellees attorneys' fees; thus, they failed to put the trial court on notice of their objections to the award.\nSeeTEX.R.APP. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A). After counsel for Appellees requested $5,000 in attorneys' fees, the trial court asked for a\nresponse from Appellants' counsel, who stated, “Well, obviously, we oppose that.” The trial court indicated thereafter that it was\nawarding Appellees the attorneys' fees. Appellants also fail to cite one single authority for each of the three arguments raised\nin their brief. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 38.1(h). Accordingly, Appellants failed to preserve these arguments for appellate review.\n\n [9] Nonetheless, Appellants' arguments are unpersuasive. Appellants were not without counsel at the time the trial court\nawarded Appellees attorneys' fees. The record clearly indicates that the trial court awarded Appellees attorneys' fees before\ngranting Appellants' counsel's motion to withdraw. Moreover, as demonstrated above, the trial court afforded Appellants an\nopportunity to argue against the request for attorneys' fees. Regarding Appellants' prematurity argument, the trial court had\ntwo subsequent opportunities to consider the award; Appellants filed their “Motion for Reconsideration or to Set Aside Order\nGranting Attorney's Fees” on December 16, 2004 and motion for new trial on January 18, 2005. The trial court ultimately\nupheld the award of attorneys' fees. Appellants lastly argue that they are entitled to a jury trial on the issue of attorneys' fees\nbecause “the right to such recovery was necessarily predicated upon Appellees' successful prosecution of their claims that the\nMemorandum was an enforceable agreement and that the Appellants had breached it.” However, as we discussed in Section IV\nabove, Appellees waived their breach of contract claim in open court, and the order granting their amended motion to enforce\nthe settlement agreement expressly dismisses all claims not addressed in the order, which includes Appellees' breach of contract\nclaim. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Appellees attorneys' fees. Accordingly, we overrule\nAppellants' fifth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                           VII. CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled all of Appellants' issues, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      TEX.R. CIV. P. 11.\n2      On appeal, Appellees do not challenge the reasonableness of Appellants' explanation for the late filing of their notice of appeal. See\n        Hone, 104 S.W.3d at 886–87 (discussing what constitutes a reasonable explanation for late filing of a notice of appeal).\n3       Appellees' brief states that Appellants filed a motion for extension of time to file their notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals for\n        the Fifth District of Texas, which refused to act. Our record does not contain any such motion, but even if it did, the motion would\n        not have any significance in our decision that Appellants offered a reasonable explanation for the filing of their notice of appeal with\n        the proper trial court clerk within fifteen days of the due date.\n4       In the agreement, Scott refers to Appellants, i.e., Scott in all of her capacities.\n\n\n End of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because the procedural posture defines the parameters of the issues before\nthis Court, we will describe the history of this dispute in detail.\n\nAt the core of this controversy is the proper construction of section 102.52 of the Alcoholic Beverage Code as amended by the\n73rd Legislature in 1993. Before its amendment, the section provided:\n\n             (a) Nothing in Section 102.51 of this code limits or alters the right of a holder of a general, local, or\n             branch distributor's license to sell beer to any other holder of a general, local, or branch distributor's\n             license, except that a distributor who has purchased beer from another distributor may distribute and\n             sell the beer only within a territory for which the manufacturer of the brand has designated that it may\n             be sold by a distributor.\n\nAct of March 29, 1979, 66th Leg., R.S., ch. 33, § 9, 1979 Tex.Gen.Laws 53, 55 (Tex.Alco.Bev.Code Ann. § 102.52(a), since\namended) (emphasis added).\n\nIn 1993, the Legislature amended the last portion of the section to read “except that a distributor who has purchased beer from\nanother distributor may distribute and sell the beer only within a territory for which the manufacturer of the brand has designated\nthat it may be sold by the general, local, or branch distributor making the purchase.” Act of May 30, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S.,\nch. 934, § 67, 1993 Tex.Gen.Laws 3950, 3975 (Tex.Alco.Bev.Code Ann. § 102.52) (emphasis added). Ruiz and the TABC\ndispute whether this amendment to section 102.52 now requires local beer distributors to have territorial agreements with beer\nmanufacturers before such distributors can resell beer purchased from another distributor.\n\nOn September 28, 1993, Ruiz filed suit for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the TABC. Ruiz alleged\nentitlement to a temporary injunction enjoining the TABC from enforcing section 102.52 on four grounds: (1) procedural\ninvalidity for noncompliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and due-course-of-law provision of the Texas Constitution\nwhen the TABC announced its intent to enforce the section, (2) violation of constitutional rights to due process and equal\nprotection, (3) inconsistency with other sections of the Alcoholic Beverage Code, and (4) lack of authority for the TABC to\nenact an unconstitutional rule.\n\nOn October 18, 1993, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Ruiz's application for temporary injunction. In its first\norder, dated January 20, 1994, the court found section 102.52 ambiguous and construed it as not requiring local beer distributors\nto obtain manufacturers' territorial agreements. Concluding there was a probable right to recover on the merits, the court issued\na temporary injunction against TABC enforcement of the provision. The TABC timely perfected an appeal from this order in\nour cause number 3–93–618–CV.\n\n\nSilver Eagle Distributors, Inc. (“Silver Eagle”), an intervenor below, did not appeal this initial order by the trial court. 2 Rather,\nSilver Eagle filed a motion for rehearing, which the trial court granted. In a second order, dated January 27, 1994, the court\ndetermined that the temporary injunction should not have been issued because the court's preliminary interpretation of amended\nsection 102.52 was incorrect. The court concluded that section 102.52 “requires that when a distributor (the ‘purchasing\ndistributor’) purchases beer from another distributor, the purchasing distributor may only resell that beer in the territory assigned\nto the purchasing distributor by the manufacturer of the beer.” The court dissolved the temporary injunction it had issued only the\nweek before. Significantly, Ruiz did not appeal this January 27, 1994 order dissolving the temporary injunction and construing\nsection 102.52. Meanwhile, the TABC's appeal from the trial court's first order remained pending in this Court.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Ruiz Wholesale Co., 901 S.W.2d 772 (1995)\n\n\n\n\n *775 On January 31, 1994, the TABC issued a letter notifying all holders of general and local distributors' licenses of the trial\ncourt's January 27, 1994 order. This notification letter, which included a copy of the trial court's order, simply stated that the\norder was “self-explanatory” and advised distributors to “make sure that you are in compliance with the law.”\n\nOn March 28, 1994, Ruiz filed in the trial court a second application for temporary injunctive relief. This second request\nreiterated all of the grounds asserted in Ruiz's initial application and also included three claims that were essentially new: (1) the\nrequirement of territorial agreements constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of power to beer wholesalers; (2) the requirement\nis an unconstitutional suspension of law; and (3) territorial agreements operate as an unreasonable restraint violating the Texas\nAntitrust Act. 3 Following another hearing, the trial court, in an order dated May 10, 1994, denied Ruiz's second application for\ntemporary injunctive relief on the grounds that Ruiz had failed to show probable right to recover and probable injury. Further, the\ncourt found that claims of adverse action by the TABC were not ripe for consideration. Finally, the court expressed no opinion\n“on the alleged absence of standards to guide the discretion of the licensing authority in the implementation or application of\nSection 102.52.” Ruiz perfected an interlocutory appeal from this May 10, 1994 order in our cause number 3–94–269–CV.\n\n\n\n                                                          DISCUSSION\n\nIn its first point of error, Ruiz asserts that the trial court adopted an erroneous construction of section 102.52 of the Alcoholic\nBeverage Code. Given the procedural history described above, it is imperative that we identify precisely the issues that are\nproperly before this Court in these interlocutory appeals.\n\n\nA. January 20, 1994 Order Granting Temporary Injunction\n [1] The TABC properly appealed the validity of the initial January 20, 1994 order granting Ruiz a temporary injunction.\nHowever, the trial court subsequently granted a rehearing and, in its January 27, 1994 order, dissolved the injunction. The issue\nof whether an injunction is valid becomes moot when the injunction ceases to have effect. University Interscholastic League v.\nBuchanan, 848 S.W.2d 298, 304 (Tex.App.—Austin 1993, no writ). Because the trial court dissolved the temporary injunction\non rehearing, the TABC's appeal of the January 20, 1994 order is moot. We lack jurisdiction when an appeal is moot. See id.\n\n\nB. January 27, 1994 Order Dissolving Temporary Injunction\n [2] When the trial court reconsidered its temporary injunction, it renounced its earlier interpretation of section 102.52 and\nconcluded that the statute requires that all purchasing distributors, including local distributors, have manufacturers' territorial\nagreements. Consequently, the court dissolved the previously granted temporary injunction. This order constituted a denial of\ntemporary injunctive relief, from which Ruiz did not appeal. An interlocutory order that is not timely appealed is not reviewable\nby this Court. See Desai v. Reliance Mach. Works, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ);\nCellular Mktg., Inc. v. Houston Cellular Tel. Co., 784 S.W.2d 734, 735 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, no writ); Tober\nv. Turner of Texas, Inc., 668 S.W.2d 831, 833–34 (Tex.App.—Austin 1984, no writ). Although Ruiz argues vigorously that\nthe trial court did not correctly construe section 102.52 in its January 27, 1994 order, Ruiz's failure to perfect an interlocutory\nappeal from that order precludes this Court from reviewing its validity.\n\n\nC. May 10, 1994 Order Denying Second Request for Temporary Injunction\nAfter the time to appeal the dissolution of the previously granted temporary injunction had passed, Ruiz filed a second\napplication for temporary injunctive relief. Following *776 another evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied this second\nrequest. Ruiz perfected an interlocutory appeal from this May 10, 1994 order.\n\nIn points of error two and three, Ruiz asserts that the trial court erred in “refusing to restrain the TABC's enforcement of its\ninterpretation of section 102.52” and in “refusing to enjoin the application of section 102.52.” However, in the subparts of these\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                5\n\fState v. Ruiz Wholesale Co., 901 S.W.2d 772 (1995)\n\n\narguments, Ruiz directly challenges only one aspect of the trial court's May 10, 1994 decision: “ripeness.” The remainder of\nRuiz's contentions focus on the merits of whether the TABC “rules” are: procedurally and substantively invalid, violative of\ndue process and equal protection, an improper delegation of authority, an invalid suspension of law, an invalid special law, 4\nand violative of the Texas Antitrust Act. Because of Ruiz's misconception of the scope of a second request for injunctive relief\nand the appropriate standard of review in this interlocutory appeal, the issues we must address are considerably narrowed.\n\n\n1. Scope of a Second Request for Injunctive Relief\n [3] [4] Ordinarily, the dissolution of a temporary injunction bars a second application for such injunctive relief, unless the\nsecond request is based on changed circumstances not known at the time of the first application. See Ellis v. Lamb–McAshan Co.,\n278 S.W. 858, 862 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1925, writ dism'd); Birchfield v. Bourland, 187 S.W. 422, 425 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nFort Worth 1916, no writ); see also 43A C.J.S. Injunctions § 278 (1978). Successive applications for injunctive relief on grounds\nthat could have been raised in connection with an earlier request for such relief are not allowed where there is insufficient\nreason why the grounds were not urged in the earlier application. Ellis, 278 S.W. at 862. This restriction on the scope of\nsuccessive requests for the extraordinary remedy of a temporary injunction sensibly deters piecemeal litigation, conserves\njudicial resources, and prohibits litigants from receiving “two bites at the apple.” Cf. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835.\n\n [5] Ruiz's second application for temporary injunction provides no valid basis on which the trial court could have granted\nrelief. The challenges to the procedural and substantive validity of the requirement and the constitutional due process and equal\nprotection arguments in Ruiz's second request duplicate those in its initial request. Moreover, all of the “new grounds” alleged\nin the second application—improper delegation of power, invalid suspension of law, and violation of the Texas Antitrust Act\n—were clearly available to Ruiz when it made its initial request for injunctive relief. Consequently, there is no basis on which\nthe trial court could have abused its discretion in denying Ruiz's second request.\n\n [6] Additionally, there are no changed circumstances that would allow Ruiz to reurge its request for an injunction or generate\nnew grounds for relief. The only thing that occurred between the dissolution of the injunction and Ruiz's second request was the\nTABC notification letter. 5 This brief notice merely informed beer distributors that the previous injunction had been dissolved\nand that distributors should comply with section 102.52. This in no way amounts to a change in circumstances warranting a\nsecond attempt at injunctive relief. Throughout the proceedings, the TABC consistently maintained that section 102.52 required\nall beer distributors to have manufacturers' territorial agreements before purchasing beer from *777 another distributor for\nresale. A letter restating this position is not a changed circumstance, nor was it unknown at the time of the initial application.\nIt does not, therefore, permit a second request for an injunction. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Ruiz's second request.\n\n\n2. Review of a Denial of a Temporary Injunction\n [7] [8] An equally fundamental misconception also pervades Ruiz's appeal. This is an appeal of an interlocutory order.\nAppellate review of an order denying a temporary injunction is strictly limited to a determination of whether there has been a\nclear abuse of discretion. Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex.1978). We must confine our review to abuse of discretion\nand cannot give full consideration to the merits of the underlying lawsuit. Id. at 861–62. A trial court abuses its discretion only\nwhen it acts in an unreasonable and arbitrary manner, or when it acts without reference to any guiding principles. Beaumont\nBank, N.A. v. Buller, 806 S.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex.1991); Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42\n(Tex.1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2279, 90 L.Ed.2d 721 (1986).\n\nRuiz fails to recognize the abuse-of-discretion standard that controls this appeal. Rather, the entire thrust of Ruiz's argument\ngoes to the merits of its many challenges to section 102.52 and its enforcement by the TABC. We decline to reach the merits of\nthese claims without allowing the trial court an opportunity to render a final judgment on them. The sole issue on review here\nis whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Ruiz's second request for injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Ruiz Wholesale Co., 901 S.W.2d 772 (1995)\n\n\n [9] [10] [11] Moreover, even if the present appeal were from the trial court's initial refusal to grant injunctive relief, Ruiz\nwould still not be entitled to a reversal on this record. To prevail in its request for a temporary injunction, Ruiz had to demonstrate\na probable right to recover at trial on the merits and probable injury in the interim. See Sun Oil Co. v. Whitaker, 424 S.W.2d\n216, 218 (Tex.1968). In reviewing an order denying a temporary injunction, we must draw all legitimate inferences from the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order. Hartwell's Office World, Inc. v. Systex Corp., 598 S.W.2d 636,\n638 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see W.C. Larock, D.C., P.C. v. Enabnit, 812 S.W.2d 670, 671\n(Tex.App.—El Paso 1991, no writ). When no findings of fact or conclusions of law are filed, the trial court's order must be\nupheld on any legal theory supported by the record. Davis, 571 S.W.2d at 862.\n\n [12] In its May 10, 1994 order, the trial court found that the second request for injunctive relief should be denied because, inter\nalia, the evidence presented was insufficient to show probable injury. At the hearing on its second request, Ruiz offered the\ntestimony of only one witness, Reecie Dunn, a local distributor. Dunn testified that the TABC had not cited him or threatened\nhim with any action for failure to have a territorial agreement.\n\n\nThe only other evidence admitted at the hearing consisted of two letters from beer manufacturers to Mary Boggs. 6 The first,\nfrom Miller Brewing Company, dated January 28, 1994, responds to a January 26, 1994 inquiry by stating that Miller was aware\nof the court ruling but was unable to respond to “your request” until the TABC informs the company what manufacturers can\nand cannot do. Given that it is unclear what the request was and whether the court ruling mentioned was the initial January 20,\n1994 order or later January 27, 1994 order, this is not conclusive evidence of probable injury.\n\nThe second letter, from Anheuser–Busch, also dated January 28, 1994, merely states that the company already has a contractual\nagreement granting an exclusive territorial agreement to another distributor. Given this paucity of evidence, the trial court\ncertainly did not abuse its discretion when it refused to find probable injury.\n\n\n\n                                                          *778 CONCLUSION\n\nWe dismiss the TABC's appeal in cause number 3–93–618–CV as moot, because the trial court has dissolved the injunction\nfrom which the appeal was taken. In cause number 3–94–269–CV, we overrule Ruiz's points of error and affirm the trial-court\norder denying Ruiz's second application for an injunction. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying this relief,\nboth because Ruiz was not entitled to seek successive injunctive relief and because Ruiz failed to carry its burden of proof\non probable injury.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      The Ruiz Wholesale Co. litigants also include: Ruiz Wholesale Co.

In three issues, TxDOT complains that the district court erred in denying its plea to the jurisdiction\nbecause (1) Sunset Valley lacks standing to sue for the physical taking of its streets, (2) Sunset Valley lacks standing to sue for\nany injuries that may result from the increased circuity of travel and noise and light pollution caused by the highway's expansion,\nand (3) TxDOT is immune from suit by virtue of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

This dispute arose when *729 TxDOT expanded U.S. Highway 290 from a small ground-level highway into a multi-\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

City of Sunset Valley, 8 S.W.3d 727 (1999)\n\n\nlevel, limited-access divided highway. As a result of TxDOT's decision to make Highway 290 a controlled-access highway\nalong the length of Sunset Valley, several streets that had previously crossed or run alongside the old ground-level highway\nwere affected. Jones Road, an important municipal artery, was one of the streets affected, and a substantial portion of it had to\nbe closed. This street had served as a vital transportation link that the residents of Sunset Valley, as well as its police officers and\nother emergency personnel, had used to commute between the central and southwestern portions of the city. After the closure,\ntravel between the two portions was possible only by traveling along Highway 290's access road to a point outside the city,\ncrossing under, and then doubling back along the opposite side of Highway 290.\n\nSunset Valley has since found it necessary to construct a substitute street in order to regain the transportation connection it lost\nas a result of the expansion. The question of who should pay for this substitute street, along with a multitude of other issues\ninvolved in the construction and completion of Highway 290, was presented to the district court. Sunset Valley also raised\nissues of noise and light pollution, charging that TxDOT had failed to perform state and federally mandated noise-abatement\nprocedures and studies. Sunset Valley moved for partial, interlocutory summary judgment, and TxDOT responded by filing a\nplea to the jurisdiction along with several special exceptions to Sunset Valley's pleadings. The district court denied TxDOT's\nplea and special exceptions and granted Sunset Valley's motion for partial, interlocutory summary judgment on November 9,\n1998. The court found that Sunset Valley proved all the elements of inverse condemnation as a matter of law and that the\nsubstitute facilities doctrine was the proper method of determining the amount of damages incurred by Sunset Valley. The trial\ncourt also found that Sunset Valley was entitled to declaratory relief with respect to its noise pollution claims, but that it was\nnot entitled to relief in the form of an injunction or mandamus. TxDOT now challenges the district court's denial of its plea to\nthe jurisdiction in this interlocutory appeal, arguing (1) that Sunset Valley lacks standing to sue for inverse condemnation, (2)\nthat Sunset Valley lacks standing to bring its claims for damages resulting from increased circuity of travel and noise and light\npollution, and (3) that TxDOT is immune from suit for declaratory relief by virtue of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n\n\n\n                                                           DISCUSSION\n\nInterlocutory Appeal\n [1] [2] [3] [4] In bringing this appeal, TxDOT must of necessity rely solely on section 51.014(a)(8) of the Texas Civil\nPractice and Remedies Code, which provides that “[a] person may appeal from an interlocutory order of a district court that\ngrants or denies a plea to the jurisdiction by a governmental unit as that term is defined in Section 101.001.” 2 Tex. Civ. Prac. &\nRem.Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp.1999). A plea to the jurisdiction contests the trial court's authority to adjudicate the\nsubject matter of the cause of action. See Dolenz v. Texas State Bd. of Med. Exam., 899 S.W.2d 809, 811 (Tex.App.—Austin\n1995, no writ); Schulz v. Schulz, 726 S.W.2d 256, 257 (Tex.App.—Austin 1987, no writ). In a proper plea to the jurisdiction, a\ndefendant contends that, even if all the allegations in a plaintiff's pleadings are taken as true, there is an incurable jurisdictional\ndefect apparent from the face of the pleadings. See *730 Firemen's Ins. Co. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Tex. Sys., 909\nS.W.2d 540, 541 (Tex.App.—Austin 1995, writ denied) (citing Bybee v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 160 Tex. 429, 331 S.W.2d\n910, 917 (1960)); Washington v. Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist., 892 S.W.2d 156, 159 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ\ndenied). In reviewing the grant or denial of a plea to the jurisdiction, we do not look at the merits of the case. See Firemen's Ins.\nCo., 909 S.W.2d at 541. This Court recently held that a governmental unit is free to appeal a trial court's denial of its plea to\nthe jurisdiction under section 51.014(a)(8), regardless of the basis on which it asserts a lack of jurisdiction. See City of Austin\nv. L.S. Ranch, Ltd., 970 S.W.2d 750, 752 (Tex.App.—Austin 1998, no pet.). Thus, a government unit's plea to the jurisdiction\nneed not be based upon a claim of sovereign immunity in order for it to bring an interlocutory appeal under section 51.014(a)\n(8). See id. Nevertheless, because the statute authorizing interlocutory appeals is a narrow exception to the general rule that\nonly final judgments and orders are appealable, we must give it a strict construction. See id. at 753; America Online, Inc. v.\nWilliams, 958 S.W.2d 268, 271 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, no pet.); Tober v. Turner of Texas, Inc., 668 S.W.2d\n831, 835 (Tex.App.—Austin 1984, no writ). Thus, we will limit our discussion to the narrow issue that is before us, the question\nof whether the trial court erred in denying TxDOT's plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

City of Sunset Valley, 8 S.W.3d 727 (1999)\n\n\n\n\nStanding\n [5] [6] [7] We first address TxDOT's argument that the district court erred in overruling its plea to the jurisdiction because\nSunset Valley lacks standing to sue TxDOT for the appropriation of Jones Road. In order for a court to have subject matter\njurisdiction, the party bringing suit must have standing. See Texas Ass'n of Bus. v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440,\n443–46 (Tex.1993). To establish standing, a party must show that (1) a real controversy exists between the parties and (2) the\ncontroversy will actually be determined by the judicial relief sought. See id. at 446.\n\n [8] TxDOT argues that because a city's interest in its streets is subordinate to the interests of the State, and since the legislature\nhas provided TxDOT statutory authority to appropriate city streets for the construction of controlled-access highways, Sunset\nValley cannot successfully bring an action against the State for TxDOT's appropriation of its streets. See City of Mission v.\nPopplewell, 156 Tex. 269, 294 S.W.2d 712, 715 (1956) (holding that legal title to city streets belongs to State and that cities'\nauthority and control limited to extent delegated by legislature or state constitution); Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 203.003 (West\nSupp.1999) (authorizing transportation commission to exercise powers to lay out, construct, maintain, and operate a state\nhighway in a county or municipality without consent of county or municipality). TxDOT contends that because Sunset Valley\ncannot successfully bring an action for the taking of its streets, it has no claim and ultimately lacks standing to bring suit. We\ndisagree with this analysis.\n\nAlthough TxDOT characterizes this as an issue of standing, in reality TxDOT is seeking a determination of this case on the\nmerits. TxDOT confuses the jurisdictional question of whether Sunset Valley has standing to bring a cause of action for the\nState's appropriation of city streets with the substantive issue of whether Sunset Valley should prevail on the merits of its\ncase. TxDOT is attempting to meld its appeal of the denial of its plea to the jurisdiction with an appeal of the partial summary\njudgment rendered against it by the trial court. 3 As we have stated previously, *731 this Court is not authorized to review\nthe merits of Sunset Valley's claims in this interlocutory appeal. We decline to permit TxDOT to use this interlocutory appeal\nas a vehicle to circumvent the bounds set by the statute in order to obtain judicial review of the merits of Sunset Valley's case\nbefore the district court has rendered a final judgment. 4\n\nCertainly, a city has standing to bring suit against the State for appropriation of that city's streets, regardless of whether its\naction is ultimately unsuccessful. TxDOT cites no case law in support of its contention that municipalities lack standing to sue\nthe State for the physical appropriation of city streets. Likewise, we are unable to find any authority supporting this argument.\nHere, Sunset Valley has pleaded that it has a justiciable interest in the street that was taken and that as a city, it has an interest\nin maintaining its streets for its residents. Cities have always had standing to litigate issues involving their entitlement to public\nproperty in suits against other state governmental entities. 5\n\n [9] In asserting a claim to the streets that run within its boundaries, Sunset Valley has shown that a controversy exists as\nto the nature and extent of its interest in its streets and the State's responsibility for compensation. The ultimate question of\nwhether Sunset Valley can prevail in its suit against TxDOT is a matter for the trial court to decide on the merits. “A plea to\nthe jurisdiction of the trial court is not sustainable where the contention is to the effect that the plaintiff has falsely stated a\nclaim which, in fact, is nonexistent, for this is a matter of defense on the merits.” Bernard Hanyard Enters., Inc. v. McBeath,\n663 S.W.2d 639, 642 (Tex.App.—Austin 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Because TxDOT has not presented this Court with a true\njurisdictional issue, we overrule appellant's first issue.\n\n\nCircuity of Travel, Noise and Light Pollution\n [10] Having determined that Sunset Valley has standing to sue for the physical taking of its streets, we now address TxDOT's\nargument that Sunset Valley has no standing to sue TxDOT for any injuries resulting from increased circuity of travel and the\nlight and noise pollution resulting from the expansion of Highway 290. In *732 support of this argument, TxDOT states in its\nbrief that whether there has been a material and substantial impairment of access or whether there exists an issue of increased\ncircuity of travel is a question of law that must be decided by the trial court. See State v. Wood Oil Distrib. Co., 751 S.W.2d 863,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                5\n\fTexas Dept. of Transp. v. City of Sunset Valley, 8 S.W.3d 727 (1999)\n\n\n865 (Tex.1988). TxDOT adds that the burden of proving a compensable impairment of access is upon the landowner and that\nif the reconfiguration has caused only an increased circuity of travel, any injury suffered by Sunset Valley is noncompensable.\nSee id.; State v. Westgate, 798 S.W.2d 903, 906–7 (Tex.App.—Austin 1990), aff'd, Westgate v. State, 843 S.W.2d 448 (1992).\n\n [11] Once again, TxDOT is attempting to reach beyond the narrow jurisdictional issue before us in order to argue its case\non the merits. If a judicial determination of the issue of increased circuity of travel is necessary and the burden of proof is\nupon the landowner to prove a compensable impairment of access, surely that same landowner has standing to bring the action\nnecessary to receive this judicial determination. TxDOT cannot successfully argue that because a defense of circuity of travel\nmay exist, Sunset Valley has no standing to bring suit in the first place. TxDOT's circuity-of-travel contentions concern questions\nof compensable injuries and the measure of damages, which are questions on the merits, not jurisdictional issues. Likewise,\nTxDOT's argument that Sunset Valley's claims for injuries resulting from the noise and light pollution caused by the highway\nexpansion are not compensable again goes to the merits of the case and not to the jurisdictional issue of standing. The fact that\nSunset Valley has alleged injury to the public it represents is enough to confer standing. We overrule TxDOT's second issue.\n\n\nSovereign Immunity\n [12] In its third and final issue, TxDOT argues that the district court erred in denying its plea to the jurisdiction because it\nis immune from suit pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, specifically with respect to Sunset Valley's request for\ndeclaratory judgment on its noise and light pollution claims. TxDOT complains that this declaratory relief compels the State\nthrough its officials to perform certain acts without the required legislative consent. See Griffin v. Hawn, 161 Tex. 422, 341\nS.W.2d 151, 153 (1960) (holding that where purpose of proceeding against state officials is to control action of State, suit is\nagainst State and cannot be maintained without legislature's consent).\n\nFirst, TxDOT mischaracterizes the trial court's judgment. In its partial, interlocutory summary judgment, the trial court granted\nTxDOT's jurisdictional challenge to Sunset Valley's request for relief by mandamus and denied Sunset Valley's request for an\ninjunction. The only relief that the court granted Sunset Valley was a declaratory judgment with respect to its claim for noise\npollution. Contrary to TxDOT's assertions, this relief does not require the State to take any action. The trial court expressly\nrejected any such relief when it denied Sunset Valley's requests for a mandamus and injunction.\n\n[13]    [14]   Furthermore, although the State as sovereign is generally immune from both liability and suit without its consent,\nactions for inverse condemnation brought pursuant to article I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution 6 comprise a limited\nexception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See Federal Sign v. Texas S. Univ., 951 S.W.2d 401, 405 (Tex.1997); State\nv. Biggar, 848 S.W.2d 291, 295 (Tex.App.—Austin 1993), aff'd, 873 S.W.2d 11 (1994). When a governmental entity takes,\ndamages, or destroys property for public use, the Constitution waives the *733 governmental entity's immunity from both suit\nand liability. See Steele v. City of Houston, 603 S.W.2d 786, 791 (Tex.1980); Dillard v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 806 S.W.2d\n589, 596 (Tex.App.—Austin 1991, writ denied). A claim for nuisance is an alternative ground of recovery under article 1,\nsection 17 and is also an exception to sovereign immunity. See Tarrant County v. English, 989 S.W.2d 368, 374 (Tex.App.—\nFort Worth 1998, pet. denied); Golden Harvest Co. v. City of Dallas, 942 S.W.2d 682, 688–90 (Tex.App.—Tyler 1997, writ\ndenied) (holding sovereign immunity does not make city immune from action for nuisance caused by city's non-negligent or\nintentional acts where suit brought under article I, section 17 of Constitution). Because Sunset Valley's entire claim is in the\nnature of a takings claim and the declaratory relief of which TxDOT complains involves a nuisance claim for noise and light\npollution, TxDOT cannot successfully assert sovereign immunity from suit. Accordingly, we overrule TxDOT's final issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled all three issues TxDOT raised in this interlocutory appeal, we affirm the trial court's denial of TxDOT's plea\nto the jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The issues here are whether the district court had continuing jurisdiction\nover a trust it created under Chapter 142 of the Texas Trust Code, and whether the district court's order went beyond the\nrelief TSB's motion requested. Because the district court did have continuing jurisdiction over the trust but the district court's\njudgment exceeded the relief TSB's motion requested, we reinstate only a part of the order and affirm the court of appeals'\njudgment, as modified.\n\n\n\n                                                                 I.\n\nRutilo Vargas Amaro (Vargas) 1 suffered severe injuries in a sugarcane field burn-off. He sued the field's owners, Rio Grande\nValley Sugar Growers, Inc. (Sugar Growers), for negligence in the 206th district court and received a substantial settlement.\nIn 1989, the district court adjudged Vargas incapacitated as defined by section 142.007 of the Texas Property Code, and, on\nVargas's guardian's motion, the court created a trust for him under section 142.005 of the Code. The trust document provided\nthat the trust would terminate when Vargas regained capacity, and the district court's decree stated that the trust would “take\neffect immediately to remain in full force and effect until further orders of this Court.” TSB served as trustee during the trust's\nnine-year existence.\n\nIn May 1997, Vargas filed a “Motion for Termination of Trust” in the 206th district court, alleging that he had regained capacity.\nIn September 1997, before the 206th district court had ruled on Vargas's motion, the 370th District Court of Hidalgo County\nissued an order in Vargas's uncontested divorce action decreeing that Vargas was fully capable of acting as sole managing\nconservator for his minor child and suffered no incapacity. Five days after the 370th district court issued its order, Vargas filed\na motion with the 206th district court to withdraw his request to terminate the trust and, the following day, he filed a notice\nof nonsuit in the 206th district court. Vargas then sent a letter to TSB, demanding that TSB release the trust funds due to the\ndivorce court's adjudication of his regained capacity. In the letter, Vargas threatened TSB with legal action if TSB did not\npromptly comply with the request.\n\nTSB responded by tendering the trust funds to the 206th district court and filing a “Motion Regarding the Rutilo Vargas Amaro\nTrust for Declaratory Judgment and for Other Relief” under the caption of the original personal-injury suit between Vargas\nand Sugar Growers. In this motion, filed September 18, 1997, TSB asked the court: (1) to determine if the trust was terminated\nbecause of Vargas's regained *541 capacity; (2) to allow TSB to resign as trustee and to appoint a substitute trustee in case\nthe trust was not terminated; (3) to “approve final accountings to be submitted to the Court;” and (4) to order any “other and\nfurther relief, at law or in equity, to which TSB may be justly entitled.” TSB alleged jurisdiction under Chapter 142 of the Texas\nProperty Code, the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, 2 and section 115.001 of the Texas Trust Code. 3\n\nOn October 6, Vargas filed a plea to the jurisdiction arguing that the 206th district court did not have continuing jurisdiction\nover the trust, and that the 370th district court had jurisdiction to determine Vargas's capacity. At the same time, he filed a\n“Notice of Determination of Capacity” with the 206th district court, informing the court that the 370th district court had found\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Vargas argued that the trust had terminated by its own terms when the 370th district court ruled that Vargas was not\nincapacitated.\n\nVargas then filed a new suit against TSB in the 93rd District Court, also in Hidalgo County. This suit alleged that TSB had\ncommitted fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, breach of contract, and\nDTPA violations in administering the trust. Some of TSB's alleged misconduct, according to Vargas, had to do with improper\nand imprudent investment decisions, failing to keep Vargas fully informed of trust decisions, and failing to keep proper records\nregarding the trust. This suit is still pending and discovery is proceeding.\n\nOn November 25, 1997, the 206th district court denied Vargas's plea to the jurisdiction and claimed jurisdiction “to any matter\npertaining to the assets of Mr. Rutilo Vargas as it relates to matters of his Trust.” On February 26, 1998, Vargas filed a\n“Supplemental Notice of Determination of Capacity and Request for Release of Monies Owed to Rutilo Vargas Amaro” and\nscheduled a hearing for March 11, 1998. Through a letter to the court coordinator, sent six days before the hearing date, TSB gave\nnotice that it was also scheduling a hearing on its “Motion Regarding the Rutilo Vargas Amaro Trust for Declaratory Judgment\nand for Other Relief.” Vargas objected to TSB's request to have the 206th district court “make final legal determinations,”\narguing that the notice requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 245 were not met.\n\nThe 206th district court held hearings on both parties' motions and, on March 17, issued an “Order Terminating Trust, Approving\nTrust Administration, Investment Philosophy, Accounting, Actions and Fees, and Discharging Trustee Relating to the Rutilo\nVargas Amaro Trust.” In this order, the court terminated the trust due to Vargas's regained capacity and approved all accountings\nTSB presented, including all distributions TSB made, all fees TSB received, and all fees, costs, and expenses TSB paid. In\naddition, the court approved TSB's investment philosophy and ordered that “[s]ubject to the payment to Vargas ... as directed\nabove, the Court discharges TSB as trustee and releases TSB as trustee from any liability to the Trust or to Vargas.”\n\nVargas appealed, complaining that the 206th district court erred in absolving TSB *542 of liability for its handling of the\ntrust. Vargas argued that the Declaratory Judgments Act could not expand the district court's jurisdiction over the trust to allow\nit to adjudicate Vargas's tort claims against TSB. The court of appeals agreed, and modified the district court's judgment by\nreversing those parts of the district court's order: (1) approving all distributions, fees, costs, and expenses TSB paid, except for\nthe fees, costs, and expenses relating to the trust's termination; (2) approving TSB's investment philosophy; and (3) absolving\nTSB from any liability to Vargas or the Vargas trust. 28 S.W.3d at 796.\n\nTSB filed a petition for review, asking this Court to resolve four issues: 1) Did the 206th district court exercise continuing\njurisdiction over the Chapter 142 trust that it created, and thus have jurisdiction to issue its declaratory judgment in connection\nwith the trust, related issues, and parties? 2) Did the 206th district court have jurisdiction to and properly approve the investment\nphilosophy, distributions, and expenses of the trustee of the Vargas trust, to discharge the trustee from liability, and to issue its\ndeclaratory relief? 3) Did Vargas waive his argument concerning the proper scope of declaratory relief by failing to make the\nargument to the district court? and, 4) Did Vargas waive his arguments by accepting payment under the judgment?\n\nVargas counters by asking this Court to consider cross-points that would preclude reinstatement of those parts of the 206th\ndistrict court's judgment reversed by the court of appeals. Specifically, Vargas urges that the district court erred in rendering\njudgment for TSB when Vargas was not given the required forty-five days notice of trial under Rule 245 of the Texas Rules\nof Civil Procedure, and, alternatively, the district court erred in rendering judgment for TSB even though Vargas was denied\nhis right to a jury trial.\n\n\n\n                                                                 II.\n\n [1] We first consider the district court's jurisdiction over a trust created under Texas Property Code section 142.005.

J. 1302\n\njurisdiction over the trust created in that suit. TSB's motion specifically requested the 206th district court to determine whether\nthe trust was terminated due to Vargas's regained capacity, to allow TSB to resign if the trust was not terminated, and to approve\nTSB's final accounting of the trust.\n\nChapter 142 provides that the trust will continue until terminated or revoked, and allows the court to amend, modify, or revoke\nthe trust at any time before its termination. TEX. PROP.CODE § 142.005(d),(f). The 206th district court's decree creating the\ntrust stated that the trust would “take effect immediately to remain in full force and effect until further orders of this court.” And\nthe trust document itself provides that the “Court shall retain the right at any time before the termination of this trust to amend,\nalter, modify, or revoke this trust.” Taken together, these documents invoke the 206th district court's continuing jurisdiction\nover the trust under Chapter 142. Therefore, the 206th district court had continuing jurisdiction over the Vargas trust until such\ntime that it terminated the trust. Thus, although the 370th district court adjudicated Vargas's capacity in the divorce action,\nthe 206th had jurisdiction to consider whether he regained capacity such that the trust was terminated, and the trust did not\nterminate until the 206th so decreed.\n\n\n\n                                                              *543 III.\n\n [2] Having determined that the 206th district court had continuing jurisdiction to determine issues related to the trust and its\ntermination, we now consider whether the court properly exercised that jurisdiction by ordering the relief that it did. As noted,\nthe district court has continuing jurisdiction to supervise, modify, revoke, and terminate the trust. Further, section 142.005(b)\n(4) provides that the trust terminates when the beneficiary regains capacity and section 142.005(e) provides that upon the\ntrust's termination the principal and undistributed income shall be paid to the beneficiary. In this case, neither capacity nor\nthe district court's order terminating the trust are disputed. The question here is whether the remainder of the district court's\norder—specifically, approval of TSB's accounting, approval of TSB's investment philosophy, and absolving TSB of liability\n—was properly granted.\n\nTo determine the corpus due to the beneficiary, the trustee may provide the terminating court with a final accounting of the\ntrust funds for examination. In its motion to the 206th district court, TSB asked the court to “approve final accountings to be\nsubmitted to the Court.” Property Code section 113.152 provides what an accounting should contain.\n\nA written statement of accounts shall show:\n\n  (1) all trust property that has come to the trustee's knowledge or into the trustee's possession and that has not been previously\n  listed or inventoried as property of the trust;\n\n  (2) a complete account of receipts, disbursements, and other transactions regarding the trust property for the period covered\n  by the account, including their source and nature, with receipts of principal and income shown separately;\n\n  (3) a listing of all property being administered, with an adequate description of each asset;\n\n  (4) the cash balance on hand and the name and location of the depository where the balance is kept; and\n\n  (5) all known liabilities owed by the trust.\n\nTEX. PROP.CODE § 113.152. In the context of a terminating trust, the statutory requirements for an accounting form the\nbasis winding up the trust to ascertain the balance due to the beneficiary. Nowhere does section 113.152 mention investment\nphilosophy or potential tort liability to the beneficiary with regard to an accounting. Thus, these determinations are not\ncomponents of an accounting. Accordingly, although the 206th district court's approving TSB's accounting was appropriate\nunder TSB's motion to the court, the 206th district court's approving TSB's investment philosophy and absolving TSB's tort\nliability, if any, were not. The 206th district court improperly granted relief that TSB did not request. TSB's motion asked the\ndistrict court only to determine whether the trust was terminated, to remove TSB as trustee if the trust was not terminated, and\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1302\n\nto approve TSB's final accounting. In its motion, TSB did not ask the district court to adjudicate TSB's potential tort liability\nas trustee, nor to approve TSB's investment philosophy, and therefore the district court should not have ruled on these issues.\nWe conclude that the court of appeals was correct in reversing those parts of the district court's order.\n\n\n\n                                                                IV.\n\n [3] The court of appeals further modified the district court's order by reversing that part of the order approving all distributions,\nfees, costs, and expenses TSB paid from the Vargas trust except those relating to the trust's termination. But Chapter 142 of\nthe Property Code gives *544 the court of continuing jurisdiction the power to approve the trustee's fees, TEX. PROP.CODE\n§ 142.005(b)(6), and the trust instrument also provided that “[t]he trustee shall receive reasonable compensation ... on\napplication to and approval of the 206th District Court.” And because the distributions, costs, and expenses of a trust would be\n“disbursements” under Property Code section 113.152(2), and therefore properly part of the trustee's accounting, we hold that\nthe court of appeals erred by reversing that part of the district court's order. Accordingly, we reinstate that part.\n\n\n\n                                                                 V.\n\n [4] TSB argues that Vargas waived his objections to the proper scope of the declaratory relief the district court granted by\nfailing to make the argument to the district court. We disagree. The error is that the district court's order exceeded the relief\nTSB's motion requested. Vargas objected at the March hearing to the introduction and consideration of evidence that went\nbeyond TSB's request for relief. And, Vargas's brief to the court of appeals clearly objected to the fact that the district court\nwent far beyond the scope of TSB's motion in its final order. Vargas properly preserved his objections.\n\n\n\n                                                                VI.\n\n [5] [6] Finally, TSB argues that Vargas waived his objection to the district court's judgment by accepting payment of his\ntrust monies under that judgment. This Court, in Carle v. Carle, stated that a “litigant cannot treat a judgment as both right and\nwrong, and if he has voluntarily accepted the benefits of a judgment, he cannot afterward prosecute an appeal therefrom.” 149\nTex. 469, 234 S.W.2d 1002, 1004 (1950). There is a narrow exception to this rule that as long as an appellant “accepts only that\nwhich appellee concedes, or is bound to concede, to be due him under the judgment he is not estopped to prosecute an appeal\nwhich involves only his right to a further recovery.” Id.\n\nHere, neither side disputes that capacity was regained and that the trust should have been terminated. And neither party argues\nwith winding up the trust and distributing the corpus. Vargas contested only the district court's ability to rule on TSB's potential\ntort liability to Vargas as trustee. Therefore, Vargas's acceptance of the trust corpus is not inconsistent with his position and\nfalls within the Carle exception.\n\n\n\n                                                                VII.\n\nBecause we reinstate the trial court's judgment approving the accounting, including the approval of distributions, fees, costs, and\nexpenses, we next consider Vargas's alternative grounds for affirming the court of appeals' judgment reversing these rulings.\nVargas argues that judgment cannot be rendered on these issues because he was not given the forty-five days notice of trial\nrequired under Rule 245 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Vargas also argues that the 206th district court erred in rendering\njudgment for TSB because it denied him the right to a jury trial.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1302\n\n [7] As we stated above, the trustee may provide the court with a final accounting of the trust funds to determine the amount\ndue to the beneficiary, and we held that the court's approval of the accounting was within its jurisdiction and within the scope of\nrelief requested by TSB's motion. To properly assess Vargas's argument that the ruling violates his due process rights, we must\ndetermine the nature of the trial court's ruling. TSB contends that “[a]pproval of an ‘accounting’ involves more than merely\napproval of *545 the math involved in expenditure and disbursement: approval of an accounting disposes of all claims that\nmight be made in regard to matters relating thereto.” For support, TSB cites only one case—Coble Wall Trust Co., Inc. v. Palmer,\n859 S.W.2d 475, 480–81 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1993, writ denied). In that case, the court of appeals held that a probate court's\njudgment, after a full hearing based on the new administrators' and others' objections, that approved the final accounts and\ndischarged Coble Wall from all liability barred the plaintiff's subsequent suit for negligence and DTPA violations. In that case,\nfull evidentiary hearings were conducted and the court of appeals noted that all of the contentions advanced by the plaintiffs\nregarding the estate plan and fees were heard by the probate court and thus were placed in issue and adjudicated. Thus, the\nguardian's liability had been fully litigated in the probate court. Coble Wall does not hold that a court's approval of an accounting\nnecessarily includes adjudication of the trustee's tort liability; it merely affirms that, in certain circumstances, it may. 4\n\n [8] Contrary to TSB's assertion, the Trust Code does not contemplate that an accounting will settle the trustee's tort liability.\nAs noted, section 113.152 establishes the contents of an accounting and requires the trustee to list trust property, transactions,\nproperty, cash, and all known liabilities owed by the trust. It simply does not reach the trustee's tort liability. This conclusion\nis supported by the Trust Code's structure, which includes Subchapter E “Accounting by Trustee” within Chapter 113, entitled\n“Administration.” In contrast, Chapter 114 concerns “liabilities, rights, and remedies of trustees, beneficiaries, and third\npersons.” Thus, the final accounting “form[s] the basis for a winding up of the trust to ascertain the balance due to the\nbeneficiary.” Supra at 543. As TSB states in its brief, “TSB's requested relief in essence provided for determination of what\namounts should be paid to Vargas by TSB and the closing of the trust and issues relating thereto.” Determining TSB's tort\nliability is not necessary to the closing of the trust or ascertaining the trust balance due the beneficiary, and, as we held above,\nwas not within the scope of TSB's requested relief. Accordingly, because approving the accounting, including the distributions,\ncosts, and expenses, was not an adjudication of TSB's tort liabilities, Vargas was not entitled to a jury or to forty-five days\nnotice of the hearing.\n\n\n\n                                                                 VIII.\n\nIn sum, we conclude that under Property Code section 142.005 and the trust documents, the district court had continuing\njurisdiction to rule on the issues requested by TSB's motion; specifically, the 206th district court had jurisdiction in this case to\nterminate the trust and to approve TSB's final accounting, including all distributions, fees, costs, and expenses of the trust. We\nhold that the 206th district court's order exceeded, in part, the relief TSB requested and should not have encompassed approving\nTSB's investment philosophy, nor ruling on TSB's potential tort liability to Vargas. We modify the court of appeal's judgment\nby reinstating that part of the 206th district court's order approving the distributions, fees, costs, *546 and expenses TSB paid\nfrom the Vargas Trust. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeal's judgment, as modified.\n\n\n\nJustice SCHNEIDER did not participate in the decision.\n\nParallel Citations\n\n45 Tex. Sup. Ct.

In September of\n1982 Turner instituted this action against Tober. Turner contended that Tober had violated an agreement not to compete with\nTurner; Turner sought damages for prior breaches of the agreement as well as an injunction precluding future breaches. Tober\nlodged a counterclaim against Turner, seeking damages for Turner's alleged wrongful withholding of commissions earned by\nTober.\n\nOn October 11, 1982, following an evidentiary hearing at which both Tober and Turner participated, the trial court signed an\norder which temporarily enjoined Tober from, inter alia, selling specialty advertising items within all of Travis County and the\ncity limits of San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston. On November 9, 1982 Turner filed a motion requesting that the\ntrial court order Tober to appear and show cause as to why Tober should not be held in contempt. On November 16, 1982 Tober\nfiled a motion captioned “Defendant's Response To Plaintiff's Motion To Show Cause; Defendant's Amended Motion To Set\nAside the Temporary Restraining Order And/Or Alternatively Motion to Provide Adequate Bond.”\n\nOn December 1, 1982 the trial court, following a hearing at which Tober and Turner were represented, signed an order overruling\nTober's motion (apparently treating it as a motion to dissolve the temporary injunction). The trial court also found Tober in\ncontempt of the temporary injunction; the contempt order is not here challenged. Tober made a cash deposit in lieu of an appeal\nbond on December 13, 1982.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] We initially note that although Tober purports to appeal from the order granting temporary injunction\nas well as the order overruling his subsequently filed motion, he has not perfected an appeal from the initial order. While an\norder granting a temporary injunction is an appealable interlocutory order, see Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 4662 (Supp.1982),\nthe appeal of such an order must conform to the requirements for accelerated appeals, Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 385 (Supp.1983). In\nall accelerated *834 appeals, the deposit in lieu of appeal bond must be made within thirty days after the order is signed. Id.\n385(d). Such a requirement is a prerequisite to invoking this Court's jurisdiction; since Tober made an untimely cash deposit,\nwe are without jurisdiction to consider an appeal of the order granting a temporary injunction. Marshall v. Good Times, Inc.,\n537 S.W.2d 536 (Tex.Civ.App.1976, writ dism'd).\n\n [5] [6] However, Tober's cash deposit was made within thirty days of the signing of the order overruling Tober's subsequent\nmotion. Although that subsequent motion was rather awkwardly titled, to the extent possible we will treat it as a motion to\ndissolve the temporary injunction. An order overruling a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction is an appealable interlocutory\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 4662 (Supp.1982). Therefore, although we lack jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the order\ngranting the temporary injunction, we have jurisdiction to review the trial court's order overruling the motion to dissolve the\ninjunction. Marshall v. Good Times, Inc., supra.\n\n [7] [8] [9] The determination of the question of whether to dissolve a temporary injunction is a matter lying within the\ndiscretion of the trial court; the scope of this Court's review of a trial court order overruling a motion to dissolve a temporary\ninjunction is limited to the narrow question of whether the action of the trial judge, in overruling the motion to dissolve,\nconstituted an abuse of discretion. Marshall v. Good Times, Inc., supra. Tober, as movant, has the burden to show that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion. Id.\n\nAs stated above, Tober was represented at the hearing on the application for temporary injunction. At that hearing Tober\npresented evidence in opposition to the granting of the temporary injunction. Later, at the hearing on the motion to dissolve the\ntemporary injunction, Tober presented no evidence in support of dissolution; his case was based exclusively upon his attorney's\nlegal argument.\n\nAppellant's first four points of error relate to errors allegedly committed by the trial court in originally granting the temporary\ninjunction; each of these matters were brought to the trial court's attention prior to the signing of the temporary injunction order,\nand were obviously rejected by the trial court. These points of error provide that the trial court erred in granting the temporary\ninjunction because: (1) neither the contract of employment nor the restrictive covenant designate the market area of Turner,\n(2) the restrictive covenant is not reasonable either as to limitation of time or limitation of geographical area, (3) under the\nevidence presented Turner had breached the contract of employment prior to any breach upon the part of Tober, and (4) an\ninadequate injunction bond was set by the court.\n\n [10] We hold that the above four points of error are not a proper basis upon which Tober may contend that the trial court\nabused its discretion in overruling the motion to dissolve. They are a proper basis upon which Tober could have contended,\nupon direct appeal of the order granting the temporary injunction, that the trial court abused its discretion in granting such. By\nfailing to perfect an appeal from the grant of the temporary injunction, Tober has now, upon appeal of the motion to dissolve,\nwaived the right to complain of the specified alleged errors; this is particularly true where, as here, none of the alleged errors\nare fundamental (i.e. jurisdictional) in nature, and where, as here, the trial court was made aware of such alleged errors prior\nto signing the temporary injunction.\n\n [11] Additionally, to the extent that appellant complains that the restrictive covenant was unreasonable as to geographic scope,\nwe note that the trial court has limited the scope of the temporary injunction in this regard, and has thereby reformed the\ncovenant. Since this is not an appeal of the grant of the temporary injunction, we will presume that the record as a whole supports\nthe trial court's action in granting the temporary injunction. See State v. Friedmann, 572 S.W.2d 373 (Tex.Civ.App.1978, writ\nref'd n.r.e.) We will not *835 look to the statement of facts from the hearing on the motion to grant the temporary injunction\nto ascertain if the evidence supports such grant. Id.\n\n [12] [13] Finally, we hold that the trial court has no duty, upon the filing of a motion to dissolve, to reconsider the propriety\nof the granting of a temporary injunction, at least where the motion does not allege fundamental error, and also where the\nmotion is not based upon evidence of changed conditions but is rather based upon evidence which was before the court at the\nprior hearing on the motion to grant the temporary injunction. We will specify both practical and legal reasons for this holding\nbelow; however, assuming it to be sound, the trial court cannot be held to have abused its discretion where, as here, it refused\nto alter its prior decision in the absence of new evidence.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, if a litigant could, by motion to dissolve, force reconsideration of the original grant, without a\nshowing of changed conditions, then there is an incentive for him to do so at least once, or more often, in hope that he will be\nable to wear down the resistance of the original trial judge, or in hope that he will be able to secure a hearing before a different\ntrial judge who may be more sympathetic. Such actions needlessly add to the judicial caseload, both at the trial and appellate\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Recognition of the principle that the trial court has no duty to reconsider the validity of the original grant of temporary\ninjunction upon motion to dissolve enables the trial court to dispose of motions to dissolve solely upon the pleadings when the\nmotion to dissolve, on its face, shows that the litigant offers no new evidence.\n\n [14] There is a legal basis for holding that the trial court has no duty, upon motion to dissolve, to reconsider the original grant\nof temporary injunction. Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 385 (Supp.1983) provides that no motion for new trial shall be filed in appeals from\ninterlocutory orders appealable by law. The purpose of this rule is to avoid duplicity of effort and to give some degree of finality\nto interlocutory orders. If a litigant is permitted, upon motion to dissolve, to again challenge the original temporary injunction\ngrant, without an allegation of changed conditions, then the litigant could accomplish indirectly what he could not directly do\n(make a motion for new trial). Cf. State v. Friedmann, supra. In such a manner, the litigant could thereby render meaningless the\nappellate timetable applicable to accelerated appeals, see Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 385(d) (Supp.1983); a litigant, after unsuccessfully\nopposing a temporary injunction, could wait for an indefinite period to perfect an appeal of the grant of the temporary injunction\n(by filing a subsequent motion to dissolve, which raises the points of error which could have, and should have, been raised in\na direct appeal of the order granting temporary injunction).\n\n [15] [16] A motion to dissolve may not be used as a means of evading or expanding the rules applicable to appealing\ninterlocutory orders. A statute authorizing an appeal from an interlocutory order must be given a strict construction since the\nstatute is in derogation of the general rule that only final judgments and orders are appealable. 4 Tex.Jur.3d Appellate Review\n§ 70 (1980). We note that Tober did not file his motion to dissolve until after it was too late to perfect an appeal from the order\ngranting a temporary injunction.\n\n [17] [18] We should not be understood to say that a trial court lacks the authority to reverse its prior temporary injunction order\nabsent a showing of changed conditions; it does have that power. City of Hudson v. Ivie, 592 S.W.2d 658 (Tex.Civ.App.1979,\nno writ). We hold only that the trial court will not be deemed to have abused its discretion by refusing to reverse a prior grant\nof temporary injunction, absent pleading and proof of changed conditions, State v. Friedmann, supra; see 6 L. Lowe Texas\nPractice—Remedies § 186 (1973), or perhaps upon pleading and proof of fundamental (i.e. jurisdictional) error, but see Texas\nBoard of Examiners in Optometry v. Carp, 162 Tex. 1, 343 S.W.2d 242 (1961).\n\n *836 In Carp, the Supreme Court held that a plea of privilege, as to which appeal had not been timely perfected, was not\nreviewable in conjunction with review of an order granting temporary injunction, as to which appeal had been timely perfected.\nThe Supreme Court also held that the Court of Civil Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review pleas to the jurisdiction which had been\nrejected by the trial court. The Supreme Court stated the rule that appellate courts lack jurisdiction to review an unappealable\ninterlocutory order in an appeal “from another interlocutory order which is appealable except insofar as the questions raised\nmight affect the validity of the latter order.” 343 S.W.2d at 243. We hold that the questions relevant to the grant of the temporary\ninjunction, raised by Tober in this appeal, do not affect the validity of the order overruling the motion to dissolve; however,\nour holding does not here turn solely upon jurisdiction, but is also grounded upon Tober's failure to prove that the trial court\nabused its discretion in overruling the motion to dissolve.\n\nWe should stress that most of what we have said above, especially as it relates to the trial court's duty in considering a motion\nto dissolve, is applicable to temporary injunctions, which are granted only after notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary\nhearing; the trial court's duty in considering a motion to dissolve an injunctive order rendered without notice and opportunity for\nhearing would be broader. Compare State v. Friedmann, supra (motion to dissolve filed after full evidentiary hearing on grant\nof temporary injunction) with Whitaker v. Wilson, 349 S.W.2d 753 (Tex.Civ.App.1961, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (temporary injunction\ngranted solely upon intervenor's sworn petition).\n\nMuch of the confusion as to the proper scope of a motion to dissolve arises from cases decided at a time when no distinction\nwas made as between injunctive relief granted before and injunctive relief granted after a full evidentiary hearing. Apparently,\nunder prior law it was standard procedure for a trial court to issue a temporary injunction solely upon the applicant's sworn\npetition; therefore, upon filing a motion to dismiss, the opposite party had a right to a full evidentiary hearing upon the issue\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Turner of Texas, Inc., 668 S.W.2d 831 (1984)\n\n\nof whether the temporary injunction should have, in the first instance, been granted. See Plateau Oil Co. v. Choate Oil Corp.,\n235 S.W. 686 (Tex.Civ.App.1921, writ dism'd).\n\n [19] [20] [21] Under current rules the trial court may not enter a temporary injunction against a party before that party has\npresented its defenses and has rested its case. Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 681 (1967); Great Lakes Engineering, Inc. v. Andersen, 627\nS.W.2d 436 (Tex.App.1981, no writ); City of Austin v. Texas Public Emp. Ass'n, 528 S.W.2d 637 (Tex.Civ.App.1975, no writ).\nUnder this procedure the party opposing the temporary injunction has an opportunity to fully litigate the issue of whether the\ntemporary injunction should be granted prior to the granting of such; there is no longer any reason for requiring the trial court\nto reexamine the legal and factual basis of the preliminary injunction upon motion to dissolve. See Nu-Tred Tire Co. v. Dunlop\nTire & Rubber Corp., 118 Ariz. 417, 577 P.2d 268 (App.1978). The purpose of the motion to dissolve is to provide a means to\nshow that changed circumstances or changes in the law require the modification or dissolution of the injunction; the purpose\nis not to give an unsuccessful party an opportunity to relitigate the propriety of the original grant. Id.; see State v. Friedmann,\nsupra. Tober's first four points of error are overruled.\n\nIn his fifth point of error Tober contends that the trial court erred in granting a temporary injunction which by its terms restrained\npersons who were not parties to this action. Although this point attacks the original grant of temporary injunction, apparently\nit could not have been brought to the trial court's attention prior to entry of the judgment. However, it could have been raised\nin a direct appeal from the order granting temporary injunction. For that reason, it is questionable, under the above analysis,\nas to whether it can now be raised in the appeal of the order overruling the motion to dissolve. However, we need *837 not\nresolve that question, since it is obvious from reading the temporary injunction order that Tober, and no other person, is thereby\nenjoined. The fifth point of error is overruled.\n\nFinally, Tober complains that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to hear evidence of Turner's breach of the\nemployment contract. Tober contends that such evidence was relevant to showing that Turner lacked clean hands and that\nTurner was therefore not entitled to equitable relief.\n\n [22] To the extent that Tober complains of the trial court's refusal to hear evidence at the hearing on application for temporary\ninjunction, we hold, for reasons given above, that such is not within the proper scope of a motion to dissolve. The same holds\ntrue as to any complaint of the trial court's refusal, at the hearing on the motion to dissolve, to consider evidence not relevant\nto changed conditions, unless, perhaps, there is an allegation that such evidence is newly discovered.\n\n [23] Also, we have examined the statement of facts from the hearing on the motion to dissolve. At no point did Tober offer\nany evidence; the trial court certainly never prevented the introduction of any evidence. Even if the trial court had refused to\nhear testimony, Tober does not direct us to a bill of exceptions which would show what the witnesses would have testified\nto; therefore, no error is shown. Schutz v. Southern Union Gas Co., 617 S.W.2d 299 (Tex.App.1981, no writ). The final point\nof error is overruled.\n\nHaving overruled all of appellant's points of error, we affirm the trial court's order.\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                       © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The\nplaintiff's original petition alleged that the defendant, Uvalde Country Club, could be served by serving its registered agent,\nHenry Bunting, Jr., 137 West Nopal Street, in Uvalde, Uvalde County, Texas. The citation was directed to Uvalde Country\nClub, by serving its registered agent, “Henry Bunting.” The sheriff's return on this citation showed delivery to “Henry Bunting.”\nUvalde Country Club failed to answer, and the trial court rendered a default judgment in favor of Martin Linen Supply Company,\nInc. Uvalde Country Club brought writ of error to the court of appeals within six months of the default judgment. In affirming\nthe trial court judgment, the court of appeals held that the lack of “Jr.” was immaterial because it did not constitute any part\nof the name of the registered agent. 685 S.W.2d 375. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause\nto the trial court.\n\n [1] [2] The court of appeals holding conflicts with our holdings in Hendon v. Pugh, 46 Tex. 211, 212 (1876) and Faver v.\nRobinson, 46 Tex. 204 (1876). In Hendon, we remanded a default judgment because the return reflected that it was served on\nJ.N. Hendon, not the named defendant, J.W. *885 Hendon. In Faver, we remanded a default judgment against John R. Faver\nbecause the citation was addressed and served on John R. Favers. There are no presumptions in favor of valid issuance, service,\nand return of citation in the face of a writ of error attack on a default judgment. McKanna v. Edgar, 388 S.W.2d 927, 929\n(Tex.1965). Moreover, failure to affirmatively show strict compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure renders the attempted\nservice of process invalid and of no effect. McKanna, 388 S.W.2d at 929.\n\n [3] The record does not show that the person served with citation, “Henry Bunting,” was authorized to receive service or that\nhe was connected with the appellant. Rather, the petition alleges that the registered agent is “Henry Bunting, Jr.” Thus, the\nrecord in this case does not reflect strict compliance with the rules of civil procedure relating to the issuance, service, and return\nof citation. See, e.g., Tex.R.Civ.P. 101, 106, and 107.

Current lienholder\ncounterclaimed, seeking declaration that it was equitably subrogated to rights of prior lienholders. The 268th District Court,\nFort Bend County, Brady G. Elliott, J., granted summary judgment in favor of current lienholder and loan servicer and denied\nborrowers' motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\nHoldings: Court of Appeals, Marc W.

BROWN, Justice.\n\nThis case arises out of a home-equity loan obtained by appellants Alice M. Wood and Daniel L. Wood in 2004 that encumbered\ntheir homestead with a lien. The Woods appeal the summary judgment granted in favor of appellees HSBC Bank USA, N.A.\nand Ocwen Loan Servicing, L.L.C. The Woods presented a single issue on appeal, which we address in two separate sub-issues:\n\n  (1) Whether the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.051 four-year statute of limitations bars the Woods'\n     claims for monetary and declaratory relief based on HSBC's and Ocwen's alleged violations of the home-equity lending\n     protections found in article XVI, section 50(a)(6), of the Texas Constitution.\n\n  (2) Whether the section 16.051 statute of limitations bars the Woods' claim for monetary relief based on HSBC's and Ocwen's\n     alleged breach of the security instrument creating the home-equity lien.\n\nBecause we conclude that the Woods' claims are barred by limitations, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nOn July 2, 2004, the Woods obtained a home-equity loan of $76,000 from Fremont Investment & Loan, secured by a first\nlien on their homestead located in Fresno, Fort Bend County, Texas. On March 16, 2012, the Woods sent HSBC, the current\nholder of the lien, a “Notice of Request to Cure.” The Notice alleged that the home-equity lien violated seven provisions of\narticle XVI, section 50(a)(6), of the Texas Constitution and demanded that HSBC cure the alleged violations. HSBC did not\nrespond to the Woods' letter.\n\nOn July 9, 2012, the Woods sued HSBC, Ocwen, Ameriapraise, Inc., and Joel Brock seeking forfeiture of principal and interest\nfor the constitutional violations, damages for breach of contract, damages for fraud, and a declaratory judgment that (1) the\nloan and accompanying home-equity lien were void, (2) HSBC failed to cure the constitutional defects, and (3) HSBC must\nforfeit all principal and interest paid on the loan. HSBC and Ocwen answered on August 10, 2012. HSBC filed a counterclaim\non February 28, 2013, seeking a declaration that it was equitably subrogated to the rights of the prior lienholders.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 439 S.W.3d 585 (2014)\n\n\n\n\nOn January 3, 2013, the Woods filed a motion for summary judgment on their claim that the fees exceeded three percent of the\nloan amount. On February 7, 2013, HSBC and Ocwen filed a hybrid traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment.\nIn their motion, HSBC and Ocwen asserted that all of the Woods' claims were barred by limitations, that no tolling rule delayed\nthe accrual of the Woods' claims, that the constitutional claims failed as a matter of law, that the Woods' breach of contract\nclaim failed as a matter of law, and that no evidence supported the Woods' fraud claim. 1 On April 4, 2013, the trial court\ngranted HSBC's traditional and no- *589 evidence motions and denied the Woods' motion for summary judgment. The Woods\nthen nonsuited defendants Ameriapraise, Inc. and Joel Brock, and HSBC nonsuited its counterclaim for equitable subrogation\nagainst the Woods. The Woods timely appealed.\n\n\n\n                                 II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n [1] [2] We review the trial court's granting of summary judgment de novo. Mid–Century Ins. Co. of Tex. v. Ademaj, 243\nS.W.3d 618, 621 (Tex.2007). To prevail on a traditional motion for summary judgment, the movant must carry the burden of\nshowing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that judgment should be granted as a matter of law. Tex.R. Civ.\nP. 166a(c); KPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison Cty. Hous. Fin. Corp., 988 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex.1999). When reviewing a\ntraditional summary judgment granted in favor of the defendant, we determine whether the defendant conclusively disproved\nat least one element of the plaintiff's claim or conclusively proved every element of an affirmative defense. Am. Tobacco Co.\nv. Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex.1997).\n\n            A defendant moving for summary judgment on the affirmative defense of limitations ... must (1)\n            conclusively prove when the cause of action accrued, and (2) negate the discovery rule, if it applies and\n            has been pleaded or otherwise raised, by proving as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of\n            material fact about when the plaintiff discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have\n            discovered the nature of its injury. If the movant establishes that the statute of limitations bars the action,\n            the nonmovant must then adduce summary judgment proof raising a fact issue in avoidance of the statute\n            of limitations.\n\nKPMG Peat Marwick, 988 S.W.2d at 748 (footnotes omitted). A matter is conclusively established if reasonable people could\nnot differ as to the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence. Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Rodriguez, 366 S.W.3d 216, 221 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet. denied). In deciding whether a disputed material fact issue exists precluding summary judgment,\nwe must take evidence favorable to the non-movant as true, and we must indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any\ndoubts in favor of the non-movant. Sysco Food Servs., Inc. v. Trapnell, 890 S.W.2d 796, 800 (Tex.1994). We will affirm\nthe summary judgment if any of the theories presented to the trial court and preserved for appellate review are meritorious.\nProvident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 216 (Tex.2003).\n\n\n\n                                                       III. DISCUSSION\n\nA. The Woods' claims for monetary and declaratory relief under Texas Constitution article XVI, section 50(a)(6), are\nbarred by the section 16.051 four-year statute of limitations.\nThe Woods alleged in their petition that the home-equity lien on their residence violated article XVI, sections 50(a)(6)(B), 50(a)\n(6)(E), 50(a)(6)(Q)(v), and 50(a)(6)(Q)(viii), of the Texas Constitution. The Woods contend that their home-equity lien is void\nbecause of section 50(c), which states, “No mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the homestead shall ever be valid unless it\nsecures a debt described by this section ....” Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 50(c). The Woods assert that section 50(c) renders “void\nbut curable” any home-equity lien that does not strictly comply with a provision of section 50(a)(6). Consequently, because an\naction to remove a cloud on *590 title is not subject to the four-year residual statute of limitations if a lien is void, see Ford\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., 235 S.W.3d 615, 618 (Tex.2007), the Woods argue that the trial court erred in granting summary\njudgment in favor of HSBC.\n\nHSBC and Ocwen respond that the Woods' constitutional claims are barred by the four-year residual statute of limitations.\nRelying on the Dallas Court of Appeals' decision in Williams v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., 407 S.W.3d 391 (Tex.App.-Dallas\n2013, pet. denied), and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in Priester v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 708 F.3d 667\n(5th Cir.2013), cert. denied, ––– U.S. ––––, 134 S.Ct. 196, 187 L.Ed.2d 256 (2013), they contend a lien that violates section\n50(a)(6) is voidable. They further assert that section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x) allows a lender to cure a lien that would otherwise be invalid.\nHSBC argues that the trial court properly granted summary judgment on limitations grounds because a voidable lien is subject\nto limitations and the Woods did not file suit until eight years after closing the transaction.\n\n\n1. Home-equity liens that do not comply with section 50(a)(6) are voidable.\nThe fundamental question we face today is whether a home-equity lien that violates section 50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution\nis void or voidable. Two courts have recently concluded that constitutionally noncompliant homestead liens are voidable. First,\nlike the Woods, the plaintiffs in Priester obtained a home-equity loan that did not comply with the constitutional requirements.\n708 F.3d at 671. Five years after the transaction closed, the plaintiffs sent a letter to the defendant, which had acquired the loan\nfrom the original lender, requesting cure under section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x). Id. The defendant took no action to cure the perceived\ninfirmities. Id. The plaintiffs then sued the defendants for a declaratory judgment that the loan and lien on their home were void\nab initio, that the defendants had failed to cure, and that the defendants were required to forfeit all principal and interest. Id. In\ndeciding whether a statute of limitations applied to the plaintiffs' claims, the Priester court reasoned:\n\n  The decision in Doody v. Ameriquest Mortgage Co., 49 S.W.3d 342 (Tex.2001), offers indirect support for the applicability\n  of limitations. The court responded to a question certified by this court on the issue of cure, explaining that a lien cured under\n  Section 50(a)(6)(Q) became valid even if it was “invalid” before the cure. Id. at 347. Discussing forfeiture, the court stated\n  that “if a lien that secures such a loan is voided,” the lender loses all rights to recovery. Id. at 346. That language suggests that\n  the Texas Supreme Court considers liens created in violation of Section 50(a)(6) to be voidable rather than void—a “void”\n  lien could not be “voided” by future action.\n\n708 F.3d at 674. The Priester court further noted that “[b]ecause a cure provision exists in Section 50(a)(6)(Q), liens that are\ncontrary to the requirements of § 50(a) are voidable rather than void from the start.” Id. at 674 n. 4. 2\n\n *591 Second, after the Priester decision was issued, the Dallas Court of Appeals faced a similar question in Williams. In\nthat case, the plaintiff's husband took out a loan on the couple's residence and represented himself to be an unmarried man.\nWilliams, 407 S.W.3d at 392. Six years after she discovered the home-equity loan and lien, the plaintiff sought declaratory\njudgment that the home-equity lien was void. Id. at 392–93, 398. The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary\njudgment, which was based in part on the applicability of the four-year residual statute of limitations found in section 16.051\nof the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Id. at 393. The plaintiff argued on appeal that the home-equity lien on her\nhomestead was void because she did not sign the agreement granting the lien or consent to it. Id. at 395; see Tex. Const. art.\nXVI, § 50(a)(6)(A). Finding the Priester court's analysis persuasive, the Williams court held that the noncompliant home-equity\nlien was voidable. Id. at 397.\n\nWe too find the Priester court's analysis persuasive not only because of its sound reasoning, but also because its conclusion\ncomports with Texas Supreme Court precedent on the key distinction between a void act and a voidable act, which is a party's\nability—either through its own action or through the judicial process—to disaffirm, ratify, or confirm a voidable act. See Brazzel\nv. Murray, 481 S.W.2d 801, 803 (Tex.1972) (“A void act is one entirely null within itself, not binding on either party, and which\nis not susceptible of ratification or confirmation.... A voidable act ... is binding until disaffirmed, and ... may be made finally\nvalid by failure within proper time to have it annulled, or by subsequent ratification or confirmation.”); Slaughter v. Qualls, 139\nTex. 340, 162 S.W.2d 671, 674 (1942); Murchison v. White, 54 Tex. 78, 81 (1880); Cummings v. Powell, 8 Tex. 80, 85 (1852);\nsee also Oles v. Curl, 65 S.W.3d 129, 131 n. 1 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2001, no pet.) (“Simply put, if a supposedly void act can be\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 439 S.W.3d 585 (2014)\n\n\nvalidated then the act cannot actually be void.”); In re Moreno, 4 S.W.3d 278, 280–81 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1999,\nno pet.); Bayoud v. Bayoud, 797 S.W.2d 304, 309 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1990, writ denied).\n\nKeeping this distinction in mind, if we were to decide that a noncompliant home-equity lien is void from the start, then the lien\nwould not be susceptible to correction, ratification, confirmation, disaffirmation, or even cure. While this may have been the\ncase prior to the 1997 constitutional amendment that added the section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x) cure provisions, it is not the case now.\nThe 1997 home-equity loan amendment affords lenders the means to correct mistakes in order to validate a noncompliant home-\nequity lien. Doody, 49 S.W.3d at 346 (discussing Collier v. Valley Bldg. & Loan Ass'n, 62 S.W.2d 82, 84 (Tex.Com.App.1933,\nholding approved)). The section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x) cure provisions place noncompliant home-equity liens on the voidable side of\nthe void-voidable scale. 3\n\n *592 Despite the Woods' argument that a plain reading of section 50(c) necessitates finding a constitutionally noncompliant\nlien void, our conclusion is consistent with the rules governing interpretation of the Texas Constitution:\n\n            When interpreting our state constitution, we rely heavily on its literal text and must give effect to its plain\n            language. We strive to give constitutional provisions the effect their makers and adopters intended. We\n            construe constitutional provisions and amendments that relate to the same subject matter together and\n            consider those amendments and provisions in light of each other. And we strive to avoid a construction\n            that renders any provision meaningless or inoperative.\n\nDoody, 49 S.W.3d at 344 (citations omitted). In adhering to these core principles, the Doody court stated:\n\n            [T]he cure provision in section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x) applies to all the lender's obligations under the ‘extension\n            of credit’ including section 50(c)'s requirements that to be valid a homestead must secure a debt described\n            by this section.\n\nId. at 345. Accepting the Woods' position would require us to read section 50(c) in isolation and in contravention of Texas\nSupreme Court precedent, which we decline to do.\n\n[3] Accordingly, we hold that because a cure provision exists in the Texas Constitution, homestead liens that do not comply\nwith the constitutional requirements are voidable. Priester, 708 F.3d at 674; Williams, 407 S.W.3d at 396–97.\n\n\n2. The four-year statute of limitations of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.051 applies to the Woods'\nconstitutional claims.\n [4] Having determined that noncompliant home-equity liens are voidable, and because such liens are subject to limitations,\nwe must decide which statute of limitations applies to the Woods' constitutional claims. “Every action for which there is no\nexpress limitations period, except an action for the recovery of real property, must be brought not later than four years after the\nday the cause of action accrues.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 16.051 (West 2008). Section 50(a)(6) does not contain an\nexpress limitations period. Williams, 407 S.W.3d at 394. Therefore, the Woods' causes of action based on HSBC and Ocwen's\nalleged violations of section 50(a)(6) are subject to the section 16.051 four-year residual statute of limitations.\n\n [5] [6] [7] Anticipating the possibility that section 16.051 would apply to their constitutional claims, the Woods assert that\nsection 16.051 does not apply to their declaratory judgment action to cancel HSBC's lien because it constitutes an action for\nthe recovery of real property. An action for the recovery of real property is one that would support a trespass to try title suit\nwithout first invoking the equitable powers *593 of the court to cancel a deed. Miles v. Martin, 159 Tex. 336, 321 S.W.2d\n62, 69 (1959); Carr v. Weiss, 984 S.W.2d 753, 762 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 1999, pet. denied); see also Neill v.

Amerman, 133 S.W.3d 262, 265 (Tex.2004).\nA declaratory judgment action, on the other hand, provides an efficient procedural method for seeking a declaration of rights\nregarding the construction or validity of deeds by those whose rights are affected by such instruments. Jordan v. Bustamante,\n158 S.W.3d 29, 35 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied).\n\nInitially, we note that the Woods' claim for forfeiture of principal and interest is an action to recover money damages. As such,\nit is not an action for the recovery of real property. Nor is the Woods' declaratory judgment action to void the home-equity lien\n—which does not implicate any of the issues resolved by a trespass to try title suit—an action for the recovery of real property.\nCf. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Groves, No. 14–10–00090–CV, 2011 WL 1364070, at *4 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th\nDist.] Apr. 12, 2011, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (where defendant did not dispute plaintiff's title to property and plaintiff did\nnot dispute defendant's ownership of deed of trust, plaintiff's claim that deed of trust was invalid did not implicate any issues\nresolved by trespass to try title suit).\n\nCiting the general principle that the legal and equitable estates in real property are severed when a mortgagor executes a deed\nof trust, see Flag–Redfern Oil Co. v. Humble Expl. Co., Inc., 744 S.W.2d 6, 8 (Tex.1987), the Woods further contend that their\nsuit to invalidate the home-equity lien is an action to recover “equitable title.” Therefore, it is an action to recover real property.\nThe Woods then cite two cases, MacDonald v. Follett, 142 Tex. 616, 180 S.W.2d 334 (1944), and In re Lemons, 281 S.W.3d\n643 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2009, no pet.), for the proposition that “the Supreme Court has long held that suits for equitable title are\nnot subject to the 4–year residual statute of limitations.”\n\nWe reject the Woods' argument. In MacDonald, the plaintiff brought an action in trespass to try title seeking to impose a\nconstructive trust on the legal title to real property acquired by the defendant through an alleged breach of fiduciary duty. 180\nS.W.2d at 335–36. The Texas Supreme Court held that if the plaintiff could successfully establish a relationship of trust and\nconfidence with the defendant, then the four-year statute of limitations would not apply to the plaintiff's suit because it would\nbe an action to recover real property. Id. at 338. In Lemons, the plaintiff sued to impose a constructive trust on the legal title to\nreal property purchased by the defendant with funds that were removed from the plaintiff's bank account without authority. 281\nS.W.3d at 645. The defendant moved to transfer venue under section 15.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Id.\nat 646. Section 15.011 is a mandatory venue provision stating that “[a]ctions for recovery of real property ... shall be brought in\nthe county in which all or a part of the property is located.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 15.011 (West 2002); Lemons,\n281 S.W.3d at 646. The Tyler Court of Appeals held that *594 section 15.011 applied to the plaintiff's claim because “a suit\nto impose a constructive trust on real property is a suit for the recovery of real property.” Lemons, 281 S.W.3d at 647.\n\nBased on the context provided by the facts of MacDonald and Lemons, the more accurate proposition is that suits for equitable\ntitle by reason of a constructive trust are not subject to the four-year residual statute of limitations because a beneficiary's\ninterest under a constructive trust will support an action in trespass to try title. See Binford v. Snyder, 144 Tex. 134, 189 S.W.2d\n471, 476 (1945); Grunwald v. Grunwald, 487 S.W.2d 240, 245 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1972, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Gates\nv. Coquat, 210 S.W.2d 614, 615 (Tex.Civ.App.-San Antonio 1948, no writ).\n\nHere, the Woods are not attempting to impose a constructive trust on the home-equity lien and do not allege that HSBC has\nacquired legal title through wrongdoing. To the contrary, the Woods have merely asserted a cause of action to cancel their\nhome-equity lien, which will not support an action in trespass to try title and which requires the equitable powers of the court to\ndetermine. Cf. Neill, 101 S.W.2d at 403 (“[P]laintiffs' action [to cancel the voidable deeds] rests upon equitable title, assertion\nof which requires the aid of a court of equity to determine, thus the action is not one to recover real estate but one to remove\nthe impediment to such title, and is barred by the [article 5529, now section 16.051] statute of limitation....”); Johnson v. Wood,\n138 Tex. 106, 157 S.W.2d 146, 148 (Tex.Com.App.1941) (a cause of action to cancel a conveyance will not support an action\nin trespass to try title); see also Groves, 2011 WL 1364070, at *4 (declaratory judgment action to cancel deed of trust did not\nimplicate issues resolved by trespass to try title suit).\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 439 S.W.3d 585 (2014)\n\n\nBecause the Woods' declaratory judgment action to cancel their home-equity lien would not support a trespass to try title action\nand requires the equitable powers of the court to cancel their lien, their declaratory judgment action to cancel the home-equity\nlien is not an action to recover real property.\n\nWe conclude that the section 16.051 four-year statute of limitations applies to the Woods' constitutional claims.\n\n\n3. The Woods' constitutional claims accrued on July 2, 2004, the date the home-equity transaction closed.\n [8] [9] [10] We now address whether HSBC and Ocwen conclusively proved when the Woods' cause of action accrued.\nGenerally, a cause of action accrues when a wrongful act causes a legal injury. Etan Indus., Inc. v. Lehmann, 359 S.W.3d\n620, 623 (Tex.2011); Williams, 407 S.W.3d at 398. In cases involving a challenge to the validity of a home-equity lien on\nconstitutional grounds, the legal injury occurs on the date the transaction closes. Priester, 708 F.3d at 676; Williams, 407\nS.W.3d at 398; Rivera v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 262 S.W.3d 834, 840 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.); Schanzle v.\nJPMC Specialty Mortg. LLC, No. 03–09–00639–CV, 2011 WL 832170, at *4 (Tex.App.-Austin Mar. 11, 2011, no pet.) (mem.\nop.). Here, the Woods are challenging the validity of the home-equity lien on constitutional grounds. Therefore, the Woods'\nconstitutional claims accrued on July 2, 2004, the date the Woods' home-equity loan closed.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, we reject the Woods' alternative arguments for a later accrual date. The Woods initially rely on\nDessommes v. Dessommes, 543 S.W.2d 165 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.), in support of their position *595\nthat no controversy arose with respect to their declaratory judgment action until HSBC failed to cure. Essentially, the Woods\nargue that, for purposes of determining the accrual date, their legal injury did not occur until the sixty-day period for cure\nexpired. See Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 50(a)(6)(Q)(x). However, Dessommes simply restates the general principle that a statute\nof limitations begins to run when facts come into existence authorizing a party to seek a judicial remedy, i.e., when the legal\ninjury occurs. 543 S.W.2d at 169 (citing Williams v. Pure Oil Co., 124 Tex. 341, 78 S.W.2d 929, 931 (1935)); see also Knott,\n128 S.W.3d at 221.\n\nWe have already held that the legal injury in this case occurred when the transaction closed on July 2, 2004. The facts that\nwould have alerted the Woods to potential constitutional violations—e.g., fees exceeding three percent of the loan amount—\nexisted when the transaction closed, as did their right to seek a judicial remedy for those violations. Furthermore, nothing in\nthe Texas Constitution prevented the Woods from initiating their declaratory judgment action as soon as the transaction closed.\nSee Priester, 708 F.3d at 675 n. 6 (“[T]here is nothing in the Texas Constitution that suggests that the borrower must seek\ncure before filing suit.”).\n\n [11] The Woods next argue that the statute of limitations was tolled because of HSBC's “continuing and ongoing violations”\nof the Texas Constitution. The Woods did not explain or cite any legal authority in support of their contention. This issue is\ntherefore inadequately briefed. See Tex.R.App. P. 38.1(i); In re S.A.H., 420 S.W.3d 911, 929 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n2014, no pet.). Because we conclude that the Woods have waived error on this particular argument, we decline to address it. 4\n\nIn sum, because a cure provision exists in the Texas Constitution, homestead liens that do not comply with the constitutional\nrequirements are voidable. The section 16.051 four-year residual statute of limitations applies to the Woods' constitutional\nclaims, and their constitutional claims are not actions for the recovery of real property. The Woods' constitutional claims accrued\nwhen the home-equity transaction closed on July 2, 2004. The Woods had until July 2, 2008, to file their petition. The Woods\ndid not file their original petition until July 9, 2012.\n\nWith regard to the Woods' constitutional claims, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting HSBC's motion for\nsummary judgment on limitations grounds. The Woods' first sub-issue is overruled. 5\n\n\n*596 B.

HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 439 S.W.3d 585 (2014)\n\n\n [12] The Woods alleged in their second amended petition that HSBC and Ocwen breached paragraph 13 of the security\nagreement that created the home-equity lien by charging fees exceeding three percent of the loan amount, in violation of section\n50(a)(6)(E) of the Texas Constitution. 6 The Woods contend on appeal that because notice is a prerequisite to filing suit under\nthe security instrument, 7 their cause of action for breach of contract did not accrue until March 16, 2012, the date they sent\nHSBC notice of the alleged constitutional violations. HSBC and Ocwen respond that the Woods' breach-of-contract claim is\nbarred by limitations because the Woods filed suit more than four years after their claim accrued on July 2, 2004, when the\ntransaction closed.\n\n [13] [14] [15] The limitations period for a breach-of-contract cause of action is four years. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\nAnn. § 16.051; Stine v. Stewart, 80 S.W.3d 586, 592 (Tex.2002). A claim for breach of contract accrues when the contract is\nbreached. Barker v. Eckman, 213 S.W.3d 306, 311 (Tex.2006); Stine, 80 S.W.3d at 592. Generally, when demand is a condition\nprecedent to the right to sue, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until demand is made, unless the demand is waived\nor unreasonably delayed. Gabriel v. Alhabbal, 618 S.W.2d 894, 896 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n            Where demand is a prerequisite to a right of action, the injured party must make the demand within\n            a reasonable time after it may lawfully be made.... The reasonableness of the delay is normally a fact\n            question, but in the absence of mitigating circumstances, the law will ordinarily consider a reasonable\n            time as being coincident with the running of the statute, and an action will be barred if a demand is not\n            made within that period.\n\nBarnes v. LPP Mortg., Ltd., 358 S.W.3d 301, 306 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, pet. denied) (quoting Stevens v. State Farm Fire &\nCas. Co., 929 S.W.2d 665, 671 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 1996, writ denied)).\n\n *597 Assuming, for the sake of argument, that HSBC did in fact breach the security agreement by charging fees in excess of\nthree percent of the loan amount, the breach occurred on the date the excessive fees were charged. The Woods referred to certain\nitemized charges in the HUD–1 settlement statement as evidence that HSBC assessed excessive fees. 8 The HUD–1 identified\nthe settlement date as July 2, 2004, which coincides with the closing date of the transaction. Therefore, the alleged excessive\nfees were charged, and the Woods' breach-of-contract claim accrued, on July 2, 2004. Absent mitigating circumstances, the\nWoods had until July 2, 2008, to demand cure and file their breach-of-contract cause of action. The Woods did not demand\ncure until March 16, 2012, and they did not file their original petition until July 9, 2012. The Woods did not allege in their live\npetition any mitigating circumstances to justify waiting nearly eight years to demand cure.\n\nTherefore, with regard to the Woods' breach-of-contract claim, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting HSBC\nand Ocwen's motion for summary judgment on limitations grounds. The Woods' second sub-issue is overruled.\n\n\n\n                                                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of HSBC and Ocwen on limitations grounds. We overrule\nboth of the Woods' sub-issues on appeal and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      The Woods have abandoned their challenge to the no-evidence summary judgment in favor of HSBC and Ocwen on the fraud claim\n       because the Woods have not raised the fraud issue on appeal.

Mar. 29, 2012).\n3     The Woods cite Collier, in support of the proposition that the Doody court created a new “void but curable” status for section 50(a)\n      (6) home-equity liens. Collier stands for the proposition that an invalid lien cannot be ratified unless the authority to ratify it exists\n      under our Constitution or statutes. Collier v. Valley Bldg. & Loan Ass'n, 62 S.W.2d 82, 84 (Tex.Com.App.1933, holding approved).\n      Referring to Collier, the Doody court made clear that the 1997 home-equity loan amendment affords lenders the authority to ratify\n      an invalid lien. Doody, 49 S.W.3d at 346. The Doody court's statement supports our conclusion that constitutionally noncompliant\n      liens are voidable.\n         The Woods' further reliance on York v. State, 373 S.W.3d 32 (Tex.2012), in support of their “void but curable” argument is also\n         misplaced. The York court held that a judgment that violates a bankruptcy automatic stay is void unless a federal bankruptcy court\n         modifies the stay. Id. at 40. The Woods' situation is distinguishable because the lender in a home-equity transaction has the ability\n         under our Constitution to cure the noncompliant lien without the involvement of the federal judiciary or any other third party.\n         Furthermore, the Texas Supreme Court has noted that the rationale for classifying judgments in violation of an automatic stay\n         as void was that bankruptcy law vests “exclusive jurisdiction” in the bankruptcy courts. See Roccaforte v. Jefferson Cnty., 341\n         S.W.3d 919, 923 (Tex.2011) (citing Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U.S. 433, 60 S.Ct. 343, 84 L.Ed. 370 (1940)). That rationale does\n         not apply to the present case.\n4     The Woods pleaded two alternative tolling theories in their second amended petition—the discovery rule and equitable tolling. Both\n      theories were addressed in HSBC and Ocwen's motion for summary judgment and in the Woods' response to HSBC and Ocwen's\n      motion for summary judgment. The Woods did not raise these theories on appeal and have therefore abandoned them. See Tex.R.App.\n      P. 38.1(f), 47.1; Shafaii Children's Trust, 417 S.W.3d at 622 n. 6; Martinez, 218 S.W.3d at 844 (“When reviewing a civil matter,\n      an appellate court has no discretion to consider an issue not raised in the appellant's brief, even if the ends of justice so require.”);\n      see also Clonts, 294 S.W. at 846.\n5     In an additional argument against the applicability of a statute of limitations to their constitutional claims, the Woods characterize\n      their declaratory judgment action as a defense to foreclosure. According to the Woods, because defenses are not governed by the\n      statutes of limitations, their declaratory judgment action is not barred by limitations. We have indicated in the foreclosure context\n      that a lender's failure to comply with the constitutional requirements is in the nature of an affirmative defense. Wilson v. Aames\n      Capital Corp., No. 14–06–00524–CV, 2007 WL 3072054, at *1 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] Oct. 23, 2007, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n      However, potential defendants like the Woods cannot “use a declaratory judgment to prematurely adjudicate defenses to liability that\n      may not yet exist.” Transcon. Realty Investors, Inc. v. Orix Capital Mkts., LLC, 353 S.W.3d 241, 245 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, pet.\n      denied) (citing Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740, 748, 118 S.Ct. 1694, 140 L.Ed.2d 970 (1998), for the proposition that under the\n      federal constitution, a party cannot use a declaratory judgment to obtain an advance ruling on an affirmative defense). Nothing in the\n      record before us indicates that the Woods were actually faced with foreclosure; thus, their liability may not yet exist, and because\n      we are prohibited from issuing advisory opinions, Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex.1993), we\n      decline to treat the Woods' declaratory judgment action as a defense to foreclosure.\n6     Paragraph 13 of the security agreement reads, in pertinent part: “Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this\n      Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.” The term “Applicable Law” is defined as “all controlling applicable ... state and local\n      statutes ....”\n7     Paragraph 19 of the security agreement states, in pertinent part:\n            Neither Borrower nor Lender may commence ... any judicial action ... that arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this\n            Security Instrument or that alleges that the other party has breached any provision of, or any duty owed by reason of, this Security\n            Instrument, until such Borrower or Lender has notified the other party ... of such alleged breach and afforded the other party\n            hereto a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action.\n8     For purposes of the HUD–1, “settlement means the process of executing legally binding documents regarding a lien on property that\n      is subject to a federally related mortgage loan. This process may also be called ‘closing’ or ‘escrow’ in different jurisdictions.” 24\n      C.F.R. § 3500.2(b) (2014).\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Unless the law or these rules provide otherwise, a judgment debtor may supersede the judgment by:\n\n\n  (1) filing with the trial court clerk a written agreement with the judgment creditor for suspending enforcement of the judgment;\n\n\n  (2) filing with the trial court clerk a good and sufficient bond;\n\n\n  (3) making a deposit with the trial court clerk in lieu of a bond; or\n\n\n  (4) providing alternate security ordered by the court.\n\n\n(b) Bonds.\n\n\n  (1) A bond must be:\n\n\n     (A) in the amount required by 24.2;\n\n\n     (B) payable to the judgment creditor;\n\n\n     (C) signed by the judgment debtor or the debtor's agent;\n\n\n     (D) signed by a sufficient surety or sureties as obligors; and\n\n\n     (E) conditioned as required by (d).\n\n\n  (2) To be effective a bond must be approved by the trial court clerk. On motion of any party, the trial court will review\n  the bond.\n\n\n(c) Deposit in Lieu of Bond.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Instead of filing a surety bond, a party may deposit with the trial court clerk:\n\n\n     (A) cash;\n\n\n     (B) a cashier's check payable to the clerk, drawn on any federally insured and federally or state-chartered bank or savings-\n     and-loan association; or\n\n\n     (C) with leave of court, a negotiable obligation of the federal government or of any federally insured and federally or state-\n     chartered bank or savings-and-loan association.\n\n\n  (2) Amount of Deposit. The deposit must be in the amount required by 24.2.\n\n\n  (3) Clerk's Duties; Interest. The clerk must promptly deposit any cash or a cashier's check in accordance with law. The clerk\n  must hold the deposit until the conditions of liability in (d) are extinguished. The clerk must then release any remaining funds\n  in the deposit to the judgment debtor.\n\n\n(d) Conditions of Liability. The surety or sureties on a bond, any deposit in lieu of a bond, or any alternate security ordered\nby the court is subject to liability for all damages and costs that may be awarded against the debtor--up to the amount of the\nbond, deposit, or security--if:\n\n\n  (1) the debtor does not perfect an appeal or the debtor's appeal is dismissed, and the debtor does not perform the trial court's\n  judgment;\n\n\n  (2) the debtor does not perform an adverse judgment final on appeal; or\n\n\n  (3) the judgment is for the recovery of an interest in real or personal property, and the debtor does not pay the creditor the\n  value of the property interest's rent or revenue during the pendency of the appeal.\n\n\n(e) Orders of Trial Court. The trial court may make any order necessary to adequately protect the judgment creditor against\nloss or damage that the appeal might cause.\n\n\n(f) Effect of Supersedeas. Enforcement of a judgment must be suspended if the judgment is superseded. Enforcement begun\nbefore the judgment is superseded must cease when the judgment is superseded. If execution has been issued, the clerk will\npromptly issue a writ of supersedeas.\n\n\nCredits\nEff. Sept. 1, 1997.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

.................................................................................... ix \nIssues Presented......................................................................................................................... x \nStatement of Facts ..................................................................................................................... 1 \n           A.         The parties enter into a highly negotiated and agreed temporary\n                      injunction. ........................................................................................................... 1 \n           B.         For months, DeLitta acknowledges the binding force of the agreed\n                      injunction and even seeks enforcement of its terms. ................................... 1 \n           C.         DeLitta retains new counsel who attempts to declare the agreed\n                      injunction void.................................................................................................... 3 \n           D.         When the trial court enforces the Agreed Order as both an\n                      injunction and a Rule 11 agreement, DeLitta seeks review from this\n                      Court, without success. ..................................................................................... 4 \n           E.         Undeterred, DeLitta tries to take another bite at the apple in the\n                      trial court. ............................................................................................................ 5 \nSummary of Argument ............................................................................................................. 6 \nArgument .................................................................................................................................... 7 \n\nI.         On appeal from a denial of a motion to dissolve, an appellate court has\n           no jurisdiction to review the validity of the original temporary injunction. ......... 7 \n\nII.        Litigants should be able to dispense with the formal requirements of Rule\n           683 and enter into an agreed temporary injunction without fear that one\n           party to the agreed order will later attempt to declare the order void................. 10 \n           A.         Neither this Court nor the Texas Supreme Court has held an agreed\n                      injunction void for failure to strictly comply with Rule 683, yet\n                      other appellate courts are split on the issue. ................................................ 11 \n\n\n                                                                       ii\n\f          B.         The cases DeLitta cites are distinguishable. ................................................. 15 \n          C.         Cases that appear to prohibit agreed temporary injunctions\n                     misconstrue Texas Supreme Court precedent and are not soundly\n                     reasoned............................................................................................................. 17 \n          D.         DeLitta is estopped from now challenging the Agreed Order\n                     because he agreed to its issuance and has himself sought to enforce\n                     it. ......................................................................................................................... 22 \n\nIII.      The trial court was within its discretion to deny DeLitta’s motion because\n          the Agreed Order is enforceable as a Rule 11 Agreement. ................................... 24 \n          A.         The Texas Supreme Court allows enforcement of litigation-related\n                     agreements under Rule 11 even when the agreement might not\n                     otherwise be enforceable as an agreed judgment. ....................................... 25 \n          B.         The Agreed Order meets all the elements of an enforceable Rule\n                     11.

His tactics resulted in\n                              several appellate proceedings, all of which failed.3\n\n                              Undeterred, on October 22, 2014, DeLitta made yet another\n                              attempt to renege, this time by filing a Motion to Dissolve\n                              and Declare Temporary Injunction Void.4\n\nTrial Court:                  The Honorable Amy Meachum, 201st District Court, Travis\n                              County, Texas.\n\nTrial Court Disposition:      The trial court signed an order denying DeLitta’s motion on\n                              January 16, 2015.5 The order does not state the reasons for\n                              its issuance.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Appellants in this appeal are Michael J. DeLitta and DelCom Properties, LLC only and will be\nreferred to in this brief as simply “DeLitta.”\n2\n  Exh. A to Brief of Appellant; see also CR115–23\n3\n  See No. 03-14-00423-CV (original proceeding seeking to declare injunction void, denied on July 11,\n2014); No. 03-14-00426-CV (appeal of an order enforcing the terms of the injunction dismissed for\nlack of jurisdiction on November 6, 2014). DeLitta also appealed an order appointing a receiver over\nAxiom, No. 03-13-000425-CV, which was dismissed for failure to prosecute on October 17, 2014.\n4\n  CR329–48\n5\n  CR379–81\n\n\n                                                viii\n\f                    STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n      Appellee does not believe oral argument is necessary for the Court to fully\n\nunderstand and properly resolve this appeal. This is an interlocutory appeal from an\n\norder denying Appellants’ Motion to Dissolve and Declare Temporary Injunction Void.\n\nThe relevant facts are undisputed, and the law is not difficult to grasp. However, to the\n\nextent that the Court has remaining questions after reviewing the briefing, Appellee\n\nwould gladly participate in any oral argument to answer those questions.\n\n\n\n\n                                           ix\n\f                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\n1. Does this Court have jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order signed in October\n2013—over 15 months before this appeal was perfected—when the sole complaint on\nappeal concerns the validity of the original injunction, not a trial court’s failure to\ndissolve based on changed circumstances?\n\n2. The parties negotiated an agreed temporary injunction to govern their conduct\nthrough trial, signed the temporary injunction with the notation “agreed as to form and\nsubstance,” and submitted it to the judge for approval.\n\n   a. Does omitting the reasons for issuance make an agreed temporary injunction\n      void when all the parties understand that the injunction was issued because it was\n      agreed?\n\n   b. Does a subsequent agreed continuance of the trial date stated in the injunction\n      make an injunction retroactively void?\n\n   c. Does a party waive the right to challenge a temporary injunction for failing to\n      comply with Rule 683 by agreeing to the injunction in the first instance, by not\n      appealing it, and/or by themselves seeking to enforce it?\n\n3.    May a trial court refuse to dissolve an agreed temporary injunction because the\nagreed order meets all the requirement of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and is thus\nenforceable in contract?\n\n\n\n\n                                           x\n\f                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n      This is a business dispute over the ownership of Axiom Medical Consulting,\n\nLLC.6 Schaefer and DeLitta are two managers and members of Axiom who each\n\ncontrol 50% of the company.7 The relationship between the two deteriorated and, in\n\nOctober 2013, Schaefer filed suit seeking to confirm her ownership in Axiom and, to\n\nmaintain her status quo within the company, obtained a temporary restraining order.8\n\nA.    The parties enter into a highly negotiated and agreed temporary\n      injunction.\n      Before the restraining order dissolved, the parties requested the trial court\n\napprove a highly negotiated consent order and agreement which was entitled a\n\n“temporary injunction” (the “Agreed Order”).9 The Agreed Order was signed on\n\nOctober 29, 2013.10 It prohibited the parties from undertaking certain acts and also\n\nobligated the parties to file a joint motion for appointment of a provisional member to\n\nbreak deadlock between Schaefer and DeLitta.11\n\nB.    For months, DeLitta acknowledges the binding force of the agreed\n      injunction and even seeks enforcement of its terms.\n      The parties proceeded for over eight months in this litigation under the terms of\n\nthe Agreed Order and in full acknowledgement of its binding force. For example,\n\nmonths after its issuance, on March 13, 2014, DeLitta filed a motion titled “Motion to\n\n6\n  CR134–36\n7\n  CR132\n8\n  CR3\n9\n  CR115\n10\n   CR121\n11\n   CR122\n\n                                          1\n\fEnforce, Modify and/or Dissolve Certain Provisions of the Temporary Injunction.”12\n\nAs the title implies, the motion sought to enforce certain provisions of the injunction.\n\nThe motion was heard, along with a competing enforcement motion by Schaefer,13 on\n\nApril 14, 2014—after the April 7, 2014 trial date set in the Agreed Order.14 Ultimately,\n\nDeLitta’s motion was denied and Schaefer’s motion granted.15 The order was signed\n\nApril 21, 2014.16\n\n       Around the same time, DeLitta filed a “Joint Application for TRO and Motion\n\nto Rescind the Order Appointing a Provisional Member.”17 The motion sought to limit\n\nthe powers of the provisional member who was appointed and selected under the terms\n\nof the Agreed Order. By filing this motion, DeLitta again acknowledged the binding\n\nforce of the Agreed Order. The application and motion were denied.18\n\n       No interlocutory appeals were taken from any of these orders. DeLitta never\n\nchallenged the validity of the injunction or sought to declare the injunction void through\n\nthese motions.

DeLitta retains new counsel who attempts to declare the agreed injunction\n        void.\n        The dispute between Schaefer and DeLitta continued to escalate through the\n\nSpring of 2014. Despite repeated judicial refusal to modify or dissolve the terms of the\n\ninjunction, DeLitta still snubbed the agreed terms. Schaefer filed a second motion to\n\nenforce on May 16, 2014, this time seeking the appointment of a receiver over certain\n\naspects of the company’s financial operations, as well as enforcement of the Agreed\n\nOrder.19\n\n        Shortly before the day of the hearing on Schaefer’s motion, new counsel\n\nappeared20 and, the day of the hearing, filed a written response in opposition to the\n\nmotion to enforce and motion for contempt.21 The response argued (for the first time)\n\nthat the original injunction was “void,” “expired as a matter of law,” and thus could not\n\nform the basis of a contempt order.22 The response contained no allegation of changed\n\ncircumstances that would justify re-litigation of issues.23\n\n        Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court signed an order enforcing the\n\nAgreed Order on June 19, 2014.24 The order expressly found it was being enforced, not\n\njust as a temporary injunction, but also as a Rule 11 agreement.25 The court found that\n\n19\n   SuppCR124\n20\n   CR641\n21\n   SuppRR37\n22\n   Id.\n23\n   SuppRR37–47\n24\n   SuppCR191–93\n25\n   SuppCR192 (finding that the Agreed Order “is an agreed order approved as to ‘form and content’\nby all parties, signed by the court and filed in the clerk’s office” and “is enforceable as a court order\nand as a Rule 11 agreement between the parties”)\n\n                                                   3\n\fDeLitta had willfully violated the Agreed Order through several specifically enumerated\n\nacts.26    Further, although it “had the authority to enforce the Agreed order by\n\ncontempt,” it “declin[ed] to do so.”27 The trial court reiterated, however, that “all parties\n\n[shall] strictly abide by the terms of the” Agreed Order.28 The Court also, by separate\n\norder, appointed a partial receiver over Axiom.29\n\nD.        When the trial court enforces the Agreed Order as both an injunction and\n          a Rule 11 agreement, DeLitta seeks review from this Court, without\n          success.\n          Three appeals followed. DeLitta filed two interlocutory appeals: one appeal of\n\nthe June 19, 2014 enforcement order30 and one appeal of the order appointing the\n\nreceiver.31 DeLitta also filed a petition for writ of mandamus, seeking to vacate the\n\nOctober 2013 agreed temporary injunction.32\n\n          None of the appeals were successful. The Court denied the mandamus petition33\n\nand dismissed the interlocutory appeal of the enforcement order for want of\n\njurisdiction.34 DeLitta abandoned the receivership appeal.35\n\n\n\n\n26\n   Id.\n27\n   Id.\n28\n   Id.

Undeterred, DeLitta tries to take another bite at the apple in the trial court.\n       Three appellate losses did not deter DeLitta. By December, he was back before\n\nanother Travis County district judge seeking to dissolve the Agreed Order.36 Essentially\n\ncutting and pasting from his failed briefing to this Court, DeLitta argued that the Agreed\n\nOrder was void because it did not comply with the mandatory requirements of Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure 683 and 684.37 DeLitta’s motion was silent to the fact that the\n\nAgreed Order had already been determined to be an enforceable Rule 11 agreement.38\n\nNor did the motion contain any allegations of changed circumstances that would justify\n\nre-litigation of the various issues.39\n\n       The trial court denied DeLitta’s motion on January 16, 2015, without stating the\n\nreasons.40 This appeal followed.41\n\n\n\n\n36\n   See RR (transcript of Dec. 15, 2014, hearing on DeLitta’s Motion to Dissolve and Declare Temporary\nInjunction Void, which was filed on Oct. 22, 2014).\n37\n   CR329–37\n38\n   See generally id.\n39\n   SuppRR37–47\n40\n   CR379\n41\n   CR632\n\n                                                 5\n\f                               SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n      DeLitta voluntarily agreed to restraints on his conduct, by signing a highly\n\nnegotiated Agreed Temporary Injunction under the notation “agreed as to form and\n\ncontent,” while Schaefer pursued her claims concerning the ownership of Axiom. He\n\nsought the benefit of the Agreed Order, when it behooved him to do so, by twice\n\nmoving to enforce the terms of the order. Yet he has spent the majority of the last year\n\nhoping desperately that the judiciary will allow him to renege on his promise. No judge\n\nhas let him off the hook yet. Nor should this Court.\n\n      DeLitta’s main argument is that the Agreed Order is void for failing to state the\n\nreasons for its issuance, a requirement for court-imposed temporary injunctions under\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 683. This argument makes no sense. A party should not\n\nbe able to “void” an order for failing to state the reason for its issuance when the reason\n\nthe trial court entered the order was because the parties asked it to.\n\n      DeLitta insists the Agreed Order is void because, otherwise, he loses under a\n\nmyriad of equitable principles. His consent to the order removed any alleged error in\n\nit. He has twice pursued the benefits of the injunctive terms, so he is estopped from\n\nchallenging the order now. And he waited too long to appeal.\n\n      But the Court need not reach any of these issues. The trial court previously\n\nenforced the Agreed Order as a Rule 11 Agreement.               Rule 11 agreements are\n\nenforceable in contract even if they would not be enforceable as a judgment. The trial\n\ncourt’s refusal to dissolve the Agreed Order may be affirmed on this ground alone.\n\n\n                                            6\n\f                                       ARGUMENT\nI.    On appeal from a denial of a motion to dissolve, an appellate court has no\n      jurisdiction to review the validity of the original temporary injunction.\n      The Court should dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nAppellate courts consider their interlocutory jurisdiction “narrow” and thus “strictly\n\napply statutes granting interlocutory appeals.” CMH Homes v.

Unlike most\n\ninterlocutory appeals of an order refusing to dissolve a temporary injunction, DeLitta\n\ndid not allege changed circumstances that warrant the injunction’s dissolution.\n\nTherefore, DeLitta does not seek review of the exercise of discretion to dissolve an\n\ninjunction. Instead, DeLitta seeks review of the original injunction itself. This Court\n\nsimply has no jurisdiction to review that order.\n\n       The Court decided the issue just over 30 years ago in Tober v. Turner of Texas, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388839\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388839/tober-v-turner-of-texas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Austin 1984, no writ). The trial court in Tober signed a\n\ntemporary injunction on October 11, 1982. Id. at 833. The following month, on\n\nNovember 16, 1982, and after the time for filing an interlocutory appeal for immediate\n\nreview of the injunction, Tober (the party restrained) sought to “set aside” the\n\ntemporary injunction. Id. Soon thereafter, on December 1, 1982, the trial court signed\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fan order overruling Tober’s motion (apparently treating it as a motion to dissolve the\n\ntemporary injunction). Id.\n\n      Tober appealed, purporting to challenge both the December 1 order and the\n\noriginal November 16 injunction. Id. This Court, construing its jurisdiction narrowly,\n\nrebuffed Tober’s tactic. The Court started by noting that Tober did not timely perfect\n\nan appeal from the original injunction and, as such, the Court had no jurisdiction to\n\nreview it. Id. at 833–34. The Court also refused to consider any issues that touched on\n\nthe propriety of the initial grant of the injunction. Id. at 834. Doing so, it reasoned,\n\nwould allow a party to circumvent Section 51.014:\n\n      If a litigant is permitted, upon motion to dissolve, to again challenge the\n      original temporary injunction grant, without an allegation of changed\n      conditions, then the litigant could accomplish indirectly what he could not\n      directly do . . . thereby render meaningless the appellate timetable\n      applicable to accelerated appeals. . . . [A] litigant, after unsuccessfully\n      opposing a temporary injunction, could wait for an indefinite period to\n      perfect an appeal of the grant of the temporary injunction (by filing a\n      subsequent motion to dissolve, which raises the points of error which\n      could have, and should have, been raised in a direct appeal of the order\n      granting temporary injunction).\n\nId. at 835. The Court was adamant: “[a] motion to dissolve may not be used as a means\n\nof evading or expanding the rules applicable to appealing interlocutory orders.” Id.\n\nThus, unless a temporary injunction order is timely appealed, appellate courts “must\n\npresume the trial court’s initial decision to grant the temporary injunction was proper.”\n\nMurphy v.

The Court’s jurisdiction to\n\nreview the validity of the agreed temporary injunction has long ago expired. See Desai,\n\n813 S.W.2d at 641. This appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nII.       Litigants should be able to dispense with the formal requirements of Rule\n          683 and enter into an agreed temporary injunction without fear that one\n          party to the agreed order will later attempt to declare the order void.\n          DeLitta argues that the October 2013 Agreed Temporary Injunction is void\n\nbecause it does not state the reasons for its issuance and because the trial date stated in\n\nthe Agreed Order has now expired.44 It is “irrelevant,” DeLitta asserts, that the\n\ninjunction was agreed to.45\n\n          The ramifications of DeLitta’s position, if accepted by this Court, are\n\nmomentous. Agreed temporary injunctions are entered in Texas state courts almost\n\ndaily. The reason for their issuance need not be stated; they are issued because they\n\nare agreed. And rarely would opposing counsel agree to an injunction that stated any\n\n\n\n\n44\n     Br. at 12-14\n45\n     Br. at 15\n\n                                            10\n\fother reason for its issuance, as certainly it is not good strategy to concede that the\n\nproponent of the temporary injunction will otherwise suffer harm at your hands.\n\n      Texas law has run amuck on this point. A careful study of supreme court\n\nprecedent will lead the Court to the logical holding that parties can agree to a temporary\n\ninjunction that does not meet all the requirements of Rule 683 and, once agreed, the\n\nparties waive their right to challenge the propriety of the injunction absent fraud,\n\ncollusion, or misrepresentation.\n\nA.    Neither this Court nor the Texas Supreme Court has held an agreed\n      injunction void for failure to strictly comply with Rule 683, yet other\n      appellate courts are split on the issue.\n      The requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 are, Schaefer concedes,\n\n“mandatory and must be strictly followed” when a court enters a contested temporary\n\ninjunction.

But the Texas Supreme Court has never intimated that parties\n\ncannot agree to the entry of a temporary injunction that does not fully comport with\n\nRule 683.\n\n      DeLitta cites several appellate court decisions for the controversial proposition\n\nthat “Rule 683’s mandatory requirements are, in fact, mandatory—and cannot be\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fwaived.”46 But he sweeps under the rug the split of authority on the issue—perhaps a\n\nsign that he does not want to defend the cases he cites.\n\n       A persuasive case on all fours is Cleere v.

The parties agreed to the entry of an injunction. Years\n\nlater, on appeal, the party restrained by the temporary injunction argued it was void for\n\nfailing to comply with Rule 683. As here, the party complained the agreed injunction\n\ndid not state the reasons for its issuance. The Dallas court was unpersuaded:\n\n       Although the reasons are not specified in the order, this defect does not\n       invalidate the injunction under the circumstances shown here. The\n       purpose of the requirement for reasons is to inform the violator of why\n       he is enjoined. When a party agrees to an injunction, he is in no position\n       to complain that he was not informed of the reasons.\n\nId. at 833 (citations omitted). In other words, a party cannot void an order for failing\n\nto state the reasons for its issuance when the reason the order was entered was simply\n\nbecause the parties asked it to. By agreeing to an injunction, and joining in the motion\n\nto enter it, as DeLitta did here, any complaints about the injunction are waived.\n\n       Another court of appeals likewise found waiver in Henke v.

App.—Austin 1984, no writ) and its progeny. As explained\n\npreviously,53 this line of cases holds that unless the original temporary injunction is\n\ntimely appealed, an appellate court—on review of a subsequent order related to the\n\noriginal injunction—will presume that the trial court’s initial decision to grant the\n\ntemporary injunction was proper and will not consider any issues that could have been\n\nraised in a prior appeal. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835; see also Desai, 813 S.W.2d at 641 (no\n\njurisdiction to review original temporary injunction that failed to include trial date). In\n\nGarza, the allegedly void injunction had been entered two years prior, with no appeal\n\ntaken. 126 S.W.3d at 270. The objection that the injunction was void was not raised\n\nuntil the denial of a second round of competing motions to dissolve and for contempt.\n\nId. Thus, pursuant to Tober, this Court would likely have denied the Garza petition on\n\nthis ground alone.\n\n           But Garza is wrong for other reasons too. Garza held that a temporary injunction\n\nthat does not comply with Rules 683 and 684 is void, not voidable, and, as such, a party\n\ndoes not waive its right to attack the injunction—even if the party agreed to its issuance.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Garza court relied heavily on two per curiam opinions\n\nfrom the Texas Supreme Court: Qwest, 24 S.W.3d at 334; Interfirst, 715 S.W.2d at 641.\n\n\n\n53\n     See infra, Sec. I.\n\n                                                18\n\f       Importantly, however, neither Qwest nor Interfirst concerned an agreed temporary\n\ninjunction. Interfirst is a two-paragraph opinion that mentions nothing about the entry\n\nof the injunction. In Qwest, the parties reached a tentative agreement concerning the\n\ninjunction at the entry hearing, which they then read into the record, but “[u]ltimately,\n\nthe parties could not agree to the terms of the written order to be submitted to the trial\n\ncourt.” 23 S.W.3d at 335. So neither opinion addressed whether parties may agree to\n\ndispense with the requirements of Rule 683 and 684. In fact, the Qwest court stated that\n\nthe “single issue in this petition is whether the trial court’s interlocutory order is a\n\ntemporary injunction.” Id. Anything the Court wrote about the voidability of an\n\ninjunction was not relevant to the “single issue” before it and was thus dicta.\n\n       Equally critical is the actual language used in Qwest and Interfirst. In both cases,\n\nthe court stated that an order that does not adhere to the requirements of the injunction\n\nrules “is subject to being declared void and dissolved.” Qwest, 24 S.W.3d at 337; Interfirst,\n\n715 S.W.2d at 641. If an order is “subject to being declared void,” it is voidable. “[T]he\n\nkey distinction between a void act and a voidable act . . . is a party’s ability—either\n\nthrough its own action or through the judicial process—to disaffirm, ratify, or confirm\n\na voidable act.” Wood v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist] 2014, pet. filed). In other words, a voidable order is “subject to\n\nbeing declared void,” upon an affirmative act by a party or court. See Cummings v. Powell,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1852) (“[A] voidable act is one which is obligatory upon others until\n\ndisaffirmed by the party with whom it originated, and which may be subsequently\n\n                                             19\n\fratified or confirmed.”). A void order, on the other hand, “is entirely null, not binding\n\non either party and not susceptible of ratification.” Id.\n\n       The Garza court rejected this argument, emphasizing the Court’s explanation in\n\nQwest that, in InterFirst, the court “declared the temporary injunction void.” Garza, 126\n\nS.W.3d at 273. But, even assuming this dicta has any meaning, the declaration in\n\nInterFirst does not answer the question of whether a non-compliant temporary\n\ninjunction is void or voidable. The declaration in InterFirst was made because a party,\n\nat that point, had challenged the order. The voidable order, when challenged (or\n\n“disaffirmed,” to use the Cummings language), was, at that moment, declared void.\n\n      Texas supreme court cases actually deciding the issue of whether an order is void\n\nor merely voidable are far more instructive than Qwest and InterFirst, which do not.\n\nThese cases emphasize that void orders are “rare.” Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline v.\n\nSchaefer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895402\"><a href=\"/opinion/895402/comm-for-lawyer-discipline-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836 (Tex. 2012); In re U.S. Silica Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894642\"><a href=\"/opinion/894642/in-re-us-silica-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438–39\n\n(Tex. 2005) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam).

The Rule 683 requirements are “purely procedural.”\n\nThose requirements do not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the parties or the\n\nsubject matter. Thus, an order that does not strictly comply with Rule 683 is “subject\n\nto being declared void,” if “disaffirmed,” but is not void when entered. As a voidable\n\norder, a defective temporary injunction is subject to all equitable principles, including\n\nestoppel and waiver.\n\n       Garza led multiple courts astray in concluding otherwise, and this Court should\n\nnot follow its sister courts down this flawed path. Of course, litigants can agree to\n\ndispense with procedural protections afforded by the Texas Rules of Procedure,\n\n                                             21\n\fincluding those in Rule 683. They do so every day—from the beginning of a suit54 to\n\nthe end.55 And Texas’ policy favors doing so. The procedural requirements governing\n\ntemporary injunctions are not special and should not be treated any differently than\n\nTexas’ other procedural requirements and protections.\n\nD.      DeLitta is estopped from now challenging the Agreed Order because he\n        agreed to its issuance and has himself sought to enforce it.\n        Because any deficiencies in the form of the temporary injunction make the\n\ninjunction simply voidable, and not void, DeLitta’s complaints are subject to general\n\nprinciples of equity and error preservation.

This motion was heard\n\n(along with a competing motion by Schaefer) on April 14, 2014—after the April 7, 2014\n\ntrial date set in the Agreed Order.57 Around the same time, DeLitta also sought to limit\n\nthe powers of the provisional member who was appointed and selected under the terms\n\nof the agreed temporary injunction.58 This Court should refuse to allow DeLitta to treat\n\nthe temporary injunction “as both right and wrong.” Having pursued the benefits of\n\ninjunctive terms when it suited him, he is now estopped from challenging the judgment\n\nhere.\n\n\n\n56\n   SuppCR21\n57\n   Compare SuppCR121 (noting date of hearing) and CR121 (Agreed Order setting trial date)\n58\n   SuppRR60–70\n\n                                              23\n\f        Finally, as previously explained,59 a party waives any challenge to a temporary\n\ninjunction by not appealing the injunction when it is first signed. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d\n\nat 834. “A motion to dissolve may not be used as a means of evading or expanding the\n\nrules applicable to appealing interlocutory orders.” Id. Thus, unless a temporary\n\ninjunction order is timely appealed, appellate courts “must presume the trial court’s\n\ninitial decision to grant the temporary injunction was proper.” Murphy v. McDaniel, 20\n\nS.W.3d at 879. DeLitta’s sole complaint on appeal concerns the validity of the original\n\ninjunction. But the injunction issued in October 2013. The 20 day window to challenge\n\nthe injunction has long since passed. DeLitta waived his right to challenge the\n\ntemporary injunction in this late appeal.\n\nIII.    The trial court was within its discretion to deny DeLitta’s motion because\n        the Agreed Order is enforceable as a Rule 11 Agreement.\n        Conspicuously missing from DeLitta’s brief is the fact that the trial court had\n\npreviously enforced the Agreed Order as a valid and binding Rule 11 agreement. On\n\nJune 19, 2014, the trial court signed an order enforcing the Agreed Order.60 The order\n\nexpressly found it was being enforced, not just as a temporary injunction, but also as a\n\nRule 11 agreement.61 The court’s order emphasized that “all parties [shall] strictly abide\n\nby the terms of the” Agreed Order.62\n\n\n59\n   See infra, Sec. I\n60\n   SuppCR193\n61\n   SuppCR192 (finding that the Agreed Order “is an agreed order approved as to ‘form and content’\nby all parties, signed by the court and filed in the clerk’s office” and “is enforceable as a court order\nand as a Rule 11 agreement between the parties”)\n62\n   Id. (emphasis in original)\n\n                                                   24\n\f        The trial court was correct to do so. The parties’ agreement meets all the\n\nrequirements of Rule 11 and is thus a valid agreement, even if it does not meet the\n\nrequirements of a valid temporary injunction under Rule 683. As such, the trial court\n\nhad a ministerial duty to enforce the Agreed Order as a Rule 11 agreement. See Fortis\n\nBenefits v.

But the trial court knew that\nthe Agreed Order had been enforced previously as a Rule 11 agreement. CR372-76 (arguing the trial\ncourt had a ministerial duty to enforce the Agreed Order as a Rule 11). Under the central docket\nsystem, trial judges are reluctant to overrule prior rulings of their colleagues. See TRAVIS CO. DIST.\nCT. L.R. 1.4 (“A request to be heard on a motion for new trial or any other motion challenging a prior\nruling, except one by default, must be presented to the judge who made the ruling, including a visiting\njudge.”),       available      at      https://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/courts/docs/local_rules\n_civildistrict.pdf (last visited April 29, 2015). Thus, the trial court was within its discretion to deny\nDeLitta’s motion on this purely procedural ground. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835 (trial court has no duty\nto reconsider the propriety of the granting of a temporary injunction).\n\n                                                  25\n\f(Tex. 1995). Padilla was a personal injury case. Id. at 455. Through a series of\n\ncommunications, the parties appeared to reach a settlement agreement. Id. at 455–56.\n\nWhen the plaintiff refused to accept payment, the defendant filed a counterclaim in the\n\npending action seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement. Id. at 457. Both sides\n\nmoved for summary judgment on the counterclaim. Id. The trial court found that the\n\nseries of emails did not constitute an enforceable agreement under Rule 11 and granted\n\nsummary judgment for the plaintiff.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court reversed. It first found that, contrary to the trial\n\ncourt’s ruling, the parties did have an enforceable agreement under Rule 11. Id. at 461.\n\nIt then addressed the plaintiffs’ argument that the settlement agreement, if one was\n\nreached, was unenforceable because the plaintiffs withdrew consent before judgment\n\nwas rendered. Absent consent, the plaintiffs argued, a trial court has no authority to\n\nrender an agreed judgment. Id.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court disagreed. The agreement, the Court said, was\n\nenforceable in contract even if it would not meet the requirements of an agreed\n\njudgment. Id. It explained:\n\n      The LaFrances . . . confuse the requirements for an agreed judgment with\n      those for an enforceable settlement agreement. Although a court cannot\n      render a valid agreed judgment absent consent at the time it is rendered,\n      this does not preclude the court, after proper notice and hearing, from\n      enforcing a settlement agreement complying with Rule 11 even though\n      one side no longer consents to the settlement. The judgment in the latter\n      case is not an agreed judgment, but rather is a judgment enforcing a\n      binding contract.\n\n\n                                          26\n\fId.\n\n      Like the plaintiffs in Padilla, DeLitta “confuse[s] the requirements” for a\n\ntemporary injunction for those of an enforceable Rule 11 agreement. See id. at 461.\n\nDeLitta assumes that if he attacks one the other falls. But Padilla holds otherwise.\n\nPadilla instructs that one can fail as a judgment (there, for lack of consent) and still be\n\nenforceable in contract. Under the same reasoning, if the Agreed Order meets the\n\nrequirements of Rule 11, it is enforceable as a Rule 11 agreement, even if it would\n\notherwise fail as a temporary injunction.\n\nB.    The Agreed Order meets all the elements of an enforceable Rule 11.\n      The October 2013 Agreed Order meets all the requirements of Rule 11 and is\n\nthus enforceable as a Rule 11 agreement. Rule 11 provides:\n\n      Unless otherwise provided in these rules, no agreement between attorneys\n      or parties touching any suit pending will be enforced unless it be in writing,\n      signed and filed with the papers as part of the record, or unless it be made\n      in open court and entered of record.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 11.\n\n      A trial court must enforce any agreement that meets the elements of Rule 11.\n\nFortis Benefits, 234 S.W.3d at 651 (“As this is a valid pretrial agreement under Rule 11,\n\nthe trial court had a duty to enforce its terms.”). Those elements are quite simple:\n\n            The agreement must be between attorneys or parties and touching\n             on a pending lawsuit;\n            The agreement must be in writing;\n            The agreement must be signed; and\n            The agreement must be made a part of the record.\n\n\n                                            27\n\f       The October 2013 order meets these requirements. Nancy Schaefer filed suit on\n\nOctober 9, 2013,64 and the parties agreed to the injunctive provisions on October 29,\n\n2013,65 while the suit was still pending.66 The agreement touched on the lawsuit in that\n\nthe 9 pages of agreed terms were intended to govern the parties’ conduct as it relates to\n\nAxiom (the company which is the subject matter of the lawsuit) during the litigation.67\n\nThe agreement was in writing.68 It was signed—“agreed as to form and content”—by\n\nall the party attorneys: Howard Carter and Mark Stromberg, attorneys for plaintiff, as\n\nwell as Teresa De Ford, attorney for the Axiom defendants, and Joe Griffin, attorney\n\nfor Michael J. DeLitta and DeLCom Properties, LLC.69 It was filed in the court’s record\n\non the same day as it was signed by the parties.70\n\n       The October 2013 order meets all the requirements of Rule 11. Accordingly, it\n\nis an enforceable agreement. The Axiom defendants “entered into and [are] bound by\n\nthe specific language in the Rule 11 agreement.” Fortis Benefits, 234 S.W.3d at 651. The\n\nCourt can affirm the trial court’s refusal to dissolve the Agreed Order on this ground.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n       For these reasons, Appellee asks that the Court to affirm the trial court’s order.\n\nAppellee seeks any other relief to which she may be entitled.\n\n64\n   CR3\n65\n   CR121\n66\n   CR2 (docket sheet)\n67\n   See CR115–23\n68\n   Id.\n69\n   CR121\n70\n   Compare CR115 (filestamp) with CR121 (date of signature)\n\n                                                28\n\fDated: May 6, 2015                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        /s/Lisa Bowlin Hobbs\n\n Donald R.

Judgment\nbecame final November 26, 1969 when Brazzel's application for writ of error was overruled by this Court.\n\nThe Clerk of the Waco Court issued the mandate to the trial court on December 4, 1969, although Brazzel had failed to pay the\ncosts at that time as ordered by the judgment of the Waco Court and as required by Rule 443, T.R.C.P., which provides:\n          'On the rendition of a final judgment or decree in the Court of Civil Appeals, the clerk of said court shall\n          not issue and deliver the mandate of the court nor certify the proceedings to the lower court until all costs\n          accruing in the case in such appellate court have been paid, subject to the provisions of Rule 444.'\n\n\n\nRule 444, T.R.C.P., provides for the filing of affidavits of inability to pay the costs as required in Rule 443, T.R.C.P.\n\nMurray subsequently filed a motion in the Waco Court to recall the mandate because of the non-payment of the costs.

(Henna), a tenant, appellee El Chico Restaurants of Texas, L.P. (El Chico), and the tenant's guarantor, El Chico\nRestaurants, Inc., over the proper construction of their commercial ground lease. The principal issue concerns whether air-\nconditioning units that El Chico installed on a building that the lease required it to construct are “improvements” that the lease\nobligated El Chico to maintain and deliver to Henna in good condition upon the lease's expiration, as Henna contends, or are\ntrade fixtures that are excluded from the lease's definition of “improvements,” as appellees argue. We agree with appellees that\nthe air-conditioning units are trade fixtures and not “improvements” as a matter of law. Because this is one of the grounds on\nwhich the district court could have relied in granting summary judgment for appellees, we will affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                        BACKGROUND\n\nThe material underlying facts are undisputed. On September 24, 1996, El Chico and Henna's predecessor, Boardwalk Center,\nLtd., entered into a ground lease of a parcel of land located in Round Rock that Boardwalk owned and was developing as\npart of a new retail shopping center. On the same day, El Chico Restaurants, Inc. signed an agreement to guarantee El Chico's\nobligations under the ground lease.\n\nAmong its other obligations under the ground lease, El Chico was required to construct a building on the parcel it was leasing\n(defined as the “Land”) within the permissible building area reflected in the project's site plan and “pursuant to plans and\nspecifications approved in writing by Landlord [Boardwalk].” The lease defined this “building and other improvements and\nappurtenances that may hereafter be erected” on the Land as the “Improvements” and defined the Land and Improvements\ncollectively as the “Premises.” The referenced “plans and specifications” included or depicted two 12.5–ton 1 air conditioning\nunits and two 10–ton units (the “HVAC units”), which were to be installed on top of the building.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

El Chico Restaurants of..., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2007401\"><a href=\"/opinion/2007401/cw-100-louis-henna-v-el-chico-rests/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009)\n\n\n\n\nThe lease authorized El Chico to use the Premises to operate a “restaurant, a related cocktail lounge, such other uses as are\nincidental to the operation thereof and for any other lawful purpose,” subject to its complying with “all applicable governmental\nand regulatory requirements and regulations.” The lease was to run for an initial term expiring on the tenth anniversary of the\n“Rent Commencement Date”—a date tied to when El Chico opened for business on the Premises—subject to El *751 Chico's\nright to renew the lease for up to four additional terms of five years each. While the lease was in effect, El Chico would own the\nImprovements “hereafter constructed or placed on the Land during the Term,” but El Chico had “no right to demolish, remove or\nalter the Improvements without Landlord's prior written consent.” El Chico was further required to carry specified insurance on\nthe Premises and “take good care of the Improvements during the Term, including repairs to the interior, exterior and structure,\nit being understood that Landlord shall not be required to maintain the Premises or make any repairs to the Improvements during\nthe Term.” At the end of the lease, El Chico was required to “deliver up the Land with the Improvements then situated thereon in\ngood repair and condition, loss by fire or other casualty, condemnation, act of God, ordinary wear and tear, decay, depreciation\nand obsolescence being excepted,” whereupon the Improvements were to “be and become the property of Landlord ... without\ncompensation therefor.” However, paragraph 12 of the lease provided that “trade and business fixtures ... shall not be deemed\nto be part of the Premises but shall remain the property of Tenant.”\n\nThe “Rent Commencement Date” was in April 1997, which meant that the ten-year initial lease term ran until April 2007. The\nrecord reflects that, in April 2006, Boardwalk conveyed its interest in the Premises and the ground lease to Henna Blvd., L.L.C.,\nwhich then assigned these interests to Henna. Around the same time, El Chico gave written notice to Henna Blvd., L.L.C. that El\nChico had ceased doing business in the Premises and that it would permit the lease to expire at the end of the initial term without\nrenewing it. In this document, El Chico also waived any rights it possessed under the lease that would have prevented Henna\nBlvd., L.L.C. (or Henna, its successor) from marketing and selling or leasing the Premises, and El Chico agreed to execute a\ndocument terminating the lease upon the landlord's request if the landlord succeeded in selling or leasing the Premises.\n\nIn June 2006, El Chico sold Henna “all furniture, fixtures and equipment (collectively, the ‘Assets') located, as of this date, in the\nEl Chico® restaurant at 100 Louis Henna Boulevard, Round Rock.” Henna acknowledged and agreed that it “ha[d] inspected\nthe Assets at the Premises and [was] acquiring the Assets in their ‘AS IS' condition.” Around the same time, El Chico and Henna\namended the ground lease to provide that effective June 23, 2006, Henna would assume responsibility for paying all charges for\nutility services at the Premises, including the security alarm system, and for maintaining the grounds around the Improvements.\nHowever, El Chico continued to make monthly rental payments through the end of the initial lease term in April 2007.\n\nIn January 2007, a few months before the lease's April expiration, Henna learned that the HVAC units on top of the restaurant\nbuilding had been vandalized by copper thieves and damaged by hail. Henna obtained an estimate of $38,496 to repair the\ndamage. A series of communications ensued between the parties or their agents in which it was disputed whether Henna or\nEl Chico was responsible for repairing and/or insuring against the damage to the HVAC units. Eventually, in August and\nSeptember of that year, counsel for Henna sent letters to both El Chico and, as guarantor, El Chico Restaurants, Inc., demanding\npayment of the $38,496 estimated repair amount. In October, Henna sued these entities.\n\nHenna alleged that appellees were obligated under the ground lease to insure or *752 repair the HVAC units and had failed to\nperform. It asserted a cause of action for breach of contract and sought damages and attorney's fees. Henna filed a “traditional”\nmotion for partial summary judgment as to appellees' liability for breaching the lease. It attempted to conclusively establish each\nof the elements of its breach-of-contract cause of action; namely, that: (1) a valid contract existed between the parties; (2) Henna\nhad performed or tendered performance; (3) appellees had breached the contract; and (4) Henna was damaged as a result of the\nbreach.

Any\n        such installations shall be in accordance with applicable local codes and Tenant's pylon signage and monument signage,\n        if applicable, shall be installed in those locations designated therefor as reflected in the Site Plan.

Any property remaining in the Improvements after such thirty (30) day period shall be deemed to have\n        been abandoned by Tenant.\n\n(Italics added.) Because the “Premises” from which “trade or business fixtures” are excluded are defined elsewhere in the lease\nto mean the “Land” plus the “Improvements,” paragraph 12 means that anything constituting a “trade or business fixture” (or,\nfor that matter, anything constituting “such equipment, ... signs ... and other personal property as Tenant may deem necessary\nor appropriate” to install or operate on the Premises) cannot be an Improvement.\n\n [9] [10] The ground lease does not contain a definition of trade or business fixtures.

Similarly, paragraph 12 excluded “trade or business\nfixtures” from the lease's definition of “Improvements,” just as trade fixtures are excluded from improvements under Texas law.\n\nAppellees conclusively established that the HVAC units at issue met the commonly understood definition of trade fixtures.\nThey presented uncontroverted summary-judgment evidence that the HVAC units were not attached to the building, but were\ndesigned to be and were placed on curbs on the roof so they could be removed and replaced without injury to the building, and\nthat such units needed to be replaced periodically as they reached the end of their useful life cycles. Appellees likewise presented\nundisputed evidence that the HVAC units here were approaching the end of their useful lives, and that the units ultimately were\nreplaced without injury to the building. Further, appellees presented uncontroverted summary-judgment evidence *756 that\nthe 45 tons of air-conditioning capacity provided by the HVAC units facilitated the building's use as a restaurant, but was many\ntimes greater than that needed if the building were to be used for other retail or office use. Several Texas courts, addressing\nsimilar facts, have held that air-conditioning units are trade fixtures as a matter of law.

Thus, Henna reasons, the\n“Improvements [that] shall be constructed ... pursuant to plans and specifications” under paragraph 5 included the HVAC units\nthat El Chico later installed.\n\nBased on this premise, Henna argues that paragraph 5 evinces the drafters' agreement and intent to impose an obligation on El\nChico to include the HVAC units at issue when constructing the building. Henna also relies on paragraphs 6 and 30 of the ground\nlease for a similar proposition. Paragraph 6 authorized El Chico to use the Premises “for the operation of a restaurant ... and\nfor any other lawful purpose, subject, however, to ... all applicable governmental and regulatory requirements and restrictions.”\nSimilarly, *757 paragraph 30 provided that, during the lease term, “Tenant ... shall conform to and comply with all ordinances,\nregulations and laws (federal, state, or municipal) ... affecting the Premises....” Henna presented summary-judgment evidence\nthat El Chico had obtained a certificate of occupancy for its restaurant from the City of Round Rock based on the plans and\nspecifications. From this, Henna reasons that El Chico had obligations under paragraphs 6 and 30 to install the HVAC units\nin order to comply with this “regulatory requirement.”\n\nThe existence of these agreements and obligations on the part of El Chico to install the HVAC units when constructing\nits restaurant building, Henna further reasons, distinguishes the HVAC units from a trade fixture, which, Henna asserts, is\ncharacterized by a tenant's unilateral decision to affix personalty to an existing building that the tenant has leased. Relatedly,\nHenna argues that the HVAC units were part of the consideration the landlord bargained to obtain under the ground lease. In sum,\nHenna urges that “[t]he decision to originally incorporate the HVAC system was neither unilateral nor voluntary; rather, such\ndecision was bilateral, between El Chico and its landlord, as well as required under the plans and specifications incorporated into\nthe ground lease, itself, of course, the product of arms-length negotiation between the parties, a factual distinction absolutely\ndeterminative in the present appeal.”\n\nThe chief flaw in Henna's reasoning is its foundational premise that the ground lease's definition of “Improvements”\nencompassed the HVAC units because the plans and specifications called for two 12–ton units and two 10–ton units like El Chico\ninstalled. Contrary to Henna's argument, paragraph 5 does not purport to incorporate into the lease's “Improvements” definition\nwhatever property might have been depicted in the plans and specifications. Paragraph 5 requires that “[t]he Improvements\nshall be constructed ... pursuant to [the] plans and specifications,” which means that the Improvements must be constructed\nin a manner carrying out or in conformity with the plans and specifications. 2 It does not follow from this requirement that\nany piece of property depicted in the plans and specifications, even if otherwise considered a trade fixture, equipment, or other\npersonal property, would be an Improvement. For example, appellees presented summary-judgment evidence that the plans\nand specifications also included depictions of El Chico's walk-in coolers, freezers, tables and chairs, and other trade fixtures\nor restaurant equipment. If, as Henna argues, paragraph 5 means that all property depicted in the plans and specifications is\nan “Improvement” that El Chico could not remove without the landlord's approval, it would conflict with paragraph 12, which\ngrants El Chico the right to “remove all or any part of Tenant's equipment, removable fixtures, signs ... and other personal\nproperty from the Premises, provided that Tenant repairs all damage to the Improvements caused by such removal.” We must\ninstead construe these provisions in relation to one another so as to give both effect. See Valence Operating Co., 164 S.W.3d\nat 662. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the drafters intended paragraph 5 to mean that all property depicted in the plans\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

El Chico Restaurants of..., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2007401\"><a href=\"/opinion/2007401/cw-100-louis-henna-v-el-chico-rests/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009)\n\n\nand specifications is “Improvements” that El Chico could not remove and that the landlord would own after the lease expired.\nIn short, paragraph 5 does *758 not mean that the HVAC units are “Improvements” under the ground lease.\n\nWe are similarly unpersuaded by Henna's argument that the HVAC units cannot be trade fixtures because the drafters anticipated\nat the inception of the ground lease that El Chico would install such units when constructing the restaurant building. Henna\nis correct that the reported Texas cases holding that air-conditioning units are trade fixtures have involved units that a tenant\ninstalled in a preexisting building during a lease term—not, as here, a ground lease where the parties contemplated that the tenant\nwould construct a building and install the units. See Boyett, 746 S.W.2d at 27–28; White, 299 S.W.2d at 190–92; Moskowitz, 178\nS.W.2d at 879–80. Although Henna is correct as a factual matter, we disagree that the legal principle governing these decisions\nturns solely on whether or when the tenant and/or landlord anticipated that the units would be installed. The critical issue, rather,\nis whether the parties intended the air-conditioning units to be permanent additions to the building, for the landlord's ownership\nand benefit as part of the realty, or temporary additions to aid the tenant, El Chico, while it was operating a restaurant in the\nbuilding. See Jim Walter Window Components, 642 S.W.2d at 5 (quoting Menger, 28 S.W. at 823). We ascertain such intent, as\nHenna has acknowledged, from the terms of the ground lease. Id. at 4 (“The intent of the parties regarding the right to remove\nadditions at the termination of a lease is to be determined from the provisions of the lease agreement.”); see Tempo Tamers,\nInc., 715 S.W.2d at 664.\n\nThe drafters' use of “trade or business fixtures” in paragraph 12 of the ground lease, as discussed, manifests their intent to\nincorporate the commonly understood meaning of trade fixtures under Texas law. Paragraph 5 of the lease does not reflect\na contrary intent, nor do paragraphs 6 and 30, the other provisions on which Henna relies. As appellees observe, Henna's\narguments concerning the restaurant's certificate of occupancy are simply inapposite. The fact that El Chico submitted the plans\nand specifications to the City of Round Rock when obtaining a certificate of occupancy permitting it to operate a restaurant\nin the building has no bearing on whether the drafters intended the HVAC units or other property depicted in the plans and\nspecifications to be “Improvements” or trade fixtures.\n\nAppellees conclusively established that the HVAC units are trade fixtures under the established definition of that term in Texas\nlaw. Paragraph 12 explicitly excludes “trade or business fixtures” from the “Premises” and, thus, the “Improvements” under\nthe lease. In other words, the ground lease unambiguously manifests the drafters' intent that the HVAC units El Chico was\nto install on the building would be temporary additions to the realty to aid El Chico in operating a restaurant there, which El\nChico would continue to own at the lease's conclusion, and not “Improvements” that it was required to maintain or repair for\nthe landlord's benefit. We are bound to give effect to this unambiguous language as the controlling indicator of the bargain the\ndrafters intended to strike. See Willis, 199 S.W.3d at 275; J.M. Davidson, Inc., 128 S.W.3d at 229.\n\nIn a final argument, Henna asserts that El Chico “didn't consider the HVAC system a fixture” in its June 2006 sale of “all\nfurniture, fixtures and equipment” to Henna because the HVAC units did not appear in the list of property attached to the\nbill of sale. Henna suggests this evidence raises an inference that, as late as June 2006, El Chico intended or understood that\nthe HVAC units were not trade fixtures. We disagree. First, even assuming that *759 “fixtures” as used in the bill of sale\nwould have included trade fixtures, the record does not support Henna's factual premise that El Chico excluded the HVAC units\nfrom that category of property—the bill of sale explicitly covers “all furniture, fixtures and equipment, whether or not listed\nin Exhibit ‘A.’ ” Second, and more importantly, even if this evidence supported an inference as to El Chico's subjective intent\nor understanding regarding whether the HVAC units were trade fixtures, it would be incompetent to raise a fact issue as to the\nparties' intent in the face of the unambiguous ground lease.

Because the HVAC units were not “Improvements” as a matter of law, the district court properly granted\nsummary judgment for appellees on the ground that Henna cannot prove breach. Accordingly, we overrule Henna's fifth point\nof error and its corresponding first point of error.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These respective amounts, to-wit, $7,000.00, $450.00 and $250.00 were charged against\nplaintiff's interest in the community property. The balance of the property involved was held to be community property and\na commissioner was appointed to sell same under the direction of the court and divide the proceeds in accordance with the\njudgment under the direction of the court. Defendant perfected an appeal from parts of this judgment. He appealed from that\npart of the judgment declaring the three pieces of property hereinbefore described as *471 the separate property of his wife,\nfrom that portion of the judgment allowing his wife the recovery of an attorney's fee of $6500.00 and charging the same against\nhis interest in the community property.\n\n‘Appellee has filed a supplemental transcript herein which in substance shows that the commissioner under the direction and\nauthority of the court has sold all community property in accordance with the judgment, has disposed of all the money arising\ntherefrom except the sum of $2666.79 which under the order of the court he paid into the registry of the court, and was\ndischarged. Some of these distributions were requested by the defendant. The attorney's fees in the sum of $6500.00 have been\npaid and same were charged against the interest of defendant in the community. The charges made in favor of the community\nestate for indebtedness paid on obligations against property adjudged to plaintiff as her separate property have been paid to\ndefendant, that is, one-half thereof has been charged as against plaintiff's interest in the community estate and paid to the\ndefendant in the sum of $7700.00.\n\n‘In our original disposition of the case we held that the accepting by defendant of the offsets adjudged in his favor as to the\nproperty located at 5401 South Flores Street and at 344 Park Drive, each of which piece of property was adjudged to be separate\nproperty of plaintiff, estopped him from complaining of the trial judge's judgment decreeing same to be the separate property of\nplaintiff. To this view in ruling on the motion for a rehearing we still adhere. Further, in regard to the property at 605 Guadalupe\nStreet as to which appellee (plaintiff) has filed a motion for rehearing, we still adhere to the view expressed in the original\nopinion that defendant is not estopped from claiming that same is community property. In regard to the fee for $6500.00 allowed\nto plaintiff we granted defendant's motion for rehearing and rendered judgment charging said fee to the community estate of\nplaintiff and defendant. For further facts we refer to our original opinion and our opinion on our holding granting the motion\nfor rehearing, and likewise as to our reasons for the disposition made of the respective matters in controversy.’\n\n\nThe first and second questions certified are:\n‘Question No. 1. Did we err in holding that defendant was not entitled to complain on appeal of that portion of the **1004\njudgment decreeing the property at 344 Park Drive as the separate property of plaintiff and that portion of the judgment decreeing\n *472 the property at 5401 South Flores Street as the separate property of plaintiff on account of the fact that he accepted\nand collected from plaintiff's interest in the community estate one-half of the community money used in paying obligations\nagainst said property?’\n\n‘Question No. 2. Did we err in holding that defendant by his action subsequent to the rendition of the judgment had not estopped\nhimself from complaining of the court's action in decreeing the property at 605 Guadalupe Street as the separate property of\nplaintiff?’\n\n [1] [2] A litigant cannot treat a judgment as both right and wrong, and if he has voluntarily accepted the benefits of a judgment,\nhe cannot afterward prosecute an appeal therefrom. That is the general rule which appears to be universally recognized. It was\nannounced by this court in the early case of Matlow v. Cox, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The rule is based on the principle of estoppel. It,\nhowever, is subject to the exception that ‘* * * where the reversal of a judgment cannot possibly affect an appellant's right to\nthe benefit secured under a judgment, then an appeal may be taken, * * *.’ 2 Am.Jur., Appeal and Error, Sec. 215. Numerous\nauthorities, approaching the exception from a slightly different angle, define it, in effect, in this language: Where an appellant\naccepts only that which appellee concedes, or is bound to concede, to be due him under the judgment he is not estopped to\nprosecute an appeal which involves only his right to a further recovery.

Whether or not this case falls within it must be determined from answers to these questions:\nCould a reversal of the portions of the judgment referred to in these two certified questions possibly affect appellant's right to\nthe benefits secured by him under the judgment? And would appellee be compelled to concede upon another trial that appellant\nhas the right to retain those benefits regardless of the outcome of the litigation?\n\n\nAs we understand the facts stated in the certificate and in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1507040\"><a href=\"/opinion/1507040/carle-v-carle/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, appellee\ninstituted this suit in which she claimed that the property mentioned in these questions belonged to her in her separate right. The\nappellant claimed that it belonged to *473 the community estate. His claim was denied and he seeks to have that portion of\nthe judgment revised. As the matter now stands, appellant has been awarded and has voluntarily accepted $7,700.00 in cash on\nthe basis of a holding by the trial court that the property belongs to appellee as her separate estate, a part of which was charged\nwith an indebtedness of $15,400.00 in favor of the community. Should the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded to the\ntrial court it would become its mandatory duty to divide the estate of the parties. Article 4638, R.S.1925. If upon another trial it\nshould be adjudged that the property is community property, the court, for instance, might deem it just and right to award one\nof these lots to one party and the other two lots to the other party. Clearly, the court would have the authority to to so under the\narticle of the statutes above mentioned by making provisions for adjudicating equities. In order to restore the status quo so the\ncourt could partition it in the manner indicated it would be necessary for appellant to restore the amount ($7,700.00) received\nby him under the original judgment. The amount of the community funds remaining undistributed is much less than that sum. It\nappears, then, that if appellant should be successful in his appeal and then successful upon another trial in establishing his claim\nthat the property is community, the benefit secured by him under the judgment appealed from would necessarily be affected.\nBesides, the right of appellee to a partition of the property might well be prejudiced. She certainly would **1005 not concede\nthat appellant would be entitled to retain the money paid him on the ground that the property is not community while pressing\nhis claim that it is community. We accordingly answer the first question, ‘No,’ and the second question, ‘Yes.’\n\nQuestions 3 and 4 are as follows:\n‘Question No. 3. Did we err in holding on rehearing that defendant by his action subsequent to the rendition of the judgment had\nnot estopped himself from complaining of the court's action in charging the attorney's fees against his half of the community\nestate?’\n\n‘Question No. 4. Did we err in holding on rehearing that the attorney's fee charged by the trial court solely against the defendant's\ninterest in the community estate was as a matter of law chargeable against the community estate as a whole?’\n\n [4] [5] [6] We first consider question No. 4. The decisions of various courts of civil appeals with respect to this question\ncannot well be harmonized. *474 As we view the problem, it is not a correct approach to its solution to classify the wife's\nattorney's fees as a necessity, and then apply the rule that necessities are primarily the obligations of the community and\nsecondarily of the husband's separate estate. That reasoning fails to take into account Article 4638, supra, which provides: ‘The\ncourt pronouncing a decree of divorce shall also decree and order a division of the estate of the parties in such a way as the\ncourt shall deem just and right, having due regard to the rights of each party and their children, if any. Nothing herein shall be\nconstrued to compel either party to divest himself or herself of the title to real estate.’\n\n\nThat statute clearly vests discretion in the trial court in determining the proper division of the community estate of the parties.\nThe court is not required, as a matter of law, to divide that estate equally between them. In practical effect, a decree that the\nhusband pay all of the wife's attorney's fees may be to award him less of the community estate than that awarded to the wife,\nbut that alone does not condemn it. The attorney's fee is but a factor to be considered by the court in making an equitable\ndivision of the estate, considering the conditions and needs of the parties and all of the surrounding circumstances. We answer\nquestion No. 4, ‘Yes.’\n\nIn view of our answer to question No. 4, question No. 3 becomes immaterial.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Chambers contends\nthat Rosenberg's actions violated an agreed temporary injunction and an agreed final judgment and permanent injunction. The\ntrial court held that the temporary injunction was void ab initio because no bond was executed. The court found that the final\njudgment was vague, ambiguous, overly broad, and unenforceable, but did not find it void; the court simply denied the motion\nfor contempt. We will affirm the order of the trial court.\n\n [1] We cannot review the denial of the motion for contempt of the agreed final judgment and permanent injunction. The denial\nof a motion for contempt is not appealable because it is not a final order. Norman v.

Though courts generally apply this rule only for jurisdictional\ndefects, the supreme court's insistence that temporary injunctions issued without bonds are void convinces us that the trial\ncourt correctly disregarded the temporary injunction here. The trial court did not set aside the final judgment and permanent\ninjunction. We overrule point one.\n\nWe do not reach point five, which concerned the scope of the temporary injunction. We need not consider the scope of a void\norder.\n\nWe affirm the order of the trial court.\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                   © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Baughman, Baytown, for appellant.\n\nRon Hayes, John R. Coe, Houston, for appellee.\n\nBefore OSBORN, C.J., and WOODARD and KOEHLER, JJ.\n\n\n\n                                                           OPINION\n\nKOEHLER, Justice.\n\nThis is an appeal from a judgment awarding $3,500.00 in child support arrearages following a non-jury hearing. We affirm.\n\nAppellant brings three points of error, complaining (1) that the original divorce decree being too ambiguous to be enforced\nby contempt is also too ambiguous to support a judgment for arrearages, (2) that the provision in the decree for an automatic\nincrease in child support in the second year is unenforceable, and (3) that the judgment for arrearages, being an enforcement\norder, does not meet the requirements of Section 14.33 of the Family Code and is therefore unenforceable.\n\nThe parties were divorced on January 19, 1982. Appellee was named managing conservator of the only child of the marriage.\nIn the decree, the court found that the parties had entered into a written agreement containing provisions for conservatorship\nand child support, which were found to be “in the best interest of the child.” Appellant, as possessory conservator, was ordered\nto make child support payments of $300.00 per month beginning on February 1, 1982. The decree then provided that:\n\n            Beginning with the first payment due in the second year of such support payments, said support shall\n            automatically, without further action from the Court, increase to the sum of THREE HUNDRED FIFTY\n            AND NO/100 ($350.00) DOLLARS per month,....\n\nOriginally brought as a contempt motion, Appellee pled, and the evidence supported a finding, that Appellant had failed to make\nthe additional $50.00 monthly payment *551 commencing with the payment due on February 1, 1983 and extending for each\nmonth through December 1988. At a pretrial hearing, upon a suggestion by the court that the order pertaining to the automatic\nincrease was too ambiguous to be enforceable by contempt, Appellee amended her pleadings by requesting a judgment for\nthe arrearages, in addition to enforcement by contempt. However, at the commencement of the hearing, Appellee waived the\ncontempt action, requesting relief only by way of a money judgment for the arrearage.\n\n [1] Although it is not necessary for a resolution of this appeal, we do not conclude that the quoted portion of the decree was\nambiguous. While it undoubtedly could have been made clearer, it would be difficult to construe “beginning with the first\npayment due in the second year of such support payments” to mean any date other than February 1, 1983. Had the first payment\nunder the decree been due on December 1, 1982 instead of February 1, 1982, it would have made no sense to argue that the first\npayment in the second year could have meant January 1, 1983 or some date other than December 1, 1983. But assuming that\nthere was some ambiguity, the worst that could have been contended was that the increased payments were to begin with the\npayment due on January 1, 1983. Appellee sought a judgment for the arrearages commencing with the payment due February 1,\n1983 and waived enforcement by contempt. The fact there may have been some ambiguity as to whether the increased payment\nshould start on January 1 or February 1, 1983 would not make the order void for vagueness for payments due from February 1,\n1983 forward. Furthermore, since the provisions in the decree relating to conservatorship and child support were based on the\nwritten agreement of the parties, the ambiguity in this case would be susceptible to interpretation by the trial court after hearing\nthe evidence as in the case of an agreed judgment.

While a court may not arbitrarily impose automatic or\nformula increases in child support, if the parties agree on an automatic increase in child support upon the happening of a certain\nevent and the court has found that the *552 agreement is in the best interest of the child, the parties may be ordered to perform\nin accordance with that agreement and upon their failure to do so, the child support order as set forth in the decree may be\nenforced by all available remedies, including contempt. Doss, 521 S.W.2d at 713. Tex.Fam.Code Ann. sec. 14.06 (Vernon\n1986). In the instant case, the parties had agreed in writing to provisions for child support and the court had found the agreement\nto be in the child's best interest. Appellant does not now claim, nor did he present any evidence in the trial court, that the child\nsupport order did not reflect the agreement of the parties. Point of Error No. Two is overruled.\n\n [3] In Appellant's final point of error, he challenges the judgment for past due child support as not meeting the requirements\nof Tex.Fam.Code Ann. sec. 14.33(a) (Vernon Supp.1990). That section in part states:\n\n             (a) Contents. An enforcement order shall contain findings setting out in ordinary and concise language the\n             provisions of the final order, decree, or judgment for which enforcement was sought, the acts or omissions\n             that are the subject of the order, the manner of noncompliance, and the relief awarded by the Court.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the court on the record made its order, which we conclude was in sufficient detail to comply\nwith Section 14.33(a). The trial judge said:\n\n  The Court finds that a judgment in the amount of $3,500 is hereby had against Mr. Thomas Cisneros, III in favor of Mrs.\n  Elva Cisneros for the ordered payments of $50 per month commencing February 1st of '83 through February 15th of '89; and\n  in accordance with the divorce decree ... through the Harris County Probation Department, Child Support Division at 1115\n  Congress in Houston, Texas. Judgment is here now had in the amount of $3,500 for which let execution issue. Each party\n  will pay their own costs of Court and attorney fees incurred in this cause.\n\nThe attorney for Appellant was in effect ordered to prepare the judgment, presumably in accordance with the court's oral order.\nHad she done so, the judgment in our opinion would have sufficiently met the requirements of Section 14.33(a). All of the cases\ncited by Appellant in support of his third point involved contempt and commitment situations, which admittedly and obviously\nrequire more specificity as to acts or omissions leading to the contempt than would a judgment for unpaid support. Under\nTex.R.App.P. 81 (formerly Tex.R.Civ.P. 434), the normal course on this point would be to reform the judgment to conform to\nthe judge's oral order and then affirm the judgment as reformed.\n\nHowever, such action is not indicated since the judgment may be affirmed for another reason. After its preparation, the judgment\nwas then approved not only as to form (a usual and harmless procedure), but as to substance as well by the attorneys representing\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Essentially, the\nClaxtons agree that the 2002 judgment is final, and now ask us to dismiss their appeal for want of jurisdiction.\n\nThe District takes the position that we should disregard the notation on the judgment as to the date it was signed, because it\nwas actually signed on the date it was ultimately filed. The extensive record provided contains nothing to support that position,\nother than the District's pleadings. The trial court's order granting the District's motion for new trial states that the prior agreed\njudgment “entered on September 6, 2002 (but bearing the erroneous date of July 12, 2002) should be, and it is hereby in all\nthings, vacated and set aside.”\n\n [4] Even if the trial court had the jurisdiction to grant the motion for new trial—which on its face it did not—and assuming\nthat some error exists in the face of a judgment signed as correct in form and substance by all counsel, and even if this were a\ndocument properly rendering a new judgment, it does not state the correct date on which the judgment was signed, and could\nnot be used by this Court to establish a signing date different from that on the face of the judgment. 1\n\nThe question of our jurisdiction to hear an appeal of this case then depends on the determination of which of the two signed\njudgments is the valid one.

Because we reach just that result in this opinion,\nwe reinstate the appeal.\n\nIn its motion for rehearing, the District urges us to find valid the changes made by the nunc pro tunc judgment and thus recognize\nthe later trial court judgment favoring the District. In their response, the Claxtons argue that, for a few reasons, we should\ndisregard the nunc pro tunc judgment and recognize the 2002 judgment as the final judgment of the trial court. We disagree\nbecause (1) the 2002 judgment's originally recited date of signing was a clerical error, (2) the originally recited signing date is\nnot binding as part of any agreement of the parties, and (3) the date change is supported by the record.\n\n\n(1) The 2002 Judgment's Originally Recited Judgment Date Was a Clerical Error\n [9] The Claxtons assert that the nunc pro tunc date change was substantive or judicial in nature, and was thus not authorized.\nWe conclude otherwise.\n\n [10] Clerical mistakes in a judgment may be corrected by the judge in open court, and judgment nunc pro tunc rendered by\nthe trial court, according to the truth or justice of the case.

When such a mistake is made and memorialized accurately by the trial court, any change is\njudicial in nature. It may be a mistake, but it is not the result of a clerical error: thus, a nunc pro tunc judgment is not available.\n\nA different situation is presented where a written judgment is ultimately signed that differs from the terms of the judgment\nas pronounced by the court. 4 In that situation, a nunc pro tunc judgment is available, because the written judgment does not\ncomport with the prior rendering.\n\n [13] [14] This case presents a third nunc pro tunc situation.

Approval as to form is a matter of professional courtesy not\nnecessary to a valid judgment. Approval as to form does not waive any error in the proceedings or incident to the judgment\nitself.

The best witness that the parties did not consider the\njudgment's recited signing date as material to their agreement is the uniform manner in which all parties overlooked the July\n2002 recited date until this Court pointed it out in 2006.\n\nAdditionally, the signing dates recited in judgments are intended to reflect reality, not some different agreement of the parties.\n“Judges, attorneys and clerks are directed to use their best efforts to cause all judgments ... to be reduced to writing and signed\nby the trial judge with the date of signing stated therein.” TEX.R.

The rule contemplates that each judgment\nshould accurately reflect the date it was actually signed by the court; it does not seem to contemplate allowing parties to include\nan agreed date of signing into the terms of consent judgments.\n\nWe decline to treat the originally recited judgment signing date as part of any agreement of the parties.\n\n\n(3) The Date Change Is Supported by the Record\n [19] The Claxtons also argue that the nunc pro tunc judgment is unsupported by the record.

This is consistent with the\nrequirements of Rule 316 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires that such clerical mistakes may “be corrected\nby the judge in open court according to the truth....” See TEX.R. CIV. P. 316. Though a fairly loose version of evidence is\nallowed, with cases relying on the judge's recollections and on the argument of counsel, nevertheless, that evidence must be\nsufficiently clear and convincing to allow the trial court to conclude that clerical error exists.\n\nIn this case, the record now contains a transcription of a brief hearing held January 17, 2007. At the hearing, the trial court\nreviewed the court's files and examined the transcript of the September 2002 hearing.\n\nThe trial court stated in its January 16, 2007, order that it decided to grant the judgment nunc pro tunc based on its review of\nthe “Court's official file (including the official transcript of the proceedings occurring on 09/06/02 in open court)....” 9\n\n\nThe District argues that the trial court's determination is supported by the record because the earlier date was logically absurd. 10\nIt bases this conclusion on several *546 factors. One is the obvious fact that no party treated the motion for new trial as being\nuntimely—even though, based on the stated date of signing, it clearly was. All parties simply continued filing pleadings as\nthough the motion for new trial was timely. As the District points out, no party resisted the 2002 motion for new trial based on\na lack of jurisdiction, and, before this Court reviewed the record and recognized the problem, this issue was never raised.\n\nCertainly, a party cannot confer or waive jurisdiction either by consent or agreement. Stine v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2426751\"><a href=\"/opinion/2426751/stine-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1995).\nThe mere fact that the parties behaved as though the trial court retained jurisdiction over the case does not confer jurisdiction\nto the court. But the behavior by both counsel and trial court on such an absolutely basic concept supports a conclusion that\neveryone involved knew the 2002 judgment was not actually signed on the earlier date. The District argues that the sole\nexplanation for the behavior of all involved was clearly that the judgment was not signed until the later date. 11\n\nFoolish or perfunctory behavior by counsel or court is a staple of appeals. Although we would prefer to think that such errors\nwould not occur, they do. Counsel for the District has directed us to no specific portion of the reporter's record from the\nSeptember 2, 2002, hearing to support the argument that the evidence clearly supports the court's decision. Given the brevity of\nthe record, however, we have nonetheless reviewed the transcription of that hearing to see if it supports the court's ruling. It does.\n\n\n [26]     [27] The September hearing commenced with only one attorney present, representing the Lynns. 12 The court\nacknowledged that the District and the Claxtons had sent in an agreed order granting the motion for summary judgment. The\ntrial court then questioned the Lynns' counsel at length about any ability they might have to complain about the judgment in\nthe absence of any affirmative cross-pleadings against either the Claxtons or the District. The Lynns' counsel repeatedly asked\nthe court not to enter the order just because the two parties agreed to it.

And being a party, we would like the opportunity to address the Court to tell the Court why it shouldn't enter\n    this order....\n    (Emphasis added.) On page twelve of the record, counsel stated, “I would like for the Court to know that by the order that's\n    submitted to you, if you sign it, you will be ordering....” (Emphasis added.) At the end of the hearing, the trial court stated\n    that it would grant the nonsuit and then “will enter the agreed order between the two remaining parties.” That dialogue *547\n   seems to demonstrate that the judgment was indeed signed in September, not July. 13\nIn the January 16, 2007, nunc pro tunc hearing, the trial court reviewed the transcription of the prior hearing, heard argument\nby counsel, and reviewed a letter dated September 3, 2002, that appears to be a transmittal letter accompanying a delivery of\nthe 2002 judgment to the trial court just before the September 6 hearing.\n\nThe trial court did not state either in writing or orally that it was relying on its personal recollection to determine that an error\nexisted, and the discussion between counsel and court at the hearing suggests to the contrary. In that situation, we will not\nconclusively presume that it was doing so, especially in light of the five-year delay between the judgment and the judgment\nnunc pro tunc.

It is reasonable to assume he recalled the\ncontext of the September 2002 hearing, at least once his recollection was refreshed in 2006. The language used in the 2002\nhearing is best understood as indicating that the proposed judgment had not been signed to that point. That conclusion is\nfurther supported by the transmittal letter reviewed by the court. There is factually and legally sufficient evidence to support\nthe rendition of the judgment nunc pro tunc.\n\nBecause the nunc pro tunc change in the recited judgment date was valid, the District's subsequent motion for new trial was\ntimely. Therefore, the subsequent, 2006, judgment was effective and became the final judgment of the trial court.\n\nWe grant the District's motion for rehearing and reinstate the appeal.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      An order nunc pro tunc, correcting only a true clerical error, may be granted by a trial court at any time, even after it has lost jurisdiction\n         over the case.

This argument is circular. The “impossibility” is based on the assumption that the later date\n      is correct, which is the issue the District is trying to prove by showing impossibility.\n11    The alternative, according to the District's brief, was that this is the only rational explanation for what would otherwise be\n      “outrageously irresponsible (if not downright dumb) behavior by both the Trial Court and the parties' counsel. .... in completely\n      ignoring the procedural provisions of Rule 329b.”\n12    The Lynns were defendants in the case, but all claims against them were disposed of by nonsuit, as reflected in the judgment.\n13    A potential problem with this evidence lies in the fact that “entering” a judgment and “signing” a judgment are by no means\n      synonymous concepts.

City of Mesquite, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980)\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\nHUMPHREYS, Justice.\n\nThis is an appeal from an order denying declaratory relief to appellant, D. C. Cleere. Cleere petitioned the court to declare that a\n1974 order requiring him to remove automobile parts from his premises is not an injunction and that it is null and void because\nit does not meet the requirements of Tex.R.Civ.P. 683. We affirm.\n\nThe order here resulted from an action in 1974 by the City of Mesquite, to enjoin Cleere from operating an automobile repair\ngarage, selling automobile parts, and operating a wrecking yard on his premises. The 1974 order was an agreed order, prohibiting\nappellant from storing at his residence automobiles and automobile parts. In 1979, the city filed a contempt proceeding against\nCleere, alleging a violation of this order. Cleere counter-claimed for a declaration pursuant to Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2524-1\n(Vernon 1965) that the order was not a valid injunction. The court found that he was not in contempt, but that the agreed order\nwas “in force and effect as a permanent injunction.”\n\n [1] Cleere argues that the court erred in refusing to review the 1974 order under the Declaratory Judgment Act, which allows\nan interested person to have his rights construed under a written contract, and that the court erred in finding the agreed order\nwas a permanent injunction. We conclude that the court had no power to review its previous order. Any attack on the injunction\nin this proceeding is a collateral attack and cannot succeed unless the injunction is void. The court may determine, however,\nwhether the order is a valid permanent injunction. The question then is whether the court's finding that this is a valid permanent\ninjunction was error.\n\nThe agreed order decrees as follows:\n\n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Defendant is to remove all junk automobile cars,\n  transmissions and junk automobile parts from his premises; that the Defendant is not to allow said automobiles on his property\n  for a period longer than 24 hours, nor is he to store for commercial purposes any automobile transmissions or other junk\n  automobile parts; that if said parts or transmissions are stored for personal use, they must be stored in a building on Defendant's\n  property.\n\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that there will be no work on automobiles on Defendant's\n  premises located at 1123 Peachtree Road, Mesquite, Texas, except for work on the automobiles of Defendant's immediate\n  family, no unloading of automobile parts and transmissions except for the personal use of the Defendant and his immediate\n  family, and shall not allow impact wrenches or other noisy equipment to be used on his property after 10:00 o'clock p. m.\n\nCleere argues that this order is not a valid injunction because it does not explicitly use the words “restrain” or “enjoin” with\nrespect to the activities prohibited. We do not agree. Admittedly the restraining language *833 is unusual, but its intent to\nimpose a permanent restraint is evident.\n\n [2] Cleere also complains that the order does not comply with Tex.R.Civ.P. 683. That rule requires every order granting an\ninjunction to set forth the reasons for its issuance, be specific in terms and describe the acts sought to be restrained in detail.\nCleere contends that this order sets forth no reasons for its issuance and is not specific in its terms. Although the reasons are\nnot specified in the order, this defect does not invalidate the injunction under the circumstances shown here. The purpose of\nthe requirement for reasons is to inform the violator of why he is enjoined. Board of Equalization of City of Plano v.

When a party agrees to an injunction, he is in no position to complain\nthat he was not informed of the reasons.\n\nFurthermore, we hold that the order is sufficiently definite in its terms to apprise Cleere of the acts he can and cannot undertake.\nThe only indefiniteness suggested by appellant is that he cannot tell from the order what is commercial use and what is personal\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because of this disagreement, the trial judge intervened and appointed an arbitrator to preside over their\ndispute. CMH Homes filed an interlocutory appeal challenging this appointment, requesting in the alternative that its appeal\nbe treated as a mandamus petition.

Facts and Procedure\n\nOn October 2, 2002, Adam Perez purchased a manufactured home from CMH Homes, with the help of salesman Bruce Robinson\nMoore Jr. Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance provided financing for the purchase. The retail installment contract between CMH\nHomes and Perez contained an arbitration clause which provides:\n\n            All disputes, claims or controversies arising from or relating to this contract ... shall be resolved by\n            mandatory binding arbitration by one arbitrator selected by Seller with Buyer's consent.\n\n\n *447 On November 2, 2009, Perez sued CMH Homes, Inc., Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc., and Bruce Robinson Moore\nJr. (hereinafter “CMH Homes”) for fraud and violations of the Texas Debt Collection Act in the financing of his manufactured\nhome. Perez filed a motion to compel arbitration on January 13, 2010. Although the parties agreed that the contract was governed\nby the Federal Arbitration Act and agreed to submit to arbitration, they could not agree to an arbitrator. After two months of\ndisagreement, with both parties suggesting arbitrators in various correspondence, Perez's attorney declared an impasse. 1 On\nMarch 8, 2010, after a hearing, the trial court issued an order appointing Gilberto Hinojosa as arbitrator. Although the order\nwas titled “Order on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration,” the only directive in the order was to name an arbitrator to\npreside over the dispute.\n\nCMH Homes filed an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.016, challenging the\ncourt's appointment of Gilberto Hinojosa as arbitrator.

Discussion\n\nFirst, we must determine whether the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\nsection 51.016 of an interlocutory appeal of an order appointing an arbitrator. If section 51.016 does not provide jurisdiction,\nwe then decide whether the court of appeals should have considered CMH Homes's interlocutory appeal as a petition for writ\nof mandamus.\n\n\n\n                                 A. Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 51.016\n\n [5] Prior to the Legislature's 2009 amendment to the Texas Arbitration Act (TAA), parties seeking to appeal an order\nrefusing to compel arbitration would commonly file two separate appellate proceedings. Under the TAA, a party could bring\nan interlocutory appeal of an order denying arbitration. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 171.098. Under the Federal\nArbitration Act (FAA), a party could only challenge an order denying arbitration by mandamus. Jack B. Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at\n271–72. As a result, parallel proceedings were the norm in Texas arbitration disputes where parties were unsure which arbitration\nact applied. Although “unnecessarily expensive and cumbersome,” such parallel proceedings were required. Id. at 272. Twice,\nthis Court requested that the Legislature “consider amending the Texas Act to permit interlocutory appeals of orders issued\npursuant to the Federal Act.” Id.; In re D. Wilson Constr.

The order\nat issue is entitled “Order on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration” and appoints Gilberto Hinojosa as arbitrator. Although\nPerez's motion to compel arbitration did not request that the trial court appoint an arbitrator, Perez submitted letters to the court\nadministrator declaring an impasse and requesting the trial judge appoint an arbitrator.\n\nAt first glance, this order may appear to fit within section 16(b)(2) as an order “directing arbitration to proceed.” 9 U.S.C. §\n16(b)(2). The “Order on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration” was issued in response to Perez's motion requesting that the\ntrial court compel arbitration. But the substance of the order is the appointment of Gilberto Hinojosa as arbitrator. See Del Valle\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429810\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429810/del-valle-indep-school-dist-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (Tex.1992) (“[I]t is the character and function of an order that determine its\nclassification.”). While it may be argued that by appointing an arbitrator the order implicitly compels the parties to arbitration,\nthe order does not explicitly grant Perez's motion to compel and does not explicitly compel the parties to arbitrate their dispute.\nThere is no question that both parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute; the open question remaining was who would serve as\nthe arbitrator. The purpose of the order was to answer that question.\n\nSection 5 of the FAA explicitly permits a trial court to appoint an arbitrator under certain circumstances. 9 U.S.C. § 5. Where\nthe parties have previously agreed to a method for selecting an arbitrator, the parties must follow that method. Id. However,\nif the agreed upon method breaks down and there is a lapse in appointing an arbitrator, the parties may petition the trial court\nto appoint an arbitrator. Id.\n\n [7] An order appointing an arbitrator under section 5 is neither listed in section 16(a) (where appeals may be taken) nor in\nsection 16(b) (where appeals may not be taken). 9 U.S.C. § 16(a), (b). Even though section 16 is silent on the matter, CMH\nHomes argues that an appeal of an order appointing an arbitrator is “permitted by Section 16” because some federal circuit\ncases may have entertained interlocutory appeals regarding appointment of arbitrators pursuant to section 5. 2 However, none\nof the cited cases mentions whether the appeal is interlocutory and all but one of the cited cases fails to specifically discuss\nits jurisdictional basis or cite section 16. 3 Nat'l Am.

Although we presume\na court always evaluates its jurisdiction before deciding a matter, these cases do not indicate whether their jurisdictional basis\nwas section 16, and if so, whether the basis was section 16(a)(3) for final orders. 5 The only federal circuit case that speaks\ndirectly to the jurisdictional issue is O.P.C. Farms Inc. v. Conopco Inc., which held that under section 16, the trial court's order\nappointing an arbitrator was not a final decision and was thus unappealable. 6 *451 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757690\"><a href=\"/opinion/757690/opc-farms-inc-v-conopco-inc-a-new-york-corporation-dba-van-den-bergh/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1048–49 (9th Cir.1998).\nThe court explained: “[T]he only basis for an appeal ... that could even be plausibly argued is § 16(a)(3). It is, however, clear\nthat the appointment of the third arbitrator is not the final decision in this case.... Consequently § 16 effectively deprives us\nof jurisdiction.” Id.\n\nThe appellate jurisdiction of Texas courts in this case is based on federal law. The court of appeals had jurisdiction to consider the\ntrial court's order if “appeal ... would be permitted by 9 U.S.C. Section 16” in federal court. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE\n§ 51.016. Because there is no apparent federal approach to judicial review under section 16 of orders appointing arbitrators,\nwe will not extrapolate jurisdiction from a dearth of federal authority to allow an interlocutory appeal where the law is unclear\nand section 16 suggests otherwise.\n\nBefore the enactment of section 51.016, we specifically invited the Legislature “ ‘[i]n the interests of promoting the policy\nconsiderations of rigorous and expedited enforcement of arbitration agreements, ... to consider amending the Texas Act to\npermit interlocutory appeals of orders issued pursuant to the Federal Act.’ ” See In re D. Wilson, 196 S.W.3d at 780 n. 4\n(quoting Jack B. Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at 272). While we agree the Legislature added section 51.016 to prevent unnecessary\nparallel proceedings, this inconsistency generally arose when parties were unsure whether the TAA or the FAA applied to their\nagreement. See Jack B. Anglin, 842 S.W.2d at 272 (“[L]itigants who allege entitlement to arbitration under the Federal Act, and\nin the alternative, under the Texas Act, are burdened with the need to pursue parallel proceedings—an interlocutory appeal of\nthe trial court's denial under the Texas Act, and a writ of mandamus from the denial under the Federal Act.”).

CMH Homes did not agree to the proposed order and offered to submit\n        two more arbitrator names for Perez's consideration. Instead, Perez sent a copy of the proposed order to the court and suggested three\n        possible arbitrators for the court to appoint. In response, CMH Homes sent a letter to the court explaining that under the arbitration\n        provision, CMH Homes, not Perez, has the right to designate the arbitrator and suggested two more arbitrators. The letter also indicates\n        that the parties were considering one of the two arbitrators, Donato Ramos, but Perez was concerned about conflicts of interests\n        because his attorneys had financial connections to Ramos. The court held a hearing on February 9, 2010 where the parties appeared\n        to agree to the appointment of Ramos. However, when the parties could not agree to a waiver of conflicts for Ramos, the agreement\n        fell apart. Perez notified the court that they could not reach an agreed waiver and again asked the court to appoint an arbitrator and\n        re-submitted the three names previously suggested, including Gilberto Hinojosa.\n2       CMH Homes relies upon the following cases: Nat'l Am.

In In\n       re Gulf Exploration, LLC, we explained:\n             Arbitrability is often the only issue in federal court because nondiverse parties may prevent removal of the underlying case from\n             state court; in such cases, even a stay order will be considered final if the federal action is effectively over. But in the state courts,\n             disputes about arbitrability and the merits must usually proceed in a single court under rules of dominant jurisdiction.\n             Accordingly, a stay is generally the only appropriate order for a state court with jurisdiction of all issues. Indeed, the Texas\n             Arbitration Act states that “[a]n order compelling arbitration must include a stay” of the underlying litigation. During arbitration,\n             a court order may be needed to replace an arbitrator, compel attendance of witnesses, or direct arbitrators to proceed promptly;\n             after arbitration, a court order is needed to confirm, modify, or vacate the arbitration award. Consequently, dismissal would\n             usually be inappropriate because the trial court cannot dispose of all claims and all parties until arbitration is completed.\n          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895105\"><a href=\"/opinion/895105/in-re-gulf-exploration-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 840–41 (Tex.2009) (citations omitted).\n5      The appellants in National American and ACEquip represented to the circuit courts that the order being appealed was final.

Hamilton, Senior Appellate Disciplinary Counsel, Office\nof the Chief Disc. Counsel, for Commission for Lawyer Discipline.\n\nHeather Ann Badgett Schaefer, Plano, for Appellee.\n\nOpinion\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\nDistrict Grievance Committees appoint evidentiary panels for attorney disciplinary actions, and quorums of the evidentiary\npanels hear and decide the actions. This case raises the question of whether a properly constituted quorum of an improperly\nconstituted evidentiary panel has the authority to act in an attorney disciplinary matter. Following a unanimous finding of\nmisconduct by an evidentiary panel quorum, an attorney appealed the panel's order of disbarment to the Board of Disciplinary\nAppeals (BODA) on the ground that the evidentiary panel was not composed of the required ratio of public to attorney members.\n\nThe attorney failed to attend her hearing and filed no post-judgment motions with the evidentiary panel. BODA vacated the\npanel's judgment and remanded for a new hearing because the evidentiary panel was improperly composed, even though\nthe quorum of panelists present for the hearing met the required ratio of lawyers to non-lawyers. BODA concluded the\npanel-composition error voided the panel's judgment for lack of capacity. We agree with BODA that the composition of\nevidentiary panels, a mandatory requirement, was not met here. However, we conclude that requirement is not jurisdictional\nand the evidentiary panel's order was voidable, not void. Therefore, because no objection was lodged to the evidentiary panel's\ncomposition, we reverse BODA's judgment.\n\nComplaints of attorney misconduct are assessed by the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel (CDC) of the State Bar of\nTexas, which administers the attorney disciplinary system at the investigatory and trial levels. TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P.\n1.06(C), 5.01, .02. CDC investigates complaints to determine whether there is just cause that an attorney committed professional\nmisconduct. Id. at 1.06(U) & (V), 2.12, 5.02(C). Upon a determination of just cause by CDC, the accused attorney may have\nher case heard in (1) district court, upon election, with or without a jury or (2) in an administrative proceeding by an evidentiary\npanel of a State Bar of Texas District Grievance Committee (Grievance Committee) within the relevant geographic district.

See TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P. 5.02(C), (G), (I) & (M) (laying out in relevant part the duties of the CDC in\ndisciplinary proceedings). As Schaefer did not elect to have the grievances heard in district court, CDC assigned them to\nan evidentiary panel. Id. at 2.14, .15. The Chair of the relevant Grievance Committee, District 01A (Collin County, Texas),\nappointed a six-person evidentiary panel to hear the case. Schaefer filed an eve-of-trial “emergency continuance” on the basis\nof work conflicts, which the evidentiary panel denied. Schaefer did not attend her hearing. At the hearing in Schaefer's absence,\na quorum of evidentiary panel members unanimously found that Schaefer committed misconduct, and disbarred her in its\njudgment.\n\nAlthough the pre-hearing notices Schaefer received from the CDC showed a properly constituted evidentiary panel, the panel's\n“Evidentiary Hearing Report” (hearing report), summarizing basic information about the hearing, including the identity of the\npanelists present, listed the second public-member position on the six-person panel as “vacant.” The hearing was held February\n20, 2009; the hearing report was sent to Schaefer on March 2, 2009; and the evidentiary panel's judgment was signed on March\n3, 2009. The hearing report indicated that a quorum of four panel members, three attorneys and one public member, were\nactually present to hear Schaefer's case. Schaefer did not object to the panel's composition at the hearing or subsequently in any\npost-judgment motion. See TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.22 (describing post-judgment motions).\n\nSchaefer appealed to BODA, challenging the evidentiary panel's composition. On appeal, BODA vacated the disbarment\njudgment and remanded for a new hearing, in part on the basis that the evidentiary panel did not have the capacity to act\nbecause the panel was improperly composed. 1 BODA found that the evidentiary panel lacked the appropriate ratio of attorney\nmembers to public members and, reasoning that such error was fundamental, concluded that evidentiary panels not satisfying\nthis requirement lack capacity to act as a court. Schaefer v. Comm'n for Lawyer Discipline of the State Bar of Tex., Bd. of\nDisciplinary Appeals Case No. 44292 (Jan. 28, 2011) at 8, 14. The Commission appealed to this Court, challenging BODA's\ninterpretation of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure governing evidentiary-panel composition. We issued a *835\nsummary affirmance of BODA's judgment and later granted the Commission's motion for rehearing.\n\n [2] Appeals from determinations of BODA are generally reviewed under a substantial evidence standard. TEX.R.\nDISCIPLINARY P. 7.11. Because the issue before us involves the interpretation of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure,\nwe review BODA's legal conclusions on the construction of the rules de novo.

Id. at 414. Under the wording of 2.07, different from 2.02 and 2.17, we held that the quorum\nthat heard the disciplinary action satisfied the ratio requirement that it “ ‘include one public member for each two attorney\nmembers.’ ” Id. at 417 (quoting TEX.

Schaefer's case\nis different from Allison in that the evidentiary panel from which the quorum was drawn included only one public member and\nfour attorney members, although the quorum satisfied Allison 's three-attorney-to-one-public-member ratio under 2.07. See 288\nS.W.3d at 417.

Allison, 288\nS.W.3d at 417. In Allison, we explained:\n\n             [T]he factor-of-two rule applies only when there is an even number of attorneys. Thus, if there are four\n             attorney members (two sets of two) a quorum would require two public members.\n\nId. The evidentiary panel failed to meet this requirement. BODA and the Commission disagree over whether this improper panel\ncomposition deprived the evidentiary panel of capacity to act on the complaints, and consequently rendered the evidentiary\npanel's judgment void, or merely voidable.\n\nBODA concluded in its opinion that two of our precedents, Mapco, Inc. v. Forrest, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2368794\"><a href=\"/opinion/2368794/mapco-inc-v-forrest/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1990), and Tesco\nAmerican, Inc. v.

The Commission argues, however, that the Grievance\nCommittee's failure to abide by the panel composition requirements did not deprive the evidentiary panel of capacity, but merely\nrendered the judgment voidable. Because Schaefer, who was not present at the hearing, did not object to the composition of\nthe evidentiary panel or *836 file a post-judgment motion challenging its composition, the Commission also contends that\nany error was waived.\n\nWe construe the analogous precedents differently. Mapco concerned an appellate ruling in which one justice of a three-justice\npanel retired before an opinion was issued, resulting in a one-one opinion and judgment, a departure from both statutory and\nconstitutional provisions requiring a “majority” of a panel for a decision on a case. Mapco, 795 S.W.2d at 702–03. We declined\nto issue a general rule that a violation of a procedural rule, statute, or even a constitutional requirement rendered an appellate\njudgment “void.” Id. at 703. Instead, such violations generally only result in a “voidable” or erroneous judgment. Id. Describing\nthe “rare circumstances” that would void a judgment, we observed that “[a] judgment is void only when it is apparent that the\ncourt rendering the judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties, no jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the\njudgment, or no capacity to act as a court.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\nTesco concerned a judicial-disqualification challenge to a court of appeals decision. Tesco, 221 S.W.3d at 552–53. We held that\nthe justice authoring the unanimous opinion for the three-justice panel was disqualified due to an imputed conflict of interest. Id.\nat 554.

However, we held that,\nin the appellate context, where multiple judges are empaneled, a judgment is merely voidable unless every judge on the panel\nis disqualified. Id. at 555–56. We explained that, “ ‘[i]n general, as long as the court entering a judgment has jurisdiction of the\nparties and the subject matter and does not act outside its capacity as a court, the judgment is not void.’ ” Id. at 556 (quoting\nReiss v. Reiss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2331008\"><a href=\"/opinion/2331008/reiss-v-reiss/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443 (Tex.2003)). We concluded that the judgment at issue was not void as the appellate court\nhad “jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, jurisdiction to enter judgment, and capacity to act as a court.” Id.\n\nBODA's opinion distinguished Mapco and Tesco as involving appellate panels and analogized the evidentiary panel at issue\nhere to a trial court. Schaefer, at 14. For purposes of the applicable composition rules, the multi-member nature of an evidentiary\npanel makes it analogous to the appellate courts in Mapco and Tesco. Accordingly, the evidentiary panel's judgment was not\nvoid for lack of capacity. We therefore reverse BODA's judgment.\n\n [5] [6] [7] As the attorney-to-public-member composition requirement does not undermine the capacity of an evidentiary\npanel or otherwise deprive it of jurisdiction to hear evidence and issue disciplinary orders, error must be preserved by timely\nobjection.

Id. The Grievance Committee should timely\nadvise respondent attorneys of the composition of the evidentiary panel from which the quorum was drawn to hear the case. But\ngenerally speaking, reasonable diligence by the attorney requires more than occurred here. Faced with an incomplete evidentiary\npanel, the respondent attorney must inquire as to panel composition and object if the composition requirements are not satisfied.\nShould an attorney fail to appear at an evidentiary hearing, she makes her task more difficult and should obtain the hearing\nreport and preserve error through a timely post-judgment motion. See TEX.R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.22.\n\n [8] The evidentiary panel's composition violated the requirements of Rules 2.07 and 2.17 of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary\nProcedure. That violation, however, did not deprive the evidentiary panel of its capacity to select a quorum, hear evidence,\nand issue a judgment. Therefore, in the absence of a timely objection, error was waived.

In September 2005, Darrell Haun acquired 51% of the shares\nof Solarcraft. Contemporaneously, the Conlins signed employment agreements with Solarcraft. The employment agreements\nincluded a non-compete provision that provided “[f]or 3 years following termination of employment, Employee agrees not\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(collectively, “Haun”) sued the Conlins, alleging they violated their non-compete\nagreements. Haun sought to enjoin the Conlins from competing with Solarcraft and from having access to Solarcraft facilities\nand information. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order as requested by Haun on February 2, 2009.\n\nOn February 19, 2009, the trial court heard Haun's application for a temporary injunction. However, before the trial court ruled\non the application, the parties informed it that they had reached an agreement regarding temporary injunctive relief. On February\n24, 2009, the trial court signed an order titled “Agreed Temporary Injunction,” which enjoined the Conlins from competing with\nSolarcraft in various ways, and enjoined Haun from tampering with Solarcraft records and data, including financial records.\nThe order stated that it was effective “until the trial of this cause, or further order of this Court.” It contained a blank in which\nthe trial setting date could be written, but the blank was not filled in.\n\nOn July 23, 2009, the Conlins moved to dissolve the temporary injunction. They contended that the injunction should be\ndissolved because (1) it was void under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 because it failed to state the reasons for its issuance\nand set a date for trial, and (2) Kathryn's three-year covenant not to compete had expired. The parties agree that the trial court\norally denied the motion on October 9, 2009, but the record contains no written order on this motion.\n\nMore than three years later, on February 27, 2013, the Conlins filed a second motion to dissolve the temporary injunction. The\nConlins argued, as they had in their 2009 motion to dissolve, that the agreed temporary injunction order was void under Texas\nRule of Civil Procedure 683 because it failed to state the reasons for its issuance and failed to set the case for trial. They also\nargued that changed circumstances warranted the dissolution of the temporary injunction. Specifically, the Conlins argued that\nbecause they were forcibly removed from Solarcraft on February 2, 2009, the three-year covenants not to compete expired, at\nthe latest, on February 2, 2012, and therefore there was no remaining basis for enjoining them from competing with Solarcraft.\nIn addition, the Conlins argued that they had sold all of their shares in Solarcraft to Haun on January 19, 2013, and they now\nheld no interests in Solarcraft. After a hearing on April 1, 2013, at which the trial court orally denied the Conlins' motion, the\ntrial court *685 signed a written order denying the motion to dissolve on April 15, 2013. The Conlins filed a notice of appeal\nfrom the trial court's denial of the motion on April 8, 2013.\n\n\n\n                                                            Discussion\n\nThe Conlins raise two issues on appeal. First, they argue that the agreed temporary injunction order is void for failure to state the\nreasons for its issuance or set the cause for trial, as required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683. Second, and alternatively,\nthey argue the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to modify or dissolve the temporary injunction because no basis for\nthe injunction remained after the Conlins' non-compete agreements expired and the Conlins sold their ownership interest in\nSolarcraft.\n\nHaun does not dispute that the temporary injunction order does not comply with the requirements of Rule 683. Instead, Haun\nargues that (1) we lack jurisdiction because the Conlins failed to appeal within 20 days after the trial court denied the Conlins'\nfirst motion to dissolve in 2009, and (2) the Conlins are estopped from challenging the temporary injunction order because they\nagreed to it. We address Haun's challenge to our jurisdiction before turning to the merits.\n\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n [1] Haun contends that the Conlins' appeal was untimely because their notice of appeal was not filed within 20 days of the date\nthe trial court denied their first motion to dissolve in 2009. He contends “[b]ecause they failed to timely appeal the denial of their\nfirst Motion To Dissolve Temporary Injunction in October of 2009, the Conlins waived any errors regarding compliance with\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The cases Haun cites do not support that contention. They merely stand for the\nproposition that, when an appellate court reviews a trial court's order on a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction, it reviews\nthe trial court's decision to grant or deny the motion to dissolve, and not the trial court's original decision to grant a temporary\ninjunction.

Reiss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2331008\"><a href=\"/opinion/2331008/reiss-v-reiss/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.2003),\ndid not address the validity of temporary injunction orders in any way.

Haun argues this means that the\nagreed order in this case is merely voidable, and not void, and that a party who has agreed to a voidable order may not attack\nthat order on appeal. The In re Garza court rejected this argument, holding that Qwest clearly stated that an order that failed\nto comply with Rule 683 was void. In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273.\n\n [5] Our sister court, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, has followed In re Garza and held that an “Agreed Mutual Temporary\nInjunction” order that did not comply with the mandatory requirements of Rule 683 was void and must be dissolved. See In re\nCorcoran, 343 S.W.3d at 269. We likewise find In re Garza persuasive and follow it and In re Corcoran here. Accordingly,\nthe Conlins are not estopped from complaining about the “Agreed Temporary Injunction” order's failure to comply with the\nmandatory requirements of Rule 683. Here, it is undisputed that the order does not set the case for trial. Accordingly, we\nconclude the Agreed Temporary Injunction must be dissolved. See Intercontinental Terminals Co., 354 S.W.3d at 892; Qwest,\n24 S.W.3d at 337; In re Corcoran, 343 S.W.3d at 269; In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273; Kaufmann, 93 S.W.3d at 656.\n\nWe sustain the Conlins' first issue. Because we have concluded that the temporary injunction order must be dissolved, we do\nnot reach the Conlins' second issue.\n\n\n\n                                                          Conclusion\n\nWe reverse the trial court's order denying the Conlins' motion to dissolve and remand with instructions to the trial court to\ndissolve the temporary injunction.

As to whether an infant's power of attorney is void or merely voidable.\n\nThe sale and delivery of chattels by a minor may be avoided while under age; but the sale of real estate by a minor cannot\nbe avoided on the ground of infancy merely until after he arrives at full age, although it seems he may enter and enjoy the\nrents and profits.\n\nNo case has been cited in which an infant has by himself or guardian attempted, while within age, to recover lands passed from\nhim by an executed conveyance on the ground of infancy merely, and it is probable that none such can be shown.\n\nQuere? Where an infant has sold real estate, and after arriving at full age wishes to avoid the sale, whether he ought not to give\nnotice of his intention to disaffirm before bringing suit.\n\nWhere it is sought to set aside a sale of real estate on the ground of infancy, there should be an offer to restore the purchase-\nmoney.

Hence the right to control and avoid\nany of those acts which could dispossess them, and to sue for and recover their property; to eject trespassers, and do everything\nfor them which they could do to protect their own interests if they were of lawful age. The guardian is the legal representative\nof the infant. Clerke says, speaking of infants, “His acts are either void or voidable. This distinction is not conclusively settled,\nalthough the opinion of Lord Chief Justice Eyre is regarded with much satisfaction, that when the court could pronounce the\ncontract to be prejudicial to the infant, it was void; when beneficial, valid; when of dubious benefit or prejudice, voidable only\nat his election.” (Rudiments and Practice, p. 57.) According to this view of the case, when the infant, by his legal representative,\nelects to declare the deed void, will the court undertake to say, upon looking at the petition, that it is beneficial and valid? The\ncourt below, having high chancery jurisdiction, will protect the rights of infants, being their guardian. But we think by the law\nthe deed to Powell is void and not voidable. Story says, “And in respect to the acts of infants of a more solemn nature, such\nas deeds, gifts, and grants, this distinction *83 has been insisted on; that such as do take effect by delivery of his hand are\nvoidable; but such as do not so take effect are void.” (Eq. vol. 1, sec. 241; see authorities there cited, Zouch v. Parsons, 3 Burr.\nR., 1794; Perkins, sec. 12; 8 Am. Jurist, 327, et seq.) Nor is it necessary to aver specific fraud. The act itself is a fraud. (1 Story's\nEq., sec. 242.) So far as the opinion of the civilians is of weight, they are decided on the point. Grotius places a contract with\nan infant on the same footing with one made with a lunatic or an idiot. (De jure Belli. Grot., B. 2, ch. 11, sec. 5; so also the\nInstitute, Lib. 3, Tit. 20, secs. 8 and 10; Dig., Lib. 50, Tit. 17; Paudicts, B. 2, Tit. 38, p. 216, et seq.\n\nIn the different States many conflicting authorities are found. In Connecticut, unless the contracts have a semblance of advantage\nto the infant, they are void, (4 Day, 59; 6 Conn., 494;) North Carolina, (1 Hayw. R., 143; Hoyle v. Stowe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Dev.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">& Batt. R.,\n320;) Maryland, (Fudge v. The State, 3 Gill. & Johns. R., 103; 11 Id., 314; Salmon v. Claggett, 3 Bland Ch. R., 125; (New\nYork, (Bool v. Mix, 17 Wend. R., 119;) but still the infant may enter and take profits; (Stafford v. Root, 9 Cowen, 626; Roof\nv. Stafford, 7 Id., 22,) decided both ways.\n\nAn infant's legal representatives can avoid a deed made by the former. (Roberts v. Wiggin, 1 N. H. R., 73. Clerke lays down\nthe same rule. (Rud. and Practice, 57.\n\nAll the books say there must be an affirmance; and the most of them say it must be express. (19 Wend. R., 301; 14 Johns. R., 124.)\n\nIn the case of Wheaton v. East, (5 Yerg. R., 41,) the doctrine is laid down that the contract is voidable. Yet the court heard all\nthe proof to show the consideration; that it was fair and full; that the minor wanted but a few months of his majority when he\nmade the contract, and did not bring his suit for nearly four years after the sale.\n\nThe petition, in asking that the deed to Powell be declared void, and that they be remitted to the possession of the premises,\n *84 asks nothing inconsistent with either view of the law. They aver in their petition that Powell fraudulently procured them\nto join with their brother William in the execution of the deed of the 15th May, 1846; that they were then, and still are, minors;\nthey aver no sale; no considerations; but charge that Powell fraudulently procured them to execute the deed.\n\nThe fact of their infancy is a badge of fraud. (1 Story's Eq., sec. 242, above cited.) The petition certainly shows sufficient on\nits face to authorize the court below to hear the proof. Whether the deed be void or voidable the guardian can avoid it. Can he\ndo it in any other way than by asking the court in behalf of his wards to set it aside? Or can he be justified in submitting to\nthe adverse possession of the defendants, and permitting them to reap the fruits and destroy the lands and timber till his wards\ncome of age? Suppose his wards were to call him to account for the way he had managed their estate, would he be excused\nby setting up this conveyance to Powell? The adoption of such a principle would release every guardian who chose to have\nhis ward's property wasted. (6 Rand. R., 556.)\n\nIf the guardian or his wards wished to disaffirm a sale made by his wards, a suit is conclusive evidence of that disaffirmance.\n(Sellars v. Davis, 4 Yerg. R., 506.)\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                   3\n\fCummings v.

And the court below, sitting as a\ncourt of equity, if it would not avoid the deed of the minors, should at least have remitted them to the possession and given it to\nthe guardian for the debts of the minors for necessaries, for expenses of guardianship, &c. But if he is estopped by their deed,\na guardian is liable to be defrauded by a stranger's meddling with the estate of his wards, and has no remedy.\n\nHEMPHILL, CH. J.\n\nThe ground upon which the demurrer was supported below, and which has been urged, is that the *85 deed made by the minors\nwas not void, but voidable, and could be avoided by them only after attaining majority.\n\nWe will consider, in the first place, whether the deed be void or voidable. It is important to ascertain the exact signification of\nthese terms, as upon that depends the character of the act, and the rights, obligations, and liabilities of parties and of strangers to\nthe transaction. A void act, as defined in the latter cases and by approved authorities, is one which is entirely null, not binding\non either party, and not susceptible of ratification; and a voidable act is one which is obligatory upon others until disaffirmed\nby the party with whom it originated and which may be subsequently ratified or confirmed. Such is the import of these terms;\nbut on examining the earlier cases it will be found that they were frequently confounded. The term void was frequently used\nwhen it was intended to imply only that the act was not binding, or that its obligation might be avoided by the infants. (Bingham\non Infancy, p. 18.)\n\nAs questions growing out of the acts of minors, under our former laws, may and will arise, it may be well to remember that the\ndistinction between void and voidable, as recognized by the authorities at common law in relation to this special subject, is not\nknown to Spanish jurisprudence; at least a void act is not characterized by all of the same incidents.\n\nFor instance, one of the results of the nullity of an act of a minor at common law is stated to be its unsusceptibility of ratification.\n\nNo such consequence follows under the laws of Spain. If a sale, for instance, of a minor's real property be absolutely null for the\nwant of indispensable legal solemnities, it may, nevertheless, be either expressly or tacitly ratified. Whether the act be prima\nfacie good, the sale having been attended with all legal formalities, yet subject to avoidance on the ground of lesion, or whether\nit be absolutely null for the want of any of these formalities, is immaterial. In either case it becomes valid by the assent and\napprobation of the minor after attaining *86 adult age. (10 Mart. R., 276; Febrero, vol. 5, pp. 379-80.) The reason of the rule\nis very satisfactory. The privilege for avoiding for lesion, or of considering the contract void when nullities have intervened, is\nin either and in both cases for the benefit of the minor. His interests are consulted. The rule is designed for his protection, and\nconsequently he may waive or renounce his privilege when he deems it advantageous to his interest. (Febrero, vol. 5, p. 378.) It\nis a general principle of the Spanish law that any person who has the capacity to dispose of his property by contract, will, &c.,\nmay by his voluntary act renounce a present or future right. (Febrero, vol. 2, p. 248.) There are some exceptions to this rule; as,\nfor instance, the right to a future succession cannot be alienated, as this might induce schemes to compass the death of the present\nowner and affect the free exercise of his testamentary power. But, as a necessary result of the capacity conferred by law, a party\nmay renounce the privileges consequent upon the nullity of contracts or sales made by him during infancy. There are nullities,\nhowever, which cannot be cured by ratification, as in the instances above cited, or where the stipulations are in derogation of\ngood morals or public order or policy; but nullities for the benefit of individuals may be renounced and the contracts validated\nby their express or tacit confirmation. (3 Annual R., 328; Meares v. Robinson and Wife, decided at this term.)\n\nThese observations are made that there may be no misapprehension as to the force or precise meaning of the terms “void” or\n“null,” when used with reference to the acts of minors as affected by the laws of Spain, and the modification of that meaning\nwhen employed with reference to their acts under the common law.\n\nNotwithstanding the many attempts of the bench, the profession, and jurists to elucidate the subject, yet the questions as to what\nacts of minors shall be regarded as void and what voidable, and what the criterions by which the precise character of their acts\nshall be determined, remain involved in doubt and difficulty. *87 Some of their contracts, as for instance, for necessaries, are\nvalid, and consequently binding on both parties. So far everything is clear. There is no doubt about the standard of validity. But\nwhen these confines are passed, confusion, uncertainty, and conflict of opinion begin to prevail, and we are left in doubt, not\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1852)\n\n\nonly as to what acts shall be regarded void and what voidable, but as to the grounds or tests by which they shall be adjudged\nthe one or the other.\n\nThe tendency of decisions, for a century at least, has been for the extension of the rule that the acts of infants shall be deemed\nvoidable only, and subject to their election either to affirm or disallow them. (2 Kent's Comm., 193.) Where a deed has been\ndelivered, its character of voidability has by some been placed on the ground of the solemnity of the instrument, and by others\nthat there is a semblance of benefit to the infant from the matter of the deed upon the face of it. In Zouch v. Parsons, 3 Burr,\n1794, these points were discussed, and though this case has been questioned as authority in England, yet its doctrines have\nbeen sanctioned in the various courts of the United States, and have received a more liberal extension in their decisions on the\nsubject-matter. In that case, in relation to the effect of the solemity of the instrument, the following rule from Perkins was cited\nwith approbation: “All such gifts, grants, or deeds made by infants, which do not take effect by delivery of his hand, are void;\nbut all gifts, grants, or deeds made by matter in deed, or in writing, which do take effect by delivery of his hand, are voidable\nby himself, his heirs, and by those who have his estate.” And the court says that the words “which take effect” are an essential\npart of the definition, and exclude letters of attorney or deeds which delegate a mere power and convey no interest; that there\nwas no difference between a feoffment and deeds which convey an interest, for the reason that the delivery of the deed must\nbe in the presence of the witnesses as much as the living assignee; the ceremony is as solemn; the presumption that the witness\nwould not attest, if they saw in him an infant, applies equally to both. *88 “Powers of attorney are an exception to the general\nrule that the deeds of infants are only voidable, and a power to receive seizure is an exception to that. The end of the privilege\nis to protect infants, and to that object all the rules and their exceptions must be directed.” But be the point as to the solemnity\nof the delivery as it may, (and there were respectable sayings the other way,) the court held that it was not necessary to their\ndetermination, for they were all of opinion that the consideration received and other circumstances of the transaction showed a\nsemblance of benefit to the infant sufficient to make it voidable only upon the matter of the conveyance.\n\nReeves, in his Treatise on Domestic Relation, expresses the rule in the following terms: “Purchases by an infant are voidable.\nConveyances are voidable only when they take effect by delivery; but if the infant's privilege will not be sufficiently protected\nby considering them as voidable, they are void. Executory contracts are all voidable only. There is no contract executed or\nexecutory but what is voidable only if the contract has taken effect by delivery, excepting cases of delegated powers.” (P. 254.)\n\nThis last position is questioned in 14 Mass., 462, and it was said that “no satisfactory reason can be assigned for the position\nthat a power of attorney, executed by an infant, was absolutely void, and that, perhaps, it might be assumed as a principle that\nall simple contracts by infants which are not founded on an illegal consideration are, strictly, not void, but only voidable. They\nremain a legal substratum for future assent, until avoided by the infant; and if, instead of avoiding, he confirm them when he\nhas a legal capacity to make a contract, they are, in all respects, like contracts by adults.”\n\nThe justness of the views presented in this opinion is very striking, and they apply with special force to the condition of property\nin this State. The lands of individuals are frequently situate in counties remote from each other and from the residence of the\nowner.\n\nIt is a matter of great convenience, if not of absolute necessity, *89 that sales should be effected by agents, and it seems quite\npreposterous that a sale by a minor, which must necessarily or may most conveniently be made through the intervention of an\nattorney in fact, should be void, but if made by himself would only be voidable. His infancy, instead of operating beneficially,\nwould, under such circumstances, be perverted to his injury. If the act be void, it is not binding on others; and if the property\ndepreciate after the sale, it might be thrown back upon his hands, and his infancy would then be turned against him, and, instead\nof shielding himself, would protect others.\n\nIt is impracticable, under the circumstances, to review all or many of the decisions on the question now under discussion. The\nsubject is still involved in obscurity. The test of the character of the act, as dependent upon manual delivery of the deed, has\nvery little foundation in reason. It can afford but a very flimsey protection, which is the object of the rule; and it is repudiated by\nBingham in his admirable treatise on Infancy, p. 10; and he refers to an instance of an act by an infant which does not take effect\nby delivery of his hand, but which is not void; and that is the case of a parol lease for years. Upon this the infant can recover\nfor rent in arrear, which he could not do if the act were void; and further, that this criterion comprehends only gifts, grants,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1852)\n\n\nand deeds, and is not sufficiently extensive for general application. The remaining test, that there must be some semblance of\nbenefit to an infant, is apparently better adapted to the protection of the infant, and is better supported by the authorities.\n\nThe rule is expressed by Chief Justice Eyre, in Keane v. Boycott, (2 H. Bl. R.,) in the following terms: “When the court can\npronounce the contract to be to the infant's prejudice, it is void; and when to his benefit, as for necessaries, it is good; and when\nthe contract is of an uncertain nature, as to benefit or prejudice, it is voidable only, at the election of the infant.”\n\nThis is something better than the test arising from the solemnity *90 of the instrument. But there may be contracts which a\ncourt may deem prejudicial to the infant, but which he, for good reasons, may know to be otherwise. And in such case, if the act\nbe void, its benefits cannot be made available at his election. It is not binding on the other party, and he may refuse compliance\nwith its obligations. Perhaps it would be more consonant with sound policy to hold that none of the acts of an infant should be\ndeemed void on the mere technical ground of infancy alone, but that they should be held binding on others, and voidable at the\nelection of the infant, unless they be such as by the policy of the law are deemed and held to be valid.\n\nThis is apart from cases where actual fraud exists or advantage is taken of the minor's imbecility. In all such the contracts\nwould be void; and so they would be where the consideration was illegal, or against public policy, or incompatible with the\nconfidential relations existing between the minor and others.\n\nOn examination of the authorities, and with due regard to the object to be attained by the privilege of the infant, viz, his\nprotection, we are justified in concluding that any delivery of a deed or thing granted, which, if done by an adult, would pass the\ntitle, will, if done by an infant, render it voidable but not void; and that if the semblance of benefit be regarded as a criterion, the\nmore rational and consistent rule would be that the act should not be deemed void unless it was one of those which, as a general\nprinciple, it would be better for the infant that they should be deemed void than voidable. As to what contracts of infants are\nvoid and what voidable, see 4 Day R., 59; 6 Conn. R., 494; 1 Hayw. R., 143; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Gill</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">& Johns. R., 314; 1 J. J.

R., 119.\n\nIt is very clear, then, that this deed, having been delivered as deeds usually are delivered by adults, and having also a semblence\nof benefit on the face of it to the infant, must be *91 regarded as not void, but only voidable; and the question then arises\nwhether it can be avoided, by guardian or by themselves, before their attaining full age.\n\nUpon principle it would seem that if an act of an infant be only voidable and be binding upon the other party until it is avoided,\nthat the act of disaffirmance must be by the infant himself on attaining mature age. That it can be avoided at all is owing to\nthe want of legal discretion in the infant at the time of its execution; and this continues during his nonage, and renders his\naffirmance or disaffirmance before majority of no avail.\n\nIn Oliver & Clapp v. Howdlet, (13 Mass. R., 237,) it was said by the court that they knew of no position of law which gave\nthe guardian of the minor authority to disaffirm purchases made by the minors; that the sales had the semblance of benefit\nto the vendees, and that the authority of guardians extending only to such things as may be for the benefit and advantage of\ntheir wards, they could not avoid contracts from which they derive benefit, for this, being injurious to the infant, would be a\nviolation of the guardian's duty.\n\nThe question under consideration has been discussed and elaborately investigated in the courts of New York.\n\nIn Roof v. Stafford, (7 Cowen, 179,) which was an action of trover brought for the recovery of a horse sold by a minor, the\nplaintiff suing by guardian, the Supreme Court held that the contract was not voidable until the infant came of age. An extensive\nreview was taken of the authorities in relation to the time at which an infant can avoid a conveyance of his lands. In Zouch v.\nParsons (3 Burr. 1794,) it was said that an infant could not avoid such conveyance until arriving at twenty-one years of age.\nThis is said to follow, because, if it were otherwise, he might also bring a writ analogous to a dum fuit infra œtatem, and so\nconclude his right upon the record.

Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1852)\n\n\n\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court was reversed in the court of errors. (9 Cowen 628.) In the opinion given by the chancellor\nit is said, “the general rule is that an infant cannot avoid his contract executed by himself, and which is therefore voidable only\nwhile he is within age. He lacks legal discretion to do the act of avoidance. But this rule must be taken with the distinction\nthat it shall not work unavoidable prejudice to the infant, or the object of his privilege would not be answered. When applied\nto a sale of his property it must be to his land, a case in which he may enter and receive the profits until the power of finally\navoiding shall arrive.” The true rule was said to be that where the infant can enter and hold the subject of the sale till his legal\nage, he shall be incapable of avoiding till that time; but where the possession is changed, and there are no legal means to hold\nand regain it in the meantime, the infant, or his guardian for him, has the right to exercise the power of rescission immediately;\nthat the common law gave no action or other means by which the mere possession of personal property could be reclaimed\nand held subject to the right of avoidance.\n\nThe sum of the doctrines held by both courts in this case in relation to conveyances of lands by a minor is, that they cannot be\navoided until after the minor arrives at full age, though he may enter and take the profits in the meantime, but that the sale and\ndelivery of chattels by a minor may be avoided while under age.\n\nThe whole subject in relation to the character of the acts of infants, and the time and manner in which they may be avoided,\nwas thoroughly canvassed in the case of Bool v. Mix, 17 Wendell, 119, and it was said that the general rules vary; that the act\nin pais of an infant may be avoided by some other act of equal solemnity and notoriety. It may also be avoided by a writ of dum\nfuit infra œtatem; but that it cannot be *93 avoided until the infant becomes of age, though he may enter and take the profits;\nthat some of the old books say that an infant may avoid his deed by entry before he becomes of age, but such is not the doctrine\nof the present day. He may enter and take the profits until he has the legal capacity to affirm or disaffirm the deed, but the deed\nis not rendered void by the entry; it may still be confirmed after he arrives at full age.\n\nNo case has been cited in which an infant has, by himself or guardian, attempted, while within age, to recover lands passed from\nhim by an executed conveyance, and it is probable that none such can be shown; otherwise it would, doubtless, have been cited\nin support of the plaintiffs. It is very doubtful whether in cases of this character a formal demand, even if the infant had attained\nmajority, should not have been made for possession before the bringing of suit. The deed of the infant was only voidable, and\nuntil avoided the defendant is not a trespasser. His possession is rightful, and it would seem that he should have some notice\nof the intention to disaffirm the contract. But this point is left open.\n\nAnother ground which might have been taken in support of demurrer is this, that there was no offer on the part of the plaintiffs\nto restore the purchase-money which they had received from the defendant Powell on the sale. This is the rule under the laws\nof Spain, (vide Febrero, vol. 5, p. 379) and it has received the sanction of the courts of some of the States, eminent for their\nwisdom and authority. It is characterized by honesty, and enforces rectitude of conduct in transactions between individuals,\nand, as a general rule, it will be recognized and enforced by this court. See Reeve's Dom. Rela., 243-249; 15 Mass. R., 359; 1\nN. H. R., 73-75; 5 Sergt. & Rawle's R., 309, 313; 7 Cow. R., 183.\n\nWe are of opinion that there is no error in the judgment, and it is ordered that the same be affirmed.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nNOTE 19.--Kilgore v. Jordan, 17 T., 341; Stuart v.

In three issues, West asserts that the district court erred by granting *515 the temporary injunction\nbecause the State did not demonstrate (1) a probable right to recovery or (2) a probable injury, and (3) the order did not\nspecifically state the reasons for its issuance. Because we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm the\nsupplemental temporary injunction order.\n\n\n\n                                                         BACKGROUND\n\nAt the supplemental temporary injunction hearing, the court admitted evidence of a printed copy of West's Web site, testimony\nfrom an investigator employed by the Consumer Protection and Public Health Division of the Texas Attorney General's office,\nand documents from Hibernia National Bank in Baton Rouge provided in response to the State's civil investigative demand. The\ninvestigator's testimony and the Web site evidence revealed that West used an Austin radio commercial, a recorded telephone\nmessage (identified as a “phone overview”), and a Web site to advertise meetings at a local hotel about a “banking opportunity”\nthat would allow any “U.S. Citizen” to pay off all personal debt—including “credit cards, mortgages, student loans, vehicles,\nloans, IRS settlements, and back child support”—before December 31, 2005, by securing a “loan” from an unnamed bank.\nWest's “www.bankopp.com ” Web site also stated that “David [West] found a Bank that is willing to give individuals loans to\npay off their debts. Then the Bank is willing to turn around and forgive that loan so it doesn't have to be paid off.” It asserted that\n“two little known banking practices ... Fractional Banking and Forgiven Loans” made this “one shot opportunity” possible. The\nsite claimed that although “this opportunity is legal,” the “Federal Reserve will undoubtedly close the loopholes that allowed the\nproject to take place this once. While the system intended on well connected, wealthy individuals to be able to take advantage\nof this, it was never intended that regular every day people would gain access to it.”\n\nThe site further claimed that the unnamed bank had agreed to pay off $100 million in debt and that “[the] project is about David\n[West]'s looking for others to add their debt to the pile David started.” The idea was to accumulate $100 million in debt for\nthe bank to “fractionalize then forgive” so that “the bank can make money and the folks with David can get out of debt.” The\nsite claimed that, after “David told his 10 closest friends about the project,” word spread quickly throughout Louisiana and\nMississippi. The site also explained that West accelerated its marketing of the project following Hurricane Katrina:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These Open Meetings will have hundreds of people in attendance and are expected to\n             help reach[ ] the goal of $100 Million in debt before Thanksgiving. This would leave plenty of time for\n             the bank to pay before December 31st (the bank only needs 10 business days).\n\n\nAs a signal of their “commitment to be involved with the project,” the site asked participants to deposit a wire transfer of\n$5,000 to a bank account in Panama, or to the “Del Sur International Holdings” account with Hibernia National Bank in Baton\nRouge. According to the site, after the money was submitted, the bank would perform a financial analysis and might contact\nthe participant to discuss any issues: “[T]he bank will analyze each project member's debt and provide feedback if there are\nconcerns.” Also after wiring their $5,000 “commitment/deposit money,” the site stated that participants would receive *516\na document “guarantee[ing] that the loan that [they] are signing will be forgiven and that [they] will not have to pay it back!”\nVisitors to the Web site were not informed that the Del Sur International Holdings account, to which the $5,000 wire transfers\nwere directed, was the sole proprietorship of David West.\n\nThe State filed suit under the Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §§\n17.46(a)-(b), .47 (West Supp.2005) ( “DTPA”) against David West, Roxana Suadi West, 1 Carlos M. Suadi, and Pydia, Inc. d/b/\na www.bankopp.com, seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief based on the debt elimination “service for sale to consumers.”\nThe State obtained a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction against West, preventing any further marketing in\nTexas of the “banking opportunity.” 2\n\nAfter learning that David West attempted to withdraw all funds from the Baton Rouge account to which the participants' $5,000\nwire transfers had been directed, 3 the State obtained a supplemental restraining order, freezing the funds in the Hibernia\nbank account. The State also sought to convert the supplemental restraining order into a supplemental temporary injunction,\nmaintaining the freeze on the account. Following a hearing on October 25, 2005, the district court entered an order preventing\nDavid West, Roxana Suadi West, Carlos M. Suadi, and Pydia, Inc. d/b/a www.bankopp.com from accessing the Hibernia bank\naccount.\n\nSpecifically, the order enjoined them (and those associated with them) from\n\n  • transferring, spending, hypothecating, concealing, encumbering, withdrawing, removing or allowing the transfer, removal,\n     or withdrawal of any funds from Account # [ ], held at Hibernia National Bank; and\n\n  • transferring, spending, hypothecating, concealing, encumbering, withdrawing, removing or allowing the transfer, removal,\n     or withdrawal of any funds from any other financial institution and/or account into which Defendants have placed or caused\n     to be placed, funds from consumers to participate in Defendants' “bank opportunity.”\n\nThe order also set the case for trial.\n\nWest appeals only from the district court's October 25 supplemental temporary injunction order that froze the assets in the\nHibernia bank account. It asserts that the district court abused its discretion by entering the supplemental temporary injunction\nbecause the State did not demonstrate (1) a probable right to recovery or (2) a probable injury, and (3) the order did not\nspecifically state the reasons for its issuance.

The trial court does not abuse its discretion if some evidence reasonably\nsupports its decision. Id. at 211.\n\n\nProbable right to recovery\n [4] In its first issue, West argues that the district court erred in granting the temporary injunction because the State did not\ndemonstrate a probable right to recovery. West asserts that the transaction at issue is a loan of money, which is neither a “good”\nnor a “service” under the DTPA. See Riverside Nat'l Bank v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1624043\"><a href=\"/opinion/1624043/riverside-nat-bank-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (Tex.1980); see also Tex. Bus.\n& Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(1), (2) (West 2002). West argues that the DTPA applies to transactions in which the borrower's\nobjective is to purchase or lease goods or services, but the DTPA is inapplicable if a borrower's objective is merely an attempt\nto acquire money. See La Sara Grain Co. v. First Nat'l Bank of Mercedes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455879\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455879/la-sara-grain-v-first-nat-bank-of-mercedes/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566–67 (Tex.1984); Megason v.\nRed River Employees Fed.

Cf.\nTex. Fin.Code Ann. § 301.002(a)(10) (West Supp.2005) (defining “loan” as “an advance of money that is made to or on behalf\nof an obligor, the principal amount of which the obligor has an obligation to pay the creditor”). Alternatively, the State argues\nthat West is offering a loan forgiveness service.\n\nThe district court's finding of a probable right to recovery under the DTPA is supported by the evidence that West's Web site,\noffers a service—specifically, the elimination of debt—in exchange for $5,000. According to the site, after the money was\nsubmitted, “the bank [would] analyze each project member's debt and provide feedback if there are concerns.” The site also\ninformed the public that, after wiring $5,000, participants would receive a document “guarantee [ing] that the loan that [they]\nare signing will be forgiven and that [they] will not have to pay it back!”\n\n“Services” are defined in the DTPA as “work, labor, or service purchased or leased for use, including services furnished in\nconnection with the sale or repair of goods.” Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(2). The State's suit complains that West's\nservice violates the DTPA because it (1) fails to disclose the factual basis for its representations that David West has found a\nbank willing to give individuals “loans” to pay their debts without expectation of repayment and (2) encourages consumers to\nwire $5,000 to an account that is not identified as belonging to David West.\n\nThe debt elimination opportunity that West offered is similar to the function of a “credit services organization,” defined in the\nfinance code as\n\n  a person who provides, or represents that the person can or will provide, for the payment of valuable consideration, any of\n  the following services with respect to the extension of consumer credit by others:\n\n  (A) improving a consumer's credit history or rating;\n\n  (B) obtaining an extension of consumer credit for a consumer; or\n\n   *518 (C) providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to Paragraph (A) or (B).\n\nTex.

(holding that when\nlegislature authorized attorney general to seek injunctions on behalf of multiple consumers, it determined that past or threatened\nDTPA violation coupled with public need constituted sufficient “irreparable risk of harm” to support entry of injunction).\n\n [6] Accordingly, the State argues that, to be entitled to a temporary injunction under the DTPA, it need only demonstrate to\nthe court its reason to believe that (1) any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in any act or practice\ndeclared to be unlawful by the DTPA, and (2) that proceedings would be in the public interest. See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code\nAnn. § 17.47(a). The fact that a person has ceased its unlawful conduct will not affect the State's entitlement to injunctive relief.\nId. Furthermore, the DTPA authorizes the court to “make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary to compensate\nidentifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by\nmeans of any unlawful act or practice.” Id. § 17.47(d) (emphasis added).\n\nAt the October 25 hearing on the supplemental temporary injunction, the State introduced evidence of West's\n“www.bankopp.com ” Web site, promoting a “banking opportunity” that would allow any “U.S. Citizen” to pay off all personal\ndebt—including “credit cards, mortgages, student loans, vehicles, loans, IRS settlements, and back child support”—before\nDecember 31, 2005, by securing a “loan” from an unnamed bank. The site contained repeated assertions that participants will not\nrepay the bank because the “loans” will be forgiven. It claimed that “two little known banking practices ... Fractional Banking\nand Forgiven Loans” made this “one shot opportunity” possible. The site also claimed that although “this opportunity is legal,”\nthe “Federal Reserve will undoubtedly close the loopholes that allowed the project to take place this once. While the system\nintended on well connected, wealthy individuals to be able to take advantage of this, it was never intended that regular every\nday people would gain access to it.” The site also asked participants to deposit a wire transfer of $5,000—as a signal of their\n“commitment *520 to be involved with the project”—to a bank account in Panama, or to an account with Hibernia National\nBank in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe State also introduced into evidence documents that the Hibernia National Bank in Baton Rouge, Louisiana provided in\nresponse to the State's civil investigative demand. The documents included a commercial new account information card for\nDel Sur International Holdings and its “sole proprietorship resolution certificate,” along with a copy of a Louisiana driver's\nlicense issued to David Jason West. These documents show that David West opened a free small business checking account\nwith $100 cash at Hibernia on August 8, 2005, under the business name of Del Sur International Holdings. He is the sole owner\nand signatory on the account. The account number assigned to the Del Sur International Holdings checking account matches\nthe account number on the Web site to which the participants' $5,000 wire transfers had been directed. The Web site does not\ndisclose that the $5,000 transfers of participants' “commitment money” were deposited into an account owned by David West.\n\nBased on this evidence, the district court determined that West “may be violating the DTPA” and that the State's action “was\nin the public interest.” Indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the court's order as we must, we conclude that there is\nsufficient evidence to support the court's findings in accordance with section 17.47(a). Thus, we overrule West's second issue.\n\n\nSpecificity of order under rule 683\n [7] [8] In its third issue, West claims that the district court's temporary injunction violated rule 683 because it did not state\nthe reasons for its order with specificity. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 683. West argues that the district court's order does not specifically\nstate the reasons why injury will be suffered if the interlocutory relief is not ordered. West also faults the order for its failure to\nstate why the identified probable injury is an irreparable one for which the State has no adequate legal remedy.

Because we conclude that the order was sufficiently specific under rule\n683, we need not address the waiver issue. 4\n\n *521 Relying on rule 693, the State responds that “the principles, practice and procedure governing courts of equity shall\ngovern proceedings in injunctions when the same are not in conflict with these rules or the provisions of the statutes.” Tex.R.\nCiv. P. 693 (emphasis added); see also Texas Pet Foods, Inc., 591 S.W.2d at 805 (“When it is determined that the statute is\nbeing violated, it is within the province of the district court to restrain it .... [t]he doctrine of balancing the equities has no\napplication to this statutorily authorized injunctive relief.”).\n\nThe State reiterates that section 17.47(a) of the DTPA authorizes the State's consumer protection division to bring an action\nfor injunctive relief when “it has reason to believe that any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in\nany act or practice declared to be unlawful by [the DTPA], and that proceedings would be in the public interest.” Tex. Bus. &\nCom.Code Ann. § 17.47(a). The DTPA also authorizes the court to “make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary\nto compensate identifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been\nacquired by means of any unlawful act or practice.” Id. § 17.47(d). The State contends that the order is proper because it contains\nthe essential findings that “Defendants may be violating § 17.47(a) and (b) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer\nProtection Act,” and that “this action is in the public interest.”\n\nThe court found that the freeze was necessary to prevent West from dissipating funds in the account to which the participants'\nwire transfers had been directed:\n\n            [U]nless Defendants are immediately restrained from the acts prohibited below, Defendants will dissipate\n            funds obtained from consumers through misrepresentations in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices\n            Act, before a full trial can be held on the merits of the State's claims. To the extent required by law,\n            Plaintiff [State] has proved that continued violation of these laws will continue to cause Plaintiff and the\n            general public to suffer irreparable harm.\n\nWe conclude that this order complied with the statutory prerequisites under section 17.47(a) of the DTPA by finding that\n“Defendants may be violating § 17.47(a) and (b) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer Protection Act,” and that\n“this action is in the public interest.” The order also satisfied the specificity requirement of rule 683 by finding that, “unless\nDefendants are immediately restrained *522 from the acts prohibited below, Defendants will dissipate funds obtained from\nconsumers through misrepresentations in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, before a full trial can be held on the\nmerits of the State's claims.” Accordingly, we overrule West's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It was instituted by Betty L. Deen, relator, against F. Edgar Deen, Jr., and the\nHonorable Stanley C. Kirk, Judge of the 78th Judicial District of Wichita County, to require the latter to expunge an order\npurporting to set aside a divorce judgment previously rendered by him. We agree with relator that the judgment in question had\nbecome final and that Judge Kirk had no power to set it aside as he attempted to do. In accordance with our usual procedure\nin cases of this nature, the writ of mandamus will be granted conditionally.\n\nOn June 22, 1973, F. Edgar Deen, Jr., hereinafter referred to as respondent, instituted suit for divorce against relator in Cause\nNo. 94,536—B in the 78th District Court of Wichita County. At the same time he filed a waiver of citation previously executed\nby relator. The jurat on the waiver is dated June 21, 1973. On August 22, 1973, without further notice, citation or waiver, Judge\nKirk rendered judgment granting respondent a divorce and approving an undescribed property settlement agreement. Relator\nfirst learned of these proceedings on October 27, 1973.\n\nOn November 30, 1973, relator filed suit for divorce against respondent in the Domestic Relations Court No. 4 of Tarrant County.\nTemporary injunctions were issued in that suit, and both parties were ordered *71 to file written inventories. Apparently no\nfurther action has been taken in that case, which is still pending in the trial court. It has no bearing on our disposition of this\nmandamus proceeding.\n\nOn December 3, 1973, relator filed in Cause No. 95,544—B in the 78th District Court of Wichita County a petition in the\nnature of a bill of review, praying that the judgment in Cause No. 94,536—B be set aside. On December 13, 1973, Judge Kirk\non his own motion entered an order in Cause No. 94,536—B setting aside the judgment previously rendered in that case. A\nfew days later relator was served with citation in the original divorce case. Respondent then filed in Cause No. 95,544—B a\nmotion to dismiss, alleging that since the judgment in Cause No. 94,536—B had been set aside, the bill of review proceeding\nwas moot. On January 3, 1974, the motion was granted and the bill of review proceeding was dismissed. The original divorce\ncase was also set for trial on the merits.\n\nIt is our understanding that relator appealed the judgment of dismissal in Cause No. 95,544—B to the Court of Civil Appeals.\nSo far as we know, she did not attempt to carry the original divorce judgment in Cause No. 94,536—B to the Court of Civil\nAppeals by writ of error. In the present proceeding she seeks a writ of mandamus to require Judge Kirk to set aside the order\nof December 13, 1973, whereby he attempted to give her the relief she sought by her petition for a bill of review.\n [1] Under the provisions of Rule 119, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant may waive the issuance and service of\ncitation by filing among the papers of the cause a verified written memorandum ‘signed by him, or by his duly authorized agent\nor attorney, after suit is brought.’ Article 2224, Vernon's Ann.Civ.St., prohibits the waiver of process by an instrument executed\nprior to institution of suit. It is clear then that the waiver executed by relator prior to institution of the divorce suit in Wichita\nCounty did not subject her to the jurisdiction of the court. McAnelly v.

There are Texas decisions that support this\nposition, and respondents cite a number of them. See, for example, Harrison v. Whiteley, Tex.Com.App., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where\nit was held that a judgment was void and could be vacated at a subsequent term of court because the lack of jurisdiction over\nthe defendant affirmatively appeared in the ‘judgment roll’, i.e. from the citation on file among the papers in the case.\n\nThe present case is governed by the following provisions of Rule 329b, T.R.C.P.:\n          5. Judgments shall become final after the expiration of thirty (30) days after the date of rendition of judgment\n          or order overruling an original or amended motion for new trial.

Harrison, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1625965\"><a href=\"/opinion/1625965/mcewen-v-harrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where it was pointed out\nthat the meaning and effect of the two sentences could not be determined from either: (1) decisions in cases tried in district courts\nwhose proceedings were not governed by the Special Practice Act passed by the Legislature in 1923 1 and its amendments and\nextensions or by Rule 330(l), T.R.C.P., as it existed prior to 1955, or (2) decisions in cases tried in county courts before January\n1, 1961. We also *72 observed that the case of Harrison v. Whiteley, Tex.Com.App., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is in the latter category.\n\nThe opinion in McEwen recognizes that a bill of review might not be an appropriate method for attacking in the trial court,\nmore than thirty days after the rendition of judgment or order overruling motion for new trial, a judgment in a case which the\ncourt was without jurisdictional power to hear and adjudicate. The words ‘jurisdictional power’ as used in that opinion mean\njurisdiction over the subject matter, the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the particular one\nbelongs. We were not speaking of jurisdiction over the parties. The examples given were the rendition by a county court of\njudgment for divorce or for title to land. In each instance the court would have been utterly without power to render an effective\njudgment on the merits of the controversy.\n\nThe quoted provisions of Rule 329b were construed in McEwen as follows:\n           Accordingly, we construe the emphasized provision of Rule 329—b to mean that when the time for filing\n           a motion for new trial has expired and relief may not be obtained by appeal, a proceeding in the nature of a\n           bill of review is the exclusive method of vacating a default judgment rendered in a case in which the court\n           had jurisdictional power to render it. Into this category will fall those cases in which a default judgment is\n           asserted to be void for want of service, or of valid service, of process. This is in harmony with our holding\n           in Brown v. Clippenger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3907129\"><a href=\"/opinion/4143629/brown-v-clippinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3907129\"><a href=\"/opinion/4143629/brown-v-clippinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. With this construction of the Rule, we may assume,\n           without deciding, that Texaco is correct when it says that the default judgment against it is a void judgment\n           and that its motion to vacate is a direct attack on the judgment. We are yet compelled to hold that the order\n           vacating the default judgment is unauthorized and void because the district court had jurisdictional power to\n           determine the validity of service (Indeed, it was its duty to do so) and to render the judgment, and Texaco's\n           motion to vacate it does not qualify as a bill of review. (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n [2] Paraphrasing the italicized portion of the opinion just quoted, the 78th District Court of Wichita County had jurisdictional\npower to determine the validity and effectiveness of the waiver and to render a judgment for divorce. Relator's petition for a\nbill of review was never heard but was dismissed. In these circumstances and under the provisions of Rule 329b, the order\nof December 13, 1973, purporting to set aside the divorce judgment previously rendered in Cause No. 94,536—B is void and\nshould itself be set aside. We are not to be understood as saying that a bill of review was the only effective remedy available to\nrelator when she learned of the divorce judgment. See Art. 2255, V.A.C.S.; Whitney v. L & L Realty Corp., Tex., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2393387\"><a href=\"/opinion/2393387/whitney-v-l-l-realty-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Flynt v.

It was, however, the only remedy then available to her in the\ntrial court.\n\n\nWe assume that Judge Kirk will set aside his order of December 13, 1973, promptly after our judgment in this proceeding\nbecomes final. In the event he fails to do so, a writ of mandamus will issue.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Acts 1923, 38th Leg., ch. 105, p. 215, s 1, later codified as Art. 2002, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. 1925.\n\n\n End of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We find no merit in\neither of these points and overrule same.\n [1] While appellant's points are preserved in an unverified motion for new trial, we find no statement of facts in this record\nwhich would reveal testimony introduced in support of the motion for new trial. Accordingly, the judgment, above recited,\nstands unchallenged and each finding recited therein is presumed to be true.\n\n [2] A casual reference to the judgment clearly demonstrates that it is sufficient to meet every requirement of Rule 11, T.R.C.P.,\nrelied upon by appellant. The recitations contained in the judgment are clear and explicit and the same was made in open court\nand agreed to by not only the attorneys but by the appellant himself. Thus we find appellant complaining of that to which he\nhas agreed. This, he cannot do in the absence of allegation and proof of fraud, collusion, or some similar reason. As early as\n1853 the Supreme Court of Texas had occasion, speaking through Chief Justice Hemphill, to classically announce the rule in\nsuch cases as follows:\n‘* * * appellants are at once confronted with the general principle that consent takes away error, and that a judgment by\nagreement or compromise cannot be impeached, unless for fraud, collusion, or like causes, none of which appear in this record\nor are alleged or assigned.

TEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE\nANN. § 51.014 (Vernon Supp.1989). In six points of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in dissolving\nthe temporary injunction. We affirm.\n\nReliance Machine Works, Inc. was founded in 1982 by appellant and appellee, Natu Patel. Fifty percent of the stock was issued\nto appellant and the remaining fifty percent was issued to Dhanash Patel, Natu Patel's brother. Appellant and Dhanash Patel\nwere the sole officers of the corporation and the only members of the board of directors. In 1983, the parties entered into an oral\nagreement whereby ownership of Reliance would be transferred to appellant's wife, Minaxi Desai, and appellee, Kokila Patel,\nin order to qualify as a minority (female) owned business for the purposes of securing government contracts. Shortly thereafter,\nfifty-one percent of the stock was transferred to appellee, Kokila Patel, and this is where the dispute begins. Appellees contend\nthat the issuance of an additional one percent of the stock to Kokila Patel was permanent in that it was in exchange for $55,000 of\nunpaid salaries. Appellant asserts that this arrangement was only temporary due to the fact that Minaxi Desai was in India at the\ntime, and that the agreement was that ownership in Reliance would be equalized upon her return. When Minaxi Desai returned\nfrom India, Kokila Patel did not relinquish her majority interest. Appellant contends that appellee, Kokila Patel, fraudulently\nobtained the majority interest in Reliance and has used that interest to the detriment of Reliance and appellant.\n\nIn January 1987, appellant brought a shareholder's derivative suit against appellees and on April 2, 1987, the trial court entered\na temporary injunction order enjoining the appellees from engaging in twenty enumerated acts. The temporary injunction order\ndid not include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits. On March 21, 1990, the trial court dissolved the temporary\ninjunction upon a finding that a material and substantial change in circumstances and conditions had occurred since the issuance\nof the temporary injunction, and appellant appealed. On appellant's motion, this court entered a temporary order, pursuant to\nTEX.R.APP.P. 43(c), continuing the injunction pending disposition of this appeal.\n\n [1] By way of a counterpoint, appellees assert that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dissolving the temporary\ninjunction because the original temporary injunction order did not comply with TEX.R.CIV.P. 683. Rule 683 provides, in\npertinent part, that:\n\n             Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits\n             with respect to the ultimate relief sought.\n\nTEX.R.CIV.P. 683. The trial court's April 2, 1987 order granting the temporary injunction did not include an order setting the\ncause for trial on the merits. We agree that had appellees appealed from the original order, the temporary injunction should have\nbeen dissolved. E.g., Interfirst Bank San Felipe N.A. v. Paz Construction Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523599\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523599/interfirst-bank-san-felipe-v-paz-const-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1986). However, appellees\ndid not perfect an appeal from the initial order, and the time limit for doing so has long since expired. See TEX.R.APP.P.\n42(a).

Appellees' counterpoint is overruled.\n\n [2] [3] The decision to dissolve a temporary injunction is a matter lying within the broad discretion of the trial court.\nOur review of the trial court's order of dissolution *642 is limited to the narrow question of whether the trial court's action\nconstituted a clear abuse of discretion. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 834; State v. Friedmann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774286\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774286/state-v-friedmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Corpus Christi 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The trial court has the authority to dissolve a temporary injunction upon a showing of\nchanged conditions. See, e.g., Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835–36. Here, appellees' motion to dissolve alleged that, since the issuance\nof the temporary injunction, appellees had been effectively excluded from any participation in the operations and management of\nReliance. After three days of testimony in a contested hearing, the trial court dissolved the injunction upon a finding of material\nand substantial changes in circumstances and conditions since the issuance of the temporary injunction on April 2, 1987.\n\n [4] Appellant's first point of error asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in dissolving the temporary injunction because\nthere was no change in circumstances that altered the status quo that existed at the time the temporary injunction was granted.\nWe cannot agree. The trial court heard testimony that numerous changes in Reliance had occurred since the issuance of the\ntemporary injunction. These changes were made at the direction of appellant and without the participation of Kokila Patel, the\nmajority shareholder and member of Reliance's board of directors.\n\nAppellees introduced testimony at the hearing to show that appellant had relocated Reliance to a larger facility. The testimony\nindicated that the new site was environmentally contaminated by leaking gasoline tanks. The relocation of the business was\na part of appellant's course of expansion which would include increased numbers of employees and equipment. In relocating\nthe company, appellant entered into a new lease agreement which called for increased monthly rent and insurance costs.\nFurthermore, Reliance's new landlord would become a business entity operated by members of appellant's family. Whether\nthese changes were beneficial to Reliance or not, they were completed without the knowledge or participation of Kokila Patel.\nFurther testimony revealed that Kokila Patel had even been barred admittance to Reliance's facilities.\n\nWhen the temporary injunction was issued, Kokila Patel was in possession of 51% of the outstanding stock in Reliance. The\ndispute in the underlying case involves the ownership of the 1% controlling interest. Rather than curtail Kokila Patel's alleged\nabuse of that controlling interest, ample testimony was introduced to show that, since the issuance of the temporary injunction,\nKokila Patel has been deprived of any participation in the management, operation, and benefits of Reliance. Under these\ncircumstances, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dissolving the temporary injunction. The first point\nof error is overruled.\n\nIn his second point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it dissolved the temporary injunction\nbecause the dissolution imperils his rights. In support of this contention appellant relies on the holding in Lone Star Mining Co.\nv. Texeramics, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Civ.App.—Eastland 1960, writ ref'd n.r.e.). In Lone Star, the court held that “[w]here\nit appears that a continuation of a temporary injunction cannot imperil the rights of the adverse party, but its dissolution may\nseriously jeopardize the rights of the complaining party, the temporary injunction should be continued in force.” Id. at 874. As\nour prior discussion reflects, the trial court was presented with ample evidence tending to show that the continuation of the\ntemporary injunction would imperil the rights of the appellees. Therefore, appellant's contention is without merit. We overrule\nthe second point of error.\n\nAppellant's third point of error asserts that even if changed circumstances existed, the trial court abused its discretion by\ndissolving the temporary injunction rather than modifying it to order that Kokila Patel be consulted in future management\ndecisions. Appellant cites no authority in support of this contention. However, based upon our review of the record before us,\n *643 and our discussion relating to appellant's first point of error, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\ndissolving the temporary injunction rather than modifying it to reflect that Kokila Patel be consulted in future management\ndecisions. Appellant's third point of error is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It should have been the first entry, and a copy should have been transmitted with the\ntranscript. The judgment which we are invoked to revise and reverse was entered by consent. It commences with the recital that\nthe “case coming on to be heard upon the mandate from the Supreme Court, the parties appeared by their attorneys and agreed\nto the following decree to be entered as the judgment of this court,” &c., &c. This agreement was made by the attorneys of\nthe parties; but no objection is taken to the judgment on that ground. It is not assigned or contended that their authority should\nhave appeared of record. No question is raised as to their power. That they had competent authority must be presumed until it\nis impugned and the contrary shown, and the judgment must be taken as having been agreed to by the parties themselves; under\nthis aspect the appellants are at once confronted with the general principle that consent takes away error, and that a judgment by\nagreement or compromise cannot be impeached, unless for fraud, collusion, or like causes, none of which appear in this record\nor are alleged or assigned. (Story v. Hawkins et al., 8 Da. R., 12; French v. Hotwell, 5 Johns. Chan. R., 555; 14 Ves. R., 31.)\n\nThe appellants are concluded by their own consent, and their appeal cannot be sustained.\n\nBut if the decree had not been entered by consent there does not appear any such substantial error prejudicial to the appellants\nas would have authorized a reversal.\n\nThe mandate of the Supreme Court required the rights of Mrs. Hartwell, under the deed of gift, and of her minor children to\na portion of the estate under the law to be respected; and this appears in substance to have been done, in accordance with the\nspirit and intent of the mandate, and without injustice to the other distributees of the estate.\n\nAfter deducting the property or its value embraced in the deed of gift, the surplus was directed to be equally divided *497\nbetween the heirs of the deceased. This has been effected, as to the real estate, by establishing the partition formerly made and\nof record in the County Court; and if execution has been given the widow for the value of her property under the deed of gift,\nand the minor heirs for the value of their shares respectively of the personal property, it arose doubtless from the fact that this\nproperty had been converted by the other parties to their own use.\n\nThe errors assigned are:\n\n1st. In rendering judgment against the heirs, and ordering execution to issue against the same.\n\nThis has been already considered and its futility shown.\n\n2d.

Appellee sells its products in Texas and in other states. Appellants, the State Fire Marshal and his employees, took the\nposition that appellee could not lawfully sell its products in Texas and actively interfered with appellee's efforts to make such\nsales.\n\nAppellee filed a declaratory judgment suit in the district court of Travis County and, ancillary to its declaratory judgment suit,\nsought a temporary injunction. After hearing, the district court temporarily enjoined appellants from (a) “taking any action\nwhatsoever to interfere with the marketing, sale or delivery of Fires Out, Inc. fire extinguishers”; and from (b) “contacting any\nperson for the purpose of stating or representing that fire extinguishers manufactured or sold by Fires Out, Inc. may not legally\nbe sold in Texas.” This Court will affirm the district court's temporary injunctive order.\n\n [1] Appellants attack the district court's order by two points of error. By their first point, appellants assert that the injunctive\norder must be dissolved because the reasons for its issuance are not sufficiently set out as required by Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 683\n(Supp.1987). Rule 683 provides that every order granting an injunction “shall set forth the reasons for its issuance.”\n\nThe only reason set forth in the district court's order is as follows:\n\n             The Court considered the verified pleadings, the evidence, and arguments of counsel, and finds and\n             concludes that the plaintiff has shown and demonstrated its right to a temporary injunction under the law,\n             and the Court further concludes that plaintiff's sale of its fire extinguisher product within the State of\n             Texas is exempted from regulation by the State Fire Marshal under Section 6(d) of Article 5.43–1.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Although appellants filed a “Motion for Reconsideration,” they did not point out to the district court\nany claimed deficiency in the form of the order.\n\nTexas R.App.P.Ann. 52(a) (Supp.1987) provides generally that\n\n            [i]n order to preserve a complaint for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a\n            timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling he desired the court to\n            make.... (Emphasis supplied).\n\nRule 52(a) derives from Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 373 (1985). To preserve error, Rule 373 required a party to make known to the court\nthe desired action and the party's grounds therefor at the time the ruling or order was made or sought. Rule 373 was applied\nto errors committed by the trial court in the entry of judgments. Travis Heights Improvement Ass'n v.

As in the above opinions,\nthere was no claimed error present until the judgment was prepared and presented to the district court. At that time, appellants\ncould have moved to modify or change the terms of the judgment. It serves no good purpose to permit appellants to lie in wait\nand present this error in form for the first time on appeal. On proper request, the district court could easily have added to the\njudgment a description of the specific harm avoided by granting the temporary injunction. Appellants would then have obtained\nproper notice of the district court's reasoning and appellate review would have been facilitated.\n\nAlthough appellants did request the district court to reconsider the order, appellants did not raise the facial inadequacy of\nthe order. Accordingly, appellants' motion did not preserve the error. See, e.g., State v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1731699\"><a href=\"/opinion/1731699/state-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800–01\n(Tex.Civ.App.1962, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see also Tex.R.App.P. 52(a) (objection must state “specific grounds”).\n\n [2] [3] [4] By their second point of error, appellants complain that the district court abused its discretion in granting the\ninjunctive order because appellee did not demonstrate a probable right to recovery. In a hearing on an application for a temporary\ninjunction, the only question before the trial court is the appellant's right to the preservation of the status quo of the subject\nmatter of the suit, pending a final trial on the merits. To warrant the issuance of a temporary injunction, the applicant need only\nshow a probable right and a probable injury; he is not required to establish that he will finally prevail in the litigation. The trial\ncourt is clothed with broad discretion in determining whether the pleadings and evidence present a case of probable right and\nprobable injury. The trial court's order in issuing or denying the writ of injunction will be reversed only on a showing of a clear\nabuse of discretion. There is no abuse of discretion in the issuance of a writ of injunction if the petition alleges a cause of action\nand the evidence tends to sustain it. Transport Co. of Texas v.

Even questions of law “can only be determined from a review of the entire record after a full and\nfinal hearing.” Transport Co. of Texas v. Robertson Transports, supra.\n\nThe district court concluded that appellee's sale of its fire extinguishers within Texas was exempted from regulation by\nTex.Ins.Code art. 5.43–1 § 6(d) (1981). That provision provides as follows:\n\n  The provisions of this article do not apply to the following:\n\n\n\n\n  firms engaged in the retailing or wholesaling of portable fire extinguishers as defined in Section 3, but not engaged in the\n  installation or recharging of them.... (Emphasis supplied).\n\nAppellants argue that the district court erred in applying this exemption to appellee because there was insufficient proof that\nappellee was “retailing or wholesaling” portable fire extinguishers. Although the proof is somewhat lacking in clarity, appellants\nconcede that Lawrence C. Lasalle, a salesman of Fires Out fire extinguishers, *495 testified that appellee “lost sales” due\nto the Fire Marshal's actions. Lasalle's testimony is some evidence from which the district court could conclude that appellee\nqualified for the statutory exemption.\n\nAppellants contend, alternatively, that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to ignore the § 6(d) exemption entirely.\nAppellants claim that § 6(d) is an anachronism, an exemption that the legislature should have omitted when art. 5.43–1 was\namended to regulate the sale of fire extinguishers as well as their installation and servicing. According to appellants, giving\neffect to § 6(d) defeats the legislature's intent to regulate the sale of portable fire extinguishers “as a measure of public safety.”\nIn support of their contention, appellants point to art. 5.43–1, § 1, which provides:\n\n             The purpose of this article is to regulate the leasing, renting, selling, and servicing of portable fire\n             extinguishers and the installing and servicing of fixed fire extinguisher systems, in the interest of\n             safeguarding lives and property. (Emphasis supplied).\n\n\nAppellee, in turn, relies upon the general rule of statutory construction that every word of the statute is presumed to have purpose\nand each sentence, clause, phrase and word should be given effect if reasonably possible.

Appellee reminds us that this rule is particularly appropriate in the case of a penal statute, such as art. 5.43–1 (see\n§ 12), because penal statutes must be strictly construed. First Bank of Bedford v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462454\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462454/first-state-bank-of-bedford-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577 (Tex.1978).\n\nUpon examination of the statute, it appears to this Court that the district court could reasonably have given effect to the\nexemption consistent with the statute's overall intent. Section 6(d) only exempts firms selling portable fire extinguishers “as\ndefined in Section 3.” Section 3(c) defines a “portable fire extinguisher,” in part, as one that “has a label of approval attached\nby a nationally recognized testing laboratory....” Accordingly, the § 6(d) exemption only applies to sales of approved fire\nextinguishers. Sale of unapproved fire extinguishers thus remains subject to sanction under art. 5.43–1, § 10(9) (prohibiting sale\nof fire extinguishers in violation of § 5(a)), and § 5(a) (prohibiting sale of unapproved fire extinguishers). Such a construction\npreserves the exemption and still gives effect to the legislative intent to make portable fire extinguishers safe.\n\nThe record supports appellee's contention that its product carries the label of approval by a “nationally recognized laboratory.”\nRonald Wells, director of General Laboratories, the test laboratory for appellee, testified that General Laboratories is a member\nlaboratory of the American Society of Testing Materials, a nationally recognized testing and certification board. Although\nWells indicated that Kansas, the state in which General Laboratories is located, had not certified it as a nationally recognized\nlaboratory, the conflicting evidence provided a reasonable basis for the district court's determination that General Laboratories\nwas nationally recognized.

No one disputes that the term “nationally recognized testing laboratory” is undefined by\nthe statute. The Fire Marshal asserts, nonetheless, that his statutory duty to “administer, enforce and carry out the applicable\nprovisions of the code ...,” Tex.Ins.Code Ann. art. § 1.09(a), requires him to set the correct standard. Perhaps the Fire Marshal's\nassertion is correct, especially since art. 5.43–1, § 2 gives the State Board of Insurance power to promulgate rules and regulations\nfor the administration of the article “through the State Fire Marshal.” Nevertheless, as the testimony of the Fire Marshal's\nmanager of licensing investigation, Quay Wood, makes plain, neither the State Board of Insurance nor the Fire Marshal has made\nany attempt to articulate a standard by which testing laboratories may be measured. The district court was free, accordingly,\nto conclude under the proof that General Laboratories was *496 “nationally recognized,” as required by §§ 3 and 5(a) of\nthe statute.\n\nBecause a reasonable construction of the statute permits appellee to claim the benefit of exemption from its regulation, this\nCourt concludes that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellee demonstrated a probable right\nto recover on the merits.\n\nThe district court's order is affirmed.\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The judgment of contempt and imposition of\npenalties grew out of a violation by relators of a temporary injunction granted by the court in the following fact situation.\n\nOn May 29, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Damron, a resident of Crane County, and Wm. W. Gruber, a resident of Tom Green County, presented\nto the judge of the aforesaid court at his chambers in Tom Green County their petition in which they sought injunctive relief\nagainst Kathleen Amberson, a resident of Dallas County, and John Coffee, G. L Holley and Louis Bankston, all residents of\nHoward County. It was alleged that plaintiffs were the owners of an interest in leasehold estates owned by Amberson Petroleum\nCompany in certain lands located in Sterling County, which estates were subject to a deed of trust lien given to secure an\nindebtedness in favor of Mrs. Amberson; that the indebtedness was not due until September 10, 1959, but that the defendant,\nJohn Coffee, as substitute trustee, had posted notices of his intention to sell the property on June 2nd under power of sale\ncontained in the deed of trust and unless restrained and enjoined from so doing would make the sale, to the plaintiffs irreparable\ninjury. They prayed for a restraining order, for a temporary injunction and for a permanent injunction until the debt should\nbecome due.\n\nUpon presentation of the petition to the District Judge a restraining order was issued restraining the defendant, John Coffee,\nfrom selling the property pending a hearing to be held on the prayer for a temporary injunction, which hearing was set at 10\no'clock a. m., June 8th, in the courtroom of the District Court in the courthouse at Sterling City, Sterling County, within *226\nthe 51st Judicial District. The issuance of the restraining order was conditioned upon the filing by Damron and Gruber of a\nbond in the penal sum of $7,500, conditioned as required by law. A bond in that sum, conditioned that Damron and Gruber\nwould abide the decision in the case and would pay all sums of money and costs which might be adjudged against them if ‘the\nrestraining order’ should be dissolved, in whole or in part, was approved and filed by the Clerk of the District Court, Sterling\nCounty, on June 2, and the sale advertised for that date was avoided.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing on June 8th the court granted a temporary injunction restraining and enjoining all defendants\nfrom selling the property at trustee's sale under the deed of trust pending final hearing and determination of the cause or until\nSeptember 10, 1959, whichever was earlier in time. The judgment contained the following order: ‘And the bond heretofore filed\nwith the Clerk upon issuance of the restraining order herein be, and is hereby continued in full force and effect as a temporary\ninjunction bond.’\n\n **286 On July 15th the District Judge, sitting in Sterling County, pursuant to a show cause order and after hearing, determined\nthat on July 7th relators, Coffee and Holley, did, in violation of the temporary injunction and in contempt of the court, sell and\ncause to be sold the property at trustee's slae to relator Holley, and that Coffee, as substitute trustee, executed, a deed conveying\nthe property to Holley, which deed had been filed for record and recorded in Sterling County. The court assessed a fine of $100\nagainst each of the defendants and ordered them confined in jail for twenty-four hours and thereafter until the fines and costs\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It is from these penalties that relators seek relief in this proceeding.\n [1] Relators recognize the collateral nature of the attack they make on the trial court's judgment and that they are entitled to\nrelief in this proceeding only if the judgment is void. They assert that the judgment is void for two reasons: because the trial\ncourt had no power, authority or jurisdiction to grant the temporary injunction, and because no bond was required or filed as\na condition precedent to the issuance of the writ of temporary injunction as required by Rule 684, Texas Rules of *227 Civil\nProcedure. If the order granting the writ of temporary injunction and the writ itself were void, then the judgment of contempt\nis also void.

Where the resident judge cannot hear and act upon the application by reason of his absence, sickness, inability, inaccessibility,\ndisqualification or refusal to act, when such facts are fully set out in the application or in an affidavit accompanying same, and\nif such judge refuses to act, such refusal shall be indorsed by said judge on such writ with his reasons therefor. In such case no\ndistrict judge shall grant the writ when the application therefor has once been acted upon by another district judge of this State.\n\n‘2. To stay execution, or to restrain foreclosure, sales under deeds of trust, trespasses, the removal of property, or acts injurious\nto or impairing riparian or easement rights, when satisfactory proof is made to such nonresident judge that it is impracticable\nfor the applicant to reach the resident judge and procure his action in time to effectuate the purpose of the application.\n\n‘3. When the resident judge cannot be reached by the ordinary and available means of travel and communication in sufficient\ntime to effectuate the purpose of the writ sought. In such case the applicant or his attorney seeking a writ on the ground of such\ninaccessibility shall attach to his application an affidavit fully stating the facts of such inaccessibility and his efforts made to\nreach and communicate with said judge, and the result thereof, and unless such efforts appear to have been fair and reasonable\nthe application shall not be heard. Such injunction may be subsequently dissolved upon it being **287 shown *228 that the\npetitioner did not first make reasonable efforts to procure a hearing upon said application before the resident judge.’\n\n\nArticle 4656 reads as follows:\n          ‘Writs of injunction granted to stay proceedings in a suit, or execution on a judgment, shall be returnable\n          to and tried in the court where such suit is pending, or such judgment was rendered; writs of injunction\n          for other causes, if the party against whom it is granted be an inhabitant of the State, shall be returnable\n          to and tried in the district or county court of the county in which such party has his domicile, according as\n          the amount or matter in controversy comes within the jurisdiction of either of said courts. If there be more\n          than one party against whom a writ is granted, it may be returned and tried in the proper court of the county\n          where either may ahve his domicile.’\n\n\n [2] It is settled that Art. 4656 only applies to and governs the issuance and return of writs and trial in cases in which the relief\nsought is purely or primarily injunctive.

Each of the cases was before\nthe respective Courts of Civil Appeals by appeal from the trial court's order, and dissolution of the various orders of restraint\nwas proper on the ground that they were irregularly and erroneously granted. The cases analyzed are therefore not regarded\nas controlling or as particularly persuasive.\n\n\nArticle 4643 was originally enacted in 1907 as a proviso to Article 2989 of the Revised Civil Statutes of 1895. Acts of Regular\n *231 Session, 30th Leg., ch. 107, p. 206. As thus amended Art. 2989 was codified as **289 Art. 4643 of the Revised Civil\nStatutes of 1911. In the codification of 1925 the first part of Art. 4643 of the 1911 statutes was carried forward as Art. 4642\nand the proviso was carried forward as Art. 4643. In the process of codification the language of the proviso was materially\naltered. We need note only a few of the pertinent alterations. In the original Act and in the 1911 statute it was provided that a\nnonresident district judge should have no power to grant a writ of injunction returnable to any other court than his own, unless\nthe resident judge was absent from his district, or was sick and unable to hear and act on the application, or was inaccessible, or\nhad refused to act, or was disqualified; and the applicant was required to set out the facts of, and relating to, the resident judge's\nabsence, sickness, inability to act, inaccessibility or disqualification in his application or in an accompanying affidavit. If the\nbasis for seeking action by a nonresident judge was inaccessibility of the resident judge the applicant was required to file with\nhis application an affidavit showing the efforts made to reach and communicate with the resident judge, and it was provided that\na nonresident judge should have no power to grant relief unless it appeared from the affidavit that a fair and reasonable effort\nhad been made to secure relief from the resident judge. But while providing that a nonresident judge would have no power\nto grant relief because of inaccessibility of the resident judge unless the required affidavit showed fair and reasonable efforts\nto obtain relief from the resident judge, the statute did not declare violative action by the nonresident judge voil. Instead, it\ndeclared that a violative injunction should be dissolved upon a showing that a reasonable effort had not been made to procure\na hearing before the resident judge. In the present statute there is no express reference to a want of power in a nonresident\njudge to act; a want of power can only be implied from the opening words of the Article: ‘No district judge shall grant a writ\nof injunction returnable to any other court than his own except * * *.’ Moreover, the Article still provides for dissolution of\nan injunction granted by a nonresident judge upon proof that the applicant ‘did not first make reasonable efforts to procure\na hearing upon said application before the resident judge.’ In the original Act and in the 1911 statute a ‘resident judge’ was\ndefined as one ‘in whose district the suit is, or is to be brought,’ and we will ascribe to the term that meaning even though the\ndefinition was eliminated in the 1925 codification. We interpret the words ‘in whose district the suit is * * * to be brought’\nto mean the district in which venue properly lies as shown on the face of the petition. Conversely, a nonresident *232 judge\nis one in whose district the suit is not filed or in whose district venue, as shown on the face of an unfiled petition, does not\nproperly lie. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Art. 4643 are interrelated and must be construed as overlapping.\n\nArticle 4656, with a few minor and unimportant changes in verbiage, is derived from what may be termed the first comprehensive\npractice act governing judicial proceedings in the State of Texas. It was enacted by the First Legislature of the State of texas\nin 1846. Gammel's Laws of Texas, Vol. 2, pp. 1669, 1711-1712.\n [5] Articles 4643 and 4656 are but two of a series of Articles in Title 76 of the Revised Civil Statutes of 1925, Vernon's\nAnn.Civ.St. art. 4642 et seq., dealing with injunctions. As written they formed a logical procedural whole applicable to our\npractice before adoption of the Rules of Civil Procedure in 1941. They contemplated that a trial judge could, upon presentation\nof a sworn petition therefor and before the filing of suit, grant a writ of temporary injunction without a hearing, Arts. 4647 and\n4648, effective upon the filing of bond, Art. 4649, whereupon the party to whom the writ was granted would file his petition and\nthe court's order with the clerk of the proper court, Art. 4650, the clerk would issue the writ, Art. 4652, and it would be served\nby an officer and **290 returned to the court from which it issued, Art. 4653, or to the court to which it was made returnable.\nArt. 4656.

Rule 681. Under the Rules of Civil Procedure the purpose once\nserved by an exparte temporary injunction in obtaining immediate restraint is now served exclusively by an ex parte restraining\norder, Rule 680, but it will be noted that Arts. 4643 and 4656 nowhere expressly mention or purport to govern issuance, service\nor return of restraining orders. However, a restraining order is one type of injunction, Riggins v. Thompson, supra; Ex parte\nZuccaro, supra, and inasmuch as restraining orders serve the same purpose under the Rules as was theretofore served, in part,\nby temporary injunctions, and in order to bring the statutes and the Rules into a harmonious whole, we interpret the term ‘writs\nof injunction’ as used in Arts. 4643 and 4656 to include ‘temporary restraining order’ as provided for in Rule 680. It is under\nthat interpretation *233 that we test the validity of the proceedings in the trial court in this case.\n\n [6] The proceedings leading up to the judgment of contempt against relators were undoubtedly irregular and erroneous. Upon\npresentation of the petition to the District Judge it was his duty to make any restraining order granted by him returnable to a\nDistrict Court of Dallas or Howard County, and he was authorized to grant it in the first instance only upon the filing of an\naffidavit showing the inaccessibility of the district judges of those counties and that fair and reasonable efforts had been made\nby the plaintiffs to reach such judges but that it was impracticable to reach them and to obtain action from one of them in time\nto halt the sale. Not only were the proceedings in the granting and return of the restraining order irregular and erroneous, but the\nproceedings in trying in Sterling County the right of the applicants to a temporary writ and in making it returnable to the District\nCourt of the 51st Judicial District Court were also irregular and erroneous. But the important question here is not whether the\nproceedings were irregular and erroneous, but whether they were wholly void. We hold that they were not.\n\n [7] The only types of suits in which the return of a writ as required by Article 4656 has been held jurisdictional are those to stay\nproceedings in a suit or execution on a judgment, Baker v.

Whereas in the two types of suits designated in the\nfirst clause of the statute any injunction granted, if not *234 made returnable to the court **291 where the suit is pending or\nthe judgment was rendered, would bring about an immediate conflict between two courts, often of coordinate jurisdiction, that\nwould not be true with respect to the issuance, return and trial of the right to an injunction in other types of suits, particularly\nwhen, as in this case, the injunctive relief is sought and granted before suit is filed. Our specific holding is that when a suit\nis one for purely injunctive relief other than to stay proceedings in a suit or execution on a judgment, and the relief is sought\nand granted before the filing of suit, the order granting the relief is not void for failure to make the restraining order returnable\nto the county of residence of the defendant or of one of them, nor is a writ of temporary injunction thereafter granted by the\ncourt issuing the restraining order, void.\n\n [8] We also hold that orders entered by a nonresident judge granting a temporary restraining order and a temporary writ of\ninjunction without requiring the filing of the statutory affidavit and the making of statutory proof of the inaccessibility of and\nefforts made to reach a resident judge, as provided by Art. 4643, are not void. If the Legislature had intended that such orders\nshould be void, there would have been no point in providing in the Article for a dissolution of writs granted in the absence of\nsuch affidavit and proof, with the burden placed on the person enjoined to prove facts entitling him to dissolution. Moreover,\nsignificance may be attached to legislative elimination from the article in the 1925 codification of all express language indicating\nthat in the absence of the required affidavit a nonresident judge would have no power to act.\n\n [9] [10] The requirement of Article 4643 for affidavit and proof before a nonresident judge is authorized to grant a writ\nand the requirement of Article 4656 for making writs returnable to and triable in the county of residence of the defendant are\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Their other obligation was to pay all\nsums of money and costs which might be adjudged against them if the restraining order should be dissolved in whole or in part.\nIn granting a writ of temporary injunction upon expiration of the restraining order, the trial court should have required a new\nbond with new contractual obligations, but we know of no reason why, with the signers of a restraining order bond before it\nand agreeing, the court could not extend the bond and the second obligation of its signers to comply with Rule 684.

(Emphases added) It is apparent from the above wording\nin Rule 684 that the two species of injunction are separate and distinct.\n\nRule 685 continues this distinction between the two types of injunctive relief by using the following language: ‘Upon the grant\nof a temporary restraining order or an order fixing a time for hearing upon an application for a temporary injunction * * *’. Rule\n686 further carries forward this distinction. This Rule makes a difference in the form of citations to be issued in the temporary\nrestraining order and temporary injunction. Rule 688 also recognizes this difference.\n\nThe order entered June 18, 1959 reciting a hearing and judgment of June 8, 1959 nowhere continues the restraining order, nor\ndoes it mention the restraining order except where the court provides the restraining order bond shall be extended to cover the\ntemporary injunction. I say the court had no right to so order. The temporary restraining order expired and was of no further\nforce and effect. Riggins v. Thompson, supra, and other authorities therein cited. When the restraining order expired *238 the\nbond expired with it. The only case in Texas which I have been able to find in point holds that a temporary restraining order bond\ncannot be continued as a bond for a temporary injunction. San Felipe Independent School Dist. v. Nelson, Tex.Civ.App.1934,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138, no writ history. In that case the San Antonio Court of Civil Appeals had held in their original opinion that\nsuch bond could be continued in force and effect. On rehearing they changed their holding and said:\n          ‘We wish to expressly state that we were in error in our original disposition of this cause wherein we held\n          that the bond given in connection with the issuing of the temporary restraining order might be substituted\n          for the bond required by law for the issuing of a temporary injunction. This, of course, cannot be done.’\n\n\n\nThe case of Porter v. Guggengeim, Tex.Civ.App.1937, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3930562\"><a href=\"/opinion/4164190/porter-v-guggenheim/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, wr. dism., is not in point on the question here before\nus. In that case the trial court had continued the restraining order in part. The Dallas Court of Civil Appeals rested its holding\nthat the bond could be used as a bond for the temporary injunction. That court said, ‘on the hearing, (for temporary injunction)\nthe court continued the restraining order, in part at least, as a temporary injunction, and the bond likewise continued in force\nand effect.’ (2), 2nd. col., at page 892. In our case, as pointed out above, the judge made no such order. He did not mention\nthe temporary restraining order at all, except as to the bond.\n\nThe effect of the majority opinion is to subject the surety on the temporary restraining order bond to new and additional liabilities\nfor which it did not contract when signing the original bond. It also overlooks the plain provision of the first sentence of Rule 684\n‘in the order granting any temporary restraining order or temporary injunction, the court shall fix the **294 amount of security\nto be given by the applicant.’ (Emphasis added) The trial court did not comply with this provision as no bond was set or given for\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Civ. St. art. 7047c-1, and Vernon's Ann. P. C. art. 131c-1). He then alleged that defendants George H.\nSheppard and his **718 deputies, including relator, were charged with the enforcement of the various provisions of that law.\n\nPlaintiff alleged that he was engaged in the business of selling cigarettes exclusively and solely in interstate commerce; that\nhis principal place of business was at Neosho, Mo., where he kept his office, warehouse, stock of cigarettes, etc.; and that\nthe manner of doing business was as follows: That he made his purchase of cigarettes in wholesale quantities; that they were\nshipped in interstate commerce to Neosho, Mo., and there held by him in stock; that he had one or more general salesmen in the\nstate of Texas and other solicitors and salesmen who worked under the supervision of the general salesmen; that his solicitors\nobtained orders from various persons within the state of Texas for cigarettes to be shipped from the stock held at Neosho, Mo.,\nwhich orders were forwarded to the general salesmen, who in turn sent them to the office at Neosho, Mo., for approval; that\nafter orders were accepted in this way the cigarettes were put in separate lots or packages according to the individual orders and\neach separate lot labeled with the name of the particular purchaser; that after the orders were filled in this manner, the cigarettes\nwere forwarded in one bulk shipment to the general salesmen, who then turned over to the salesmen the separate orders of\nthe various purchases, and these salesmen delivered same to the purchasers; that upon delivery of same the purchase money\nwas paid by the purchaser to the solicitor and was then forwarded to the office at Neosho, Mo. It is also shown that when the\ncigarettes were finally delivered to the purchasers and payment made, plaintiff had completely and finally parted with title to\nsame and had nothing further to do with them.\n\nPlaintiff alleged that although his bisiness as above conducted and the cigarettes sold by him in this manner were not subject\nto any of the provisions of the Cigarette Tax Law, being entirely within interstate commerce, nevertheless the Comptroller and\nhis assistants were seeking and attempting to make the provisions of the law applicable to him and to his business, and were in\nvarious ways interfering with him in the *63 conduct of his business by attempting to make applicable said law and to collect\nthe taxes therein provided for upon cigarettes handled by him. Allegations were made of several specific acts on the part of\nthe Comptroller and his assistants, including threats of prosecution against solicitors and salesmen, in an effort to make him\nand his business subject to provisions of the law.\n\nThe constitutionality of the Cigarette Tax Law was attacked on many grounds not necessary to mention here. Among other\nthings, it is alleged that the Comptroller ‘seeks to extend the terms of its prohibitions and penalties to persons and consumers\nbuying in interstate commerce, and thereby destroying, crippling and overthrowing the lawful business of your petitioner,\nby inculcating in the minds of the purchasers who buy from petitioner in interstate commerce that purchases under such\ncircumstances are criminal in their nature and violative of the terms of this act, and expose such purchasers and consumers so\nbuying from your petitioner to the pains, penalties and punishment of the law; and that the effect of such act and the extension of\nits penalties and prohibitions to such purchasers, customers and patrons is to deny to your petitioner the right under the Federal\nand State Constitutions, to conduct his business through the avenues of interstate commerce, and to lawfully sell to purchasers\ndesiring to consume his cigarettes such tobacco commodities, all of which is contrary to the interstate commerce clause of the\nFederal Constitution hereinbefore set out, and is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, in that it\nseeks to deprive the petitioner of his rights, his property and his liberty without due process of law; and by liberty as herein\nmeant is the liberty to pursue a lawful calling in and under the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Federal\nConstitution hereinbefore mentioned.’\n\nPlaintiff prayed for a restraining order to continue until such time as a hearing might be had for a temporary injunction and\nthat finally he be awarded a permanent injunction against the Comptroller and other defendants including relator. As the\ntemporary restraining order followed almost verbatim the language of the prayer in the petition, we set out the restraining portion\nthereof. Among other things, the defendants were commanded to ‘desist and refrain from harassing and annoying petitioner,\nhis agents, and servants in the prosecution and conduct of such interstate business as aforesaid, and commanding and *64\n **719 enjoining them to refrain from arresting and criminally prosecuting, under the Act aforesaid, your petitioner his agents,\nservants and employees, in the conduct of such interstate trade, and commanding and enjoining the said defendants and each of\nthem, their agents, servants and employees, to desist and refrain from seizing and confiscating the goods and commodities of\nyour petitioner, shipped in interstate commerce, and commanding said defendants, and each of them, their agents, servants and\nemployees, from wrecking the business of the petitioner by proclaiming to the general public that the purchase of petitioner's\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It was especially provided that the defendants should appear at 9 o'clock a. m. on August 1, 1935, and show cause why\na temporary injunction should not issue. On September 21, 1935, plaintiff Klugsberg filed in the district court a motion for\ncontempt as to defendants George H. Sheppard and relator Kimberlin. It is unnecessary to set out the various acts alleged to\nconstitute the contempt, as it was later found by the court that only one of them constituted a contempt.\n\nThe motion was set for hearing on September 26, 1935, before Judge Sarah T. Hughes, judge of the district court of the\nFourteenth judicial district, who had caused the restraining order to be issued, and relator was properly served with notice. On\nthe day set for hearing he appeared in person and by attorneys, and after full hearing upon the facts, relator was adjudged to be\nin contempt of court. The judgment of the court in this regard is as follows: ‘* * * But as to the said Sam Kimberlin, however,\nit is the opinion of the court, and the court so finds, that he, on *65 the 20th day of September, 1935, in willful violation of\nthe orders of the court referred to above, seized the quantity of cigarettes as described in the pleadings and testimony of the\nwitnesses from one Barrett, who had purchased same on a standing order, and from one Keys, who had purchased on regular\norder; and the court finds that acts of said Kimberlin were and are an interference with the previous orders of the court in this\ncase, and that said transactions with the said Barrett and the said Keys were interstate commerce between them and the plaintiff\nherein, and the court finds that the said Kimberlin by reason of the premises is in active contempt.’\n [1] [2] It is elementary that a habeas corpus proceeding in this court constitutes a collateral attack upon the judgment of\ncontempt in the lower court, and a writ of habeas corpus cannot be made to take the place of an appeal, certiorari, quo warranto,\nor writ of error. In such a proceeding as this the court cannot give relief unless the restraining order by the district judge, or the\njudgment of contempt or the writ of commitment thereunder, is absolutely void; and such voidness must be solely because of\nlack of jurisdiction.

B. No. 755; and was likewise without power\nto adjudge him in contempt for violating that portion of the order which sought to restrain him from confiscating cigarettes sold\nto Barrett and Keys by plaintiff. However, no contention is made that the district court did not have jurisdiction of the cause of\naction and of the parties. Nor can it be plausibly contended that the court did not have **720 power to issue the writ in order\nto accomplish some of the purposes therein mentioned. Apparently it is not contended that the business being conducted by\nplaintiff Klugsberg up to the time the cigarettes were delivered to the purchasers was not interstate business within the decisions\nof our federal courts. The court undoubtedly had the right to protect plaintiff and his business from some of the acts sought to\nbe *66 restrained by the writ. This being true, it is evident that the writ was not wholly void for want of jurisdiction, but at\nthe most was only voidable as to some of the acts sought to be restrained. In Ex parte Olson, supra, the court said: ‘The district\ncourt clearly had jurisdiction of relator and the subject-matter of the suit, and the injunction issued, therefore, cannot be said to\nbe absolutely void.’ The court cited Lytle v.

If the district court had jurisdiction of the parties and the matter adjudicated, the injunction cannot be said to be absolutely\nvoid. ‘Jurisdiction,’ in the sense here used does not mean simple jurisdiction of the particular case occupying the attention of\nthe court, but jurisdiction of the class of cases to which the particular case belongs.

The case in which the decree appealed from was one of injunction-the class over\nwhich the court that rendered it had unquestionable original jurisdiction.'\n\n [4] [5] We are decidedly of the opinion that even though plaintiff Klugsberg was engaged in interstate commerce, yet when\nthe cigarettes were finally delivered by the salesmen to the respective purchasers and the purchase money was paid to the\nsalesmen, they ceased to be in interstate commerce and became a proper subject for taxation under the provisions of the Cigarette\nLaw. The correct rule is reflected by such cases as Waring v. Mayor, etc., of Mobile, 8 Wall. (75 U.

R. A. 241. It becomes immaterial to determine here whether\nthe tax after the cigarettes were delivered to the purchasers was to be collected on the sale or on the consumption of same, as\nthis is a matter wholly between the purchaser and the officers of the state. Even if the attempt by the Comptroller and his *67\nassociates to lay the tax on the purchaser had an indirect effect upon the business of plaintiff (which we do not find it necessary\nto decide), this furnishes no ground for injunctive relief on his part. This is not a case of interference with business by reason\nof willful threats and intimidations, but the alleged interference results from a bona fide effort to enforce the tax laws of this\nstate; and such acts cannot be held to be such an interference with the business of plaintiff as to justify relief by injunction. It is\nadmitted that when the cigarettes were delivered to the purchaser and the purchase money paid, plaintiff had no further interest\nin them or in the transaction by which the sale was effected.\n\n\nNotwithstanding, however, the district judge was in error in holding that the cigarettes were still in interstate commerce and\nnotwithstanding the fact that the judge and notwithstanding the fact that the judgc erroneously held relator in contempt because\nhe confiscated the cigarettes after being delivered to the purchasers, yet we are of the opinion that the action of the court in\nthis regard was an error of judgment upon the law and facts, and was not absolutely void because of lack of jurisdiction.

It may be conceded that the writ, as issued, goes beyond the prayer in the\npetition for injunction, **721 and beyond the precise limits authorized by law. This would not, however, render the injunction\ngranted absolutely void, but, so far as the court was authorized to issue an injunction, it would and should be upheld. This, as\nwe understand, was directly held by our Supreme Court in Ex parte Testard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3912469\"><a href=\"/opinion/4148272/ex-parte-testard/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3912469\"><a href=\"/opinion/4148272/ex-parte-testard/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.’\n [6] In this connection we observe that relator had a speedy and effective remedy, easily available, to which he could have\nresorted and by which he could have no doubt removed the objectionable features from the writ long before he violated same\non September 20th. We think it was clearly his duty to file motion before the court to modify the restraining order, *68 and\nin the event he failed in that regard, to insist upon a prompt hearing to determine whether or not a temporary or permanent\ninjunction should issue. In the event a temporary or permanent injunction was issued, he had a speedy remedy by appeal to the\nCourt of Civil Appeals. It will be noted that the original order of the court directed the cause to be set for hearing at 9 o'clock\na. m. August 1st, which was only two days after the restraining order was issued. The judgment of contempt shows that by\nagreement of the parties the hearing was continued from day to day and the restraining order kept in force until it was violated\nby relator on September 20th. Thus it is seen that instead of moving to modify or dissolve the writ, and instead of seeking to\nhave a hearing on same, relator appears to have fully acquiesced in the action of the court until the 20th of September. If the\nrestraining order was too broad and included matters of doubtful validity, it was clearly the duty of relator to obey same and\nto seek a modification or dissolution. The language of the Court of Criminal Appeals in the case of Ex parte Warfield, supra,\nappears to be appropriate here. In that case it was said:\n‘It has been said that applicant was not shown to have violated the spirit of the injunction, inasmuch as no conversation was\nshown of a character calculated to persuade or lead away the wife of plaintiff; but his conduct was certainly in violation of\nthe letter of said injunction, and we cannot say that the court did not have the right and authority to make the injunction as\nbroad as it did, as, under the allegations of the petition, it is shown that defendant was not to be trusted in the society of Mrs.\nMorris, or to speak with her.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The various defendants settled with Cantu,\nand Fortis looked only to Cantu for its recovery. A divided court of appeals upheld a trial court finding that because Cantu's\nmedical expenses exceeded the settlement amount plus the benefits Fortis had paid, Fortis's subrogation claim was barred by the\nequitable “made whole” doctrine. We hold that the “made whole” doctrine must yield to Fortis's right to contractual subrogation\nunder the plain terms of the insurance policy.\n\n\n\n                                                         I. Background\n\nCantu suffered severe injuries in a car wreck and later sued the driver of the vehicle in which she was riding, his employer, the\nvehicle seller, and the vehicle manufacturer (Ford). Fortis intervened and asserted contractual subrogation and reimbursement\nrights to recoup from Cantu's tort recovery the amount of medical benefits it had paid under the policy.

She argued that her past and future medical expenses, exclusive of other amounts like pain and\nsuffering, exceeded the amount of the settlement plus what Fortis had already paid. Cantu argued that the “made whole” doctrine\nprecluded Fortis's contractual claims of subrogation and reimbursement. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of\nCantu, and a divided court of appeals affirmed. 1\n\n\n\n                                      II. Subrogation and the “Made Whole” Doctrine\n\nThis Court recognized the “made whole” doctrine twenty-seven years ago in Ortiz v. Great Southern Fire & Casualty Insurance\nCo. 2 The Ortiz family had a fire insurance policy from Great Southern on their home, but not the contents. 3 A fire caused\ndamages of $4,000 to the home and $11,614 to personal property, and Great Southern paid $4,000 for home repairs. 4 The\nOrtizes then sued Stacy–Mason, Inc., alleging that one of its employees negligently started the fire. Great Southern intervened,\nclaiming a right of equitable *645 subrogation. 5 After the Ortizes settled with Stacy–Mason for $10,000, the trial court\nawarded, and the court of appeals affirmed, $4,000 of that settlement to Great Southern. 6\n\nWe reversed, holding, “An insurer is not entitled to subrogation if the insured's loss is in excess of the amounts recovered from\nthe insurer and the third party causing the loss.” 7 We reasoned that one justification for equitable subrogation is to prevent the\ninsured from receiving a double recovery, first from the insurer, then from the third party. 8 We also recognized, however, that\nif the insured's total recovery is less than his or her losses, equity cuts the other way: “when ‘either the insurer or the insured\nmust to some extent go unpaid, the loss should be borne by the insurer for that is a risk the insured has paid it to assume.’ ” 9\nBecause the settlement in Ortiz encompassed both covered and noncovered items, we remanded for a determination of how\nmuch of the $10,000 related to house damage. 10\n\n [1] Ortiz would govern if Fortis were merely asserting a claim for equitable subrogation. But Fortis is not citing principles of\nequity to recover its money; its policy with Cantu conferred on Fortis two separate contractual rights of recovery, one styled\n“subrogation” and one styled “reimbursement.” 11 Fortis argues that these provisions authorize recovery from Cantu's $1.445\nmillion settlement with the defendants, and that neither provision is displaced by the “made whole” doctrine. We agree.\n\n\n\n                                   A. Equitable Subrogation v. Contractual Subrogation\n\nOur Ortiz decision addressed the “made whole” doctrine in the context of equitable subrogation, but it did not discuss how\nthe doctrine applies, if at all, to contractual subrogation. Other courts, however, have discussed whether the doctrine applies\nin the face of a contract that grants the insurer greater subrogation rights. For example, in Oss v. United Services Automobile\n *646 Ass'n, 12 the Fifth Circuit, applying Texas law in a diversity case, was confronted with facts similar to those in this\ncase. The insured was not made whole by the settlement following a car wreck, yet insurer USAA sought enforcement of\nits contractual subrogation rights under the policy. 13 Like Fortis, USAA urged the Fifth Circuit to reject the “made whole”\ndoctrine by distinguishing Ortiz as involving equitable rather than contractual subrogation. 14 The Fifth Circuit, relying on the\nEl Paso Court of Appeals' decision in Means v. United Fidelity Life Insurance Co., refused because it believed that, in Texas,\n“the same principles govern both equitable and contractual subrogation.” 15\n\nIn Means, the insureds had challenged the validity of United Fidelity's contractual subrogation right to foreclose on their 200–\nacre property. 16 The court noted, “Whether we have a purely equitable subrogation or, as here, a purely contractual one where\nboth Mr. and Mrs. Means agreed to the subrogation, the principles are the same, and the rights of United Fidelity Life Insurance\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Moreover,\nMeans nowhere addressed the “made whole” doctrine that we first articulated in Ortiz, nor could it have, since Ortiz was decided\nthree years later. When the El Paso Court of Appeals declared in Means that “the principles are the same” in contractual and\nequitable subrogation, it did so against a legal landscape that did not yet include the “made whole” doctrine. 18 For this reason,\nMeans is not particularly instructive, nor is Oss, which relies predominantly on Means.\n\nOther Texas courts of appeals have addressed the difference between equitable and contractual subrogation. For example, the\nAustin Court of Appeals in Lexington Insurance Co. v. Gray recognized the distinction between “legal” and “conventional”\nsubrogation. 19 The former is governed by equity; the latter by contract. 20 The court (1) observed that Texas courts have\ngiven “substance to the distinction,” (2) noted the “unusually ‘hospitable’ treatment that the right of subrogation has historically\nreceived in Texas,” especially express subrogation agreements, which are given “considerable weight” and are governed by\ngeneral contract law principles, 21 and (3) cited several cases holding that a subrogee invoking contractual subrogation can\n“recover without regard to the relative equities of the parties.” 22 Lexington did not specifically *647 involve the “made\nwhole” doctrine we had adopted a decade earlier in Ortiz, but it suggested that this equitable defense would not apply in the\nface of an express agreement whereby the parties agree in advance that the matter will be governed by contract principles rather\nthan equitable principles. Where the policy's terms govern subrogation, the court added, “there is no reason for the equitable\nprinciples usually found in subrogation cases to come into play.” 23\n\n\nA few years later, however, in Esparza v. Scott & White Health Plan, 24 the Austin Court of Appeals backed away from this\ninterpretation. The Esparzas settled for an amount that did not make them whole, and Scott and White sought subrogation under\nan express provision in the parties' insurance contract, citing Lexington as holding that the “made whole” doctrine should apply\nonly to equitable subrogation and not to contractual subrogation. 25 The court of appeals disagreed, stating:\n\n\n  The distinction we drew between legal and conventional subrogation in Lexington simply means that under conventional\n  subrogation no balancing of equities is necessary to determine whether the subrogee has a right to recover at all. While an\n  insurance contract providing expressly for subrogation may remove from the realm of equity the question of whether the\n  insurer has a right to subrogation, it cannot answer the question of when the insurer is actually entitled to subrogation or\n  how much it should receive....\n\n     ... To avoid injustice, the equities must still be balanced in deciding what amount, if any, the subrogee is entitled to receive\n    in a given case. 26\nThe court adopted the reasoning from Oss that a boiler-plate subrogation provision does not automatically negate an insurance\npolicy's fundamental purpose, which is to protect the insured by shifting the risk of loss to the insurer. 27 If anyone is to go\nunpaid, the court reasoned, it should be the insurance company. The court concluded that contracts “ ‘confirm, but [do] not\nexpand, the equitable subrogation rights of insurers,’ ” and the equities must still be balanced to achieve justice. 28\n\n [2] We do not disagree that equitable and contractual subrogation rest upon common principles, but contract rights generally\narise from contract language; they do not derive their validity from principles of equity but directly from the parties' agreement.\nThe policy declares the parties' rights and obligations, which are not generally supplanted by court-fashioned equitable rules\nthat might apply, as a default gap-filler, in the absence of a valid contract. If subrogation arises independent of any contract,\nthen an express subrogation agreement would be superfluous and serve only to acknowledge this preexisting right, a position\nwe reject. 29\n\n[3] Contractual subrogation clauses express the parties' intent that reimbursement should be controlled by agreed contract\n*648 terms rather than external rules imposed by the courts. The United States Supreme Court addressed this very point in a\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 30 insurer\nMid Atlantic was an ERISA plan fiduciary for the Sereboffs. When the Sereboffs were injured in an auto accident, Mid Atlantic\npaid the couple's expenses pursuant to the plan. 31 When the Sereboffs settled the tort claims that arose from the accident, Mid\nAtlantic filed suit under ERISA to collect the medical expenses it had paid. 32 Mid Atlantic sought reimbursement under an\n“Acts of Third Parties” provision in the plan. 33 The Sereboffs argued that the equitable defense of the “made whole” doctrine\nshould apply, even though language in the plan document was to the contrary. 34 The Court disagreed, comparing an action\nunder the “Acts of Third Parties” provision to an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement. 35 The Court\nrefused to apply the “made whole” doctrine, deeming the Sereboffs' equitable defenses “beside the point” because Mid Atlantic's\nsubrogation claims arose by written agreement. 36\n\n\nThis position was earlier adopted by the Fifth Circuit in another ERISA case, Walker v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. 37 That case,\nlike today's case, concerned a subrogation clause that granted a right of recovery against “any and all” third-party settlements.\nWalker brought a malpractice action against her dentist, alleging he propped open her mouth excessively, resulting in three\njaw surgeries and medical expenses of over $41,000. 38 Walker settled for $12,500, and the trial court awarded the insurer\nthe entire settlement amount as first-money reimbursement for the medical benefits it paid. 39 The Fifth Circuit held that “the\nPlan's language is unambiguous.... We agree with the district court in holding that the ‘any and all’ language plainly means\nthe first dollar of recovery (any) and 100% recovery (all) of the funds received by the plaintiff in the settlement, up to the full\namount of the benefits paid.” 40\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The three varieties of subrogation—equitable, contractual, and statutory—represent three separate\nand distinct rights that, while related, are independent of each other. Independent, however, does not mean co-equal. We\ngenerally adhere to the maxim that “equity follows the law,” which requires equitable doctrines to conform to contractual\nand statutory mandates, not the other way around. Where a valid contract prescribes particular *649 remedies or imposes\nparticular obligations, equity generally must yield unless the contract violates positive law or offends public policy. This\nCourt has “long recognized a strong public policy in favor of preserving the freedom of contract.” 41 And in Texas Ass'n of\nCounties County Government Risk Management Pool v. Matagorda County, we emphasized that insurers are well equipped to\nevaluate and reduce risk by, for example, “drafting policies to specifically provide for reimbursement.” 42 Fortis did exactly that,\ndrafting two separate recovery provisions that replaced equitable rights with specific contractual rights. Neither subrogation nor\nreimbursement clauses violate Texas public policy. 43 As we have stated, “ ‘the State's public policy is reflected in its statutes,’\n” 44 and Texas workers' compensation law specifically embraces an insurer's first-money right of subrogation, thus indicating\nno blanket legislative disfavor of such provisions. 45 It is indeed difficult to declare something contrary to public policy when\nstate law, both statutory and regulatory, actually suggests approval. 46 In a subrogation case arising under the Labor Code, the\nAmarillo Court of Appeals distinguished statutory subrogation from equitable and contractual subrogation. 47 The court looked\nonly at the statute's plain language in affirming the trial court's refusal to invoke its equitable powers to deny subrogation. 48\nWe agree with this modest, text-based approach.\n\n [9] Given this insurance policy's plain language, we are loathe to judicially rewrite the parties' contract by engrafting extra-\ncontractual standards that neither the Legislature nor the Texas Department of Insurance has thus far decided to promulgate. As\nwe have said before, balancing dueling policy concerns is generally for non-judicial bodies, and it remains the “better policy\nfor the contracts of insurance to be changed by the public body charged with their supervision, the State Board of Insurance,\nor by the Legislature, rather than for this Court” to contravene the express language of insurance contracts with equitable\narguments. 49 The *650 contrary, however—replacing equitable protections with specific contract language—is not unknown\nin Texas law. 50 Parties are thus free to negate the “made whole” doctrine contractually, and to do so before an event occurs\nthat triggers medical benefits under the policy. 51\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Subrogation Under Cantu's Insurance Contract With Fortis\n\n [13] [14] We turn now to the specific language of the policy in issue, which defines the parties' rights and obligations. It\ncontains a section called “Recovery,” which includes a “Subrogation Right” provision and a separate (and broader) “Right\nof Reimbursement” provision. The former establishes a right of subrogation: “Upon payment of benefits, We [Fortis] will be\nsubrogated to all rights of recovery a Covered Person [Cantu] may have against any person or organization.” 54 The provision\ncontinues: “Such right extends to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment; but is limited to the amount of benefits We have\npaid.” 55 Fortis thus retained an unfettered right to recover the proceeds from *651 the settlement of the underlying suit, the\nonly limitation being the amount of recovery—what Fortis had paid under the contract. Nowhere does this provision suggest\nthat Cantu must first be “made whole” for Fortis to recover. This provision does not use the modifier “first money,” but its\nmeaning is not imprecise or ambiguous. The contract's specific language controls Fortis's right to subrogation, and the equitable\ndefense of the “made whole” doctrine must give way.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that Fortis is contractually entitled to recover from the $1.445 million settlement the total amount of\nbenefits it paid to Cantu. 56\n\n\n\n                                                III. Fortis's Claims Against Ford\n\n [15] [16] [17] Fortis also asserts that the court of appeals erred in not considering the validity of a pretrial agreement\nregarding its claims against defendant Ford. At a pretrial conference convened under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11, Fortis\nagreed to divide the proceeding into two phases: first Cantu would litigate the case with the defendants completely independent\nfrom Fortis, and then Fortis would look only to Cantu to resolve its claim for subrogation. The Rule 11 agreement and stipulations\nin the record, which narrowed the issues presented to the trial court, make clear that Fortis has unequivocally relinquished\nany claims against Ford. Just as Cantu entered into and is bound by the specific language in the insurance agreement, Fortis\nentered into and is bound by the specific language in the Rule 11 agreement. Rule 11 aims to remove misunderstandings and\ncontroversies that accompany verbal assurances, and the written agreements “speak for themselves.” 57 As this is a valid pretrial\nagreement under Rule 11, the trial court had a duty to enforce its terms. 58 Hence, the trial court did not err in dismissing Fortis's\nclaims against Ford, and the court of appeals did not err in affirming that portion of the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                          IV. Conclusion\n\n [18] The equitable “made whole” doctrine is inapplicable when the parties' agreed contract provides a clear and specific right\nof subrogation. Accordingly, while we affirm that part of the court of appeals' judgment regarding respondent Ford, we reverse\nand remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REMEDIES CODE ANN. § 51.016 (West 2008). Gray Wireline\nService, Inc. complains that the trial court erred by reforming the employment agreements rather than sending those issues to\nbe determined by the arbitrator in contravention of the employment agreement and by refusing to stay the pending litigation in\nthe trial court. GWSI further complains that the trial court erred by granting a temporary injunction in favor of Steve Gray and\nCGN Leasing. Because *467 we find that the trial court erred by reforming the employment agreements but should have sent\nthat issue to arbitration, and erred by denying the motion to stay the litigation, we reverse the judgments of the trial court and\nremand to that court for further proceedings. Additionally, because we find that the temporary injunction did not comply with\nthe Rules of Civil Procedure, we reverse the order granting the temporary injunction and order that it be dissolved.\n\n\nBackground\nSteve Gray formed GWSI, a cased-hole wireline company, which operated primarily in Texas. In 2006, the shareholders of\nGWSI agreed to sell a portion of their shares to Centre Partners, Inc. and by doing so Centre Partners, Inc. gained control of\nGWSI. The new owners entered into employment agreements with Larry Cavanna, David Gray, Steve Gray, and Kenneth M.\nNester, Sr. 1 which each contained a non-compete clause that terminated at various times depending on the reasons for the\nindividual's departure, but was generally two years in duration. Each of the four departed from GWSI at various times, with\nNester being the last to leave, terminating his employment on August 15, 2009.\n\nGWSI originally filed suit in mid-October of 2009 against Larry Cavanna, David Gray, Steve Gray, Kenneth M. Nester,\nSr., Ismael Alvarez, Extreme Wireline Trucks & Equipment, LLC, Andrew E. Hughes, Bruce R. Barnett, and CGN Leasing,\nLLC seeking a temporary restraining order and asserting various causes of action based on violations of the employment\nagreement, including tortious interference, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment,\nunfair competition, violation of Penal Code Chapter 33, conversion, and trespass against the various defendants. The trial court\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             5\n\fGray Wireline Service, Inc. v. Cavanna, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011)\n\n\nissued a temporary restraining order, which was subsequently extended by agreement of the parties so that they could conduct\nlimited expedited discovery. Shortly after the issuance of the temporary restraining order, Steve Gray and CGN Leasing, LLC\nfiled a demand for arbitration in accordance with Steve Gray's employment agreement, and included a cause of action for\na declaratory judgment in the arbitration demand. GWSI ultimately withdrew its request for a temporary injunction the day\nbefore the scheduled hearing. Cavanna, David Gray, and Nester then filed a “Motion to Reform and Alternate Motion for\nDetermination” seeking reformation of the non-compete clause pursuant to Section 15.51(c) of the Business and Commerce\nCode or alternatively a determination that they were in full compliance with the employment agreements. GWSI subsequently\nfiled its own demand for arbitration as to Steve Gray, Cavanna, David Gray, and Nester with the American Arbitration\nAssociation as well as a motion to stay the litigation pending the arbitration with the trial court.\n\nAfter a hearing on the motions, the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration relating to the motion to reform and by\nseparate order granted the motion to reform and reformed the employment agreements of Cavanna, David Gray, and Nester.\nThe trial court then granted the motion to compel arbitration but denied *468 the motion to stay the trial court's proceedings\npending the arbitration as to all of the defendants except for Cavanna, David Gray, Nester, Steve Gray, and CGN Leasing. The\ntrial court did stay the pending litigation against them until the completion of the arbitration.\n\n\nThe Non–Compete Agreements\nEach of the employment agreements contained the following language which Cavanna, Gray, and Nester sought to modify in\nthe motion to reform:\n\n  Geographic Limitation. The geographic limitation for the Non–Compete Obligations is any state, province (or substantially\n  equivalent designation of a geographic area within a foreign country), or Outer Continental Shelf region (A) in which the\n  Company provided its products, services, or activities during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of termination of\n  Executive's employment with the Company, (B) in which the Company had plans to provide or contemplated providing its\n  products, services, or activities during the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of termination of Executive's employment,\n  or (C) in which a customer or client of the Company, with whom Executive had or made contact or had access to information\n  and/or files about during Executive's employment with the Company or within the twelve (12) months prior to the date of\n  termination of Executive's employment with the Company, is located.\n\n  Acknowledgments. Executive acknowledges and agrees that:\n\n  ...\n\n  (g) the restricted period set forth is a material term of this Agreement and that the Company is entitled to Executive's\n  compliance with these terms during that full period. Therefore, Executive agrees that the restricted period will be tolled\n  during any period of non-compliance by Executive. If the Company must seek injunctive relief or judicial intervention to\n  enforce this Agreement, the restricted time period set forth herein does not commence until Executive is judged by a court\n  of competent jurisdiction to be in full compliance with this Agreement;....\n\nThe trial court reformed the first paragraph to include the language “as evidenced by existing memoranda, minutes, or other\ncorrespondence (including, without limitation, internal or external presentations)” in paragraph (B) of the geographic restriction\nsection. The trial court also reformed the tolling paragraph to delete the last sentence and to add the following: “If the Company\nmust seek injunctive relief or judicial intervention to enforce this Agreement, the restricted time period set forth herein does\nnot commence until a court of competent jurisdiction deems it should commence.”\n\n\nArbitration\n [1] [2] [3] [4] In evaluating a motion to compel arbitration, a court must first determine whether a valid arbitration\nagreement exists, and then whether the agreement encompasses the claims raised.

Rather, it is which\nclaims to be determined by the arbitrator that are at issue, specifically, the motion to reform. Therefore, the burden is on Cavanna,\nGray, and Nester to establish that the motion to reform the non-compete agreements is not within the scope of the arbitration\nagreement. See J.M. Davidson, 128 S.W.3d at 227.\n\nGWSI complains that the reformation of the non-compete agreements by the trial court was not allowed within the limited\ncategories of relief allowed by the arbitration clause, but that the issue of reformation should be determined by the arbitrator\nbecause reformation pursuant to Business and Commerce Code section 15.51(c) is an issue to be determined at a final hearing\non the merits. Because of this, GWSI contends that pursuant to the arbitration clause, the trial court could not permanently\nand finally reform the agreements prior to a determination on the merits at a final hearing, which should have been before\nthe arbitrator.\n\n [15] Cavanna, Gray, and Nester responded by contending both in the trial court and to this Court that the trial court's\nreformation of the employment agreements was allowed pursuant to the arbitration clause because it constitutes “other equitable\nrelief” as allowed in the arbitration clause. Their position is that the term “interim” does not apply to the entire phrase\n“interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief.” We disagree. The arbitration clause clearly contemplates that only\ntemporary relief may be sought in the trial court. In order for Cavanna, Gray, and Nester's interpretation to be correct, the\nphrase immediately following “interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief” which states “until the arbitration award\nis rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved” would have to be ignored entirely. Any equitable relief to be granted\nby the trial court would have to be interim in nature only, and thus that relief would seemingly be subsumed in or otherwise\nresolved at the final hearing on the merits. The trial court's reformation of the non-compete agreements can only be construed\nas a permanent reformation, which was not within the exception to the arbitration clause in the employment agreements.\n\n [16] Additionally, we agree that reformation pursuant to section 15.51(c) of the Business and Commerce Code is a remedy to\nbe granted at a final hearing, whether on the merits or by summary judgment, not as interim relief.

Cavanna, Gray, and Nester contend that there are two provisions outside of the arbitration provisions in the employment\nagreements which establish that the trial court was the proper forum for the issue of the reformation of the non-compete\nagreements rather than to be determined through arbitration. The first is the reference to “a court of competent jurisdiction”\nwithin the tolling provision. The second is contained in the next paragraph, paragraph (h) in the acknowledgment section which\nstates:\n\n             (h) the covenants contained in Paragraphs 8 through 12 are reasonable with respect to their duration,\n             geographic area and scope.

When we consider the factual allegations contained within the motion to reform, we find that\nthese claims necessarily “touch matters” that are covered by, have a “significant relationship” to, are “inextricably enmeshed”\nwith, or are “factually intertwined” with the contract that contains the arbitration agreement. See Pennzoil Co. v. Arnold Oil\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1368686\"><a href=\"/opinion/1368686/pennzoil-company-v-arnold-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2000, orig. proceeding). Thus, we find that Cavanna, Gray, and Nester have\nnot established an affirmative or other defense to the arbitration clause sufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of\narbitration, and therefore the trial court erred in ruling on the motion to reform. We sustain issue one. Because of our holding\nsustaining the first issue, we do not reach the second issue relating to the arbitrators determining arbitrability.\n\n\nStay of Proceedings\n [18] In its third issue, GWSI complains that the trial court erred by denying its motion to stay the proceedings entirely pending\nthe outcome of the arbitration. The trial court granted the motion to stay relating to Steve Gray, Cavanna, David Gray, Nester,\nand CGN Leasing but denied the motion as it relates to the other defendants.\n\n *472 [19] Federal law requires courts to stay litigation of claims that are subject to arbitration until arbitration is completed.\n9 U.S.C.A. § 3 (West 2009); In re Merrill Lynch Trust Co. FSB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894889\"><a href=\"/opinion/894889/in-re-merrill-lynch-trust-co-fsb/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195–96 (Tex.2007) (orig. proceeding). Even\nwhen a party has brought arbitrable claims against one party and claims not subject to arbitration against another party in the\nsame lawsuit, courts should stay all litigation if the collateral litigation addresses the same issues as arbitration which threatens\nto render the arbitration moot. See In re Merrill Lynch Trust Co. FSB, 235 S.W.3d at 195–96.\n\nNone of the non-signatories have filed briefs in this Court. However, our review of the claims indicates that the central issue\nto all is the purported violation of the non-compete agreements. Therefore, the litigation should be stayed pending the outcome\nof the arbitration and the trial court erred to order otherwise. We sustain issue three.\n\n\nTEMPORARY INJUNCTION\n [20] GWSI indicated in its notice of appeal that it was appealing the trial court's order granting a temporary injunction against it\nand in favor of Steve Gray and CGN Leasing. Steve Gray and CGN Leasing contend that any complaint regarding the temporary\ninjunction has been waived because no issue was raised complaining of the trial court's entry of the temporary injunction. GWSI,\nin its reply brief, acknowledged the failure to raise the issue but argues that the injunction order is void on its face; therefore,\nthe issue is not waived by the failure to complain about the injunction order in the original appellant's brief.\n\n [21] Rule 683 of the Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth part of the requirements for a temporary injunction. See TEX.R.\nCIV. P. 683. Rule 683 requires that “[e]very order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for\ntrial on the merits with respect to the ultimate relief sought.” TEX.R. CIV.

We further find that the trial court erred by denying the motion to stay the litigation\nas to the non-signatories to the employment agreements until the completion of the arbitration. We order that the temporary\ninjunction is void and order the trial court to dissolve it. We reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings. The\nstay of the trial court proceedings issued by this Court on March 11, 2011 is hereby lifted.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      David Gray and Steve Gray are both defendants in the trial court proceedings. On appeal, the issue relating to Steve Gray and\n       CGN Leasing, LLC involves only the temporary injunction. The other issues relating to the reformation, the arbitration, and the stay\n       of proceedings involves David Gray but not Steve Gray.

In three issues,\nappellant, David Henke, contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant the motion to dissolve because:\n\n  (1) the portions of the underlying orders which comprise the temporary injunction are subject to being declared void and\n     dissolved because they fail to meet the mandatory requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 1 in that they: (a) do\n     not specify a trial date, (b) do not set forth the reason for the issuance of the temporary injunction, (c) are not specific as to\n     the terms of the temporary injunction, and (d) do not contain reasonable detail as to the act or acts sought to be restrained\n     without reference to the complaint or other document;\n\n\n  (2) while the parties agreed to a temporary injunction, the injunctive provisions as embodied in the orders constitute a\n     permanent injunction in the absence of an order setting the case for trial; and\n\n       (3) the basis for the temporary orders was to provide an orderly manner for the liquidation of collateral—because the\n          collateral has been liquidated and the proceeds applied to the debt owed Peoples State Bank, the reasons for the\n          issuance of the temporary injunction no longer exist.\n\n   We affirm the trial court's order.\nThe record reflects the trial court rendered: (1) a temporary restraining order, signed on August 8, 1997; (2) an agreed order,\nsigned on August 22, 1997, granting a temporary injunction; (3) an agreed order, signed on September 5, 1997, modifying the\ntemporary orders (the temporary restraining order of August 8 and the agreed temporary injunction of August 22); and (4) an\nagreed order, signed on *720 September 16, 1997, modifying the temporary restraining order (and all temporary injunction\norders) and providing for the terms and conditions for the sale of cattle.\n\nHenke could not appeal the temporary restraining order; however, he had twenty days within which to perfect an appeal from\nthe remaining temporary orders. TEX.R.APP. P. 42; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014 (Vernon 1997). Henke\ndid not appeal any of the temporary orders.\n\nOn April 22, 1999, Henke filed a motion to dissolve the temporary injunction and the subsequent modifying orders. The trial\ncourt denied the motion on April 27, 1999 stating, “Henke has not timely appealed or otherwise challenged the Orders and ...\nhe has agreed to the Orders.” Henke appeals from the trial court's order denying his motion to dissolve.\n\n\n\n                                               A.

Recognition of\n              the principle that the trial court has no duty to reconsider the validity of the original grant of temporary\n              injunction upon motion to dissolve enables the trial court to dispose of motions to dissolve solely upon\n              the pleadings when the motion to dissolve, on its face, shows that the litigant offers no new evidence.\n\nId. at 835.\n\n[15]    At the hearing on the motion to dissolve, Henke argued the orders he had agreed to were “void.” He stated:\n\n              Under the case law and under the Rules of Civil Procedure a temporary injunction must set forth a date\n              for trial in order for it to be valid.... And also, if it does not contain a trial setting and if it does not contain\n              findings as to the reason for it, it is void and may not be made valid by waiver.\n\n\n [16] [17] Initially, it appears the trial court's failure to comply with Rule 683 is fundamental error. The requirements of rule\n683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed. InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr.

If the error is fundamental, the trial court had a duty to reconsider the grant of the temporary injunction and the\nmodifying orders. See Cellular Marketing, 784 S.W.2d at 735. However, because the orders were agreed, they are not subject\nto attack by Henke. See Alexander v. Alexander, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1710928\"><a href=\"/opinion/1710928/alexander-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 805 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1963, no writ). Because\nHenke actively agreed to each order, we hold the deficiencies in the orders are not fundamental error.\n\n [18] Henke contends the temporary injunction should have been dissolved because of changed conditions. Henke argues the\nagreed order of September 16, 1997, provided for the liquidation of collateral (sale of cattle) and the application of the proceeds\nto the indebtedness of his creditors. Henke contends the collateral has been liquidated and the proceeds have been applied to\nthe debt he owed Peoples State Bank. Thus, he argues, the reason for the temporary injunction no longer exists.\n\n *722 After reviewing the record, we hold Henke did not prove a change in the circumstances made the basis of the temporary\ninjunction. We note that Henke's motion to dissolve alleges only the violation of Rule 683 and not any changed conditions. The\nrecord reflects that Henke only argued changed conditions at the hearing on the motion to dissolve. Henke argued:\n\n              [T]he whole point of the order is now moot. Peoples Bank was paid in December of 1997. They continue\n              to pursue Mr. Henke and raise their attorneys' fees up to a quarter of a million dollars level when they\n              were paid within three months of filing this lawsuit. The purpose for the injunction doesn't exist anymore.\n              All the money that is going to be collected has been collected months and months ago.\n\n\nHenke's argument is no evidence that circumstances had changed. The agreed order modifying temporary orders, signed\non September 5, 1997, states that Henke was indebted to Peoples State Bank, First State Bank, Prairie Livestock, Friona\nAgricultural Credit Corporation, and several other entities. Henke made no effort to prove that all these entities had been paid\nin full.\n\nIn addition, the order states:\n\n              In the event disbursements to PSB [Peoples State Bank] for application to the Henke's debt result in\n              payment in full of Henke's debt to PSB, then, all additional proceeds that are distributed to PSB under the\n              provisions of this order are to be maintained by PSB in an interest-bearing escrow account and disbursed\n              only upon further order of this Court.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(Vernon Supp.1982),\nalleging they had been damaged by their purchase of a defective mechanical bucking bull. Trial was to a jury which answered\nthe Plaintiffs' issues generally in favor of the Plaintiffs. However, the jury also answered issues which submitted the Defendant's\ntheory that the dispute had been previously compromised and settled in favor of the Defendant. Based on the latter findings, a\ntake nothing judgment was entered against the Plaintiffs who now bring this appeal. We affirm.\n\nOn February 18, 1981, the parties entered into a written agreement by which the Defendant agreed to sell to the Plaintiffs the\nbucking mechanical bull for the total price of $5,250.00, the terms being the sum of $1,000.00 cash paid to the Defendant on\nthe date of the contract, $1,500.00 to be paid on the date of delivery and the balance by a series of IOUs. The bull was delivered\nto the Plaintiffs in El Paso about the first of March and the $1,500.00 was paid to the Defendant. Plaintiffs then took the device\nto their place of entertainment in Juarez, Mexico, and it immediately started breaking down. This occurred on three or four\noccasions. According to the Defendant, one of the Plaintiffs then came to the Defendant in El Paso some time in March, and a\nnew agreement was entered into whereby the parties agreed to rescind the sale. The sum of $1,000.00 in cash was immediately\nrepaid to the Plaintiffs as well as $500.00 of the IOUs. Defendant agreed that when the Plaintiffs delivered the bull back to\nhim in El Paso he would give the Plaintiffs the balance of their cash and notes that they had paid on the contract. The Plaintiffs\nthereafter never returned the bucking bull, although the defendant was ready, able and willing to return the balance of the\npurchase price upon the return of the bull.\n\nOn June 26, a letter termed a Deceptive Trade Practices Act Notice was mailed to the Defendant by the Plaintiffs' attorney. By\nit, demands were made for the balance of the purchase price, the cost of certain repairs made to the machine, losses of business\nsuffered by the Plaintiffs and attorney's fees. Thereafter the suit was filed and the trial resulted. At the trial, the jury returned\nissues in favor of the Plaintiffs regarding two Deceptive Trade Practices Acts and breaches of express and implied warranties.\nIn addition, they found that the Plaintiffs had suffered $4,400.00 in actual damages and $4,700.00 in lost profits. No attack by\nthe Defendant is made on this appeal as to these findings.\n\nThe findings that are the subject of this appeal are those regarding Special Issue Nos. 27, 28 and 29. The jury determined by\nNo. 27 that the Plaintiffs and Defendant *93 entered into an agreement for the return of the mechanical bull to El Paso and\nthe refund of the purchase monies, by No. 28 that the Plaintiffs after that agreement refused to return the said mechanical bull,\nand by No. 29 that the Defendant stood ready, able and willing to refund said monies upon return of the mechanical bull. On\nthe basis of these answers, the court entered the take nothing judgment.\n\nThe Plaintiffs' first point of error alleges that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law based upon the favorable jury\nfindings on their cause of action and award of damages. Under the point, they further argue that as a matter of law Special Issue\nNos. 27, 28 and 29 were either improperly submitted or were immaterial to the verdict as a matter of law. The Plaintiffs' position\nis that the statutory cause of action created by the Deceptive Trade Practices Act can only be defended against by the statutory\ndefenses specifically enumerated in the Act.

Telles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2398049\"><a href=\"/opinion/2398049/hernandez-v-telles/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983)\n\n\nthe Defendant proves: (1) that he received statutory notice of the claim, (2) that within thirty days of the date of said notice he,\n(3) tendered to the consumer the amount of actual damages claimed and expenses reasonably incurred in asserting the claim.\nThe Plaintiffs argue that there is no evidence to prove that the defendant ever complied with the Act.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Regardless of the statute, the issues in question submitted the Defendant's theory that there\nwas a compromise and settlement of the cause of action between the parties in March, 1981. A disputed or unliquidated claim\nis the basis for a compromise. The law has always favored the resolution of controversies through compromise and settlement\nrather than through litigation and it has always been the policy of the law to uphold and enforce such contracts if they are\nfairly made and are not in contravention of some law or public policy. 15A Am.Jur.2d, Compromise and Settlement, secs. 2\nand 5 (1976). We hold that even the strong policy of the statute to protect consumers against false, misleading and deceptive\nbusiness practices, which is the foundation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act does not overrule the stronger policy of the\nlaw favoring settlements of disputes. A compromise and settlement agreement is subject to the general principles of the law\nof contracts. An enforceable agreement of compromise requires an offer of compromise, a meeting of minds of the parties and\nan unconditional acceptance within the time and on the terms offered. It is essential that the amount of the claim be disputed.\n12 Tex.Jur.3d, Compromise and Settlement, sec. 4 (1981). All of the recited elements were met according to the testimony\nof the Defendant, and the special issues in question together with any necessary implied findings by the court resolved the\ndispute in the Defendant's favor. The original contract of sale was replaced by the new agreement made by the compromise\nand settlement. It was the Plaintiffs who breached the new agreement and they should not be in a position to profit by their\nbreach. The first point is overruled.\n\n [8] [9] [10] The Plaintiffs' second point of error is that the trial court erred in overruling their objections to the submission of\nSpecial Issue Nos. 27, 28 and 29, as they were not controlling issues on any theory of defense and had no effect upon the liability\nissues in the case. As previously discussed, we disagree with this contention. Also under this point, the Plaintiffs argue that\nthere was no evidence or insufficient evidence to support the submission. We have considered only the evidence and inferences\ntherefrom which support the jury's findings and the no evidence argument is overruled. Having considered all of the evidence,\nthe factual insufficiency argument is likewise overruled.\n\nAlso under the point, the Plaintiffs complain because the pleadings supporting these defensive issues were not filed within\nseven days of trial without leave of court. It appears this pleading was filed as a trial amendment and no objection appears in\nthe record to the filing of this pleading or to the evidence supporting it. The objection now made on appeal as to the late filing\nof the answer is untimely and the objection has been waived. The second point of error is overruled.\n\n*94 The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because we conclude that Garza is entitled to the relief sought, we conditionally grant the writ.\n\n\n\n                                                       BACKGROUND\n\nThis mandamus proceeding arises out of a dispute over a family business. In October 1995, Real Party in Interest Jaime Trevino\nand his cousin, Alfred G. Garza, entered into a partnership agreement to operate a business called Lobo Security. According to\nTrevino, however, his uncle, Alfred S. Garza, was his true partner. For personal financial reasons, Alfred S. Garza had requested\nthat the partnership agreement name his son, Alfred G. Garza, as Trevino's partner. During their partnership, Trevino claims\nthat Alfred S. Garza diverted partnership funds for his own benefit and the benefit of his immediate family members. On March\n1, 2001, Alfred S. Garza died.\n\nOn July 27, 2001, Trevino sued Alfred S. Garza's estate for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. Trevino also\nsued his aunt, Relator Andrea Garza, Alfred G. Garza, his partner under the partnership agreement, and two of his other cousins\nfor fraud, conversion, civil conspiracy, and aiding and abetting Alfred S. Garza's breach of fiduciary duty. Additionally, Trevino\nsought a declaratory judgment regarding the characterization of the partnership's property. In response, Alfred G. Garza filed a\ncounterclaim for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and conversion.\nAlfred G. Garza also sought declaratory relief.\n\nOn August 8, 2001, the trial court entered a temporary injunction, preventing the defendants (“the Garzas”) from depleting their\nassets during litigation. The Garzas were enjoined from “[d]estroying, removing, concealing, encumbering, transferring, or\notherwise harming or reducing the value of the property of one or both of the parties.” And, they were enjoined from “[s]elling,\ntransferring, assigning, mortgaging, encumbering, or in any other manner alienating any of the property of [Trevino] or [the\nGarzas], whether personalty or realty, and whether separate or community, except as specifically authorized” by the trial court.\nThe temporary injunction did permit the Garzas to incur indebtedness to pay legal expenses. It did *270 not, however, contain\na trial setting date or provide for a bond.\n\nA year later, the Garzas moved to dissolve the temporary injunction. Trevino then filed his first motion for contempt, which\nwas denied by the trial court. On April 17, 2003, Trevino filed his second motion for contempt, arguing that Andrea Garza had\nviolated the temporary injunction by borrowing $112,000 against her homestead to pay for her legal fees and costs. According\nto Trevino, the temporary injunction's prohibition against encumbrances trumped the provision allowing Garza to fund her\ndefense. After holding an evidentiary hearing, the trial court signed a “Judgment of Contempt” on May 28, 2003, ordering\nGarza, on or before July 1, 2003, to effectuate a release of lien and pay Trevino's attorney $3,500 and costs of the proceeding.\nOn June 26, 2003, Garza filed this mandamus proceeding, seeking relief from the trial court's contempt judgment. 2\n\n\n\n                                                         MANDAMUS\n\n [1] [2] Mandamus issues only to correct a clear abuse of discretion or a violation of a duty imposed by law when there is no\nother adequate remedy at law.

Thus, she argues that\nthe trial court abused its discretion in holding her in contempt for violating a void order. See Ex parte Shaffer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485937\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485937/ex-parte-shaffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301–02 (Tex.1983) (holding that trial court abuses its discretion by holding party in contempt for violating void order). In\nresponse, Trevino argues that Garza has waived her complaint by agreeing to the terms of the temporary injunction.\n\nThe temporary injunction states that “[t]he parties have agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below.”\nAlthough counsel for the Garzas signed the temporary injunction, his signature was prefaced by the phrase, “Approved as to\nForm Only.” However, in “Defendants' Motion to Dissolve or Modify Temporary Restraining Order,” counsel for the Garzas\nadmits that at the time the temporary injunction was entered, the Garzas had agreed to its terms. The record, therefore, shows\nthat the Garzas did, in fact, agree to the terms of the temporary injunction.\n\n [3] According to Trevino, because the Garzas agreed to the terms of the temporary injunction, they are barred from complaining\nof any error now.

In Henke, the appellant filed an interlocutory appeal of the trial court's denial\nof his motion to dissolve a temporary injunction, arguing that the temporary injunction was void because it did not set a trial\ndate. Id. at 719. As here, the appellant had agreed to the temporary injunction at the time it was entered. Relying on the general\nrule that a party may not appeal or attack an agreed judgment, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals held that by agreeing to the\ntemporary injunction, the appellant had waived any error and had waived his right to appeal. Id. at 720.\n\n [4] [5] The Thirteenth Court of Appeals, however, failed to discuss if a party could agree to a void order. Garza argues that\nshe has not waived her rights, because the temporary injunction is void. We agree that if the temporary injunction is void, Garza\nhas not waived her rights to attack the void injunction. A void order has no force or effect and confers no rights; it is a mere\nnullity.

(not designated for publication).\n\nDespite all the above-cited case law, Trevino argues that the temporary injunction is voidable because a judgment that is\ncontrary to statute, constitutional provision, or procedural rule is merely voidable. Unlike a void judgment that is subject to\ncollateral attack, a voidable judgment has effect until challenged. Thus, a voidable judgment may become valid by failure to\ntimely challenge it by direct appeal. Because Garza did not challenge the temporary injunction by interlocutory appeal, Trevino\ncontends that the temporary injunction has now become valid.\n\nIn support of his argument that the temporary injunction is merely voidable, Trevino cites Reiss v. Reiss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2331008\"><a href=\"/opinion/2331008/reiss-v-reiss/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tex., 2003). In Reiss, the supreme court interpreted a 1980 divorce decree that divided retirement benefits stemming from one\nspouse's employment both during and after the marriage. Id. at 440. The trial court held that the language in the divorce decree\nincluded retirement benefits accrued after the marriage. Id. The former husband appealed, arguing that the divorce decree is a\nvoid judgment because the trial court that entered it did not have jurisdiction to divest him of his separate property, i.e. retirement\nbenefits accrued after the divorce. Id. at 442. Thus, the former husband contended that as a void judgment, the divorce decree\nwas subject to attack at any time. Id. The supreme court disagreed. Id.\n\nThe supreme court noted that in general, “as long as the court entering a judgment has jurisdiction of the parties and the\nsubject matter and does not act outside its capacity as a court, the judgment is not void.” Id. Thus, according to the supreme\ncourt, other than lack of jurisdiction, errors “such as a court's action contrary to a statute or statutory equivalent, merely render\nthe judgment voidable so that it may be corrected through the ordinary appellate process or other proper proceedings.” Id.\n(internal quotations omitted). Thus, Trevino argues that because Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683 was violated in this case,\nthe temporary injunction is voidable, not void, according to Reiss.\n\nFor support, Reiss cites Dubai Petroleum Co. v.

In Qwest, the supreme court reiterated the following:\n\n             The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require that an order granting a temporary injunction set the cause\n             for trial on the merits and fix the amount of security to be given by the applicant. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 683,\n             684. These procedural requirements are mandatory, and an order granting a temporary injunction that\n             does not meet them is subject to being declared void and dissolved. See InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A.\n             v. Paz Constr.

In InterFirst Bank, however, the order failed to set the case for trial on\n             the merits. Id. at 641. Yet rather than dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction, we declared the\n             temporary injunction void and ordered it dissolved. See id. We have also held that a temporary injunction\n             was void when there was no bond. See *273 Lancaster v.

Qwest, thus, clearly states that unless a temporary injunction complies with both\nrules 683 and 684, it is void. Qwest was decided after Dubai, the case relied on by the supreme court in Reiss. Thus, we must\nassume that if the supreme court believed the principles it stated in Dubai applied to temporary injunctions, it would have so\nstated in Qwest. Moreover, Reiss does not discuss temporary injunctions in any manner. We, therefore, must follow Qwest's\nholding.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

According to Trevino, “subject to being declared void” means that the order is voidable, not void. However,\nthe Qwest court made clear that a temporary injunction failing to comply with rules 683 and 684 is void. See Qwest, 24 S.W.3d\nat 337 (“[W]e declared the temporary injunction void and ordered it dissolved. We have also held that a temporary injunction\nwas void when there was no bond.”). If the supreme court had meant that such a temporary injunction was voidable, we feel\ncertain it would have used the word “voidable.” Instead, the court has repeatedly used the word “void.” See Qwest, 24 S.W.3d\nat 337; InterFirst Bank, 715 S.W.2d at 641.

(“Laredo Hix”). By two issues in its first interlocutory appeal, cause number 13-08-00294-CV, 1 Graybar\ncontends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its motion because: (1) the trial court did not have jurisdiction under\nthe Texas Property Code, see TEX.

See TEX.\nCIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 65.023 (Vernon 1997). 2 In addition, Graybar petitions this Court for a writ of mandamus,\nin cause number 13-08-00073-CV, directing the Hidalgo County district court to set aside its order denying Graybar's motion\nto abate, by which the court effectively asserts dominant jurisdiction.\n\nBy six issues, reorganized as four, Graybar alleges in its second interlocutory appeal, cause number 13-08-00341-CV, that the\ntrial court abused its discretion in granting Laredo Hix's motion to extend the original temporary injunction. 3 Graybar, MIRA\nEnterprises, Inc. (“MIRA”), and Mark Stallings Electric, Inc. (“Stallings”) also petition this Court for a writ of mandamus,\nin cause number 13-08-00333-CV, directing the Hidalgo County district court to transfer the entire case to Webb County.\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment in cause number 13-08-00294-CV; we deny Graybar's petition for writ of mandamus in\ncause number 13-08-00073-CV; we dismiss Graybar's appeal in cause number 13-08-00341-CV; and we deny Graybar's second\npetition for writ of mandamus in cause number 13-08-00333-CV.\n\n\n\n                                    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThis case centers on the management and construction of a Holiday Inn Express & Suites Hotel in Laredo, Texas. On January\n18, 2007, HMC Hospitality Operating Company (“HMC”) filed suit against Gonzalez in Collin County, asserting claims for\nbreach of contract, declaratory judgment, quantum meruit, and attorney's fees with respect to alleged breaches of various hotel\nmanagement agreements between HMC and Gonzalez pertaining to the Laredo Holiday Inn. The district court in Collin County\ntransferred the case to Hidalgo County on April 4, 2007, in response to a motion to transfer venue filed by Gonzalez.\n\n\nOn May 23, 2007, Graybar 4 perfected a mechanic's lien against the Laredo Holiday Inn and its owner, Laredo Hix, by filing its\nlien in the public records of Webb County. Graybar sought repayment for materials provided in the construction of the Laredo\nHoliday Inn in the amount of $37,788.55.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, Gonzalez filed an amended answer and counterclaim in the Hidalgo County district court denying the\nallegations made by HMC, asserting various affirmative defenses, and stating a counterclaim for fraud. Subsequently, Gonzalez\nfiled an application for a temporary restraining order and motions for temporary and permanent injunctive relief in the Hidalgo\nCounty district court, seeking to enjoin HMC from communicating with or litigating against Gonzalez.\n\n *2 On July 20, 2007, The Gonzalez-DLS Family Limited Partnership and Brownsville SB, L.P. filed an original petition in\nintervention in the Hidalgo County suit against HMC seeking declaratory relief, damages for breach of contract and fraud,\nexemplary damages, and attorney's fees pertaining to alleged material misrepresentations made by HMC to induce Gonzalez\nto enter into various hotel management agreements for four separate hotels in Pharr, McAllen, Brownsville, and Laredo. In\naddition, Ascension Hospitality Management, L.L.C. filed a petition in intervention to join in Hidalgo County suit. Furthermore,\nall parties joined in Gonzalez's application for temporary injunction.\n\nOn August 6, 2007, the Hidalgo County district court granted Gonzalez's application for temporary injunction. In its order, the\ncourt restrained HMC “from continuing to harass, threaten or communicate with the Gonzalez Group and the Gonzalez Group's\nemployees, agents, or representatives....” The court also restrained HMC “from filing, initiating, serving any process and from\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\ncontinuing any litigation against the Gonzalez Group and the Gonzalez Group's employees, agents[,] and representatives....” On\nAugust 23, 2007, HMC filed notice of its accelerated interlocutory appeal which was assigned cause number 13-07-00518-CV. 5\n\nOn September 24, 2007, Graybar filed an original petition in Webb County against Stallings, MIRA, and Laredo Hix seeking to\nforeclose on the lien it filed on May 23, 2007, asserting that the defendants had failed to timely pay balances due for materials\nfurnished for the construction of the Laredo Holiday Inn. 6 In its petition, Graybar contended that it was owed $37,788.55 for\nmaterials provided.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, Laredo Hix filed an original petition in intervention with the Hidalgo County district court. In its petition,\nLaredo Hix named sixteen parties as counter-defendants. Among the many counter-defendants were HMC, MIRA, Graybar,\nand Stallings. Laredo Hix claimed that HMC was in breach of contract, was negligent, and had breached a fiduciary duty owed\nto it. Additionally, Laredo Hix contended that Graybar, MIRA, and Stallings were in breach of contract and had negligently\ncarried out their duties in the construction of the Laredo Holiday Inn. Laredo Hix also filed an application for a temporary\nrestraining order and requests for temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent Graybar from pursuing its suit in Webb\nCounty until the Hidalgo County suit was resolved. Also on October 9, 2007, Gonzalez filed a supplemental counterclaim, an\napplication for temporary restraining order, and requests for temporary and permanent injunctions against Graybar which were\nvirtually identical to those filed by Laredo Hix. 7\n\nOn November 2, 2007, the Hidalgo County district court granted the requests for temporary injunction made by Gonzalez and\nLaredo Hix. The court specifically restrained Graybar from (1) “continuing to harass, threaten or communicate with Laredo\nHix, L.P. and/or Alvaro Gonzalez, and their employees, agents, or representatives,” and (2) “filing, initiating, serving any\nprocess, and from continuing any litigation either criminal or civil against Laredo Hix, L.P., and/or Alvaro Gonzalez, and\ntheir employees, agents and representatives, except in this Court.” The temporary injunction, which was in part an anti-suit\ninjunction, was to last until May 12, 2008, when the matter was set for trial.\n\n *3 On November 8, 2007, Graybar filed a motion to partially dissolve or modify the November 2, 2007 injunction and a\nverified plea in abatement with the Hidalgo County district court. In support of its motion, Graybar attached a copy of its original\npetition in Webb County against Stallings, MIRA, and Laredo Hix. 8 On January 2, 2008, after a hearing, the Hidalgo County\ndistrict court denied Graybar's motion and plea in abatement. Graybar perfected its appeal. 9 Graybar also filed a petition for\nwrit of mandamus on February 4, 2008, claiming that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its plea in abatement\nbecause the Webb County district court has dominant jurisdiction over all claims.\n\nAt a hearing on May 12, 2008, the Hidalgo County district court denied motions to transfer venue filed by Graybar and other\ninterested parties-namely, Harden Plumbing Company, Inc., Pete Gallegos Paving, Inc., Stallings, and MIRA-and addressed a\nmotion to compel. However, the court did not commence a trial on the merits at this time. Nevertheless, the November 2, 2007\ntemporary injunction expired. On May 20, 2008, Gonzalez and Laredo Hix filed an emergency motion to extend the November\n2, 2007 temporary injunction until November 10, 2008, when the matter was scheduled for a trial on the merits in Hidalgo\nCounty. The Hidalgo County district court granted the extension, noting that “[a]ll findings set forth in this Court's Temporary\nInjunction Order dated November 2, 2007 are incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein.” No other changes were\nmade to the temporary injunction.\n\nGraybar, MIRA, and Stallings filed a joint petition for writ of mandamus in cause number 13-08-00333-CV on May 27, 2008,\nasserting that the venue provisions of the civil practice and remedies code mandate venue in Webb County. See id. §§ 15.011,\n15.012 (Vernon 2002). In conjunction with its motion for leave of court, which we granted earlier, Graybar filed its notice of\nappeal in cause number 13-08-00341-CV on June 12, 2008.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Discussion\n\n1. Graybar's Mechanic's Lien in Webb County\nIn its first issue, Graybar asserts that the Hidalgo County district court did not have jurisdiction over its Webb County claims\npursuant to section 53.157 of the Texas Property Code. See TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 53.157(2). Specifically, Graybar\ncontends that Webb County is the only county in which its foreclosure suit can be brought and maintained because that is where\nthe property is located. On the other hand, Gonzalez and Laredo Hix argue that section 53.157 of the property code relates to\nvenue of a mechanic's lien foreclosure suit and not to subject matter jurisdiction. They further argue that the injunction issued\nby the Hidalgo County district court does not require that Graybar pursue its mechanic's lien foreclosure suit in Hidalgo County.\n\nSection 53.157 of the property code provides, in relevant part: “A mechanic's lien or affidavit claiming a mechanic's lien filed\nunder Section 53.052 may be discharged of record by ... failing to institute suit to foreclose the lien in the county in which\nthe property is located....” Id. § 53.157(2) (emphasis added). 10 Moreover, section 53.154 states that “[a] mechanic's lien may\nbe foreclosed only on judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction foreclosing the lien and ordering the sale of the property\nsubject to the lien.” Id. § 53.154 (Vernon 2007).\n\nIt is undisputed that Graybar perfected its mechanic's lien by filing an affidavit in the Webb County public records. The thrust of\nGraybar's argument pertaining to its mechanic's lien is that the Hidalgo County district court's issuance of the anti-suit injunction\nessentially forbids Graybar from foreclosing on its lien because the property code prevents it from instituting a foreclosure suit\nin Hidalgo County. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               4\n\fIn re Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\nThe part of the Hidalgo County district court's November 2, 2007 temporary injunction, which is, in effect, an anti-suit\ninjunction, provides, in relevant part:\n\n   *5 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that Counter-Defendants JUAN A. CASTILLO, GRAYBAR ELECTRIC COMPANY,\n  INC., GILBERT J. GUERRERO D/B/A RIO DELTA ENGINEERING, PETE GALLEGOS PAVING, INC., SOLORIO\n  & ASSOCIATES, MARK STALLINGS ELECTRIC, INC., and their agents, representatives, attorneys and those acting\n  in concert therewith, are hereby immediately restrained from filing, initiating, serving any process, and from continuing\n  any litigation either criminal or civil against the Laredo HIX, LP and/or Alvaro Gonzalez, and their employees, agents and\n  representatives, except in this Court.\n\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Temporary Injunction shall be valid for the remainder of this litigation until a final\n  trial on the merits shall take place at 9 a.m., May 12, 2008.\n\nWe do not find and Graybar has not directed us to, anything in the record demonstrating that the Hidalgo County district court\naffirmatively asserted jurisdiction over Graybar's suit pertaining to its mechanic's lien. The effect of the anti-suit injunction was\nmerely to abate Graybar's foreclosure suit until a trial on the merits occurred in the Hidalgo County lawsuit. 11 See Golden\nRule Ins. Co. v. Harper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768036/golden-rule-ins-co-v-harper/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651 (Tex.1996). We disagree with Graybar's contention that it has been “stripped\nof its right to bring suit to foreclose its lien.” Graybar has commenced its foreclosure suit in Webb County, and based on the\nrecord before us, there is nothing preventing Graybar from prosecuting its foreclosure suit after the Hidalgo County suit is\nresolved. Graybar has not provided any citations to authority supporting its argument that the resolution of the Hidalgo County\nlawsuit would eliminate its ability to ultimately foreclose on its mechanic's lien or that the court's injunction required Graybar\nto foreclose on its mechanic's lien in Hidalgo County. See TEX.R.APP. P. 38.1(h). Moreover, Graybar has not raised any issues\npertaining to changed circumstances. See Universal Health Servs., Inc., 24 S.W.3d at 580; Henke, 6 S.W.3d at 721. Therefore,\nwe do not find any fundamental error in the Hidalgo County district court's actions necessitating a modification or dissolution\nof the temporary injunction issued. Accordingly, we overrule Graybar's first issue.\n\n\n2. Section 65.023 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\nBy its second issue, Graybar asserts that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to issue the anti-suit injunction\npursuant to section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 65.023.\nSpecifically, Graybar argues that section 65.023 requires that any injunction must be filed in Webb County. See id. Conversely,\nGonzalez and Laredo Hix contend that section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code is not applicable because the\nHidalgo County lawsuit is not purely injunctive in nature. See id.\n\nThe principle of comity requires that courts exercise the power to enjoin foreign suits “sparingly, and only in very special\ncircumstances.” Harper, 925 S.W.2d at 651. An anti-suit injunction may be justified when the injunction will prevent a\nmultiplicity of suits or will protect a party from vexatious or harassing litigation. Christensen v. Integrity Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2409836\"><a href=\"/opinion/2409836/christensen-v-integrity-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">719</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163 (Tex.1986); see Gannon, 706 S.W.2d at 307; see also Harper, 925 S.W.2d at 651 (holding that an anti-suit injunction\nis appropriate: (1) to address a threat to the court's jurisdiction; (2) to prevent the evasion of important public policy; (3) to\nprevent a multiplicity of suits; or (4) to protect a party from vexatious or harassing litigation). The issuance of an anti-suit\ninjunction is within the sound discretion of the trial court. London Mkt. Insurers v. Am.

See TEX.\nCIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 65.023. Specifically, section 65.023, entitled “Place for Trial,” provides:\n\n  (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b), a writ of injunction against a party who is a resident of this state shall be tried in\n  a district or county court in the county in which the party is domiciled. If the writ is granted against more than one party, it\n  may be tried in the proper court of the county in which either party is domiciled.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See id. We disagree.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court, in In re Continental Airlines, interpreted section 65.023 of the civil practice and remedies code,\nthe injunction venue statute. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425004\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425004/in-re-continental-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1998) (orig.proceeding); see TEX.

Furthermore,\nthis Court has held in similar circumstances that when “[t]he injunction granted by the court below was ancillary in nature,”\nformer article 4656 does not apply. 12 Ray v. Paulus, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449-50 (Tex.Civ.App.-Corpus Christi 1972, no writ).\n\nThis case is not purely injunctive in nature. In fact, the Hidalgo County district court merely issued the injunction as a means\nto prevent a multiplicity of suits and vexatious or harassing litigation. See id. at 450; see also Harper, 925 S.W.2d at 651. In\napplying Graybar's logic, no trial court would be able to obtain subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin another court from litigating\na matter unless the enjoined court agreed to be enjoined. This contention is not supported by case law on anti-suit injunctions.\nSee Harper, 925 S.W.2d at 651; Christensen, 719 S.W.2d at 163; Gannon, 706 S.W.2d at 305.\n\n *7 In support of its contention that section 65.023 prevented the Hidalgo County district court from enjoining the Webb County\nlawsuit, Graybar relies heavily on this Court's holding in Butron v. Cantu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427839\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427839/butron-v-cantu/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94-95 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi\n1997, no writ). However, we find the Butron decision to be factually distinguishable from this case.\n\nIn Butron, a district court in Cameron County rendered a judgment against an attorney for legal malpractice. Id. at 93. In response\nto this judgment, the attorney filed an action in Hidalgo County to declare the Cameron County judgment void and later sought\na temporary injunction to prevent collection on a supersedeas bond posted with the Cameron County district court. Id. The\nHidalgo County district court subsequently issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the collection of the supersedeas bond.\nId. The issue on appeal was the propriety of the Hidalgo County district court's grant of the attorney's request for temporary\ninjunction. Id. at 94. This Court held that, since the Cameron County district court had rendered the judgment, only that court\ncould enjoin collection on the supersedeas bond. Id. at 95. There, injunctive relief was the primary relief sought by the attorney\nin Hidalgo County to “prevent [appellant] from executing on that [Cameron County] judgment.” Id. Moreover, this Court\nspecifically noted that “[s]ection 65.023 is intended to ensure that comity prevails among the various Texas trial courts because\n‘orderly procedure and proper respect for the courts will require that ... attacks upon their judgments should be made in the court\nrendering such judgment, rather than in other courts indiscriminately.’ ” Id. at 94 (quoting McVeigh v.

Here, unlike Butron, the\ntemporary injunction sought by Gonzalez and Laredo Hix in Hidalgo County was not pursued for the purpose of preventing\nGraybar from collecting on a final judgment. 13 However, most importantly, the relief sought in the case at bar is not primarily\ninjunctive in nature. The temporary injunction in the present case is merely ancillary to the primary relief sought-damages\nassociated with various causes of action, including breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, pertaining to the management\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We believe this\ncase is akin to Ray. See 489 S.W.2d at 449-50. Contrary to Graybar's assertions, Texas courts have routinely authorized the\nissuance of anti-suit injunctions to prevent a multiplicity of suits and to prevent vexatious or harassing litigation.

Graybar also claims that Gonzalez\nand Laredo Hix engaged in impermissible “forum shopping.” Gonzalez and Laredo Hix argue that: (1) Hidalgo County has\ndominant jurisdiction over the Webb County lawsuit because suit was commenced there first and the claims are interrelated;\n(2) the Webb County lawsuit has not commenced because Laredo Hix has yet to be served; and (3) Graybar has not introduced\nany evidence to support an abatement of the Hidalgo County lawsuit. 14\n\n\nA.

Moreover, Graybar acknowledges\nin its plea in abatement that the “Webb County Lawsuit is clearly inherently interrelated with the Hidalgo County Lawsuit....\nBoth have the same subject matter-the HOLIDAY INN-LAREDO.” See Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 248. Therefore, the only issue\nbefore us is which suit was filed first.\n\n *10 HMC filed its original petition with the Collin County district court on January 18, 2007, asserting various causes of\naction pertaining to an alleged breach of several hotel management agreements regarding the Laredo Holiday Inn. The lawsuit\nwas transferred to Hidalgo County on May 21, 2007. It was not until September 24, 2007, that Graybar filed its suit in Webb\nCounty to foreclose upon its mechanic's lien. Clearly, the Hidalgo County lawsuit was filed first.\n\nWhen suit is proper in more than one county, the court in which the suit is first filed acquires dominant jurisdiction. Wyatt,\n760 S.W.2d at 248. As long as the forum is proper, it is the plaintiff's privilege to choose the forum. Id. “Defendants are not\nat liberty to decline to do battle in the forum chosen by the plaintiff.” Id. Therefore, because the parties agree that the claims\nare interrelated and because the Hidalgo County lawsuit was filed first, we conclude that the Hidalgo County district court has\ndominant jurisdiction over the Webb County suit. 15\n\nGraybar, however, relies heavily on this Court's holding in San Miguel to support its contention that Webb County has dominant\njurisdiction over the involved claims. 35 S.W.3d at 703-05. In that case, San Miguel obtained a judgment against R.D. Bellows\nLaw Office (“Bellows”) for damages of $513,000 in a Harris County district court. Id. at 703. After the judgment had become\nfinal, San Miguel filed an application for ancillary relief in the Harris County district court seeking a turnover order and joining\nBellows's wife, Suzette, and the Bellows Law Firm, P.L.L.C. Id. Subsequently, Suzette and the P.L.L.C. obtained an ex parte\ntemporary restraining order in Live Oak County to prevent San Miguel from proceeding with her collection efforts in Harris\nCounty. Id. at 704. Suzette and the P.L.L.C. also filed an application for temporary injunction and a petition for declaratory\njudgment. Id. This Court concluded that the Live Oak trial court abused its discretion in issuing a temporary injunction enjoining\nSan Miguel from pursuing her collection efforts against Bellows in the Harris County trial court.

Co., Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n\n\n\n\nWe find this case to be factually distinguishable. Unlike San Miguel, Graybar has not secured a final judgment in Webb County.\nFurther, the purpose of the Hidalgo County district court's issuance of the temporary injunction and its denial of Graybar's plea\nin abatement was not to prevent Graybar from enforcing a final judgment. Additionally, as previously discussed, the claims\ninvolved are inherently interrelated and the Hidalgo County lawsuit was filed first; therefore, Hidalgo County has dominant\njurisdiction over the claims involved. Finally, the claims asserted by Suzette and the P.L.L.C. were merely injunctive in nature\nwhereas the claims asserted by Gonzalez and Laredo Hix in the Hidalgo County district court are not. See In re Continental\nAirlines, 988 S.W.2d at 736; see also In re Daniel, 2006 Tex.App. LEXIS 7207, at *7, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2361350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (suggesting that if\nthe petition includes both a plea for declaratory judgment and an injunction without any additional causes of action, then the\nprimary purpose of the suit is injunctive in nature).\n\n *11 Graybar further argues that Gonzalez and Laredo Hix are engaging in impermissible “forum shopping.” See Reliant\nEnergy, Inc., 102 S.W.3d at 875 (“Forum shopping is against public policy....”). Graybar has not cited to any authority stating\nthat the Hidalgo County district court was required to abate the Hidalgo County lawsuit for impermissible “forum shopping.”\nIn any event, our review of the record does not yield a finding that Gonzalez and Laredo Hix engaged in impermissible “forum\nshopping.” Gonzalez and Laredo Hix joined Graybar and several other counter-defendants in the underlying Hidalgo County\nlawsuit because, as Graybar admits, these claims are interrelated.\n\nIn concluding that the Hidalgo County district court has dominant jurisdiction, we do not find that Graybar's Webb County\nforeclosure lawsuit is extinguished; instead, it is merely abated pending the resolution of the Hidalgo County lawsuit. Therefore,\nbased on the foregoing, we conclude that the Hidalgo County trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Graybar's motion\nto abate. Accordingly, we deny Graybar's petition for writ of mandamus.\n\n\n\n                                           IV. CAUSE NUMBER 13-08-00341-CV\n\nIn its second interlocutory appeal, Graybar asserts that the trial court erred in granting the motion to extend the November 2,\n2007 temporary injunction filed by Gonzalez and Laredo Hix. Specifically, Graybar contends that the temporary injunction\nshould be dissolved because: (1) it does not state the court's reason for issuing the injunction; (2) it does not describe the acts\nsought to be restrained; (3) the trial court did not give Graybar an opportunity to be heard, in violation of the Due Process Clause\nof the United States Constitution, see U.S. CONST. amend. XIV; and (4) the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction\nto issue the order and Webb County has dominant jurisdiction over the remaining claims.\n\nGonzalez and Laredo Hix argue that: (1) this Court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal; (2) Graybar's alleged procedural\nviolations do not apply to extensions of temporary injunctions; (3) Graybar has already raised the issues of subject matter\njurisdiction and dominant jurisdiction in cause number 13-08-00294-CV, its first interlocutory appeal; and (4) Graybar received\n“all the process to which it was due.”\n\n\nA.

The Dallas Court of Appeals concluded that once\na final judgment was secured, under the circumstances involved, the underlying temporary injunction terminated; therefore, the\nextension of the underlying temporary injunction constituted a new temporary injunction. Id. at *14. In this case, we do not\nhave a final judgment; instead, Graybar challenges the temporary injunction on interlocutory appeal, for which our jurisdiction\nis limited. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(4). Therefore, EMC Mortgage Corp. is not applicable.\n\nIn Webb, appellant Willis Webb appealed the trial court's extension of a temporary injunction ordering him to comply with\nprovisions on a covenant not to compete with his former employer. 793 S.W.2d at 303. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals\nreviewed the mertis of the temporary injunction without any discussion as to whether the trial court's extension of the temporary\ninjunction's duration constituted a substantive modification. Id. at 305. Here, we have a unique situation in that we have reviewed\nthe merits of the temporary injunction in cause number 13-08-00294-CV, Graybar's first interlocutory appeal. The only matter\nfor review in this cause is the extension. Therefore, we find City of Lancaster to be more on point in this cause, and we decline\nto follow Webb.\n\nFinally, in Herider Farm Processing, appellant appealed the trial court's issuance of a temporary injunction enjoining the City\nof Nacogdoches from terminating water and sewer services for a period of fifteen days. 573 S.W.2d at 297. After a hearing on\nthe temporary injunction, the trial court concluded that appellant was entitled to injunctive relief and granted appellant's motion\nfor a temporary injunction for a period of fifteen days from the date of the hearing. Id. at 298. Appellant subsequently filed a\nmotion for extension of the temporary injunction “until such time as the principal suit herein may be tried to a conclusion.” Id.\nThe trial court denied appellant's motion. Id. On appeal of the temporary injunction, the court of appeals noted that the crux of\nthe disagreement between appellant and appellee pertained to the length of time for which the trial court granted or should have\ngranted the injunction. Id. The court of appeals concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in granting the injunction\nfor only a fifteen day period, reasoning that fifteen days is insufficient to preserve the status quo. Id. at 299.\n\n *13 The Herider Farm Processing case is not directly analogous to the instant case. Although it was argued that the trial court\nhad abused its discretion in denying its motion to extend the temporary injunction, the court of appeals did not analyze the\ndenial of the motion to extend the temporary injunction. Id. at 298. Instead, the court analyzed the original temporary injunction\nthat the trial court had granted. Id. at 298-99. In doing so, the court concluded that the duration of the original temporary\ninjunction was insufficient to maintain the status quo of the underlying suit, especially in light of the trial court's conclusion\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, the cases relied upon by Graybar are not persuasive in\nthis matter.\n\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that the order falls outside the ambit of section 51.014(a)(4) of the civil practice and\nremedies code, and that we do not have jurisdiction to review it. See id.; see also TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 51.014(a)\n(4). On June 10, 2008, Gonzalez and Laredo Hix moved to dismiss this appeal. Accordingly, we grant the motion to dismiss\nfiled by Gonzalez and Laredo Hix, and we dismiss this interlocutory appeal. 16\n\n\n\n                                            V. CAUSE NUMBER 13-08-00333-CV\n\n *14 In a second petition for writ of mandamus, Graybar, MIRA, and Stallings assert that the trial court abused its discretion\nin denying their motions to transfer venue. Specifically, they argue that sections 15.011 and 15.012 of the civil practice and\nremedies code are mandatory venue provisions which necessitate trying the entire case in Webb County. See TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n& REM.CODE ANN. §§ 15.011, 15.012 (Vernon 2002). Gonzalez and Laredo Hix counter by arguing that: (1) the mandatory\nvenue provisions noted by Graybar do not apply because venue in this case is governed by section 15.062 of the civil practice\nand remedies code, see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 15.062 (Vernon 2002); (2) Graybar and MIRA are barred\nfrom obtaining a writ of mandamus because of waiver; and (3) section 15.011 does not apply because the underlying suit does\nnot involve the recovery of property or quieting title, see id. § 15.011.\n\n\nA. Standard of Review\nAs previously stated, the general rule is that mandamus relief is available only to correct a “clear abuse of discretion” when there\nis no adequate remedy by appeal. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 839. However, section 15.0642 of the civil practice and remedies code\nprovides that “[a] party may apply for a writ of mandamus with an appellate court to enforce the mandatory venue provisions\nof this chapter.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 15.0642 (Vernon 2002); see id. § 15.064 (Vernon 2002) (“No\ninterlocutory appeal shall lie from the determination [of a motion to transfer venue].”). The Texas Supreme Court has held\nthat parties bringing a mandamus under section 15.0642 to enforce the mandatory venue provisions of the civil practice and\nremedies code need not demonstrate that they lack an adequate remedy by appeal.

P. 86(1).\n\n\n1. Graybar\nGraybar was first joined as a party to this matter when Laredo Hix filed its original petition in intervention and Gonzalez\nfiled his supplemental counterclaim on October 9, 2007. Graybar filed its motion to partially dissolve or modify the November\n2, 2007 temporary injunction entered by the Hidalgo County trial court and its verified plea in abatement. Subsequently, on\nNovember 20, 2007, Graybar filed its motion to transfer venue and original answer subject thereto, contending that section\n15.011 of the civil practice and remedies code mandated venue in Webb County. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN.\n§ 15.011. On March 19, 2008, Graybar filed a supplement to its November 20, 2007 motion to transfer venue, asserting that\nsection 15.012 of the civil practice and remedies code also mandated venue in Webb County. See id. § 15.012; cf. In re Pepsico,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2005577\"><a href=\"/opinion/2005577/in-re-pepsico-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2002, orig. proceeding) (“[A]n original timely motion to transfer venue may\nbe amended to cure defects in the original motion if the amended motion is filed before the trial court rules on the original\nmotion, and that the properly filed amended motion relates back to and supersedes the original motion to transfer venue.”).\nBecause Graybar filed its motion to dissolve or modify the temporary injunction and verified plea in abatement prior to its\nmotion to transfer venue, we conclude that Graybar has waived this contention. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 86(1). Therefore, Graybar\nis not entitled to mandamus relief.\n\n\n2. MIRA\n *15 In its motion to transfer venue filed on November 1, 2007, MIRA contended that Eastland County was the proper venue\nfor this matter. At no point did MIRA allege that Webb County was the proper venue. Furthermore, MIRA did not make\nreference to either sections 15.011 or 15.012 of the civil practice and remedies code in arguing that venue was not proper in\nHidalgo County. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. §§ 15.011, 15.012. Because this petition for writ of mandamus\nspecifically alleges that sections 15.011 and 15.012 mandate venue in Webb County and because MIRA did not plead those\nprovisions in its motion to transfer venue and did not assert that venue should be in Webb County, we conclude that MIRA has\nwaived its venue contention. See TEX R. CIV. P. 86(3)(b) (providing that a motion to transfer venue must “state that the action\nshould be transferred to another specified county of proper venue because.... Mandatory venue of the action in another county\nis prescribed by one or more specific statutory provisions which shall be clearly designated or indicated ”) (emphasis added);\nWilson v. Tex.

Therefore, MIRA is not entitled to mandamus relief.\n\n\n3. Stallings\nStallings filed its original motion to transfer venue on November 1, 2007, asserting that section 15.011 mandated venue in Webb\nCounty . 17 See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 15.011. Stallings filed a first amended motion on November 1, 2007,\nand a second amended motion on November 15, 2007. 18 See In re Pepsico, Inc., 87 S.W.3d at 794. In its first amended motion\nto transfer venue, Stallings specifically denied Laredo Hix's and Gonzalez's venue facts suggesting that venue was proper in\nHidalgo County, and it contended that section 15.012 also mandated venue in Webb County. See id. § 15.012. Stallings filed\na motion requesting a hearing on its motion to transfer venue on November 1, 2007. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 87(1) (providing,\namong other things, that “[t]he movant has the duty to request a setting on the motion to transfer”). The Hidalgo County trial\ncourt denied all pending motions to transfer venue after a hearing on May 12, 2008. 19\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We disagree.\n\nSection 15.011 of the civil practice and remedies code provides that:\n\n            Actions for recovery of real property or an estate or interest in real property, for partition of real property,\n            to remove encumbrances from the title to real property, for recovery of damages to real property, or to\n            quiet title to real property shall be brought in the county in which all or a party of the property is located.\n\nId. § 15.011. 20 Additionally, section 15.012 of the civil practice and remedies code provides that “[a]ctions to stay proceedings\nin a suit shall be brought in the county in which the suit is pending.” Id. § 15.012.\n\n *16 We are, however, persuaded by the reasoning in Allison v. Fire Insurance Exchange, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1794677\"><a href=\"/opinion/1794677/allison-v-fire-ins-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241-44 (Tex.App.-\nAustin 2002, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.). In Allison, the Austin Court of Appeals analyzed the applicability of section\n15.011 of the civil practice and remedies code in a case involving actions for negligence, negligence per se, breach of contract,\ndeceptive trade practices, and breach of good faith and fair dealing in insurance claims handling pertaining to water damage\nand mold contamination of an entire house. Id.; see also TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 15.011. The Allison court\nstated the following:\n\n            When considering venue, we note that the legislature's use of the word “shall” in a statute generally\n            indicates the mandatory character of the provision. Because of the mandatory nature of section 15.011,\n            we will strictly construe it and will not hold that it applies unless [appellant's] suit falls clearly within\n            one of the categories in the section.\n\nAllison, 98 S.W.3d at 241 (internal citations omitted).\n\nHere, Stallings argues that the phrase “recovery of damages of real property” encompasses the claims made by Laredo Hix\nand Gonzales; therefore, venue is mandatory in Webb County. As the Allison court properly noted, “[i]f we were to look at\nthe words ‘recovery of damages to real property’ in isolation, we would concede that the phrase may be sufficiently broad to\nencompass the expansive reading urged by [appellee]. But we do not construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes\nas a whole.” Id . at 243. Furthermore, we must look to the “true” nature of the action to determine whether section 15.011\napplies. Id. (citing Renwar Oil Corp. v.

That the phrase “for recovery of damages\n  to real property” was sandwiched between “to remove encumbrances from the title” and “to quiet title” further bolsters our\n  reading. Reading the relevant phrase in its entire context, then gives support for the more narrow interpretation.

However, Graybar raised its dominant jurisdiction issue\n       with the Hidalgo County district court in its plea in abatement. In its first petition for writ of mandamus, Graybar takes issue with\n       the propriety of the Hidalgo County district court's denial of its plea in abatement. Therefore, we will address Graybar's dominant\n       jurisdiction issue in our analysis of its entitlement to a writ of mandamus in cause number 13-08-00073-CV.\n3      On June 12, 2008, Graybar filed a motion for leave with this Court to re-file its notice of appeal in cause number 13-08-00294-CV\n       and to file its notice of appeal in cause number 13-08-00341-CV. In conjunction with issuing this memorandum opinion, we GRANT\n       Graybar's motion for leave.\n4      Graybar was the supplier of electrical materials to the construction project.\n5      On February 26, 2008, HMC Hospitality Operating Company (“HMC”) filed an unopposed motion to dismiss its appeal against\n       Gonzalez. In this motion, HMC notified this Court that the parties in the original appeal had successfully mediated their claims and\n       that it sought to dismiss its appeal and that each party would pay its own costs. This Court subsequently granted HMC's motion to\n       dismiss in cause number 13-07-00518-CV on May 13, 2008.\n6      The record reflects that MIRA was the general contractor and Stallings was an electrical subcontractor.\n7      The record contains an affidavit executed by Gonzalez stating that he is the president of Laredo Hix.\n8      On appeal, Laredo Hix contends that it was never served with notice of the Webb County suit filed by Graybar; therefore, it argues,\n       the suit cannot be considered to have commenced against it.\n9      On January 18, 2008, Graybar filed notice of its accelerated interlocutory appeal of the trial court's January 2, 2008 order, in cause\n       number 13-07-00518-CV, essentially joining in HMC's original interlocutory appeal.

See TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 53.157 (Vernon 2007). In\n       any event, Graybar has already filed suit to foreclose its mechanic's lien in Webb County. See id. § 53.158 (Vernon 2007) (providing\n       that “suit must be brought to foreclose the lien within two years after the last day a claimant may file the lien affidavit under Section\n       53.052 or within one year after completion, termination, or abandonment of the work under the original contract under which the\n       lien is claimed, whichever is later”); id. § 53 .052 (Vernon 2007) (providing that “the person claiming the lien must file an affidavit\n       with the county clerk of the county in which the property is located ... not later than the 15th day of the fourth calendar month after\n       the day on which the indebtedness accrues”).\n11     Gonzalez and Laredo Hix concede this fact on appeal.\n12     Section 65.023 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code is the successor to both former article 4656 of the Texas Revised\n       Civil Statutes and article 4653 of the “Revised Civil Statutes of Texas 1911.” Hughes v.

Specifically, Graybar argues that section 65.023 requires a party seeking\n       to enjoin pending litigation “must do so where the litigation is pending.” However, like Butron v. Cantu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427839\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427839/butron-v-cantu/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (Tex.App.-\n       Corpus Christi 1997, no writ), the Gardner and McVeigh courts concluded that attacks on a judgment must be made in the court that\n       rendered the judgment and that a party cannot seek to enjoin a party from enforcing a judgment issued in another district court. See\n       Gardner, 223 S.W.3d at 437; McVeigh, 849 S.W.2d at 914. As we have previously noted, Graybar has not secured a judgment in the\n       Webb County lawsuit. Therefore, we do not find the Gardner or McVeigh cases to be persuasive in this matter.\n14     Gonzalez and Laredo Hix also assert that Graybar is not entitled to a writ of mandamus because it already has an adequate remedy\n       at law-its interlocutory appeal. As previously noted, Graybar took issue with the Hidalgo County district court's denial of its plea\n       in abatement in its petition for writ of mandamus, not in its interlocutory appeal. Moreover, section 51.014 of the civil practice and\n       remedies code does not grant this Court interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over a denial of a plea in abatement. See TEX. CIV.\n       PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014.\n          Appeal is ordinarily an adequate remedy to review incidental rulings such as pleas in abatement. See Wyatt v.

In addition, the supreme court, in Abor v.

The\n          supreme court has not resolved these tests into one uniform test governing mandamus relief pertaining to dominant jurisdiction\n          issues. Here, the Webb County district court set a hearing for December 6, 2007, to resolve an emergency plea in abatement and a\n          motion filed by Stallings to dissolve or modify the November 2, 2007 temporary injunction. Clearly, the setting of the December\n          6, 2007 hearing date by the Webb County district court interferes with the exercise of jurisdiction by the Hidalgo County district\n          court. Under either test, Graybar does not have an adequate remedy by appeal and, therefore, it properly raised this issue in its\n          petition for writ of mandamus. See Perry, 66 S.W.3d at 258; Abor, 695 S.W.2d at 567.\n15     Though Graybar did, in fact, institute its Webb County suit before Laredo Hix's plea in intervention, we must refer to the original\n       Hidalgo County suit filed on January 18, 2007. See Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 247. This is so because Laredo Hix, through its plea in\n       intervention, effectively amended the Hidalgo County suit to join all necessary parties, and Graybar did not challenge the joinder in\n       the trial court. See id.; see also TEX.R. CIV. P. 39 (providing that a person subject to service of process shall be joined as a party if (1)\n       in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded to those already made parties or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of\n       the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in its absence may “(i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability\n       to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or\n       otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest”); R. 40 (providing that defendants may be joined in one action if\n       the assertions against them arise “out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question\n       of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action.”).\n16     Given our disposition, we need not address Graybar's remaining issues in cause number 13-08-00341-CV. See TEX.R.APP. P. 47.1.\n17     The November 1, 2007 motion to transfer venue was the first pleading filed by Stallings in the trial court; therefore, we do not have\n       for review any issues pertaining to the due order of pleading rule with respect to Stallings.

(mem.op.). Khan argues the temporary injunction orders are void because the trial court\ngranted Khan's motion for continuance and re-set the trial date to a later date than the trial dates contained in the temporary\ninjunction orders. The trial court reset the trial date for February 10, 2014. Khan asks this Court to issue a temporary stay of the\ntrial court proceedings and to issue a writ of mandamus directing the trial court (1) to vacate its order setting the show cause\nhearing, and (2) to dissolve the temporary injunctions. See Tex.R.App. P. 52.8(c); see also Tex.R.App. P. 52.10(b).\n\nAfter reviewing the petition for writ of mandamus and the mandamus record, we conclude that the relator has not established an\nabuse of discretion by the trial court.

During his confinement, Krueger filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and an emergency motion to\nset bond pending this Court's determination of the merits of the petition. We granted the emergency motion, ordered Krueger\nreleased upon the posting of bond, and requested a response from the real parties in interest, Michael Torres and Cru Energy,\nInc. (Cru Energy). A response was subsequently filed. Having considered the petition and response, we conclude that Krueger\nis entitled to relief. Accordingly, we will grant the petition for writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n                                                       BACKGROUND\n\nKrueger and Torres are opposing parties in ongoing litigation involving Cru Energy, a company that they co-founded. In the\nunderlying suit, Krueger sued Torres for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, and other theories of recovery. Torres filed\nan answer and counterclaim in which he made similar allegations against Krueger. During the course of the litigation, Torres\nsought and obtained a temporary restraining order and two temporary injunctions against Krueger. The temporary restraining\norder, which was entered on June 14, 2011, and extended by agreement on July 27, 2011, prohibited Krueger from, among\nother things, “making or initiating any withdrawals or transfers from the Wells Fargo Account (as defined in Plaintiffs' Original\nPetition), excluding transfers to be made in the ordinary course of business of Cru Energy.” 1 The first temporary injunction,\nwhich was entered on July 5, 2011, and replaced the temporary restraining order, prohibited Krueger from:\n\n\n  (1) scheduling or providing notice of or conducting a shareholder's meeting;\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Website registered in the company's name....”\n *2 On January 18, 2012, Krueger filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Texas. Subsequently, Cru Energy filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court modified\nthe stay to allow Cru Energy to pursue criminal contempt charges against Krueger relating to his obligations under the temporary\norders. On September 6, 2012, following a hearing, Krueger was held in contempt for violating the temporary restraining order\nby making three cash withdrawals on June 17, 2011, totaling $3,091.21, from the Wells Fargo Account referenced in the order.\nKrueger was subsequently committed to the Travis County Jail for three consecutive days.\n\nIn November 2012, Cru Energy pursued additional contempt charges against Krueger relating to alleged violations of the first\ntemporary injunction. Cru Energy alleged that Krueger had violated the injunction by failing to cease and desist from either\ndirectly or indirectly “making or initiating any withdrawals or transfers from any of Cru Energy, Inc. bank accounts, including,\nbut not limited to, the Wells Fargo Account as defined in Plaintiffs' Original Petition.” Specifically, according to Cru Energy,\nKrueger admitted that he had “held $80,000 in trust for Cru Energy, Inc.” and that he had “withdrew and transferred all of that\nmoney in separate violations of the Temporary Injunction.”\n\nCru Energy also alleged that Krueger had further violated the injunction by failing to cease and desist from either directly or\nindirectly “contacting any of Cru Energy Inc.'s investors or potential investors, or any other persons doing business with or\npotentially a participant in the business of Cru Energy, Inc., except as specifically authorized by Michael Torres.” According\nto Cru Energy, Krueger had contacted “multiple investors, vendors, and potential contractors and employees of Cru Energy.”\nThese alleged contacts “includ[ed] but [were] not limited to”: (1) sending an email to several investors and potential contractors\nand employees of Cru Energy; (2) contacting and ultimately contracting with DSL, a vendor of Cru Energy; (3) contacting on\nmultiple occasions Pablo Cortez and Robert Cook, both of whom were employees of Cru Energy; (4) contacting an employee\nof Seva Energie, a vendor of Cru Energy; and (5) sending an email to Dr. Patrick Hayes, “an investor and potential vendor\nor customer” of Cru Energy.\n\nA hearing was held on the allegations. At the hearing, the district court admitted into evidence the transcript of the September\ncontempt hearing (but not the documentary evidence from that hearing) and took “judicial notice of its court file.” 2 The district\ncourt proceeded to consider additional evidence regarding the allegations, including the testimony of Krueger and former Cru\nEnergy employees Cook and Cortez. Documentary evidence was also admitted relating to Krueger's allegedly improper contacts,\nincluding copies of email messages and phone logs.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The district court further found that Krueger had also violated\nthe injunction by sending an email to several investors and employees of Cru Energy, sending an email to a vendor of Cru\nEnergy, and sending emails to Pablo Cortez, an employee of Cru Energy. For each violation, the district court committed\nKrueger to jail for five consecutive days, for a total term of confinement of 125 days. Krueger was immediately taken into\ncustody and confined to the Travis County jail. 3 This habeas-corpus proceeding followed.\n\n\n\n                                          STANDARD AND SCOPE OF REVIEW\n\nContempt is “broadly defined” as “disobedience to or disrespect of a court by acting in opposition to its authority.” In re\nReece, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895325\"><a href=\"/opinion/895325/in-re-reece/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364 (Tex.2011) (orig.proceeding) (citing Ex parte Chambers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2432565\"><a href=\"/opinion/2432565/ex-parte-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259 (Tex.1995)\n(orig.proceeding)). “[C]ontempt is a broad and inherent power of a court.” Id.

First, rather than describing in reasonable detail the Wells Fargo Account, the injunction describes the account solely by\nreference to a separate document, the petition, that contains identifying information regarding the account in question. Thus, the\npetition—not the injunction—provides the means of describing the act or acts sought to be restrained. This is a violation of Rule\n683's requirement that the injunction “describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or other document,\nthe act or acts sought to be restrained.” See Tex.R. Civ. P. 683 (emphasis added).\n\nIn its brief, Cru Energy acknowledges that “[a]t best, if transfer from that [Wells Fargo] account had formed the basis of the\ncontempt finding, it may have been subject to habeas corpus for that portion of the judgment.” However, Cru Energy contends\nthat the reference in the injunction to the Wells Fargo Account was “merely an example” of an account that Krueger was\nprohibited from accessing, and it “was irrelevant to the [contempt order] because it was not the account Relator transferred the\nmoney from and for which he was held in contempt.” 4 In other words, according to Cru Energy, the only possible problem\nwith the injunction is the reference to the Wells Fargo Account, which Krueger was not alleged to have accessed. Therefore, in\nCru Energy's view, if that portion of the injunction is found to be void, it does not affect the validity of the contempt order.\n\n *7 However, Cru Energy's argument overlooks the second way in which the prohibition violates Rule 683. In addition to\nimpermissibly describing the Wells Fargo Account by reference to another document, the entire prohibition on withdrawals\nand transfers fails to describe in reasonable detail the other accounts that Krueger is enjoined from accessing. The injunction\nprohibits Krueger from making withdrawals or transfers from “any” Cru Energy bank accounts, “including but not limited to”\nthe Wells Fargo Account. But the injunction does not describe in reasonable detail those other accounts. There are no account\nnumbers listed in the injunction, no identification of the banks in which the accounts exist, and no information describing the\nhistory or current status of the accounts. Thus, even if we were to disregard the portion of the injunction that referenced the\nWells Fargo Account, the injunction still violates Rule 683's requirements that the injunction “shall be specific in terms” and\n“shall describe in reasonable detail ... the act or acts sought to be restrained.” See Tex.R. Civ. P. 683.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The injunction here, by not specifically identifying the off-limit accounts, required Krueger to make “inferences or\nconclusions about which persons might well differ” regarding the accounts he was prohibited from accessing and, consequently,\n“left for further hearing” the issue of whether withdrawals and transfers from certain accounts violated the injunction. 5 Thus,\nthe injunction failed to comply with the specificity requirements of Rule 683.

Walton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120563/computek-computer-office-supplies-inc-v-walton/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222–23 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005, no pet.) (holding that lack of specificity in injunction was not cured\nby any knowledge that enjoined party may have had).\n\nWe also disagree with Cru Energy's contention that the injunction was in “the most detail possible.” The second temporary\ninjunction, which Krueger was not alleged to have violated, specifically ordered Krueger to “[r]eturn $80,000 to the Cru\nEnergy bank account number 7038038340 to said account no later than July 18, 2011,” and to “[r]efrain and desist from\ndenying or restricting Michael Torres' access to all money in Cru Energy, Inc.'s bank account number 7038038340 or any other\naccount in the name of Cru Energy, Inc. at Wells Fargo Bank for usual and customary purposes of Cru Energy, Inc.” Thus,\nthe second injunction specifically identified the relevant bank accounts, leaving no doubt as to how Krueger was to comply\nwith the injunction. The first injunction, on the other hand, contained no such specificity. To comply with Rule 683, the first\ninjunction merely needed to “describe in reasonable detail” the bank accounts that Krueger was prohibited from accessing. See\nTex.R. Civ P. 683. This was not an impracticable requirement—providing the specific bank account names and numbers would\nhave sufficed. By not providing that or similar information identifying the specific accounts that Krueger was enjoined from\naccessing, the injunction failed to comply with Rule 683.\n\n *8 We next address the prohibition against Krueger “contacting any of Cru Energy, Inc.'s investors or potential investors, or\nany other persons doing business with or potentially a participant in the business of Cru Energy, Inc., except as specifically\nauthorized by Michael Torres.” This portion of the injunction violates Rule 683 by failing to describe in reasonable detail the\nindividuals or organizations that Krueger was prohibited from contacting. Specifically, the injunction fails to name or otherwise\nidentify those who are considered “investors or potential investors” of Cru Energy, and those who are “persons doing business\nwith or potentially a participant in the business of” Cru Energy.\n\nCru Energy argues that because of Krueger's role in running the company, he is “in a position to know who were investors\nand persons doing business with Cru [Energy].” Even assuming that this is true, 6 an injunction must be as “definite, clear and\nprecise as possible ... without calling on [the enjoined party] for inferences or conclusions about which persons might well\ndiffer and without leaving anything for further hearing.” Villalobos, 208 S.W.2d at 875. The above prohibition fails to inform\nKrueger of who he is enjoined from contacting, and it requires him to infer the identity of those individuals based on his then-\nexisting knowledge of the company's operations. This is similar to the injunction in Computek, 156 S.W.3d at 221–23, that was\nheld to violate Rule 683. In that case, OEM Supplies (OEM) and the owner of Computek, Michael Williams, were opposing\nparties in litigation involving Computek's alleged use of trade secrets to form a competing company in violation of a covenant\nnot to compete. Id. at 219–20. Computek had been permanently enjoined “from doing business, or authorizing anyone else to\ndo business, with any OEM client not listed on Attachment A or that was a new account set up while Williams worked for\nOEM.” Id. at 221. Although Attachment A listed some clients whom Computek could contact, the injunction did not name or\notherwise identify the clients whom Computek could not contact. Id. Computek contended that due to this lack of specificity, it\ncould not know whether contacting certain clients violated the injunction. Id. at 221–22. The appeals court agreed, explaining\nits reasoning as follows:\n\n\n  [T]hese paragraphs [of the injunction] enjoin Computek from taking specific actions involving specific OEM clients who are\n  not identified or listed in the permanent injunction, and from using or disclosing information and files that are not specifically\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because these OEM clients are not specifically named, we agree with Computek that\n    it must ask every non-ABBA contact it makes whether it was an OEM client during the relevant times, and that question may\n    be construed as “canvassing” or “soliciting,” and thus a violation of the permanent injunction. We agree with Computek that\n    the permanent injunction lacks specificity in this regard.\n     *9 Id. at 222. In response to OEM's argument that Computek “ha[d] the information as to the clients it may not contact ‘as\n    demonstrated by their repeated contacts of those clients,’ “ the appeals court observed,\n\n      [E]ven if the trial court had expressly found Computek had such information, rule 683 provides that the order granting an\n      injunction “shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail and not\n      by reference to the complaint or any other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained.” Thus, the injunction itself\n      must provide the specific information as to the off-limits clients, without inferences or conclusions, or, in this case, implied\n      references to other records Computek might have. Thus, we cannot agree with OEM that the lack of specificity as to OEM\n      clients is cured by any knowledge Computek may have outside the permanent injunction.\n\n  Id. at 222–23. Similarly, in this case, the injunction does not identify the individuals who Krueger is prohibited from\n  contacting, and it requires Krueger to make inferences or conclusions concerning whom those individuals are. In fact, this\n  injunction is even more vague than the injunction at issue in Computek, which at least provided a list of specific clients who\n  Computek could contact. See id. at 221. Krueger was not specifically informed of either whom he was allowed to contact\n  or whom he was enjoined from contacting.\nFor the above reasons, we conclude that the first temporary injunction violates the specificity requirements of Rule 683 and is,\naccordingly, void. 7 Consequently, the order finding Krueger in contempt for allegedly violating that injunction is also void.\nSee Shaffer, 649 S.W.2d at 301–02; In re Garza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1623664\"><a href=\"/opinion/1623664/in-re-garza/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2003, orig. proceeding). It is\ntherefore unnecessary for us to address the other reasons why, in Krueger's view, the contempt order is void. See Gordon, 584\nS.W .2d at 689–90; Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273 n. 4. We grant Krueger's petition for writ of habeas corpus, vacate the district\ncourt's contempt order, and order Krueger discharged from custody and released from the bond set by this Court on December\n31, 2012.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      The “Wells Fargo Account” is described in Krueger's petition as follows:\n              The Board authorized a checking/banking account for CRU Energy with Wells Fargo Bank (the “Wells Fargo Account”). The\n              Board resolution authorizing the Wells Fargo Account provides that Mr. Krueger and Mr. Torres would both be authorized\n              signatories on the Wells Fargo Account.\n           Although no identifying account number was provided in the petition, the “Wells Fargo Account” was referenced multiple times\n           in the petition and formed the basis for Krueger's conversion theory against Torres. Krueger pled,\n              On or about October 1, 2010, Mr. Krueger attempted to electronically access the Wells Fargo Account. Mr. Krueger was able to\n              view the Wells Fargo Account, but was unable to conduct any transactions in it. When Mr. Krueger asked Mr. Torres about his\n              inability to access the Wells Fargo Account, he informed Mr. Krueger that he had Mr. Krueger's signature authority on the Wells\n              Fargo Account revoked. Mr. Torres said that he believed having too many persons with access to the Wells Fargo Account was\n              not consistent with how he wanted to handle CRU Energy's accounting functions.\n2       The record reflects that most of the evidence concerning the alleged withdrawals and transfers was admitted during the September\n        hearing.\n3       Krueger was confined from December 19, 2012, when he was taken into custody, through December 31, 2012, when this Court\n        ordered him released upon the posting of bond.\n4       We note that the contempt order did not specifically identify the account from which Krueger had transferred money in violation\n        of the injunction, other than as “the bank account holding Cru Energy, Inc. funds.” The record reflects that there was more than\n        one such account.\n5       The record of the September 6 contempt hearing reflects this problem. At the hearing, Krueger testified that at one point he withdrew\n        $160,000 from a Cru Energy bank account and transferred the funds into his personal account, which, Krueger claimed, was “linked”\n        to a Cru Energy bank account. He later withdrew $56,000 of those funds from his personal account and transferred the funds\n        into another account that, according to Krueger, was an “operating Cru Energy account” that he had opened at Bank of America\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

At another point in his testimony, Krueger admitted to withdrawing $80,000 from “a\n      Cru Energy bank account,” but claimed that the trial court “didn't specifically say that I wouldn't have access to that account.”\n      Without specificity in the injunction, questions remain as to which particular accounts qualify as “Cru Energy, Inc. bank accounts”\n      for purposes of the injunction. For example, was Krueger's personal account considered a “Cru Energy, Inc. bank account” at the\n      time it contained $160,000 of Cru Energy funds? Similarly, was the Bank of America account, which Krueger testified he had opened\n      without authorization from Torres, actually a “Cru Energy, Inc. bank account” or, due to the lack of authorization, was it another one\n      of Krueger's personal accounts? Such questions can be answered only by drawing inferences and conclusions based on information\n      not contained within the injunction.\n6     There is some authority for the proposition that, at least in the context of covenants not to compete, injunctions generally restraining\n      solicitation of customers and not specifically listing the individual customers are not impermissibly vague.

This is because, in that context, it is not “unreasonable to\n      assume that he who is sought to be enjoined is sufficiently familiar with the employer's business and its customers to avoid violating\n      the injunction.” Id. This case presents a different situation. First, Krueger is prohibited from contacting not merely current investors\n      and persons currently doing business with Cru Energy, but also “potential” investors and “potential” participants in the business.\n      Additionally, despite whatever role Krueger may have had in Cru Energy in the past, the record reflects that during the ongoing\n      litigation, Michael Torres has been making business decisions for the company, and there is no indication in the record that Torres\n      has notified Krueger of whom Torres might be soliciting to become an “investor or potential investor in” Cru Energy, or of whom\n      Torres might be considering to become “a person doing business with or potentially a participant in the business of” Cru Energy.\n      Thus, it would not be reasonable on the facts of this case to assume that Krueger is sufficiently familiar with Cru Energy's investors,\n      potential investors, and “any other persons doing business with or potentially a participant in the business of” Cru Energy, to avoid\n      violating the injunction.\n7     In its brief, Cru Energy asserts that if there is a lack of specificity in the injunction, the defect would render the injunction merely\n      voidable (and therefore subject to attack only on direct appeal) as opposed to void. We disagree. The Texas Supreme Court has\n      repeatedly stated that an injunction that fails to strictly comply with the requirements of Rule 683 and other rules of civil procedure\n      is subject to being declared void.

The first case was assigned to the 197th District Court, Migdalia Lopez, J., but the plaintiffs successfully moved\nto transfer and consolidate all cases to the 404th District Court, Abel Limas, J., and some defendants thereafter successfully move\nto transfer and consolidate all cases in the 197th District Court. The 103rd District Court, Menton Murray, Jr., J., transferred\nto the 197th District Court. The 138th District Court, Robert Garza, J., entered an anti-transfer order. The 357th District Court,\nLeonel Alejandro, J., recused and transferred to the 107th District Court, Benjamin Euresti, J., which took no further action.\nThe 404th District Court, Abel Limas, J., rescinded its consolidation order and blocked any transfer of the case originally filed\nin that court.

Bryant & Associates, P.C., Houston, for Real Parties.\n\nOpinion\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\nTen silicosis cases involving hundreds of plaintiffs were filed in Cameron County and randomly assigned to six different courts.\nAt the behest of different parties, three judges issued conflicting orders asserting jurisdiction over cases in their own courts or\nothers. Because the Cameron County local rules permit a unilateral transfer only by the court where the first case was filed, we\nconditionally grant a writ of mandamus directing the others to vacate orders forbidding that transfer.\n\nOn May 30, 2003, a single attorney filed ten silicosis lawsuits in Cameron County. The allegations in each were identical, as\nwere the 82 defendants. Only the plaintiffs varied—each suit included about 70, for a total of almost 700.\n\nThe cases were randomly assigned among the six district courts in Cameron County. Though all were file-stamped with the\nsame time, consecutive cause numbers indicate the first case filed was assigned to the 197th District Court (Judge Migdalia\nLopez presiding).\n\nThereafter ensued a scramble for possession. First on the field were the plaintiffs, who kicked things off by moving to transfer\nand consolidate all ten cases in the 404th District Court (Judge Abel Limas presiding). That motion was granted on January 6th.\n\nClose behind came some of the defendants, who countered by moving to consolidate all ten cases in the 197th District Court,\nwhere the first case was filed. That motion, too, was granted on January 7th.\n\nThe reaction of the remaining courts varied. The 103rd District Court (Judge Menton Murray, Jr. presiding) took the second\noption, lateraling cases to the 197th District Court. The 138th District Court (Judge Robert Garza presiding) blocked, entering\nan anti-transfer order because no one had requested his consent. The 357th District Court (Judge Leonel Alejandro presiding)\npunted, signing a recusal order and transferring cases to the local administrative judge. That court, the 107th District Court\n(Judge Benjamin Euresti presiding), remained on the sidelines, taking neither offensive nor defensive action in the proceedings.\n\nAt this point, some of the contestants reversed field. Judge Limas rescinded his original consolidation order, but also signed an\norder blocking any transfer of the case originally filed in his court. Eventually, the plaintiffs followed suit, seeking to return all\ncases to the courts where originally filed, except for those transferred by recusal from the 357th.\n\n [1] Unable to determine the winner of these jurisdictional contests, the relators sought mandamus relief from the Thirteenth\nCourt of Appeals. That court declined to referee, holding the proper umpire was the local administrative judge. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1466922\"><a href=\"/opinion/1466922/in-re-amfels-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n814.

While the local administrative judge may transfer cases pursuant to local rules, enforcing or\noverruling competing orders is the duty of a higher court.\n\n*438 [2] In this case, the Cameron County rules allow transfer of related cases to the court in which filing was first made\nwithout the consent of any other judge:\n\n             Whenever any pending case is so related to another case previously filed in or disposed of by another\n             District Court of Cameron County that a transfer of the later case to such other court would facilitate\n             orderly and efficient disposition of the litigation, the Judge of the court in which the earlier case is or\n             was pending may, on notice and hearing, transfer the later case to such court.\n\nCameron County Civ.Ct. R. 1.1(f)(2). The local rules permit the first-filed case to be transferred to a court with a later-filed\ncase, but only with the first judge's consent:\n\n             In the event that an assigned case is subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1.1(f)(2) and (3) and the\n             earlier case is still pending, the judge of the court wherein the later case is pending may on notice and\n             hearing order the earlier case transferred to the later court provided that the judge of the court wherein\n             the earlier case is assigned consents.\n\nId. at 1.1(f)(5). Under these rules, only the 197th court could transfer cases unilaterally.\n\nAs the relators challenge only the conflicting transfer orders, the propriety of consolidating such a large number of claims is\nnot before us.

On appeal, InterFirst complained that the trial court's injunction order is\nvoid because it does not include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits. Finding no abuse of discretion in the trial\ncourt's decision to grant the temporary injunction, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court of appeals\nconcluded the trial court's failure to include an order setting the matter for trial on the merits did not mandate a dissolution\nof the injunction.\n\nRule 683 provides in pertinent part as follows:\n\n             *641 Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on\n            the merits with respect to the ultimate relief sought.\n\n\n [1] [2] The requirements of Rule 683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed.

The court of appeals held that it did. Honeycutt v. K-Mart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788763\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788763/honeycutt-v-kmart-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1999). We\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the expert because none of his opinions would assist the\ntrier-of-fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact issue. We therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment and\nrender judgment that the Honeycutts take nothing from K–Mart.\n\nLisa Honeycutt injured her back while shopping at a K–Mart store in Portland, Texas. She was waiting in line to check out at\nthe register next to the cart corral when the injury occurred. The cart corral, where K–Mart stores empty shopping carts, usually\nconsists of two horizontal rails intersecting a series of vertical posts; however, a part of the upper rail was missing. While in\nline, Honeycutt sat on the lower rail where the top rail was missing with her back to the shopping carts.\n\nAs Honeycutt was sitting on the lower rail, Linda Robledo, a service desk supervisor and twelve-and-a-half-year employee,\npushed several shopping carts into the cart corral. Robledo saw Honeycutt quickly stand up. Robledo was unable to see\nHoneycutt because Honeycutt was hunched over with her elbows on her knees and Robledo's view was totally or partially\nobscured by the carts already in the corral.\n\nLisa and Michael Honeycutt sued K–Mart for injuries to Lisa's back allegedly caused from being hit by the shopping carts. The\nHoneycutts hired Dr. Way Johnston as a human factors and safety expert. During discovery, Johnston entered the K–Mart store\nwithout notifying K–Mart. In his report, Johnston offered the following five opinions: (i) the lack of a top rail presented an\nunreasonable risk of injury to shoppers and employees of K–Mart; (ii) the accident would not have occurred but for the lack of\na top rail; (iii) Linda Robledo was not properly trained in pushing shopping carts; (iv) Linda Robledo failed to keep a proper\nlookout while pushing the shopping carts into the cart corral; and, (v) Lisa Honeycutt was not contributorily negligent.\n\nBefore trial, K–Mart moved to exclude Johnston from testifying. K–Mart argued that Johnston did not satisfy the requirements\nof Texas Rule of Evidence 702 because his opinions were not relevant and reliable and were within the average juror's common\nknowledge. K–Mart also argued that the trial court should exclude Johnston's testimony because his unauthorized inspection of\nthe store violated former Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 167. The trial court denied the motion. During trial, K–Mart reasserted\nits motion, which the trial court granted without specifying *360 the grounds. The Honeycutts made a bill of exceptions.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                            3\n\fK-Mart Corp. v.

The jury answered that both K–Mart and Honeycutt were negligent and attributed eighty-percent of the\nfault to Honeycutt. As a result, the trial court rendered a take-nothing judgment against the Honeycutts.\n\nThe Honeycutts appealed. The court of appeals initially affirmed the judgment. But on rehearing, it reversed the trial court\nand remanded the case for a new trial. 1 S.W.3d at 245.

It failed to consider whether Johnston's opinions\nwere beyond the average juror's common knowledge.\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] That a witness has knowledge, skill, expertise, or training does not necessarily mean that the witness can\nassist the trier-of-fact.

Johnston's first and fifth\nopinions concern the ultimate issues of K–Mart and Honeycutt's negligence. Johnston asserts that the lack of a top railing created\nan unreasonable risk because it served as an invitation for people to sit on the lower railing. Johnston's training and experience\nas a human factors expert informed him that when human *361 beings encounter a low railing, they will sit there. This same\nreasoning compelled his conclusion that Honeycutt's sitting on the lower railing was not unreasonable conduct. The jury did not\nneed Johnston's assistance to determine whether the lack of a top railing was unreasonable. The jury viewed photographs of the\ncart corral from which it could draw its own conclusions. This case is similar to Scott, in which the Fourth Circuit held that it\nwas error to allow a human factors expert to testify that defects in a sidewalk curb created an unreasonably dangerous condition\nfor women wearing high heels. 789 F.2d at 1055. The Fourth Circuit concluded that it would have been of little help to the jury\nbecause the jurors were able to observe the accident scene for themselves and reach a conclusion about the dangerousness of the\ncondition. Id. In this case, the jury's collective common sense could ably assist it in determining whether people would likely\nsit on the lower railing. See id.

His second opinion is that the lack of a top railing caused Honeycutt's injuries. This is not a causation\nissue that requires a scientific or technical explanation. It was within the jury's ability to determine on its own whether the lack\nof a railing caused the accident. Johnston's third opinion is that Robledo did not receive proper training for pushing shopping\ncarts. The jurors in this case did not need assistance in determining whether Robledo knew how to properly push shopping\ncarts. An expert opinion on how to push a shopping cart would not have aided the jury in deciding the ultimate fact issues in\nthis case. His fourth opinion is that Robledo did not keep a proper lookout while pushing the carts into the corral. The jury did\nnot need any special interpretation of the facts for it to determine whether Robledo was negligent.\n\nThus, all of Johnston's conclusions would tell the jury how they should view the facts.

The clerk has refused to forward the applications and record\non direct orders of the justices of the court of appeals.\n\nRelators Mapco, Inc., Mapco Underground Storage of Texas, Inc., and other aligned parties appealed the trial court judgment\nagainst them to the Ninth Court of Appeals. The case was argued June 15, 1989. At that time the three justices who heard the\ncase were Chief Justice Martin Dies and Justices Burgess and Brookshire. On August 31, 1989, Chief Justice Dies retired, and\non September 1, 1989, Chief Justice Ronald L. Walker assumed the bench as the appointed successor.\n\nOn November 16, 1989, the court of appeals issued its opinions and judgment. Justice Burgess wrote the “majority” opinion,\nwhich reversed the trial court judgment and remanded the cause; Justice Brookshire dissented. The written judgment of the\ncourt conforms to the “majority” opinion disposition. At the end of the court's opinions this notation appears: “Panel of Dies,\nC.J., Brookshire, J., Burgess, J. [Next Line:] Walker, C.J., not sitting.”\n\nOn November 30, 1989, the appellees (the “Carter parties”) filed their motion for rehearing. The final point of the motion for\nrehearing specifically alleged as error the improper court of appeals panel issue. Appellees argued that after his resignation\nChief Justice Dies was not authorized to participate in the decision, and that without his concurrence the decision was one-\nto-one, in violation of sections 22.216(i) and 22.222 of the Texas Government Code. 1 On December 7, 1989, the court of\nappeals overruled the motion for rehearing. There is no notation concerning which justices participated in the overruling of\nthe motion for rehearing.\n\nOn December 21, 1989, the appellees filed with the court of appeals clerk what they styled “Appellees Motion for\nReconsideration, or Alternatively, for Opinion.” This “motion” re-urged two points that had been in the motion for rehearing,\nparticularly the panel issue. It urged that the opinion and judgment on their face did not show concurrence of a majority of the\nonly “panel” that could have been sitting when the judgment was rendered, that the judgment was “void or voidable” for that\nreason, and that the court should at least issue a new opinion addressing the panel question.\n\nOn January 4, 1990, the court of appeals through its clerk issued a letter stating appellee's motion for reconsideration was\ngranted, directing re-briefing and setting the case for re-argument. On January 8, 1990, appellees filed their application for writ\nof error with the court of appeals clerk with a cover letter stating it was\n\n  to be filed * * * pursuant to Rule 130(b) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. This Application is submitted for filing\n  subject to the Order of the Court of Appeals dated January 4, 1990 granting Appellees' Motion for Reconsideration, *702\n  or Alternatively, For Opinion and ordering the subject Appeal to be reargued and rebriefed by the parties.\n\n  It is our position that the decision and judgment rendered by the Court on November 16, 1989 was void or voidable based\n  upon the lack of participation in the Judgment and Opinion rendered by a majority of the panel sitting on the Court at the time\n  of rendition of said Judgment and, therefore, did not commence the running of the time in which Appellees may file their\n  Application for Writ of Error. However, in an abundance of caution, Appellees submit the enclosed Application for Writ\n  of Error in order to present their Points of Error to the Supreme Court on a timely basis in the event said void or voidable\n  Judgment and Opinion did commence the running of the time in which Appellees may file their Application for Writ of Error.\n\nWithin ten days the Mapco parties filed their conditional application for writ of error. Thereafter, the Mapco parties wrote the\ncourt of appeals clerk requesting that the applications and records be forwarded to the supreme court.

We address two of these, to clarify holdings of this court.\n\n [4] [5] [6] The Carter parties argue that the court of appeals' plenary jurisdiction to vacate its judgment continued into\nthe next term because the motion for reconsideration was “pending” when the term ended December 31, 1989. The appellate\nrules authorize a second or subsequent motion for rehearing only if the court of appeals modifies its judgment or opinion in\nconnection with the overruling of a previous motion. Tex.R.App.P. 100(d). A second motion for rehearing not authorized by\nthe rules is a nullity even if the court of appeals rules on it. Honeycutt v. Doss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1773294\"><a href=\"/opinion/1773294/honeycutt-v-doss/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1966). Necessarily such\na motion did not extend the court of appeals' plenary jurisdiction over the judgment in the case.\n\nThe second argument is that the court of appeals' judgment was “void” because it was contrary to section 22.222(c) of the\nGovernment Code. In fact a corresponding provision appears in the constitution:\n\n   *703 The Court of Appeals may sit in sections as authorized by law. The concurrence of a majority of the judges sitting\n  in a section is necessary to decide a case.\n\n  Tex. Const. art. V, § 6.\n\nIt is also true that in Freeman v. Freeman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418256\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418256/freeman-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (1959), this court stated, “Judgments are\nvoid for lack of power in courts to render them when they are rendered contrary to constitutional or valid statutory prohibition\nor outside limiting constitutional or statutory authority.” Given only this language from Freeman, the Carter parties' argument\nis reasonably plausible that the court of appeals judgment was “void” as contrary to the “statutory prohibition” that a majority of\na panel must concur to render a decision, or beyond the authority of the court because the constitution requires the concurrence\nof a majority of a “section” of the court of appeals.\n\n [7] [8] In fact, the argument does not withstand closer scrutiny. We have spent considerable effort distinguishing and\nexplaining the quoted language from Freeman in holdings that a court's action contrary to a statute or statutory equivalent means\nthe action is erroneous or “voidable,” not that the ordinary appellate or other direct procedures to correct it may be circumvented.\nFor example, in El Paso Pipe and Supply Co. v. Mountain States Leasing, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1739209\"><a href=\"/opinion/1739209/el-paso-pipe-and-supply-co-v-mountain-states-leasing/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1981), we expressly\ndistinguished Freeman and held that conflict with then rule 329b, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, although a mandatory rule\ndealing with the trial court's plenary power, did not make the judgment “void”; the error had to be corrected through the ordinary\nappellate process or other proper proceedings. Again, in Middleton v. Murff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1625161\"><a href=\"/opinion/1625161/middleton-v-murff/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (Tex.1985), we expressly\ndisapproved the quoted statement from Freeman to the extent it was construed to mean that “[i]f a judgment rendered by a trial\ncourt is void it may be set aside by that court at any time.” We further explained it was only a trial court judgment rendered\nwithout “jurisdictional power” in the sense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction that could be set aside by the trial court at\nany time.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Murff failed to make it clear, we now expressly disapprove the quoted language from Freeman to\nthe extent it is construed to apply to a court of appeals' plenary power. Absent one of those rare circumstances that makes the\njudgment “void,” the mere fact that an action by a court of appeals is contrary to a statute, constitutional provision or rule of civil\nor appellate procedure makes it “voidable” or erroneous. A judgment is void only when it is apparent that the court rendering\nthe judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties, no jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the judgment, or\nno capacity to act as a court.

PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 51.014(4) (Vernon Supp.2000) (authorizing interlocutory appeal\nfrom an order granting a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction). In five issues, appellants contend generally that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion by dissolving the temporary injunction because: (1) the trial court did not conduct an evidentiary\nhearing; (2) appellee failed to prove a change in circumstances; (3) the trial court refused to consider the evidence adduced at\nthe hearing on the motion to grant the temporary injunction when considering appellee's motion for summary judgment; (4)\nthe trial court erred by striking appellants' summary judgment proof; and (5) the dissolution was based on *876 an improper\nsummary judgment. We reverse the trial court's order dissolving the temporary injunction and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                            Factual and Procedural Background\n\nThe underlying lawsuit involves a 1982 lease-purchase agreement between appellants and appellee. Under the terms of the\nagreement, appellants leased appellee's house for one year and were to purchase the home for $240,000 on or before expiration\nof the lease. The agreement provided that when appellants purchased the home, seventy-five percent of the rental payments\nwould be applied to reduce the purchase price. Appellants, however, were unable to obtain financing, and at the end of the\none-year lease, the parties executed an addendum to the contract. The addendum provided that the closing date for purchase\nwas to be changed from on or before March 31, 1984 to on or before January 15, 1985. The addendum also provided that after\nMarch 31, 1984, the rental payments would no longer be applied to either the down payment or taken off of the purchase price.\nAgain, appellants were unable to close on the house, and in January 1985, appellee agreed, by letter, to extend the agreement for\nanother year. The letter provided that except for the closing date, “all other terms and conditions of the original lease-purchase\nagreement will remain the same.” Thereafter, until 1998, appellee agreed each year to extend the closing date. In 1998, appellee\nrefused to extend the closing date, notified appellants that the lease-purchase agreement had expired, and offered to sell the\nproperty to appellants for the original purchase price of $240,000.\n\nAppellants acknowledged that the agreement had expired. However, they offered to purchase the home for $65,975.06.\nAccording to appellants, the 1984 addendum to the original agreement only applied for that year, and when appellee agreed to\nextend the agreement in 1985 and thereafter, the original terms of the lease-purchase agreement were in effect. Thus, according\nto appellants, seventy-five percent of the rental payments from 1985 through 1998 should be applied to reduce the purchase\nprice of the home.\n\nWhen appellee disagreed, appellants sued him for breach of contract, specific performance, declaratory judgment, statutory\nand common law fraud, and attorneys' fees. At the same time, appellants requested a temporary injunction allowing them to\nremain in the house while the suit progressed. Appellee counterclaimed, alleging, among other things, that appellants breached\nthe contract and owed him for unpaid rentals.

The trial court also\nfound appellants would suffer immediate and irreparable harm. Therefore, the trial court granted appellants' application for\na temporary injunction enjoining appellee from selling the property or any act attempting to dispossess appellants from the\nproperty. The parties did not appeal the order granting the temporary injunction.\n\n [1] [2] Subsequently, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw on all of appellants' claims. Although appellee did not file a separate motion to dissolve the temporary injunction, the motion\nfor summary judgment contained a section arguing that “to the extent [the trial court] rules favorably on [appellee]'s motion\nfor summary judgment, [appellee] is entitled to dissolution of the [temporary] injunction.” Appellee did not seek summary\njudgment on his counterclaims. *877 1 After considering the evidence in support of the summary judgment, but without an\nevidentiary hearing on the motion to dissolve the temporary injunction, the trial court ordered that “[appellants] take nothing as\nto their claims of [appellee]” and further ordered the temporary injunction dissolved. This interlocutory appeal from the portion\nof the trial court's order dissolving the temporary injunction followed.\n\n\n\n                                                           Discussion\n\n [3] [4] When, as here, the interlocutory appeal is from an order granting a motion to dissolve, and the initial order granting\ntemporary injunctive relief was not appealed, we do not consider the propriety of the trial court's decision granting the initial\ninjunctive relief.

See Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 836. The purpose is not to\ngive an unsuccessful party an opportunity to relitigate the propriety of the original grant. Id. When, as in this case, changed\ncircumstances are the basis of a motion to dissolve, the moving party must show some substantial change has occurred since\nthe proper issuance of the temporary injunction such that the order should be dissolved.

We dismiss appellants' third, fourth, and fifth issues.\n\nIn appellants' first and second issues, appellants contend the trial court abused its discretion by granting appellee's motion to\ndissolve because the trial court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing and appellee failed to prove a change in circumstances. 2\nIn essence, appellants argue that the trial court's interlocutory summary judgment alone is not a proper basis to support the\ntrial court's discretion in dissolving the temporary injunction. The parties agree, and the record supports, that the trial court\ngranted appellee's motion to dissolve the temporary injunction solely on the basis of its ruling on appellee's motion for summary\njudgment. We must decide, therefore, whether the trial court's interlocutory summary judgment is a change in circumstances\nthat would support the dissolution of the temporary injunction.\n\n [11] [12] [13] [14] The trial court unquestionably has the authority to dissolve a temporary injunction upon a showing of\nchanged circumstances. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 834. In our view, a “change in circumstances” refers to a change in conditions\noccurring since the granting of the temporary injunction. Changed circumstances may include an agreement of the parties,\nnewly revealed facts, or a change in the law that make the temporary injunction unnecessary or improper. Cf. Desai, 813 S.W.2d\nat 641–42 (dissolution of temporary injunction where appellees showed they had been effectively excluded from participation\nin operation and management of company); see also City of Tyler v.

Here, the “change in circumstances” alleged in appellee's motion\nwas not newly revealed facts or a change in the law; rather, the “change” was merely an interlocutory judicial determination\nof the merits of appellants' claims against appellee. The trial court's summary judgment did not reach appellee's claims against\nappellants and the trial court did not order any severance of the parties' claims. We conclude the trial court's interlocutory\nruling on the merits of appellants' claims is not, in and of itself, a “change in circumstances” authorizing dissolution of the\ntrial court's otherwise properly granted temporary injunction. 3 Given this conclusion, we still *879 must determine whether\nthe trial court, after it properly granted the temporary injunction, could have dissolved it absent any changed circumstances.\nWe conclude it could not.\n\nWe recognize that in Tober, the Austin court of appeals, relying on City of Hudson v. Ivie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1566339\"><a href=\"/opinion/1566339/city-of-hudson-v-ivie/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Civ.App.-\nBeaumont 1979, no writ), stated that a trial court has the authority to reverse its prior temporary injunction order absent a\nshowing of changed circumstances. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835. The procedural posture of this case, however, is different from\nIvie. In Ivie, the trial court granted a temporary injunction after an evidentiary hearing. Five days later, after a non-evidentiary\nhearing, the trial court granted the defendant's motion to dissolve the injunction. On the same day, the trial court dismissed\nthe entire proceeding. The court of appeals determined that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the case after\nholding only a preliminary hearing. However, it affirmed the trial court's order dissolving the injunction because it “read the\nstatement of facts containing the evidence offered at the [temporary injunction] hearing and [could] not conclude that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in dissolving the temporary injunction which had been improvidently granted a few days earlier.”\nIvie, 592 S.W.2d at 659–60.\n\nIn Ivie, unlike in this case where the time to review the order granting the temporary injunction has expired, the court of appeals\nhad jurisdiction to review the propriety of the trial court's decision to grant the temporary injunction. The court of appeals'\ndetermination that the trial court had the authority to dissolve its previously granted temporary injunction was, in reality, a\ndetermination that the temporary injunction had been improperly granted. Such is not the case here. We do not have jurisdiction\nto consider the propriety of the trial court's decision to grant the temporary injunction. Rather, we must presume the trial court's\ninitial decision to grant the temporary injunction was proper. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 834. Because we must recognize the\ntrial court properly granted the temporary injunction, we conclude that, absent changed circumstances, the temporary injunction\nshould remain in effect until a final disposition of the parties' claims.\n\n [15] Our conclusion is directly supported by the very nature of this appeal. The sole basis for granting appellee's motion\nto dissolve the temporary injunction was the trial court's interlocutory ruling on the merits of appellants' claims.

If we were to conclude that the trial court's interlocutory summary\njudgment is, in and of itself, an appropriate basis for the trial court's dissolution of its otherwise properly granted temporary\ninjunction, appellants could obtain a meaningful, interlocutory review of the dissolution order only through our review of\nthe merits of the interlocutory summary judgment, which we clearly cannot do. We are of the opinion that, absent changed\ncircumstances, a determination of the parties' claims should serve as the basis for dissolution of a temporary injunction only\nupon final adjudication. At that time, the temporary injunction becomes moot. See Isuani v.

After the LaFrances sued Padilla, his insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,\nassumed *456 defense of the claims. The parties subsequently engaged in settlement negotiations and, as discussed below,\nvigorously dispute whether an enforceable settlement agreement was consummated.\n\nOn April 10, 1991, Jeffrey Steidley, the LaFrances' attorney, mailed a settlement demand to Brian Chandler, Padilla's attorney,\nproviding in pertinent part as follows:\n\n  Dear Mr. Chandler:\n\n  You are quite familiar with the facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced matter. At this time we make\n  demand for policy limits of $40,000.00 for full and final settlement of this case against the insured that you represent.

I look forward to receipt\n  of the checks on or before date specified, failing which this offer to settle will be withdrawn and my clients will proceed to\n  perfect their rights under Texas law, the substance of which I know you are well aware.\n\nChandler forwarded this letter to Phil Bradshaw, the State Farm adjuster handling the claim, who telephoned Steidley's office\non April 15 and spoke with Sherea Carry. 1 Bradshaw informed Carry of an outstanding $1,600 medical lien for treatment to\nMichelle LaFrance that needed to be cleared up in connection with the settlement. Carry responded that she would have Steidley\ncall Bradshaw to discuss the lien. When Bradshaw did not hear back from Steidley, he called Steidley's office on April 18 and\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Each time he was able to speak only with Carry, who informed Bradshaw\nthat the lien had not yet been resolved.\n\nWhen Bradshaw still had not heard from Steidley by the afternoon of April 23, the settlement deadline, he faxed this handwritten\nletter to Steidley:\n\n  Dear Mr. Steidley,\n\n  This will confirm our settlement agreement of 4/18/91, whereby State Farm agreed to meet the policy limit demands set out\n  in your letter of 4/10/91. The only thing holding up resolution of this is the hospital lien re: Michelle. I await word from you\n  regarding the lien so I know to whom to make drafts payable.\n\nIt is unclear from the record what Bradshaw was referring to by the “agreement of 4/18/91.” Steidley responded before 5:00\np.m. the same day, by fax and regular mail, with this letter:\n\n  Dear Mr. Bradshaw:\n\n  This letter will confirm that the above referenced matter has been settled for all applicable policy limits, which have been\n  represented to us to be $40,000.00. Please forward settlement checks in the above referenced matter. This office will agreed\n  [sic] to take care of the lien filed by Medical Center Hospital out of the settlement funds forwarded by your office.\n\n  Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.\n\nBradshaw did not see Steidley's response until he arrived at his office the next morning, April 24. Approximately one week\nlater, Chandler tendered two settlement checks for $20,000 each to Steidley, along with a formal settlement agreement. Steidley,\nhowever, refused to accept the checks or sign the agreement, contending that Padilla had not *457 timely accepted the April\n10 settlement offer. 2\n\nPadilla subsequently filed Steidley's April 23 letter with the court, describing it as “an acceptance of a settlement.” Padilla then\nfiled a counterclaim in the pending suit, seeking enforcement of the alleged settlement agreement, and both sides moved for\nsummary judgment on the counterclaim. Padilla argued that the letters between the parties' representatives constituted a written\nsettlement agreement. Although acknowledging that the court could not render a consent judgment incorporating the terms of\nthe settlement, as the LaFrances had revoked consent, he nonetheless contended that the court could enforce the settlement\nby summary judgment. The LaFrances countered that the parties did not have an enforceable agreement under Texas Rule of\nCivil Procedure 11, which requires agreements regarding pending suits to “be in writing, signed and filed with the papers as\npart of the record....” The LaFrances further argued that, even if an otherwise valid Rule 11 agreement existed, it could not\nbe enforced since the LaFrances had revoked consent prior to any judgment being rendered on the agreement. The LaFrances\nalso moved to sever the counterclaim.\n\nAfter a hearing on May 1, 1992, the court orally ruled that an enforceable settlement agreement did not exist, granting the\nLaFrances' motion for summary judgment and denying Padilla's. The court also granted the motion for severance, noting on\nthe docket that a final judgment would be granted to the LaFrances on the counterclaim. The court, however, did not sign a\nwritten judgment or order of severance at that time.\n\nOn June 11, 1992, Padilla filed a “Motion for Reconsideration on his Motion for Summary Judgment,” raising the same\narguments contained in his original motion for summary judgment and adding one additional argument. 3 Although this motion\nwas apparently set for oral hearing on June 22, 4 there is no indication in the record or the briefs that any hearing occurred.\nOn June 19, Padilla filed another motion, styled simply as a “Motion for Summary Judgment,” setting forth essentially the\nsame arguments contained in the motion for reconsideration. No oral hearing was held on this subsequent motion for summary\njudgment, and neither it nor the motion for reconsideration was submitted for a ruling on Harris County's submission docket.

On October 19, 1992, the court signed an order granting the LaFrances'\nmotion for summary judgment and denying Padilla's. This order referred only to the cross motions for summary judgment argued\non May 1, mentioning neither Padilla's motion for reconsideration nor his later successive motion for summary judgment. 5\nOn November 20, 1992, the court signed an order severing Padilla's counterclaim and assigning it a new cause number, thus\nfinalizing the earlier summary judgment.\n\nPadilla appealed from this severed cause. The LaFrances moved the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal, contending that the\ntranscript, which Padilla filed 82 days after the judgment became final on November 20, 1992, was untimely. Under Texas Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 54(a), the transcript must be filed within sixty days after judgment, or within 120 days if a timely motion\n *458 for new trial or motion to modify the judgment has been filed. The court of appeals originally dismissed the appeal, but\nreinstated it on rehearing. The court concluded that Padilla's motion for rehearing of the trial court's oral summary judgment\nruling was the equivalent of a motion for new trial, extending the appellate deadlines under Rule 54(a). 875 S.W.2d at 732.\n\nAs to the merits, the court of appeals concluded that the parties did not have an enforceable settlement agreement under Texas\nRule of Civil Procedure 11. The court held that, under Rule 11, consent to the settlement agreement must exist at the time it is\nfiled with the court. 875 S.W.2d at 734. Although not expressly deciding whether Steidley's April 23 letter constituted a signed\nwriting sufficient under Rule 11, the court noted that the LaFrances had revoked any consent prior to that letter being filed with\nthe court. Id. The court accordingly affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of the LaFrances.\n\n\n\n                                                                 II\n\n[1]   We initially address the LaFrances' jurisdictional argument. They contend by cross-point that the court of appeals should\nhave dismissed the appeal because Padilla failed to timely file the transcript. 6 We disagree.\n\nAn appellant must file the transcript in the court of appeals “within sixty days after the judgment is signed, or, if a timely motion\nfor new trial or to modify the judgment has been filed by any party, ... within one hundred twenty days after the judgment\nis signed.” Tex.R.App.P. 54(a). Padilla filed the transcript 82 days after the judgment became final and appealable through\nseverance. 7 The issue, therefore, is whether Padilla timely filed a motion for new trial or a motion to modify the judgment.\n\nA motion for new trial “shall be filed prior to or within thirty days after the judgment or other order complained of is signed.”\nTex.R.Civ.P. 329b(a). A motion to modify the judgment must be filed within this same time period. Tex.R.Civ.P. 329b(g).\nMoreover, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 306c directs that a motion for new trial filed before judgment “shall be deemed to have\nbeen filed on the date of but subsequent to the time of signing of the judgment the motion assails....” We conclude that, under\nthe authority of these rules, Padilla's June 11 motion for reconsideration was the equivalent of a motion to modify the judgment,\nextending the appellate deadlines. These rules prevent the procedural trap that otherwise could occur if a party prematurely\nfiled a motion that was intended to assail the final judgment. See, e.g., Syn–Labs, Inc. v.

Although Padilla's motion for reconsideration was premature,\nit clearly assailed the court's final judgment. It thus qualifies as a premature motion to modify the judgment, extending the\nappellate timetable.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Even\nif this holding is correct, an issue we do not decide, it does not support the LaFrances' position here. To fall within this rule,\nPadilla's June 19 motion for summary judgment would have to be considered an amended or substituted version of his motion\nfor reconsideration. However, the June 19 summary judgment motion was not styled as an amended motion to reconsider, and\nit did not directly assail the trial court's earlier ruling, as did the motion for reconsideration. Further, if the later motion for\nsummary judgment was actually an amendment to the motion for reconsideration, as the LaFrances seem to argue, it likewise\nwould operate to extend the appellate timetable. Although we do not decide whether the later motion for summary judgment,\nfiled after the trial court's oral rendition of judgment, in and of itself extended the appellate timetable, under the circumstances\nof this case this filing cannot negate the effect of the earlier motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe LaFrances also point out that Padilla's motion for reconsideration was filed under the original, rather than the severed, cause\nnumber. They note that the trial court's later written severance order designated certain documents to be included in the record\nof the severed counterclaim, but did not include the motion for reconsideration, and Padilla never requested that the severance\norder be supplemented or modified. Because the motion for reconsideration was never actually filed under the severed cause\nnumber, the LaFrances contend that it cannot be considered in this appeal from the severed cause.\n\nThis argument is without merit. At the time Padilla filed the motion for reconsideration, there was no severed cause number, as\nthe trial court had not yet signed a written order of severance. Further, the trial court's order granting summary judgment, which\nis the order Padilla's motion for reconsideration assailed, was also filed under the original cause number, as it likewise preceded\nthe order of severance. After the trial court subsequently signed the order of severance, finalizing the summary judgment,\nPadilla filed a request for transcript under the severed cause number requesting that numerous pleadings, including his motion\nfor reconsideration, be included in the appellate transcript. The transcript before us from the severed cause accordingly includes\nthe motion for reconsideration. Under these circumstances, the motion for reconsideration operated to extend the appellate\ntimetable in the severed cause. See McRoberts v. Ryals, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429701\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429701/mcroberts-v-ryals/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454–55 (Tex.1993); Mueller v.

A settlement agreement must comply with Rule 11 to be enforceable. Kennedy, 682\nS.W.2d at 528. 8\n\nThe LaFrances argue that 1) the writings in this case do not evidence a binding agreement, 2) even if there was an agreement,\nit did not comply with Rule 11 because the LaFrances withdrew their consent before the writings were filed with the court, and\n3) any agreement was further unenforceable because the LaFrances withdrew their consent before judgment was rendered on\nthe agreement. We consider each of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n\n                                                                   A\n\n [2] [3] Rule 11 requires settlement agreements to “be in writing.” Although we have never articulated what is necessary\nto satisfy this “in writing” requirement, we may analogize to the statute of frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in\nwriting. See Tex.Bus. & Com.Code § 26.01. To satisfy the statute of frauds, “there must be a written memorandum which is\ncomplete within itself in every material detail, and which contains all of the essential elements of the agreement, so that the\ncontract can be ascertained from the writings without resorting to oral testimony.” Cohen v. McCutchin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427717\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427717/cohen-v-mccutchin/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232\n(Tex.1978). The written memorandum, however, need not be contained in one document. See Adams v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1503239\"><a href=\"/opinion/1503239/adams-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1952).\n\n [4] [5] [6] These principles apply equally to Rule 11 agreements. Applying them here, we hold that the series of letters\nbetween Steidley, Bradshaw and Chandler are sufficient to constitute an agreement in writing satisfying Rule 11. Steidley's\ninitial letter to Chandler offered to settle the case for the $40,000 policy limits, making clear that the offer could only be accepted\nby payment of the money by a specific deadline. It is undisputed that Padilla did not tender the $40,000 within that deadline.\nWhere an offer prescribes the time and manner of acceptance, those terms must ordinarily be complied with to create a contract.\nSee Town of Lindsay v. Cooke County Elec. Cooperative Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2448807\"><a href=\"/opinion/2448807/town-of-lindsay-v-cooke-county-electric-co-op-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 118 (Tex.1973), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, a different method of acceptance may be effectual where the “original offeror\nthereafter manifests his assent to the other party.” Id. That was the case here. The later writings reflect that Steidley agreed to\na modification of the terms of acceptance set out in the original letter.\n\nBradshaw's letter—faxed to Steidley on the afternoon of April 23—agreed to pay the $40,000 policy limits, specifically\nconfirming a “settlement agreement” between the parties. That letter, however, noted uncertainty as to one detail, payment\nof the hospital lien, and requested guidance from Steidley. Steidley responded that same day with a letter indicating that\nplaintiffs would pay the hospital lien out of the settlement funds, specifically stating that “[t]his letter will confirm that the above\nreferenced matter has been settled for all applicable policy limits....” (emphasis added). Steidley used this language, indicating\na consummated settlement, notwithstanding that no checks had not yet been forwarded by Padilla. Steidley, therefore, assented\nto Padilla's alteration of the mode of acceptance set out in Steidley's original offer. Rather than requiring actual payment by a\nparticular deadline, Steidley accepted Padilla's agreement to pay the policy limits as acceptance of his earlier offer. Moreover,\n *461 the letters reflect all material terms of the agreement; i.e., Padilla agreed to pay $40,000 in settlement of all claims,\nand the LaFrances agreed to be pay the hospital lien out of those proceeds. We accordingly hold that the parties entered into a\nbinding settlement agreement, evidenced by a writing sufficient to satisfy Rule 11. 9\n\n\n\n                                                                   B\n\n [7] Rule 11 requires settlement agreements to be filed “with the papers as part of the record.” Padilla did not file any of\nthe settlement letters until after the LaFrances had refused to accept the settlement checks tendered by Padilla.

As noted by the dissent below, “[t]o require the parties to immediately rush to the courthouse with\na signed document in order to quickly comply with the requirements of Rule 11 before the other party reneges on his agreement\ngoes against the grain of the policy in Texas jurisprudence which favors the settlement of lawsuits.” 875 S.W.2d at 735. The\npurpose of the filing requirement, in the language of Birdwell v. Cox, is to put the agreement before the court so that “the court\ncan judge of [its] import, and proceed to act upon [it] with safety.” 18 Tex. at 537. This purpose is satisfied so long as the\nagreement is filed before it is sought to be enforced. Padilla met that requirement here by filing each of the settlement letters\nwith his motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim.\n\n\n\n                                                                 C\n\nFinally, the LaFrances argue that the settlement is unenforceable because they withdrew consent before judgment was rendered\non the agreement. The LaFrances rely on Kennedy v. Hyde, where we held that “notwithstanding a valid Rule 11 agreement,\nconsent must exist at the time an agreed judgment is rendered.” 682 S.W.2d at 528.

Although a court cannot render a valid agreed judgment absent consent at the time it is rendered, this does not\npreclude the court, after proper notice and hearing, from enforcing a settlement agreement complying with Rule 11 even though\none side no longer consents to the settlement. The judgment in the latter case is not an agreed judgment, but rather is a judgment\nenforcing a binding contract.\n\nIn Burnaman, for example, the plaintiff wanted to repudiate a settlement that her attorney had agreed to on the record in open\ncourt, claiming that she had not authorized such settlement. Although aware of the plaintiff's objection, the court subsequently\nrendered a consent judgment incorporating the terms of the settlement. We held that the consent judgment was improper since\ncontemporaneous consent was lacking. “It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto may at one\ntime have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the\ncourt.” *462 240 S.W.2d at 291. In reversing the agreed judgment, however, we noted as follows:\n\n            Since the judgment of the trial court is reversed, we cannot pass on the effect of the agreement made by\n            the attorneys or the notation of that agreement on the docket. We can only say that the announcement\n            of the agreement in open court and its notation on the docket cannot give it the force of a judgment. It\n            follows that the reversal of the judgment should be without prejudice to the right of defendants to plead\n            the agreement in bar of plaintiff's suit and without prejudice also to plaintiff's right to avoid the agreement\n            by pleading that her attorney was without authority to make it. These are issues to be settled by the jury\n            or the court in a trial of the case.\n\n240 S.W.2d at 292. Similarly in Quintero v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1514141\"><a href=\"/opinion/1514141/quintero-v-jim-walter-homes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1983), we held that the trial court\nerred by rendering an agreed judgment of dismissal based on a release signed by plaintiff because plaintiff did not consent to the\njudgment at the time it was rendered.

In this case, for example, Padilla filed a counterclaim seeking\nenforcement of the parties' agreement, and both sides moved for summary judgment on that claim. As previously discussed,\nthe summary judgment evidence established an enforceable settlement agreement as a matter of law.

Hyde, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2461036\"><a href=\"/opinion/2461036/kennedy-v-hyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1984), I would agree that the settlement agreement in this case is enforceable\nas a binding contract between the parties regardless of whether it is ever filed as a Rule 11 agreement. Kennedy, however,\nengrafted the Rule 11 requirements on the substantive principles of contract law. In my view, Kennedy, unless overruled,\ncompels us to conclude that the settlement agreement in this case is unenforceable because, although the agreement is otherwise\nenforceable as a binding contract, it did not comport with the requirements of Rule 11 at the time Padilla sought to enforce\nthe agreement. I respectfully dissent.\n\nIn Kennedy, the parties reached an oral settlement agreement. The agreement was reduced to writing and signed by all but\none defendant, Kennedy. The plaintiffs amended their pleadings to enforce the oral settlement agreement against Kennedy.\nKennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 526. This Court reversed the judgment of the courts below enforcing the oral settlement agreement,\nholding that the oral settlement agreement was unenforceable under Rule 11 because the agreement was not in writing and\nsigned by Kennedy. Id. at 530.\n\nI begin by noting that Kennedy represents a significant departure from our Rule 11 jurisprudence and substantive contract law.\nPrior to Kennedy, this Court never held that to be enforceable as a contract, a settlement agreement must comply with Rule 11.\nIn *463 Williams v.

The implication, if any, is neither strong nor persuasive. In Williams, the Court only held that\na valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one of the parties is lacking. Williams, 568 S.W.2d\nat 131. Because one party was not present or represented by counsel at the time an agreed judgment was rendered, that party\nhad not consented to the agreed judgment. Id. at 132.\n\nThe reliance on Vickrey is even more dubious. In that case, the Court in a per curiam opinion simply recited in its statement\nof the facts that a settlement was dictated in open court pursuant to Rule 11. Vickrey, 532 S.W.2d at 292. One party appealed\nthe judgment that had been rendered based on the dictated settlement on the grounds that it did not conform to the settlement\nthat had been reached between the parties. Id. at 292. The Court reversed the judgment holding that a final judgment based on\na settlement agreement must be in “strict or literal compliance” with that agreement. Id. Like the issue in Williams, the issue in\nVickrey was whether the trial court had the power to render the judgment it did based on the settlement, not whether a settlement\nagreement is an otherwise enforceable settlement agreement absent compliance with Rule 11.\n\nBy reaching out to render settlement agreements subject to Rule 11, the Court engrafted new requirements onto the substantive\nlaw of contracts, thus exceeding the Court's rule-making authority. TEX.GOV'T CODE § 22.004. Section 22.004(a) grants this\nCourt the full authority to make rules for practice and procedure in civil actions, “except that its rules may not abridge, enlarge,\nor modify the substantive rights of a litigant.” Id. § 22.004(a).

Kennedy,\n682 S.W.2d at 529. The Legislature's failure to disapprove of Rule 11, according to the Court, may be viewed as signifying\nits acquiescence in the Court's interpretations of Rule 11's predecessors. While this may be true, it is only true if the Court's\ninterpretations of Rule 11's predecessors have subjected otherwise enforceable settlement agreements to Rule 11 and rendered\nsuch contracts unenforceable for failure to comply with the rule. None of the Court's prior interpretations have so held.\n\nNor is such an interpretation “presaged” by the Court's earlier interpretations in Birdwell v. Cox, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1857) or Matthews\nv.

See Kennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 529. Birdwell simply involved an agreement\nto postpone trial until some depositions could be taken. Birdwell, 18 Tex. at 535–36. In Matthews, the parties in a will contest\nreached a settlement but before judgment, disputes arose concerning the terms of the settlement between the parties. Matthews,\n123 S.W.2d at 871–72. Although the Court noted that the agreement had not been reduced to writing or rendered of record with\nthe trial court, the Court held that the trial court lacked authority to enter a judgment because the terms were in dispute. Id. at\n873. In other words, the parties had not consented to the terms of the settlement at the time they sought a judgment. Matthews\nsimply stands for the correct proposition that a judgment may not be rendered based on a settlement if a party withdraws its\nconsent prior to the judgment. Neither Birdwell nor Matthews justify the Court's action in Kennedy.\n\nWhile I believe Kennedy is wrongly decided, it is the law and should either be followed or overruled in this case. My criticism\nof the Court is that it does neither. Assuming the *464 Court continues to adhere to the holding in Kennedy, Rule 11 requires\nthat three conditions be met before an agreement will be enforceable: (1) a writing, (2) that is signed, (3) and that has been\nfiled with the court. London Market Cos. v. Schattman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1681879\"><a href=\"/opinion/1681879/london-market-companies-v-schattman/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552 (Tex.1991) (per curiam). Once the existence or\nterms of such an agreement becomes disputed, it is unenforceable unless it comports with all three of these requirements. Id.;\nKennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 530. Accordingly, if a purported agreement is in writing and has been signed, but becomes disputed\nbefore it has been filed with the court, the agreement is unenforceable under Rule 11. See Kennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 530 (oral\nagreement was unenforceable at the moment its existence was disputed in pleadings).\n\nRecognizing that Kennedy hangs like an albatross around its neck, the Court deals with the filing requirement of Rule 11 in\nsuch a way as to, in effect, hold that an agreement need only be in writing and signed to be enforceable. According to the Court,\nthe parties need not file an agreement with the court except and until one party disputes the existence or terms of the agreement\n—filing of the document is a mere technicality. Yet the predecessor to Rule 11, Rule 47, was amended in 1877 to specifically\nrequire that agreements be filed with the court to be enforceable. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (1877). In light of this fact, there can be\nlittle justification for today's judicial revision. An amendment to a rule must be presumed to have made some change in existing\nlaw and the Court must endeavor to give some effect to the amendment. American Surety Co. v. Axtell Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3905215\"><a href=\"/opinion/4141931/american-surety-co-of-ny-v-axtell-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3905215\"><a href=\"/opinion/4141931/american-surety-co-of-ny-v-axtell-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719–20 (1931). To the contrary, the Court effectively eliminates the filing requirement from Rule 11.\n\nMoreover, the Court's construction trivializing the filing requirement arguably defeats the purposes of Rule 11. Rule 11 ensures\n(1) that agreements of counsel which affect the interest of their clients not be left to the fallibility of human recollection,\nWyss v. Bookman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569 (Tex.Comm'n App.1921, holding approved); and (2) that agreements themselves not\nbecome sources of controversy impeding resolution of suits. Kennedy, 682 S.W.2d at 530. In addition, Rule 11 also operates\nto prevent the trial judge from having to place the parties' attorneys on the stand and determine which one is telling the truth.\nSee Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. McCollum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384072\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384072/fidelity-cas-co-of-new-york-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Stated another way,\nthe significance of Rule 11 is to formalize the procedures for entering into agreements concerning a pending lawsuit so that the\ncourt can extricate itself from controversies ancillary to the underlying litigation. The filing element, if it has any purpose at\nall, surely is designed to make the parties focus on an agreement and recognize that not only have the terms of the agreement\nbeen memorialized in writing but also that they have the imprimatur of a court record. The filing requirement thus adds to the\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             10\n\fPadilla v.

Yet if we are going to continue to insist that our\nsubstantive contract law be modified by Rule 11, we should at least be consistent in our readings. To be enforced, a settlement\nagreement must be in writing, signed, and filed at the time either its existence or the terms of the agreement become disputed.\nKennedy, if correct, compels us to conclude that the agreement in this case is unenforceable because it became disputed before\nit complied with the Rule 11 filing requirement. Because the Court chooses not to address Kennedy, it takes the questionable\nroute of trivializing the filing requirement of Rule 11 to the point of nonexistence. If there is value to Rule 11's requirement\nthat an agreement be on file with the Court, then that value should not be destroyed. If there is no value to the mere filing of an\nagreement, then the Court should amend Rule 11 to delete the requirement.

Padilla relies on the requirement that a party who seeks a different and more favorable judgment in this Court than\n        that rendered by the court of appeals must file his or her own application for writ of error, rather than merely raising the argument\n        by a responsive cross-point.

The LaFrances' cross-point, however, does not seek a different and more\n        favorable judgment. Although a judgment of dismissal would be different from the actual judgment of the court of appeals affirming\n        the judgment of the trial court, the end results would be equally favorable. In either case, the trial court's summary judgment in favor\n        of the LaFrances remains undisturbed. The LaFrances were thus entitled to raise the dismissal argument by cross-point.\n7       Although the trial court signed the order granting summary judgment for the LaFrances on the settlement issue on October 19, 1992,\n        it did not sever this issue until November 20, 1992. The latter date controls the appellate timetable.\n8       Because the primary purpose of Rule 11 is to require the parties to reduce their agreements to writing, the Court in Kennedy refused\n        to enforce an oral settlement agreement.\n9       The LaFrances argue that there is no summary judgment evidence that Bradshaw, who was not an attorney, was authorized to negotiate\n        a settlement or enter a binding Rule 11 agreement on Padilla's behalf. We disagree. The record reflects that Chandler, who was\n        Padilla's attorney, was the one who forwarded the LaFrances settlement offer to Bradshaw, and it was Chandler who procured the\n        settlement checks from Bradshaw and tendered them to Steidley. Moreover, Steidley knew that Bradshaw was negotiating on behalf\n        of Padilla and that he was at least purporting to act as Padilla's agent. Under these circumstances, even if Bradshaw did not have actual\n        authority to settle the lawsuit, Padilla was entitled to ratify Bradshaw's actions, thereby creating a binding agreement. See Restatement\n        (Second) of Agency, § 87.

By the underlying suit, Diane Morgan f/k/a Diane Parham (Diane) sought to avoid a transfer of\nthe subject property as a fraudulent transfer as well as a declaration that the September 22, 2007 deed purporting to accomplish\nthe transfer is void. The trial court granted partial summary judgment on the attempted transfer, declared the deed void, signed\na final judgment awarding Diane attorney's fees, and enjoined appellants Parham Family Limited Partnership (Partnership) and\nVan E. Parham, Jr. (Van Jr.) from pursuing their collateral suit regarding the subject property.\n\nOn appeal, Parham Enterprises, Inc. (PEI) and Rhetta Parham (Rhetta), the president of PEI, urge the trial court erred by (a)\ngranting the motion for partial summary judgment, (b) enforcing an “expired” temporary injunction, and (c) awarding Diane\nattorney's fees despite a failure to segregate. Partnership and Van Jr. challenge the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over\nDiane's suit and Diane's standing to seek injunctive relief against them. Partnership and Van Jr. also assert the trial court erred\nin entering the injunction against them. As explained below, we affirm the trial court's judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n                                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\nDiane was married to Shawn Parham in June 2004. On June 22, 2004, Shawn conveyed the subject property to PEI. PEI is a\ncorporation that was owned and controlled by Van Parham, Sr. and Rhetta. Diane worked for PEI until she and Shawn were\nseparated in August 2005; they were divorced in May 2006.\n\nOn September 22, 2007, Rhetta, as president of PEI, signed a deed attempting to convey the subject property to Partnership.\nHowever, it is undisputed that the warranty deed identified the wrong lot within the Farmette Meadows Section and named\na non-existent entity, Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2, as grantee. The warranty deed, including these errors, was\nrecorded in the real property records of Harris County. In July 2008, Diane obtained a judgment against PEI for around $82,500\nin County Court at Law No. 3 related to PEI's unauthorized use of her personal credit cards. The transfer of the subject property\noccurred during the pendency of the credit card dispute. Diane attempted to execute her judgment against PEI once it became\nfinal, but was unsuccessful. She abstracted this judgment in the Harris County deed records on September 22, 2008.\n\nOn January 28, 2009, Diane, as a judgment creditor, filed a petition to set aside deed, for declaratory judgment, for fraudulent\ntransfer and for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and temporary injunction. She named PEI and Rhetta as defendants. Diane\nasserted that the September 22, 2007 deed conveying Lot 1 was a fraudulent conveyance of the subject property to a non-\nexistent entity made to “delay, hinder, or defraud” Diane in her efforts to collect that judgment. Diane sought to set aside “the\npurported transfer and an order of sale ... for disposition and satisfaction of [her] judgment,” a declaratory judgment, a TRO and\ntemporary injunction against further conveyances of the subject property, actual damages that “exceed $84,000 but are within\nthe jurisdictional limits of this court,” and attorney's fees. The trial court issued a TRO on February 2 and set the hearing on\nthe temporary injunction for February 13.\n\nOn February 13, Diane obtained a temporary injunction against PEI and Rhetta, prohibiting them from “deeding, transferring\nor conveying” Lot 1. The trial court set the matter for trial on July 15.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014)\n\n\n *778 On February 27, Van Jr. and Partnership filed a petition in intervention (mistakenly styled an “interpleader”), asserting\nan interest in the subject property. Diane filed an amended petition naming Van Parham Sr., Van Jr., Partnership, and V.E.\nParham Jr. Management Corp. as additional defendants. She also added claims for conspiracy and exemplary damages against\nall the defendants.\n\nDuring the remainder of 2009, the defendants filed and continued various dispositive motions. The parties agreed to continue\nnumerous trial settings and the parties unsuccessfully mediated. In 2010, the trial court denied all of the defendants' dispositive\nmotions, Van Sr. passed away, and Diane amended her petition to remove Van Sr. and V.E. Parham Jr. Management Corp.\nas parties and delete her claim for exemplary damages. And, the parties agreed to more continuances, moving the trial into\n2011. On September 19, 2011, Diane filed a motion for partial summary judgment against PEI only. In this motion, she sought\njudgment on her claims for declaratory judgment and for fraudulent transfer. This motion was set for submission on October 7.\nDiane attached to her motion (1) a copy of the recorded deed on the subject property, bearing the two errors in lot and grantee,\n(2) a certificate from the Texas Secretary of State certifying that there is no record of any business entity, foreign or domestic, by\nthe name of Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2, 1 and (3) evidence in support of her fraudulent transfer claim, including\nan appraisal of the subject property at the time of the purported transfer. Rhetta and PEI responded to Diane's motion for partial\nsummary judgment. Intervenors 2 Partnership and Van Jr. also filed a response to Diane's motion.\n\nLater in September, Diane filed a third amended petition restating her previous claims; and adding a claim for piercing the\ncorporate veil against Rhetta, seeking to hold her individually liable for disregarding the corporate form of PEI. A week later,\nDiane filed a “notice of disobedience of the temporary injunction,” asking the court to hold PEI and Rhetta, individually and\nas president of PEI, in contempt. In this notice, she asserted:\n\n             The Defendants [PEI] and [Rhetta] were served with the Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n             on Thursday, September 15, 2011. In a calculated bad faith attempt to defeat the partial summary\n             judgment motion, the Defendants [PEI] and [Rhetta] violated the Court's Temporary Injunction Order\n             on Friday, September 23, 2011 by filing an amended and alleged corrected Warranty Deed to the subject\n             property Lot 9 with the county clerk.\n\n\nThe trial court heard this motion on October 12. After the hearing, the trial court signed an order holding PEI and Rhetta in\ncontempt. In this order, the trial court declared the deed executed by PEI and Rhetta on September 22, 2011 (filed on September\n23) void and fined Rhetta “$500.00 as punishment for contempt” of the temporary injunction. The trial court further ordered\nPEI and Rhetta to obey the contempt order and the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction. In the order, the trial court stated\nthe temporary injunction “remains in effect for any and all purposes.” The trial court also signed *779 a trial setting that day,\nsetting the case for trial on January 23, 2012.\n\nTwo days before the hearing on Diane's motion for contempt, Diane filed a motion to strike the intervention of Partnership and\nVan Jr. At a hearing on October 19, 2011, Diane orally dropped her conspiracy claims against all the parties. The trial court\nsigned a partial non-suit with prejudice of these claims that same date. The trial court also signed an order granting Diane's\nmotion to strike the intervention of Partnership and Van Jr. According to the trial court's findings, Partnership and Van Jr. filed\na motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration in response to the trial court's order striking their intervention. 3\n\nDiane filed an amended petition on November 7 naming only PEI and Rhetta as defendants. In this petition, Diane sought to set\naside the September 22, 2007 deed, a declaratory judgment that this deed was void, and alternative relief for fraudulent transfer,\npiercing the corporate veil, and fraud. She further alleged that the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction remained in effect.\n\nOn January 17, 2012, Partnership and Van Jr. filed an action to quiet title to the subject property in Harris County Probate\nCourt No. 1, which was overseeing the probate of the estate of Van Sr. This quiet-title action was based on the September 22,\n2007 deed. On January 19, PEI and Rhetta filed a motion in the underlying cause here to transfer venue to the probate court.\nThe motion also complained that, due to the amount in controversy, the court did not have jurisdiction, and that the court had\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Although Diane responded to\nthe motion, it appears that the motion was neither set for hearing nor ruled upon.\n\nOn January 23, 2012, the trial court signed an order granting Diane's September 19 motion for partial summary judgment against\nPEI. Specifically, the trial court's order: “GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant\nParham Enterprises, Inc. regarding the issue that the warranty deed executed on September 22, 2007 is void.”\n\nThe next day, the trial court signed an order denying Partnership and Van Jr.'s motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration.\nAlso on January 24, Diane and PEI proceeded to a jury trial on the issue of attorney's fees only. 4 After a brief jury trial, the\njury returned a verdict finding Diane's reasonable and necessary attorney's fees for preparation and trial to be $75,000, for an\nappeal to the court of appeals to be $25,000, and for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas to be $15,000.\n\nFollowing the trial, Diane filed an amended petition on February 6, 2012, listing Partnership and Van Jr. as “intervenors.” In\naddition to the claims listed above that Diane had raised in her previous pleadings, she sought an anti-suit TRO and temporary\ninjunction against Partnership and Van Jr., enjoining them from pursuing their “mirror lawsuit” to quiet title. The trial court\ngranted the TRO on February 8 and set the temporary injunction for a hearing on February 20. Counsel for Partnership and Van\nJr. appeared *780 at the February 8 hearing on the TRO as “amici curiae.”\n\nDiane's February 15 motion for temporary injunction against Partnership and Van Jr. cited Texas Civil Practice & Remedies\nCode section 65.011, which provides, “A writ of injunction may be granted if a party performs or is about to perform ... an\nact relating to the subject of pending litigation, in violation of the rights of the applicant, and the act would tend to render the\njudgment in that litigation ineffectual; the applicant is entitled to a writ of injunction under the principles of equity and the\nstatutes of this state relating to injunction.” 5 She noted in this motion that “on the eve of trial,” she was served with citation\nand a copy of the intervenors' original petition for declaratory judgment in the probate court regarding the deed/title to the\nsubject property. She alleged that in this “mirror lawsuit,” Partnership and Van Jr. were attempting to re-litigate the identical\nissues regarding the deed/title to the subject property, which was the subject of “this pending litigation.” She stated that on\nJanuary 23, the trial court had signed a partial summary judgment in her favor, in which the court had issued an order that the\nSeptember 22, 2007 deed issued by PEI was void. She further noted that on January 24, 2012, the trial court signed an order\ndenying Partnership's motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration. She asserted that the trial court had jurisdiction over\nPartnership and Van Jr. because they consented to the court's jurisdiction regarding their motion for new trial, which was not\ndenied until January 24, 2012. Diane also alleged she was entitled to an anti-suit temporary injunction to address a threat to\nthe court's jurisdiction, to prevent the evasion of important public policy, to prevent a multiplicity of suits, or to protect a party\nfrom vexatious or harassing litigation, citing Bridas Corp. v. Unocal Corp. and Golden Rule Insurance v. Harper. 6\n\nPartnership and Van Jr. responded to this motion, “without waiving citation, service of process, or making a general appearance.”\nThey asserted that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case because the property in question was valued\nat over $300,000, which exceeded the jurisdictional limits of the maximum amount in controversy for statutory county courts\nin Harris County. They further claimed that, rather than maintaining the status quo, as a temporary injunction was intended\nto do, granting a temporary injunction in this case would destroy the status quo. They asserted that the probate court had now\nobtained dominant jurisdiction over their claims, which was evidenced by the need for Diane to seek leave of court to amend her\npleadings, post-jury trial and concurrently with the temporary injunction hearing. Citing United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co.\nv. Beuhler, they alleged that a plaintiff may not dismiss claims against defendants, proceed to a jury trial without them, and after\na trial on the merits, rejoin them as a party in the same case, particularly as intervenors. 7 Finally, they contended that Diane\nwas judicially estopped from obtaining injunctive relief against them because she had them struck and dismissed from the case.\n\n *781 After an evidentiary hearing on February 20, 2012, at which counsel for all parties and putative parties appeared, the\ntrial court granted the temporary injunction, as well as granting Diane leave to amend her petition. Bond was set at $1,000, and\nthe case was set for trial on the permanent injunction on June 4, 2012.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In their plea to the jurisdiction, they asserted\nthat the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the property at issue was valued above the jurisdictional limits of\nthe statutory county court at law. They also filed a verified denial, urging that there was a defect in parties—they were named as\nintervenors after their petition in intervention had been struck. They asserted that no such intervention existed and that because\nDiane had proceeded to a jury trial on the merits, she could no longer, post-trial, sue them as intervenors in an adjudicated\nmatter. Subject to several affirmative defenses, they filed a general denial.\n\n\nAlso on February 27, the trial court signed an interlocutory judgment. 8 In this interlocutory judgment, the trial court included\nthe following regarding summary judgment regarding the void deed:\n\n\n  Plaintiff Diane Morgan timely filed a motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc.\n  regarding the issue that the warranty deed attempting to transfer the title to [the subject property] was void.\n\n     On January 23, 2012, the Court, after considering the pleadings, the motion, the affidavits, the response of the Defendant,\n     the response of the Interveners, the law, and the facts, granted the Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment against\n     the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. The Order is attached as Exhibit ‘A’ and incorporated by reference.\n\n     The court hereby renders judgment for Plaintiff Diane Morgan that the warranty deed attempting to transfer title to the\n     subject property ... and executed on or about September 22, 2007 is void.\n\n   (emphasis added). This interlocutory judgment also iterated the jury verdict on fees against PEI, and the February 13, 2009\n   temporary injunction against Partnership and the February 20, 2012 temporary injunction against Partnership and Van Jr.\nAt the June 4, 2012 evidentiary hearing on the permanent injunction, counsel for Partnership and Van Jr. again raised the issue\nthat they had been brought into the case as intervenors even though their petition in intervention had been struck and Diane\nhad non-suited her claims against them:\n\n  This Court on October the 12th [2011] had a hearing. And at that hearing Diane Morgan's counsel nonsuited my clients\n  and nonsuited with prejudice. The Court signed off on an order on October 19th nonsuiting with prejudice any conspiracy\n  claims. Then what transpired is the Court in—well, actually Diane Morgan filed a fourth amended petition. And in that fourth\n  amended petition, she dropped all claims against Parham Family Limited Partnership and Dr. Van E. Parham, Jr.\n\n  The Court also struck the intervention that my clients filed back in October as well. Therefore, they ceased being parties at\n  the very latest at the beginning of November. The Court proceeded to go to trial on the merits. It was a jury *782 trial. The\n  Court granted a motion for summary judgment at the end of January prior to trial and then went right into a jury trial to which\n  the Parham Family Limited Partnership and Dr. Van E. Parham were not parties, nor were they given notice of the trial.\n\n  Your Honor, I'm not sure what—the Court granted a post-trial leave to amend for Diane Morgan in which she has sued my\n  clients as intervenors which the Court struck back in October.\n\n  Your Honor, under the Rules of Procedure, once you proceed to trial, anything that's not submitted at that point in time is\n  abandoned and under 165 that's exactly what we have here. Is Ms. Morgan asking the Court for a new trial?\n\nThe trial court responded that it had already ruled on Partnership's and Van Jr.'s motion to dismiss by denying it and asked the\nparties to proceed on the permanent injunction hearing. Both sides presented evidence and argument. On June 11, 2012, the trial\ncourt signed an order granting a permanent injunction “restraining the Interveners from prosecuting a mirror lawsuit regarding\nthe deed/title to Lot 9 in Harris County Probate court No. [1] or any other Court.”\nThe trial court signed a final judgment on August 8, 2012.

See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1). 10 Section 25.0003 of the Texas Government Code governs\nthe general jurisdiction of statutory county courts and proscribes the monetary jurisdictional limits of them. See id. § 25.0003.\nBut section 25.1032 of the Government Code contains additional jurisdictional provisions particular to Harris County civil\ncourts at law. See id. § 25.1032. Subsections 25.1032(c)(1) and (3) provide the Harris County civil courts at law jurisdiction\nto “decide the issue of title to real or personal property” and to “hear a suit for the enforcement of a lien on real property.”\nId. § 25.1032(c)(1), (3).\n\nDiane brought this suit to decide the issue of title to real property. She sought a determination of whether title to Lot 9 remained\nwith PEI or had been conveyed to another. See id. § 25.1032(c)(1). Additionally, Diane sought to enforce the judgment lien\nfrom her prior suit in County Civil Court at Law No. 3 against Lot 9 if it found the deed void. See id. § 25.1032(c)(3). Indeed,\nPartnership and Van Jr. acknowledge in their briefing that Diane is “trying to establish and determine title to real property,”\nalbeit they claim it is “regarding a sale to which she was not a party or has a justiciable interest.” The jurisdiction provided by\nsection 25.1032 is based on the subject matter of the claim, not the amount in controversy.

Thus, the allegations in her petition regarding the amount in controversy control for\njurisdictional purposes. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224 n. 4; Cont'l Coffee, 937 S.W.2d at 449. Section 25.0003(c)(1) of the Texas\nGovernment Code provides jurisdiction for statutory county courts over matters in controversy between $500 and $200,000 “as\nalleged on the face of the petition.” Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1) (emphasis added). As noted above, the jurisdictional\nmaximum amount in controversy at the time Diane filed her suit was $100,000. Diane's allegation of damages on the face of her\npetition falls below this maximum amount; thus, the trial court had jurisdiction over this matter even under the more general\nprovision of jurisdiction provided by section 25.0003. 11\n\n [4] Finally, with certain exceptions not relevant here, when jurisdiction is lawfully and properly acquired, no later fact or event\ndeprives the court of jurisdiction.

We therefore overrule Partnership's and Van Jr.'s first issue.\n\n\n2.

Under Texas law, a plaintiff has standing to bring suit if\nshe has suffered a distinct injury, and there exists a real controversy between the parties that will be determined by the judicial\ndetermination sought.

Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §\n24.005(a) (emphasis added). Thus, Partnership and Van Jr.'s argument begs the entire question of Diane's case: Is the September\n22, 2007 deed purporting to transfer the subject property void as a fraudulent conveyance or otherwise?\n\nIf the purported conveyance failed to transfer the property to Partnership, then title of the property remained with PEI, and\nDiane's judgment lien against PEI attached. Thus, Diane had a clear justiciable interest in whether her judgment lien attached to\na property she alleges was fraudulently transferred to Partnership to defeat her monetary claim against PEI; the Texas Uniform\nFraudulent Transfer Act provides that justiciable interest because she was not a party to the transaction. For the foregoing\nreasons, we overrule Partnership's and Van Jr.'s challenge to Diane's standing to bring this suit. 13\n\nHaving addressed the jurisdictional issues presented by Partnership and Van Jr., we turn to the trial court's summary *786\njudgment declaring the September 22, 2007 deed void.\n\n\nB. Validity of the Deed\nIn PEI and Rhetta's first issue, they assert that the trial court erred in declaring this deed void by traditional summary judgment\nbecause Diane failed to conclusively establish that the deed lacked the legal requisites to qualify as a deed.\n\nWe review the trial court's granting of a summary judgment de novo.

The Trial Court Grants Summary Judgment on All Bases\n [6] PEI and Rhetta argue that the trial court's summary judgment should be reversed because their evidence conclusively\nestablished the grantee's existence. They do not urge an issue concerning Diane's fraudulent transfer claim. Instead, they state\nthat the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment solely on the basis of the declaratory judgment act claim. We\ndisagree.\n\nDiane sought partial summary judgment. By her motion, Diane asked the trial court to set aside the deed and return the subject\nproperty to PEI. Diane argued both that (a) PEI failed in its attempt to transfer the subject property because the deed was\ndefective and (b) PEI violated Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act section 24.005.

When it incorporated the summary judgment order into the judgment, the trial court stated: “On\nJanuary 23, 2012, the Court, after considering the pleadings, the motion, the affidavits, the response of the Defendants, the\nresponse of the Interveners, the law, and the facts granted Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant\nParham Enterprises, Inc.”\n\nNevertheless, PEI and Rhetta urge that the motion was granted in part. They appear to rely upon a single sentence in the summary\njudgment order as a limit on the grounds for granting. Specifically, the trial court's summary judgment order also stated: “The\nGrantee, Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2, was not in existence at the time the deed was executed.” However, this\nis merely a statement of an undisputed fact. The order does not purport to resolve only the legal effect of the undisputed fact.\nInstead, the summary judgment order declares the deed void, which is precisely the relief Diane sought on both her declaratory\njudgment claim and her fraudulent transfer claim. Based upon the plain language of the order, we conclude that the trial court\ngranted Diane's motion for partial summary judgment on both her Declaratory Judgment action and her fraudulent transfer claim.\n\n*787 Further, to the extent that there was any confusion about whether the trial court granted a fraudulent transfer summary\njudgment, 14 the trial court clarified it when, at the trial on the permanent injunction, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n\n  Mr. Toups [Partnership/Van Jr.]: Your Honor, you granted a motion for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment.\n\n     The Court: They both said yes, I set it aside. So, I'm not sure why we're all on a different page.\n\n     Mr. Thomas [Diane]: You declared it void.\n\n     The Court: I declared it void. Okay. Same thing, in my mind. When I declared it void, I considered it in my mind fraudulent\n     and set it aside, hence, the declaring it void.\n\n   (emphasis added).\n [7] For PEI and Rhetta to obtain a reversal of the motion for partial summary judgment, they must attack every ground relied\non for which summary judgment could have been granted. See Malooly Bros. Inc. v. Napier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1753847\"><a href=\"/opinion/1753847/malooly-brothers-inc-v-napier/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (Tex.1970).\nWhere an appellant fails to challenge even one of the grounds, the appellate court may affirm the summary judgment on that\nground alone.

Although PEI and\nRhetta do not include an issue on appeal attacking the trial court's summary judgment on fraudulent conveyance, they argue the\nmerits of the claim in the body of their brief. Therefore, we construe the brief to adequately raise the point.\n\n\n2.

As outlined above, PEI and Rhetta do not dispute this point.\n\nInstead, PEI and Rhetta assert that a deed is not void if the grantee exists but receives the deed in an assumed name, citing\nBuist v.

Instead, PEI and Rhetta maintained *788 in the trial court that both the conveyance to\n“Parham Family Partnership No. 2” and the conveyance of Lot 1, rather than Lot 9, were “clerical errors” that properly could\nbe corrected by a “correction deed” relating back to September 22, 2007. Thus, we may not consider this argument raised for\nthe first time on appeal as a ground for reversing summary judgment.\n\nIn sum, Diane presented conclusive evidence that the deed from PEI, dated September 22, 2007, attempted to convey the subject\nproperty to a non-existent entity. “[I]n Texas, a deed is void if the grantee is not in existence at the time the deed is executed.”\nLighthouse Church of Cloverleaf, 889 S.W.2d at 600. Accordingly, Diane established as a matter of law that the September 22,\n2007 deed was void. The trial court did not err in so declaring.\n\n\n3. Fraudulent Transfer\n [11] PEI and Rhetta argue that Diane was not entitled to summary judgment on her fraudulent transfer claim because there is\na genuine issue of material fact as to both PEI's intent to fraudulently transfer the property and the reasonably equivalent value\nreceived for the property. PEI and Rhetta correctly argue that PEI's intent is an element running through several of Diane's\ntheories of fraudulent transfer. For example, section 24.005(a)(1) permits Diane to avoid the transfer if the “debtor made the\ntransfer ... with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor.” Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 24.005(a)\n(1). Alternatively, section 24.005(a)(2) permits Diane to avoid the transfer without proving PEI's intent if she establishes that\nPEI made the transfer without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer. Diane sought summary\njudgment on both subsections (1) and (2).\n\nPEI and Rhetta responded with, inter alia, the affidavit of Rhetta. She averred that she was an officer and owner of PEI on\nSeptember 22, 2007, when PEI made the subject transfer. She further stated that it was her intent to transfer the subject property\nto Partnership. Rhetta describes the conveyance and the amount paid for the subject property. Finally, Rhetta states that “[t]he\nsale of the property was done to either hinder, delay or defraud Diane Morgan fka Diane Parham.” Thus, Rhetta's affidavit\nsupplies conclusive evidence that she, on behalf of PEI, transferred the subject property with actual intent to hinder, delay,\nor default Diane as creditor in satisfaction of 24.005(a)(1). With such evidence of intent, the parties' dispute over whether the\ntransferor paid reasonably equivalent value for the property under subsection (2) became immaterial. The trial court properly\ngranted the summary judgment on the alternative basis urged.\n\nWe overrule PEI's and Rhetta's first issue.\n\n\nC. Injunctive Relief\nIn their second issue, PEI and Rhetta assert that the trial court abused its discretion in granting and enforcing a procedurally\nflawed temporary injunction and continuing it in its final judgment. Partnership and Van Jr. complain in their third issue that the\ntrial court abused its discretion in issuing a “post-trial anti-suit permanent injunction against dismissed non-parties prohibiting\nthem from prosecuting a quiet-title suit for real property.” We address each of these issues in turn.\n\n\n1.

The order at issue here does not simply\nrefer to another document; rather, it attaches the deed as an exhibit to the temporary injunction. “Rule 683 is not violated when\ndocuments are attached to the injunction and referred to it as part of the injunction because the attachments become part of the\ninjunction itself.” Layton v.

As noted above, however, there were numerous trial continuances. Further, at the hearing on Diane's motion for\ncontempt filed against PEI and Rhetta for violation of the temporary injunction, held on October 12, 2011, counsel for PEI and\nRhetta never asserted that the temporary injunction was no longer in effect. Instead, counsel asserted that their actions in filing\na correction deed did not violate the temporary injunction. In the court's order of contempt against PEI and Rhetta, the trial\ncourt stated, “The Temporary Injunction issued by this Court was effective from February 13, 2009 and while this litigation is\npending or until further order of this court ....” 15 Thus, PEI and Rhetta have not met their burden, as appellants, to establish that\nthe February 2009 temporary injunction was not still in effect until the trial court entered a judgment on the merits of Diane's\nclaim. See, e.g., Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204 (providing that the purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo\npending a trial on the merits of the litigation's subject matter). 16\n\n [15] Finally, PEI and Rhetta assert that the trial court erred by continuing the February 2009 temporary injunction in the final\njudgment of the trial court. We agree with this portion of their issue. As noted above, the purpose of a temporary injunction\nis to preserve the litigation's *790 subject matter pending a trial on the merits. Id. This purpose is not served by continuing\na temporary injunction in a final judgment; such a process effectively transforms a temporary injunction into a permanent\ninjunction without a trial.

Kaufmann, 93 S.W.3d\nat 657 (“There are at least two reasons for requiring a trial date on the [temporary injunction] order. One is to prevent the\ninjunction from becoming permanent.”). Thus, the trial court erred by continuing the February 2009 temporary injunction in\nthe final judgment.\n\nAccordingly, we sustain this portion of PEI and Rhetta's second issue and modify the trial court's judgment to remove the\nfollowing language from it:\n\n             The Court issued a Temporary Injunction against the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. on February\n             13, 2009 and restrained the Defendant from deeding, transferring or conveying all or part of the subject\n             property 18610 Tomato Street, Spring, Harris County, Texas 77379 from the date of the Order and while\n             this cause was pending or until further order of the Court. This Temporary Injunction continues against\n             the Defendant until 180 days after all appeals are completed or until further order from this Court.\n\nWe overrule this issue to the extent that it involves complaints about the temporary injunction prior to entry of the final judgment\nand the order of contempt based on it.\n\n\n2. The Permanent Anti–Suit Injunction Against Partnership and Van Jr.\nPartnership and Van Jr. assert that the trial court abused its discretion in entering a permanent “post-trial” anti-suit injunction\nagainst them because (a) they were no longer parties to the suit, (b) they had a legal right to pursue the action to quiet title in\nanother court, and (c) the anti-suit injunction lacks both a cause of action and evidentiary support.\n\nWe begin by noting what is not disputed within this issue. First, Partnership and Van Jr. do not appeal the trial court's order\nstriking their intervention. As such, Partnership and Van, Jr. do not have a justiciable interest in Diane's fraudulent transfer/\ndeclaratory judgment action. Second, Partnership and Van Jr. did not file a motion to strike Diane's post-trial, pre-judgment\namended petition naming them as intervenors and they do not appeal the trial court's grant of leave to file that petition.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

To the contrary,\nPartnership and Van Jr. participated in the hearing on the anti-suit injunction.

Co. v. Harper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768036\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768036/golden-rule-ins-co-v-harper/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651 (Tex.1996). Although there are “no precise guidelines” for reviewing an anti-suit injunction, we *791 will\nuphold an injunction issued to protect a court's dominant jurisdiction where, if the enjoined party were allowed to proceed, the\ndominant court would lose its ability to proceed with the case. See, e.g., Owens–Illinois, Inc. v. Webb, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425169\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425169/owens-illinois-inc-v-webb/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 902\n(Tex.App.—Texarkana 1991, no writ).\n\n [18] Diane supported her request for anti-suit injunction with evidence that her suit pertained to title to the subject property,\nand that she filed the suit prior to Partnership and Van Jr.'s suit to quiet title in the subject property—also a suit pertaining to\ntitle. The evidence showed that Diane, a judgment creditor, filed her suit alleging that PEI, a judgment debtor, made a fraudulent\nconveyance of the subject property. Her pleading sought to set aside “the purported transfer” of the subject property.\n\nAt the time of Diane's request for anti-suit injunction, the trial court had already granted an affirmative motion for summary\njudgment on Diane's claims and declared the September 22, 2007 deed void. The trial court had already held the attempted\ncorrection deed of September 22, 2011, void as a violation of the court's injunction. Finally, the trial court determined that\nPartnership and Van Jr.'s lawsuit regarding the “deed/title to” the subject property is a “mirror lawsuit.”\n\nPartnership and Van Jr. offer no argument about how the two suits did not or would not interfere with one another. Partnership\nand Van Jr. confine their arguments to the impairment of their rights in the subject property. As noted above, however,\nPartnership and Van Jr. have not appealed the striking of their intervention, and they offer no argument on appeal in support\nof their rights to the fraudulently transferred property. Given the trial court's unchallenged ruling that Partnership and Van Jr.\ndo not have a justiciable interest in the property, that court had the authority to enjoin them from contending otherwise in the\nprobate court. If Partnership and Van Jr. are implying that Partnership accepted the transfer in good faith and for reasonably\nequivalent value, as recognized by Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act section 24.009(a), they neglected to preserve that\nargument in these proceedings through an appeal of their justiciable interest in the property. 17 See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code\nAnn. § 24.009(a) (“A transfer or obligation is not voidable under Section 24.005(a)(1) of this code against a person who took\nin good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any subsequent transferee or obligee.”)\n\nWe therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering an anti-suit injunction to protect its jurisdiction\nover the subject property.\n\n\nD. Segregation of Attorney's Fees\n [19] In PEI's third issue, it asserts that Diane failed to segregate her attorney's fees. PEI further asserts that the appellate\nattorney's fees are not conditioned on Diane's prevailing on appeal.\n\n [20] A failure to segregate attorney's fees can result in the recovery of no such fees.

Thus, we do not address this portion\nof its issue. See id.\n\nAs to the remainder of PEI's third issue, the judgment conditions the award of appellate attorney's fees on PEI's failure on appeal:\n\n             In the event of an appeal by the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. to the court of appeals, if the appeal\n             is unsuccessful, Plaintiff Diane Morgan will be further entitled to $25,000.00 as a reasonable attorney's\n             fee; in the event of an appeal by the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. to the Supreme Court of Texas, if\n             the appeal is unsuccessful, Plaintiff Diane Morgan will be further entitled to $15,000.00 as a reasonable\n             attorney's fee.\n\nSuch an award is tantamount to conditioning it on Diane's appellate success against PEI; for Diane to succeed on appeal, PEI\nmust fail on its issues.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we overrule PEI's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                            III. CONCLUSION\n\nIn sum, we have concluded that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case and that Diane had standing to bring\nher claims. We have accordingly overruled Partnership's and Van Jr.'s first and second issues. We have further determined that\nthe trial court properly granted Diane's partial summary judgment on all bases; thus we have overruled PEI's and Rhetta's first\nissue. Further, we have overruled PEI's and Rhetta's third issue regarding segregation of attorney's fees.\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion by enforcing the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction against PEI, and we lack\njurisdiction to consider that portion of PEI's and Rhetta's complaint regarding the trial court's contempt order. However, the\ntrial court did improperly include this temporary injunction in the final judgment, and we therefore have sustained in part PEI's\nsecond issue. We modify the trial court's judgment to remove the language concerning this temporary injunction from the final\njudgment. Finally, we have concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering a permanent anti-suit injunction\nagainst Partnership and Van Jr. We thus overruled the third and final issue of Partnership and Van Jr.\n\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment as modified.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      This certificate notes that a similarly named entity, Partnership, had been identified through the Secretary of State's record search.\n2      The parties variously spell this word as “intervenor” and “intervener.” For consistency's sake, we spell it “intervenor” throughout\n        this opinion, except where it has been quoted from the record.\n3       Our record does not contain a copy of the motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration filed by Partnership and Van Jr.\n4       The reporter's record from the pretrial conference reflects that Diane non-suited her claims against Rhetta for piercing the corporate\n        veil regarding responsibility for attorney's fees. According to the trial transcript, the only issue thus remaining was Diane's attorney's\n        fees against PEI.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>       <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Giannakopoulos, a case from our sister court, for the proposition that “[w]hen a suit is for an\n      interest in real property or to foreclose a lien on real property, rather than damages, the value of the property interest at issue determines\n      the amount in controversy.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.). In Giannakopoulos, the plaintiff did\n      not contain a statement of jurisdiction or otherwise identify the amount in controversy. Id. at 622. Here, Diane's petition did contain\n      a jurisdictional statement identifying an amount in controversy. Further, the plaintiff in Giannakopoulos brought suit to partition\n      three separate but adjacent and contiguous properties, of which he owned a fifty percent interest. Id. at 619. The trial court granted\n      a partition of the properties, dividing them into two equal-sized lots and awarding one to the plaintiff. Id. at 620. Diane, on the other\n      hand, sued to have a title declared void, for fraudulent transfer, and for damages. Nowhere in her pleadings does she seek to obtain\n      an interest in the property. Thus, the analysis in Giannakopoulos is inapplicable to the facts of this case.\n12    See infra section B.3 regarding the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Diane on her fraudulent transfer claim.\n13    As discussed above, Diane initially sued PEI and Rhetta, seeking to set aside the deed and for fraudulent transfer. Partnership and Van\n      Jr. then intervened in the lawsuit asserting their interest as the purported grantee of the subject property. Diane added claims against\n      them for conspiracy, but later nonsuited those claims. Their intervention was also struck on Diane's motion; they filed a motion for\n      reconsideration/new trial. A permanent anti-suit injunction was entered against them in the trial court's final judgment, the propriety\n      of which is addressed later in this opinion.\n14    Diane does not appear to have been confused about the order. As PEI and Rhetta point out, Diane did not attempt to try the fraudulent\n      transfer claim to the court or a jury. PEI and Rhetta characterize such failure as waiver. But Diane did not need to submit this claim\n      to the jury; the trial court had already granted her summary judgment on it.\n15    PEI and Rhetta also complain about the order of contempt, signed October 12, 2011, against them based on their violation of the\n      temporary injunction. However, we lack jurisdiction to address complaints about the contempt order. See Cadle Co. v.

See TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM.CODE ANN. § 51.014(a)(4) (Vernon 2008). We hold that, while the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a\ntemporary injunction to preserve the status quo, it did abuse its discretion in crafting the temporary injunction order. We declare\nthe temporary injunction order void and dissolve the order because it is overly broad and fails to comply with Rule 683 of the\nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure. TEX.R. CIV.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n\n\n                                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nU.S. Money Reserve, Inc. d/b/a United States Rare Coin & Bullion Reserve (“U.S. Money Reserve”) filed suit against a group\nof former employees, including appellants, Chad Poole and Terry Fendley, alleging that appellants orchestrated a conspiracy\nto defraud U.S. Money Reserve and its customers. U.S. Money Reserve alleged specifically that defendants worked together\nto divert sales of coins from customers of U.S. Money Reserve and set up a scheme to abscond customer leads and divert\nsales to other defendant companies. The petition alleged that defendants received cash payments for diverting sales to the other\ncompanies. The petition sought among other remedies, a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and permanent\ninjunctive relief. The petition asserted that the acts of defendants constituted violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act as\nwell as a breach of the employment agreement signed by defendant-employees. U.S. Money Reserve further alleged tortious\ninterference with its business relationships and misappropriation of trade secrets.\n\n\nThe trial court entered a temporary injunction on February 22, 2008, preventing Poole and Fendley 1 from soliciting existing\nor potential clients of U.S. Money Reserve or otherwise engaging in any similar business in the United States through January\n25, 2011. The Temporary Injunction states in part that Poole and Fendley:\n\n\n  shall not call upon, solicit, divert, take away, and/or attempt to call upon, solicit, divert, or take away any existing or potential\n  clients, customers, suppliers, businesses, and/or accounts of U.S. Money Reserve, Inc. d/b/a United States Rare Coin &\n  Bullion Reserve (hereinafter referred to as “Company”) in connection with any business similar or related to the business in\n  the United States, nor will Defendant[s] ... interfere or compete with the Company in connection with such clients, customers,\n  suppliers, businesses, and accounts in the United States before 01/25/2011.\n  The Order further provides:\n\n     Defendant[s] ... shall not solicit the hiring of any present or future salesman or consultant of the Company before\n     01/25/2011.\n\n     Defendant[s] ... shall not engage in, or give any advice to any person, firm, partnership, associations, corporation, and/\n     or other entity engaged in a business similar to or related to the business of the Company or any portion thereof in the\n     United States before 01/25/2011.\n\n      *2 Defendant[s] ... shall not lend credit, money, or reputation for the purpose of establishing or operating a business\n     similar or related to the business of the Company or any portion thereof in the United States before 01/25/2011.\nFendley and Poole contend in three issues that the trial court abused it discretion 1) in reaching the implied finding that U.S.\nMoney Reserve had a probable right to the relief sought; 2) by entering a temporary injunction that was overbroad; and 3) in\nreaching the implied finding that U.S. Money Reserve would suffer a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury. Appellants\nargue in conjunction with their third issue that the trial court's order granting the temporary injunction is void because it fails\nto comply with Rule 683 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n                                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n“A temporary injunction is an extraordinary remedy and does not issue as a matter of right.” Butnaru v.

A trial court\n\n             abuses its discretion when it misapplies the law to established facts or when the evidence does not\n             reasonably support the trial court's determination of the existence of probable injury or probable right of\n             recovery. We review de novo any determinations on questions of law the trial court made in support of\n             its order. However, we only review the trial court's decision on the issues before the court.\n\n *3 Id. (citations omitted). We recognize that the trial court's order is “based on the record presented at the temporary injunction\nhearing.” ,Id. at 885. “We will not assume that the evidence taken at a preliminary hearing will be the same as the evidence\ndeveloped at a full trial on the merits.” Id. Thus, our review of the trial court's order is limited to whether the trial judge abused\nits discretion in granting the temporary injunction on the record before it. Id.\n\n\n\n                                         PROBABLE RIGHT TO RELIEF SOUGHT\n\n“To obtain a temporary injunction, an applicant must plead and prove three specific elements (1) a cause of action against the\ndefendant; (2) a probable right to the relief sought; and (3) a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury before trial.” Wright,\n137 S.W.3d at 292. The first element is not disputed. Appellants contend that the trial court erred in impliedly finding that a\nprobable right to relief existed and in entering the temporary injunction. Specifically, appellants contend that the covenant not\nto compete is overbroad in that it contains an industry-wide exclusion preventing appellants from calling upon or soliciting any\nexisting or potential clients within the United States and prevents appellants from engaging in any business similar to or related\nto the business of U.S. Money Reserve throughout the United States.\n\n [1] An interlocutory appeal from “an order granting or denying a temporary injunction based on a convenant not to compete\ndoes not present for appellate review the ultimate question of whether the covenant is enforceable under section 15.50 of the\n[Texas] business and commerce code.” Tom James, 109 S.W.3d at 882–83 (citing TEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 15.50\n(Vernon 2002)). We will only address the enforceability of those provisions insofar as it affects our analysis of whether the\nelements required for issuance of a temporary injunction have been satisfied. See id. at 883–85. The employment agreements\nwhich contain the covenants at issue in this lawsuit provide as follows:\n\n  15. Unauthorized Competition Prohibited. The Employee expressly agrees that the Employee shall not, for a period of\n  five (5) years after termination of the Association or employment between Employer and Employee, without prior written\n  consent of the Employer, directly or indirectly through any corporation, organization or entity owned or controlled by the\n  Employee, or as principal, agent, joint venture, employee, employer, consultant, partner, stock holder or holder of any equity\n  or security ..., in any other individual, representative or corporate capacity whatsoever:\n\n  a) Call upon, contact, solicit, divert, take away, or attempt to call upon, contact, solicit, divert or take away any existing or\n     potential clients, customers, suppliers, businesses, or accounts of the Employer in connection with any business similar\n     or related to the business within the above defined geographical area; nor will the Employee interfere with or compete\n     with the Employer in connection with such clients, customers, suppliers, businesses, and accounts in the geographical\n     area. The term client or customer as referenced in this covenant includes: (1) any clients or customers for whom\n     Employer provided services at any time during Employee's employment with Employer; and (2) any prospective clients\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This provision specifically includes existing competitors of the Employer, and any potential, future\n     competitors of Employer. This provision also specifically prohibits Employee from forming a competitive Employer or\n     organization as an owner, sole proprietor, partner, joint venturer (or in any other ownership capacity) competing against\n     Employer. Similarly, this provision specifically prohibits Employee from getting or giving any advice, knowledge or\n     information from or to any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity engaged in a business similar\n     to or related to the business of Employer or any portion thereof, within the United Kingdom, Canada or the United States.\n\n  f) It is expressly agreed, stipulated and understood by the Employee that the services of the Employer have been and are\n     currently being marketed and sold in the geographical area described above, and it is the Employer's intent to continue\n     to expand the marketability of its services and products. Accordingly, these covenants are intended to restrict the\n     Employee from competing in any manner with the Employer in the activities, which have heretofore been carried\n     on, by the Employee or any portion thereof or any activities similar or related thereto within the geographical area....\n\n(Emphasis added). 2 The geographical area is not specifically defined in the agreements of Poole and Fendley, however, at the\nhearing Poole and Dean Liepsner, C.E.O of U.S. Money Reserve, testified the geographic area encompassed the entire United\nStates. This is consistent with both the trial court's order and the terms of the restrictive covenants.\n\nAppellants contend that because the covenant contains an industry-wide exclusion it is overbroad and unenforceable and does\nnot give rise to a probable right to the relief sought. Appellants further contend that because the trial court's order implements\nthe industry-wide exclusion set forth in the restrictive covenants, it is likewise overbroad and unenforceable. While we do not\nundertake to consider the ultimate issue of whether the covenant is enforceable under current law, we hold, based on the facts\nestablished by the record, that the trial court abused its discretion in enjoining appellants from engaging in any subsequent\nemployment in that industry throughout the United States.\n\n *5 U.S. Money Reserve argues that this case is governed by Alex Sheshunoff Management Services, L.P. v.

Our analysis merits a discussion of the cases cited by both parties.\n\nSection 15.50(a) of the Texas Business & Commerce Code provides that\n\n            a covenant not to compete is enforceable if it is ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement\n            at the time the agreement is made to the extent that it contains limitations as to time, geographical area,\n            and scope of activity to be restrained that are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is\n            necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n\nAdditionally, section 15.51(b) provides that “[i]f the primary purpose of the agreement to which the covenant is ancillary is\nto obligate the promisor to render personal services, for a term or at will, the promisee has the burden of establishing that the\ncovenant meets the criteria specified by Section 15.50....” Id. § 15.51(b) (Vernon 2002).\n\nIn Haass, the Texas Supreme Court held that “a damages provision affecting the right to render personal services operates as a\nrestraint of trade and must be judged by the reasonableness standards for covenants not to compete [.]” Haass, 818 S.W.2d at\n382. The underlying dispute in Haass began with the merger of two accounting firms, CJ and MH. Id. The Court recognized\nthat the relevant reasonableness questions with respect to the contractual provision at issue were whether the restraint imposed\nby the provision was greater than required to protect MH's legitimate interests and whether MH's need outweighed the hardship\nto Haass or the damage to the public. Id. at 386. The Court in Haass found significant that the contract provisions operated\nprospectively to include clients that became clients after the departing partner had already left the firm. Id. In addition, the\nprovision also expressly included any of MH's clients worldwide, not just those with whom Haass had some actual contact.\nId. The Court stated,\n\n  These aspects of the provision the court of appeals concluded were unreasonable because they were overbroad, oppressive\n  to Haass because he “would have to, in effect, take a prospective client's accounting history,” and injurious to the public by\n  limiting the choice of accountants.\n\n  The court of appeals' conclusion is supported by decisions from other jurisdictions. The fundamental legitimate business\n  interest that may be protected by such covenants is in preventing employees or departing partners from using the business\n  contacts and rapport established during the relationship of representing the accounting firm to take the firm's customers with\n  him.\n\n*6 Id. at 386–87 (citations omitted).\n\nThe Court concluded that in the context of the accounting firm merger at the center of dispute in Haass, the protectible\nfundamental business interest included preserving the client base that MH acquired by merging with CJ. Id. at 387. The Court\nrecognized that in order to meet the reasonableness standard there should be a “connection between the personal involvement\nof the former firm member with the client.” Id. The Court stated that “[i]nhibiting departing partners from engaging accounting\nservices for clients who were acquired after the partner left, or with whom the accountant had no contact while associated with\nthe firm, does not further and is not reasonably necessary to protect” the relevant business interest. Id. at 388. Therefore, the\nCourt held the provision was “overbroad and unreasonable.” Id. Notably, Haass was not a case involving a review of the trial\ncourt's grant of a temporary injunction; however, our decision in Wright was such a case. See Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 291.\n\nIn Wright, we considered whether the trial court abused its discretion in entering a temporary injunction to enforce a covenant,\nwhich like the restrictive covenant in the present case, contained an industry-wide exclusion, prohibiting the former employee\nfrom engaging in any sales activities in any related business across several counties. See id. Specifically, the agreement\nprohibited Wright, a former salesman for Sport Supply Group, Inc. (“SSG”) from, “either directly or indirectly, conducting\nany sales related activities for a business related to the promotion, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, sourcing, importing\nand/or sale of sports related equipment and/or supplies to institutional customers” in twenty-nine counties. Wright, 137 S.W.3d\nat 291, 298. The agreement further prohibited Wright from doing business with the “customers, suppliers, clients, licensors,\nlicensees, distributors, dealers, or independent salespersons of SSG, or any [of] its affiliates” that conducted business in Wright's\nsales district. Id. at 298.\n\nIn Wright we stated that “[a] restrictive covenant is unreasonable unless it bears some relation to the activities of the employee.”\nId. (citing Haass, 818 S.W.2d at 386–87). Additionally, we recognized that “[a] covenant not to compete that contains an\nindustry-wide exclusion from subsequent employment is unenforceable.” Id. (citing John R. Ray & Sons, Inc. v. Stroman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1640285\"><a href=\"/opinion/1640285/john-r-ray-sons-inc-v-stroman/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied)). Further, we stated, “a covenant not to compete that extends\nto clients with whom a salesman had no dealings during his employment is unenforceable.” Id. We held the covenants at issue\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               6\n\fPoole v. U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\nwere unreasonable restraints of trade because they did not limit the prohibitions to customers with whom Wright had dealings\nwhile he was employed by SSG. Id. Consequently, we held that the trial court abused its discretion by granting the temporary\ninjunction. Id.\n\n *7 In Sheshunoff, the Texas Supreme Court addressed the enforceability of a restrictive covenant with no geographic restriction\nthat prohibited a former employee, Kenneth Johnson (“Johnson”) from providing consulting services to any former customers\nof his former employer, Alex Sheshunoff Management Services, L.P. (“ASM”), or from soliciting any affiliation member or\npreviously identified prospective client or affiliation member. Sheshunoff, 209 S.W.3d at 646–47. ASM provided consulting\nservices to banks and other financial institutions. Id. Johnson was the director of the company's “Affiliation Program,” a program\ndesigned to maintain relationships with clients and prospective clients. Id. A few months after being promoted to director of the\naffiliation program, Johnson signed an employment agreement, which he was told was a condition of his continued employment.\nId. The agreement provided in pertinent part:\n\n  (a) In consideration of the training and access to Confidential Information provided by Employer ... for a period of one (1)\n  year following the termination of Employee's employment for any reason, Employee will not\n\n  (i) directly or indirectly, as an owner, employee, independent contractor or otherwise, provide consulting services to banks,\n  savings and loans or other financial institutions where the Employee has provided fee based services in excess of 40 hours\n  within the last year of employment, or with which Employee has conducted significant sales activity, including, but not\n  limited to, more than one sales call, preparation of a sales proposal and actual sales, within the last year of employment.\n  This restriction applies regardless of geographic location, it being acknowledged by the parties that Employer's clients are\n  not confined to a particular geographic area;\n\n  (ii) solicit or aid any other party in soliciting any affiliation member or previously identified prospective client or affiliation\n  member; or\n\n  ....\n\n  (b) Employee understands and acknowledges that Employer has made substantial investments to develop its business interests\n  and goodwill, and to provide special training to Employee for the performance of Employee's duties under this Agreement.\n  Employee agrees that the limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained contained in this\n  Paragraph 6 are reasonable and are not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interests of Employer.\n\nId. at 656.\n\nASM brought an action to enforce the agreement after Johnson left and went to a competitor, Strunk & Associates, L.P.\n(“Strunk”). Id. at 647. Johnson argued that the covenant was overbroad because 1) its restriction on his solicitation of certain\nASM's prospective clients and “affiliation members” was unrelated to any training or confidential information he received; 2)\nASM's protection of its goodwill was unrelated to any such information; and 3) there was no basis for restricting Johnson from\ncalling on ASM's clients of whom he was aware before signing the agreement. Id. at 657. The Court disagreed noting that with\nJohnson's help, as director of affiliation, ASM continued to develop clients for four years after the agreement was signed. Id.\nIn addition, Johnson helped develop ASM's goodwill and could have tried to unfairly capitalize on it after going to Strunk. Id.\n\n *8 The Court found significant that Johnson was privy to ASM's development of an overdraft protection product, while Strunk\nwas the market leader for such products. Id. at 647, 657. The Court noted that the record established that the covenant would\nhave prevented Johnson from calling on 821 ASM clients for one year. Id. at 657. Finally, the Court took into consideration the\nfact that Johnson had admitted in his agreement that his covenant with ASM was reasonable 3 and had testified that “[w]hen\n[he] began work with Strunk, he agreed he would not sell an overdraft protection product ... to anyone in the industry ... for\ntwo years after leaving Strunk's employment,” which Johnson further testified was reasonable. Id. The Court concluded the\ncovenant in Johnson's agreement with ASM was reasonable. Id.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                7\n\fPoole v. U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\nSheshunoff is distinguishable from the present case in that while ASM's restrictive covenant contained no geographic limitation,\nit only prevented Johnson from soliciting prior clients with whom he had personal contact or any “previously identified\nprospective client or affiliation member.” Id. at 647. Here, in addition to preventing Poole or Fendley from contacting existing\nand potential clients, the temporary injunction order prevents Poole and Fendley from engaging in any similar or related\nbusiness, in any capacity. Moreover, Johnson's job duties specifically involved client development and maintaining relationships\nwith prospective clients. Therefore, the restrictions in the covenant were directly related to Johnson's activities as an employee\nof the company. Like the defendant-employees in Haass and Wright, Poole and Fendley were salesmen. The law is well settled\nin Texas that “[i]n the case of covenants applied to a personal services occupation, such as that of a salesman, a restraint on\nclient solicitation is overbroad and unreasonable when it extends to clients with whom the employee had no dealings during his\n[or her] employment.” Stroman, 923 S.W.2d at 85 (citing Haass, 818 S.W.2d at 386–88; Daytona Group of Tex., Inc. v. Smith,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2383505\"><a href=\"/opinion/2383505/daytona-group-of-texas-inc-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1990, writ denied)). As the Court stated in Haass, there should be a connection\nbetween the personal involvement of the former employee and the client. Haass, 818 S.W.2d at 387. The Court's subsequent\ndecision in Sheshunoff did not change the law in this regard. 4\n\nU.S. Money Reserve argues that the court's order is reasonable based on the express provisions of the covenant wherein\nthe employees acknowledged “that the limitations as to time, geographic area, and scope of activity to be restrained are\nreasonable....” The Court in Sheshunoff analyzed the reasonableness of a covenant which included virtually identical language.\nSheshunoff, 209 S.W.3d at 656. Notably, while the Court considered the language in making its determination, the language\nalone was not outcome determinative. See id. at 657. Likewise, this court addressed an agreement in Wright which contained\na provision that remedies at law for any breach or attempted breach of the agreement would be inadequate and waived as a\ndefense that either party had an adequate remedy at law. Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 293–94. We noted that we were unaware of\nany Texas case holding that such agreements, alone, were controlling on those issues; however, we recognized Texas's strong\npublic policy in favor of preserving freedom of contract. Id. at 294. We considered the language of the agreement together with\nother evidence established by the record, including testimony that SSG's damages would have been difficult to calculate. Id. at\n293–94. Following this approach, we conclude that the language of the agreement at issue here is but one consideration in our\nanalysis to be viewed in conjunction with the record in its entirety. See Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 293–94; see also Sheshunoff,\n209 S.W.3d at 657. 5\n\n *9 In addition to relying on the contract's express language, U.S. Money Reserve argues that the restraints found in the\ntemporary injunction are reasonable because of the nature of its business. U .S. Money Reserve asserts that the key to its success\nin the coin business is its marketing. It further argues that because of its tremendous investment and experience in marketing\nin the coin industry, it has learned which techniques are effective, and its salesman are provided with confidential information\nabout the company's marketing techniques, which would give them an unfair advantage in the national coin market if they were\nallowed to work for a competitor. Leipsner testified that in addition to the company's customer list, the marketing materials the\ncompany puts together are protected confidential information. Leipsner explained that the company discusses the marketing\nmaterials with its salesmen before the materials are distributed to the public. This is done so that the company's salesmen will\nbe adequately prepared to answer sales calls from the public following the company's advertising or media campaigns.\n\nNonetheless, it is undisputed that Poole and Fendley worked in sales. While marketing and advertising materials may have\nbeen reviewed or discussed with Poole or Fendley prior to public distribution, neither Poole nor Fendley were shown during\nthe hearing to have been hired to head up or develop the company's marketing efforts. Poole testified that he had “no idea”\nhow the company determined what to include in its advertising. Poole testified that his job responsibilities as a salesman were\nlimited to making sales calls and acting as a team leader for his sales team. Likewise, Poole testified that his job responsibilities\ndid not include determining which cities the ads would run in. While Leipsner testified that his salespeople were privy to “the\nrationale and the way that we put things together” in terms of marketing and advertising, he admitted that crafting this type of\ninformation was not part of Poole's or Fendley's job responsibilities.\n\nViewing the record in its entirety and in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, we hold that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in entering a temporary injunction order that was overbroad. 6 Therefore, we overrule issue one and sustain issue two.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

U.S. Money Reserve, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2008)\n28 IER Cases 629\n\n\nCourts are generally required to reform overbroad convenants to the extent necessary to protect the business interest at issue. See\nTEX. BUS. & COM.CODE ANN. § 15.51(c); see also TEX.R.APP. P. 43.3. An exception to this rule exists where remand is\nnecessary for further proceedings. TEX.R.APP. P. 43.3(a); see also Wright, 137 S.W.3d at 299. Our determination of appellants'\nfinal issue requires that we dissolve the order granting the temporary injunction.\n\n\n\n                                                   IRREPARABLE INJURY\n\n [2] Appellants argue in issue three that the trial court abused its discretion in reaching the implied finding that U.S. Money\nReserve would suffer a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury. Specifically, appellants argue that there is an adequate legal\nremedy when damages for breach of contract are available thus, precluding injunctive relief. U.S. Money Reserve argues that\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in reaching the implied finding that U.S. Money Reserve would suffer a probable,\nimminent, and irreparable injury because 1) Poole testified that he does not believe that he or Fendley would have the money\nto pay a substantial judgment; 2) the damages suffered by U.S. Money Reserve are incapable of being measured by any certain\npecuniary standard—particularly, the damage to its relationship with its client-base; and 3) appellants contractually agreed that\nU.S. Money Reserve would suffer an irreparable injury if the restrictive covenants were breached and that damages would be\ndifficult, if not impossible, to calculate.\n\n *10 “An injury is irreparable if the injured party cannot be adequately compensated in damages or if the damages cannot be\nmeasured by any certain pecuniary standard.” Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204. Damages are inadequate, so as to support a temporary\ninjunction, if they are difficult to calculate. Rollins v.

Here, Poole stipulated that he sold coins to customers on U.S. Money Reserve's customer\nlist after leaving the company. He also admitted that U.S. Money Reserve could no longer “take [him] at [his] word” when he\nsays he will not contact their customers.\n\nIn support of their argument that the trial court abused its discretion, appellants point out that Leipsner testified that U.S. Money\nReserve suffered a twenty percent decline in revenues since appellants left the company, as well as a five percent increase in\ngold orders returned to the company since appellants left. Based on this testimony, appellants argue that damages are capable\nof ready calculation. However, Leipsner also testified that he did not believe that damages could be calculated exactly. While\nLeipsner admitted placing a $250,000 liquidated damage value on aspects of appellants' conduct, he testified additionally that\nthe long-term effects of appellants conduct also needed to be taken into account. Moreover, while Poole testified that he may\nbe able to take out a loan to satisfy a judgment in the nature of $20,000, he also testified that he did not think he would be\nable to satisfy a judgment in the neighborhood of $50,000 and certainly not a judgment for $250,000. Poole testified that in his\nopinion Fendley would also not be able to satisfy such a judgment. 7\n\nU.S. Money Reserve points to the contract language, arguing that appellants expressly agreed in the employment agreement that\nU.S. Money Reserve would suffer an irreparable injury if the restrictive covenants contained within the contracts are breached.\nFurther, appellants expressly acknowledge in the contract that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate damages as a\nresult of a breach of the restrictive covenants. Considering the language in the contract in conjunction with the testimony in the\nrecord, we cannot say the trial court erred in making the implied finding that U.S. Money Reserve, prior to trial, would suffer\na probable imminent and irreparable injury.

Id.\n\nHere, U.S. Money Reserve argues that appellants waived the right to raise this issue on appeal not only because they failed to\nraise it in the trial court, but also because appellants agreed to the court's judgment, wherein the phrase “Agreed as to Form\nOnly” prefaced appellants' counsel's signature.

In response, appellee argued that Garza “waived her complaint by agreeing to the terms of the temporary injunction.” Id.\nSpecifically, the temporary injunction stated that the parties agreed to the terms of the order as evidenced by their signatures,\nwhich were prefaced by the phrase “Approved as to Form Only.” Id.

Quest, 24 S.W.3d at 337\n(citing TEX.R. CIV. P. 683, 684). The Court disagreed stating,\n\n             These procedural requirements are mandatory, and an order granting a temporary injunction that does\n             not meet them is subject to being declared void and dissolved. In InterFirst Bank, however, the order\n             failed to set the case for trial on the merits. Yet rather than dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction,\n             we declared the temporary injunction void and ordered it dissolved. We have also held that a temporary\n             injunction was void when there was no bond. Here, these procedural requirements may render the trial\n             court's order void but they do not change the order's character and function defining its classification.\n\nId. (citations omitted). Based on this language, the court of appeals in Garza concluded that unless a temporary injunction\ncomplies with Rules 683 and 684, it is void. Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273; see also Int'l Brotherhood, 104 S.W.3d at 244. Based\non the Court's holding in Qwest, the court in Garza held that the temporary injunction, which failed to comply with Rules 683\nand 684, was void even though the parties expressly agreed to the temporary injunction order. Garza, 126 S.W.3d at 273.

Further, the order does not include a date setting the matter for trial as\nrequired by Rule 683. TEX.R. CIV. P. 683. Instead, the order attempts to enjoin the parties through a date certain in the future,\nJanuary 25, 2011. The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo through the date of trial. See Butnaru,\n84 S.W.3d at 204.\n\nWhile the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a temporary injunction to maintain the status quo, it did abuse its\ndiscretion in entering the temporary injunction order as crafted. We hold that the temporary injunction order is void as it is\noverly broad and fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 683. TEX.R. CIV. P. 683.

The language in Poole's and Fendley's agreements differed from the language in some\n        of the older employment agreements, which appear to have been inadvertently referenced by appellants in their brief. A significant\n        difference in the agreements at issue and the agreement referenced is that the term “clients” is defined in the agreements of Poole and\n        Fendley as set forth above. Likewise, the agreement set forth above is the agreement that Poole authenticated and testified to during\n        the hearing. While existing and potential customers and clients are defined in these employment agreements, the trial court's order\n        granting the temporary injunction made no attempt whatsoever to define “existing or potential clients or customers.”\n3       See Sheshunoff, 209 S.W.3d at 656.\n4       We note that Texas decisions analyzing the reasonableness of time, geography, and scope of activities restricted in covenants not\n        to compete are fact-specific and those decisions vary depending largely on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Counsel stated,\n            Now, the only area that this thing would possibly need to be reformed on is something we're willing to stipulate for the Court. It\n            does have a nationwide, industrywide exclusion and to start off we're willing to tell the Court that we are willing to reform that\n            to make it no competition if they are located in the state of Texas or any of the surrounding states with the state of Texas.\n            Therefore, if they want to sell coins in the state of Kentucky or the state of Georgia or Alaska or on the West Coast, we feel\n            that's fine....\n         Counsel additionally stated: “What I'm saying is that an industrywide, nationwide exclusion has been held unreasonable; .... [s]o,\n         what I'm suggesting is, ... the trial court merely has to make a decision on the trial court's own as to the scope of the geographic\n         restriction.” Appellant-employees, on the other hand, argued that the covenant needed to be reformed to prevent the employees from\n         soliciting clients with whom they had contact while working for U.S. Money Reserve or who were clients of the company. In fact,\n         there is evidence in the record that Poole agreed to enter into an injunction prohibiting him from contacting U .S. Money Reserve\n         clients. The trial court refrained from reforming the covenant prior to hearing testimony and allowed the parties to move forward.\n7     While there is evidence in the record that Fendley was subpoenaed, he failed to appear at the injunction hearing.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                          © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court of appeals held that the order was not an appealable\ntemporary injunction and dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1678538\"><a href=\"/opinion/1678538/qwest-communications-intern-inc-v-att-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Because we hold that the trial court's\norder grants a temporary injunction, we grant the petition and remand the case to the court of appeals to consider the merits\nof the appeal.\n\nIn 1997, AT & T Corporation and AT & T Communications of the Southwest, Inc. (collectively “AT & T”) sued Qwest\nCommunications Corporation, Qwest Communications International, Inc. (collectively “Qwest”), and others for damages to\nAT & T's fiber optic cables. In addition, AT & T sought a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, and a permanent\ninjunction. On the same day that the petition was filed, the trial court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order.\n\nAt the temporary injunction hearing, the parties informed the trial court that they had resolved the matters set for the temporary\ninjunction hearing, and then read the agreement into the record. Among other restrictions applicable to all activities within the\nUnited States, the agreement required Qwest to notify AT & T of any construction operations within thirty feet of an AT & T\nunderground facility, and to electronically monitor the location of the drill borehead used during boring and pullback operations.\nFurther, the agreement dissolved the previous temporary restraining order bond, left open any claims for damages, and expired\nthree years from the date it became effective unless extended or modified in a signed writing by the parties. At the conclusion of\nthis hearing, the judge stated that “[w]ith respect to the plaintiff's application for temporary injunction, judgment is rendered”\nand told counsel for AT & T to prepare a written order, deliver it to Qwest's counsel for comment, and then submit it to the trial\ncourt. Ultimately, the parties could not agree to the terms of the written order to be submitted to the trial court. The trial court,\nafter a “clarification” hearing, signed an order following the terms recited into the record at the temporary injunction hearing.\n\nQwest appealed. But the court of appeals dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction, holding that the order did not grant a\ntemporary injunction. The court concluded that the order did not meet the “traditional requirements” of a temporary injunction\nbecause the order did not preserve the status quo, require a bond, set a trial date, require the clerk to issue a writ of injunction,\nnor was the order's duration limited until final judgment or further order of the court. 983 S.W.2d at 888. Qwest then petitioned\nthis Court for review.\n\n [1]    [2] This Court has jurisdiction to determine whether a court of appeals correctly decided its jurisdiction over an\ninterlocutory *336 appeal.

Finally, AT & T notes that the order did not set a bond or trial date and did not order\nissuance of a writ of injunction.\n\nThe order's features that AT & T identifies do not necessarily control the classification of this order as a temporary injunction. In\nDel Valle Independent School District v. Lopez, we rejected the notion that “matters of form control the nature of the order itself\n—it is the character and function of an order that determine its classification.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429810\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429810/del-valle-indep-school-dist-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (Tex.1992). We reasoned\nthat if errors in the form of the order determined the order's status, then those errors would deny review of the very defects that\nrender the order void.

The order recites that it is effective for a set\nthree-year period from the date it was rendered unless it is extended or modified in writing signed by the parties. AT & T notes\nthat this Court has previously stated that a temporary injunction “operates until dissolved by an interlocutory order or until the\nfinal hearing.” Brines, 596 S.W.2d at 523; see also J.C.

Thus, we must decide\nwhether the fixed three-year term precludes the order's classification as a temporary injunction.\n\nSome courts of appeals' opinions have held an order was a temporary injunction even when it granted the maximum duration of\nrelief to which the plaintiff would be entitled at a trial on the merits. See Glenn Advertising, Inc. v. Black, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1720352\"><a href=\"/opinion/1720352/glenn-advertising-inc-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 844\n(Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14 th Dist.] 1970, writ ref'd n.r.e.). In Glenn Advertising, the court of appeals noted that the order\nshould correctly provide that the temporary injunction should remain in effect only until final hearing or until further order of\nthe court. Id. Yet, the court did not dismiss the appeal for *337 want of jurisdiction, but instead simply modified the order\nto remain in full force and effect until final judgment was entered. Other courts of appeals have followed this reasoning and\nexercised jurisdiction over appeals from orders that were not made effective until final judgment or further action by the trial\ncourt.

See Aloe Vera of America, Inc. v. CIC Cosmetics Int'l Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1792220\"><a href=\"/opinion/1792220/aloe-vera-of-america-inc-v-cic-cosmetics-int-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nDallas 1974, no writ). In Aloe Vera, the trial court signed an order styled “Permanent Injunction” and directed the clerk to issue\na “Writ of Injunction permanently enjoining until January 1, 1975.” The court of appeals held that limiting the restraint to the\nperiod ending January 1, 1975, precluded the order from being a temporary injunction. “Whether the restraint continues for six\nmonths or six years has no bearing on the question of permanency. No more permanent order could be made with respect to\nthis particular claim for injunctive relief.” Id. at 436. The court therefore held that the order was an interlocutory permanent\ninjunction rather than a temporary injunction and thus was not appealable. See id. Other courts of appeals have adopted the\nreasoning of Aloe Vera. See James v.

See Del Valle, 845 S.W.2d at 809–10. Whether an injunction is effective for a fixed period of time or is made\neffective only until further order of the court or final judgment is only one of the factors in determining the character and nature\nof the order. Because the trial court's order places restrictions on Qwest and is made effective immediately so that it operates\nduring the pendency of the suit, it functions as a temporary injunction.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure require that an order granting a temporary injunction set the cause for\ntrial on the merits and fix the amount of security to be given by the applicant. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 683, 684. These procedural\nrequirements are mandatory, and an order granting a temporary injunction that does not meet them is subject to being declared\nvoid and dissolved. See InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523599\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523599/interfirst-bank-san-felipe-v-paz-const-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 641 (Tex.1986) (stating that\nrequirements of Rule 683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed). In InterFirst Bank, however, the order failed to set the\ncase for trial on the merits. Id. at 641. Yet rather than dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction, we declared the temporary\ninjunction void and ordered it dissolved. See id. We have also held that a temporary injunction was void when there was no\nbond. See Lancaster v.

Here, these procedural requirements may render the trial court's order void but they do not change the order's\ncharacter and function defining its classification.\n\n *338 We hold that, in character and function, the trial court's order grants a temporary injunction and is appealable under\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 51.014(a)(4). We do not express any opinion, however, on the merits of the\nappeal. Accordingly, the Court grants petitioner's petition for review and, without hearing oral argument, reverses the judgment\nof the court of appeals and remands the case to that court for consideration of the merits of the appeal.

Because the court of\nappeals concluded otherwise, we reverse its judgment and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n\nI. Background\nFormer Chief Deputy Constable Larry Roccaforte sued Jefferson County and Constable Jeff Greenway, alleging that his\nwrongful termination deprived him of rights guaranteed by the Texas Constitution. Roccaforte personally served County Judge\nCarl Griffith with the suit, and fifteen days later, the County (represented by the district attorney) and Constable Greenway\nanswered, denying liability. The County propounded written discovery requests, deposed Roccaforte, and presented County\nofficials for depositions. The County also filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that Roccaforte did not give requisite notice\nof the suit. See TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODEE § 89.0041. Roccaforte disagreed, arguing that the statute applied only to contract\nclaims. Alternatively, he argued that 42 U.S.C. § 1983 preempted the notice requirements and that he substantially complied\nwith them in any event.\n\nAlthough the trial court indicated that it would sustain the County's plea and sever those claims from the underlying case, it\ndid not immediately sign an order doing so. In the meantime, Roccaforte tried his claims against Greenway. A jury returned a\nverdict in Roccaforte's favor. Afterwards, the trial court signed an order granting the County's jurisdictional plea. The order did\nnot sever the claims from the underlying case. Roccaforte then pursued this interlocutory appeal. His notice of appeal stated\nthat “[p]ursuant to Civ. P. Rem.Code § 51.014(b), all proceedings are *921 stayed in the trial court pending resolution of the\nappeal.” But the proceedings were not stayed.\n\nIn the underlying case, Greenway moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court granted as to\nRoccaforte's property interest and First Amendment retaliation claims but denied as to Roccaforte's claimed violation of his\nliberty interest. Roccaforte moved for entry of judgment. Notwithstanding the statutory stay referenced in Roccaforte's notice\nof appeal, the trial court rendered judgment for Roccaforte and awarded damages, attorney's fees, and costs. The judgment\nwas titled “FINAL JUDGMENT”; it “denie[d] all relief no [sic] granted in this judgment”; and it stated “[t]his is a FINAL\nJUDGMENT.” The County was included in the case caption. No one objected to the continuation of trial court proceedings\ndespite the statutory stay.\n\nGreenway appealed, and Roccaforte cross-appealed, raising as his only issues complaints regarding the trial court's JNOV on\nhis claims against Greenway. The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, rendering judgment that Roccaforte\ntake nothing. Greenway v.

The trial court did not sever Roccaforte's claims against the County 3 and denied “all relief not granted” in its final\njudgment. Ordinarily, under these circumstances, Roccaforte would have to complain on appeal that the trial court erroneously\ndismissed those claims. Roccaforte, however, did not complain about the County's dismissal in his appeal from the final\njudgment. His separate interlocutory appeal, then, rests on a precipice of mootness.\n\n\n*922 A. Roccaforte waived any complaint about the trial court's actions during the statutory stay.\nAlthough Roccaforte's interlocutory appeal was supposed to stay all proceedings in the trial court pending resolution of the\nappeal, 4 Roccaforte did not object to the trial court's rendition of judgment while the stay was in effect. To the contrary, he\naffirmatively moved for entry of judgment. Because a final judgment frequently moots an interlocutory appeal, 5 we must\ndecide whether the trial court's failure to observe the stay made the final judgment void or merely voidable. If the final judgment\nis void, it would have no impact on this interlocutory appeal. Lindsay v.

That is the case here. The trial court's rendition of final judgment while the stay was in\neffect was voidable, not void, and Roccaforte's failure to object to the trial court's actions waived any error related to the stay.\nWe must, therefore, confront the fact that the trial *924 court signed a final judgment disposing of all parties and all claims\nand that Roccaforte did not present in his appeal from that judgment the arguments he advances in this interlocutory appeal.\n\n\nB. The trial court's final judgment implicitly modified its interlocutory order, and we treat this appeal as relating to\nthat final judgment.\n [2] We have repeatedly held that the right of appeal should not be lost due to procedural technicalities. 8 Roccaforte timely\nperfected appeals from both the interlocutory order and the final judgment, and this is not a situation in which further proceedings\nmooted the issues raised in Roccaforte's interlocutory appeal. 9\n\n[3]   Our procedural rules provide that:\n\n            After an order or judgment in a civil case has been appealed, if the trial court modifies the order or\n            judgment, or if the trial court vacates the order or judgment and replaces it with another appealable\n            order or judgment, the appellate court must treat the appeal as from the subsequent order or judgment\n            and may treat actions relating to the appeal of the first order or judgment as relating to the appeal of\n            the subsequent order or judgment. The subsequent order or judgment and actions relating to it may be\n            included in the original or supplemental record. Any party may nonetheless appeal from the subsequent\n            order or judgment.\n\nTEX.R.APP. P. 27.3. Here, although the trial court's final judgment did not expressly modify its interlocutory order, it did\nso implicitly. Because the claims against the County had not been severed, the County remained a party to the underlying\nproceeding despite the interlocutory appeal. The final judgment necessarily replaced the interlocutory order, which merged into\nthe judgment, 10 even though Roccaforte's interlocutory appeal remained pending. Under our rules, however, we may treat this\ninterlocutory appeal as an *925 appeal from the final judgment. That permits us to reach the merits of Roccaforte's claims\nrather than dismiss the interlocutory appeal as moot.\n\nAlthough not relying on rule 27.3, the court of appeals took a similar approach, treating Roccaforte's appeal as though it were\nfrom the final judgment. 281 S.W.3d at 231 n. 1. Similarly, we treat Roccaforte's appellate complaints about the trial court's\ngrant of the County's jurisdictional plea as though they related to the appeal of the final judgment.

Where the appropriate county officials receive timely notice of the suit, the case should not be dismissed if notice\nwas provided by some means other than mail.\nRoccaforte provided timely notice of every item required by section 89.0041, and the requisite officials received that notice.\nDid the Legislature intend to bar Roccaforte's claim, merely because that notice was hand-delivered rather than mailed?\n\nRoccaforte argues that the County's actual notice of the suit and his substantial compliance with section 89.0041 should suffice.\nA number of courts of appeals (though not the court of appeals in this case) agree with him. 11 The County disagrees, arguing\nthat the statute requires strict compliance with its terms, and dismissal is mandated if those terms are not satisfied.\n\n [5] Section 89.0041 ensures that the appropriate county officials are made aware of pending suits, allowing the county to\nanswer and defend the case. See Howlett, 301 S.W.3d at 846 (“The apparent purpose of section 89.0041 is to ensure that the\nperson responsible for answering and defending the suit—the county or district attorney-has actual notice of the suit itself.”);\nCoskey, 247 S.W.3d at 757 (“Section 89.0041's notice of suit requirement against a county serves the purpose of aiding in\nthe management and control of the City's finances and property....”). That purpose was served here—the county judge and the\ndistrict attorney had notice within fifteen days of Roccaforte's filing, and they answered and defended the suit. Cf. Loutzenhiser,\n140 S.W.3d at 360 (observing that “if in a particular case a governmental unit were not prejudiced by lack of notice and chose\nto waive it, we do not see how the statutory purpose would thereby be impaired”). The statute was not intended to create a\nprocedural trap allowing a county to obtain dismissal even though the appropriate officials have notice of the suit. See *927\nSouthern Surety Co. v. McGuire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3927241\"><a href=\"/opinion/4161268/southern-surety-co-v-mcguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847 (Tex.Civ.App.-El Paso 1925, writ ref'd) (holding that failure to present\nwritten claim to commissioners' court as required by statute did not bar the claim, because “[t]he purpose of the statute was\nfully accomplished by [oral presentment]”); see also Coskey, 247 S.W.3d at 757 (“The manner of delivery specified by the\nstatute assures that county officials will receive notice of a suit after it has been filed to enable it to respond timely and prepare\na defense.”). Because those officers had the requisite notice, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing Roccaforte's\nclaims.\n\n\nV. Conclusion\nRoccaforte's claims against the County should not have been dismissed for lack of notice. 12 We reverse the court of appeals'\njudgment as to those claims and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings. TEX.R.APP. P. 60.2(d).\n\n\n\nJustice WILLETT delivered a concurring opinion.\n\nJustice WILLETT, concurring in part.\nI join Parts I–III of the Court's opinion. As for Part IV, I join the result but not the reasoning. There is a better approach, one\nmore allegiant to the Legislature's words. Roccaforte's claim should proceed, but the reason is rooted not in his substantial\ncompliance but rather the County's substantial dalliance.\n\n***\n\nAristotle would have enjoyed this case, which perfectly illustrates the challenge he recognized of reconciling the “absoluteness”\nof the written law with equity in the particular case. 1 Believing that “the equitable is superior” and that rigid laws must bend, 2\nAristotle urged “a correction of law where it is defective owing to its universality.” 3 From Athens, Greece to Athens, Texas\n(and beyond), judges still debate the bounds of interpretive discretion—whether it is appropriate to temper the “absoluteness”\nof statutory mandates and ameliorate their seeming harshness. Millennia may have passed since Aristotle's Lyceum, but this\ngreat philosophical and jurisprudential debate endures.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

So, to escape\nthe statute's emphatic “shall dismiss the suit” mandate, 8 the Court pivots on “actual notice” and “substantial compliance” and\nholds that the statute's purpose was fulfilled via hand-delivery.\n\nHonoring a statute's plain words is indispensable, even if enforcing those words as written works an unpalatable result. To be\nsure, courts deviate from otherwise-clear textual commands to avert “absurd” results or to vindicate constitutional principles. 9\nBut as a general matter, if the legal deck is stacked via technical statutory requirements, the Legislature should reshuffle the\nequities, not us. 10\n\n\nAs for whether Section 89.0041's use of phrases like “shall deliver,” 11 “must be delivered,” 12 “as required,” 13 and “shall\ndismiss” 14 mandates strict compliance, I would take the statute at face value. Beyond that, those desiring additional reassurance\nthat lawmakers intended what they enacted can find it in a properly contextual reading of other notice-related statutes.\n\nFirst, the Legislature, while omitting an actual-notice exception from Section 89.0041, expressly included one in the Tort Claims\nAct, stating the Act's pre-suit notice requirements “do not apply if the governmental unit has actual notice....” 15 The Legislature\nunderstands how to let actual notice excuse technical noncompliance; it easily could have said actual notice suffices, thus\nobviating the need for service via certified or registered mail. Instead, it opted against actual notice, presumably on purpose.\nFor better or worse, lawmakers enacted strict compliance, not substantial compliance. Our interpretive focus, both textual and\ncontextual, must be on the law as written, and we should refuse to engraft what the Legislature has refused to enact.\n\nSecond, reading “actual notice” into Section 89.0041's post-suit notice requirement robs it of any real meaning and also makes\nSection 89.004's pre-suit notice requirement redundant. Section 89.004 forbids someone from suing a county or county official\n“unless the person has presented the claim to the commissioners court and the commissioners court neglects or refuses to pay\nall or part of the claim....” 16 This presentment requirement assures actual notice of a claim before it is filed and was already\non the books when Section 89.0041 was added in 2003. Logically then, Section 89.0041 must require something in addition\nto the preexisting notice and presentment requirements. 17\n\n\n*929 The requisite officials here received notice, but they did not receive “requisite notice,” as the Court states. 18 The Court\nmay deem it adequate, but it is irrefutably not requisite. As the Court reads Section 89.0041, it is not only nonjurisdictional (I\nagree on this point), but also nonmandatory. I acknowledge the statute's no-exceptions mandate works a harsh result, 19 but to\nthe degree this seems a trap for the unwary, it is a trap the Legislature left well marked.\n\n\n\n                                                                II\n\nHaving said all that, I agree with the Court that Roccaforte ultimately wins his notice dispute, but on different grounds. Instead\nof asking whether the Legislature meant to bar Roccaforte's claim,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

I believe so. 20\n\n *930 True, the County, after waiting for limitations to expire, filed a motion for dismissal complaining that Roccaforte\nprovided notice via personal service rather than registered or certified mail. I believe that obscures the key point, which on\nthese facts is not whether the County sought dismissal, but when. A governmental body can raise a jurisdictional bar like\nimmunity from suit whenever it pleases because “the trial court does not have—and never had—power to decide the case,” 21\nthus making judgments forever vulnerable to delayed attack. Not so with nonjurisdictional requirements like this, which are\nwaived if not timely raised. Under our precedent, dismissal delayed is sometimes dismissal denied: “The failure of a non-\njurisdictional requirement mandated by statute may result in the loss of a claim, but that failure must be timely asserted and\ncompliance can be waived.” 22 Moreover, “if a governmental unit is to avoid litigation to which it should not be subjected\nbecause of lack of notice, it should raise the issue as soon as possible.” 23 On these facts, there was no timely assertion, much\nless one made “as soon as possible.” 24\n\n\nWe have held that waiver is decided on a case-by-case basis, meaning courts look to the totality of the circumstances. 25 Here,\n *931 the County sought dismissal based on imperfect notice more than two years after suit was filed; more than two years\nafter the County filed its answer; more than two years after the County filed its special exceptions; after the County presented\nthree County officials for deposition and defended those depositions; after the County sent written discovery requests; after\nthe County deposed Roccaforte; and after the County filed a motion for continuance. If two-plus years qualifies as “timely\nasserted” or “as soon as possible”—at least in the context of a statutory notice requirement commanding action—then these\nphrases have been drained of all meaning. 26 Indeed, the only thing the County “timely asserted” was limitations. I would\ndisallow the County's belated insistence on dismissal given its decision to defend the case for so long, asserting noncompliance\nonly after seizing tactical advantage via limitations, and thus materially prejudicing Roccaforte. There is no countervailing\nprejudice in allowing Roccaforte's suit to proceed against the County, which can hardly argue at this late stage that imperfect\nnotice has harmed its legal position (unlike its fiscal position, having underwritten years of legal and judicial expenses). On\nthese facts, two-plus years of litigation activity to run out the limitations clock betrays the County's too-little, too-late request\nfor dismissal and constitutes waiver.\n\nThe Court's understandable desire to work an eminently fair result has led it to revise the statute as desired rather than read it as\nenacted. I favor a different approach to the same outcome. Roccaforte should win not because the Court waived the Legislature's\nwords but because the County did.\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n32 IER Cases 346, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

The issue in Cox involved how much particularity was required in notice. 706 S.W.2d at 960 (noting that “less than\n          full disclosure is not substantial compliance” and that “the Open Meetings Act requires a full disclosure of the subject matter of\n          the meetings”). Artco–Bell is likewise inapposite. In Artco–Bell, the Court simply invalidated the notice requirement in a city's\n          charter and held the plaintiff had provided sufficient notice. 616 S.W.2d at 193–94 (“[W]e hold that the requirement of verification\n          represents an unreasonable limitation on the City's liability and is invalid as it is contrary to the limitation of authority placed upon\n          home rule cities....”) (footnote omitted).\n          Cox was about the specificity of notice; Artco–Bell resulted in the invalidation of notice. In neither case did the Court craft an\n          exception for notice. The lower courts' treatment of these cases was thus strained, and should not be taken as a correct reading of\n          our jurisprudence on statutory notice requirements.\n18     341 S.W.3d at 927.\n19     Had the County “timely asserted” Roccaforte's noncompliance, dismissal would have been mandatory under the statute's rigid, no-\n       discretion mandate, thus raising the question of whether Section 89.0041's notice regime is preempted by 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

The Court held that delay does not always\n           result in waiver, but it does when the defendant's silence or inaction for such a long period shows an intent to yield a known\n           right. Id. at 157. I would hold that the County's actions are inconsistent with the intent to assert its statutory right to up-front\n           dismissal based on defective notice. Moreover, Jernigan predates our 2004 decision in Loutzenhiser, which speaks specifically\n           to statutorily mandated notice requirements involving governmental units and says notice-based objections should be asserted “as\n           soon as possible.” 140 S.W.3d at 360.\n26     It is true that defendants may assert defenses like limitations in the trial court even following extensive discovery and other pre-trial\n       activity. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 94 (affirmative defenses including limitations must be pleaded); TEX.R. CIV. P. 63 (pleadings may\n       be amended without leave of court until seven days before trial). Today's case, though, involves a statutory notice requirement that\n       mandates action within a prescribed time, something Loutzenhiser held should be raised “as soon as possible” since the statutory\n       purpose is to avoid litigation altogether. 140 S.W.3d at 360.\n           Section 89.0041 may not be a prerequisite to bringing suit, but it is a postrequisite to maintaining suit. In my view, Section 89.0041,\n           unlike the Tort Claims Act, does not allow actual notice to forgive defective notice, but that does not mean actual notice may not\n           affect the waiver inquiry of whether a defendant “timely asserted” noncompliance. For reasons stated above, I believe a county that\n           quickly asserts statutory noncompliance, even if it has actual notice, is entitled to dismissal under Section 89.0041. But a county\n           with actual notice that untimely asserts noncompliance (here only after limitations had run two-plus years later) has waived its\n           objection and is not entitled to dismissal.

Here, the County would\n           be rewarded for wasting over two-years' worth of judicial resources and taxpayer dollars in defending a suit it could have easily\n           dismissed from the outset.\n       ***\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

FACTS\n\nIn the 1970s, John Swanson and his brother George Swanson approached SEDCO, Inc. about a proposal to mine diamonds\nfrom the ocean floor in deep waters off the South African coast. SEDCO had expertise in offshore oil and gas drilling and had\nmined manganese nodules off the ocean floor. The Swansons, whose family had been in the mining industry in South Africa for\nseveral decades, had contacts with the South African government. By letter dated October 17, 1978, SEDCO agreed to a three-\nphase project. In Phase I, SEDCO would study the feasibility of the sea-diamond project. In Phase II, a lease was to be acquired\nand prospecting was to begin. Phase III was to be commercial mining. The agreement provided that SEDCO had exclusive\nauthority to determine whether to proceed with Phases II and III.\n\nThe Swansons were to use their goodwill and contacts to obtain concession rights and any licenses or permits the South African\ngovernment required. They also were to provide SEDCO with information on diamond mining generally and offshore mining\nspecifically. For their part, the Swansons would be paid a consulting fee through Phases I and II and a royalty, if any, on any\ndiamonds mined during Phases II and III. Should the project ever become commercially productive, the Swansons had the right\nto purchase five percent of the shares in the company contemplated to be formed to mine the diamonds. SEDCO was to bear the\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                          4\n\fSchlumberger Technology Corp. v.

Any diamond grants or\noffshore concessions or leases were to be held by SEDCO, by the company to be formed, or by the Swansons, but as trustees.\n\nSEDCO completed Phase I in 1979 and opted to proceed with Phase II. In July 1983, SEDCO and George E. Swanson\nEnterprises, as co-lessees, obtained a prospecting lease, Lease 3C, from the South African government. At the same time,\nthe South African government issued leases on surrounding tracts to other companies. DeBeers Mining Consolidated Limited\n(DeBeers) obtained Leases 4C and 5C immediately to the south; African Selection Trust Exploration (Pty.) Limited (Seltrust),\na subsidiary of British Petroleum, obtained Lease 2C to the north.\n\nAlmost immediately after receiving the leases, SEDCO, DeBeers, and Seltrust began negotiating a joint venture agreement\nto jointly develop the mining project. In December 1984, before this joint venture agreement was finalized, Schlumberger\nTechnology Corporation acquired SEDCO by merger and formed Sedswan Diamonds (Pty.), Limited, a wholly-owned South\nAfrican subsidiary, to continue the sea-diamond project. Sedswan then entered into the joint venture with DeBeers and Seltrust\nin February 1985. Around the same time, the South African government reissued Lease 3C in Sedswan's name only and without\nreference to George E. Swanson Enterprises. Sedswan, DeBeers, and Seltrust participated in the joint venture through 1986.\nIn early January *174 1987, the Swansons became concerned about rumors that Schlumberger was going to stop funding\nits share or withdraw from the joint venture. Further, they were disturbed about the lack of information they were receiving\non the project's progress. Consequently, the Swansons consulted a lawyer. Their objectives were to ensure that Schlumberger\nstayed in the joint venture and that their rights under the original letter agreement, which predated the joint venture agreement,\nwere enforced. Of particular concern to the Swansons was the effect of the joint venture agreement on the Swansons' interests,\nincluding Schlumberger's ability to dilute Sedswan's joint venture interest after an initial investment, the right of first refusal\ngiven to the other joint venture members, and a confidentiality agreement.\n\nShortly after the Swansons hired their lawyer, Schlumberger gave notice to DeBeers and Seltrust of its intent to withdraw\nSedswan from the joint venture. As required by the joint venture agreement, Schlumberger offered to sell Sedswan's interest\nto the remaining joint venture members. DeBeers and Seltrust rejected this offer, each refusing to buy out Sedswan's interest\nso long as it was subject to any rights the Swansons may claim.\n\nDuring the next thirteen months, Schlumberger negotiated its withdrawal from and a price for Sedswan's joint venture interest\nwith DeBeers and Seltrust. Schlumberger initially offered to sell Sedswan's interest for twenty-five million dollars plus a royalty.\nDeBeers and Seltrust rejected this offer and countered at ten million rand. Schlumberger dropped its demand for a royalty and\noffered to sell for thirty-five million dollars. Again, DeBeers and Seltrust rejected this offer, holding firm at ten million rand.\n\nThroughout this time, Schlumberger discussed the various proposals with the Swansons, communicating mostly through their\nlawyer. According to the Swansons, Schlumberger represented to them that the sea-diamond project was neither technologically\nfeasible nor commercially viable, but refused to give them joint venture progress reports and other information and data\nsupporting Schlumberger's views. During these negotiations, Schlumberger also disputed the validity of the Swansons' rights\nand interests in the joint venture, claiming that the joint venture agreement altered whatever rights the Swansons had.\nDispleased with Schlumberger's decision to withdraw Sedswan from the joint venture and concerned about Schlumberger's\nassertions disputing their interests and its unwillingness to turn over joint venture information, the Swansons contemplated\nsuing Schlumberger but did not.\n\nInstead, in February 1988, a little more than a year after Schlumberger gave notice of its withdrawal from the joint venture, the\nSwansons agreed that Schlumberger would buy their interest for two million South African rand (about $814,000). In exchange,\nthe Swansons relinquished all rights, claims, and interests in the offshore diamond project and Lease 3C and released all causes\nof action against Schlumberger, known or unknown. In the release, the Swansons specifically agreed that they were not relying\non any statement or representation of Schlumberger, SEDCO, or Sedswan, that they were relying on their own judgment, and\nthat they had been represented by counsel who had explained the entire contents and legal consequences of the release.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We agree that the release precludes\nall of the Swansons' claims as a matter of law. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and render judgment for\nSchlumberger. Because of our disposition, we need not reach the prejudgment interest issue.\n\n\n\n                                           II. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES\n\nSchlumberger argues that the Swansons' fraud claims are barred as a matter of law because the Swansons were represented\nby legal counsel throughout the arm's-length negotiations between the parties. Schlumberger contends that when a party is\nrepresented by counsel and that party agrees that, in signing a release, it is not relying on any statement or representation of the\nparty to be released, the presence of independent legal advice breaks the chain of both reliance and causation. Schlumberger\nreasons that if parties can refute their reliance, even though they were represented by counsel when they settled their claims,\nlitigation never ends. This is so, Schlumberger says, because dissatisfied parties could always break their settlement by claiming\nthat the other party, through its misrepresentations, fraudulently induced them to enter into the settlement or release.\n\nImportant to Schlumberger's position is its assertion that it was negotiating with the Swansons at arm's length. Schlumberger\ncontends that it openly disputed the validity of the Swansons' interests in the sea-diamond project. Schlumberger further\ncontends that,by virtue of the extended adversarial negotiations through legal counsel over the Swansons' rights and the buyout\nof their interests, if any, Schlumberger did not owe a fiduciary duty to the Swansons during the negotiations.\n\nThe Swansons respond, however, that there was a long-standing fiduciary relationship that arose either because Schlumberger\nand the Swansons were partners or because they were parties to a confidential relationship. Given that relationship, the Swansons\nargue, Schlumberger cannot unilaterally eliminate the fiduciary duty by generating a dispute with the Swansons.\n\nAs the relationship between the parties informs both parties' arguments on the effect of the disclaimer of reliance, we must first\ndetermine the nature of that relationship.\n\n\n\n                                                       A.

We\nconcluded that more mischief would result from relieving the fiduciary of his duty to make full disclosure than from requiring\nadherence to his fiduciary responsibilities. Id. If Schlumberger and the Swansons were partners, Johnson counsels that their\nnegotiations terminating their relationship would not be at arm's length, but would be conducted under the higher fiduciary\nstandard requiring full disclosure.\n\nSchlumberger does not challenge Johnson on principle, but contends that there is no evidence of a partnership between it and\nthe Swansons. We agree.\n\n *176 At the outset, we note that the Legislature revised the Texas Uniform Partnership Act in 1993, effective January 1994. Act\nof May 31, 1993, 73d Leg. R.S., ch. 917, § 1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3887. As the Swansons and SEDCO originally formed their\nenterprise in 1978, the pre–1993 statute and case law decided under that statute control our determination. See TEX.REV.CIV.\nSTAT. ANN.. art. 6132b, § 47.\n\n [1] Under the Texas Uniform Partnership Act, a partnership or joint venture is an association of two or more persons to carry\non as co-owners a business for profit. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. ANN.. art. 6132b, § 6. As the issue was submitted to the jury, a\npartnership consists of an express or implied agreement containing four required elements: (1) a community of interest in the\nventure, (2) an agreement to share profits, (3) an agreement to share losses, and (4) a mutual right of control or management\nof the enterprise. See Coastal Plains Dev. Corp. v. Micrea, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774184\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774184/coastal-plains-development-corp-v-micrea-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287 (Tex.1978). Accordingly, if there is no\nevidence of any one element of a partnership, we cannot sustain the jury's affirmative finding.\n\n [2] We conclude that there is no evidence of an agreement to share profits. The undisputed evidence is that the Swansons were\nto receive a royalty on diamonds mined in Phases II and III and that their royalty was to be paid before expenses. Entitlement\nto a royalty based on gross receipts is not profit sharing. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. ANN.. art. 6132b, § 7(3) (sharing gross\nreturns does not itself establish partnership); see also Patton v. Callaway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2450939\"><a href=\"/opinion/2450939/patton-v-callaway/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1975,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.). Of course, the payment of consultation fees is not the sharing of profits. Such payments are compensation for\nservices rendered and are unrelated to the venture's profits. See Grimmett v. Higginbotham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742647\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742647/grimmett-v-higginbotham/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2–4 (Tex.App.—\nTyler 1994, writ denied) (weekly compensation unrelated to financial requirements of business is no evidence of agreement\nto share profits or losses); Gutierrez v.

But this is evidence only that the Swansons may have had an interest\nin the sea-diamond project. It is circular to contend that the payment in settlement of the Swansons' disputed interests proves\nthose interests. The two million rand Schlumberger paid the Swansons to settle and release their claimed interests in the sea-\ndiamond project is no evidence of an agreement to share partnership profits.\n\n [4] Because there is no evidence of an agreement to share profits, there is no evidence of a partnership under the question\nsubmitted to the jury. This conclusion renders unnecessary any consideration of Schlumberger's other evidentiary contentions\non the remaining elements of a partnership. We conclude that the Swansons and Schlumberger were not partners.\n\n\n\n                                          B. CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP\n\nThe Swansons claim that even if the technical requirements of a partnership are not satisfied, they were nonetheless owed a\nfiduciary duty by Schlumberger arising out of a confidential relationship.

See Thigpen v. Locke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746605\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746605/thigpen-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253 (Tex.1962); Fitz–\nGerald v.

But not every relationship involving a high *177 degree of trust and\nconfidence rises to the stature of a fiduciary relationship. See Crim Truck & Tractor Co. v. Navistar Int'l Transp.

In order to give full force to contracts, we do not create such a relationship lightly. See Thigpen,\n363 S.W.2d at 253. Accordingly, while a fiduciary or confidential relationship may arise from the circumstances of a particular\ncase, to impose such a relationship in a business transaction, the relationship must exist prior to, and apart from, the agreement\nmade the basis of the suit.

In this case, there is no evidence\nthat a prior fiduciary relationship had arisen between the Swansons and Schlumberger.\n\n [7] [8] We recognize that the Swansons testified that they trusted and relied on Schlumberger to negotiate a fair price\nwith DeBeers and Seltrust for Sedswan's interest in the joint venture. However, mere subjective trust does not, as a matter of\nlaw, transform arm's-length dealing into a fiduciary relationship. See Crim Truck, 823 S.W.2d at 595. In addition, though, the\nSwansons point out that certain Schlumberger and SEDCO executives testified that the Swansons were their “partners” in the\nsea-diamond project, and that the original lease application to the South African government and the original lease from the\nSouth African government provided that SEDCO and the Swansons were partners. The Swansons maintain that this evidence\nestablished, at the very minimum, that both parties believed a confidential relationship existed, providing some evidence to\nsupport the jury's finding. Again, the fact that the parties to a transaction trust one another will not, in and of itself, establish\na finding of a confidential relationship. See Thigpen, 363 S.W.2d at 253.

As we have said, there is no evidence of a prior fiduciary relationship in this case.\n\n [9] The Swansons next rely on evidence that Schlumberger thought it had an obligation to get the best deal it could for itself\nand the Swansons, to “put the Swansons' interest at least equal” to its own, and that it was representing the Swansons' interest in\nnegotiating with DeBeers and Seltrust. This evidence proves only that Schlumberger's interests were aligned with the Swansons'\nto obtain the best possible price for Sedswan's joint venture interest and, to that end, Schlumberger spoke not only for itself,\nbut also for the Swansons. To permit any further inference would impose a fiduciary relationship in every contract because all\ncontracting parties presumably contract for their mutual benefit. Once again, the fact that Schlumberger and the Swansons were\naligned does not create a confidential relationship giving rise to a fiduciary duty in the absence of a prior relationship.\n\nFinally, the Swansons argue that Manges v.

Manges simply is inapposite.\n\nWe conclude that there is no evidence of a partnership or confidential relationship between Schlumberger and the Swansons\nthat would give rise to a fiduciary duty on Schlumberger's part.\n\n\n\n                                             III.

The Swansons had seen\nan April 1986 Schlumberger evaluation that described the project as “economical,” but noted that the “commerciality” of the\nproject would not be *178 determined until 1988 or 1989. Despite the 1986 evaluation, and without having undertaken any\nlater studies, Schlumberger represented to the Swansons that the project was neither technologically feasible nor commercially\nviable. In addition, Schlumberger represented that the project had a negative value and that Sedswan would be lucky to get\nout with its costs.\n\n [10] At trial, the evidence was undisputed that there are diamonds on the ocean floor off South Africa. It was further undisputed\nthat, as of the time of trial in 1993, no one had begun mining diamonds. Also, it was undisputed that Seltrust's successor sold its\ninterest to DeBeers in 1992 for only slightly more than its project costs. On the other hand, there was substantial dispute about\nwhether the project was technologically feasible or commercially viable. Schlumberger brings a point of error asserting that\nthere is legally insufficient evidence of fraud, but it does not argue in its briefing in this Court that its representations about the\nproject's technological or commercial infeasibility were immaterial, were merely opinion, or were either not knowingly made\nor not made without knowledge of the truth.

Texas law does not support such a rule.\n\n [11] Texas law favors and encourages voluntary settlements and orderly dispute resolution. However, a release is a contract,\nand like any other contract, is subject to avoidance on grounds such as fraud or mistake. See Williams v.

We held that this constituted\nfraud sufficient to set aside the agreement, even though the written contract provided that no representations or guaranties had\nbeen made by the seller that were not expressed therein. “Promises made without intention of fulfillment, in order to induce\nothers to make contracts, are as culpable and as harmful as are willful misrepresentations of existing facts.

The seller brought\nsuit against the purchaser of a tractor and loader for the balance due on the purchase contract. The buyer counterclaimed for\nrescission, claiming that he was fraudulently induced to contract by false representations about the work capacities of the tractor\nand loader. The seller argued that a merger clause providing that the contract was “the entire contract relating to the sale and\nwarranty” of the equipment and that “no warranty is made or authorized to be made other than herein set forth” precluded the\nbuyer's fraudulent inducement claim. Id. at 234. In resolving the parties' dispute, we considered the two lines of cases discussed\npreviously and concluded that they represented conflicting lines of authority that could not be distinguished on any principled\nground. See id. at 238–39. We resolved the conflict by holding, as a matter of policy, that a merger clause can be avoided based\non fraud in the inducement and that the parol evidence rule does not bar proof of such fraud. See id. at 239. In doing so, we\nbrought the law on the subject “into harmony with the great weight of authority, with the rule of the Restatement of the Law\nof Contracts, and with the views of eminent textwriters.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\nJuxtaposed to this authority, we have a competing concern—the ability of parties to fully and finally resolve disputes between\nthem. Parties should be able to bargain for and execute a release barring all further dispute. This principle necessarily\ncontemplates that parties may disclaim reliance on representations. And such a disclaimer, where the parties' intent is clear and\nspecific, should be effective to negate a fraudulent inducement claim. As an example, a disclaimer of reliance may conclusively\nnegate the element of reliance, which is essential to a fraudulent inducement claim. See Prudential, 896 S.W.2d at 161–62\n(holding that agreement to buy property “as is,” in which buyer included “voluntary, freely negotiated affirmation that he was\ndepending on his own assessment of the building,” precluded claim for damages when building was found to contain asbestos);\nEstes v.

We conclude that our well-established rules\nof contract interpretation govern whether the Swansons gave the requisite clear and unequivocal expression of intent necessary\nto disclaim reliance on these specific representations by Schlumberger.

Schlumberger never convinced the Swansons that DeBeers' offer was a good deal; four days\nbefore he signed the release, John Swanson wrote to his attorney that the Swansons' lease interest was “worth billions.” The\nSwansons seriously considered suing Schlumberger even before the sale to DeBeers and Seltrust. Indeed, the release states that\nthe Swansons claimed that they had an interest in the mining consortium and in Schlumberger's prospecting lease, and that\nSchlumberger was “liable to the Swansons in connection with the prospecting or exploration of diamonds or other precious\nstones or minerals in South Africa.” In this connection, the release recites that\n\n            there is considerable doubt, disagreement, dispute and controversy with reference to the validity of the\n            Swansons' claim against [Schlumberger] and as to the legal or moral liability of [Schlumberger] for any\n            amount of damages or justification for legal relief, and there is further doubt, disagreement, uncertainty\n            and confusion as to the amount of said liability, if any.\n\nFurther, the Swansons released all “causes of action of whatsoever nature, or any other legal theory arising out of the\ncircumstances described above, from any and all liability damages of any kind known or unknown, whether in contract or tort.”\nThe sole purpose of the release was to end the dispute about the value of this commercial project between Schlumberger and\nthe Swansons once and for all.\n\nIn this context and in clear language, the Swansons unequivocally disclaimed reliance upon representations by Schlumberger\nabout the project's feasibility and value. They said:\n\n            [E]ach of us [the Swansons] expressly warrants and represents and does hereby state ... and represent ...\n            that no promise or agreement which is not herein expressed has been made to him or her in executing\n            this release, and that none of us is relying upon any statement or representation of any agent of the\n            parties being released hereby.

Therefore, we conclude that the disclaimer of reliance is binding and, as a matter of law, precludes\nthe Swansons' claim that they were fraudulently induced to sell their interest in the sea-diamond project.\n\n *181 [13] In sum, we hold that a release that clearly expresses the parties' intent to waive fraudulent inducement claims, or\none that disclaims reliance on representations about specific matters in dispute, can preclude a claim of fraudulent inducement.\nWe emphasize that a disclaimer of reliance or merger clause will not always bar a fraudulent inducement claim. See Prudential,\n896 S.W.2d at 162 (identifying some circumstances in which “as is” clause would not preclude fraudulent inducement claim).\nWe conclude only that on this record, the disclaimer of reliance conclusively negates as a matter of law the element of\nreliance on representations about the feasibility and value of the sea-diamond mining project needed to support the Swansons'\nclaim of fraudulent inducement.

Johnson is not pertinent\nto our discussion because, as we have said, there is no evidence of a partnership or other confidential relationship between\nSchlumberger and the Swansons.\n\n [16] Even so, the Swansons assert that the disclaimer of reliance is nonetheless immaterial because it does not disclaim reliance\non Schlumberger's non-disclosures; it does not say, for example, that “none of us is relying on Schlumberger for accurate\nreports about the project.” Schlumberger responds that the language of the disclaimer of reliance expressly covers claims for\nboth affirmative statements and non-disclosures. In particular, Schlumberger asserts that the alleged non-disclosures are merely\nthe converse of the misrepresentations; the disclaimer of reliance covers any “non-disclosures” that are the equivalent of the\nrepresentations on which the Swansons disclaimed reliance. We agree with Schlumberger.\n\nIn support of their argument, the Swansons reiterate the evidence that in April 1986 Schlumberger had a report that positively\n *182 assessed the technological and economic feasibility of the sea-diamond project, yet in 1987 and 1988, after Schlumberger\ndecided to withdraw Sedswan from the joint venture, Schlumberger made statements and disclosures to the Swansons indicating\nthat the technology was unworkable and the project would not be commercially feasible. Had Schlumberger disclosed the\ngeological, economic, and technical data available to it, the Swansons contend that they would have been able to make their own\nassessment and determine that there had been no adverse developments since April 1986. In short, had Schlumberger disclosed\nall the true facts about the project, it would not have affirmatively misrepresented the truth. The Swansons' non-disclosure\nallegations are simply the converse of Schlumberger's affirmative misrepresentations and are covered by the disclaimer of\nreliance.\n\n\n\n                          V. SECTION 27.01 OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS & COMMERCE CODE\n\nIn addition to finding breach of fiduciary duty and common-law fraud, the jury found that Schlumberger committed fraud in\nconnection with a real estate transaction in violation of section 27.01 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. TEX. BUS.\n& COM.CODE § 27.01. Schlumberger contends that section 27.01 does not apply to the Swansons' interest in the sea-diamond\nproject. Schlumberger argues that the Swansons' interest at most was an interest in a prospecting lease off the South African\ncoast, which under both South African and Texas law is a personal property interest, and not an interest in real estate.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Lessor also asserted a third-\nparty claim. Lessee and third-party filed motion to enforce settlement agreement. Lessor moved to continue the hearing on\nmotion to enforce. The 16th District Court, Denton County, Carmen Rivera-Worley, J., recessed the hearing, ordered parties to\nreturn to mediation, and awarded lessee and third-party attorney fees. After mediation failed, lessee and third-party reasserted\nclaims and added claim for breach of the memorandum of settlement. Denying lessor's request for jury trial, the District Court\ngranted motion to enforce settlement agreement. Lessor moved for new trial and District Court denied. Lessor appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Dixon W. Holman, J., held that:\n\n[1] lessor's failure to timely file notice of appeal of denial of its motion for new trial did not require dismissal of appeal;\n\n[2] lessor's claim of error for denial of jury trial on lessee's breach of contract claim was moot;\n\n[3] lessor was foreclosed from challenge the motion to enforce; and\n\n[4] award of attorney fees was warranted.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n West Headnotes (9)\n\n\n [1]     Appeal and Error          Relief from effect of failure\n         Lessor's failure to timely file notice of appeal of trial court denial of its motion for new trial on lessee's breach of lease\n         and fraud claims did not require appeal to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; letter from appellate court granted\n         lessor twelve days to show reasonable explanation of late filing of the notice of appeal, lessor provided a reasonable\n         explanation for the late filing, and, although the notice of appeal recited that it was being taken to a different appellate\n         court, the lessor timely amended its notice to cure the error.

Scott Trust (“Appellants,” if jointly) appeal from an order\ngranting an amended motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Appellants and Appellees Diana Taffarello and Robert\nL. Soltis (“Appellees,” if jointly). In five issues, Appellants complain that the trial court erred as a matter of law by granting\nthe amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement, that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their request for\na jury trial and by awarding attorneys' fees to Appellees, and that the filing of a notice of settlement constitutes an unlawful\ntaking of property in violation of the United States and Texas Constitutions.

Taffarello alleged that she had entered into a real property\nlease with Appellants and that Appellants later agreed to sell her the leased property. According to the petition, however,\nAppellants subsequently advised Taffarello that they would not sell the property to her. In addition to seeking a declaratory\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                3\n\fScott-Richter v. Taffarello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2355145\"><a href=\"/opinion/2355145/scott-richter-v-taffarello/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006)\n\n\njudgment regarding her right to continued possession of the property, Taffarello asserted claims for breach of the real estate\ncontract, fraud, and breach of a lease agreement. Appellants answered Taffarello's petition and asserted a third-party claim\nagainst Soltis.\n\nThe parties went to mediation on July 14, 2004 and agreed to a number of terms as evidenced in a written Memorandum\nof *185 Settlement (“Memorandum”). The Memorandum, among other things, indicates that Taffarello's lawsuit is to be\ndismissed, describes how the net proceeds of the sale are to be divided after the property is sold, provides for the drafting of\na “compromise settlement agreement” and “trust agreement,” and designates a settlement closing date of August 13, 2004,\nwhich the parties later agreed to extend by two weeks. In mid-August, counsel for Appellants allegedly advised Taffarello that\nthey would no longer negotiate regarding the settlement documents. Appellants' counsel also filed a motion to withdraw and\na motion to abate the case.\n\nAppellees responded with a letter dated August 24, 2004, which demanded that Appellants engage in good faith negotiations\nin regard to the remaining settlement documents and that the parties return to mediation. Appellees received no response to the\nletter, and consequently, the parties were unable to reach an agreement regarding the preparation of the additional documents\ncontemplated by the Memorandum. As such, the parties did not close on the designated date, and Appellees filed a motion to\nenforce the settlement agreement on September 17, 2004; they amended the motion on October 7.\n\nAppellees' amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement requested that the trial court declare, among other things, that\nthe Memorandum is a binding Rule 11 settlement agreement, 1 that the “Compromise and Settlement Agreement” attached to\nthe motion is the compromise settlement agreement specified in the Memorandum, that the “Cole Richter Irrevocable Trust\nAgreement” also attached to the motion is the trust instrument specified in the Memorandum, and that the “Notice of Settlement”\nattached to the motion is “proper and appropriate.”\n\nOn October 13, 2004, the trial court heard arguments on the pending motions, which included a motion filed by Appellants to\ncontinue the hearing on the motion to enforce because of their attorney's pending motion to withdraw. The trial court ultimately\ngranted Appellants' counsel's motion to withdraw, recessed the hearing on the amended motion to enforce the settlement\nagreement until a later date, ordered the parties to return to mediation, and awarded Appellees $5,000 in attorneys' fees.\n\nThe parties returned to mediation but were unable to reach a compromise regarding the terms of the Memorandum calling for\nfurther agreement. On November 15, 2004, Appellees filed their first amended petition and third-party defendant counterclaims,\nwhich, in addition to re-asserting claims for breach of the real estate contract and lease agreement, asserted a claim for breach\nof the Memorandum. On November 19, 2004, the parties entered into a second Rule 11 agreement, which partially provided:\n\n            We have agreed that your clients, Allison Scott, a/k/a Allison Scott–Richter, individually, and as Trustee\n            of the Thomas Eugene Scott, Jr., Living Trust, and as Trustee of the Allison L. Scott Trust (collectively,\n            “Scott”), will not challenge the validity or enforceability of the Memorandum of Settlement dated July\n            14, 2004 (the “Memorandum”) by and between Scott and Diana Taffarello (“Taffarello”) and Robert\n            Soltis, Jr. (“Soltis”). In particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Scott agrees not\n            to raise lack of competency, duress, lack of essential term(s), tax effect or consequences, violation of\n            any other trust, or any other matter as a *186 bar or defense to the Memorandum. Scott further agrees\n            that she will not challenge or contest the Amended Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement filed by\n            Taffarello and Soltis. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\nNotwithstanding this language, Appellants filed a request for a jury trial on December 14, 2004. The trial court heard the\namended motion to enforce the settlement agreement three days later on December 17, and despite Appellants' arguments that\nthey were entitled to a jury trial on Taffarello's breach of contract claim, the trial court granted the motion to enforce.\n\nAppellants filed a motion for new trial on January 18, 2005, which the trial court subsequently denied.

JURISDICTION\n\nWe begin our analysis by determining whether we have jurisdiction to consider this matter. Appellees assert that this appeal\nshould be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Appellants' notice of appeal was not timely filed. We disagree.\n\n [1] The trial court signed its final judgment on December 17, 2004. Appellants timely filed a motion for new trial; therefore,\nAppellants' notice of appeal was due on or before March 17, 2005. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 26.1(a)(1). On March 30, 2005, Appellants\nfiled their notice of appeal with the District Clerk of Denton County, Texas. On April 6, 2005, we notified Appellants of our\nconcern that the notice of appeal was not timely filed. We informed Appellants that if we did not receive a response from them\nwithin twelve days showing a reasonable explanation for the late filing of the notice of appeal, the appeal could be dismissed for\nwant of jurisdiction. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 10.5(b), 26.3(b), 42.3(a); Jones v. City of Houston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460726\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460726/jones-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 677 (Tex.1998);\nVerburgt v.

Because Appellants' motion was\nnot filed within fifteen days of the date the notice of appeal was due, we were not authorized to grant the motion, and we took\nno action on the motion. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 26.3. However, inasmuch as Appellants filed their notice of appeal with the proper\ntrial court clerk within fifteen days of the due date, a motion for extension of time was necessarily implied. See Verburgt, 959\nS.W.2d at 617 (holding a motion for extension of time is necessarily implied when an appellant acting in good faith files a\ndocument attempting to perfect the appeal beyond the time allowed by the appellate rules, but within the fifteen-day period in\nwhich the appellant would be entitled to move to extend the filing deadline).\n\nAccordingly, we construed Appellants' motion as a response to our April 6, 2005 letter questioning our jurisdiction.\nConsequently, the question before us was whether Appellants provided a reasonable explanation for the late filing of their\nnotice of appeal within the fifteen-day period of Rule 26.3. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 26.3; Hone v. Hanafin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1616709\"><a href=\"/opinion/1616709/hone-v-hanafin/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 886–87\n(Tex.2003); Jones, 976 S.W.2d at 677;Verburgt, 959 S.W.2d at 617. Appellants explained that their failure to timely file their\nnotice of appeal was not deliberate or intentional, but was the result of inadvertence, mistake, or mischance in the calculation of\nthe deadline and the mis-docketing of such date on the calendar of Appellants' counsel. On April 18, 2005, we issued an order\nfinding that Appellants had provided a reasonable explanation for the late filing of their notice of appeal.\n\n *187 Appellees filed a motion asking us to reconsider our order.

REQUEST FOR JURY TRIAL\n\n [2] In their first issue, Appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their request for a jury trial. They\ncontend that their demand for a jury trial was timely and that their federal constitutional rights under the Seventh Amendment\nto the United States Constitution, their state constitutional rights under Article 5, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution, and\ntheir statutory rights under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 216 were violated. Appellees respond that Appellants' request for a\njury trial pertains only to Appellees' breach of contract claim, which was abandoned by Appellees and dismissed by the order\ngranting the amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement and final judgment. We agree.\n\nAppellants argued repeatedly during the hearing on the amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement that they were\nentitled to a jury trial on Appellees' breach of contract (Memorandum) claim. Counsel for Appellants argued,\n\n             In that First Amended Petition ... Mr. Spoede asserted a claim for breach of contract of the Settlement\n             Agreement and a claim for declaratory judgment. Both of those claims are claims that under *188 Article\n             5, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution, these defendants are entitled to a trial by jury on those claims.\n\nCounsel continued,\n\n  [I]f the Court construes, and we believe the Court cannot reach any other conclusion but that there are still two breaches\n  of Settlement Agreement—two causes of action still outstanding, then this matter needs to go ahead and proceed to trial in\n  February as the Court currently has it set.\n\n  ....\n\n  [I]f they are asserting a claim for breach of contract, they're required to prove the breach of contract.... My clients have\n  the right, based on the current state of the pleadings, to do discovery on this claim of breach of contract and declaratory\n  judgment, to call witnesses, to have documents produced, to take depositions, and most important, to try to have a jury trial\n  in connection with this.\n\nFinally, counsel argued,\n\n             We believe that the Court ought to set this matter for trial, that Ms. Scott and the remaining defendants\n             ought to be allowed the opportunity as they are given the right under the Texas Constitution to defend\n             against the claims of breach of contract and the declaratory judgment claims....\n\nCounsel for Appellees, however, responded that they were withdrawing the breach of contract claim. He said,\n\n             Once he [opposing counsel] signed the Rule 11 Agreement saying that he wouldn't oppose our Amended\n             Motion to Enforce, it made everything moot. Everything settled except for the issue of attorney's fees.\n             So to the extent we do have other—the same claims couched as other causes of action, we withdraw\n             those causes of action because [the trial court's] order gives us all the relief we were seeking in the first\n             place. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court, in response to a question by Appellants regarding the effect of the order as it\nrelates to the breach of contract claim, stated it understood that Appellees were “abandoning or waiving many of those claims.”\nCounsel for Appellees responded that the order “speaks for itself.” Indeed, the order signed by the trial court provides that\n“[a]ny claims in this lawsuit that are not specifically addressed in this Order and Judgment, including all claims, counter-claims,\ncross-claims, and third-party claims, are dismissed with prejudice to the refiling of same.”\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellants' request for a jury trial.\nWe overrule Appellants' first issue.\n\n\n\n                                V. AMENDED MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT\n                                AGREEMENT AND CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES\n\nIn their second issue, Appellants argue that the trial court erred as a matter of law by granting the amended motion to enforce\nthe settlement agreement because it had the effect of imposing additional material terms to the agreement that the parties had\nyet to negotiate and agree upon. Appellants contend that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that they agreed to be\nbound by the compromise settlement agreement, trust agreement, and notice of settlement and that the issue of whether they\nagreed to be bound by the terms of these agreements should have been set for a jury trial. In their third issue, Appellants argue\n—without citing any authority—that the denial of their right to a jury trial on these issues denied them due process under the\nTexas and federal constitutions and constituted an unlawful taking of property under the Fifth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. In their fourth issue, Appellants argue—without citing any authority-that the filing of the “Notice of Settlement”\nin Denton County results in an unconstitutional taking of property. Appellees respond that the November 19, 2004 Rule 11\nagreement resolved any dispute as to the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the documents drafted to effectuate\nit. We agree.\n\n [3] [4] [5] Pursuant to Rule 11, no agreement between the parties or their attorneys shall be enforceable unless the agreement\nis either (1) in writing, signed by the parties, and filed with the papers as part of the record or (2) made orally in open court\nand entered as part of the record.

Despite the valid Rule 11\nagreement entered into by the parties, Appellants now attempt to challenge the “Compromise and Settlement Agreement,” the\n“Cole Richter Irrevocable Trust Agreement,” and the “Notice of Settlement” by arguing that they never agreed to the terms\ncontained therein and by arguing that their rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions have been denied. This\nthey cannot do. Appellants expressly agreed not to challenge the amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement. By so\nagreeing, they foreclosed their ability to complain on appeal regarding the terms of the motion and subsequent order granting\nthe same. As Appellees state in their brief,\n\n            By executing the Nov. 19 Rule 11 Agreement, counsel resolved the very issues he now attempts to\n            challenge in this appeal: the enforceability of the mediated settlement agreement and the documents\n            drafted to effectuate it.... Moreover, the amended motion to enforce incorporates each of the documents\n            Scott now claims go beyond the settlement agreement. Appellants agreed to each one by agreeing not\n            to contest the amended motion to enforce.\n\n\nThe trial court's order granting Appellees' motion to enforce the settlement agreement and final judgment tracks the language\nin the motion closely and states,\n\n  1. The Memorandum of Settlement entered into by the parties and dated July 14, 2004, is declared to be a binding and effective\n  settlement agreement that is enforceable under contract law and under Rule 11of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure....\n\n  2.... The Compromise and Settlement Agreement is hereby declared to constitute the compromise settlement agreement\n  specified in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum of Settlement, and to be a final and binding agreement of all of the parties as\n  if each party hereto had properly signed and executed it....\n\n  3.... The Cole Richter Irrevocable Trust Agreement is hereby declared to be that trust instrument or agreement specified\n  or referenced in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Memorandum of Settlement, and in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Compromise and\n  Settlement Agreement, and shall be fully enforceable and effective as if properly signed and executed by each of the parties....\n\n  4. The document attached as Exhibit “B” to the Compromise and Settlement Agreement [entitled Notice of Settlement and\n  Net Sales Proceeds Interest] is hereby declared to be proper and appropriate. Taffarello may sign and file the Memorandum\n  in the real property records of Denton County, Texas.\n\nAppellants never challenged the validity and enforceability of the November 19, 2004 Rule 11 agreement (e.g., by attacking it\non the grounds of fraud or mistake or by arguing that an exception applies), and they do not raise such a challenge on appeal.\nAnd the Rule 11 agreement is clear and unambiguous. Accordingly, because Appellants agreed not to challenge or contest the\namended motion to enforce the settlement agreement pursuant to a *191 valid Rule 11 agreement, the trial court did not err by\nperforming its ministerial duty and granting Appellees' amended motion to enforce the settlement agreement.

P. 33.1(a)(1)(A). After counsel for Appellees requested $5,000 in attorneys' fees, the trial court asked for a\nresponse from Appellants' counsel, who stated, “Well, obviously, we oppose that.” The trial court indicated thereafter that it was\nawarding Appellees the attorneys' fees. Appellants also fail to cite one single authority for each of the three arguments raised\nin their brief. SeeTEX.R.APP. P. 38.1(h). Accordingly, Appellants failed to preserve these arguments for appellate review.\n\n [9] Nonetheless, Appellants' arguments are unpersuasive. Appellants were not without counsel at the time the trial court\nawarded Appellees attorneys' fees. The record clearly indicates that the trial court awarded Appellees attorneys' fees before\ngranting Appellants' counsel's motion to withdraw. Moreover, as demonstrated above, the trial court afforded Appellants an\nopportunity to argue against the request for attorneys' fees. Regarding Appellants' prematurity argument, the trial court had\ntwo subsequent opportunities to consider the award; Appellants filed their “Motion for Reconsideration or to Set Aside Order\nGranting Attorney's Fees” on December 16, 2004 and motion for new trial on January 18, 2005. The trial court ultimately\nupheld the award of attorneys' fees. Appellants lastly argue that they are entitled to a jury trial on the issue of attorneys' fees\nbecause “the right to such recovery was necessarily predicated upon Appellees' successful prosecution of their claims that the\nMemorandum was an enforceable agreement and that the Appellants had breached it.” However, as we discussed in Section IV\nabove, Appellees waived their breach of contract claim in open court, and the order granting their amended motion to enforce\nthe settlement agreement expressly dismisses all claims not addressed in the order, which includes Appellees' breach of contract\nclaim. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Appellees attorneys' fees. Accordingly, we overrule\nAppellants' fifth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                           VII. CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled all of Appellants' issues, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      TEX.R. CIV.

We will affirm the trial court's order denying Ruiz's second application; *774 we will dismiss the\nTABC's appeal as moot.\n\n\n\n                                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe procedural background of this case is complex. Because the procedural posture defines the parameters of the issues before\nthis Court, we will describe the history of this dispute in detail.\n\nAt the core of this controversy is the proper construction of section 102.52 of the Alcoholic Beverage Code as amended by the\n73rd Legislature in 1993. Before its amendment, the section provided:\n\n             (a) Nothing in Section 102.51 of this code limits or alters the right of a holder of a general, local, or\n             branch distributor's license to sell beer to any other holder of a general, local, or branch distributor's\n             license, except that a distributor who has purchased beer from another distributor may distribute and\n             sell the beer only within a territory for which the manufacturer of the brand has designated that it may\n             be sold by a distributor.\n\nAct of March 29, 1979, 66th Leg., R.S., ch. 33, § 9, 1979 Tex.Gen.Laws 53, 55 (Tex.Alco.Bev.Code Ann. § 102.52(a), since\namended) (emphasis added).\n\nIn 1993, the Legislature amended the last portion of the section to read “except that a distributor who has purchased beer from\nanother distributor may distribute and sell the beer only within a territory for which the manufacturer of the brand has designated\nthat it may be sold by the general, local, or branch distributor making the purchase.” Act of May 30, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S.,\nch. 934, § 67, 1993 Tex.Gen.Laws 3950, 3975 (Tex.Alco.Bev.Code Ann. § 102.52) (emphasis added). Ruiz and the TABC\ndispute whether this amendment to section 102.52 now requires local beer distributors to have territorial agreements with beer\nmanufacturers before such distributors can resell beer purchased from another distributor.\n\nOn September 28, 1993, Ruiz filed suit for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the TABC. Ruiz alleged\nentitlement to a temporary injunction enjoining the TABC from enforcing section 102.52 on four grounds: (1) procedural\ninvalidity for noncompliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and due-course-of-law provision of the Texas Constitution\nwhen the TABC announced its intent to enforce the section, (2) violation of constitutional rights to due process and equal\nprotection, (3) inconsistency with other sections of the Alcoholic Beverage Code, and (4) lack of authority for the TABC to\nenact an unconstitutional rule.\n\nOn October 18, 1993, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Ruiz's application for temporary injunction. In its first\norder, dated January 20, 1994, the court found section 102.52 ambiguous and construed it as not requiring local beer distributors\nto obtain manufacturers' territorial agreements. Concluding there was a probable right to recover on the merits, the court issued\na temporary injunction against TABC enforcement of the provision. The TABC timely perfected an appeal from this order in\nour cause number 3–93–618–CV.\n\n\nSilver Eagle Distributors, Inc. (“Silver Eagle”), an intervenor below, did not appeal this initial order by the trial court. 2 Rather,\nSilver Eagle filed a motion for rehearing, which the trial court granted. In a second order, dated January 27, 1994, the court\ndetermined that the temporary injunction should not have been issued because the court's preliminary interpretation of amended\nsection 102.52 was incorrect. The court concluded that section 102.52 “requires that when a distributor (the ‘purchasing\ndistributor’) purchases beer from another distributor, the purchasing distributor may only resell that beer in the territory assigned\nto the purchasing distributor by the manufacturer of the beer.” The court dissolved the temporary injunction it had issued only the\nweek before. Significantly, Ruiz did not appeal this January 27, 1994 order dissolving the temporary injunction and construing\nsection 102.52. Meanwhile, the TABC's appeal from the trial court's first order remained pending in this Court.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This notification letter, which included a copy of the trial court's order, simply stated that the\norder was “self-explanatory” and advised distributors to “make sure that you are in compliance with the law.”\n\nOn March 28, 1994, Ruiz filed in the trial court a second application for temporary injunctive relief. This second request\nreiterated all of the grounds asserted in Ruiz's initial application and also included three claims that were essentially new: (1) the\nrequirement of territorial agreements constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of power to beer wholesalers; (2) the requirement\nis an unconstitutional suspension of law; and (3) territorial agreements operate as an unreasonable restraint violating the Texas\nAntitrust Act. 3 Following another hearing, the trial court, in an order dated May 10, 1994, denied Ruiz's second application for\ntemporary injunctive relief on the grounds that Ruiz had failed to show probable right to recover and probable injury. Further, the\ncourt found that claims of adverse action by the TABC were not ripe for consideration. Finally, the court expressed no opinion\n“on the alleged absence of standards to guide the discretion of the licensing authority in the implementation or application of\nSection 102.52.” Ruiz perfected an interlocutory appeal from this May 10, 1994 order in our cause number 3–94–269–CV.\n\n\n\n                                                          DISCUSSION\n\nIn its first point of error, Ruiz asserts that the trial court adopted an erroneous construction of section 102.52 of the Alcoholic\nBeverage Code. Given the procedural history described above, it is imperative that we identify precisely the issues that are\nproperly before this Court in these interlocutory appeals.\n\n\nA. January 20, 1994 Order Granting Temporary Injunction\n [1] The TABC properly appealed the validity of the initial January 20, 1994 order granting Ruiz a temporary injunction.\nHowever, the trial court subsequently granted a rehearing and, in its January 27, 1994 order, dissolved the injunction. The issue\nof whether an injunction is valid becomes moot when the injunction ceases to have effect.

Because the trial court dissolved the temporary injunction\non rehearing, the TABC's appeal of the January 20, 1994 order is moot. We lack jurisdiction when an appeal is moot. See id.\n\n\nB. January 27, 1994 Order Dissolving Temporary Injunction\n [2] When the trial court reconsidered its temporary injunction, it renounced its earlier interpretation of section 102.52 and\nconcluded that the statute requires that all purchasing distributors, including local distributors, have manufacturers' territorial\nagreements. Consequently, the court dissolved the previously granted temporary injunction. This order constituted a denial of\ntemporary injunctive relief, from which Ruiz did not appeal. An interlocutory order that is not timely appealed is not reviewable\nby this Court. See Desai v. Reliance Mach.

Although Ruiz argues vigorously that\nthe trial court did not correctly construe section 102.52 in its January 27, 1994 order, Ruiz's failure to perfect an interlocutory\nappeal from that order precludes this Court from reviewing its validity.\n\n\nC. May 10, 1994 Order Denying Second Request for Temporary Injunction\nAfter the time to appeal the dissolution of the previously granted temporary injunction had passed, Ruiz filed a second\napplication for temporary injunctive relief. Following *776 another evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied this second\nrequest. Ruiz perfected an interlocutory appeal from this May 10, 1994 order.\n\nIn points of error two and three, Ruiz asserts that the trial court erred in “refusing to restrain the TABC's enforcement of its\ninterpretation of section 102.52” and in “refusing to enjoin the application of section 102.52.” However, in the subparts of these\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Because of Ruiz's misconception of the scope of a second request for injunctive relief\nand the appropriate standard of review in this interlocutory appeal, the issues we must address are considerably narrowed.\n\n\n1. Scope of a Second Request for Injunctive Relief\n [3] [4] Ordinarily, the dissolution of a temporary injunction bars a second application for such injunctive relief, unless the\nsecond request is based on changed circumstances not known at the time of the first application. See Ellis v. Lamb–McAshan Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3934571\"><a href=\"/opinion/4167755/ellis-v-lamb-mcashan-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1925, writ dism'd); Birchfield v. Bourland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3958121\"><a href=\"/opinion/4188599/birchfield-v-bourland/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nFort Worth 1916, no writ); see also 43A C.J.S. Injunctions § 278 (1978). Successive applications for injunctive relief on grounds\nthat could have been raised in connection with an earlier request for such relief are not allowed where there is insufficient\nreason why the grounds were not urged in the earlier application. Ellis, 278 S.W. at 862. This restriction on the scope of\nsuccessive requests for the extraordinary remedy of a temporary injunction sensibly deters piecemeal litigation, conserves\njudicial resources, and prohibits litigants from receiving “two bites at the apple.” Cf. Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835.\n\n [5] Ruiz's second application for temporary injunction provides no valid basis on which the trial court could have granted\nrelief. The challenges to the procedural and substantive validity of the requirement and the constitutional due process and equal\nprotection arguments in Ruiz's second request duplicate those in its initial request. Moreover, all of the “new grounds” alleged\nin the second application—improper delegation of power, invalid suspension of law, and violation of the Texas Antitrust Act\n—were clearly available to Ruiz when it made its initial request for injunctive relief. Consequently, there is no basis on which\nthe trial court could have abused its discretion in denying Ruiz's second request.\n\n [6] Additionally, there are no changed circumstances that would allow Ruiz to reurge its request for an injunction or generate\nnew grounds for relief. The only thing that occurred between the dissolution of the injunction and Ruiz's second request was the\nTABC notification letter. 5 This brief notice merely informed beer distributors that the previous injunction had been dissolved\nand that distributors should comply with section 102.52. This in no way amounts to a change in circumstances warranting a\nsecond attempt at injunctive relief. Throughout the proceedings, the TABC consistently maintained that section 102.52 required\nall beer distributors to have manufacturers' territorial agreements before purchasing beer from *777 another distributor for\nresale. A letter restating this position is not a changed circumstance, nor was it unknown at the time of the initial application.\nIt does not, therefore, permit a second request for an injunction. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Ruiz's second request.\n\n\n2. Review of a Denial of a Temporary Injunction\n [7] [8] An equally fundamental misconception also pervades Ruiz's appeal. This is an appeal of an interlocutory order.\nAppellate review of an order denying a temporary injunction is strictly limited to a determination of whether there has been a\nclear abuse of discretion. Davis v. Huey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443943\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443943/davis-v-huey/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (Tex.1978).

Rather, the entire thrust of Ruiz's argument\ngoes to the merits of its many challenges to section 102.52 and its enforcement by the TABC. We decline to reach the merits of\nthese claims without allowing the trial court an opportunity to render a final judgment on them.

When no findings of fact or conclusions of law are filed, the trial court's order must be\nupheld on any legal theory supported by the record. Davis, 571 S.W.2d at 862.\n\n [12] In its May 10, 1994 order, the trial court found that the second request for injunctive relief should be denied because, inter\nalia, the evidence presented was insufficient to show probable injury. At the hearing on its second request, Ruiz offered the\ntestimony of only one witness, Reecie Dunn, a local distributor. Dunn testified that the TABC had not cited him or threatened\nhim with any action for failure to have a territorial agreement.\n\n\nThe only other evidence admitted at the hearing consisted of two letters from beer manufacturers to Mary Boggs. 6 The first,\nfrom Miller Brewing Company, dated January 28, 1994, responds to a January 26, 1994 inquiry by stating that Miller was aware\nof the court ruling but was unable to respond to “your request” until the TABC informs the company what manufacturers can\nand cannot do. Given that it is unclear what the request was and whether the court ruling mentioned was the initial January 20,\n1994 order or later January 27, 1994 order, this is not conclusive evidence of probable injury.\n\nThe second letter, from Anheuser–Busch, also dated January 28, 1994, merely states that the company already has a contractual\nagreement granting an exclusive territorial agreement to another distributor. Given this paucity of evidence, the trial court\ncertainly did not abuse its discretion when it refused to find probable injury.\n\n\n\n                                                          *778 CONCLUSION\n\nWe dismiss the TABC's appeal in cause number 3–93–618–CV as moot, because the trial court has dissolved the injunction\nfrom which the appeal was taken. In cause number 3–94–269–CV, we overrule Ruiz's points of error and affirm the trial-court\norder denying Ruiz's second application for an injunction. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying this relief,\nboth because Ruiz was not entitled to seek successive injunctive relief and because Ruiz failed to carry its burden of proof\non probable injury.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      The Ruiz Wholesale Co. litigants also include: Ruiz Wholesale Co.

However, the initial request for injunctive\n       relief included this constitutional challenge.\n4      This contention was not raised to the trial court in Ruiz's second request for injunctive relief.

As a result of TxDOT's decision to make Highway 290 a controlled-access highway\nalong the length of Sunset Valley, several streets that had previously crossed or run alongside the old ground-level highway\nwere affected. Jones Road, an important municipal artery, was one of the streets affected, and a substantial portion of it had to\nbe closed. This street had served as a vital transportation link that the residents of Sunset Valley, as well as its police officers and\nother emergency personnel, had used to commute between the central and southwestern portions of the city. After the closure,\ntravel between the two portions was possible only by traveling along Highway 290's access road to a point outside the city,\ncrossing under, and then doubling back along the opposite side of Highway 290.\n\nSunset Valley has since found it necessary to construct a substitute street in order to regain the transportation connection it lost\nas a result of the expansion. The question of who should pay for this substitute street, along with a multitude of other issues\ninvolved in the construction and completion of Highway 290, was presented to the district court. Sunset Valley also raised\nissues of noise and light pollution, charging that TxDOT had failed to perform state and federally mandated noise-abatement\nprocedures and studies. Sunset Valley moved for partial, interlocutory summary judgment, and TxDOT responded by filing a\nplea to the jurisdiction along with several special exceptions to Sunset Valley's pleadings. The district court denied TxDOT's\nplea and special exceptions and granted Sunset Valley's motion for partial, interlocutory summary judgment on November 9,\n1998. The court found that Sunset Valley proved all the elements of inverse condemnation as a matter of law and that the\nsubstitute facilities doctrine was the proper method of determining the amount of damages incurred by Sunset Valley. The trial\ncourt also found that Sunset Valley was entitled to declaratory relief with respect to its noise pollution claims, but that it was\nnot entitled to relief in the form of an injunction or mandamus. TxDOT now challenges the district court's denial of its plea to\nthe jurisdiction in this interlocutory appeal, arguing (1) that Sunset Valley lacks standing to sue for inverse condemnation, (2)\nthat Sunset Valley lacks standing to bring its claims for damages resulting from increased circuity of travel and noise and light\npollution, and (3) that TxDOT is immune from suit for declaratory relief by virtue of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n\n\n\n                                                           DISCUSSION\n\nInterlocutory Appeal\n [1] [2] [3] [4] In bringing this appeal, TxDOT must of necessity rely solely on section 51.014(a)(8) of the Texas Civil\nPractice and Remedies Code, which provides that “[a] person may appeal from an interlocutory order of a district court that\ngrants or denies a plea to the jurisdiction by a governmental unit as that term is defined in Section 101.001.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

TxDOT confuses the jurisdictional question of whether Sunset Valley has standing to bring a cause of action for the\nState's appropriation of city streets with the substantive issue of whether Sunset Valley should prevail on the merits of its\ncase. TxDOT is attempting to meld its appeal of the denial of its plea to the jurisdiction with an appeal of the partial summary\njudgment rendered against it by the trial court. 3 As we have stated previously, *731 this Court is not authorized to review\nthe merits of Sunset Valley's claims in this interlocutory appeal. We decline to permit TxDOT to use this interlocutory appeal\nas a vehicle to circumvent the bounds set by the statute in order to obtain judicial review of the merits of Sunset Valley's case\nbefore the district court has rendered a final judgment. 4\n\nCertainly, a city has standing to bring suit against the State for appropriation of that city's streets, regardless of whether its\naction is ultimately unsuccessful. TxDOT cites no case law in support of its contention that municipalities lack standing to sue\nthe State for the physical appropriation of city streets. Likewise, we are unable to find any authority supporting this argument.\nHere, Sunset Valley has pleaded that it has a justiciable interest in the street that was taken and that as a city, it has an interest\nin maintaining its streets for its residents. Cities have always had standing to litigate issues involving their entitlement to public\nproperty in suits against other state governmental entities. 5\n\n [9] In asserting a claim to the streets that run within its boundaries, Sunset Valley has shown that a controversy exists as\nto the nature and extent of its interest in its streets and the State's responsibility for compensation. The ultimate question of\nwhether Sunset Valley can prevail in its suit against TxDOT is a matter for the trial court to decide on the merits. “A plea to\nthe jurisdiction of the trial court is not sustainable where the contention is to the effect that the plaintiff has falsely stated a\nclaim which, in fact, is nonexistent, for this is a matter of defense on the merits.” Bernard Hanyard Enters., Inc. v. McBeath,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2397820\"><a href=\"/opinion/2397820/bernard-hanyard-enterprises-v-mcbeath/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (Tex.App.—Austin 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Because TxDOT has not presented this Court with a true\njurisdictional issue, we overrule appellant's first issue.\n\n\nCircuity of Travel, Noise and Light Pollution\n [10] Having determined that Sunset Valley has standing to sue for the physical taking of its streets, we now address TxDOT's\nargument that Sunset Valley has no standing to sue TxDOT for any injuries resulting from increased circuity of travel and the\nlight and noise pollution resulting from the expansion of Highway 290. In *732 support of this argument, TxDOT states in its\nbrief that whether there has been a material and substantial impairment of access or whether there exists an issue of increased\ncircuity of travel is a question of law that must be decided by the trial court. See State v. Wood Oil Distrib. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518075\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518075/state-v-wood-oil-distributing-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

TxDOT adds that the burden of proving a compensable impairment of access is upon the landowner and that\nif the reconfiguration has caused only an increased circuity of travel, any injury suffered by Sunset Valley is noncompensable.\nSee id.; State v. Westgate, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 906–7 (Tex.App.—Austin 1990), aff'd, Westgate v.

If a judicial determination of the issue of increased circuity of travel is necessary and the burden of proof is\nupon the landowner to prove a compensable impairment of access, surely that same landowner has standing to bring the action\nnecessary to receive this judicial determination. TxDOT cannot successfully argue that because a defense of circuity of travel\nmay exist, Sunset Valley has no standing to bring suit in the first place. TxDOT's circuity-of-travel contentions concern questions\nof compensable injuries and the measure of damages, which are questions on the merits, not jurisdictional issues. Likewise,\nTxDOT's argument that Sunset Valley's claims for injuries resulting from the noise and light pollution caused by the highway\nexpansion are not compensable again goes to the merits of the case and not to the jurisdictional issue of standing. The fact that\nSunset Valley has alleged injury to the public it represents is enough to confer standing. We overrule TxDOT's second issue.\n\n\nSovereign Immunity\n [12] In its third and final issue, TxDOT argues that the district court erred in denying its plea to the jurisdiction because it\nis immune from suit pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, specifically with respect to Sunset Valley's request for\ndeclaratory judgment on its noise and light pollution claims. TxDOT complains that this declaratory relief compels the State\nthrough its officials to perform certain acts without the required legislative consent. See Griffin v. Hawn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2426046\"><a href=\"/opinion/2426046/griffin-v-hawn/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153 (1960) (holding that where purpose of proceeding against state officials is to control action of State, suit is\nagainst State and cannot be maintained without legislature's consent).\n\nFirst, TxDOT mischaracterizes the trial court's judgment. In its partial, interlocutory summary judgment, the trial court granted\nTxDOT's jurisdictional challenge to Sunset Valley's request for relief by mandamus and denied Sunset Valley's request for an\ninjunction. The only relief that the court granted Sunset Valley was a declaratory judgment with respect to its claim for noise\npollution. Contrary to TxDOT's assertions, this relief does not require the State to take any action. The trial court expressly\nrejected any such relief when it denied Sunset Valley's requests for a mandamus and injunction.\n\n[13]    [14]   Furthermore, although the State as sovereign is generally immune from both liability and suit without its consent,\nactions for inverse condemnation brought pursuant to article I, section 17 of the Texas Constitution 6 comprise a limited\nexception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

Because Sunset Valley's entire claim is in the\nnature of a takings claim and the declaratory relief of which TxDOT complains involves a nuisance claim for noise and light\npollution, TxDOT cannot successfully assert sovereign immunity from suit. Accordingly, we overrule TxDOT's final issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\nHaving overruled all three issues TxDOT raised in this interlocutory appeal, we affirm the trial court's denial of TxDOT's plea\nto the jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The issues here are whether the district court had continuing jurisdiction\nover a trust it created under Chapter 142 of the Texas Trust Code, and whether the district court's order went beyond the\nrelief TSB's motion requested. Because the district court did have continuing jurisdiction over the trust but the district court's\njudgment exceeded the relief TSB's motion requested, we reinstate only a part of the order and affirm the court of appeals'\njudgment, as modified.\n\n\n\n                                                                 I.\n\nRutilo Vargas Amaro (Vargas) 1 suffered severe injuries in a sugarcane field burn-off. He sued the field's owners, Rio Grande\nValley Sugar Growers, Inc. (Sugar Growers), for negligence in the 206th district court and received a substantial settlement.\nIn 1989, the district court adjudged Vargas incapacitated as defined by section 142.007 of the Texas Property Code, and, on\nVargas's guardian's motion, the court created a trust for him under section 142.005 of the Code. The trust document provided\nthat the trust would terminate when Vargas regained capacity, and the district court's decree stated that the trust would “take\neffect immediately to remain in full force and effect until further orders of this Court.” TSB served as trustee during the trust's\nnine-year existence.\n\nIn May 1997, Vargas filed a “Motion for Termination of Trust” in the 206th district court, alleging that he had regained capacity.\nIn September 1997, before the 206th district court had ruled on Vargas's motion, the 370th District Court of Hidalgo County\nissued an order in Vargas's uncontested divorce action decreeing that Vargas was fully capable of acting as sole managing\nconservator for his minor child and suffered no incapacity. Five days after the 370th district court issued its order, Vargas filed\na motion with the 206th district court to withdraw his request to terminate the trust and, the following day, he filed a notice\nof nonsuit in the 206th district court. Vargas then sent a letter to TSB, demanding that TSB release the trust funds due to the\ndivorce court's adjudication of his regained capacity. In the letter, Vargas threatened TSB with legal action if TSB did not\npromptly comply with the request.\n\nTSB responded by tendering the trust funds to the 206th district court and filing a “Motion Regarding the Rutilo Vargas Amaro\nTrust for Declaratory Judgment and for Other Relief” under the caption of the original personal-injury suit between Vargas\nand Sugar Growers. In this motion, filed September 18, 1997, TSB asked the court: (1) to determine if the trust was terminated\nbecause of Vargas's regained *541 capacity; (2) to allow TSB to resign as trustee and to appoint a substitute trustee in case\nthe trust was not terminated; (3) to “approve final accountings to be submitted to the Court;” and (4) to order any “other and\nfurther relief, at law or in equity, to which TSB may be justly entitled.” TSB alleged jurisdiction under Chapter 142 of the Texas\nProperty Code, the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, 2 and section 115.001 of the Texas Trust Code. 3\n\nOn October 6, Vargas filed a plea to the jurisdiction arguing that the 206th district court did not have continuing jurisdiction\nover the trust, and that the 370th district court had jurisdiction to determine Vargas's capacity. At the same time, he filed a\n“Notice of Determination of Capacity” with the 206th district court, informing the court that the 370th district court had found\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Vargas argued that the trust had terminated by its own terms when the 370th district court ruled that Vargas was not\nincapacitated.\n\nVargas then filed a new suit against TSB in the 93rd District Court, also in Hidalgo County. This suit alleged that TSB had\ncommitted fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, breach of contract, and\nDTPA violations in administering the trust. Some of TSB's alleged misconduct, according to Vargas, had to do with improper\nand imprudent investment decisions, failing to keep Vargas fully informed of trust decisions, and failing to keep proper records\nregarding the trust. This suit is still pending and discovery is proceeding.\n\nOn November 25, 1997, the 206th district court denied Vargas's plea to the jurisdiction and claimed jurisdiction “to any matter\npertaining to the assets of Mr. Rutilo Vargas as it relates to matters of his Trust.” On February 26, 1998, Vargas filed a\n“Supplemental Notice of Determination of Capacity and Request for Release of Monies Owed to Rutilo Vargas Amaro” and\nscheduled a hearing for March 11, 1998. Through a letter to the court coordinator, sent six days before the hearing date, TSB gave\nnotice that it was also scheduling a hearing on its “Motion Regarding the Rutilo Vargas Amaro Trust for Declaratory Judgment\nand for Other Relief.” Vargas objected to TSB's request to have the 206th district court “make final legal determinations,”\narguing that the notice requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 245 were not met.\n\nThe 206th district court held hearings on both parties' motions and, on March 17, issued an “Order Terminating Trust, Approving\nTrust Administration, Investment Philosophy, Accounting, Actions and Fees, and Discharging Trustee Relating to the Rutilo\nVargas Amaro Trust.” In this order, the court terminated the trust due to Vargas's regained capacity and approved all accountings\nTSB presented, including all distributions TSB made, all fees TSB received, and all fees, costs, and expenses TSB paid. In\naddition, the court approved TSB's investment philosophy and ordered that “[s]ubject to the payment to Vargas ... as directed\nabove, the Court discharges TSB as trustee and releases TSB as trustee from any liability to the Trust or to Vargas.”\n\nVargas appealed, complaining that the 206th district court erred in absolving TSB *542 of liability for its handling of the\ntrust. Vargas argued that the Declaratory Judgments Act could not expand the district court's jurisdiction over the trust to allow\nit to adjudicate Vargas's tort claims against TSB. The court of appeals agreed, and modified the district court's judgment by\nreversing those parts of the district court's order: (1) approving all distributions, fees, costs, and expenses TSB paid, except for\nthe fees, costs, and expenses relating to the trust's termination; (2) approving TSB's investment philosophy; and (3) absolving\nTSB from any liability to Vargas or the Vargas trust. 28 S.W.3d at 796.\n\nTSB filed a petition for review, asking this Court to resolve four issues: 1) Did the 206th district court exercise continuing\njurisdiction over the Chapter 142 trust that it created, and thus have jurisdiction to issue its declaratory judgment in connection\nwith the trust, related issues, and parties? 2) Did the 206th district court have jurisdiction to and properly approve the investment\nphilosophy, distributions, and expenses of the trustee of the Vargas trust, to discharge the trustee from liability, and to issue its\ndeclaratory relief? 3) Did Vargas waive his argument concerning the proper scope of declaratory relief by failing to make the\nargument to the district court? and, 4) Did Vargas waive his arguments by accepting payment under the judgment?\n\nVargas counters by asking this Court to consider cross-points that would preclude reinstatement of those parts of the 206th\ndistrict court's judgment reversed by the court of appeals. Specifically, Vargas urges that the district court erred in rendering\njudgment for TSB when Vargas was not given the required forty-five days notice of trial under Rule 245 of the Texas Rules\nof Civil Procedure, and, alternatively, the district court erred in rendering judgment for TSB even though Vargas was denied\nhis right to a jury trial.\n\n\n\n                                                                 II.\n\n [1] We first consider the district court's jurisdiction over a trust created under Texas Property Code section 142.005.

TSB's motion specifically requested the 206th district court to determine whether\nthe trust was terminated due to Vargas's regained capacity, to allow TSB to resign if the trust was not terminated, and to approve\nTSB's final accounting of the trust.\n\nChapter 142 provides that the trust will continue until terminated or revoked, and allows the court to amend, modify, or revoke\nthe trust at any time before its termination. TEX. PROP.CODE § 142.005(d),(f). The 206th district court's decree creating the\ntrust stated that the trust would “take effect immediately to remain in full force and effect until further orders of this court.” And\nthe trust document itself provides that the “Court shall retain the right at any time before the termination of this trust to amend,\nalter, modify, or revoke this trust.” Taken together, these documents invoke the 206th district court's continuing jurisdiction\nover the trust under Chapter 142. Therefore, the 206th district court had continuing jurisdiction over the Vargas trust until such\ntime that it terminated the trust. Thus, although the 370th district court adjudicated Vargas's capacity in the divorce action,\nthe 206th had jurisdiction to consider whether he regained capacity such that the trust was terminated, and the trust did not\nterminate until the 206th so decreed.\n\n\n\n                                                              *543 III.\n\n [2] Having determined that the 206th district court had continuing jurisdiction to determine issues related to the trust and its\ntermination, we now consider whether the court properly exercised that jurisdiction by ordering the relief that it did. As noted,\nthe district court has continuing jurisdiction to supervise, modify, revoke, and terminate the trust. Further, section 142.005(b)\n(4) provides that the trust terminates when the beneficiary regains capacity and section 142.005(e) provides that upon the\ntrust's termination the principal and undistributed income shall be paid to the beneficiary. In this case, neither capacity nor\nthe district court's order terminating the trust are disputed. The question here is whether the remainder of the district court's\norder—specifically, approval of TSB's accounting, approval of TSB's investment philosophy, and absolving TSB of liability\n—was properly granted.\n\nTo determine the corpus due to the beneficiary, the trustee may provide the terminating court with a final accounting of the\ntrust funds for examination. In its motion to the 206th district court, TSB asked the court to “approve final accountings to be\nsubmitted to the Court.” Property Code section 113.152 provides what an accounting should contain.\n\nA written statement of accounts shall show:\n\n  (1) all trust property that has come to the trustee's knowledge or into the trustee's possession and that has not been previously\n  listed or inventoried as property of the trust;\n\n  (2) a complete account of receipts, disbursements, and other transactions regarding the trust property for the period covered\n  by the account, including their source and nature, with receipts of principal and income shown separately;\n\n  (3) a listing of all property being administered, with an adequate description of each asset;\n\n  (4) the cash balance on hand and the name and location of the depository where the balance is kept; and\n\n  (5) all known liabilities owed by the trust.\n\nTEX. PROP.CODE § 113.152. In the context of a terminating trust, the statutory requirements for an accounting form the\nbasis winding up the trust to ascertain the balance due to the beneficiary. Nowhere does section 113.152 mention investment\nphilosophy or potential tort liability to the beneficiary with regard to an accounting. Thus, these determinations are not\ncomponents of an accounting. Accordingly, although the 206th district court's approving TSB's accounting was appropriate\nunder TSB's motion to the court, the 206th district court's approving TSB's investment philosophy and absolving TSB's tort\nliability, if any, were not. The 206th district court improperly granted relief that TSB did not request. TSB's motion asked the\ndistrict court only to determine whether the trust was terminated, to remove TSB as trustee if the trust was not terminated, and\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In its motion, TSB did not ask the district court to adjudicate TSB's potential tort liability\nas trustee, nor to approve TSB's investment philosophy, and therefore the district court should not have ruled on these issues.\nWe conclude that the court of appeals was correct in reversing those parts of the district court's order.\n\n\n\n                                                                IV.\n\n [3] The court of appeals further modified the district court's order by reversing that part of the order approving all distributions,\nfees, costs, and expenses TSB paid from the Vargas trust except those relating to the trust's termination. But Chapter 142 of\nthe Property Code gives *544 the court of continuing jurisdiction the power to approve the trustee's fees, TEX. PROP.CODE\n§ 142.005(b)(6), and the trust instrument also provided that “[t]he trustee shall receive reasonable compensation ... on\napplication to and approval of the 206th District Court.” And because the distributions, costs, and expenses of a trust would be\n“disbursements” under Property Code section 113.152(2), and therefore properly part of the trustee's accounting, we hold that\nthe court of appeals erred by reversing that part of the district court's order. Accordingly, we reinstate that part.\n\n\n\n                                                                 V.\n\n [4] TSB argues that Vargas waived his objections to the proper scope of the declaratory relief the district court granted by\nfailing to make the argument to the district court. We disagree. The error is that the district court's order exceeded the relief\nTSB's motion requested. Vargas objected at the March hearing to the introduction and consideration of evidence that went\nbeyond TSB's request for relief. And, Vargas's brief to the court of appeals clearly objected to the fact that the district court\nwent far beyond the scope of TSB's motion in its final order. Vargas properly preserved his objections.\n\n\n\n                                                                VI.\n\n [5] [6] Finally, TSB argues that Vargas waived his objection to the district court's judgment by accepting payment of his\ntrust monies under that judgment. This Court, in Carle v. Carle, stated that a “litigant cannot treat a judgment as both right and\nwrong, and if he has voluntarily accepted the benefits of a judgment, he cannot afterward prosecute an appeal therefrom.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1506827\"><a href=\"/opinion/1506827/carle-v-carle/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1004 (1950). There is a narrow exception to this rule that as long as an appellant “accepts only that\nwhich appellee concedes, or is bound to concede, to be due him under the judgment he is not estopped to prosecute an appeal\nwhich involves only his right to a further recovery.” Id.\n\nHere, neither side disputes that capacity was regained and that the trust should have been terminated. And neither party argues\nwith winding up the trust and distributing the corpus. Vargas contested only the district court's ability to rule on TSB's potential\ntort liability to Vargas as trustee. Therefore, Vargas's acceptance of the trust corpus is not inconsistent with his position and\nfalls within the Carle exception.\n\n\n\n                                                                VII.\n\nBecause we reinstate the trial court's judgment approving the accounting, including the approval of distributions, fees, costs, and\nexpenses, we next consider Vargas's alternative grounds for affirming the court of appeals' judgment reversing these rulings.\nVargas argues that judgment cannot be rendered on these issues because he was not given the forty-five days notice of trial\nrequired under Rule 245 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Vargas also argues that the 206th district court erred in rendering\njudgment for TSB because it denied him the right to a jury trial.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

To properly assess Vargas's argument that the ruling violates his due process rights, we must\ndetermine the nature of the trial court's ruling. TSB contends that “[a]pproval of an ‘accounting’ involves more than merely\napproval of *545 the math involved in expenditure and disbursement: approval of an accounting disposes of all claims that\nmight be made in regard to matters relating thereto.” For support, TSB cites only one case—Coble Wall Trust Co., Inc. v. Palmer,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384604\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384604/coble-wall-trust-co-inc-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480–81 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1993, writ denied). In that case, the court of appeals held that a probate court's\njudgment, after a full hearing based on the new administrators' and others' objections, that approved the final accounts and\ndischarged Coble Wall from all liability barred the plaintiff's subsequent suit for negligence and DTPA violations. In that case,\nfull evidentiary hearings were conducted and the court of appeals noted that all of the contentions advanced by the plaintiffs\nregarding the estate plan and fees were heard by the probate court and thus were placed in issue and adjudicated. Thus, the\nguardian's liability had been fully litigated in the probate court. Coble Wall does not hold that a court's approval of an accounting\nnecessarily includes adjudication of the trustee's tort liability; it merely affirms that, in certain circumstances, it may. 4\n\n [8] Contrary to TSB's assertion, the Trust Code does not contemplate that an accounting will settle the trustee's tort liability.\nAs noted, section 113.152 establishes the contents of an accounting and requires the trustee to list trust property, transactions,\nproperty, cash, and all known liabilities owed by the trust. It simply does not reach the trustee's tort liability. This conclusion\nis supported by the Trust Code's structure, which includes Subchapter E “Accounting by Trustee” within Chapter 113, entitled\n“Administration.” In contrast, Chapter 114 concerns “liabilities, rights, and remedies of trustees, beneficiaries, and third\npersons.” Thus, the final accounting “form[s] the basis for a winding up of the trust to ascertain the balance due to the\nbeneficiary.” Supra at 543. As TSB states in its brief, “TSB's requested relief in essence provided for determination of what\namounts should be paid to Vargas by TSB and the closing of the trust and issues relating thereto.” Determining TSB's tort\nliability is not necessary to the closing of the trust or ascertaining the trust balance due the beneficiary, and, as we held above,\nwas not within the scope of TSB's requested relief. Accordingly, because approving the accounting, including the distributions,\ncosts, and expenses, was not an adjudication of TSB's tort liabilities, Vargas was not entitled to a jury or to forty-five days\nnotice of the hearing.\n\n\n\n                                                                 VIII.\n\nIn sum, we conclude that under Property Code section 142.005 and the trust documents, the district court had continuing\njurisdiction to rule on the issues requested by TSB's motion; specifically, the 206th district court had jurisdiction in this case to\nterminate the trust and to approve TSB's final accounting, including all distributions, fees, costs, and expenses of the trust. We\nhold that the 206th district court's order exceeded, in part, the relief TSB requested and should not have encompassed approving\nTSB's investment philosophy, nor ruling on TSB's potential tort liability to Vargas. We modify the court of appeal's judgment\nby reinstating that part of the 206th district court's order approving the distributions, fees, costs, *546 and expenses TSB paid\nfrom the Vargas Trust. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeal's judgment, as modified.\n\n\n\nJustice SCHNEIDER did not participate in the decision.\n\nParallel Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

In September of\n1982 Turner instituted this action against Tober. Turner contended that Tober had violated an agreement not to compete with\nTurner; Turner sought damages for prior breaches of the agreement as well as an injunction precluding future breaches. Tober\nlodged a counterclaim against Turner, seeking damages for Turner's alleged wrongful withholding of commissions earned by\nTober.\n\nOn October 11, 1982, following an evidentiary hearing at which both Tober and Turner participated, the trial court signed an\norder which temporarily enjoined Tober from, inter alia, selling specialty advertising items within all of Travis County and the\ncity limits of San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston. On November 9, 1982 Turner filed a motion requesting that the\ntrial court order Tober to appear and show cause as to why Tober should not be held in contempt. On November 16, 1982 Tober\nfiled a motion captioned “Defendant's Response To Plaintiff's Motion To Show Cause; Defendant's Amended Motion To Set\nAside the Temporary Restraining Order And/Or Alternatively Motion to Provide Adequate Bond.”\n\nOn December 1, 1982 the trial court, following a hearing at which Tober and Turner were represented, signed an order overruling\nTober's motion (apparently treating it as a motion to dissolve the temporary injunction). The trial court also found Tober in\ncontempt of the temporary injunction; the contempt order is not here challenged. Tober made a cash deposit in lieu of an appeal\nbond on December 13, 1982.\n\n [1] [2] [3] [4] We initially note that although Tober purports to appeal from the order granting temporary injunction\nas well as the order overruling his subsequently filed motion, he has not perfected an appeal from the initial order. While an\norder granting a temporary injunction is an appealable interlocutory order, see Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 4662 (Supp.1982),\nthe appeal of such an order must conform to the requirements for accelerated appeals, Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 385 (Supp.1983). In\nall accelerated *834 appeals, the deposit in lieu of appeal bond must be made within thirty days after the order is signed. Id.\n385(d). Such a requirement is a prerequisite to invoking this Court's jurisdiction; since Tober made an untimely cash deposit,\nwe are without jurisdiction to consider an appeal of the order granting a temporary injunction.

Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 4662 (Supp.1982). Therefore, although we lack jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the order\ngranting the temporary injunction, we have jurisdiction to review the trial court's order overruling the motion to dissolve the\ninjunction. Marshall v. Good Times, Inc., supra.\n\n [7] [8] [9] The determination of the question of whether to dissolve a temporary injunction is a matter lying within the\ndiscretion of the trial court; the scope of this Court's review of a trial court order overruling a motion to dissolve a temporary\ninjunction is limited to the narrow question of whether the action of the trial judge, in overruling the motion to dissolve,\nconstituted an abuse of discretion. Marshall v. Good Times, Inc., supra. Tober, as movant, has the burden to show that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion. Id.\n\nAs stated above, Tober was represented at the hearing on the application for temporary injunction. At that hearing Tober\npresented evidence in opposition to the granting of the temporary injunction. Later, at the hearing on the motion to dissolve the\ntemporary injunction, Tober presented no evidence in support of dissolution; his case was based exclusively upon his attorney's\nlegal argument.\n\nAppellant's first four points of error relate to errors allegedly committed by the trial court in originally granting the temporary\ninjunction; each of these matters were brought to the trial court's attention prior to the signing of the temporary injunction order,\nand were obviously rejected by the trial court. These points of error provide that the trial court erred in granting the temporary\ninjunction because: (1) neither the contract of employment nor the restrictive covenant designate the market area of Turner,\n(2) the restrictive covenant is not reasonable either as to limitation of time or limitation of geographical area, (3) under the\nevidence presented Turner had breached the contract of employment prior to any breach upon the part of Tober, and (4) an\ninadequate injunction bond was set by the court.\n\n [10] We hold that the above four points of error are not a proper basis upon which Tober may contend that the trial court\nabused its discretion in overruling the motion to dissolve. They are a proper basis upon which Tober could have contended,\nupon direct appeal of the order granting the temporary injunction, that the trial court abused its discretion in granting such. By\nfailing to perfect an appeal from the grant of the temporary injunction, Tober has now, upon appeal of the motion to dissolve,\nwaived the right to complain of the specified alleged errors; this is particularly true where, as here, none of the alleged errors\nare fundamental (i.e. jurisdictional) in nature, and where, as here, the trial court was made aware of such alleged errors prior\nto signing the temporary injunction.\n\n [11] Additionally, to the extent that appellant complains that the restrictive covenant was unreasonable as to geographic scope,\nwe note that the trial court has limited the scope of the temporary injunction in this regard, and has thereby reformed the\ncovenant. Since this is not an appeal of the grant of the temporary injunction, we will presume that the record as a whole supports\nthe trial court's action in granting the temporary injunction. See State v. Friedmann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774286\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774286/state-v-friedmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Civ.App.1978, writ\nref'd n.r.e.) We will not *835 look to the statement of facts from the hearing on the motion to grant the temporary injunction\nto ascertain if the evidence supports such grant. Id.\n\n [12] [13] Finally, we hold that the trial court has no duty, upon the filing of a motion to dissolve, to reconsider the propriety\nof the granting of a temporary injunction, at least where the motion does not allege fundamental error, and also where the\nmotion is not based upon evidence of changed conditions but is rather based upon evidence which was before the court at the\nprior hearing on the motion to grant the temporary injunction. We will specify both practical and legal reasons for this holding\nbelow; however, assuming it to be sound, the trial court cannot be held to have abused its discretion where, as here, it refused\nto alter its prior decision in the absence of new evidence.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, if a litigant could, by motion to dissolve, force reconsideration of the original grant, without a\nshowing of changed conditions, then there is an incentive for him to do so at least once, or more often, in hope that he will be\nable to wear down the resistance of the original trial judge, or in hope that he will be able to secure a hearing before a different\ntrial judge who may be more sympathetic. Such actions needlessly add to the judicial caseload, both at the trial and appellate\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Recognition of the principle that the trial court has no duty to reconsider the validity of the original grant of temporary\ninjunction upon motion to dissolve enables the trial court to dispose of motions to dissolve solely upon the pleadings when the\nmotion to dissolve, on its face, shows that the litigant offers no new evidence.\n\n [14] There is a legal basis for holding that the trial court has no duty, upon motion to dissolve, to reconsider the original grant\nof temporary injunction. Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 385 (Supp.1983) provides that no motion for new trial shall be filed in appeals from\ninterlocutory orders appealable by law. The purpose of this rule is to avoid duplicity of effort and to give some degree of finality\nto interlocutory orders. If a litigant is permitted, upon motion to dissolve, to again challenge the original temporary injunction\ngrant, without an allegation of changed conditions, then the litigant could accomplish indirectly what he could not directly do\n(make a motion for new trial). Cf. State v. Friedmann, supra. In such a manner, the litigant could thereby render meaningless the\nappellate timetable applicable to accelerated appeals, see Tex.R.Civ.P.Ann. 385(d) (Supp.1983); a litigant, after unsuccessfully\nopposing a temporary injunction, could wait for an indefinite period to perfect an appeal of the grant of the temporary injunction\n(by filing a subsequent motion to dissolve, which raises the points of error which could have, and should have, been raised in\na direct appeal of the order granting temporary injunction).\n\n [15] [16] A motion to dissolve may not be used as a means of evading or expanding the rules applicable to appealing\ninterlocutory orders. A statute authorizing an appeal from an interlocutory order must be given a strict construction since the\nstatute is in derogation of the general rule that only final judgments and orders are appealable. 4 Tex.Jur.3d Appellate Review\n§ 70 (1980). We note that Tober did not file his motion to dissolve until after it was too late to perfect an appeal from the order\ngranting a temporary injunction.\n\n [17] [18] We should not be understood to say that a trial court lacks the authority to reverse its prior temporary injunction order\nabsent a showing of changed conditions; it does have that power.

The Supreme Court stated the rule that appellate courts lack jurisdiction to review an unappealable\ninterlocutory order in an appeal “from another interlocutory order which is appealable except insofar as the questions raised\nmight affect the validity of the latter order.” 343 S.W.2d at 243. We hold that the questions relevant to the grant of the temporary\ninjunction, raised by Tober in this appeal, do not affect the validity of the order overruling the motion to dissolve; however,\nour holding does not here turn solely upon jurisdiction, but is also grounded upon Tober's failure to prove that the trial court\nabused its discretion in overruling the motion to dissolve.\n\nWe should stress that most of what we have said above, especially as it relates to the trial court's duty in considering a motion\nto dissolve, is applicable to temporary injunctions, which are granted only after notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary\nhearing; the trial court's duty in considering a motion to dissolve an injunctive order rendered without notice and opportunity for\nhearing would be broader. Compare State v. Friedmann, supra (motion to dissolve filed after full evidentiary hearing on grant\nof temporary injunction) with Whitaker v.

(temporary injunction\ngranted solely upon intervenor's sworn petition).\n\nMuch of the confusion as to the proper scope of a motion to dissolve arises from cases decided at a time when no distinction\nwas made as between injunctive relief granted before and injunctive relief granted after a full evidentiary hearing. Apparently,\nunder prior law it was standard procedure for a trial court to issue a temporary injunction solely upon the applicant's sworn\npetition; therefore, upon filing a motion to dismiss, the opposite party had a right to a full evidentiary hearing upon the issue\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The purpose of the motion to dissolve is to provide a means to\nshow that changed circumstances or changes in the law require the modification or dissolution of the injunction; the purpose\nis not to give an unsuccessful party an opportunity to relitigate the propriety of the original grant. Id.; see State v. Friedmann,\nsupra. Tober's first four points of error are overruled.\n\nIn his fifth point of error Tober contends that the trial court erred in granting a temporary injunction which by its terms restrained\npersons who were not parties to this action. Although this point attacks the original grant of temporary injunction, apparently\nit could not have been brought to the trial court's attention prior to entry of the judgment. However, it could have been raised\nin a direct appeal from the order granting temporary injunction. For that reason, it is questionable, under the above analysis,\nas to whether it can now be raised in the appeal of the order overruling the motion to dissolve. However, we need *837 not\nresolve that question, since it is obvious from reading the temporary injunction order that Tober, and no other person, is thereby\nenjoined. The fifth point of error is overruled.\n\nFinally, Tober complains that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to hear evidence of Turner's breach of the\nemployment contract. Tober contends that such evidence was relevant to showing that Turner lacked clean hands and that\nTurner was therefore not entitled to equitable relief.\n\n [22] To the extent that Tober complains of the trial court's refusal to hear evidence at the hearing on application for temporary\ninjunction, we hold, for reasons given above, that such is not within the proper scope of a motion to dissolve. The same holds\ntrue as to any complaint of the trial court's refusal, at the hearing on the motion to dissolve, to consider evidence not relevant\nto changed conditions, unless, perhaps, there is an allegation that such evidence is newly discovered.\n\n [23] Also, we have examined the statement of facts from the hearing on the motion to dissolve. At no point did Tober offer\nany evidence; the trial court certainly never prevented the introduction of any evidence. Even if the trial court had refused to\nhear testimony, Tober does not direct us to a bill of exceptions which would show what the witnesses would have testified\nto; therefore, no error is shown.

BROWN, Justice.\n\nThis case arises out of a home-equity loan obtained by appellants Alice M. Wood and Daniel L. Wood in 2004 that encumbered\ntheir homestead with a lien. The Woods appeal the summary judgment granted in favor of appellees HSBC Bank USA, N.A.\nand Ocwen Loan Servicing, L.L.C. The Woods presented a single issue on appeal, which we address in two separate sub-issues:\n\n  (1) Whether the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.051 four-year statute of limitations bars the Woods'\n     claims for monetary and declaratory relief based on HSBC's and Ocwen's alleged violations of the home-equity lending\n     protections found in article XVI, section 50(a)(6), of the Texas Constitution.\n\n  (2) Whether the section 16.051 statute of limitations bars the Woods' claim for monetary relief based on HSBC's and Ocwen's\n     alleged breach of the security instrument creating the home-equity lien.\n\nBecause we conclude that the Woods' claims are barred by limitations, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nOn July 2, 2004, the Woods obtained a home-equity loan of $76,000 from Fremont Investment & Loan, secured by a first\nlien on their homestead located in Fresno, Fort Bend County, Texas. On March 16, 2012, the Woods sent HSBC, the current\nholder of the lien, a “Notice of Request to Cure.” The Notice alleged that the home-equity lien violated seven provisions of\narticle XVI, section 50(a)(6), of the Texas Constitution and demanded that HSBC cure the alleged violations. HSBC did not\nrespond to the Woods' letter.\n\nOn July 9, 2012, the Woods sued HSBC, Ocwen, Ameriapraise, Inc., and Joel Brock seeking forfeiture of principal and interest\nfor the constitutional violations, damages for breach of contract, damages for fraud, and a declaratory judgment that (1) the\nloan and accompanying home-equity lien were void, (2) HSBC failed to cure the constitutional defects, and (3) HSBC must\nforfeit all principal and interest paid on the loan. HSBC and Ocwen answered on August 10, 2012. HSBC filed a counterclaim\non February 28, 2013, seeking a declaration that it was equitably subrogated to the rights of the prior lienholders.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

On February 7, 2013, HSBC and Ocwen filed a hybrid traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment.\nIn their motion, HSBC and Ocwen asserted that all of the Woods' claims were barred by limitations, that no tolling rule delayed\nthe accrual of the Woods' claims, that the constitutional claims failed as a matter of law, that the Woods' breach of contract\nclaim failed as a matter of law, and that no evidence supported the Woods' fraud claim. 1 On April 4, 2013, the trial court\ngranted HSBC's traditional and no- *589 evidence motions and denied the Woods' motion for summary judgment. The Woods\nthen nonsuited defendants Ameriapraise, Inc. and Joel Brock, and HSBC nonsuited its counterclaim for equitable subrogation\nagainst the Woods. The Woods timely appealed.\n\n\n\n                                 II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n [1] [2] We review the trial court's granting of summary judgment de novo.

DISCUSSION\n\nA. The Woods' claims for monetary and declaratory relief under Texas Constitution article XVI, section 50(a)(6), are\nbarred by the section 16.051 four-year statute of limitations.\nThe Woods alleged in their petition that the home-equity lien on their residence violated article XVI, sections 50(a)(6)(B), 50(a)\n(6)(E), 50(a)(6)(Q)(v), and 50(a)(6)(Q)(viii), of the Texas Constitution. The Woods contend that their home-equity lien is void\nbecause of section 50(c), which states, “No mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the homestead shall ever be valid unless it\nsecures a debt described by this section ....” Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 50(c). The Woods assert that section 50(c) renders “void\nbut curable” any home-equity lien that does not strictly comply with a provision of section 50(a)(6). Consequently, because an\naction to remove a cloud on *590 title is not subject to the four-year residual statute of limitations if a lien is void, see Ford\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

They further assert that section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x) allows a lender to cure a lien that would otherwise be invalid.\nHSBC argues that the trial court properly granted summary judgment on limitations grounds because a voidable lien is subject\nto limitations and the Woods did not file suit until eight years after closing the transaction.\n\n\n1. Home-equity liens that do not comply with section 50(a)(6) are voidable.\nThe fundamental question we face today is whether a home-equity lien that violates section 50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution\nis void or voidable. Two courts have recently concluded that constitutionally noncompliant homestead liens are voidable. First,\nlike the Woods, the plaintiffs in Priester obtained a home-equity loan that did not comply with the constitutional requirements.\n708 F.3d at 671. Five years after the transaction closed, the plaintiffs sent a letter to the defendant, which had acquired the loan\nfrom the original lender, requesting cure under section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x). Id. The defendant took no action to cure the perceived\ninfirmities. Id. The plaintiffs then sued the defendants for a declaratory judgment that the loan and lien on their home were void\nab initio, that the defendants had failed to cure, and that the defendants were required to forfeit all principal and interest. Id. In\ndeciding whether a statute of limitations applied to the plaintiffs' claims, the Priester court reasoned:\n\n  The decision in Doody v. Ameriquest Mortgage Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1463910\"><a href=\"/opinion/1463910/doody-v-ameriquest-mort-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.2001), offers indirect support for the applicability\n  of limitations. The court responded to a question certified by this court on the issue of cure, explaining that a lien cured under\n  Section 50(a)(6)(Q) became valid even if it was “invalid” before the cure. Id. at 347. Discussing forfeiture, the court stated\n  that “if a lien that secures such a loan is voided,” the lender loses all rights to recovery. Id. at 346. That language suggests that\n  the Texas Supreme Court considers liens created in violation of Section 50(a)(6) to be voidable rather than void—a “void”\n  lien could not be “voided” by future action.\n\n708 F.3d at 674. The Priester court further noted that “[b]ecause a cure provision exists in Section 50(a)(6)(Q), liens that are\ncontrary to the requirements of § 50(a) are voidable rather than void from the start.” Id. at 674 n. 4. 2\n\n *591 Second, after the Priester decision was issued, the Dallas Court of Appeals faced a similar question in Williams. In\nthat case, the plaintiff's husband took out a loan on the couple's residence and represented himself to be an unmarried man.\nWilliams, 407 S.W.3d at 392. Six years after she discovered the home-equity loan and lien, the plaintiff sought declaratory\njudgment that the home-equity lien was void. Id. at 392–93, 398. The trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary\njudgment, which was based in part on the applicability of the four-year residual statute of limitations found in section 16.051\nof the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Id. at 393. The plaintiff argued on appeal that the home-equity lien on her\nhomestead was void because she did not sign the agreement granting the lien or consent to it. Id. at 395; see Tex. Const. art.\nXVI, § 50(a)(6)(A). Finding the Priester court's analysis persuasive, the Williams court held that the noncompliant home-equity\nlien was voidable. Id. at 397.\n\nWe too find the Priester court's analysis persuasive not only because of its sound reasoning, but also because its conclusion\ncomports with Texas Supreme Court precedent on the key distinction between a void act and a voidable act, which is a party's\nability—either through its own action or through the judicial process—to disaffirm, ratify, or confirm a voidable act.

While this may have been the\ncase prior to the 1997 constitutional amendment that added the section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x) cure provisions, it is not the case now.\nThe 1997 home-equity loan amendment affords lenders the means to correct mistakes in order to validate a noncompliant home-\nequity lien.

We\n            construe constitutional provisions and amendments that relate to the same subject matter together and\n            consider those amendments and provisions in light of each other. And we strive to avoid a construction\n            that renders any provision meaningless or inoperative.\n\nDoody, 49 S.W.3d at 344 (citations omitted). In adhering to these core principles, the Doody court stated:\n\n            [T]he cure provision in section 50(a)(6)(Q)(x) applies to all the lender's obligations under the ‘extension\n            of credit’ including section 50(c)'s requirements that to be valid a homestead must secure a debt described\n            by this section.\n\nId. at 345. Accepting the Woods' position would require us to read section 50(c) in isolation and in contravention of Texas\nSupreme Court precedent, which we decline to do.\n\n[3] Accordingly, we hold that because a cure provision exists in the Texas Constitution, homestead liens that do not comply\nwith the constitutional requirements are voidable. Priester, 708 F.3d at 674; Williams, 407 S.W.3d at 396–97.\n\n\n2. The four-year statute of limitations of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.051 applies to the Woods'\nconstitutional claims.\n [4] Having determined that noncompliant home-equity liens are voidable, and because such liens are subject to limitations,\nwe must decide which statute of limitations applies to the Woods' constitutional claims. “Every action for which there is no\nexpress limitations period, except an action for the recovery of real property, must be brought not later than four years after the\nday the cause of action accrues.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 16.051 (West 2008). Section 50(a)(6) does not contain an\nexpress limitations period. Williams, 407 S.W.3d at 394. Therefore, the Woods' causes of action based on HSBC and Ocwen's\nalleged violations of section 50(a)(6) are subject to the section 16.051 four-year residual statute of limitations.\n\n [5] [6] [7] Anticipating the possibility that section 16.051 would apply to their constitutional claims, the Woods assert that\nsection 16.051 does not apply to their declaratory judgment action to cancel HSBC's lien because it constitutes an action for\nthe recovery of real property. An action for the recovery of real property is one that would support a trespass to try title suit\nwithout first invoking the equitable powers *593 of the court to cancel a deed. Miles v.

In MacDonald, the plaintiff brought an action in trespass to try title seeking to impose a\nconstructive trust on the legal title to real property acquired by the defendant through an alleged breach of fiduciary duty. 180\nS.W.2d at 335–36. The Texas Supreme Court held that if the plaintiff could successfully establish a relationship of trust and\nconfidence with the defendant, then the four-year statute of limitations would not apply to the plaintiff's suit because it would\nbe an action to recover real property. Id. at 338. In Lemons, the plaintiff sued to impose a constructive trust on the legal title to\nreal property purchased by the defendant with funds that were removed from the plaintiff's bank account without authority. 281\nS.W.3d at 645. The defendant moved to transfer venue under section 15.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Id.\nat 646. Section 15.011 is a mandatory venue provision stating that “[a]ctions for recovery of real property ... shall be brought in\nthe county in which all or a part of the property is located.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 15.011 (West 2002); Lemons,\n281 S.W.3d at 646.

(mem.\nop.). Here, the Woods are challenging the validity of the home-equity lien on constitutional grounds. Therefore, the Woods'\nconstitutional claims accrued on July 2, 2004, the date the Woods' home-equity loan closed.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, we reject the Woods' alternative arguments for a later accrual date. The Woods initially rely on\nDessommes v. Dessommes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2430669\"><a href=\"/opinion/2430669/dessommes-v-dessommes/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.), in support of their position *595\nthat no controversy arose with respect to their declaratory judgment action until HSBC failed to cure. Essentially, the Woods\nargue that, for purposes of determining the accrual date, their legal injury did not occur until the sixty-day period for cure\nexpired. See Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 50(a)(6)(Q)(x). However, Dessommes simply restates the general principle that a statute\nof limitations begins to run when facts come into existence authorizing a party to seek a judicial remedy, i.e., when the legal\ninjury occurs. 543 S.W.2d at 169 (citing Williams v.

The facts that\nwould have alerted the Woods to potential constitutional violations—e.g., fees exceeding three percent of the loan amount—\nexisted when the transaction closed, as did their right to seek a judicial remedy for those violations. Furthermore, nothing in\nthe Texas Constitution prevented the Woods from initiating their declaratory judgment action as soon as the transaction closed.\nSee Priester, 708 F.3d at 675 n. 6 (“[T]here is nothing in the Texas Constitution that suggests that the borrower must seek\ncure before filing suit.”).\n\n [11] The Woods next argue that the statute of limitations was tolled because of HSBC's “continuing and ongoing violations”\nof the Texas Constitution. The Woods did not explain or cite any legal authority in support of their contention. This issue is\ntherefore inadequately briefed. See Tex.R.App. P. 38.1(i); In re S.A.H., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 929 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]\n2014, no pet.). Because we conclude that the Woods have waived error on this particular argument, we decline to address it. 4\n\nIn sum, because a cure provision exists in the Texas Constitution, homestead liens that do not comply with the constitutional\nrequirements are voidable. The section 16.051 four-year residual statute of limitations applies to the Woods' constitutional\nclaims, and their constitutional claims are not actions for the recovery of real property. The Woods' constitutional claims accrued\nwhen the home-equity transaction closed on July 2, 2004. The Woods had until July 2, 2008, to file their petition. The Woods\ndid not file their original petition until July 9, 2012.\n\nWith regard to the Woods' constitutional claims, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting HSBC's motion for\nsummary judgment on limitations grounds.

The Woods referred to certain\nitemized charges in the HUD–1 settlement statement as evidence that HSBC assessed excessive fees. 8 The HUD–1 identified\nthe settlement date as July 2, 2004, which coincides with the closing date of the transaction.

Collier stands for the proposition that an invalid lien cannot be ratified unless the authority to ratify it exists\n      under our Constitution or statutes. Collier v.

Doody, 49 S.W.3d at 346. The Doody court's statement supports our conclusion that constitutionally noncompliant\n      liens are voidable.\n         The Woods' further reliance on York v.

The York court held that a judgment that violates a bankruptcy automatic stay is void unless a federal bankruptcy court\n         modifies the stay. Id. at 40. The Woods' situation is distinguishable because the lender in a home-equity transaction has the ability\n         under our Constitution to cure the noncompliant lien without the involvement of the federal judiciary or any other third party.\n         Furthermore, the Texas Supreme Court has noted that the rationale for classifying judgments in violation of an automatic stay\n         as void was that bankruptcy law vests “exclusive jurisdiction” in the bankruptcy courts.

That rationale does\n         not apply to the present case.\n4     The Woods pleaded two alternative tolling theories in their second amended petition—the discovery rule and equitable tolling. Both\n      theories were addressed in HSBC and Ocwen's motion for summary judgment and in the Woods' response to HSBC and Ocwen's\n      motion for summary judgment. The Woods did not raise these theories on appeal and have therefore abandoned them. See Tex.R.App.\n      P. 38.1(f), 47.1; Shafaii Children's Trust, 417 S.W.3d at 622 n. 6; Martinez, 218 S.W.3d at 844 (“When reviewing a civil matter,\n      an appellate court has no discretion to consider an issue not raised in the appellant's brief, even if the ends of justice so require.”);\n      see also Clonts, 294 S.W. at 846.\n5     In an additional argument against the applicability of a statute of limitations to their constitutional claims, the Woods characterize\n      their declaratory judgment action as a defense to foreclosure. According to the Woods, because defenses are not governed by the\n      statutes of limitations, their declaratory judgment action is not barred by limitations. We have indicated in the foreclosure context\n      that a lender's failure to comply with the constitutional requirements is in the nature of an affirmative defense. Wilson v.

Unless the law or these rules provide otherwise, a judgment debtor may supersede the judgment by:\n\n\n  (1) filing with the trial court clerk a written agreement with the judgment creditor for suspending enforcement of the judgment;\n\n\n  (2) filing with the trial court clerk a good and sufficient bond;\n\n\n  (3) making a deposit with the trial court clerk in lieu of a bond; or\n\n\n  (4) providing alternate security ordered by the court.\n\n\n(b) Bonds.\n\n\n  (1) A bond must be:\n\n\n     (A) in the amount required by 24.2;\n\n\n     (B) payable to the judgment creditor;\n\n\n     (C) signed by the judgment debtor or the debtor's agent;\n\n\n     (D) signed by a sufficient surety or sureties as obligors; and\n\n\n     (E) conditioned as required by (d).\n\n\n  (2) To be effective a bond must be approved by the trial court clerk.

Instead of filing a surety bond, a party may deposit with the trial court clerk:\n\n\n     (A) cash;\n\n\n     (B) a cashier's check payable to the clerk, drawn on any federally insured and federally or state-chartered bank or savings-\n     and-loan association; or\n\n\n     (C) with leave of court, a negotiable obligation of the federal government or of any federally insured and federally or state-\n     chartered bank or savings-and-loan association.\n\n\n  (2) Amount of Deposit. The deposit must be in the amount required by 24.2.\n\n\n  (3) Clerk's Duties; Interest. The clerk must promptly deposit any cash or a cashier's check in accordance with law. The clerk\n  must hold the deposit until the conditions of liability in (d) are extinguished. The clerk must then release any remaining funds\n  in the deposit to the judgment debtor.\n\n\n(d) Conditions of Liability. The surety or sureties on a bond, any deposit in lieu of a bond, or any alternate security ordered\nby the court is subject to liability for all damages and costs that may be awarded against the debtor--up to the amount of the\nbond, deposit, or security--if:\n\n\n  (1) the debtor does not perfect an appeal or the debtor's appeal is dismissed, and the debtor does not perform the trial court's\n  judgment;\n\n\n  (2) the debtor does not perform an adverse judgment final on appeal; or\n\n\n  (3) the judgment is for the recovery of an interest in real or personal property, and the debtor does not pay the creditor the\n  value of the property interest's rent or revenue during the pendency of the appeal.\n\n\n(e) Orders of Trial Court. The trial court may make any order necessary to adequately protect the judgment creditor against\nloss or damage that the appeal might cause.\n\n\n(f) Effect of Supersedeas. Enforcement of a judgment must be suspended if the judgment is superseded. Enforcement begun\nbefore the judgment is superseded must cease when the judgment is superseded. If execution has been issued, the clerk will\npromptly issue a writ of supersedeas.\n\n\nCredits\nEff. Sept. 1, 1997.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.
