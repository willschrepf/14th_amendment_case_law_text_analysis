Tanesha Davis sued Cintas Corporation, individually\nand on behalf of a class of female job applicants denied employment as entry-level sales\nrepresentatives. She alleged that Cintas’s hiring practices led to gender discrimination,\nin violation of Title VII, and caused Cintas to reject her application for employment\ntwice. The district court denied Davis’s motion for class certification, and ultimately\ngranted summary judgment for Cintas on her individual claims. Davis appeals. We\naffirm the district court’s denial of class certification. We also affirm its grant of\nsummary judgment on her individual disparate-treatment claim arising in 2004 and her\ndisparate-impact claim. However, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment for Cintas on Davis’s disparate-treatment claim arising in 2003, and remand\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            I\n\n       According to Cintas’s promotional materials, service sales representatives are\n“[t]he #1 link between our customers and our company operations. The Service Sales\nRepresentative is Cintas.” More specifically, the position involves delivering and selling\nCintas’s wares—“corporate identity uniforms and value-added products”—and\nproviding direct customer service.\n\n       Although Cintas is a large corporation with many locations nationwide, its\ncorporate policy is “to run one business in many different cities instead of running\nmany different businesses in different cities.” “[A]ll Cintas operations use the same\nterminology, use the same forms and paperwork, and ‘run their stores’ the same way.”\nHiring for the service-sales-representative position is no exception. All Cintas locations\nuse—and used at all times relevant to this claim—the “Meticulous Hiring System.” This\npolicy provides: “No person will be hired in the company until [Cintas has] identified\nthe traits and competencies needed to be successful in the position. The traits and\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                           Page 3\n\n\ncompetencies must be documented in a list of ‘must have’ and ‘preferred’ hiring\nstandards for each position.”\n\n       For the service-sales-representative position, “Must Haves” include both\nobjective and subjective elements. Objectively, applicants must achieve a minimum\nscore on a standardized test given to all service-sales-representative applicants, have a\ndriver’s license and a GED or high-school diploma, and be able to lift forty pounds.\nSubjectively, applicants must demonstrate customer orientation, sales orientation,\nintegrity, dependability, achievement orientation, flexibility, stress tolerance, openness\nto differences, tenacity, initiative, persuasiveness, professionalism, compensation\ncompatibility, and a stable employment history. There are also both objective and\nsubjective “Preferreds.” Objectively, Cintas would like candidates to achieve a score\nbetween twenty-one and twenty-seven on the Wonderlic-WPT test (a type of intelligence\ntest); subjectively, it seeks candidates who have successful sales experience, successful\ncustomer-service experience, and the ability to work without supervision.\n\n       Cintas uses a sixteen-step process to determine whether candidates meet these\ncriteria. After Cintas decides that a location needs a service sales representative and\nposts the job, managers screen applications and resumes. Next, managers conduct\nscreening interviews, using a guide that contains pre-scripted questions, and invite\nqualified applicants to visit a Cintas location and take pre-employment tests. Managers\nthen collect the applicant’s application materials, and administer the Wonderlic-WPT\ntest and the “ePredix SSR Test.”        If an applicant scores well enough on these\nexaminations, she receives a “1st In-depth Interview using [Cintas’s service-sales-\nrepresentative] 1st In-depth Interview Guide.” After this first interview, qualified\napplicants go on a “route ride,” and Cintas “[c]ollect[s] paperwork,” including tax forms\nand driving records. If the applicant completes her “route ride” successfully, she\nreceives a “2nd In-depth Interview using [Cintas’s service-sales-representative] 2nd In-\ndepth Interview Guide.” The applicant’s last step is a final interview, often with a\nLocation’s general manager. Management then confers with everyone involved in the\ninterview process, performs a criminal background check, a drug screening, a driving-\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 4\n\n\nrecord and credit-record check, contacts the applicant’s references, and finally\ndetermines whether to offer the candidate a job.\n\n       Although this process has well-defined steps, set as a matter of corporate policy,\nindividual managers at different locations ultimately make the hiring decisions, based\non local needs. Cintas’s national hiring profile states that “[a]dditional Preferreds can\nbe added to accommodate the needs of the Division, Group, or Location.” Some\nlocations, for instance, emphasized sales experience over customer-service experience\nbecause of intense market competition, while others preferred the inverse because\ndifficult economic conditions made keeping existing customers crucial.\n\n       Service sales representatives were historically male. From June 1999 to October\n2006, more than ninety percent of the managers charged with hiring service sales\nrepresentatives were male. This overwhelmingly male group overwhelmingly hired\nmales. After Cintas implemented the Meticulous Hiring System in 2003, however,\nfemale hiring rose dramatically. Between 1999 and 2002, the percentage of women hired\nfor the service-sales-representative position never rose above seven percent. In 2003,\nthe year corporate-level management instructed other managers to “put the myth that\nfemales cannot be SSRs out of [their] mind and hire more women SSRs,” and\nimplemented the Meticulous Hiring System, that number rose to 7.8 percent. In 2004,\nit rose to 10.9 percent, and in 2005 it rose to 20.8 percent.\n\n        Anecdotal accounts support the data suggesting that Cintas managers saw the\nservice-sales-representative position as a man’s position. According to a former\nmanager, who was male, other managers at one Cintas location opined that women could\nnot handle the responsibilities of a service sales representative. Sharon Punch-Johnson,\na female applicant who was ultimately rejected, averred that a manager asked whether\nher husband would be comfortable with his wife working predominantly with males. In\nher deposition, Kristi Clement Williams, another female applicant, claimed that a Cintas\nmanager suggested that females might not be comfortable in the service-sales-\nrepresentative position because the job required going into men’s locker rooms, and\ndepended on interactions with customers in “a predominantly male environment.” Still\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                           Page 5\n\n\nanother female applicant claimed in a declaration that a Cintas manager bluntly told her:\n“Cintas preferred to hire men in [the service-sales-representative] position[].”\n\n       Tanesha Davis, then a store manager for LensCrafters, first applied for a service-\nsales-representative position at Cintas’s Franklin, Wisconsin location, Location 447, in\n2003. Human-Resources Manager Christine Richards conducted a screening interview\nand took notes.     Although she does not now recall the interview, Richards’s\ncontemporaneous notes suggest that she rejected Davis at the screening stage because\nDavis said that she disliked having to sell products that she considered overpriced, and\nthat she wanted to continue working another job part-time. Richards, of course, is\nadamant that she did not reject Davis because of her race or gender. Rather, Richards\nclaims, Davis was simply not the best-qualified applicant for Location 447’s available\nservice-sales-representative position. Approximately three months before Davis applied,\nLocation 447 had hired another female service sales representative. It hired one male\nservice sales representative just before Davis applied, and another two while her\napplication was pending.\n\n       Davis applied again one year later. This time, she advanced further into the\nhiring process. She passed her initial screening interview, even though she expressed\nconcerns about working in bad weather, and achieved the second highest score recorded\nduring 2003 and 2004 on one of Cintas’s standardized tests. Matt Presendofer, the\nmanager who observed Davis’s route ride, reported that “she did a lot of things well out\non the route.” Presendofer even opined that, “from a customer standpoint . . . and from\na sales standpoint[] [s]he had all the . . . attributes we wanted for a SSR candidate.” He\nexpressed concerns, however, about her level of physical energy and her efficiency. As\nin 2003, Cintas ultimately chose not to hire Davis. Eight days after Davis’s route ride\nin 2004, Location 447 hired another woman. While her 2004 application was pending\nCintas hired three male service sales representatives, and hired a fourth man within two\nmonths after rejecting Davis’s application.\n\n       This lawsuit, though, did not start with Davis. It began instead in January 2004\nin the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, where a group\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                            Page 6\n\n\nof Cintas employees, which did not include Davis, filed a civil-rights class-action lawsuit\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The plaintiffs\namended their complaint five months later, adding a Title VII claim, a claim under the\nCalifornia Fair Employment and Housing Act, and two additional plaintiffs. The parties\nthen agreed to transfer the California action to the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Michigan, where another hiring-discrimination case was pending\nagainst Cintas, and to consolidate the two cases for pretrial proceedings.\n\n       Cintas next moved (1) for summary judgment on the individual claims of one of\nthe California plaintiffs, and (2) to limit the Michigan case’s purportedly nationwide\nclass to the State of Michigan. Counsel in the California case sought leave to add Davis\nand another woman, Cindy Patterson, as named plaintiffs.\n\n       While these motions were pending, plaintiffs in both cases made a joint motion\nto certify a class, consisting of “all females who unsuccessfully applied for the SSR job\nat any time on or after June 12, 1999.” They requested certification for claims involving\ndeclaratory and equitable relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and\ncertification for their classwide punitive-damages claim under Rule 23(b)(3). Before\nresolving the class-certification motion, the district court granted leave to add Davis and\nPatterson as plaintiffs, granted summary judgment for Cintas on the California plaintiff’s\nclaim, and limited the Michigan claims to Michigan.\n\n       Ultimately, the district court denied class certification. Serrano v. Cintas Corp.,\nNos. 04-40132, 06-12311, 2009 WL 910702, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2009). It\nreasoned that the putative class did not satisfy Rules 23(a)(2), 23(a)(3), 23(a)(4),\n23(b)(2), or 23(b)(3), because the case involved a “hiring process . . . conducted by\nthousands of Cintas managers at hundreds of Cintas facilities,” id. at *5, there was a\n“conflict between the interests of the named and unnamed class members,” id. at *9, and\n“the damages sought by Plaintiffs would require individualized determinations\ninappropriate for a [Rule 23(b)(2)] class action.” Id. at *10. The court denied a Rule\n23(f) petition for interlocutory appeal. All remaining plaintiffs, except for Davis,\ndismissed their individual claims and all class claims, except for the gender-\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                             Page 7\n\n\ndiscrimination claim before us.        Davis maintained her individual employment-\ndiscrimination claim.     Cintas, however, moved for—and was granted—summary\njudgment on that issue. Davis appeals, individually and on behalf of the gender-\ndiscrimination class.\n\n                                             II\n\n                                             A\n\n        Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 allows a plaintiff to pursue claims on behalf\nof a class of similarly situated individuals if she demonstrates that she is “part of the\nclass and ‘possess[es] the same interest and suffer[s] the same injury’ as the class\nmembers.” East Tex. Motor Freight Sys., Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 (1977).\nTo justify this “exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf\nof the individual named parties only,” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700–01\n(1979), the plaintiff must meet a series of conditions laid out in Rule 23 to ensure, first,\nthat she is an appropriate representative for absent class members, and, second, that her\nclaim is appropriate for classwide resolution. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.\n\n        Class-certification litigation is the process of determining whether a plaintiff can\nmeet these conditions. The analysis proceeds in two steps. Rule 23(a) is “the starting\ngate.” Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2562 (2011) (Ginsburg, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). It establishes four requirements:\n\n        (1) the class [must be] so numerous that joinder of all members is\n        impracticable;\n        (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;\n        (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the\n        claims or defenses of the class; and\n        (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\n        interests of the class.\n\fNo. 10-1662           Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                     Page 8\n\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)–(4).1 If the plaintiff does not satisfy each of these requirements,\nher class claim fails at the threshold. If, however, the plaintiff shows that she is an\nappropriate representative within the meaning of Rule 23(a), the focus shifts to the case\nitself.\n\n          Under Rule 23(b), four types of lawsuits may proceed as class actions.\nSpecifically, class resolution is appropriate when:\n\n          (1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members\n          would create a risk of:\n                   (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to\n                   individual class members that would establish\n                   incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing\n                   the class; or\n                   (B) adjudications with respect to individual class\n                   members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive\n                   of the interests of the other members not parties to the\n                   individual adjudications or would substantially impair or\n                   impede their ability to protect their interests;\n          (2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\n          that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\n          corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\n          whole; or\n          (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class\n          members predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n          members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods\n          for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)–(3). If the plaintiff’s claim does not fall into one of these\ncategories, class certification is inappropriate, even if the plaintiff meets each of Rule\n23(a)’s four threshold requirements.\n\n          In sum, then, a plaintiff must show that she meets all four Rule 23(a) criteria, and\nthat her case falls into at least one of the four Rule 23(b) categories. If she fails to satisfy\nany of these requirements, class certification is not appropriate.\n\n\n          1\n          Some courts also impose two “implicit requirements,” definiteness and membership in the class,\nin addition to Rules 23(a)(1)–(4). See 5 HERBERT B. NEWBERG & ALBA CONTE, NEWBERG ON CLASS\nACTIONS § 3:1 (2011). These supplemental—perhaps superfluous—prerequisites, however, are not at issue\nhere.\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                             Page 9\n\n\n        The district court must conduct “a rigorous analysis,” Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw.\nv. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982), at “an early practicable time . . . [to] determine by\norder whether to certify the action as a class action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A).\n“Frequently that ‘rigorous analysis’ will entail some overlap with the merits of the\nplaintiff’s underlying claim. That cannot be helped.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. Thus,\nin the class-certification context, courts are permitted to “probe behind the pleadings,”\nFalcon, 457 U.S. at 160, and “touch[] aspects of the merits.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2552.\n\n        Because “[a] district court’s class-certification decision calls for an exercise of\njudgment,” our review is narrow. Pilgrim v. Universal Health Card, LLC, 660 F.3d 943,\n946 (6th Cir. 2011). We reverse only if the district court abused its discretion or applied\nan erroneous legal standard. Ibid.\n\n                                            B\n\n        “Title VII . . . contains no special authorization for class suits maintained by\nprivate parties. [Therefore,] [a]n individual litigant seeking to maintain a class action\nunder Title VII must meet the prerequisites of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and\nadequacy of representation specified in Rule 23(a).” Falcon, 457 U.S. at 156. In 2011,\nthe Supreme Court addressed this particular type of class certification in Dukes.\nAccordingly, our first task is to determine precisely what impact that case has on Davis’s\nbid for class certification.\n\n        Dukes, like this case, involved allegations of gender discrimination. The\nplaintiffs alleged that Wal–Mart systematically discriminated against women in pay and\npromotion decisions. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2547. Those “decisions at Wal–Mart [were]\ngenerally committed to local managers’ broad discretion,” although, particularly for\npromotion decisions, some objective requirements did apply. Ibid.\n\n        The plaintiffs brought a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 1.5 million women,\nunder Title VII.

The basic theory of their case [was] that\n       a strong and uniform “corporate culture” permit[ted] bias against women\n       to infect, perhaps subconsciously, the discretionary decisionmaking of\n       each one of Wal–Mart’s thousands of managers—thereby making every\n       woman at the company the victim of one common discriminatory\n       practice. [The plaintiffs] therefore wish[ed] to litigate the Title VII\n       claims of all female employees at Wal–Mart’s stores in a nationwide\n       class action.\n\nId. at 2548. They sought “injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages, and\nbackpay,” but not compensatory damages. Ibid.\n\n       For a 5–4 majority, Justice Scalia held that the case could not proceed as a class\naction because the plaintiffs could not establish commonality, within the meaning of\nRule 23(a)(2). He began by noting that, to have suffered a violation of the same\nprovision of law—Title VII, for instance—is not necessarily to have suffered the same\ninjury. To satisfy commonality, Justice Scalia reasoned, a putative class representative’s\n\n       claims must depend upon a common contention—for example, the\n       assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor. That\n       common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable\n       of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or\n       falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of\n       the claims in one stroke.\n\nId. at 2251.\n\n       Justice Scalia next discussed commonality in the Title VII context, where\nplaintiffs like Dukes “wish to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at\nonce.” Id. at 2252. “Without some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those\n[employment] decisions together,” he wrote, “it will be impossible to say that\nexamination of all the class members’ claims for relief will produce a common answer\nto the crucial question why was I disfavored.” Ibid.\n\n       To determine whether Dukes’s class had sufficient commonality, Justice Scalia\nwent to a familiar source: Falcon. That case, he held, “describes how the commonality\nissue must be approached.” Id. at 2252–53. In Falcon, “an employee who claimed that\nhe was deliberately denied a promotion on account of race obtained certification of a\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 11\n\n\nclass comprising all employees wrongfully denied promotions and all applicants\nwrongfully denied jobs.” Id. at 2253. The Supreme Court reversed. It noted:\n\n       Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an individual’s claim that\n       he has been denied a promotion on discriminatory grounds, and his\n       otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of\n       discrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have\n       suffered the same injury as that individual, such that the individual’s\n       claim and the class claims will share common questions of law or fact\n       and that the individual's claim will be typical of the class claims.\n\nFalcon, 457 U.S. at 157. To bridge that conceptual gap, Justice Scalia reasoned, the\nparty seeking class certification must show that the defendant “used a biased testing\nprocedure,” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2553 (citing Falcon, 457 U.S. at 159 n.15), or she must\nproduce “[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of\ndiscrimination . . . if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion\npractices in the same general fashion, such as through entirely subjective decisionmaking\nprocesses.” Ibid. (citing Falcon, 457 U.S. at 159 n.15). Dukes succeeded in neither of\nthese tasks and thus did not meet Rule 23(a)(2)’s threshold commonality requirement.\n\n       Justice Scalia also held, this time for a unanimous court, that “claims for\nmonetary relief . . . may not [be certified under Rule 23(b)(2)], at least where . . . the\nmonetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.” Id. at 2557. He\nreasoned:\n\n       at a minimum, claims for individualized relief (like the backpay at issue\n       here) do not satisfy the Rule . . . . Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a\n       single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each\n       member of the class. It does not authorize class certification when each\n       individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or\n       declaratory judgment against the defendant. Similarly, it does not\n       authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled\n       to an individualized award of monetary damages.\n\nIbid. The only possible exception, Justice Scalia continued, is “monetary relief that is\nincidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief.” Id. at 2560 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But the court did not decide the issue because the monetary relief\n\fNo. 10-1662            Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                    Page 12\n\n\nDukes sought, backpay, was not incidental to declaratory or injunctive relief. To the\ncontrary, Wal–Mart had the right to raise affirmative defenses to each individual\nbackpay determination.2 “And because the necessity of that litigation will prevent\nbackpay from being ‘incidental’ to the classwide injunction,” Rule 23(b)(2) certification\nwas not appropriate. Id. at 2561.\n\n         Justice Ginsburg concurred in part and dissented in part. She agreed with Justice\nScalia’s conclusion that Rule 23(b)(2) certification was not appropriate. Id. at 2561\n(Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). She took issue, however, with\nthe majority’s interpretation of Rule 23(a)(2), arguing that the Opinion of the Court\n“import[ed] into the Rule 23(a) determination concerns properly addressed in a Rule\n23(b)(3) assessment.” Id. at 2562. “The Court’s emphasis on differences between class\nmembers,” she argued, “mimics the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry into whether common\nquestions ‘predominate’ over individual issues. And by asking whether the individual\ndifferences ‘impede’ common adjudication, the Court duplicates 23(b)(3)’s question\nwhether ‘a class action is superior’ to other modes of adjudication.” Id. at 2566.\nTherefore, while she agreed that Dukes’s claim failed under Rule 23(b)(2), she believed\nthat “[a] putative class of this type may be certifiable under Rule 23(b)(3),” and\nsuggested: “Whether the class the plaintiffs describe meets the specific requirements of\nRule 23(b)(3) . . . [should be] reserve[d] . . . for consideration and decision on remand.”\nId. at 2561.\n\n         Dukes, in many ways, is similar to this case. Each involves a challenge to a\nnational corporation’s employment practices. In each, the allegedly discriminatory\nemployment decisions are ascribed to a corporate culture allegedly unfavorable to\n\n\n         2\n            As a solution to this problem, Dukes proposed a “Trial by Formula” process. Under this system,\nthe district court would appoint a master to determine whether and how much backpay was due to a sample\nset of class members. The court would then multiply the total number of class members by the percentage\nof claims the special master determined were valid. Next, it would multiply that number by the average\nbackpay award for sample claimants with a valid claim to determine the class’s recovery. The Court did\nnot make clear whether Dukes proposed that the class’s recovery would be distributed pro rata, whether\nthere would be some sort of claims procedure, based on the particular applicant’s date of non-promotion,\nor whether class counsel would dispose of the money through a cy pres distribution. Regardless, the Court\nheld that the Trial by Formula approach would violate the Rules Enabling Act because it would abridge\nor modify Wal–Mart’s right to present affirmative defenses to individual backpay determinations. Dukes,\n131 S. Ct. at 2561.\n\fNo. 10-1662                 Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                 Page 13\n\n\nwomen. In each, applicants had to meet a basic set of criteria, but managers retained\nsignificant discretion over the challenged employment decisions. And in each, the class\nrepresentative sought to prove her discrimination claim with a combination of statistical\nand anecdotal evidence.\n\n                                                       C\n\n            The district court declined to certify Davis’s proposed class, based on Rules\n23(a)(2)–(4), and 23(b)(2)–(3). Because the district court did not abuse its discretion as\nto Rule 23(a)(2) or Rule 23(b)(2), we affirm its decision denying class certification. We\nexpress no opinion on the district court’s treatment of Rules 23(a)(3) and 23(a)(4).3\n\n                                        Rule 23(a)(2): Commonality\n\n            Under Rule 23(a)(2), a plaintiff must show that “there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Dukes clarified the scope of this\ninquiry. To satisfy Rule 23(a)(2), a plaintiff’s “claims must depend upon a common\ncontention . . . . [which is] of such a nature that it is capable of classwide\nresolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue\nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct.\nat 2551. The crucial inquiry, the court explained, is “the capacity of a classwide\nproceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”\nIbid. (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof,\n84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)). “In other words, Plaintiffs must have a common\nquestion that will connect many individual promotional decisions to their claim for class\nrelief.” Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011).\n\n            The district court held that Davis did not satisfy this requirement. It reasoned,\nfirst, that Cintas’s hiring process was not entirely subjective, and therefore might not\n“support a finding of a ‘general policy of discrimination.’” Serrano, 2009 WL 910702,\nat *5 (quoting Bacon v. Honda of Am. Mfg., 205 F.R.D. 466, 477 (S.D. Ohio 2001)). But\n\n\n            3\n                Davis does not appeal the district court’s determination that her suit does not satisfy Rule\n23(b)(3).\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 14\n\n\n“[m]ore importantly,” it continued, “the hiring process in this case is conducted by\nthousands of Cintas managers at hundreds of Cintas facilities. Hiring decisions are made\nfor a diverse range of reasons and depend on widely differing circumstances at each\nfacility.” Ibid. The district court also pointed out that Cintas’s hiring process had many\ndifferent steps and, at some points, involved hiring managers who are women\nthemselves. It reasoned, therefore: “Putative class members would have suffered the\nalleged discrimination in different ways at different stages of the hiring process, and\ndepending on the different Cintas employees involved at each hiring stage.” Ibid. The\ncourt found Davis’s statistical evidence unpersuasive, holding that Cintas’s experts\npointed to “discrepancies [that] undermine[d] a conclusion that the statistics are\nsufficient to demonstrate that there is a common, class-wide discriminatory impact\nagainst the putative class members.” Id. at *6. Equally unconvincing, it held, was Dr.\nBarbara Reskin’s expert opinion that Cintas had a white-male-dominated business\nculture, which replicated itself in hiring decisions. Finally, the court did “not find that\n[Davis’s anecdotal accounts were] . . . compelling instances of discrimination against\nwomen.” Id. *7.\n\n       In response, Davis argues that her “statistical evidence establishes a pattern of\nunderhiring across locations . . . [that] is more than sufficient to satisfy commonality.”\nAppellant’s Br. 36. She also argues that the district court erred by holding that “the\nexistence of the few minimal objective standards for the SSR job . . . per se precluded\ncertification,” ibid., and that “commonality was barred per se because the challenged\ndecisionmaking is made by multiple managers at multiple locations.” Id. at 38. Finally,\nDavis claims that the existence of individual questions, such as Cintas’s justification for\nan individual hiring decision or who Cintas hired instead of the class member, does\nnot necessarily preclude commonality.         Rather, she suggests, “these are issues\nfor . . . additional remedial proceedings.” Id. at 41.\n\n       Davis’s arguments do not show that the district court abused its discretion,\nparticularly in light of Dukes. Under the Dukes framework, Davis would have to show\nthat Cintas “used a biased testing procedure” or “operated under a general policy of\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 15\n\n\ndiscrimination.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2553. As in Dukes, the gravamen of Davis’s claim\nis not that the Meticulous Hiring System’s objective criteria led to an anti-female bias,\nbut that subjective decisions made by some of Cintas’s managers favored males because\nof Cintas’s male-dominated corporate culture.\n\n        “[S]ubjective or discretionary employment practices may be analyzed under the\ndisparate impact approach in appropriate cases.” Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust,\n487 U.S. 977, 991 (1988); accord Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2554. When plaintiffs challenge\nemployment practices in a large, national corporation, however, “demonstrating the\ninvalidity of one manager’s use of discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the\ninvalidity of another’s.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2554. Unless a plaintiff can somehow\nshow that the corporation’s managers all used “a common mode of exercising discretion\nthat pervades the entire company,” Dukes explains, “[a] party seeking to certify a\nnationwide class will be unable to show that all the employees’ Title VII claims will in\nfact depend on the answers to common questions.” Id. at 2554–55.\n\n        The court in Dukes explained that the plaintiffs’ sociological, statistical, and\nanecdotal evidence—all of which was similar to the evidence offered here—was not\nsufficient to show a uniform, companywide practice of exercising discretion in a way\nthat favored men over women. Applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, we affirm the\ndistrict court’s determination that Davis’s statistical evidence, sociological analysis, and\nanecdotal accounts did not satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). As to each type of evidence, the\ndistrict court weighed the parties’ competing arguments and found that Davis’s proffered\nevidence did not support a finding of companywide gender discrimination. We may not\noverturn this determination unless the district court “relie[d] on erroneous findings of\nfact, applie[d] the wrong legal standard, misapplie[d] the correct legal standard when\nreaching a conclusion, or ma[de] a clear error of judgment.” Pipefitters Local 636 Ins.\nFund v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mich., 654 F.3d 618, 629 (6th Cir. 2011).\n\n        Davis’s experts suggested that women and minorities were under-represented\nin service-sales-representative positions companywide. Serrano, 2009 WL 910702, at\n*6 Cintas’s experts countered by questioning Davis’s experts’ methods and models, and\n\fNo. 10-1662            Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                     Page 16\n\n\nconcluding that “although some Cintas locations under-hired women and racial\nminorities, other locations over-hired women and racial minorities during the same\nperiod.” Ibid.4 The district court found Cintas’s experts more persuasive.\n\n          Davis presented a report from Dr. Barbara Reskin, “purporting to show that a\ncommon white male business culture at Cintas tends to perpetuate its culture by\ndiscriminating against women and racial minorities.” Ibid. Cintas, of course, argued\nthat Reskin’s conclusion was untenable. “After a close consideration of the parties’\nrespective positions, the Court [concluded] . . . that Dr. Reskin’s report [was] not\npersuasive.” Ibid. It questioned Reskin’s methodology, the applicability of her general\nthesis to specific instances of discrimination, and noted that Cintas had made “sincere\nattempts to achieve greater diversity in its company.” Id. at *7.\n\n          Finally, Davis presented anecdotal evidence of Cintas managers telling women\nthat the job involved heavy lifting, entering male locker rooms, and dealing with dirty\nlaundry. The court found, first, that these statements “could be interpreted as instances\nof Cintas managers giving applicants full disclosure of the demands and duties of the\nSSR position,” and second that “[e]ven assuming that these statements constituted\nparticular instances of discrimination, commonality is not satisfied; on the contrary,\nthese statements illustrate that the circumstances of discrimination are highly\nindividualized and cannot be adequately treated in a generalized class action setting.”\nIbid.\n\n          None of these evidentiary determinations was an abuse of discretion. Combined,\nthey led the district court to the same conclusion that the Supreme Court reached in\nDukes: the plaintiff did not satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) because she could not show that a\nnumber of women, who failed to obtain employment at many places, over a long time,\nunder a largely subjective hiring system, shared a common question of law or fact. We\naffirm.\n\n\n          4\n           The district court, for the purposes of argument, accepted Davis’s data on this point, meaning\nthat it measured under- or over-hiring in relation to employment rates in certain classes of jobs, based on\none or more census codes. Census codes are numbers assigned to particular jobs (not necessarily the same\nas Cintas’s jobs) when tallying responses to a census.\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 17\n\n\n                    Rule 23(b)(2): Injunctive or Declaratory Action\n\n       Davis moved for class certification under both Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3).\nHowever, she only challenges the district court’s determination that class certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(2) was inappropriate. Any appeal from denial of certification under\nRule 23(b)(3) is, therefore, forfeited. See Miller v. Admin. Office of the Courts, 448 F.3d\n887, 893 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that issues not raised in opening appellate briefs are\nconsidered forfeited).\n\n       Rule 23(b)(2) provides that class certification is permissible where a class\nrepresentative meets all of Rule 23(a)’s requirements and “the party opposing the class\nhas acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class\nas a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n\n       The district court held that Davis did not meet this requirement because, in\naddition to seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, she sought front pay and back pay.\nSerrano, 2009 WL 910702, at *9–10. It reasoned that Cintas’s decentralized hiring\npolicy meant that it did not act in a manner that applied generally to the class, and held:\n“the damages sought by Plaintiffs would require individualized determinations\ninappropriate for a [Rule 23(b)(2)] class action.” Id. *10. Front pay and back pay\ncalculations, the court continued, would “necessarily predominate over requested\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief and the requested damages cannot be recovered pursuant\nto Rule 23(b)(2).” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The Supreme Court unanimously spoke in a similar vein in Dukes. “[W]e think,”\nit wrote, “that, at a minimum, claims for individualized relief (like the backpay at issue\nhere) do not satisfy the Rule.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. It continued:\n\n       Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory\n       judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It does not\n       authorize class certification when each individual class member would\n       be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the\n       defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each\n\fNo. 10-1662           Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                    Page 18\n\n\n         class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary\n         damages.\n\nIbid. The Court reasoned that there might be an exception to this rule if monetary relief\nwere incidental to the declaratory or injunctive relief the plaintiffs sought. Id. at 2560.\nIn the Title VII context, however, the Court held that defendants are entitled to\n“individualized determinations of each employee’s eligibility for backpay,” and thus\n“the necessity of [litigating individuals’ claims] will prevent backpay from being\nincidental to the classwide injunction.” Id. at 2560–61.\n\n         Davis claims that Dukes does not bar certification of her Rule 23(b)(2) class\naction because her “shortfall-based model” is distinguishable from the “trial-by-formula”\nsystem the Supreme Court expressly rejected in Dukes. Appellant’s Supp. Br. 4–5.\nUnder Davis’s system, the court would declare Cintas’s hiring practices discriminatory\nand issue an injunction ordering Cintas to hire class members “randomly selected in\nnumbers equal to the proven shortfalls for each facility.” Id. at 5. “Davis will [then]\ncalculate Cintas’ backpay liability for the class as a whole by multiplying the proven\nshortfall times lost wages.5 This calculation will be the limit of Cintas’ liability for\nbackpay, which will be distributed among eligible class members, pro rata.” Ibid.\n\n         The “trial-by-formula” system, which the Supreme Court rejected in Dukes, was\nsimilar. It provided that the district court would appoint a master to determine whether\nand how much backpay was due to a sample set of class members. The court would then\nmultiply the total number of class members by the percentage of claims the special\nmaster determined were valid. Next, it would multiply that number by the average\nbackpay award for sample claimants with a valid claim to determine the class’s recovery.\nDukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2560–61. The Supreme Court rejected this system under the Rules\nEnabling Act, holding that it abridged or modified Wal–Mart’s statutory right to assert\nindividual defenses to individual awards of backpay. Id. at 2561.\n\n\n         5\n          Davis’s expert calculated the shortfall as approximately 900 jobs. Appellant’s Supp. Br. 5 n.8.\nDavis does not, however, explain how it would calculate when the shortfall occurred. For instance, a\nhypothetical woman not hired in 1999 would be due substantially more than a hypothetical woman not\nhired in 2003.\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                           Page 19\n\n\n         Davis’s proposed system suffers from a similar, but even more troubling,\ninfirmity. Dukes made clear that Cintas has the right to present defenses before paying\nany person an award of backpay. Davis’s system deprives Cintas of that right. But\nworse, Davis’s “shortfall-based” model, unlike the “trial-by-formula” system, makes no\neffort to individualize damages at all. Under the “shortfall-based” model, a woman\ndenied a job in 2004 would receive precisely the same recovery as a woman denied a job\nin 1999. At least in the “trial-by-formula” system, plaintiffs have statistical similarity.\nDavis’s system for determining class recovery, therefore, is worse than the system that\nthe Supreme Court unanimously rejected in Dukes. Individualized monetary relief is\ntherefore not incidental to the injunctive and declaratory relief Davis seeks, and the\ndistrict court was correct to deny class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). Ibid.\n\n                                            III\n\n         That class certification is inappropriate in this case does not vitiate Davis’s\nindividual claims. We therefore proceed to consider whether the district court properly\ngranted summary judgment for Cintas on Davis’s individual disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact claims.\n\n         Summary judgment is appropriate when “the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment\nde novo, construing all evidence and drawing all inferences against the moving party.\nHirsch v. CSX Transp., Inc., 656 F.3d 359, 362 (6th Cir. 2011). However, “the mere\nexistence of a scintilla of evidence in support of [the non-moving party’s] position will\nbe insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the\n[non-moving party].” Shropshire v.

In the McDonnell Douglas framework, Davis must make\nout a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. at 802. If she meets this requirement,\nCintas must offer some legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for its employment\ndecision. Ibid. If the company produces such an explanation, Davis must point out\n“evidence from which a jury could reasonably reject [Cintas’s] explanation.” Chen v.\nDow Chem. Co., 580 F.3d 394, 400 (6th Cir. 2009). Davis bears this third burden, even\nwhen opposing a motion for summary judgment. Ibid. She must, therefore, point to\nevidence that, taken in a light most favorable to her, could lead a reasonable jury to\nreject Cintas’s proffered explanations.\n\n        While “a plaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find\nthat the employer’s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude\nthat the employer unlawfully discriminated,” there are also “instances where, although\nthe plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject\nthe defendant’s explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was\ndiscriminatory.” Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000).\n\n        Davis alleges two separate instances of disparate treatment—one by Richards in\n2003, and one by Cintas’s collective hiring personnel in 2004. Below, as here, Cintas\nconceded that Davis established a prima facie case of discrimination, and only litigated\nthe issue of pretext.\n\n        A plaintiff may show pretext by demonstrating: “(1) that the proffered reasons\nhad no basis in fact, (2) that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate [the adverse\nemployment action], or (3) that they were insufficient to motivate [the adverse\nemployment action].” Hedrick v. Western Reserve Care Sys., 355 F.3d 444, 460 (6th\nCir. 2004); Chen, 580 F.3d at 400. This test, however, is not rigid, and “it is important\nto avoid formalism in its application, lest one lose the forest for the trees. Pretext is a\ncommonsense inquiry: did the employer fire [or, as here, refuse to hire] the employee\nfor the stated reason or not?” Chen, 580 F.3d at 400 n.4. “[B]ecause a prima facie case\n[of discrimination] and sufficient evidence to reject the employer’s explanation may\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v.

[Davis need not] introduce additional, independent\nevidence of discrimination” to survive summary judgment. Reeves, 530 U.S. at 149.\n\n                                            1\n\n       The district court concluded that Richards’s decision not to hire Davis in 2003\nwas based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. Specifically, it held that Davis did\nnot provide evidence that Richards’s proffered reasons for not hiring her—Davis’s stated\ndislike for “up-selling,” her desire to remain employed part-time at LensCrafters, and the\nfact that she was applying for other jobs—were a pretext for gender discrimination.\nAvalos v. Cintas Corp., No. 06-12311, 2010 WL 1417804, at *7 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 5,\n2010). Davis responds that: (1) Richards’s reasons were mere speculation, since she\ncould not recall the specifics of her screening interview with Davis, and thus had to rely\non notes she made during the interview process; and (2) Richards advanced a number\nof men past the screening stage who were not as well qualified as Davis.\n\n       Davis’s first argument ignores her ultimate burden to prove pretext. To survive\nsummary judgment, Davis must provide evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to\nfind that Cintas’s proffered reasons for declining to hire her were pretextual. See Chen,\n580 F.3d at 400. While Davis questions the reliability of Richards’s “contemporaneous\n. . . business records,” Appellee’s Br. 60, she offers no evidence that Richards’s notes\nwere misleading, unreliable, or anything other than what Richards claimed they were:\na record of the red flags that motivated her not to advance Davis past the screening stage.\n\n       Davis’s second argument—that Richards’s advancing less qualified men to later\nstages of the screening process is evidence of pretext—fares better.            “Whether\nqualifications evidence will be sufficient to raise a question of fact as to pretext will\ndepend on whether a plaintiff presents other evidence of discrimination.” Bender v.\nHecht’s Dept. Stores, 455 F.3d 612, 626 (6th Cir. 2006). If a plaintiff presents such\nevidence, “that evidence, taken together with evidence that the plaintiff was as qualified\nas or better qualified than the successful applicant, might well result in the plaintiff’s\nclaim surviving summary judgment.” Id. at 626–27. If, however, “there is little or no\nother probative evidence of discrimination, to survive summary judgment the rejected\n\fNo. 10-1662           Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                 Page 22\n\n\napplicant’s qualifications must be so significantly better than the successful applicant’s\nqualifications that no reasonable employer would have chosen the latter applicant over\nthe former.” Id. at 627.\n\n        Whether Davis produces “other evidence of discrimination,” id. at 626, depends\non the outcome of a battle of experts. Davis’s expert, Dr. Thomas DiPrete, analyzed\nhiring data for Location 447. He stated: “Between 1999 and 2004, 78 men were hired\ninto SSR positions [at Location 447], but only 2 women were hired into these positions.\nAll of the hires in the period from 1999–2002 were men. During 2003 and 2004, 32\nhires occurred; 30 of these hires were men and 2 were women.” This was so, even\nthough women accounted for between 26% and 27% of service-sales-representative\napplicants and 30% to 38% of the external labor market during that time period. “No\nwomen at all were hired into SSR jobs in Cintas location 447 for the four years prior to\n2003.” From July 1, 2003 to December 31, 2004, “there were 27 hires into SSR\npositions. Only one of these hires (3.7% of the hires) was a woman even though more\nthan 25% of these applicants were women.”\n\n        To calculate the number of women available in the labor market, Dr. DiPrete\nused an amalgam of ninety-three different census codes. He “analyzed in detail the last\noccupation of a sample of approximately 300 applicants who were hired into the SSR-\nUniform or SSR-FS jobs,” and “defined labor market availability by weighting the\noccupations from which Cintas hired in proportion to their presence in [his] sample.”\n\n        Cintas’ expert witnesses, Drs. Mary Baker and Janet Thornton, claimed that Dr.\nDiPrete’s analysis was fundamentally flawed. Of importance to this discussion,6 Drs.\nBaker and Thornton criticized DiPrete for “measur[ing] availability [of applicants in the\n\n\n\n\n        6\n           Drs. Baker and Thornton also criticized DiPrete’s aggregating data from different Cintas\nlocations nationwide, and some of his methods of analyzing the aggregated data. These points, however,\nare relevant only to Davis’s class claim, since her individual claim implicates only Location 447.\n\fNo. 10-1662           Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                  Page 23\n\n\nlabor market] using the demographic composition of workers in many occupations,”\ninstead of “using hiring benchmarks based on occupation 913 alone.”7\n\n        As Drs. Baker and Thornton point out, Dr. DiPrete’s availability measure hinges\non the assumption that “the men and women . . . who work in the origin jobs are\nsimilarly interested and qualified for the SSR job.” However, as Dr. DiPrete points out,\n“census code 913 includes many jobs which are not ‘highly similar’ to the Cintas SSR\njob.” Which view to accept is ultimately an issue for the fact finder. But, in the current\nposture of this case, we must draw all inferences in Davis’s favor. We therefore assume\nthat Davis would win the battle of experts, and treat DiPrete’s statistical analysis as\nevidence of discrimination. Accordingly, we now consider whether a reasonable jury\ncould conclude that Davis was “as qualified as or better qualified than the successful\napplicant[s].” Bender, 455 F.3d at 626–27.\n\n        Location 447 hired three men soon after interviewing Davis. At least on paper,\ntheir credentials appear equal to, or slightly less impressive than, Davis’s.8 One of the\nmen, Tim Koelbl, was a onetime route sales driver for an ice company, who had a\nmaster’s degree in education. Another, Andrew Hansen, had participated in a rental car\nagency’s management program, which “stressed . . . [c]ustomer service, sales, marketing\nand management.” The third, Damian Vertz, was a former college football player, who\nhad worked as a parts technician and machine operator.\n\n        None of the three men had real-world experience in management; none had\nextensive experience in sales. Davis, by contrast, had worked as a manager for three\ndifferent companies. She had significantly more customer-service and sales experience\nthan any of the three male candidates, even if she disliked up-selling products and\nplanned to continue working for LensCrafters part-time. She was, in other words, “as\nqualified or better qualified than [any of] the successful applicant[s].” Bender, 455 F.3d\n\n        7\n          As discussed above, census codes are numbers assigned to particular jobs when tallying\nresponses to a census. Census code 913 comprises “driver/sales” jobs, including “truck driver, light or\ndelivery services . . . [and] truck driver, heavy and tractor-trailer.”\n        8\n           Since, in 2003, Davis did not advance past the application screening stage, the applicants’\nqualifications on paper are the focus of the inquiry.\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 24\n\n\nat 626–27. This, together with Dr. DiPrete’s statistical analysis, is enough at this stage.\nThe district court should not have granted summary judgment to Cintas on Davis’s\n2003 disparate-treatment claim.\n\n                                            2\n\n       The district court also rejected Davis’s 2004 disparate-treatment claim. It\nreasoned that Cintas chose not to hire Davis because of her poor performance on the\nroute ride, not because she was female. Avalos, 2010 WL 1417804, at *7. It also\ndismissed as speculation Davis’s claim that Cintas delayed another female applicant’s\nroute ride so that it could compare the two and hire one. Id. at *8.\n\n       On appeal, Davis opposes the first of these conclusions vigorously. She suggests\nthat the district court erred by holding that she did not perform well on her route ride,\nsince, in fact, the manager who conducted the route ride recommended her for a route\nthat involved less physical exertion. Appellant’s Br. 61. But, as Cintas notes, such a\nroute did not exist when Davis applied for her position. Id. at 63. The two male\ncandidates Cintas hired soon after Davis interviewed in 2004, unlike Davis, performed\nwell on their route rides, demonstrating an adequate level of physical energy for the\npositions Cintas then sought to fill. Davis has not produced evidence suggesting that\nCintas’s hiring decisions were based on these candidates’ gender, rather than their ability\nto perform necessary job functions.\n\n       Davis leaves mostly untouched the district court’s ruling that dismissed as\nspeculation her argument that Location 447 had determined to hire only one female\napplicant in 2004. She discusses the factual basis for this claim, id. at 21, but only\nmentions it in passing in her summary-judgment argument, claiming that Location 447’s\ngeneral manager wanted to hire only one woman, and deferred to a lower-level\nmanager’s preference for a woman other than Davis.                 Such a perfunctory,\nunsubstantiated statement does not preserve the issue for appeal. Davis has not carried\nher burden to create an issue of material fact on pretext. The district court was correct\nto dismiss her 2004 disparate-treatment claim.\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                         Page 25\n\n\n                                           B\n\n       “By enacting § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i), Congress allowed claims to be brought\nagainst an employer who uses a practice that causes disparate impact, whatever the\nemployer’s motives.” Lewis v. City of Chicago, 130 S. Ct. 2191, 2200 (2010). To\nestablish a prima facie disparate-impact case, a plaintiff must: (1) identify a specific\nemployment practice; and (2) present data indicating that the specific practice had an\nadverse impact on a protected group. Grant v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville and Davidson\nCnty., 446 F. App’x 737, 740 (6th Cir. 2011); see also Kovacevich v. Kent State Univ.,\n224 F.3d 806, 830 (6th Cir. 2000). “[I]f the complaining party can demonstrate to the\ncourt that the elements of a respondent’s decisionmaking process are not capable of\nseparation for analysis, the decisionmaking process may be analyzed as one employment\npractice.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i).\n\n       Once the plaintiff succeeds in making a prima facie disparate-impact case, the\ndefendant may avoid liability by showing “that the protocol in question has ‘a manifest\nrelationship to the employment.’” Dunlap v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 519 F.3d 626, 629 (6th\nCir. 2008) (citing Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971)). If the\ndefendant makes such a showing, the plaintiff’s disparate-impact claim will succeed only\nif she demonstrates “that other tests or selection protocols would serve the employer’s\ninterest without creating the undesirable discriminatory effect.” Ibid. (citing Albemarle\nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425, 432 (1975)).\n\n       The district court held that Davis failed to establish her prima facie case because\nshe did not identify a specific employment practice. Citing our decision in Phillips v.\nCohen, 400 F.3d 388, 398 (6th Cir. 2005), it explained that, while an entire\n“decisionmaking process may be analyzed as one practice,” before such analysis is\nappropriate, “the plaintiff [must] demonstrate[] that the elements of a respondent’s\ndecisionmaking process are not capable of separation for analysis.” The district court\nfound that Davis did not meet this burden. “[T]he fact that [she] advanced to different\npoints,” it reasoned, “demonstrates that the hiring process is capable of separation.”\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 26\n\n\nAvalos, 2010 WL 1417804, at *10. Thus, the district court rejected her claim at the\nthreshold.\n\n        Davis argues that the district court erred. She suggests that she did “identify the\nsystem’s subjective elements as the cause of the challenged underhiring: (a) the\nmanagers’ subjective assessment of the applications and interviews; and (b) their\nunconstrained discretion to weigh the mix of negatives and positives for each applicant.”\nAppellant’s Br. 63–64.\n\n        Davis’s briefs, below and in this court, do discuss the possibility of considering\nan entire hiring system as one employment practice when its discrete parts cannot be\nseparated for analysis. The gravamen of her claim, though, is somewhat different. At\nbottom, Davis argues that the Meticulous Hiring System’s subjective elements, together,\ncaused a disadvantage to women in Service-Sales-Representative hiring.\n\n        Even though it does not address the issue specifically, the district court’s opinion\nsuggests that, in a multi-step system, a “particular employment practice” must be one\nspecific test, or one specific manager’s exercise of discretion. Davis, by contrast,\nnecessarily claims that “particular employment practice” is broad enough to comprise\nmany different steps of a multi-step process, as long as those steps share a common\ncharacteristic: subjectivity.\n\n        To determine which of these interpretations is correct, we must give content to\nthe phrase “particular employment practice” in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i). The\nlanguage of the statute, our starting point, is somewhat enigmatic. Title VII provides:\n\n        It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer--\n\n                (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,\n                or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with\n                respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n                privileges of employment, because of such individual’s\n                race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n                (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or\n                applicants for employment in any way which would\n                deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                         Page 27\n\n\n               opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as\n               an employee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n               religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nId. at § 2000e-2(a)(1)–(2).      Section 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), however, uses the term\n“employment practice” differently. Under that section, an employer faces liability if:\n\n       a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a particular\n       employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,\n       color, religion, sex, or national origin and the respondent fails to\n       demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in\n       question and consistent with business necessity . . . .\n\nId. at § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). “Employment practice” here cannot mean the same thing\nthat it means earlier in the statute. Such a construction would make § 2000e-2(k)\nhopelessly question-begging: it would ban discrimination based on a prohibited\nclassification that causes discrimination based on a prohibited classification. Instead,\nthe two provisions must use the term in distinct ways: § 2000e-2(a) defines an act of\ndiscrimination, a specific “employment practice” in which a person must not engage.\nConversely, § 2000e-2(k) does not define a specifically forbidden act—it prohibits an\nunacceptable outcome arising from some undefined “employment practice.”\n\n       However, the starting point of § 2000e-2(k) analysis is still some discrete\n“employment practice,” that is, something that the employer does. That “something”\ncannot be the hiring system itself, since § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i) distinguishes an\n“employment practice” from “a respondent’s decisionmaking process.” Id. But whether\nthe “something” must be one isolated element of a multi-step hiring procedure, or\nwhether it can include all of the elements of such a procedure that share a common\ncharacteristic (subjectivity, for example) is not entirely clear.\n\n       The text of § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i), though, sheds some light on the issue. That\nsection softens the Supreme Court’s decision in Wards Cove Packing Co., Inc. v. Atonio,\n490 U.S. 642 (1989), superseded by statute, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k), by allowing\nplaintiffs to identify a decision-making process as the “particular employment practice”\nin a disparate-impact case if that process is incapable of separation for analysis. Section\n\fNo. 10-1662            Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                     Page 28\n\n\n2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i) requires that, as a general rule, “the complaining party [must] . . .\ndemonstrate that each particular challenged employment practice causes a disparate\nimpact.” Two features of this language are suggestive. First, the language that deals\nwith the “employment practice” is entirely in the singular, not the plural. This syntax\nwould be strange if a plaintiff could bundle a number of discrete steps of a multi-phase\nhiring process together, based on a common characteristic. Second, the words “each”\nand “particular” suggest specificity, not amalgamation.                      The text of § 2000e-\n2(k)(1)(B)(i), then, suggests that Davis must identify one specific step of the Meticulous\nHiring Process as a particular employment practice, rather than pointing to a group of\nsteps that share a common characteristic.\n\n         Precedent from the Supreme Court, our circuit, and our sister circuits supports\nthis conclusion.        True, “[i]f an employer’s undisciplined system of subjective\ndecisionmaking has precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible\nintentional discrimination . . . [the employer’s] subjective or discretionary employment\npractices may be analyzed under the disparate impact approach.” Watson, 487 U.S. at\n990–91.9 But even after Watson, “a plaintiff must [normally] demonstrate that it is the\napplication of a specific or particular employment practice that has created the disparate\nimpact under attack.” Wards Cove Packing Co., 490 U.S. at 657. It is simply not\nenough to “point out that the [hiring practices] at issue [are] relatively less generous” to\nsome workers than to others. Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 241 (2005).\n\n         We too have acknowledged that, even if an employment practice “involve[s]\nsubjectivity, [it] may nonetheless constitute [an] ‘employment practice[]’ for purposes\nof the disparate impact analysis.” Phillips, 400 F.3d at 398. At the same time, though,\n\n\n         9\n           In Dukes, Justice Scalia stated: “Other than the bare existence of delegated discretion,\nrespondents have identified no ‘specific employment practice’—much less one that ties all their 1.5 million\nclaims together.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2555–56. It is possible to argue that this language undermines\nWatson’s core holding by requiring that plaintiffs do more than allege that managers’ discretion led to\ndiscrimination. Justice Scalia, however, gave no indication that he intended such a drastic consequence,\nor even that he intended significantly to dilute Watson’s import. Indeed, he called Watson “the landmark\ncase of ours which held that giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII\nliability under a disparate-impact theory.” Id. at 2555. The better reading of this language takes into\naccount that Justice Scalia discussed Watson in the class-certification context. His point was that, on a\nnationwide scale, bare discretion was too tenuous to support class certification, absent some showing that\nall managers exercised their discretion in the same way.\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                         Page 29\n\n\nwe have emphasized “that a plaintiff is responsible for isolating and identifying the\nspecific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical\ndisparities.” Grant, 446 F. App’x at 740 (quoting Watson, 487 U.S. at 994). In keeping\nwith this obligation, we have required that “Plaintiffs make [some] effort to isolate any\n. . . [allegedly adverse] practices [and] to examine their individual effects on the\npromotions process.” Ibid. Our sister circuits have done the same. See, e.g., McClain\nv. Lufkin Indus., Inc., 519 F.3d 264, 275–78 (5th Cir. 2008) (noting that plaintiff must\n“demonstrate that each particular challenged employment practice causes a disparate\nimpact,” and upholding use of subjective decision-making as specific employment\npractice); E.E.O.C. v. Joe’s Stone Crab, Inc., 220 F.3d 1263, 1279 (11th Cir. 2000)\n(holding that subjective interview could trigger Title VII disparate-impact liability, but\nholding that liability was not appropriate because no showing of causation).\n\n       Thus, Davis did not identify a “particular employment practice” within the\nmeaning of Title VII by pointing to all of the subjective elements in the Meticulous\nHiring System. She could still survive summary judgment, however, if she showed that\nthe Meticulous Hiring System’s many steps were so intertwined that they were not\ncapable of separation for analysis. As the district court noted, though, Davis did not\nexplain why the well-defined, discrete elements of the Meticulous Hiring System are\n“not capable of separation for analysis.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i). Indeed, not\nall of the system’s subjective elements are the same. Each different interview, for\ninstance, has a specific interview guide, and different managers conduct interviews at\ndifferent stages of the process.\n\n       Of course, as Davis pointed out at oral argument, the same small group of\nmanagers does conduct all of Location 447’s interviews. And surely, Davis might urge,\nif the statistical data indicate that those managers have gender biases, their exercising\ndiscretion at different steps of the Meticulous Hiring Process should not insulate Cintas\nfrom disparate-impact liability.\n\n       This may be so, but the simple fact remains: Davis did not isolate the specific\npractices that caused the disparate impact she alleges; nor did she show that the\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                       Page 30\n\n\nmanagers’ various exercises of discretion in the Meticulous Hiring System were\nincapable of separation for analysis. Davis’s disparate impact claims for both 2003 and\n2004, therefore, fail.\n\n                                            IV\n\n        This case presents a number of complex legal and factual issues. In sum, we\n(1) AFFIRM the denial of class certification; (2) REVERSE the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on Davis’s 2003 disparate-treatment claim; and (3) AFFIRM the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment on Davis’s 2004 disparate-treatment claim\nand both of her disparate-impact claims. We remand to the district court for proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\f",

Tanesha Davis sued Cintas Corporation, individually\nand on behalf of a class of female job applicants denied employment as entry-level sales\nrepresentatives. She alleged that Cintas’s hiring practices led to gender discrimination,\nin violation of Title VII, and caused Cintas to reject her application for employment\ntwice. The district court denied Davis’s motion for class certification, and ultimately\ngranted summary judgment for Cintas on her individual claims. Davis appeals. We\naffirm the district court’s denial of class certification. We also affirm its grant of\nsummary judgment on her individual disparate-treatment claim arising in 2004 and her\ndisparate-impact claim. However, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment for Cintas on Davis’s disparate-treatment claim arising in 2003, and remand\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            I\n\n       According to Cintas’s promotional materials, service sales representatives are\n“[t]he #1 link between our customers and our company operations. The Service Sales\nRepresentative is Cintas.” More specifically, the position involves delivering and selling\nCintas’s wares—“corporate identity uniforms and value-added products”—and\nproviding direct customer service.\n\n       Although Cintas is a large corporation with many locations nationwide, its\ncorporate policy is “to run one business in many different cities instead of running\nmany different businesses in different cities.” “[A]ll Cintas operations use the same\nterminology, use the same forms and paperwork, and ‘run their stores’ the same way.”\nHiring for the service-sales-representative position is no exception. All Cintas locations\nuse—and used at all times relevant to this claim—the “Meticulous Hiring System.” This\npolicy provides: “No person will be hired in the company until [Cintas has] identified\nthe traits and competencies needed to be successful in the position. The traits and\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                           Page 3\n\n\ncompetencies must be documented in a list of ‘must have’ and ‘preferred’ hiring\nstandards for each position.”\n\n       For the service-sales-representative position, “Must Haves” include both\nobjective and subjective elements. Objectively, applicants must achieve a minimum\nscore on a standardized test given to all service-sales-representative applicants, have a\ndriver’s license and a GED or high-school diploma, and be able to lift forty pounds.\nSubjectively, applicants must demonstrate customer orientation, sales orientation,\nintegrity, dependability, achievement orientation, flexibility, stress tolerance, openness\nto differences, tenacity, initiative, persuasiveness, professionalism, compensation\ncompatibility, and a stable employment history. There are also both objective and\nsubjective “Preferreds.” Objectively, Cintas would like candidates to achieve a score\nbetween twenty-one and twenty-seven on the Wonderlic-WPT test (a type of intelligence\ntest); subjectively, it seeks candidates who have successful sales experience, successful\ncustomer-service experience, and the ability to work without supervision.\n\n       Cintas uses a sixteen-step process to determine whether candidates meet these\ncriteria. After Cintas decides that a location needs a service sales representative and\nposts the job, managers screen applications and resumes. Next, managers conduct\nscreening interviews, using a guide that contains pre-scripted questions, and invite\nqualified applicants to visit a Cintas location and take pre-employment tests. Managers\nthen collect the applicant’s application materials, and administer the Wonderlic-WPT\ntest and the “ePredix SSR Test.”        If an applicant scores well enough on these\nexaminations, she receives a “1st In-depth Interview using [Cintas’s service-sales-\nrepresentative] 1st In-depth Interview Guide.” After this first interview, qualified\napplicants go on a “route ride,” and Cintas “[c]ollect[s] paperwork,” including tax forms\nand driving records. If the applicant completes her “route ride” successfully, she\nreceives a “2nd In-depth Interview using [Cintas’s service-sales-representative] 2nd In-\ndepth Interview Guide.” The applicant’s last step is a final interview, often with a\nLocation’s general manager. Management then confers with everyone involved in the\ninterview process, performs a criminal background check, a drug screening, a driving-\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 4\n\n\nrecord and credit-record check, contacts the applicant’s references, and finally\ndetermines whether to offer the candidate a job.\n\n       Although this process has well-defined steps, set as a matter of corporate policy,\nindividual managers at different locations ultimately make the hiring decisions, based\non local needs. Cintas’s national hiring profile states that “[a]dditional Preferreds can\nbe added to accommodate the needs of the Division, Group, or Location.” Some\nlocations, for instance, emphasized sales experience over customer-service experience\nbecause of intense market competition, while others preferred the inverse because\ndifficult economic conditions made keeping existing customers crucial.\n\n       Service sales representatives were historically male. From June 1999 to October\n2006, more than ninety percent of the managers charged with hiring service sales\nrepresentatives were male. This overwhelmingly male group overwhelmingly hired\nmales. After Cintas implemented the Meticulous Hiring System in 2003, however,\nfemale hiring rose dramatically. Between 1999 and 2002, the percentage of women hired\nfor the service-sales-representative position never rose above seven percent. In 2003,\nthe year corporate-level management instructed other managers to “put the myth that\nfemales cannot be SSRs out of [their] mind and hire more women SSRs,” and\nimplemented the Meticulous Hiring System, that number rose to 7.8 percent. In 2004,\nit rose to 10.9 percent, and in 2005 it rose to 20.8 percent.\n\n        Anecdotal accounts support the data suggesting that Cintas managers saw the\nservice-sales-representative position as a man’s position. According to a former\nmanager, who was male, other managers at one Cintas location opined that women could\nnot handle the responsibilities of a service sales representative. Sharon Punch-Johnson,\na female applicant who was ultimately rejected, averred that a manager asked whether\nher husband would be comfortable with his wife working predominantly with males. In\nher deposition, Kristi Clement Williams, another female applicant, claimed that a Cintas\nmanager suggested that females might not be comfortable in the service-sales-\nrepresentative position because the job required going into men’s locker rooms, and\ndepended on interactions with customers in “a predominantly male environment.” Still\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                           Page 5\n\n\nanother female applicant claimed in a declaration that a Cintas manager bluntly told her:\n“Cintas preferred to hire men in [the service-sales-representative] position[].”\n\n       Tanesha Davis, then a store manager for LensCrafters, first applied for a service-\nsales-representative position at Cintas’s Franklin, Wisconsin location, Location 447, in\n2003. Human-Resources Manager Christine Richards conducted a screening interview\nand took notes.     Although she does not now recall the interview, Richards’s\ncontemporaneous notes suggest that she rejected Davis at the screening stage because\nDavis said that she disliked having to sell products that she considered overpriced, and\nthat she wanted to continue working another job part-time. Richards, of course, is\nadamant that she did not reject Davis because of her race or gender. Rather, Richards\nclaims, Davis was simply not the best-qualified applicant for Location 447’s available\nservice-sales-representative position. Approximately three months before Davis applied,\nLocation 447 had hired another female service sales representative. It hired one male\nservice sales representative just before Davis applied, and another two while her\napplication was pending.\n\n       Davis applied again one year later. This time, she advanced further into the\nhiring process. She passed her initial screening interview, even though she expressed\nconcerns about working in bad weather, and achieved the second highest score recorded\nduring 2003 and 2004 on one of Cintas’s standardized tests. Matt Presendofer, the\nmanager who observed Davis’s route ride, reported that “she did a lot of things well out\non the route.” Presendofer even opined that, “from a customer standpoint . . . and from\na sales standpoint[] [s]he had all the . . . attributes we wanted for a SSR candidate.” He\nexpressed concerns, however, about her level of physical energy and her efficiency. As\nin 2003, Cintas ultimately chose not to hire Davis. Eight days after Davis’s route ride\nin 2004, Location 447 hired another woman. While her 2004 application was pending\nCintas hired three male service sales representatives, and hired a fourth man within two\nmonths after rejecting Davis’s application.\n\n       This lawsuit, though, did not start with Davis. It began instead in January 2004\nin the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, where a group\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v.

Page 6\n\n\nof Cintas employees, which did not include Davis, filed a civil-rights class-action lawsuit\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The plaintiffs\namended their complaint five months later, adding a Title VII claim, a claim under the\nCalifornia Fair Employment and Housing Act, and two additional plaintiffs. The parties\nthen agreed to transfer the California action to the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Michigan, where another hiring-discrimination case was pending\nagainst Cintas, and to consolidate the two cases for pretrial proceedings.\n\n       Cintas next moved (1) for summary judgment on the individual claims of one of\nthe California plaintiffs, and (2) to limit the Michigan case’s purportedly nationwide\nclass to the State of Michigan. Counsel in the California case sought leave to add Davis\nand another woman, Cindy Patterson, as named plaintiffs.\n\n       While these motions were pending, plaintiffs in both cases made a joint motion\nto certify a class, consisting of “all females who unsuccessfully applied for the SSR job\nat any time on or after June 12, 1999.” They requested certification for claims involving\ndeclaratory and equitable relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and\ncertification for their classwide punitive-damages claim under Rule 23(b)(3). Before\nresolving the class-certification motion, the district court granted leave to add Davis and\nPatterson as plaintiffs, granted summary judgment for Cintas on the California plaintiff’s\nclaim, and limited the Michigan claims to Michigan.\n\n       Ultimately, the district court denied class certification.

P. 23(a)(1)–(4).1 If the plaintiff does not satisfy each of these requirements,\nher class claim fails at the threshold. If, however, the plaintiff shows that she is an\nappropriate representative within the meaning of Rule 23(a), the focus shifts to the case\nitself.\n\n          Under Rule 23(b), four types of lawsuits may proceed as class actions.\nSpecifically, class resolution is appropriate when:\n\n          (1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members\n          would create a risk of:\n                   (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to\n                   individual class members that would establish\n                   incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing\n                   the class; or\n                   (B) adjudications with respect to individual class\n                   members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive\n                   of the interests of the other members not parties to the\n                   individual adjudications or would substantially impair or\n                   impede their ability to protect their interests;\n          (2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\n          that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\n          corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a\n          whole; or\n          (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class\n          members predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n          members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods\n          for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)–(3). If the plaintiff’s claim does not fall into one of these\ncategories, class certification is inappropriate, even if the plaintiff meets each of Rule\n23(a)’s four threshold requirements.\n\n          In sum, then, a plaintiff must show that she meets all four Rule 23(a) criteria, and\nthat her case falls into at least one of the four Rule 23(b) categories. If she fails to satisfy\nany of these requirements, class certification is not appropriate.\n\n\n          1\n          Some courts also impose two “implicit requirements,” definiteness and membership in the class,\nin addition to Rules 23(a)(1)–(4). See 5 HERBERT B. NEWBERG & ALBA CONTE, NEWBERG ON CLASS\nACTIONS § 3:1 (2011). These supplemental—perhaps superfluous—prerequisites, however, are not at issue\nhere.\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v.

In 2011,\nthe Supreme Court addressed this particular type of class certification in Dukes.\nAccordingly, our first task is to determine precisely what impact that case has on Davis’s\nbid for class certification.\n\n        Dukes, like this case, involved allegations of gender discrimination. The\nplaintiffs alleged that Wal–Mart systematically discriminated against women in pay and\npromotion decisions. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2547.

[The plaintiffs] therefore wish[ed] to litigate the Title VII\n       claims of all female employees at Wal–Mart’s stores in a nationwide\n       class action.\n\nId. at 2548. They sought “injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages, and\nbackpay,” but not compensatory damages. Ibid.\n\n       For a 5–4 majority, Justice Scalia held that the case could not proceed as a class\naction because the plaintiffs could not establish commonality, within the meaning of\nRule 23(a)(2). He began by noting that, to have suffered a violation of the same\nprovision of law—Title VII, for instance—is not necessarily to have suffered the same\ninjury. To satisfy commonality, Justice Scalia reasoned, a putative class representative’s\n\n       claims must depend upon a common contention—for example, the\n       assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor. That\n       common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable\n       of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or\n       falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of\n       the claims in one stroke.\n\nId. at 2251.\n\n       Justice Scalia next discussed commonality in the Title VII context, where\nplaintiffs like Dukes “wish to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at\nonce.” Id. at 2252. “Without some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those\n[employment] decisions together,” he wrote, “it will be impossible to say that\nexamination of all the class members’ claims for relief will produce a common answer\nto the crucial question why was I disfavored.” Ibid.\n\n       To determine whether Dukes’s class had sufficient commonality, Justice Scalia\nwent to a familiar source: Falcon. That case, he held, “describes how the commonality\nissue must be approached.” Id. at 2252–53. In Falcon, “an employee who claimed that\nhe was deliberately denied a promotion on account of race obtained certification of a\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 11\n\n\nclass comprising all employees wrongfully denied promotions and all applicants\nwrongfully denied jobs.” Id. at 2253. The Supreme Court reversed. It noted:\n\n       Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an individual’s claim that\n       he has been denied a promotion on discriminatory grounds, and his\n       otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of\n       discrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have\n       suffered the same injury as that individual, such that the individual’s\n       claim and the class claims will share common questions of law or fact\n       and that the individual's claim will be typical of the class claims.\n\nFalcon, 457 U.S. at 157. To bridge that conceptual gap, Justice Scalia reasoned, the\nparty seeking class certification must show that the defendant “used a biased testing\nprocedure,” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2553 (citing Falcon, 457 U.S. at 159 n.15), or she must\nproduce “[s]ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of\ndiscrimination . . . if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion\npractices in the same general fashion, such as through entirely subjective decisionmaking\nprocesses.” Ibid. (citing Falcon, 457 U.S. at 159 n.15). Dukes succeeded in neither of\nthese tasks and thus did not meet Rule 23(a)(2)’s threshold commonality requirement.\n\n       Justice Scalia also held, this time for a unanimous court, that “claims for\nmonetary relief . . . may not [be certified under Rule 23(b)(2)], at least where . . . the\nmonetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief.” Id. at 2557. He\nreasoned:\n\n       at a minimum, claims for individualized relief (like the backpay at issue\n       here) do not satisfy the Rule . . . . Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a\n       single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each\n       member of the class. It does not authorize class certification when each\n       individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or\n       declaratory judgment against the defendant. Similarly, it does not\n       authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled\n       to an individualized award of monetary damages.\n\nIbid. The only possible exception, Justice Scalia continued, is “monetary relief that is\nincidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief.” Id. at 2560 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But the court did not decide the issue because the monetary relief\n\fNo. 10-1662            Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                    Page 12\n\n\nDukes sought, backpay, was not incidental to declaratory or injunctive relief. To the\ncontrary, Wal–Mart had the right to raise affirmative defenses to each individual\nbackpay determination.2 “And because the necessity of that litigation will prevent\nbackpay from being ‘incidental’ to the classwide injunction,” Rule 23(b)(2) certification\nwas not appropriate. Id. at 2561.\n\n         Justice Ginsburg concurred in part and dissented in part. She agreed with Justice\nScalia’s conclusion that Rule 23(b)(2) certification was not appropriate. Id. at 2561\n(Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). She took issue, however, with\nthe majority’s interpretation of Rule 23(a)(2), arguing that the Opinion of the Court\n“import[ed] into the Rule 23(a) determination concerns properly addressed in a Rule\n23(b)(3) assessment.” Id. at 2562. “The Court’s emphasis on differences between class\nmembers,” she argued, “mimics the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry into whether common\nquestions ‘predominate’ over individual issues. And by asking whether the individual\ndifferences ‘impede’ common adjudication, the Court duplicates 23(b)(3)’s question\nwhether ‘a class action is superior’ to other modes of adjudication.” Id. at 2566.\nTherefore, while she agreed that Dukes’s claim failed under Rule 23(b)(2), she believed\nthat “[a] putative class of this type may be certifiable under Rule 23(b)(3),” and\nsuggested: “Whether the class the plaintiffs describe meets the specific requirements of\nRule 23(b)(3) . . . [should be] reserve[d] . . . for consideration and decision on remand.”\nId. at 2561.\n\n         Dukes, in many ways, is similar to this case. Each involves a challenge to a\nnational corporation’s employment practices. In each, the allegedly discriminatory\nemployment decisions are ascribed to a corporate culture allegedly unfavorable to\n\n\n         2\n            As a solution to this problem, Dukes proposed a “Trial by Formula” process. Under this system,\nthe district court would appoint a master to determine whether and how much backpay was due to a sample\nset of class members. The court would then multiply the total number of class members by the percentage\nof claims the special master determined were valid. Next, it would multiply that number by the average\nbackpay award for sample claimants with a valid claim to determine the class’s recovery. The Court did\nnot make clear whether Dukes proposed that the class’s recovery would be distributed pro rata, whether\nthere would be some sort of claims procedure, based on the particular applicant’s date of non-promotion,\nor whether class counsel would dispose of the money through a cy pres distribution. Regardless, the Court\nheld that the Trial by Formula approach would violate the Rules Enabling Act because it would abridge\nor modify Wal–Mart’s right to present affirmative defenses to individual backpay determinations.

In each, applicants had to meet a basic set of criteria, but managers retained\nsignificant discretion over the challenged employment decisions.

Because the district court did not abuse its discretion as\nto Rule 23(a)(2) or Rule 23(b)(2), we affirm its decision denying class certification. We\nexpress no opinion on the district court’s treatment of Rules 23(a)(3) and 23(a)(4).3\n\n                                        Rule 23(a)(2): Commonality\n\n            Under Rule 23(a)(2), a plaintiff must show that “there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Dukes clarified the scope of this\ninquiry. To satisfy Rule 23(a)(2), a plaintiff’s “claims must depend upon a common\ncontention . . . .

Hiring decisions are made\nfor a diverse range of reasons and depend on widely differing circumstances at each\nfacility.” Ibid. The district court also pointed out that Cintas’s hiring process had many\ndifferent steps and, at some points, involved hiring managers who are women\nthemselves. It reasoned, therefore: “Putative class members would have suffered the\nalleged discrimination in different ways at different stages of the hiring process, and\ndepending on the different Cintas employees involved at each hiring stage.” Ibid. The\ncourt found Davis’s statistical evidence unpersuasive, holding that Cintas’s experts\npointed to “discrepancies [that] undermine[d] a conclusion that the statistics are\nsufficient to demonstrate that there is a common, class-wide discriminatory impact\nagainst the putative class members.” Id. at *6. Equally unconvincing, it held, was Dr.\nBarbara Reskin’s expert opinion that Cintas had a white-male-dominated business\nculture, which replicated itself in hiring decisions. Finally, the court did “not find that\n[Davis’s anecdotal accounts were] . . . compelling instances of discrimination against\nwomen.” Id. *7.\n\n       In response, Davis argues that her “statistical evidence establishes a pattern of\nunderhiring across locations . . . [that] is more than sufficient to satisfy commonality.”\nAppellant’s Br. 36. She also argues that the district court erred by holding that “the\nexistence of the few minimal objective standards for the SSR job . . . per se precluded\ncertification,” ibid., and that “commonality was barred per se because the challenged\ndecisionmaking is made by multiple managers at multiple locations.” Id. at 38. Finally,\nDavis claims that the existence of individual questions, such as Cintas’s justification for\nan individual hiring decision or who Cintas hired instead of the class member, does\nnot necessarily preclude commonality.         Rather, she suggests, “these are issues\nfor . . . additional remedial proceedings.” Id. at 41.\n\n       Davis’s arguments do not show that the district court abused its discretion,\nparticularly in light of Dukes. Under the Dukes framework, Davis would have to show\nthat Cintas “used a biased testing procedure” or “operated under a general policy of\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v.

As in Dukes, the gravamen of Davis’s claim\nis not that the Meticulous Hiring System’s objective criteria led to an anti-female bias,\nbut that subjective decisions made by some of Cintas’s managers favored males because\nof Cintas’s male-dominated corporate culture.\n\n        “[S]ubjective or discretionary employment practices may be analyzed under the\ndisparate impact approach in appropriate cases.” Watson v.

Ct. at 2554. When plaintiffs challenge\nemployment practices in a large, national corporation, however, “demonstrating the\ninvalidity of one manager’s use of discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the\ninvalidity of another’s.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2554. Unless a plaintiff can somehow\nshow that the corporation’s managers all used “a common mode of exercising discretion\nthat pervades the entire company,” Dukes explains, “[a] party seeking to certify a\nnationwide class will be unable to show that all the employees’ Title VII claims will in\nfact depend on the answers to common questions.” Id. at 2554–55.\n\n        The court in Dukes explained that the plaintiffs’ sociological, statistical, and\nanecdotal evidence—all of which was similar to the evidence offered here—was not\nsufficient to show a uniform, companywide practice of exercising discretion in a way\nthat favored men over women. Applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, we affirm the\ndistrict court’s determination that Davis’s statistical evidence, sociological analysis, and\nanecdotal accounts did not satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). As to each type of evidence, the\ndistrict court weighed the parties’ competing arguments and found that Davis’s proffered\nevidence did not support a finding of companywide gender discrimination.

Cintas, of course, argued\nthat Reskin’s conclusion was untenable. “After a close consideration of the parties’\nrespective positions, the Court [concluded] . . . that Dr. Reskin’s report [was] not\npersuasive.” Ibid. It questioned Reskin’s methodology, the applicability of her general\nthesis to specific instances of discrimination, and noted that Cintas had made “sincere\nattempts to achieve greater diversity in its company.” Id. at *7.\n\n          Finally, Davis presented anecdotal evidence of Cintas managers telling women\nthat the job involved heavy lifting, entering male locker rooms, and dealing with dirty\nlaundry. The court found, first, that these statements “could be interpreted as instances\nof Cintas managers giving applicants full disclosure of the demands and duties of the\nSSR position,” and second that “[e]ven assuming that these statements constituted\nparticular instances of discrimination, commonality is not satisfied; on the contrary,\nthese statements illustrate that the circumstances of discrimination are highly\nindividualized and cannot be adequately treated in a generalized class action setting.”\nIbid.\n\n          None of these evidentiary determinations was an abuse of discretion. Combined,\nthey led the district court to the same conclusion that the Supreme Court reached in\nDukes: the plaintiff did not satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) because she could not show that a\nnumber of women, who failed to obtain employment at many places, over a long time,\nunder a largely subjective hiring system, shared a common question of law or fact. We\naffirm.\n\n\n          4\n           The district court, for the purposes of argument, accepted Davis’s data on this point, meaning\nthat it measured under- or over-hiring in relation to employment rates in certain classes of jobs, based on\none or more census codes. Census codes are numbers assigned to particular jobs (not necessarily the same\nas Cintas’s jobs) when tallying responses to a census.\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v.

R. Civ.

It does not\n       authorize class certification when each individual class member would\n       be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the\n       defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each\n\fNo. 10-1662           Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                    Page 18\n\n\n         class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary\n         damages.\n\nIbid. The Court reasoned that there might be an exception to this rule if monetary relief\nwere incidental to the declaratory or injunctive relief the plaintiffs sought. Id. at 2560.\nIn the Title VII context, however, the Court held that defendants are entitled to\n“individualized determinations of each employee’s eligibility for backpay,” and thus\n“the necessity of [litigating individuals’ claims] will prevent backpay from being\nincidental to the classwide injunction.” Id. at 2560–61.\n\n         Davis claims that Dukes does not bar certification of her Rule 23(b)(2) class\naction because her “shortfall-based model” is distinguishable from the “trial-by-formula”\nsystem the Supreme Court expressly rejected in Dukes. Appellant’s Supp. Br. 4–5.\nUnder Davis’s system, the court would declare Cintas’s hiring practices discriminatory\nand issue an injunction ordering Cintas to hire class members “randomly selected in\nnumbers equal to the proven shortfalls for each facility.” Id. at 5. “Davis will [then]\ncalculate Cintas’ backpay liability for the class as a whole by multiplying the proven\nshortfall times lost wages.5 This calculation will be the limit of Cintas’ liability for\nbackpay, which will be distributed among eligible class members, pro rata.” Ibid.\n\n         The “trial-by-formula” system, which the Supreme Court rejected in Dukes, was\nsimilar. It provided that the district court would appoint a master to determine whether\nand how much backpay was due to a sample set of class members. The court would then\nmultiply the total number of class members by the percentage of claims the special\nmaster determined were valid. Next, it would multiply that number by the average\nbackpay award for sample claimants with a valid claim to determine the class’s recovery.\nDukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2560–61. The Supreme Court rejected this system under the Rules\nEnabling Act, holding that it abridged or modified Wal–Mart’s statutory right to assert\nindividual defenses to individual awards of backpay. Id. at 2561.\n\n\n         5\n          Davis’s expert calculated the shortfall as approximately 900 jobs. Appellant’s Supp. Br. 5 n.8.\nDavis does not, however, explain how it would calculate when the shortfall occurred. For instance, a\nhypothetical woman not hired in 1999 would be due substantially more than a hypothetical woman not\nhired in 2003.\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                           Page 19\n\n\n         Davis’s proposed system suffers from a similar, but even more troubling,\ninfirmity. Dukes made clear that Cintas has the right to present defenses before paying\nany person an award of backpay. Davis’s system deprives Cintas of that right. But\nworse, Davis’s “shortfall-based” model, unlike the “trial-by-formula” system, makes no\neffort to individualize damages at all. Under the “shortfall-based” model, a woman\ndenied a job in 2004 would receive precisely the same recovery as a woman denied a job\nin 1999. At least in the “trial-by-formula” system, plaintiffs have statistical similarity.\nDavis’s system for determining class recovery, therefore, is worse than the system that\nthe Supreme Court unanimously rejected in Dukes. Individualized monetary relief is\ntherefore not incidental to the injunctive and declaratory relief Davis seeks, and the\ndistrict court was correct to deny class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). Ibid.\n\n                                            III\n\n         That class certification is inappropriate in this case does not vitiate Davis’s\nindividual claims. We therefore proceed to consider whether the district court properly\ngranted summary judgment for Cintas on Davis’s individual disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact claims.\n\n         Summary judgment is appropriate when “the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law.” Fed.

Specifically, it held that Davis did\nnot provide evidence that Richards’s proffered reasons for not hiring her—Davis’s stated\ndislike for “up-selling,” her desire to remain employed part-time at LensCrafters, and the\nfact that she was applying for other jobs—were a pretext for gender discrimination.\nAvalos v. Cintas Corp., No. 06-12311, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1417804</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 5,\n2010). Davis responds that: (1) Richards’s reasons were mere speculation, since she\ncould not recall the specifics of her screening interview with Davis, and thus had to rely\non notes she made during the interview process; and (2) Richards advanced a number\nof men past the screening stage who were not as well qualified as Davis.\n\n       Davis’s first argument ignores her ultimate burden to prove pretext. To survive\nsummary judgment, Davis must provide evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to\nfind that Cintas’s proffered reasons for declining to hire her were pretextual. See Chen,\n580 F.3d at 400. While Davis questions the reliability of Richards’s “contemporaneous\n. . . business records,” Appellee’s Br. 60, she offers no evidence that Richards’s notes\nwere misleading, unreliable, or anything other than what Richards claimed they were:\na record of the red flags that motivated her not to advance Davis past the screening stage.\n\n       Davis’s second argument—that Richards’s advancing less qualified men to later\nstages of the screening process is evidence of pretext—fares better.            “Whether\nqualifications evidence will be sufficient to raise a question of fact as to pretext will\ndepend on whether a plaintiff presents other evidence of discrimination.” Bender v.\nHecht’s Dept.

Davis’s expert, Dr. Thomas DiPrete, analyzed\nhiring data for Location 447. He stated: “Between 1999 and 2004, 78 men were hired\ninto SSR positions [at Location 447], but only 2 women were hired into these positions.\nAll of the hires in the period from 1999–2002 were men. During 2003 and 2004, 32\nhires occurred; 30 of these hires were men and 2 were women.” This was so, even\nthough women accounted for between 26% and 27% of service-sales-representative\napplicants and 30% to 38% of the external labor market during that time period. “No\nwomen at all were hired into SSR jobs in Cintas location 447 for the four years prior to\n2003.” From July 1, 2003 to December 31, 2004, “there were 27 hires into SSR\npositions. Only one of these hires (3.7% of the hires) was a woman even though more\nthan 25% of these applicants were women.”\n\n        To calculate the number of women available in the labor market, Dr. DiPrete\nused an amalgam of ninety-three different census codes. He “analyzed in detail the last\noccupation of a sample of approximately 300 applicants who were hired into the SSR-\nUniform or SSR-FS jobs,” and “defined labor market availability by weighting the\noccupations from which Cintas hired in proportion to their presence in [his] sample.”\n\n        Cintas’ expert witnesses, Drs. Mary Baker and Janet Thornton, claimed that Dr.\nDiPrete’s analysis was fundamentally flawed. Of importance to this discussion,6 Drs.\nBaker and Thornton criticized DiPrete for “measur[ing] availability [of applicants in the\n\n\n\n\n        6\n           Drs. Baker and Thornton also criticized DiPrete’s aggregating data from different Cintas\nlocations nationwide, and some of his methods of analyzing the aggregated data. These points, however,\nare relevant only to Davis’s class claim, since her individual claim implicates only Location 447.\n\fNo. 10-1662           Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                  Page 23\n\n\nlabor market] using the demographic composition of workers in many occupations,”\ninstead of “using hiring benchmarks based on occupation 913 alone.”7\n\n        As Drs. Baker and Thornton point out, Dr. DiPrete’s availability measure hinges\non the assumption that “the men and women . . . who work in the origin jobs are\nsimilarly interested and qualified for the SSR job.” However, as Dr. DiPrete points out,\n“census code 913 includes many jobs which are not ‘highly similar’ to the Cintas SSR\njob.” Which view to accept is ultimately an issue for the fact finder. But, in the current\nposture of this case, we must draw all inferences in Davis’s favor. We therefore assume\nthat Davis would win the battle of experts, and treat DiPrete’s statistical analysis as\nevidence of discrimination. Accordingly, we now consider whether a reasonable jury\ncould conclude that Davis was “as qualified as or better qualified than the successful\napplicant[s].” Bender, 455 F.3d at 626–27.\n\n        Location 447 hired three men soon after interviewing Davis. At least on paper,\ntheir credentials appear equal to, or slightly less impressive than, Davis’s.8 One of the\nmen, Tim Koelbl, was a onetime route sales driver for an ice company, who had a\nmaster’s degree in education. Another, Andrew Hansen, had participated in a rental car\nagency’s management program, which “stressed . . . [c]ustomer service, sales, marketing\nand management.” The third, Damian Vertz, was a former college football player, who\nhad worked as a parts technician and machine operator.\n\n        None of the three men had real-world experience in management; none had\nextensive experience in sales. Davis, by contrast, had worked as a manager for three\ndifferent companies. She had significantly more customer-service and sales experience\nthan any of the three male candidates, even if she disliked up-selling products and\nplanned to continue working for LensCrafters part-time. She was, in other words, “as\nqualified or better qualified than [any of] the successful applicant[s].” Bender, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n        <span class=\"page\">7</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n          As discussed above, census codes are numbers assigned to particular jobs when tallying\nresponses to a census. Census code 913 comprises “driver/sales” jobs, including “truck driver, light or\ndelivery services . . . [and] truck driver, heavy and tractor-trailer.”\n        8\n           Since, in 2003, Davis did not advance past the application screening stage, the applicants’\nqualifications on paper are the focus of the inquiry.\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                          Page 24\n\n\nat 626–27. This, together with Dr. DiPrete’s statistical analysis, is enough at this stage.\nThe district court should not have granted summary judgment to Cintas on Davis’s\n2003 disparate-treatment claim.\n\n                                            2\n\n       The district court also rejected Davis’s 2004 disparate-treatment claim. It\nreasoned that Cintas chose not to hire Davis because of her poor performance on the\nroute ride, not because she was female. Avalos, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1417804</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7. It also\ndismissed as speculation Davis’s claim that Cintas delayed another female applicant’s\nroute ride so that it could compare the two and hire one. Id. at *8.\n\n       On appeal, Davis opposes the first of these conclusions vigorously. She suggests\nthat the district court erred by holding that she did not perform well on her route ride,\nsince, in fact, the manager who conducted the route ride recommended her for a route\nthat involved less physical exertion. Appellant’s Br. 61. But, as Cintas notes, such a\nroute did not exist when Davis applied for her position. Id. at 63. The two male\ncandidates Cintas hired soon after Davis interviewed in 2004, unlike Davis, performed\nwell on their route rides, demonstrating an adequate level of physical energy for the\npositions Cintas then sought to fill. Davis has not produced evidence suggesting that\nCintas’s hiring decisions were based on these candidates’ gender, rather than their ability\nto perform necessary job functions.\n\n       Davis leaves mostly untouched the district court’s ruling that dismissed as\nspeculation her argument that Location 447 had determined to hire only one female\napplicant in 2004. She discusses the factual basis for this claim, id. at 21, but only\nmentions it in passing in her summary-judgment argument, claiming that Location 447’s\ngeneral manager wanted to hire only one woman, and deferred to a lower-level\nmanager’s preference for a woman other than Davis.                 Such a perfunctory,\nunsubstantiated statement does not preserve the issue for appeal. Davis has not carried\nher burden to create an issue of material fact on pretext. The district court was correct\nto dismiss her 2004 disparate-treatment claim.\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.

Thus, the district court rejected her claim at the\nthreshold.\n\n        Davis argues that the district court erred. She suggests that she did “identify the\nsystem’s subjective elements as the cause of the challenged underhiring: (a) the\nmanagers’ subjective assessment of the applications and interviews; and (b) their\nunconstrained discretion to weigh the mix of negatives and positives for each applicant.”\nAppellant’s Br. 63–64.\n\n        Davis’s briefs, below and in this court, do discuss the possibility of considering\nan entire hiring system as one employment practice when its discrete parts cannot be\nseparated for analysis. The gravamen of her claim, though, is somewhat different. At\nbottom, Davis argues that the Meticulous Hiring System’s subjective elements, together,\ncaused a disadvantage to women in Service-Sales-Representative hiring.\n\n        Even though it does not address the issue specifically, the district court’s opinion\nsuggests that, in a multi-step system, a “particular employment practice” must be one\nspecific test, or one specific manager’s exercise of discretion. Davis, by contrast,\nnecessarily claims that “particular employment practice” is broad enough to comprise\nmany different steps of a multi-step process, as long as those steps share a common\ncharacteristic: subjectivity.\n\n        To determine which of these interpretations is correct, we must give content to\nthe phrase “particular employment practice” in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i). The\nlanguage of the statute, our starting point, is somewhat enigmatic. Title VII provides:\n\n        It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer--\n\n                (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,\n                or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with\n                respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n                privileges of employment, because of such individual’s\n                race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n                (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or\n                applicants for employment in any way which would\n                deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                         Page 27\n\n\n               opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as\n               an employee, because of such individual’s race, color,\n               religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nId. at § 2000e-2(a)(1)–(2).      Section 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), however, uses the term\n“employment practice” differently. Under that section, an employer faces liability if:\n\n       a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a particular\n       employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,\n       color, religion, sex, or national origin and the respondent fails to\n       demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in\n       question and consistent with business necessity . . . .\n\nId. at § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). “Employment practice” here cannot mean the same thing\nthat it means earlier in the statute. Such a construction would make § 2000e-2(k)\nhopelessly question-begging: it would ban discrimination based on a prohibited\nclassification that causes discrimination based on a prohibited classification. Instead,\nthe two provisions must use the term in distinct ways: § 2000e-2(a) defines an act of\ndiscrimination, a specific “employment practice” in which a person must not engage.\nConversely, § 2000e-2(k) does not define a specifically forbidden act—it prohibits an\nunacceptable outcome arising from some undefined “employment practice.”\n\n       However, the starting point of § 2000e-2(k) analysis is still some discrete\n“employment practice,” that is, something that the employer does. That “something”\ncannot be the hiring system itself, since § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i) distinguishes an\n“employment practice” from “a respondent’s decisionmaking process.” Id. But whether\nthe “something” must be one isolated element of a multi-step hiring procedure, or\nwhether it can include all of the elements of such a procedure that share a common\ncharacteristic (subjectivity, for example) is not entirely clear.\n\n       The text of § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i), though, sheds some light on the issue.

Section\n\fNo. 10-1662            Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                                     Page 28\n\n\n2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i) requires that, as a general rule, “the complaining party [must] . . .\ndemonstrate that each particular challenged employment practice causes a disparate\nimpact.” Two features of this language are suggestive. First, the language that deals\nwith the “employment practice” is entirely in the singular, not the plural. This syntax\nwould be strange if a plaintiff could bundle a number of discrete steps of a multi-phase\nhiring process together, based on a common characteristic. Second, the words “each”\nand “particular” suggest specificity, not amalgamation.                      The text of § 2000e-\n2(k)(1)(B)(i), then, suggests that Davis must identify one specific step of the Meticulous\nHiring Process as a particular employment practice, rather than pointing to a group of\nsteps that share a common characteristic.\n\n         Precedent from the Supreme Court, our circuit, and our sister circuits supports\nthis conclusion.        True, “[i]f an employer’s undisciplined system of subjective\ndecisionmaking has precisely the same effects as a system pervaded by impermissible\nintentional discrimination . . . [the employer’s] subjective or discretionary employment\npractices may be analyzed under the disparate impact approach.” Watson, 487 U.S. at\n990–91.9 But even after Watson, “a plaintiff must [normally] demonstrate that it is the\napplication of a specific or particular employment practice that has created the disparate\nimpact under attack.” Wards Cove Packing Co., 490 U.S. at 657. It is simply not\nenough to “point out that the [hiring practices] at issue [are] relatively less generous” to\nsome workers than to others. Smith v. City of Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241 (2005).\n\n         We too have acknowledged that, even if an employment practice “involve[s]\nsubjectivity, [it] may nonetheless constitute [an] ‘employment practice[]’ for purposes\nof the disparate impact analysis.” Phillips, 400 F.3d at 398. At the same time, though,\n\n\n         9\n           In Dukes, Justice Scalia stated: “Other than the bare existence of delegated discretion,\nrespondents have identified no ‘specific employment practice’—much less one that ties all their 1.5 million\nclaims together.” Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2555–56. It is possible to argue that this language undermines\nWatson’s core holding by requiring that plaintiffs do more than allege that managers’ discretion led to\ndiscrimination. Justice Scalia, however, gave no indication that he intended such a drastic consequence,\nor even that he intended significantly to dilute Watson’s import. Indeed, he called Watson “the landmark\ncase of ours which held that giving discretion to lower-level supervisors can be the basis of Title VII\nliability under a disparate-impact theory.” Id. at 2555. The better reading of this language takes into\naccount that Justice Scalia discussed Watson in the class-certification context. His point was that, on a\nnationwide scale, bare discretion was too tenuous to support class certification, absent some showing that\nall managers exercised their discretion in the same way.\n\fNo. 10-1662        Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                         Page 29\n\n\nwe have emphasized “that a plaintiff is responsible for isolating and identifying the\nspecific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical\ndisparities.” Grant, 446 F. App’x at 740 (quoting Watson, 487 U.S. at 994). In keeping\nwith this obligation, we have required that “Plaintiffs make [some] effort to isolate any\n. . . [allegedly adverse] practices [and] to examine their individual effects on the\npromotions process.” Ibid. Our sister circuits have done the same. See, e.g., McClain\nv. Lufkin Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"59430\"><a href=\"/opinion/59430/mcclain-v-lufkin-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275–78 (5th Cir. 2008) (noting that plaintiff must\n“demonstrate that each particular challenged employment practice causes a disparate\nimpact,” and upholding use of subjective decision-making as specific employment\npractice); E.E.O.C. v. Joe’s Stone Crab, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74806\"><a href=\"/opinion/74806/eeoc-v-joes-stone-crabs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1279 (11th Cir. 2000)\n(holding that subjective interview could trigger Title VII disparate-impact liability, but\nholding that liability was not appropriate because no showing of causation).\n\n       Thus, Davis did not identify a “particular employment practice” within the\nmeaning of Title VII by pointing to all of the subjective elements in the Meticulous\nHiring System. She could still survive summary judgment, however, if she showed that\nthe Meticulous Hiring System’s many steps were so intertwined that they were not\ncapable of separation for analysis. As the district court noted, though, Davis did not\nexplain why the well-defined, discrete elements of the Meticulous Hiring System are\n“not capable of separation for analysis.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(B)(i). Indeed, not\nall of the system’s subjective elements are the same. Each different interview, for\ninstance, has a specific interview guide, and different managers conduct interviews at\ndifferent stages of the process.\n\n       Of course, as Davis pointed out at oral argument, the same small group of\nmanagers does conduct all of Location 447’s interviews. And surely, Davis might urge,\nif the statistical data indicate that those managers have gender biases, their exercising\ndiscretion at different steps of the Meticulous Hiring Process should not insulate Cintas\nfrom disparate-impact liability.\n\n       This may be so, but the simple fact remains: Davis did not isolate the specific\npractices that caused the disparate impact she alleges; nor did she show that the\n\fNo. 10-1662         Davis v. Cintas Corp.                                       Page 30\n\n\nmanagers’ various exercises of discretion in the Meticulous Hiring System were\nincapable of separation for analysis. Davis’s disparate impact claims for both 2003 and\n2004, therefore, fail.\n\n                                            IV\n\n        This case presents a number of complex legal and factual issues. In sum, we\n(1) AFFIRM the denial of class certification; (2) REVERSE the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on Davis’s 2003 disparate-treatment claim; and (3) AFFIRM the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment on Davis’s 2004 disparate-treatment claim\nand both of her disparate-impact claims. We remand to the district court for proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
