SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n\n     Bruce Webster challenges his conviction of, and sentence for,\n\nkidnaping resulting in death, conspiring to kidnap, and using and\n\ncarrying a firearm during a crime of violence.               We affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n     The   facts   are     the     same    as   in    the   case   of   Webster’s\n\nco-conspirator, Orlando Hall.         See United States v. Hall, 152 F.3d\n\n381 (5th Cir. 1998).        Webster, Hall, and Marvin Holloway ran a\n\fmarihuana trafficking enterprise in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.               They\n\npurchased marihuana in varying amounts in the Dallas/Fort Worth\n\narea with the assistance of Steven Beckley, who lived in Irving,\n\nTexas.     The marihuana was transported, typically by Beckley, to\n\nArkansas and stored in Holloway's house.\n\n     On September 21, 1994, Holloway drove Hall from Pine Bluff to\n\nthe airport in Little Rock, and Hall took a flight to Dallas to\n\nengage    in    a   drug   transaction.   Beckley   and   Hall's    brother,\n\nDemetrius Hall (D. Hall), picked up Hall at the airport.               Later\n\nthat day, Hall and Beckley met two local drug dealers, Stanfield\n\nVitalis and Neil Rene (N. Rene), at a car wash and gave them $4700\n\nfor the purchase of marihuana.       Later that day, Beckley and D. Hall\n\nreturned to the car wash to pick up the marihuana, but Vitalis and\n\nN. Rene never appeared.\n\n     When Hall got in touch with Vitalis and N. Rene by telephone,\n\nthey claimed they had been robbed of the $4700.                    Using the\n\ntelephone number that Beckley had dialed to contact Vitalis and\n\nN. Rene, Hall procured an address at the Polo Run Apartments in\n\nArlington, Texas, from a friend who worked for the telephone\n\ncompany.       Hall, D. Hall, and Beckley began conducting surveillance\n\nat the address and saw Vitalis and N. Rene exit an apartment and\n\napproach the same car they had driven to the car wash, which they\n\nclaimed was stolen from them along with the $4700.         Hall therefore\n\ndeduced that Vitalis and N. Rene had lied to him about having been\n\nrobbed.\n\n                                      2\n\f     On September 24, Hall contacted Holloway and had him drive\n\nWebster to the Little Rock airport.    From there, Webster flew to\n\nDallas. That evening, Hall, D. Hall, Beckley, and Webster returned\n\nto the Polo Run Apartments in a Cadillac owned by Cassandra Ross,\n\nHall's sister.   Hall and Webster were armed with handguns, D. Hall\n\ncarried a small souvenir baseball bat, and Beckley had duct tape\n\nand a jug of gasoline.    They approached the apartment from which\n\nthey had previously seen Vitalis and N. Rene leave.\n\n     Webster and D. Hall went to the front door and knocked.   The\n\noccupant, Lisa Rene, N. Rene’s sixteen-year-old sister, refused to\n\nlet them in and called her sister and the police emergency phone\n\nnumber.   After Webster unsuccessfully attempted to kick in the\n\ndoor, he and D. Hall looked through a sliding glass door on the\n\npatio and saw that Lisa Rene was on the telephone.         D. Hall\n\nshattered the door with the bat; Webster entered the apartment,\n\ntackled Lisa Rene, and dragged her to the car.\n\n     Hall and Beckley had returned to the car when they heard the\n\nsound of breaking glass.       Webster forced Lisa Rene onto the\n\nfloorboard of the car, and the group drove to Ross’s apartment in\n\nIrving.   Once there, they exited the Cadillac and forced Lisa Rene\n\ninto the back seat of Beckley’s car; Hall climbed into the back\n\nseat as well.    With Beckley at the wheel and Webster in the front\n\npassenger seat, they drove around looking for a secluded spot.\n\nDuring the drive, Hall raped Lisa Rene and forced her to perform\n\nfellatio on him.\n\n                                  3\n\f     Unable   to   find   a   spot   to    their   liking,   they   eventually\n\nreturned to Ross’s apartment.         From there, Beckley, D. Hall, and\n\nWebster drove Lisa Rene to Pine Bluff.         Hall remained in Irving and\n\nflew back to Arkansas the next day.                En route to Pine Bluff,\n\nWebster and D. Hall took turns raping Lisa Rene.               Once Beckley,\n\nD. Hall and Webster reached Pine Bluff, they obtained money from\n\nHolloway to get a motel room.        In the room, they tied Lisa Rene to\n\na chair and raped her repeatedly.\n\n     Hall and Holloway arrived at the motel room on the morning of\n\nSeptember 25.      They went into the bathroom with Lisa Rene for\n\napproximately fifteen to twenty minutes.             When Hall and Holloway\n\ncame out of the bathroom, Hall told Beckley, \"She know too much.\"\n\nHall, Holloway, and Webster then left the motel.\n\n     Later that afternoon, Webster and Hall went to Byrd Lake Park\n\nand dug a grave.     That same evening, Webster, Hall, and Beckley\n\ntook Lisa Rene to the park but could not find the grave site in the\n\ndark, so they returned to the motel room.           In the early morning of\n\nSeptember 26, Beckley and D. Hall moved Lisa Rene to another motel\n\nbecause they believed the security guard at the first motel was\n\ngrowing suspicious.\n\n     The same morning, Webster, Hall, and Beckley again drove Lisa\n\nRene to Byrd Lake Park.       They covered her eyes with a mask.         Hall\n\nand Webster led the way to the grave site, with Beckley guiding\n\nLisa Rene by the shoulders.          At the grave site, Hall turned Lisa\n\nRene’s back toward the grave, placed a sheet over her head, and hit\n\n                                       4\n\fher in the head with a shovel.       Lisa Rene screamed and started\n\nrunning.   Beckley grabbed her, and they both fell down.    Beckley\n\nhit her in the head twice with the shovel and handed it to Hall.\n\nWebster and Hall began taking turns hitting her with the shovel.\n\nWebster then gagged her and dragged her into the grave.          He\n\nstripped her, covered her with gasoline, and shoveled dirt back\n\ninto the grave.    When buried, Lisa Rene, although unconscious,\n\nlikely was still breathing.      Hall, Beckley, and Webster then\n\nreturned to the motel and picked up D. Hall.\n\n     Based on information from the victim’s brothers, D. Hall was\n\narrested; Hall and Beckley subsequently surrendered to the police.\n\nOn September 29, just after turning himself in, Beckley gave a\n\nconfession to a police detective and an FBI agent in which he\n\nadmitted to the kidnaping of Lisa Rene and implicated himself,\n\nHall, and an individual known as “B-Love.”   Beckley stated that he\n\nhad last seen Lisa Rene at the Pine Bluff Motel with B-Love.      A\n\nsecurity guard at the motel informed the agents and officers that\n\nWebster went by the name B-Love, and provided a description of\n\nWebster and his vehicle.     When Webster pulled into the motel\n\nparking lot during the early morning of September 30, he was\n\ndetained and subsequently arrested.\n\n\n\n                               II.\n\n     In November 1994, a six-count superseding indictment charged\n\nWebster, Hall, D. Hall, Beckley, and Holloway with various offenses\n\n                                 5\n\frelated to the kidnaping and murder of Lisa Rene.              Specifically,\n\nthe indictment charged Webster with kidnaping in which a death\n\noccurred   in   violation    of   18   U.S.C.   §   1201(a)(1)   (count    1),\n\nconspiracy to commit kidnaping in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1201(c)\n\n(count 2), traveling in interstate commerce with intent to promote\n\nextortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (count 5), and using and\n\ncarrying a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (count 6).          In February 1995, the government\n\nfiled its notice of intent to seek the death penalty against\n\nWebster pursuant to § 3593(a) of the Federal Death Penalty Act of\n\n1994 (“FDPA”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3591-3598.\n\n      Webster’s trial was severed from that of his co-defendants.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6, and\n\ncount five was dismissed on the government’s motion.               The court\n\nconducted a separate sentencing hearing before the same jury.              See\n\n§ 3593.      After the penalty phase, the jury returned special\n\nfindings that Webster satisfied the requisite elements of intent,\n\nsee § 3591(a), and that three statutory and two non-statutory\n\naggravating factors existed.1          See § 3592.      Varying numbers of\n\n      1\n        The jury unanimously found all but the first of the following statutory\naggravating factors:\n\n      II(A).      The defendant, Bruce Carneil Webster, caused the death\n      of Lisa Rene, or injury resulting in death of Lisa Rene, which\n      occurred during the commission of the offense of kidnapping.\n\n      II(B).      The defendant . . . committed the offense in an\n      especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner in that it involved\n      torture or serious physical abuse of Lisa Rene.\n                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                       6\n\fjurors found nine mitigating factors.2             See § 3592.      The court\n\n\n      1\n       (...continued)\n      II(C).      The defendant . . ., after substantial planning and\n      premeditation, committed the offense of kidnapping in which the\n      death of Lisa Rene resulted.\n\n      II(D).      The victim, Lisa Rene, was particularly vulnerable due\n      to her age.\n\nIn addition, the jury unanimously found both of the proposed non-statutory\naggravating factors:\n\n      III(A).     The defendant . . . constitutes a future danger to the\n      lives and safety of other persons.\n\n      III(B).     The effect of the instant offense on Lisa Rene’s family.\n      2\n        Webster proposed the following statutory mitigating factors (with the\nnumber of jurors finding each mitigating factor shown in brackets):\n\n      1.    The defendant’s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his\n            conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the\n            law was significantly impaired. [0]\n\n      2.    The defendant was under unusual and substantial duress. [0]\n\n      3.    Another defendant or defendants, equally culpable in the\n            crime, will not be punished by death. [4]\n\n      4.    The defendant does not have a significant prior history of\n            other criminal conduct. [0]\n\n      5.    The defendant committed the offense under severe mental or\n            emotional disturbance. [0]\n\n      Webster proposed the following non-statutory mitigating factors (with the\nnumber of jurors finding each mitigating factor shown in brackets):\n\n      1.    The defendant is or may be mentally retarded. [4]\n\n      2.    The defendant has low intellectual functioning. [4]\n\n      3.    The defendant suffered from physical abuse, from emotional\n            abuse, and/or from parental neglect during his upbringing.\n            [12]\n\n      4.    The defendant, as a result of a personality disorder, a mental\n            illness, and/or low intellectual functioning, has a lesser\n            capability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\n            conform his conduct to the requirements of the law than that\n            of a normal person. [0]\n\n      5.    The defendant was youthful at the time of the commission of\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                       7\n\fsentenced   Webster    to   death   on     count   one   of   the   superseding\n\nindictment; life imprisonment on count two; and sixty months'\n\nimprisonment on count six to run consecutively to the sentence in\n\ncount 2.\n\n\n\n                                     III.\n\n     Webster raises several grounds for reversing his conviction\n\n     2\n      (...continued)\n            the crime, although not under the age of eighteen. [0]\n\n     6.     The defendant has talents, capabilities, or qualities which\n            are of some value to society (such as musical talent,\n            religious devotion, etc.). [0]\n\n     7.     The defendant is unduly susceptible to influence by others. [0]\n\n     8.     The defendant’s level of participation in the commission of\n            this offense was attributable, at least in part, to the\n            influence of one or more of the other participants involved in\n            the commission of this crime. [4]\n\n     9.     The defendant grew up in an atmosphere of violence and fear,\n            which has misshaped his perception as to the acceptability or\n            necessity of violent conduct. [6]\n\n     10.    The defendant can be controlled in a prison setting. [2]\n\n     11.    The defendant can be of some productive value in a prison\n            setting. [0]\n\n     12.    The defendant has the love and support of other members of his\n            family. [11]\n\n     13.    The defendant does not have a significant prior history of\n            violent crime. [0]\n\n     14.    The defendant is the product of an impoverished background\n            which virtually precluded his integration into the social and\n            economic mainstream of the community. [0]\n\n     15.    The defendant has responded well to structured environments\n            and would likely adapt to prison life if he were sentenced to\n            life imprisonment. [2]\n\n     16.    Any other factor or factors in the defendant’s background,\n            record, or character or any other circumstance of the offense\n            that mitigates against imposition of the death sentence. [0]\n\n                                       8\n\fand/or sentence that we already have ruled on in Hall:\n\n      1.   The district court violated Webster’s Fifth and\n      Eighth Amendment rights by conditioning the admission of\n      psychiatric testimony in mitigation of punishment upon\n      Webster’s submission to a government psychiatric\n      examination.3\n\n      2. The district court abused its discretion by admitting\n      certain unfairly prejudicial materials into evidence,\n      namely photographs and a videotape.4\n\n      3.  The admission of evidence regarding unadjudicated\n      offenses5 during the penalty phase and a lack of a jury\n\n\n      3\n        Webster raises an additional Fifth Amendment argument relating to his\ncompelled examination, not addressed in Hall, with which we deal infra.\n      4\n         Webster attempts to parlay his evidentiary objection into a\nconstitutional claim; having upheld the evidence’s admissibility as an\nevidentiary matter, we cannot conclude that its admission nonetheless violated\nhis constitutional rights.\n\n      5\n          Webster specifically complains about the following evidence:\n\n      •       the oral statement “If I was out now, I’d kill the bitch” that\n              gave him a venereal disease.\n\n      •       the oral statement that killing Lisa Rene wasn’t personal, “it\n              was strictly business.”\n\n      •       an escape attempt where he entered an unauthorized area (the\n              women’s shower) of the Mansfield jail.\n\n      •       the sexual rendezvous with female inmates planned with fellow\n              inmate John Clay.\n\n      •       the alleged shooting at a store owner after an attempted\n              theft.\n\n      •       the assault of Sheila Henry, a girlfriend.\n\n      •       a shoving match over a piece of candy.\n\nWebster also argues these should have been excluded because of the need for\nsufficient reliability of evidence in capital proceedings. See Caldwell v.\nMississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 340 (1985).\n\n      We find ample support in the record of the evidence’s reliability, which\njustifies putting it before the jury. First, it was testimony based on first-\nhand observations; Webster had the opportunity to confront and challenge each of\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                         9\n\f      instruction requiring the jury to apply some burden of\n      proof to this evidence rendered the death sentence\n      unreliable.\n\n      4.    The admission of nontestimonial victim impact\n      statements violated due process and the Eighth Amendment,\n      Webster’s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, and the\n      FDPA’s evidentiary standards.\n\nWe addressed and rejected each of these arguments in Hall, which\n                                 6\ncontrols the outcome here.\n\n\n\n                                      IV.\n\n      Webster appeals his judgment of conviction and death sentence\n\non the following grounds that we must address, as we did not\n\nconsider them in Hall:\n\n      1.   The court erroneously instructed and materially\n      misdirected the jury in numerous ways at the penalty\n      phase.\n\n      2.   The court failed to instruct the jury accurately\n      regarding on which non-monetary benefit(s) of the\n      kidnapping the government relied and regarding the need\n      for the jury to agree on such a benefit unanimously in\n      order to convict in the guilt-innocence phase.\n\n      3. The court admitted the fruits of a search pursuant\n      to, and statements given after, an arrest contravening\n\n\n      5\n       (...continued)\nthe witnesses.    Second, because Webster was given advance notice that the\ngovernment would be introducing evidence of unadjudicated offenses, he had the\nopportunity independently to investigate and respond to the evidence. Third, the\ngovernment introduced corroborating evidence for several of the incidents.\nFourth, the statements of which Webster complains were not related to\nunadjudicated offenses; rather, they were statements made to law enforcement\nofficers after his arrest. Finally, Webster provides no reason why we should be\nreticent to believe any of the testimony or that the incidents occurred.\n      6\n        See Hall, 152 F.3d at 398 (compelled psychiatric exam), id. at 400-03\n(evidentiary rulings on photographs and videotape), id. at 403-04 (unadjudicated\noffenses), id. at 404-06 (nontestimonial victim impact statements).\n\n                                      10\n\fthe Fourth Amendment.\n\n4.    The court erred by refusing to dismiss the\ngovernment’s notice to seek the death penalty based on\nallegations of racial discrimination in death penalty\ncharging decisions and by refusing Webster’s request for\ndiscovery on that claim.\n\n5. The court abused its discretion by refusing Webster’s\nmotion for post-trial discovery on a claim that the\ngovernment had provided sexual favors to a prisoner-\nwitness.\n\n6.   The court lacked authority to order Webster to\nundergo a government psychiatric exam as a condition to\nadmitting psychiatric testimony in mitigation of\npunishment.\n\n7.   The court abused its discretion in granting the\ngovernment’s Witt challenge to a venireman.\n\n8. The court’s rejection of defense challenges for cause\nto impaired and biased veniremen denied Webster an\nimpartial jury and his statutory right to free exercise\nof peremptory challenges.\n\n9. The court erred in excusing a venireman whose juror\nquestionnaire contained false information.\n\n10. The court clearly erred in denying Webster’s Batson\nclaims.\n\n11. The court erred by impaneling an alternate juror\nduring the penalty phase who did not deliberate during\nthe guilt-innocence phase.\n\n12. The court violated Webster’s constitutional rights\nand abused its discretion by limiting surrebuttal.\n\n13.   The court plainly erred and violated Webster’s\nconstitutional rights by entering a factual finding that\nhe is not mentally retarded.\n\n14.   There is insufficient evidence to support the\nsentence of death.\n\n15. Certain provisions of the FDPA are unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n                          11\n\f      16.   The court sua sponte should have suppressed the\n      testimony of Webster’s co-conspirators, who testified in\n      exchange for leniency.\n\nWe address each of these issues in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                        A.\n\n      Webster contends that the district court erroneously in-\n\nstructed and materially misdirected the jury at the penalty phase.\n\nDistrict courts enjoy substantial latitude in formulating a jury\n\ncharge, and hence we review all challenges to, and refusals to\n\ngive, jury instructions for abuse of discretion.7\n\n      A conviction will not be reversed for an alleged error in the\n\ninstructions unless, when viewed in their entirety, they fail\n\ncorrectly to state the law.

A refusal to\n\ngive a requested instruction constitutes reversible error only if\n\nthe proposed instruction (1) is substantially correct, (2) is not\n\nsubstantively covered in the jury charge, and (3) pertains to an\n\nimportant    issue    in   the   trial,    such   that    failure    to   give   it\n\n\n      7\n        United States v.

The argument is\n\nwithout merit.\n\n\n\n                                    a.\n\n     Webster’s reasoning hinges on Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782\n\n(1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987).             He contends\n\nthat these cases require a two-pronged focus in the decision-making\n\nprocess to impose a death sentence: the defendant’s participation\n\n(conduct) and his intent (state of mind).             It follows, Webster\n\nbelieves,   that   the   court   should   have   instructed   the   jury    to\n\nconsider only his conduct in assessing the aggravating factors.\n\n\n\n                                    b.\n\n     Webster misreads Enmund and Tison.          In those cases, the Court\n\naddressed the degree of culpability required of a defendant to\n\nimpose a death sentence under the felony-murder doctrine.                  The\n\n\n                                    13\n\fCourt did require a certain level of culpable conduct and state of\n\nmind.     See Enmund, 458 U.S. at 801; Tison, 481 U.S. at 158.    But\n\nWebster takes the requirement too far.\n\n     The point of Tison and Enmund is that a death sentence may not\n\nbe imposed unless the sentencer has examined the defendant’s “own\n\npersonal involvement in the crimes.”         Tison, 481 U.S. at 158.\n\nEnmund escaped capital punishment because he “did not kill or\n\nattempt to kill,” nor did he have “any intention of participating\n\nin or facilitating a murder.”          Enmund, 458 U.S. at 798.   The\n\nTisons, on the other hand, failed to obtain a reversal, because\n\nthey were sufficiently involved in the crimes.     See Tison, 481 U.S.\n\nat 158.\n\n     The gist of these cases is that before a death sentence may be\n\nrecommended, the Eighth Amendment requires that the defendant, for\n\nexample, killed, inflicted serious bodily injury resulting in\n\ndeath, or participated in a felony with reckless disregard for\n\nhuman life resulting in death.   The FDPA meets this requirement in\n\n§ 3591, by limiting even the possibility of a death sentence to\n\nthose defendants with sufficient culpability.         The jury found\n\nWebster guilty of “engaging in conduct intending death to result or\n\nthat lethal force would be used” and of “engaging in conduct\n\nknowing that it created grave risk of death.”\n\n     Once the constitutionally-required minimum level of culpabil-\n\nity is found, however, there is no reason why the jury cannot take\n\n\n                                  14\n\fa broader look at the crime in assessing the aggravating factors;\n\nit need not limit itself exclusively to the defendant’s conduct or\n\nintent.     Indeed, an aggravating factor properly may focus on the\n\ndefendant,     on    the   circumstances      of   the   crime     itself,   or   on\n\ncharacteristics of the victim.8\n\n\n\n\n                                        c.\n\n       Furthermore, one of the FDPA’s aggravating factors requires a\n\njury to examine a factor that has nothing to do with the defen-\n\ndant’s     conduct    or   intentSSthe       victim’s    vulnerability.           See\n\n§ 3592(c)(11); cf. Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 977.                      The government\n\nalleged that Lisa Rene’s young age rendered her particularly\n\nvulnerable, hence constituting an aggravating factor.                 Because the\n\nfactor has nothing to do with Webster’s conduct or intent, his\n\nproffered general instruction would have incorrectly stated the\n\nlaw.\n\n       In addition, the charge as a whole substantially covered the\n\nproffered     instruction     and    sufficiently        pointed    the   jury     to\n\nWebster’s conduct and intent.            The court instructed that “[i]n\n\nconsidering the question of intent, as it related to aggravating\n\n\n\n       8\n        See Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U.S. 967, 976 (1994) (holding that “[t]he\ncircumstances of the crime are a traditional subject for consideration by the\nsentencer,” and may include factors such as the defendant's age); Roberts v.\nLouisiana, 431 U.S. 633, 636 (1997) (holding that a murder victim’s status as peace\nofficer performing regular duties constitutes permissible aggravating factor).\n\n                                        15\n\ffactors, you may consider only the intent of the defendant, Bruce\n\nCarneil Webster.”      The aggravating factors, other than the victim\n\nvulnerability factor, all pointed to Webster’s conduct.                      The\n\ninstructions     explaining     the    factors    repeatedly     referred     to\n\nWebster's conduct and intent.9          The non-statutory factor Webster\n\nspecifically attacks, “the effect of the offense on Lisa Rene and\n\nher family,” focuses on the harm caused by Webster’s “commission of\n\nthe offense.”     The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing\n\nthis instruction; including it would have misstated the law.\n\n\n\n                                       2.\n\n      Webster    objects   to   the   instruction     on   the   “elements    of\n\nintent.”    He argues that the court failed to require the jury to\n\nselect a single element of intent, and to do so unanimously.                This\n\nfailure allegedly allowed the jury impermissibly to “double-weigh”\n\na single factorSSintentSSin imposing the death penalty, skewing the\n\nprocess toward capital punishment.\n\n      Although Webster rightly points out the risk of unconstitu-\n\ntionally arbitrary application of the death penalty if the jury is\n\npermitted to double-count aggravating factors, see Jones, 132 F.3d\n\nat 250-51, the court did not err in this regard.             The instructions\n\n\n\n      9\n        The court's examples included the following: “'Cruel' means that the\ndefendant intended to inflict a high degree of pain . . .,” “'[d]epraved' means\nthat the defendant relished the killing or showed indifference . . .,” and “[t]he\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the\noffense after substantial planning and premeditation.”\n\n                                       16\n\fon    the   elements   of   intent    properly    followed      the    language    of\n\n§ 3591(a)(2).        They stated that the jury’s findings as to the\n\n“elements of intent” had to be unanimous.10                If any doubt remained,\n\nthe special findings form that the jury filled out prominently\n\ndisplayed the word “unanimously” before the “yes” and “no” lines to\n\nbe checked for each of the four elements.\n\n       In addition, the instructions accurately charged that the jury\n\nwas not to weigh the elements of intent in deciding whether to\n\nimpose the death penalty.           At least one of the elements of intent\n\nneeds to be found only as a threshold, or gateway, matter; and only\n\nonce at least one is found does the weighing of aggravating factors\n\nand mitigating factors take placeSSwith no further consideration of\n\nthe “elements of intent.”\n\n       The instructions walked the jury through this sequential\n\nprocess.     The court instructed the jury first to determine whether\n\none    of   the    requisite   elements   of    intent      existed.      Then    the\n\ninstructions set forth the aggravating and mitigating factors.\n\n       The instructions nowhere indicated that the jury was to\n\nconsider     the    elements   of    intent    once   it    began   to   weigh    the\n\naggravating and mitigating factors. In fact, the jury specifically\n\nwas instructed to weigh aggravating and mitigating factors with no\n\n\n\n       10\n          The court instructed that “you must as a preliminary matter unanimously\nagree that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n. . . either . . .,” followed by a list of the four possible intents, and “if you\nunanimously find . . .” one or more of the elements of intent, the jury was to\nconsider aggravating factors.\n\n                                        17\n\fmention of the elements of intent.             The special jury form also\n\nsegregated the elements of intent from the lists of aggravating and\n\nmitigating factors, and made clear the sequential nature of the\n\nprocess.\n\n     Finally,      the   court    specifically    instructed    the    jury    to\n\nconsider and weigh only the aggravating and mitigating factors\n\noutlined in the instructions, which did not include the elements of\n\nintent.    Assuming, as we must, that the jury followed its instruc-\n\ntions, it did not weigh the elements of intent even once.                     The\n\ncourt did    not    abuse   its   discretion     in   denying   the   proffered\n\ninstruction.\n\n\n\n                                       3.\n\n                                       a.\n\n     In a similar vein, Webster argues that two of the aggravating\n\nfactors overlapped, allowing the jury to weigh the same factor\n\ntwice.     Specifically, one statutory factor read: “the defendant\n\ncommitted the offense in an especially heinous, cruel and depraved\n\nmanner in that it involved torture and serious physical abuse to\n\nthe victim, Lisa Rene.”          One non-statutory factor addressed “the\n\neffect of the offense on Lisa Rene and her family, namely, that the\n\ncommission of the offense caused emotional injury and anguish to\n\nLisa Rene, and emotional injury, anguish, sorrow, and loss to her\n\nfamily.”     Webster contends that these aggravating factors are\n\nduplicative because “there is no effective distinction between\n\n                                       18\n\finfliction of 'severe mental and physical pain or suffering upon\n\nthe victim' (authorized by the court’s instructions for a finding\n\non the statutory aggravating factor) and the 'emotional injury and\n\nanguish to Lisa Rene' focused upon in the 'non-statutory' aggravat-\n\ning factor.”\n\n     Webster points out that the charge allowed the jury to find\n\nthat the statutory factor existed based on a finding of “torture,”\n\ndefined to include “mental as well as physical abuse” and the\n\nintent to “inflict severe mental or physical pain or suffering upon\n\nthe victim,” of which the victim must be conscious.        Webster\n\nalleges that there is no distinction between the statutory factor’s\n\n“severe mental or physical pain or suffering” and the non-statutory\n\nfactor’s “emotional injury and anguish.”\n\n\n\n                                b.\n\n     Webster failed to object to these instructions, so we review\n\nfor plain error.   See Jones, 132 F.3d at 243.   The court did not\n\nerr in instructing on both factors because, although they may rely\n\non similar underlying facts, they focus on different aspects of the\n\ncrime and its results.\n\n     The statutory factor directs the jury to consider whether\n\nWebster committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, and\n\ndepraved manner, hence focusing attention on his actions and\n\nintent. The non-statutory victim impact factor, on the other hand,\n\n\n\n                                19\n\fdirects the jury’s attention to the harm caused by Webster to the\n\nvictim and her family.        This factor looks not to his actions but to\n\ntheir result.        Because one factor addresses directly Webster's\n\nconduct and intent (the “manner” of commission), and the other the\n\nimpact   of   that    conduct   and    intent,   the   two   factors    are   not\n\nduplicative.\n\n       Webster’s reliance on Jones proves unavailing.             In Jones, we\n\nfound two non-statutory aggravating factors duplicative.                      One\n\naddressed     the    victim’s   “young    age,   her   slight    stature,     her\n\nbackground, and her unfamiliarity with [the locale where the crime\n\ntook   place],”      and   another    dealt   with   the   victim’s    “personal\n\ncharacteristics” and the impact of the crime.              We held the factors\n\nduplicative because “'personal characteristics' . . . necessarily\n\nincludes 'young age, slight stature, background, and unfamiliar-\n\nity.'”    Id. at 250.\n\n       But the difference between the challenged factors in the case\n\nsub judice proves to be more than semantic.                The “heinous, cruel\n\nand depraved” manner in which a crime is carried out, even though\n\nthe instructions require that the victim is conscious of the\n\nemotional abuse, does not necessarily include, nor even overlap\n\nwith, consideration of the effects of the crime on the victim and\n\nher family.         The court did not plainly err in providing both\n\ninstructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f                                      4.\n\n                                      a.\n\n      Webster argues, and the government concedes, that, by allowing\n\nthe jury to consider premeditation with respect to the kidnaping\n\nand not just the murder, the court improperly charged the jury on\n\nthe statutory aggravating factor of whether Webster engaged in\n\n“substantial planning and premeditation” of the offense.11                  The\n\nspecial    findings    form   also    contained    language    relating     the\n\npremeditation to the kidnaping rather than to causing death.                The\n\nstatute requires a finding that “the defendant committed the\n\noffense after substantial planning and premeditation to cause the\n\ndeath of a person,” § 3592(c)(9), obviously directing the premedi-\n\ntation to causing death and not to mere commission of the offense\n\nwhen the two diverge. The parties disagree, however, as to whether\n\nthis constitutes reversible error.          We find it does not.\n\n\n\n                                      b.\n\n      The government argues that Webster invited the erroneous\n\ninstruction and now should not be heard to complain.               See United\n\nStates v. Baytank (Houston), Inc., 934 F.2d 599, 606 (5th Cir.\n\n1991).    Although Webster’s requested jury instruction properly\n\n\n      11\n         The court charged that “[t]o establish the existence of the aggravating\nfactor of substantial planning and premeditation, the government must prove\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the offense after\nsubstantial planning and premeditation . . . . The amount of time needed for\npremeditation of a kidnapping in which a death occurs depends on the person and\nthe circumstance.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n                                      21\n\ffocused on substantial planning and premeditation for the murder,\n\nthe government points to his proposed changes to the special\n\nfindings form in which Webster proposed the following language:\n\n“Beyond a reasonable doubt and looking only to the conduct and\n\nintentions of the defendant, Bruce Carneil Webster, he, Bruce\n\nCarneil Webster, committed the killing of Lisa Rene after substan-\n\ntial planning and premeditation to commit the kidnaping of Lisa\n\nRene.”   The   government   surmises   that   the   court   adopted   this\n\nlanguage in formulating the instructions and special issue.\n\n     Although it is possible that Webster’s misstatement influenced\n\nthe instructions, Webster also proffered instructions correctly\n\napplying the substantial planning and premeditation to the killing\n\nrather than to the kidnaping.    Given the inconstant way in which\n\nWebster addressed the issue, we cannot conclude he invited the\n\nerror.\n\n\n\n                                 c.\n\n     The error notwithstanding, we affirm the sentence.         The FDPA\n\nprovides that a “court of appeals shall not reverse or vacate a\n\nsentence of death on account of any error which can be harmless,\n\nincluding any erroneous special finding of an aggravating factor,\n\nwhere the Government establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nerror was harmless.”   § 3595(c)(2)(C).\n\n     Our duty when the jury finds an invalid aggravating factor is\n\nto strike the factor and either reweigh the remaining factors\n\n                                 22\n\fagainst the mitigating evidence or apply harmless error review.\n\nSee Jones, 132 F.3d at 251; see also Clemons v. Mississippi,\n\n494 U.S. 738, 741 (1990).   If we choose to reweigh the evidence, we\n\nmust determine what the jury would have done absent the invalid\n\naggravator.   See Jones, 132 F.3d at 251.\n\n     In conducting a harmless error review, on the other hand, we\n\nmay inquire into whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, either (1) the\n\ndeath sentence would have been imposed had the invalid aggravating\n\nfactor been properly defined in the jury instructions or (2) the\n\ndeath sentence would have been imposed absent the invalid aggravat-\n\ning factor.   See id. at 252.   If the government establishes that\n\nthe error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we may not reverse\n\nor vacate the death sentence unless such error denies constitu-\n\ntional rights.   See § 3595.     We may decide which of the three\n\nmethods to apply, although “[i]t matters not which standard of\n\nreview an appellate court chooses to apply because all three\n\nstandards lead to the same conclusion.”     Jones, 132 F.3d at 252.\n\n     The parties expend a great deal of effort arguing whether the\n\njury would have found the factor had it been accurately stated.\n\nThe effort is wasted, however, because the sentence may be affirmed\n\nwithout that aggravating factor. We opt to apply the second method\n\nof harmless error review, and inquire into whether the sentence\n\n\n\n\n                                 23\n\fwould have been imposed absent the invalid aggravator.12\n\n      After removing the offensive statutory aggravating factor, we\n\nare left with two statutory factors (that Webster committed the\n\noffense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, and\n\nthat Lisa Rene was vulnerable), two non-statutory aggravating\n\nfactors (Webster’s future danger to others, and the effect of the\n\ncrime on Lisa Rene’s family), and nine mitigating factors found to\n\nexist by varying numbers of jurors.          The government contends, and\n\nwe agree, that the facts supporting the “especially heinous, cruel\n\nor   depraved”    factor   alone,    when   weighed    against    the   extant\n\nmitigating factors, justify a finding that the jury still would\n\nhave imposed a death sentence.          The addition of the other three\n\nfactors merely buttresses the conclusion.13\n\n      Furthermore, we fail to see why the jury would have placed\n\nmuch emphasis on the invalid factor as it was improperly defined\n\nand charged.     The import of substantial planning and premeditation\n\nto commit the offense of kidnaping pales in comparison to the\n\nbrutal nature of Webster’s actions and the suffering Lisa Rene must\n\nhave felt as a result, so we do not think the jury would have\n\nplaced significant weight on the invalid factor relative to the\n\n\n      12\n         We also find that the government has established beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the jury would have found the aggravating factor if the instructions\nproperly had charged the jury on it; thus we can affirm under the first harmless\nerror review, as well.\n      13\n        Webster asserts that we should give the aggravating factor dealing with\nvictim vulnerability little weight because the Hall jury did not find it. But\nWebster’s jury did, and we refuse to question that determination.\n\n                                      24\n\fothers.\n\n     Finally, the paltry mitigating factors that the jury found\n\nfail to indicate that it placed much weight on countervailing\n\nfactors. No juror found that Webster had talents, capabilities, or\n\nqualities of some value to society or that he could be of some\n\nproductive value in a prison setting.           Only two jurors believed\n\nthat he even could be controlled in a prison setting, and only two\n\nfound he likely would adapt to prison.           The jury found only one\n\nfactor unanimously:       Webster suffered from physical or emotional\n\nabuse or parental neglect during his upbringing; and yet no juror\n\nbelieved that this abuse caused significant impairment of Webster’s\n\nability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform\n\nhis conduct to the requirements of the law.            The government has\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have imposed\n\nthe death sentence absent the invalid aggravating factor, so its\n\ninclusion was harmless error.14\n\n\n\n                                      5.\n\n     Webster contends that the court erred when it refused to\n\nsubmit several nonstatutory mitigating factors.15           Just this past\n\n\n     14\n         We see no reason why the inclusion of the invalid factor rises to the\nlevel of a denial of constitutional rights that would require vacating the\nsentence.\n     15\n          The rejected factors are:\n\n     8.

Angelone, 118 S. Ct. 757, 761 (1998),\n\nthe    Court squarely held that, although “the sentencer may not be\n\nprecluded from considering, and may not refuse to consider, any\n\nconstitutionally relevant mitigating evidence,” a death penalty\n\nscheme       “may   shape    and   structure    the   jury’s   consideration   of\n\nmitigation so long as it does not preclude the jury from giving\n\neffect to any relevant mitigating evidence.”                   The Court further\n\nexplained that its “decisions suggest complete jury discretion is\n\nconstitutionally permissible.”            Id.\n\n       The standard for reviewing jury instructions on mitigation is\n\n“whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied\n\nthe challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration\n\nof    constitutionally        relevant   evidence.”       Id.    (quotation    and\n\ncitation omitted).           Indeed, in Buchanan, refusing to submit four\n\nstatutory mitigating factors             during the penalty phase of the\n\ncapital trial fell short of constitutional error.\n\n       Many of the mitigating factors presented to the jury touched\n\non the ones Webster complains were omitted.

The charge\n\nspecifically instructed the jury that it “must consider” any other\n\nmitigating factors it found, “whether or not specifically argued by\n\ndefense counsel.”\n\n      The instructions left no room for the jury to ignore constitu-\n\ntionally relevant evidence.          The court neither committed constitu-\n\ntional error nor abused its discretion in rejecting the mitigating\n\nfactors.\n\n\n\n                                        6.\n\n      Webster avers that the instructions misstated the law by not\n\nrequiring, once one or more jurors had found a mitigating factor to\n\nexist by a preponderance of the evidence, that all jurors             consider\n\na   mitigating      factor   in     weighing   aggravating   and   mitigating\n\nfactors.16 Webster misreads the statute; although any one juror may\n\nfind and weigh a mitigating factor, the others may make their own\n\ndeterminations with respect to each mitigator.\n\n\n      16\n           The court charged that\n\n      [a] finding with respect to a mitigating factor may be made by any\n      one or more of the members of the jury, and any member who finds the\n      existence of a mitigating factor may consider such factor\n      established regardless of whether any other jurors agree that such\n      mitigating factor has been established. . . .        In determining\n      whether a sentence of death is appropriate, each of you must weigh\n      in your own mind, any aggravating factor or factors that the jury\n      unanimously finds to exist beyond a reasonable doubt—whether\n      statutory or non-statutory—against any mitigating factor or factors\n      that you individually find to exist by a preponderance of the\n      evidence.\n\n                                        27\n\f       Webster relies on § 3593(e), which reads, in part, “the jury\n\n. . . shall consider whether all the aggravating factor or factors\n\nfound to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor or\n\nfactors found to exist to justify a sentence of death.”              Webster\n\nreads this provision to say that once any juror finds a mitigating\n\nfactor, all jurors must weigh the factor.         But the quoted language\n\ndoes   not   require   Webster’s   reading;     the    provision   lacks   any\n\nmodifier indicating who must find or weigh the mitigating fac-\n\ntor(s).\n\n       Reading the section as a whole, we conclude that Congress did\n\nnot intend Webster’s reading.         The prior subpart states that “[a]\n\nfinding with respect to a mitigating factor may be made by 1 or\n\nmore members of the jury, and any member of the jury who finds the\n\nexistence of a mitigating factor may consider such factor estab-\n\nlished for the purposes of this section regardless of the number of\n\njurors    who   concur   that   the    factor    has    been   established.”\n\n§ 3593(d).      Reading the two sections in pari materia, we reason\n\nthat the language does not contemplate forcing all jurors to\n\nconsider a mitigator when any one or more finds it to exist.\n\nRather, each juror may consider a factor regardless of whether\n\nothers concur.     In addition, it would be nonsensical for Congress\n\nto require a juror to weigh a factor that he or she does not\n\nbelieve the evidence warrants.\n\n       Webster, in an apparent attempt to avoid this last problem,\n\n\n                                      28\n\fargues that “[o]nce a mitigating factor has been established, then\n\nthe sentencer must consider it, even though it may be assigned\n\nwhatever weight it is deemed to deserve.”    But, naturally, those\n\njurors who did not find the mitigating factor to exist would assign\n\nit no weight, which does not differ from the result Webster hopes\n\nto avoid, i.e., not requiring them to consider it at all.   Because\n\nthe plain language of the statute does not compel every juror to\n\nweigh each mitigating factor found by at least one juror, the\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the instruction that\n\nwould have required it.\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n                                1.\n\n     The indictment alleged, inter alia, that Webster and others\n\nviolated 18 U.S.C. § 1201(a), proscribing kidnaping.   Pursuant to\n\nthat indictment, the court charged the jury that to convict, it had\n\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt the element “[t]hat the defendant\n\nheld such person for ransom, reward, or some other benefit that the\n\ndefendant intended to derive from the kidnapping.”       The court\n\nfurther charged that “a benefit is any legal or illegal object of\n\nthe kidnaping which a perpetrator might consider sufficient motive\n\nto induce him to undertake the kidnaping.   The government has the\n\nburden of proving whatever benefit alleged by proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.”\n\n\n                                29\n\f     Webster objects to this instruction on the ground that,\n\nbecause the indictment failed to allege any specific benefit other\n\nthan ransom or reward, the jury should not be able to consider any\n\nother   benefit,   and    because   the    instruction    fails   to   require\n\nunanimity on the benefit found.           The government responds that the\n\nbenefit is not a specific element of the crime, so it need not\n\nallege one in the indictment, nor does one need to be specified in\n\nthe jury instructions; furthermore, unanimity is not required.\n\n\n\n                                     2.\n\n     We review alleged errors in jury instructions for abuse of\n\ndiscretion; a conviction will not be reversed for an alleged error\n\nin the instructions unless, when viewed in their entirety, they\n\nfailed to state the law correctly.          Jones, 132 F.3d at 243.      These\n\ninstructions did not fail to state the law correctly.\n\n\n\n                                     a.\n\n     The parties agree that the kidnaping statute protects those\n\nwho have been kidnaped and held for any reason.            Before 1934, the\n\nFederal Kidnaping Act applied only if the captive was held for\n\nransom or reward.        See United States v. Healy, 376 U.S. 75, 81\n\n(1964). Congress amended the Act in 1934 to encompass persons held\n\n“for ransom or reward or otherwise.”             Id.     In Gooch v. United\n\nStates, 297 U.S. 124, 128 (1936), the Court interpreted the “or\n\n\n                                     30\n\fotherwise” amendment to encompass any benefit a captor might\n\nattempt to receive. Subsequently, in Healy, the Court held the Act\n\nis not limited to kidnapings for an ultimately illegal purpose.17\n\n      Consistent with the Court’s pronouncements, this court held in\n\nClinton v. United States, 260 F.2d 824, 825 (5th Cir. 1958), that\n\nan indictment need not include the words “for ransom, reward or\n\notherwise.”     The panel reasoned that the phrase would add nothing\n\n“because obviously 'otherwise' comprehends any purpose at all.”\n\nId.\n\n      Webster asserts that we overruled Clinton in United States v.\n\nOsborne, 68 F.3d 94 (5th Cir. 1995).           In Osborne, we held that the\n\ngovernment must prove four elements of the kidnaping offense:\n\n“1) the transportation in interstate commerce; 2) of an uncon-\n\nsenting person who is 3) held for ransom, reward, or otherwise; and\n\n4) the acts were done knowingly and willingly.”                    Id. at 100.\n\nAccording to Webster, the third element requires the government to\n\nplead in the indictment and prove up at trial, and the court to\n\ninstruct the jury on, some specific purpose(s) for the kidnaping.\n\n      Osborne does not compel this conclusion. We certainly did not\n\npurport to overrule Clinton’s holding that the indictment need not\n\ninclude a benefit; the issue was not before us in Osborne.                     And\n\nnothing in Osborne contravenes Clinton.                 More accurately, the\n\n\n      17\n         See Healy, 376 U.S. at 82 (stating that “we find no compelling correlation\nbetween the propriety of the ultimate purpose sought to be furthered by a kidnaping\nand the undesirability of the act of kidnaping itself”).\n\n                                        31\n\fgravamen of the third element is the act of holding, not the\n\nbenefit.   If “otherwise” can include any purpose, adding it to the\n\nindictmentSSirrespective of whether it specifies the “otherwise”\n\nbenefitSSadds nothing.      This view consists with that of our sister\n\ncircuits.18\n\n\n\n\n      18\n         See United States v. Adams, 83 F.3d 1371, 1372-74 (11th Cir. 1996)\n(indictment sufficient that alleged only that the victim was “held”); United\nStates v. Martell, 335 F.2d 764, 766 (4th Cir. 1964 (same); Hayes v. United\nStates, 296 F.2d 657, 665-67 (8th Cir. 1961) (same); United States v. Atchison,\n524 F.2d 367, 369-71 (7th Cir. 1975) (indictment sufficient that merely alleged\nvictim was held for “ransom, reward, or otherwise”); United States v. Bentley,\n310 F.2d 685, 685 (6th Cir. 1962) (same); Hall v. United States, 410 F.2d 653,\n659-60 (4th Cir. 1969) (same); Loux v. United States, 389 F.2d 911, 914-16 (9th\nCir. 1968) (same).\n\n\n                                      32\n\f                                        b.\n\n      Webster points out that in many of the above-mentioned cases,\n\nincluding Clinton, one reason the court gave for finding the lack\n\nof specificity unproblematic is that the defendant can request a\n\nbill of particulars to clarify on what benefit the government will\n\nrely.      Webster made such a request, which the court denied; he\n\ncomplains that this prevented him from presenting an effective\n\ndefense.     We fail to see how.\n\n      Although    the    government     must   plead       and   prove    that   the\n\ndefendant held the victim for some purpose, the exact nature of\n\nthat purpose is inconsequential.             Indeed, as noted, any purpose\n\nwill do.      In arguments to the jury, the government mentioned\n\nseveral possible        benefits,    including      retribution     and   revenge,\n\nsexual gratification, greed, and that Lisa Rene knew too much; all\n\nare valid benefits. In light of this breadth, Webster’s claim that\n\nthe   failure    to   specify   a   benefit    in    the    indictment     or    jury\n\ninstructions denied him a defense is vapid.\n\n      If any benefit will do, the only possible defense is that the\n\ndefendant obtained absolutely no benefit at allSSand no pleading or\n\njury instruction is needed to prepare the defendant for this\n\ndefense.     Accordingly, we decline to require specificity in the\n\nfactual basis of the benefit.19\n\n\n\n\n      19\n        Cf. United States v. Barnhart, 889 F.2d 1374, 1378 (5th Cir. 1989) (holding\nfactual basis for falsity in perjury indictment not required).\n\n                                        33\n\f                                       c.\n\n     The only circumstance under which a jury might need to be\n\ninstructed on specific potential benefits is if the jurors must\n\nagree unanimously on what benefit the defendant derived; if that is\n\nthe case, failure to instruct on particular benefits (as well as\n\nthe failure to instruct on the required unanimity, of course) might\n\nconstitute reversible error.          On the other hand, if unanimity is\n\nnot required, an instruction on specific benefits proves pointless,\n\nbecause   each   juror   can   pick    a    benefit   from   among   the   facts\n\npresented at trial.\n\n     The question, then, should be framed as follows:                  If some\n\njurors believed that Webster held Lisa Rene for one purpose, e.g.,\n\nsexual gratification, and others believe for another benefit, e.g.,\n\nrevenge for a drug deal gone bad, does that disagreement, that lack\n\nof unanimity, evidence a reasonable doubt that Webster held Lisa\n\nRene for some benefit?     The inquiry is governed by United States v.\n\nCorrea-Ventura, 6 F.3d 1070 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n     In Correa-Ventura, we analyzed whether a jury needed to reach\n\nunanimous consensus on which of several weapons seized from the\n\ndefendant’s apartment had been used in the commission of a drug\n\ntrafficking offense.     In the process of holding factual unanimity\n\nwas not required, we explicated the case-by-case analysis we must\n\nfollow here.     See id. at 1081.\n\n     As we explained, the unanimity rule ensures that the jury has\n\n\n                                       34\n\ffound   guilt    beyond   reasonable    doubt,   and   disagreement    as   to\n\ncritical facts may reflect such doubt.           Id. at 1078.    But not all\n\nfacts require unanimity.       To determine which ones do, we examine\n\n“[s]tatutory     language    and   construction,       legislative    intent,\n\nhistorical treatment of the crime by the courts, duplicity concerns\n\nwith respect to defining the offense, and the likelihood of jury\n\nconfusion in light of the specific facts presented.”            Id. at 1082.\n\nAfter considering these factors, we conclude that the jury need not\n\nconcur on the benefit the defendant derived from holding the\n\nkidnaping victim.\n\n     Looking at the language of the element, we see that the actus\n\nreus proscribed is the “holding” of a victim.            The benefit, “for\n\nransom, reward, or otherwise,” merely adds purpose to the act of\n\nholding.    Looking to the offense as a whole, we see that the\n\nessential elements, stripped to the bones, are transporting and\n\nholding against consent with a mens rea. The “interstate commerce”\n\nserves as a mere jurisdictional hook, and the benefit language\n\nsimply provides guidance to a jury in understanding the crimeSSwhy\n\nthe defendant may have committed the offense.                 The essence of\n\nkidnaping   is   a   non-consensual     transporting    and   holding,   done\n\nwilfully or knowingly; the language in no way implies that the\n\nbenefit serves an important function in singling out the guilty\n\nfrom the innocent or in deterring future conduct.\n\n     The history of the offense also points to the insubstantial\n\n\n                                       35\n\frole of the benefit.         The Supreme Court has admonished that\n\nCongress added the “or otherwise” language because “ransom or\n\nreward” proved too narrow; Congress desired to expand the statute\n\nby eliminating the limiting effect that the phrase had.            See Gooch,\n\n297 U.S. at 128; Healy, 376 U.S. at 81-82.          We should not circum-\n\nscribe    the   statute’s   reach,   once   again   giving   the    phrase   a\n\nnarrowing function, by requiring factual concurrence among the\n\njurors.\n\n     Interpretive caselaw and the issue of duplicative convictions\n\nalso support rejecting a unanimity requirement. As cited above, we\n\nand our sister circuits always have emphasized the breadth of the\n\nbenefit phrase.      We are aware of no case in which a court has\n\nlimited the kidnaping offense through the benefit requirement.\n\n     In addition, concerns regarding duplicative convictions have\n\nnot arisen.     Webster does not argue that a lack of concurrence on\n\nthe factual predicate of a benefit risks duplicative convictions\n\nfor a single act of holding and transporting.          We know of no case\n\nin which a defendant was convicted of or even charged with multiple\n\nkidnaping offenses of the same victim because it was done for more\n\nthan one benefit.\n\n     Finally, the circumstances of the instant case do not justify\n\nvacating the sentence and requiring unanimity on the benefit.\n\nSeveral benefits were argued to the jury.           There was sufficient\n\nevidence from which a juror could find that Webster was motivated\n\n\n                                     36\n\fby the lure of those benefits.              Indeed, if unanimity had been\n\nrequired, it is likely that the jury unanimously would have found\n\nseveral benefits garnered by Webster, including revenge and sexual\n\ngratification. The court provided a general unanimity instruction,\n\nfocusing the jury’s attention on the need to agree on the essential\n\nelements of the crime.          Unanimity on the factual basis of the\n\nbenefit is not required, and the court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin refusing Webster’s instruction.20\n\n\n\n                                       C.\n\n      Webster contends that his arrest was unconstitutional and that\n\nthe fruits obtained from it should have been suppressed.                    More\n\nspecifically, he argues that the court erred by failing to suppress\n\nthe fruits of the search of Webster and his automobile following\n\nhis arrest, that any purported consent given by him was nullified\n\nby the illegality of the arrest, and that the court erred by\n\nfailing to suppress his statements following his arrest.                       It\n\nreadily becomes apparent that Webster’s arguments hinge on his view\n\nthat the arrest was unconstitutional.            Because we find both this\n\narrest and subsequent police conduct fully constitutional, the\n\ncourt properly admitted the fruits of the search and the subsequent\n\n\n      20\n         Cf.

See United States v.\n\nTompkins,    130   F.3d   117,    120   (5th    Cir.   1997),    cert.   denied,\n\n118 S. Ct. 1335 (1998).          So, we review the historical facts for\n\nclear error    and   ultimate     legal      determinations     de   novo.   Id.\n\nBecause Webster does not challenge the findings of fact, our review\n\nis limited to a de novo review of the legal conclusions.\n\n\n\n                                        2.\n\n       The Fourth Amendment requires that all arrests be based on\n\nprobable cause.      See U.S. CONST. amend. IV; Gerstein v. Pugh,\n\n420 U.S. 103, 111 (1975).        Probable cause is “defined in terms of\n\nfacts and circumstances 'sufficient to warrant a prudent man in\n\nbelieving that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an\n\noffense.'”     Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 111 (quoting Beck v. Ohio,\n\n379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964)) (alteration in original).                Based on this\n\nstandard, the police had probable cause to arrest Webster.\n\n       The day before the arrest, police took a written statement\n\nfrom    Beckley,   Webster’s     partner-in-crime.         This      inculpatory\n\nstatement suggested Webster’s criminal involvement in the kidnaping\n\n\n                                        38\n\f(and ultimate murder) of Lisa Rene.   Such statements taken from an\n\naccomplice give rise to probable cause to arrest those so impli-\n\ncated. United States v. Barfield, 507 F.2d 53, 58 (5th Cir. 1975).\n\n     Matters admittedly are complicated by the fact that, although\n\nthe police had probable cause to arrest Webster following Beckley’s\n\nstatements, they did not know exactly who Webster was.     That is,\n\nthe issue of identification comes into play, as the police must\n\nhave had probable cause to believe that the man whom they arrested\n\nwas indeed Webster. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we\n\nfind that such probable cause existed.\n\n     Beckley identified Webster as “B-Love” and described him as “a\n\nblack dude about 20 years old, about 5'9\", 150-160 pounds, black\n\nlow cut hair, brown skinned.”   Beckley explained how he and B-Love\n\nwere involved in the sale of marihuana and how the kidnaping of\n\nLisa Rene arose from Beckley and Webster’s drug transactions.\n\n     Beckley told the police that he and B-Love took Lisa Rene to\n\na cheap motel, tying her to a chair in a room that ended in the\n\ndigits “13.”   Beckley led Detective Ford and FBI Special Agent\n\nFloyd to this motel, called the Pine Bluff Motel.    He took them to\n\nroom 513, which he identified as the room in which he and B-Love\n\nhad taken Rene.   Floyd interviewed the hotel manager, obtaining a\n\nreceipt for room 513 in the name of Bruce Webster.\n\n     FBI Special Agent Mason and Agent McCall were assigned to\n\nassist Ford and Floyd by going to the motel to help gather\n\n\n\n                                 39\n\fevidence.   They were told to be on the lookout for “B-Love,” who\n\nhad kidnaped Lisa Rene and kept her in room 513.   Mason and McCall\n\nquestioned a security guard about the guests of room 513 and were\n\ntold that a local man named Bruce Webster had stayed in that room,\n\nalong with three other black men, on the dates in question.     The\n\nguard added that Webster went by the nickname of “B-Love” and\n\ndescribed him as “a black male, approximately 5'8\" tall and 150\n\npounds,” seen wearing a black leather cap and driving an older\n\nAmerican, dark blue, square-looking sedan. The guard also told the\n\nagents that Webster was a drug dealer.\n\n     Later that day, the agents observed a black man driving an\n\nolder American, dark blue, square-looking car and wearing a black\n\nleather cap; a woman was in the passenger seat.          The agents\n\nsignaled the suspect to stop; in response, the suspect sped up,\n\napparently attempting to flee. The agents pursued, and when one of\n\nthem shouted “B-Love, this is the F.B.I.    Stop where you are and\n\nput your hands up,” the driver stopped.   The driver was, of course,\n\nWebster, also known as B-Love.    At that point, the police placed\n\nWebster on the ground and handcuffed him.\n\n     The agents had probable cause to arrest Webster for kidnaping.\n\nAlthough they did not have personal knowledge of his specific\n\nwrongdoings, they are permitted to act on the probable cause\n\ndetermination of others in their department. See Charles v. Smith,\n\n894 F.2d 718, 724 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n                                 40\n\f      The security guard’s description of B-Love was sufficiently\n\ndetailed and accurate to provide the police with probable cause to\n\nbelieve that      the   man   they were      arresting     was   B-Love.21      The\n\nreliability (in terms of veracity) of the guard, as a disinterested\n\nwitness, is presumed.         See United States v. Hernandez, 825 F.2d\n\n846, 849 (5th Cir. 1987).\n\n      Moreover, “the sufficiency of a particular description is\n\nlargely a factual matter,” so we give greater deference to the\n\ndistrict court’s finding of probable cause under these circum-\n\nstances.     See Pollack, 739 F.2d at 190.          And in doing so, we must\n\nrecall     that   “sufficient     probability,      not    certainty,     is    the\n\ntouchstone of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment.”22\n\n\n\n                                        3.\n\n      Even if the police initially lacked probable cause to arrest\n\nWebster, they most certainly had reasonable suspicion to stop him.\n\nSee Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22-24 (1968); United States v.\n\nWatson, 953 F.2d 895, 897 (5th Cir. 1992). Their actions following\n\n\n\n      21\n         See, e.g., United States v. Pollack, 739 F.2d 187, 190 (5th Cir. 1984)\n(holding that probable cause existed to arrest individual described as “a white\nmale, approximately 50 years old, 5'8 or 5'9, with a short, stocky, medium build,\nglasses, and a receding hairline, wearing a dark blue or black coat, a light colored\nshirt and blue jeans”); United State v. Maryland, 479 F.2d 566, 569 (5th Cir. 1973)\n(declaring that probable cause existed to arrest individuals described as “four\nNegroes, two men and two women . . . traveling in a 'black and white vinyl over\ngreen Cadillac'”).\n\n      22\n        Hill v. California, 401 U.S. 797, 804 (1971) (holding that probable cause\nexisted even though the police arrested the wrong person because of an imperfect\ndescription).\n\n                                        41\n\fthis legitimate stop were likewise constitutional, so all the\n\nevidence and statements gathered from Webster are admissible.\n\n     Reasonable suspicion is a standard lower than probable cause.\n\nTerry, 392 U.S. at 16-22; Watson, 953 F.2d at 897 n.1.         Reasonable\n\nsuspicion sufficient to justify a Terry stop exists when law\n\nenforcement officials are able to point to “specific and articul-\n\nable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from\n\nthose facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.”         Terry, 392 U.S.\n\nat 21.   The matching description of Webster, taken together with\n\nthe guard’s identification of him as a drug dealer and his presence\n\nat the motel, satisfy this test of reasonable suspicion.\n\n     After stopping Webster, the police were within their constitu-\n\ntional authority to pat him down for their personal safety. Terry,\n\n392 U.S. at 27-28; United States v. Michelletti, 13 F.3d 838,\n\n840-41 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc).          They also were within their\n\nauthority to handcuff Webster, even if probable cause to arrest him\n\nwas lacking.   See United States v. Sanders, 994 F.2d 200, 205-07\n\n(5th Cir. 1993).\n\n     In addition, the police acted constitutionally when they asked\n\nWebster whether he had any needles in his pockets that could injure\n\nthem during their pat down; such questioning, needed to protect the\n\nofficers,   does   not   constitute    interrogation   under   Miranda   v.\n\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).         See New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S.\n\n649, 655 (1984).    Accordingly, Webster’s response, indicating that\n\n\n                                      42\n\fhe had marihuana in his pocket, was not obtained in violation of\n\nMiranda and was fully admissible.\n\n      Webster’s admission that he possessed marihuana gave the\n\npolice     probable   cause   to   arrest    him,   at   the   very   least    for\n\nnarcotics possession.          This renders unproblematic the lengthy\n\n(1½-hour) detention of which Webster complains.\n\n      Lengthy detentions following Terry stops are often problem-\n\natic, because they serve to escalate an investigatory stop, which\n\ncan be initiated with only reasonable suspicion, into an arrest,\n\nwhich requires probable cause.23              In this case, however, the\n\nofficers’ reasonable suspicion developed into probable cause when\n\nWebster indicated that he possessed drugs, and when the police\n\nuncovered the key to room 513 on his person.                Consequently, the\n\nconversion of Webster’s investigatory stop into an arrest is both\n\nproper and to be expected.         Adams, 407 U.S. at 148-49.         The search\n\nof Webster’s person was in order as a valid search incident to a\n\nvalid arrest.     United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 802 (1974).\n\n      Next, the police searched Webster’s car, revealing two guns\n\nand other incriminating items.           There are two valid, independent\n\njustifications for this police action, although only one is needed\n\nto affirm.\n\n      First, as the search of Webster’s person revealed a key to\n\n      23\n         See Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 146 (1972); see also California v.\nBeheler, 463 U.S. 1121, 1123-25 (1983) (holding that whether an individual has been\narrested, in the constitutional sense, is an objective, legal determination based\non the circumstances of his restraint).\n\n                                        43\n\froom 513, police now had undisputable probable cause to arrest for\n\nthe kidnaping.         Therefore,     it   was   reasonable        for    the   police\n\nthoroughly to search Webster’s car for evidence of the kidnaping.\n\nSee California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565, 579-80 (1991).\n\n     Second,     Webster   orally      consented     to     this    search.        See\n\nSchneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 235 (1973).                     Such consent\n\noperates as a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights if, by a preponder-\n\nance of the evidence, it is found to have been given voluntarily\n\nunder the totality of the circumstances. See id. at 235-40; United\n\nStates v. Cooper, 43 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir. 1995).                       Factors to\n\nconsider in making this determination are the coerciveness of\n\npolice procedures, the extent of the defendant’s cooperation, his\n\nawareness   of   his    right   to   refuse      consent,    his    education      and\n\nintelligence, and his belief as to whether incriminating evidence\n\nwill be found.     Cooper, 43 F.3d at 144.\n\n     Webster’s experience in police procedure, resulting from his\n\nlengthy criminal record, belies the assertion that he was unaware\n\nof his rights or uneducated as to the situation he faced.                       And the\n\nfact that the police asked him not once but twice for permission to\n\nsearch his automobile (the second time being when they came to the\n\ntrunk of the car) undercuts the argument that the police were\n\ncoercive in their request.           Under these facts, Webster’s consent\n\nwas freely given.\n\n\n\n\n                                       44\n\f                                     D.\n\n     Webster argues that the court erred by denying his motion to\n\ndismiss the government’s notice to seek the death penalty based on\n\nracial discrimination in the charging decision and by denying his\n\ndiscovery request on this issue. To support the motion to dismiss,\n\nWebster offered an affidavit showing that 66% of federal death\n\npenalty cases involved black defendants. The court denied both the\n\nmotion to dismiss and the motion for discovery and an evidentiary\n\nhearing, noting that Webster had failed to make out the requisite\n\nprima facie case that he had been singled out for prosecution but\n\nothers similarly situated were not prosecuted.\n\n\n\n                                     1.\n\n     We review constitutional claims de novo. See Estrada-Trochez,\n\n66 F.3d 733, 735 (5th Cir. 1995).         A district court’s decisions in\n\noverseeing criminal discovery, however, receive great deference on\n\nappeal.   Alleged    errors   are    subject     to   review   for   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion,   and   we   reverse    only    if   a    defendant   establishes\n\nprejudice to substantial rights.          United States v. Mora, 994 F.2d\n\n1129, 1138 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\n                                     2.\n\n                                     a.\n\n     The decision to prosecute one person and not another is a\n\n\n                                     45\n\fproper exercise of executive discretion with which we are reticent\n\nto interfere.   United States v. Hoover, 727 F.2d 387, 389 (5th Cir.\n\n1984). To establish that the government has engaged in unconstitu-\n\ntionally discriminatory selective prosecution, a defendant must\n\nmake a two-pronged showing.\n\n     First, he needs to make out a prima facie showing that he has\n\nbeen singled out for prosecution but others similarly situated of\n\na different race were not prosecuted.             See United States v.\n\nArmstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 465 (1996); United States v. Sparks,\n\n2 F.3d 574, 580 (5th Cir. 1993); Hoover, 727 F.2d at 389.                 In\n\nArmstrong, the Court stated, “The vast majority of Courts of\n\nAppeals   require   the   defendant    to   produce   some   evidence   that\n\nsimilarly situated defendants of other races could have been\n\nprosecuted, but were not, and this requirement is consistent with\n\nour equal protection case law.”             Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 469.\n\nSecond, he must demonstrate that the discriminatory selection of\n\nhim for prosecution is invidious or in bad faith, in that it rests\n\non such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the\n\ndesire to prevent his exercise of his constitutional rights.             See\n\nSparks, 2 F.3d at 580; Hoover, 727 F.2d at 389.\n\n     In making these requisite showings, the defendant must rebut\n\nthe presumption that the government made its decision to prosecute\n\nin good faith and in a nondiscriminatory manner.         Hoover, 727 F.2d\n\nat 389.   To dispel the presumption of prosecutorial good faith, “a\n\n                                      46\n\fcriminal defendant must present 'clear evidence to the contrary.'”\n\nId. at      465    (quoting    United   States   v.   Chemical   Found.,    Inc.,\n\n272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926)).\n\n      A defendant is not automatically entitled to an evidentiary\n\nhearing to make the required showing.            He must first present facts\n\n“sufficient to create a reasonable doubt about the constitutional-\n\nity of [his] prosecution” resulting from selective prosecution.24\n\nMere statistical evidence of racial disparity usually will be\n\nper se insufficient to support an inference of any “unacceptable\n\nrisk” of racial discrimination in the administration of capital\n\npunishment.        McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 294-97 (1987).\n\n\n\n                                          b.\n\n      Webster has failed to make a sufficient showing that he was\n\nsingled out for selective prosecution.             He has not even attempted\n\nto   show    that    other    similarly    situated   individuals      committing\n\nsimilar     acts    were     not   prosecuted.    Such   a   showing    would   be\n\nchallenging under the FDPA, as no one yet had been prosecuted under\n\nthat Act when Webster was indicted.               But Webster also did not\n\nattempt to make the showing under other federal death penalty acts.\n\n      Webster relies primarily on his statistical evidence, which\n\n\n\n      24\n         United States v. Jennings, 724 F.2d 436, 445-46 (5th Cir. 1984) (finding\nbare generic allegations concerning the selective prosecution of racial groups\ninsufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing); United States v. Ramirez, 765 F.2d\n438, 440 (5th Cir. 1985) (holding “conclusional allegations of impermissible motive\nare not sufficient” to demonstrate the government acted in bad faith).\n\n                                          47\n\funder McCleskey fails to rebut the good faith presumption. Webster\n\ncites McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 293 n.12, which may allow finding a\n\nconstitutional violation (or prima facie finding thereof) in very\n\nlimited    circumstances     if   the   data   presents    a   “stark”   enough\n\npicture. But the 66% figure Webster provides is no more stark than\n\nwere the statistics in the Baldus Study at issue in McCleskey.25\n\n      Webster also argues that counsel would have shown that they\n\nhad requested that the Department of Justice consider this racial\n\ndisproportionality as a factor mitigating against authorization of\n\nthe death penalty in this case, and the government refused because\n\nof “the purported 'race neutrality' required by DOJ policies in\n\ncapital charging decisions.”            Likewise, Webster contends that\n\n“failure of the Government to 'affirmatively act' to overcome such\n\nracially discriminatory application” of the death penalty “amounted\n\nto purposeful discrimination.”          This, however, fails to establish\n\nthe discriminatory purpose required under the second prong of the\n\nselective prosecution test.\n\n      Discriminatory purpose “implies that the decisionmaker . . .\n\nselected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in\n\npart 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects\n\nupon an identifiable group.”        Id. at 291 (quotation omitted).          The\n\n\n      25\n        Baldus reported that Georgia prosecutors sought the death penalty in 70%\nof the cases involving black defendants and white victims, 32% of the cases\ninvolving white defendants and white victims, 15% of the cases involving black\ndefendants and black victims, and 19% of the cases involving white defendants and\nblack victims. See McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 287.\n\n                                        48\n\fabove evidence, at best, shows action in spite of a putatively\n\nadverse discriminatory effect and not purposeful discrimination.\n\n      Furthermore, a non-discriminatory explanation for seeking the\n\ndeath penalty against Webster is evident on the facts:                   It is\n\njustified by the objective circumstances of the crime and the\n\nsufficiency and availability of evidence to prove the required\n\nelements under the law.        These are the precise considerations the\n\nSupreme Court identified as proper and legitimate grounds for such\n\na decision.     See id. at 307 n.28.            The verdict attests to the\n\nobjective considerations, and Webster has made no effort to rebut\n\nthem.\n\n\n\n                                       3.\n\n      Webster’s attempt to obtain discovery on the issue stands on\n\nequally faulty ground. In Armstrong, the Court addressed the issue\n\nof   the   showing    necessary   to   obtain    discovery   on   a   claim    of\n\nselective prosecution based on racial discrimination.                 The Court\n\nfirst quickly disposed of any claim for discovery under FED. R.\n\nCRIM. P. 16, stating, “We hold that Rule 16(a)(1)(C) authorizes the\n\ndefendants    to     examine   Government   documents    material       to    the\n\npreparation of their defense against the Government’s case-in-\n\nchief, but not to the preparation of selective-prosecution claims.”\n\nArmstrong, 517 U.S. at 463.\n\n      Webster contends that a defendant “necessarily has a lesser\n\n\n                                       49\n\fburden when seeking discovery to aid in proving the elements of a\n\nprima facie case of selective prosecution.”         The Court, however,\n\nheld squarely against Webster’s assertion, stating, “The justifica-\n\ntion for a rigorous standard for the elements of a selective\n\nprosecution claim thus require a correspondingly rigorous standard\n\nfor discovery in aid of such a claim.”       Id. at 468.\n\n     Finally, Webster argues that he requested the discovery also\n\nto establish mitigating evidence that a death sentence would\n\npropagate a racially discriminatory application of the federal\n\ndeath penalty.      Webster makes no argument other than that a\n\ndefendant is entitled to present any mitigating evidence, which he\n\nwas denied by denial of the discovery request.\n\n     The government aptly responds that the Armstrong discovery\n\nrule for selective prosecution applies, requiring a prima facie\n\nshowing.   Any other rule would allow circumvention of Armstrong’s\n\nrequirements.\n\n     Furthermore,   the   Court   in    Armstrong   justified   its   high\n\nstandard for discovery in selective prosecution claims, explaining:\n\n     Judicial deference to the decisions of [prosecutors]\n     rests in part on an assessment of the relative competence\n     of prosecutors and the courts.      Such factors as the\n     strength of the case, the prosecution’s general deter-\n     rence value, the Government’s enforcement priorities, and\n     the case’s relationship to the Government’s overall\n     enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind\n     of analysis courts are competent to undertake. It also\n     stems from a concern not to unnecessarily impair the\n     performance of a core executive constitutional function.\n     Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal\n     proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by\n\n                                   50\n\f     subjecting the prosecutor’s motives and decisionmaking to\n     outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effec-\n     tiveness by revealing the Governments enforcement policy.\n\n517 U.S. at 465 (citations and quotations omitted). The competency\n\nconcerns apply a fortiori when lay jurors are asked to analyze\n\nprosecutorial decisions.\n\n     In addition, Webster had the statistical evidence regarding\n\nthe allegedly discriminatory manner in which the modern federal\n\ndeath penalty has been applied and yet chose not to attempt to\n\nintroduce it during the sentencing hearings; this may indicate his\n\nlack of confidence in this evidence’s mitigating value.\n\n\n\n                                E.\n\n     Webster contends that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion for post-trial discovery on the issue of whether one of the\n\ncase’s lead law enforcement investigators, Special Agent Floyd, had\n\n“purchased” the testimony of a prosecution witness, John Clay, by\n\nallowing a conjugal visit at a private residence in violation of\n\nagency guidelines.   Webster argues that if discovery had verified\n\nthis claim, it would have impeached the testimony of Clay and\n\nFloyd, thus constituting grounds for a new trial.\n\n\n\n                                1.\n\n     We review discovery rulings for abuse of discretion.

We will order a\n\nnew trial based on discovery violations only where the party\n\ndemonstrates prejudice to his substantial rights.          Dukes, 139 F.3d\n\nat 476.      To prevail, then, Webster must establish that “there is a\n\nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the\n\ndefense, the result of the proceeding would have been different\n\n. . . .        [A] reasonable probability is shown where the non-\n\ndisclosure 'could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such\n\na different light as to undermine confidence in the jury verdict.'”\n\nUnited States v. Visher, 106 F.3d 622, 634 (5th Cir. 1997) (quoting\n\nWestley v. Johnson, 83 F.3d 714, 725 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. denied,\n\n117 S. Ct. 773 (1997)).\n\n\n\n                                     2.\n\n     The government introduced testimony from Clay during the\n\nrebuttal portion of the penalty phase.             Clay, who had charges\n\npending against him for drug dealing that included the possibility\n\nof a life sentence, was taken to the holdover cell on the second\n\nfloor   of    the   federal   courthouse.   When    he   arrived   from   the\n\nMansfield Correctional Enforcement Center, Webster was present in\n\nthe holdover cell.        Webster then left and came back and began\n\njumping around, saying that “there has got to be a God” because his\n\ntrial had been set to a later day.          Clay testified that Webster\n\n\n                                     52\n\falso preached a thirty-minute sermon, “quot[ing] scriptures out of\n\nthe Bible that has to be photographic in his mind because it was so\n\naccurate.” Clay and Webster conversed in “pig latin” after Webster\n\nstarted using it.       Clay demonstrated pig latin for the jury.\n\n     Webster then told Clay about a “master mind plan” to arrange\n\nfor each of them to have sexual contact with a female inmate by\n\nmanipulating the visiting process.           Before the two men were taken\n\nback to Mansfield, Webster told Clay that he would write a letter\n\nto him in pig latin to explain the plan.          Webster in fact sent such\n\na letter to ClaySSthe letter was introduced into evidence, with the\n\ndefense stipulation        that   Webster   had   authored     it.   With    the\n\nprosecutor reading the letter, Clay interpreted some of the slang\n\nused.\n\n     Clay also testified that he was cooperating with the govern-\n\nment in hopes of a sentence reduction.                  Counsel for Webster\n\nquestioned Clay about his criminal background and his current\n\ncharges, and attempted to impeach Clay by implying that he was\n\nangry with Webster because Webster allegedly had written a letter\n\nto Clay’s girlfriend, who also was a prisoner at the Mansfield\n\nCorrectional Center.\n\n     Floyd     testified    during   the    penalty    phase   regarding    oral\n\nstatements Webster made while in custody.             The statements included\n\nthat killing Lisa Rene was “just business.”26\n\n     26\n          Floyd also provided some of the testimony relevant to the admission of\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                       53\n\f      Approximately two months after trial and two days after filing\n\na motion for new trial, Webster filed an addendum to his motion for\n\nnew trial, setting forth an allegation from a local newscast that\n\nFloyd had permitted Clay to engage in a conjugal visit with Clay’s\n\ngirlfriend after Floyd had taken Clay from the detention center for\n\nan unrelated investigation.        Webster alleged that this “reward” to\n\nClay should have been reported to the defense pursuant to Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).        Webster asked the court to order the\n\ngovernment to disclose any information that reasonably could be\n\nobtained      regarding     inducements     given   by   Floyd   to    Clay   and,\n\nspecifically, that the government be ordered to disclose the\n\nresults of any investigation relating to the matter.                  The govern-\n\nment already had volunteered to provide the requested information\n\nto Webster, subject to confidentiality limitations.\n\n      In its response to the motion for new trial, the government\n\nreaffirmed its continuing obligation and intention to disclose any\n\nmitigating or impeaching evidence.            The government further noted\n\nthat it would work with Webster’s counsel to help them secure\n\naffidavits that had been filed in other cases in connection with\n\nthe allegations. Webster then filed a motion in which he requested\n\nthe court to\n\n      order the attorneys for the government to produce and\n\n\n      26\n           (...continued)\nWebster’s confession. As discussed above, the district court properly denied the\nmotion to suppress the confession; the questions Webster raises regarding Floyd’s\ncredibility do not alter that determination.\n\n                                       54\n\f     hand over to the defense counsel all information associ-\n     ated with the activities of Special Agent Garrett Floyd\n     of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that are related\n     to the granting of inducements, favors, privileges,\n     rewards, concessions or anything of value to any witness\n     directly or indirectly associated with this instant case.\n     This order should extend as well to any other case which\n     is, or may be, a part of a systematic action on the part\n     of Agent Floyd or other government actors to grant favors\n     to witnesses in return for their testimony.\n\nCounsel for Webster acknowledged that he had received copies of the\n\naffidavits used in other cases involving the same allegation and\n\nthat defense investigators were looking into other possible sources\n\nof information.\n\n     In response to the motion for post-trial discovery, the\n\ngovernment noted that the district court having jurisdiction over\n\nthe cases in which this allegation had been made had determined\n\nthat Floyd was unaware that Clay had had sexual contact while in\n\nFloyd’s custody and that a new trial was not warranted.                  The\n\ngovernment asked the court to deny Webster’s post-trial motion\n\nbecause   the   motion   was   too   broad,   and   again   reiterated   its\n\ncontinuing discovery obligation.\n\n     The court denied Webster’s motion, stating that even\n     assuming that all of the facts asserted in [Webster’s]\n     motion and the addendum are trueSSthat the Federal Bureau\n     of Investigation Special Agent assigned with primary\n     responsibility for investigating this case took federal\n     prisoner John Clay from his detention facility, trans-\n     ported him to the home of a female friend, and knowingly\n     allowed Clay and the female to engage in sexual activi-\n     ties, all in exchange for Clay’s testimony in this cause,\n     and the prosecutor knowingly withheld this information\n     from Defendant,\n\nthe evidence was not material.         Citing United States v. Bagley,\n\n\n                                     55\n\f473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985), the court found that even if this\n\ninformation had been disclosed before trial, the result would have\n\nbeen the same.\n\n\n\n                                 3.\n\n     The court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion\n\nfor post-trial discovery.   Even assuming the allegations are true,\n\nthey fail to undermine confidence in the verdict.    Clay was only\n\none of many government witnesses who testified to rebut Webster’s\n\nclaim of mental retardation, including school teachers, counselors,\n\nprincipals, employers, and detention center personnel.     Much of\n\nClay’s testimony focused on the letter written by Webster’s own\n\nhand that set forth the “plan” for a sexual rendezvous with female\n\ninmates.   It is evident from the record that Webster concocted the\n\nelaborate scheme to manipulate the detention center’s visitation\n\nsystem and sought Clay’s assistance.   Clay’s other testimony could\n\nbe redacted, and there would still be ample evidence to support the\n\njury’s findings regarding Webster’s mental abilities.\n\n     Furthermore, Clay admitted that he had testified in hopes of\n\na reduced sentence, and the defense impeached his testimony with\n\nthe allegation that Clay held a grudge against Webster.    Further\n\nimpeachment via the possible quid pro quo of sex for testimony\n\nlikely would not have affected more than marginally the weight the\n\njury gave to Clay’s testimony.\n\n\n\n                                 56\n\f       With respect to Floyd’s testimony, he too was only one of many\n\nwitnesses who testified regarding Webster’s future dangerousness.\n\nOther   witnesses   included   Special      Agent   William   Eppright,    who\n\ntestified that, on an occasion separate from the one testified to\n\nby Floyd, Webster said killing Lisa Rene was “strictly business.”\n\nMohamed Ghene testified regarding Webster’s attempted robbery of\n\nhis clothing store and the shots Webster fired at him from across\n\nthe street.     Tlisha Booth presented testimony pertaining to a\n\nshoving match over a piece of candy.        Sylvia Henry, corroborated by\n\na security guard and Booth, testified that Webster had assaulted\n\nher at a nightclub.      Pine Bluff Police Department Officer Lance\n\nLawhorn testified that, while he was transporting Webster, Webster\n\nstated that if he was not in custody he would “kill the bitch” who\n\ngave him a venereal disease.        Even if Floyd’s testimony regarding\n\nWebster’s oral statements were redacted, the record provides ample\n\nevidence of future dangerousness.\n\n       Moreover, any damage to Floyd’s credibility caused by these\n\nallegations would be mitigated by the finding of the district court\n\nwith    jurisdiction   over   the   cases   where   the   allegations     were\n\ninitially made that Floyd was unaware that Clay had any sexual\n\ncontact while in his custody and that a new trial was not war-\n\nranted.    There is no reasonable probability that the verdict would\n\nhave been different had the jury known of the alleged Floyd-Clay\n\nincident, so the court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\ndiscovery.\n\n                                     57\n\f                                      F.\n\n      Webster argues the district court lacked a statutory or\n\nconstitutional (Fifth Amendment) basis to compel him to submit to\n\na mental health exam by a government expert as a prerequisite to\n\nintroducing his own expert psychiatric testimony.                We find no\n\nerror.\n\n\n\n                                      1.\n\n      Although compelling Webster to a government psychiatric exam,\n\nthe   court also granted, in part, Webster’s motion to limit the\n\nscope of the exam.      Specifically, the court barred examination of\n\nWebster’s future dangerousness.            The government’s witness, Dr.\n\nGeorge Parker, however, testified that he found that Webster’s\n\nincarceration would lead to “a potentially very dangerous situa-\n\ntion.”     Webster argues this aspect of the testimony constitutes a\n\nFifth Amendment violation.\n\n      Webster’s argument falls well short of reversible error.\n\nFirst, he mischaracterizes the record.          There is no evidence that\n\nany government expert was asked to27 or did conduct an examination\n\nof Webster with regard to his future dangerousness.           The reports of\n\nDr. Coons and Dr. Parker state that they had sufficient data to\n\nassess Webster’s future dangerousness without examination designed\n\n\n      27\n         When first contacted and hired, before the court’s limiting order,\nDr. Coons was informed that part of the exam would be for future dangerousness.\nBut nothing in the record indicates that either Coons or Dr. Parker actually\nconducted an exam for future dangerousness.\n\n                                      58\n\fto uncover that.      Our reading of the record leads us to conclude\n\nthat, contrary to Webster’s assertion, Coon’s testimony regarding\n\nWebster’s future dangerousness did not turn on an examination in\n\nviolation of the court ordered limits.\n\n      Second, Webster never objected on these grounds, so he failed\n\nto preserve the issue for appeal.          Finally, even if such testimony\n\nwere given and properly objected to, the error of allowing the\n\ntestimony proves harmless, because there is ample independent\n\nevidence to support a finding of future dangerousness.28\n\n\n\n                                      2.\n\n      The Hall panel avoided the question of statutory authority\n\nbecause it had not been properly briefed.              See Hall, 152 F.3d\n\nat 398.    We now face the issue and conclude that the district court\n\nhad the authority to order the exam.\n\n\n\n                                      a.\n\n      A district court’s decisions in overseeing criminal discovery\n\nare entitled to great deference.             Alleged error is subject to\n\nreview for abuse of discretion, and we will reverse only if a\n\ndefendant establishes prejudice to substantial rights.

Energy Gathering, Inc., 2 F.3d 1397, 1406 (5th Cir.\n\n1993).     In fact, FED. R. CRIM. P. 57(b) provides that where no law\n\nor rule is directly applicable, \"[a] judge may regulate practice in\n\nany manner consistent with federal law, these rules, and local\n\nrules of the district.\"         The existence of the federal rules does\n\nnot preempt this power, if the rules do not exclude the exercise of\n\nthe specific putative inherent power.

We   give   considerable\n\ndeference to the decision to excuse a juror on this basis, because\n\nsuch decisions are based on face-to-face credibility assessments.33\n\n\n\n\n      33\n         See Flores, 63 F.3d at 1355; see also Witt, 469 U.S. at 426-29 (although\nin habeas context, discussing universal reasons for deference); United States v.\nBryant, 991 F.2d 171, 174 (5th Cir. 1993) (decision to excuse juror for actual bias\nreviewed for manifest abuse of discretion).\n\n                                        63\n\f                                        2.\n\n      Webster’s argument focuses on Vicar’s statements that she\n\nbelieved capital punishment was a deterrent to crime and that “the\n\npossibility is there” that situations existed in which she could\n\nimpose a death sentence.            Based on this, Webster believes her\n\nability to perform her duties as a juror was not impaired.\n\n      Other excerpts, however, support the government’s concern and\n\nthe court’s decision.         Vicar stated, “I mean from one day to the\n\nnext, I don’t have the same opinion of what I could do.                  I think\n\nthere could be, depending on what the situations were, that I could\n\nsay, yes, that’s what it should be, that’s what the penalty should\n\nbe.   I don’t consistently, from day to day, think I could actually\n\ndo that if there really is a life sentence.”\n\n      Indeed, in answering several questions, Vicar wavered on\n\nwhether she could sentence a defendant to death if a life sentence\n\nwithout parole option were a viable alternative.34             The government,\n\n\n      34\n           During questioning by the government, Vicar gave the following answers:\n\n      A.      I guess it’s not something that I have ever wanted to do.\n              I guess I have debated since we filled out that questionnaire\n              whether I could really do it or not, but that doesn’t say\n              I don’t think it’s necessary. I guess I asked the question\n              this morning about whether we really had a life sentence that\n              were truly without parole or any chance of getting out.\n              I don’t know if I could tell you at this time whether I could\n              make a decision for the death penalty orSSI mean, I don’t know\n              if I could sit here and tell you today whether I could really\n              do that or not. That’s why I had the questions I had this\n              morning about whether if you’re telling me there really is a\n              life sentence without parole, if that is really true, if you\n              tell me in the courtroom that there is that option.\n\n      Q       . . . knowing that a person you might convict of an offense\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                        64\n\fin objecting to Vicar, pointed to her demeanor, her long pauses\n\nbefore answering questions, and her admission of equivocation.\n\nAlthough she stated she could envision circumstances in which she\n\nmight be able to impose a death sentence, the presence of the\n\nalternative of a life sentence without parole raised serious\n\nquestions about her ability to follow the law.               In addition, the\n\nwhole of her testimony could have left the court with the impres-\n\nsion that she favored the death penalty as a theoretical necessity,\n\nbut would not be able to recommend it.          The court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion     in   granting    the   challenge    for   cause    for   Vicar's\n\ninability to apply the death sentence.\n\n\n\n\n     34\n          (...continued)\n             like this is never going to be released, ever, period, and\n             he’s going to be in prison for the rest of his life, that\n             realistically you could never vote for the death penalty, then\n             you really need to let us know that now, okay?\n\n     A.      I guess I feel likeSSsince there is that other option, I’m not\n             sure.   I thought before that I could vote for the death\n             penalty, but I don’t really know, if it came right down to it,\n             if I could do it or not. I’m not saying that I could not.\n             I guess a lot of it would just have to do with the facts of\n             the case. I don’t know if I could do it or not. I couldn’t\n             tell you that I know I could or that I know I couldn’t.\n\n     .\n     Q.      . . . Why do you feel that would be such a           problem?\n             Realistically, why do you feel that’s a problem?\n\n     A.      I guess I’m just torn between the fact of whether I thought\n             there were cases that I have heard of that I thought that’s\n             exactly what they deserved, but whether I couldSSwhether that\n             decisionSSI guess whether it conflicts with my religious\n             beliefs, whether that decision should really be up to me or\n             not. I don’t know if I could make that decision or if I could\n             be guaranteed that person would be in prison for life.\n             I guess it’s probably primarily justSSjust something within\n             myself that I don’t know if I could do it or not, because\n             I might think that person deserved exactly that, but whether\n             I should be the one here on earth to make that decision.\n\n                                       65\n\f                                   H.\n\n     Webster avers that the court abused its discretion in denying\n\nseveral of his challenges for cause.        He challenged veniremen\n\nDeanna Hailey and Carolyn Coffelt on the ground that they stated\n\nthat if they found Webster guilty of the primary offense of\n\nkidnaping resulting in death, they would have to answer “yes” to\n\nthe statutory aggravating factor that the defendant caused the\n\ndeath of the victim during a kidnaping.     Webster challenged Jimmy\n\nChambless, Kristi Magouirk, and David Hoffman because all allegedly\n\nwere biased in favor of finding him guilty during the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase.      The court denied these challenges, forcing\n\nWebster to use peremptory challenges in all five cases.       He now\n\nsays the denial of his for-cause challenges was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                   1.\n\n     The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial includes the right\n\nto an impartial jury.         Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 727\n\n(1992).    In a capital sentencing context, there is the right to\n\nchallenge for a cause a juror whose views on capital punishment\n\nwould “prevent or substantially impair the performance of his\n\nduties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his\n\noath.”    Witt, 469 U.S. at 424 (quoting Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38,\n\n45 (1980)).    The government has the right to challenge for cause\n\n\n                                   66\n\fthose veniremen whose views in opposition to the death penalty will\n\nsubstantially impair their duty.         Id.   As a corollary, the capital\n\nmurder defendant has a right to challenge for cause any juror who\n\nwill automatically vote for the death penalty in every case,\n\nbecause that juror “will fail in good faith to consider the\n\nevidence    of   aggravating    and   mitigating     circumstances     as   the\n\ninstructions require him to do.”           Hall, 152 F.3d at 407 (quoting\n\nMorgan, 504 U.S. at 729).\n\n      Although Webster complains that the failure to grant his\n\nchallenges for cause forced him to exhaust his peremptory chal-\n\nlenges and, after running out, to take objectionable jurors, he\n\ndoes not allege that any of the jurors who served was not impar-\n\ntial.35 We do not face, therefore, a pure constitutional challenge.\n\nCf. id. at 407-08.36     Rather, we address Webster’s statutory right\n\nto the free exercise of his peremptory challenges as a means of\n\nimplementing the constitutional guarantees.\n\n      “While peremptory challenges, or the number provided by FED.\n\nR. CRIM. P. 24(b) may not be constitutionally required, it does not\n\nfollow that a trial court’s wrongful reduction of the number so\n\n\n\n      35\n        Webster asserts, without substantiation or explanation, only that he was\nforced to take several “questionable” jurors.\n      36\n         The failure properly to grant a challenge for cause rises to the level\nof a constitutional violation and warrants reversal only “if the defendant\nexhausts all peremptory challenges and an incompetent juror is forced upon him.”\nRoss v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 81, 89 (1988). Absent such a showing, the defendant\nhas not been denied his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. Webster has\nmade no claim of incompetent jurors.\n\n                                      67\n\fprovided is not reversible error on direct appeal.”              United States\n\nv. Munoz, 15 F.3d 393, 395 n.1 (5th Cir. 1994).37              “'The denial or\n\nimpairment of the right to exercise peremptory challenges is\n\nreversible error without a showing of prejudice.'”              Hall, 152 F.3d\n\nat 408 (quoting United States v. Broussard, 987 F.2d 215, 221 (5th\n\nCir. 1993)).     Because the district court’s predominant function is\n\ndetermining the credibility of the veniremen, however, “deference\n\nmust be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the prospective\n\njuror.”    Id. at 407 (quoting Witt, 469 U.S. at 426).           “We will only\n\nsecond-guess the court’s decision that a juror is unbiased if there\n\nis an abuse of discretion.”        Id. (quoting Flores, 63 F.3d at 1357).\n\n\n\n                                       2.\n\n                                       a.\n\n      Webster contends that the court should have granted his\n\nchallenge to Deanna Hailey because she automatically would answer\n\n“yes” to one of the statutory aggravating factors if she had found\n\nhim guilty.      Specifically, Hailey said that if she had found a\n\ndefendant guilty of an intentional kidnaping that results in death,\n\nshe   always    would    find   the    statutory    aggravating      factor    of\n\n§ 3592(c)(1) to be true—that the defendant had caused the death\n\n\n\n      37\n        See also United States v. Nell, 526 F.2d 1223, 1229 (5th Cir. 1976) (“[A]s\na general rule it is error for a court to force a party to exhaust his peremptory\nchallenges on persons who should be excused for cause, for this has the effect of\nabridging the right to exercise peremptory challenges.”).\n\n                                       68\n\fduring the commission of the offense.38\n\n     This, Webster argues, runs afoul of Morgan, because Hailey\n\nwould fail to consider additional evidence before finding the\n\nstatutory factor.       In addition, Webster claims, Congress, when it\n\nprovided the aggravating factor, must have contemplated a juror's\n\nconsideration of something more than or different from the evidence\n\nat trial; otherwise, the aggravating factor would be superfluous.\n\nWe disagree; the court did not abuse its discretion in finding\n\nHailey unbiased and capable of serving.\n\n     First, Morgan does not apply here; it holds that a juror\n\nshould be excused if a finding of guilt automatically would lead\n\nhim to recommend a sentence of death.         See Morgan, 504 U.S. at 729.\n\nThe instant alleged error is a far cry from that in Morgan.            The\n\nproblem of which Webster complains is that a finding of guilt\n\nautomatically would lead to the finding of an aggravating fac-\n\ntor—not to a recommendation of death.           An automatic finding of an\n\naggravating factor in no way runs afoul of Morgan’s requirement\n\nthat a juror appears able to “consider the evidence of aggravating\n\nand mitigating circumstances as the instructions require him to\n\ndo,” id., because the automatic finding of an aggravating factor is\n\nnot the same as an inability to consider aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances.       A juror could find the aggravator of kidnaping\n\nresulting in death and yet determine that the mitigating factors\n\n\n     38\n          Hailey actually answered the question, “Yes, I guess so.”\n\n                                       69\n\foutweigh that and other aggravating factors, sparing the defen-\n\ndant’s life.39\n\n      Second, as we held in Jones and Hall, allowing a juror, having\n\nalready found the existence of a certain set of facts beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt during the guilt-innocence phase, to answer “yes”\n\nto an aggravating factor based on the same facts does not raise\n\nconstitutional problems.         See Hall, 152 F.3d at 416-17; Jones,\n\n132 F.3d at 248-49.      Indeed, it merely allows the jury to consider\n\nthe facts or elements of the offense as an aggravating factor that,\n\nhaving already been found beyond a reasonable doubt, it then\n\nweighsSSjust     onceSSin   determining      whether    to   return    a   death\n\nsentence.    Allowing the factor to be weighed does not violate the\n\nnarrow strictures of Morgan, even if a juror believes the finding\n\nof guilt automatically leads to a finding of the factor.\n\n      Finally, Hailey answered Webster’s hypothetical questions in\n\nignorance of the law the court would instruct her to apply.\n\nContrary to Webster’s assertion, she did not implicitly say she\n\nwould not follow instructions; to the contrary, she stated that she\n\nwould be able to follow the instructions and procedures.                     The\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in finding that she would obey\n\nthose instructions when informed how to determine the existence of\n\n\n      39\n         Cf. United States v. McVeigh, 153 F.3d 1166, 1206-08 (10th Cir. 1998)\n(giving Morgan a narrow reach by holding that court need not allow the defense to\nask veniremen Morgan-type questions that include consideration of facts and\ncircumstances beyond a mere finding of guilt automatically leading to a\nrecommendation of death under the FDPA).\n\n\n                                       70\n\faggravating factors.40\n\n\n\n                                           b.\n\n      Webster finds error in the denial of his challenge for cause\n\nto venireman Carolyn “Kay” Coffelt.               Webster believes Coffelt\n\nshould have been excused for the same reason as for Hailey,\n\nalthough      Coffelt    more   ambiguously     answered     that    she   would\n\nautomatically find the first aggravating factor after finding\n\nguilt.41 Coffelt also explicitly stated she would be able to follow\n\nthe instructions and knew there was nothing automatic in assessing\n\nthe death penalty. For the reasons given above, the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion.\n\n\n\n                                           c.\n\n      Webster claims the court should have granted his challenge for\n\ncause of venireman Jimmy Chambless because he was predisposed to\n\nfind Webster guilty.         Chambless, on his own initiative, informed\n\nthe court that he had been exposed to pre-trial publicity, “and\n\nwhat little I know about this, . . . I’m already leaning towards\n\nthe prosecution . . . .          That’s not saying I couldn’t be swayed\n\nwith the evidence and everything that could come up, but I have got\n\n\n\n      40\n        See Hall, 152 F.3d at 410-11 (statements in ignorance of law combined with\naffirmation that venireman will follow instructions allows district court to find\nvenireman competent).\n\n      41\n           Coffelt answered, “Possibly.”\n\n                                           71\n\fto be honest at this point, the defense is not starting even with\n\nthe prosecution.”\n\n     He also stated he leaned toward the prosecution because\n\nWebster had been arrested, and “if someone was arrested for this,\n\nI feel like there was a reason for it . . . .    I feel like there\n\nwas probably a good reason they were arrested. I’m not saying that\n\nI couldn’t, again, be swayed . . . .”   Based on these statements,\n\nWebster believes Chambless should have been excused for cause\n\nbecause he was predisposed to find an arrested defendant guilty and\n\nwould shift the burden of proof onto the defense.      We disagree;\n\nother statements Chambless made demonstrate the court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying the for-cause challenge.\n\n     When questioned by the court, Chambless agreed the verdict\n\nmust be based on the evidence presented in the courtroom, and\n\nbelieved he could limit himself to such evidence.   He affirmed that\n\nthe prosecution carries the burden of proving guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and would require as much with respect to every\n\nelement.   He also believed he could give a fair trial to both the\n\ndefense and the prosecution, putting his predisposition aside. The\n\ncourt found him credible in making these statements and denied the\n\nchallenge for cause.\n\n     “A person is not automatically rendered unqualified to serve\n\nas a juror merely because he has been exposed to media coverage of\n\nthe charged crime. The issue becomes whether exposure to the media\n\npublicity will preclude the individual from returning a verdict\n\n                                72\n\fbased solely on the person’s application of the law as stated to\n\nthe evidence presented.”        Hall, 152 F.3d at 411 (quoting Bell v.\n\nLynaugh, 828 F.2d 1085, 1093 (5th Cir. 1987)).                We “decline to\n\nsecond-guess the district court’s determination, made after face-\n\nto-face credibility       assessment    and   thorough    questioning,     that\n\n[Chambless] could faithfully follow the court’s instructions and\n\nreach a verdict based solely upon the evidence presented at trial.”\n\nId.42\n\n\n\n\n        42\n        See also Bell, 828 F.2d at 1093 (holding that court properly declined to\nstrike venireman for cause in similar circumstances, where pre-trial publicity\npredisposed venireman to find guilt).\n\n                                       73\n\f                                        d.\n\n      Webster contends the court should have granted his challenge\n\nfor cause of venireman Kristi Magouirk for a demonstrated bias\n\nagainst him, an inability to provide a presumption of innocence or\n\nto follow the instructions not to listen to news reports.               During\n\nvoir dire, Magouirk admitted, “I guess I’m more prone to look for\n\nevidence to convict rather than evidence not to convict, reasonable\n\ndoubt.”    She later claimed not to be prone to convict, but “I feel\n\nlike the government must a have good evidence to have this person\n\non trial.”      She expressed her view that black men “have a grudge\n\nagainst me and my race” but asserted that that feeling would not\n\naffect her decision.           She also stated, “I am all for the death\n\npenalty.      I would just as soon see them die for their crime than to\n\nlive out their life on my taxes”; but she explained that she could\n\nrecommend a life sentence without parole.\n\n      Furthermore,       she   later   reiterated    her   preconceptions     of\n\nevidence of guilt because “if the person is charged, they must have\n\ngood evidence.”        She said, “I would like to give him a clean slate.\n\nIt’s just that, to be honest, yes, it’s hard because he’s here\n\n. . . .    So there has got to be something against him.”             She also\n\nrecounted news stories on the crime from as recently as the\n\nprevious day.        It “would be pretty hard” for her not to discuss the\n\ncase with her husband and not to keep up with the press accounts.\n\nDespite Webster’s claims that Magouirk showed bias and an inability\n\nto   follow    the    instructions,    the   court   deemed   her   capable   of\n\n                                        74\n\fserving.     We decline to second-guess that determination.\n\n     The decision is supported by ample evidence that, combined\n\nwith the court’s assessment of Magouirk's credibility, justifies\n\nits refusal to dismiss her for cause.         As explained, knowledge of\n\nthe case from news accounts does not preclude service, and Magouirk\n\nagreed she would follow the instructions to avoid the news, assume\n\nanything she heard outside the courtroom was false, and base her\n\ndecision solely on the evidence.          She recognized that the govern-\n\nment carried the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nShe stated, “I guess, since I haven’t heard any evidence, I don’t\n\nhave anything against him.        So to me he is innocent.   Until I hear\n\nthe facts, then he is innocent, yes.”         She affirmed that she would\n\nfollow her oath as a juror and the court’s instructions, including\n\nnot discussing the case with her husband.         The court acted within\n\nits discretion.\n\n\n\n                                     e.\n\n     Webster claims error in the refusal to grant his challenge for\n\ncause   to   venireman   David    Hoffman.     Webster   believes   Hoffman\n\ndemonstrated bias resulting from Webster's being charged with the\n\noffense and an inability to separate the victim from thoughts of\n\nHoffman's own daughter.          Hoffman testified that, based on news\n\naccounts, he believed a girl named Lisa Rene was kidnaped, taken to\n\nArkansas, and murdered, even though those were the elements the\n\ngovernment would have to prove.           Recognizing the government had\n\n                                     75\n\fbrought charges, he admitted, “I guess for that reason alone I\n\nwould have to say that there’s a certain bias there, or else he\n\nwouldn’t be here.”       Hoffman also stated that he might find it\n\ndifficult to “wall off” thoughts of his daughter during sentencing,\n\nand they might affect his vote “to a certain extent.”\n\n     Hoffman said, however, “I believe that I would be able to\n\nforce [thoughts of my kids from my mind] and weigh purely on the\n\nevidence there.”43    He stated his view that much information coming\n\nfrom the media proved false.         He believed he could keep an open\n\nmind, follow his oath as a juror, and base his verdict and sentence\n\nrecommendation on the evidence and law.\n\n     A juror need not, and indeed cannot, leave his experiences and\n\ncircumstances outside the jury room.          What he must do is base a\n\ndecision solely on the evidence presented, as seen in a fair and\n\nunbiased manner through the lens of his experiences.           The district\n\ncourt found Hoffman excruciatingly honest, but dedicated to and\n\ncapable of overcoming any difficulties he might have as a juror.\n\nOn this cold appellate record, we cannot find that determination an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n\n     43\n         Hoffman demonstrated both the difficulty and, ultimately, his ability\nto make a decision based on the evidence and not on his feelings for his\nchildren:\n\n     Where I feel that I would have a harder time at that—walling that\n     off—is if a guilty verdict is determined and sentencing begins.\n     I would still, again, look at the individual evidence itself and\n     weigh all the circumstances, but just being a human being, I have\n     experiences and feelings, and that’s what makes us all individuals,\n     of course, and those feelings for my children would probably end up\n     coming out in some form in the sentencing.\n\n                                     76\n\f                                        I.\n\n     Before the jury retired for deliberations at the penalty\n\nphase,   the   court   excused    one    of   the   jurors   and   elevated   an\n\nalternate to replace him.        Webster alleges the court erred, but we\n\ndisagree.\n\n\n\n                                        1.\n\n     Webster styles the claim of error as an abuse of discretion in\n\nnot granting a mistrial.     We review a refusal to grant a mistrial\n\nfor abuse of discretion.     United States v. Willis, 6 F.3d 257, 263\n\n(5th Cir. 1993).       But Webster moved for a mistrial because the\n\ncourt had substituted an alternate juror allegedly after the jury\n\nhad retired to consider its verdict.            Under FED. R. CRIM. P. 23(b)\n\nand 24(c), we review a decision to substitute jurors at that late\n\nstage for prejudice.      United Stated v. Huntress, 956 F.2d 1309,\n\n1316 (5th Cir. 1992); United States v. Helms, 897 F.2d 1293\n\n(5th Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n                                        2.\n\n     During the punishment phase, but before the jury had begun\n\ndeliberations, the court excused juror Charles Fox after he came to\n\ncourt in severe pain from an automobile accident.             After extensive\n\ndiscussion with counsel for the defense and prosecution, the court\n\ndecided to substitute Fox with an alternate juror, Christopher\n\n\n                                        77\n\fRawlinson.   Rawlinson had sat through the guilt-innocence phase\n\nbut had neither participated in nor observed those jury delibera-\n\ntions; he also sat through the penalty phase testimony.              Webster\n\nmoved for a mistrial and objected to using an alternate juror; the\n\ncourt ruled against him. In the sentencing phase charge, the court\n\ninstructed the jurors, “As you will recall, a member of the jury\n\nwhich returned the verdict in the guilt phase of the trial was\n\nexcused for health reasons.     An alternate juror was substituted in\n\nhis place.   You are instructed that this substituted juror shall\n\nnot be treated any differently than any other juror during your\n\ndeliberations.”\n\n\n\n                                      3.\n\n     Webster admits the propriety of dismissing Fox. In fact, that\n\ndecision   falls   soundly   within    the   court’s   discretion:     “The\n\ndistrict court has the discretion to remove a juror 'whenever the\n\njudge becomes convinced that the juror’s abilities to perform his\n\nduties becomes impaired.'”      United States v. Leahy, 82 F.3d 624,\n\n629 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting Huntress, 956 F.2d at 1312).            Webster\n\ncomplains only of the lack of authority to replace Fox with an\n\nalternate.\n\n     The court presented the parties with three alternatives:\n\ncontinue with eleven jurors, impanel an alternate, or declare a\n\nmistrial and impanel a new jury.       The court observed that “the law\n\n\n                                      78\n\fisn’t real clear” on how to proceed.         The prospect of repeating the\n\nentire penalty phase hearing made the last alternative highly\n\nunattractive, although that is the alternative Webster urged; he\n\nwould not stipulate to an eleven-member jury.\n\n     If this had taken place before the jury retired at the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase of the trial, the answer to the question would be\n\nsimple, for rule 24(c) provides that “alternate jurors in the order\n\nin which they are called shall replace jurors who, prior to the\n\ntime the jury retires to consider its verdict, become or are found\n\nto be unable or disqualified to perform their duties.” Rule 24(c)\n\nalso states, however, that all alternate jurors who have not\n\nreplaced a regular juror “shall be discharged after the jury\n\nretires to consider its verdict.”          Id.\n\n     When a juror is disqualified after the jury retires, on the\n\nother hand, the court has the authority to require the jury to\n\nproceed to verdict with only eleven members, with or without\n\nstipulation by the parties, and this should be done particularly in\n\nlengthy and complicated trials.44         We have explained our justifica-\n\ntion for proceeding with eleven jurors instead of substituting an\n\nalternate:\n\n     An alternate juror replacing a regular juror after the\n     jury has commenced its deliberations may be unable to\n     participate equally with the other jurors, because he\n\n\n     44\n         See FED. R. CRIM. P. 23(b); Huntress, 956 F.2d at 1317 (“We wish to\nemphasize that district judges in this circuit should follow Rule 23(b) rather\nthan substitute alternate jurors when a juror is excused after deliberations\nbegin.”).\n\n                                     79\n\f      will lack the benefit of prior deliberations. There is\n      a danger that the other jurors will have already formu-\n      lated positions or viewpoints or opinions in the absence\n      of the alternate juror and then pressure the newcomer\n      into possibly ratifying this predetermined verdict, thus\n      denying the defendant the right to consideration of the\n      case by twelve jurors.\n\nUnited States v. Quiroz-Cortez, 960 F.2d 418, 420 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\n      The complication in the instant case, of course, is the\n\nbifurcated trial. The FDPA provides that if the defendant is found\n\nguilty, the court\n\n      shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine\n      the punishment to be imposed.     The hearing shall be\n      conductedSS\n\n      (1) before the jury that determined the defendant’s guilt;\n\n      (2) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of the hearing\n      ifSS\n\n      ...\n\n            (C)    the jury that determined the defendants guilt\n                   was discharged for good cause\n\n            . . . .\n\n      A jury impaneled pursuant to paragraph (2) shall consist\n      of 12 members, unless, at any time before the conclusion\n      of the hearing, the parties stipulate, with approval of\n      the court, that it shall consist of a lesser number.\n\n§ 3593(b).45      How should a court apply rules 23 and 24, if at all,\n\n\n      45\n         This language allowing for the parties to stipulate to a jury of less\nthan 12 members is similar to former rule 23(b), which did not allow the court\nto order the case to proceed even absent stipulations.         Before changes to\nrule 23(b) in 1983, caselaw allowed a court to substitute an alternate juror even\nwhen deliberations had begun, if the parties refused to stipulate to a jury of\nfewer than 12 members. See United States v. Phillips, 664 F.2d 971, 996 (Former\n5th Cir. Dec. 1981); FED. R. CRIM. P. 23(b), advisory committee note. In such a\ncase, the defendant had to show he was prejudiced by the use of the alternate\njuror. See Huntress, 956 F.2d at 1316.\n\n                                       80\n\fwhen the jury has returned from deciding one verdict but has yet to\n\nretire to consider the second?     This presents an issue of first\n\nimpression.\n\n     The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure apply to sentencing\n\nhearings; FED. R. CRIM. P. 1 provides, “These rules govern the\n\nprocedure in all criminal proceedings in the courts of the United\n\nStates . . . .”     Rule 54, FED. R. CRIM. P., excludes certain\n\nproceedings, but not sentencing hearings.    Section 3593(c) waives\n\nrule 32(c)’s presentence report requirement, which suggests the\n\nnegative implication that the Rules of Criminal Procedure usually\n\ndo apply to sentencing hearings under the FDPA. The district court\n\ncorrectly looked at rules 23 and 24, therefore, in deciding what to\n\ndo after excusing Fox.   But how should a court apply these rules in\n\nlight of the fact that they fail to contemplate a bifurcated\n\nproceeding?\n\n     If, hypothetically, the entire jury had been discharged for\n\ngood cause after returning its guilty verdict, the court would have\n\nimpaneled an entirely new one pursuant to § 3593(b)(2).     Presum-\n\nably, that jury would have included alternates.   If the court then\n\nhad discharged a juror for cause before the jury had retired to\n\nconsider the sentence, would the court have been entitled to\n\nelevate an alternate?     Rule 24(c) answers in the affirmative\n\n(alternate “shall replace” juror excused before jury retires).\n\n     The superficial conclusion, then, is that the court has the\n\nsame authority to impanel an alternate when the same jury sits for\n\n                                 81\n\fboth phases of the trial.        And this conclusion answers Webster’s\n\nprimary contention:       Because an alternate was available and the\n\njury had not retired to deliberate on its sentence recommendation,\n\nthe court had the authority, under rule 24(c), to elevate the\n\nalternate.\n\n       The answer, unfortunately, is not so facile, for rule 24(c)\n\nalso provides, “An alternate juror who does not replace a regular\n\njuror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider its\n\nverdict.”       This mandatory language appears to compel the court to\n\ndismiss the alternate jurors once the jury retires at the end of\n\nthe first phaseSSwhen the jury first retires to consider its\n\nverdict.       If the court were to follow this mandatory language, no\n\nalternates would remain to be substituted for jurors whom the court\n\nmight have to discharge before the end of the second phase.46                In\n\nfact, the court dismissed three of the five alternate jurors; the\n\nremaining two were retained for the penalty phase of the hearings.\n\n       The court erred in not dismissing the juror at the end of the\n\nfirst phase.       The mandatory language of rule 24(c) requires the\n\ncourt to dismiss the alternates when the jury retires to deliber-\n\nate.        This conclusion adheres faithfully to the language of the\n\nrules.\n\n       Nevertheless, we affirm the sentence.         Webster did not object\n\n\n\n       46\n         Webster points out that when the jury was first impaneled, the court\ninstructed that “once the deliberations begin, we will dismiss any alternate who\nhas not been seated as a primary juror.”\n\n                                      82\n\fto the failure to dismiss the alternates at the time; he complained\n\nonly of elevating an alternate to the jury and not granting a\n\nmistrial.47     Because the jury had not retired when the court\n\ndismissed Fox and substituted Rawlinson, any available alternate\n\ncould be elevated consistent with the rule.              Webster, therefore,\n\nwaived the objection he should have madeSSthe failure to dismiss\n\nthe alternates.       When the defendant has waived an objection for\n\nfailure to follow the substitution rules, an error alone does not\n\nwarrant reversal; we also review for prejudice from the resulting\n\nelevation of the substitute.48\n\n      Webster did not suffer prejudice. The court provided the jury\n\nwith an instruction to include the new juror equally in all\n\ndeliberations.     Furthermore, the jury had not started deliberating\n\nat the penalty phase.           Those issues were distinct from those\n\ndecided at the guilt-innocence phase; any overlap is irrelevant,\n\nbecause the jury specifically was instructed to consider everything\n\nas if for the first time.       Interestingly, on the sole penalty phase\n\nissue as to which prejudice seems possible, which is in the first\n\naggravating factor that overlapped with the offense decided in the\n\nfirst phaseSSkidnaping in which death resultsSSthe jury failed to\n\n\n\n      47\n         On appeal, Webster focuses on the same complaint.    In some places,\nhowever, he mentions the failure to dismiss the alternates when deliberations\nbegan at the guilt-innocence phase.\n\n      48\n        See Huntress, 956 F.2d at 1316-17 (holding that failure to make the proper\nobjection to violation of juror rules leads to review for prejudice in the\nsubstitution).\n\n                                       83\n\ffind the aggravating factor. Webster’s generic claims of prejudice\n\nfail, as there is nothing inherently prejudicial in a rule 24(c)\n\nviolation.   See Huntress, 956 F.2d at 1316 n.7.\n\n\n\n                                J.\n\n     Webster contends that the court erred in excusing juror Urbano\n\nGomez on learning that, in response to the juror questionnaire, he\n\nhad not disclosed past encounters with the judicial system.   At the\n\nvery least, Webster claims, the court erred by not recalling Gomez\n\nto ask him further questions.   We conclude the court acted within\n\nits discretion by dismissing Gomez, even absent further questioning\n\nto determine whether he had lied.\n\n\n\n\n                                84\n\f                                        1.\n\n      After the court qualified Gomez as a juror, the prosecutor\n\nnotified the court that it had uncovered a criminal record for him.\n\nThe government challenged Gomez for cause because he had not\n\nanswered his questionnaire truthfully.             The government presented\n\nevidence that Gomez had been charged with shoplifting and spent\n\nthree days in county jail, had been convicted of aggravated assault\n\non a police officer and received one month of confinement,49 and had\n\nbeen convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for which\n\nhe received five years' probation.           None of these was mentioned in\n\nGomez's answer to the questionnaire.50 Over defense objections, the\n\ncourt dismissed Gomez for providing false information, without\n\nrecalling him for questioning.\n\n\n\n                                        2.\n\n      The court has discretion to excuse an untruthful juror.51                The\n\n      49\n         The parties agree this must have been pled down to some lesser offense,\ngiven the punishment.\n\n      50\n         The most evident problem is with the response to Question 73, “Have you or\na relative been convicted of any offense other than a traffic ticket?” Gomez\nchecked “Yes,” and under “details” noted “brother-in-law, child abuse.” Five other\nquestions were answered inaccurately, given Gomez's record of arrests, convictions,\nand probation.\n\n      51\n         United States v. Fryar, 867 F.2d 850, 853 (5th Cir. 1989); United States\nv. Coleman, 997 F.2d 1101, 1105 (5th Cir. 1993) (“A trial judge may 'remove a juror\nwhenever the judge becomes convinced that the juror’s abilities to perform his\nduties have become impaired.'”) (quoting United States v. Dominguez, 615 F.2d 1093,\n1095 (5th Cir. 1980)). Webster argues that mere abuse of discretion review provides\ninsufficient protection to a capital defendant and that the heightened need for\nreliability in capital cases should compel us to examine errors with greater\nscrutiny. He provides no authority for this claim, and we see no reason to depart\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                        85\n\fscope of the examination, if any, into juror misconduct rests\n\nwithin the court’s sound discretion.

We find no clear error in the court's acceptance of the\n\ngovernment's non-racial justifications for the strikes.\n\n\n\n                                         1.\n\n      After voir dire, the court presented the parties with a list\n\nof sixty potential jurors, of whom five were black and one was\n\nAsian.53       Each side exercised its twenty challenges.                 Webster\n\n\n      51\n           (...continued)\nfrom the ordinary standard of review.\n\n      52\n         See also Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.S. 182, 189 (1981) (district\ncourt has broad discretion in determining how best to conduct voir dire).\n\n      53\n            There also were several hispanics whom the government did not strike.\n\n                                         86\n\fobjected to the government’s strikes eliminating the Asian and the\n\nfive blacks. To establish his prima facie case of racial discrimi-\n\nnation, Webster relied solely on the fact that the government had\n\nstricken all black jurors.     The court questioned whether this made\n\nout a prima facie case, but nonetheless called on the government to\n\nprovide rationales for its strikes.\n\n     The government provided race-neutral rationales.             Webster\n\nfiled a motion disputing those reasons for each of the black\n\njurors.54    Webster argued the reasons were a pretext and that the\n\nprosecution did not strike other similarly-situated jurors who were\n\nnot black. The government filed a response explaining why it found\n\nthe jurors Webster claimed to be similarly situated were in fact\n\ndifferent.\n\n     The court entered an order denying Webster’s Batson motion,\n\nfinding that (1) the motion was untimely; (2) Webster had failed to\n\nmake out a prima facie case; (3) the government’s race-neutral\n\nreasons were believable; and (4) Webster had failed to prove\n\npurposeful discrimination.      We affirm on the latter two grounds.\n\n\n\n                                    2.\n\n     “The use of peremptory challenges to exclude veniremen 'solely\n\non account' of race violates the equal protection component of the\n\n\n\n      54\n         Webster conceded a legitimate reason existed for the Asian jurorSS\ndifficulty with the English language.\n\n                                    87\n\fdue process clause of the fifth amendment.”          United States v.\n\nTerrazas Carrosco, 861 F.2d 93, 94 (5th Cir. 1988).

First, the\n\nclaimant must make a prima facie showing that the peremptory\n\nchallenges have been exercised on the basis of race.        Second, if\n\nthis requisite showing has been made, the burden shifts to the\n\nparty   accused   of   discrimination   to    articulate   race-neutral\n\nexplanations for the peremptory challenges.         Finally, the trial\n\ncourt must determine whether the claimant has carried his burden of\n\nproving purposeful discrimination.”          United States v.

The party making the\n\nclaim of purposeful discrimination bears the ultimate burden of\n\npersuasion.   Bentley-Smith, 2 F.3d at 1373.\n\n     We assume, arguendo, that Webster timely made his Batson\n\nmotion and that he made a prima facie case.        The court called on\n\nthe government to provide race-neutral justifications for the use\n\nof its peremptory strikes.   Once a court has taken that step, we no\n\n\n\n\n                                  88\n\flonger examine whether a prima facie case exits.55                 Our decision,\n\nthen, must rest on (1) whether the government articulated race-\n\nneutral    explanations      for   the   exercise    of    its   challenges    and\n\n(2) whether Webster has demonstrated that those justifications are\n\npre-textual and that the government engaged in purposeful discrimi-\n\nnation.\n\n\n\n                                         a.\n\n      Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the explanation,\n\nthe reason offered should be deemed race-neutral.

Huey,\n\n76 F.3d at 640-41; Fields, 72 F.3d at 1206.\n\n      The government offered reasons for excusing each of the five\n\njurors, with concerns ranging from a juror's establishing a rapport\n\nwith defense counsel to a fear that none of the five would be able\n\nto   recommend    a   death    sentence     when   the    time   came,   and    from\n\nrelatives with criminal records to relatives living in the city\n\nwhere the murder took place.

Having reviewed the record, we cannot say the court\n\nclearly erred.\n\n\n\n                                        b.\n\n      At the third stage of the inquiry, Webster bears the burden of\n\nestablishing that the government engaged in “purposeful discrimina-\n\ntion” based on race.          Purkett, 514 U.S. at 767; Bentley-Smith,\n\n2 F.3d at 1373 (“The ultimate burden of persuasion always lies with\n\nthe party making the claim of purposeful discrimination.”).

Garcia,    1    F.3d   330,    335   (5th   Cir.   1993)     (quoting\n\nHernandez, 500 U.S. at 360).          Webster fails to meet this burden.\n\n\n                                        90\n\f      Webster offers no direct evidence of purposeful discrimina-\n\ntion, but rather argues that the government’s proffered reasons are\n\npretextual, and the government did not dismiss similar white\n\njurors.56   Because the determination turns on credibility assess-\n\nments, we review for clear error at this stage as well.                Bentley-\n\nSmith, 2 F.3d at 1373; United States v. Seals, 987 F.2d 1102, 1109\n\n(5th Cir. 1993).\n\n      The government offered distinguishing characteristics for each\n\nof the jurors Webster claims were similarly situated.                 They had\n\ndifferent combinations of qualities, and some had more government-\n\ndesired qualities than did the jurors the government preempted.\n\nSee United States v. Jimenez, 77 F.3d 95, 100-01 (5th Cir. 1996)\n\n(other redeeming qualities relevant). Although Webster asserts the\n\nproffered reasons for striking the black jurors are mere proxies\n\nfor race, he provides no basis as to why; and the reasons resemble\n\nones we have accepted in the past.57           The court did not find the\n\nproffered    reasons    pretextual    and   found    no   other   evidence    of\n\npurposeful discrimination; we cannot say it clearly erred.\n\n      56\n         See Bentley-Smith, 2 F.3d at 1374 (noting difficulty of bringing forward\nsuch evidence, and frequent necessity of relying on rebuttal of proffered reasons\nand comparison to jurors not stricken).\n\n      57\n         See, e.g., United States v.

Webster claims this\n\nlimitation violated his due process rights.               We find no error.\n\n      Webster styles his claim of error as a due process violation.\n\nDue process requires a fair opportunity to defend against the\n\ncharges, including calling and cross-examining witnesses; keeping\n\ninformation, including witnesses, from the jury may violate due\n\nprocess.     See, e.g., Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37 (1996);\n\nChambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 294 (1973); Washington v.\n\nTexas, 388 U.S. 14, 23 (1967).           “Just as an accused has the right\n\nto   confront    the    prosecution’s      witnesses     for   the   purpose     of\n\nchallenging their testimony, he has the right to present his own\n\nwitnesses to establish a defense.              This right is a fundamental\n\nelement of due process of law.”                 United States v. Thompson,\n\n130 F.3d 676, 686 (5th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 2307\n\n(1998).\n\n      We never have intimated, however, that this due process right\n\nextends to presenting witnesses at surrebuttal. Indeed, we know of\n\nonly two published opinions that have addressed limitations on\n\nsurrebuttal in a due process context.58            Even assuming surrebuttal\n\n\n      58\n         See United States v. Clark, 617 F.2d 180, 183, 187 (9th Cir. 1980)\n(recognizing as due process claim, but treating under abuse of discretion standard);\nUnited States v. One Single Family Residence Located at 15526 69th Drive N., 778 F.\nSupp. 1215, 1219 (S.D. Fla. 1991) (finding due process violation for a complete\ndenial of surrebuttal).\n\n                                        92\n\fimplicates due process concerns, we cannot say that the court’s\n\nlimitation of Webster’s surrebuttal to one of two expert witnesses\n\nwhom the court considered cumulative was so arbitrary and fundamen-\n\ntally unfair as to deprive him of due process.59\n\n\n\n\n                                         M.\n\n      After entering a sentence of death on the verdict, the court\n\nfiled a finding entitled Factual Finding Regarding Mental Retarda-\n\ntion in which the court stated, “Webster is not mentally retarded\n\nand . . . he possesses the requisite mental capacity to understand\n\nthe death penalty and why it will be imposed on him.              As a result,\n\nthe defendant Webster is not exempt under 18 U.S.C. § 3596(c) from\n\nimplementation of the death penalty.”60            Webster objects to this\n\nfinding on several grounds:            (1) It was made in contravention of\n\n\n      59\n         Typically, we review the decision to permit or deny surrebuttal under\nthe abuse of discretion standard. See, e.g., United States v. Alford, 999 F.2d\n818, 821 (5th Cir. 1993); United States v. Moody, 903 F.2d 321, 330 (5th Cir.\n1990).   The Ninth Circuit has examined a due process claim under the same\nstandard.   See Clark, 617 F.2d at 187.     Under this standard, too, limiting\nsurrebuttal that the district court considers cumulative rests soundly within its\ndiscretion. See, e.g., United States v. O’Brien, 119 F.3d 523, 531 (7th Cir.\n1997) (no abuse of discretion where surrebuttal would be cumulative); United\nStates v. Blackstone, 56 F.3d 1143, 1146 (9th Cir. 1995) (same); United States\nv. Wilford, 710 F.2d 439, 452 (8th Cir. 1982) (same); United States v. Burgess,\n691 F.2d 523, 531 n.19 (4th Cir. 1982) (same); United States v. Stirling,\n571 F.2d 708, 736 (2d Cir. 1978) (same).\n      60\n           Section 3596(c) provides,\n\n      A sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a person who is\n      mentally retarded. A sentence of death shall not be carried out\n      upon a person who, as a result of mental disability, lacks the\n      mental capacity to understand the death penalty and why it was\n      imposed on that person.\n\n                                         93\n\fthe FDPA; (2) it was made in derogation of Webster’s rights to due\n\nprocess and effective assistance of counsel; (3) it was contrary to\n\nthe greater weight of the credible evidence; and (4) it was\n\ninconsistent with the verdict on this issue.61 We conclude that the\n\ncourt took proper action, and the finding was supported by the\n\nevidence.\n\n      Webster failed to object to the factual finding.            Our review,\n\ntherefore, is limited to plain error.          United States v. Calverley,\n\n37 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc).            To find plain error,\n\nwe must perceive (1) an error by district court, in that it\n\ndeviated from a legal rule, (2) that was clear and, at a minimum,\n\nobvious under current law at the time of the trial, and (3) the\n\nerror must affect substantial rights.          Id. at 162-63.\n\n\n\n                                      1.\n\n      Webster alleges the factual finding was in contravention of\n\nthe FDPA’s statutory scheme, but the statute fails to address how\n\nto ensure that the mandate of § 3596(c) is carried out.                Because\n\nthe statute fails to provide guidance, and no case has addressed\n\nthis issue, the law is not pellucid; the court did not plainly err\n\nin its sua sponte finding that Webster is not mentally retarded.\n\n\n      61\n         Webster intimates that imposing the death sentence on him, if he is\nmentally retarded, would violate the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court has\nrejected this argument. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 340 (1989) (“[W]e\ncannot hold today that the Eighth Amendment precludes the execution of any\nmentally retarded person . . . simply by virtue of his or her mental retardation\nalone.”).\n\n                                      94\n\f     Webster argues that the statute provides sufficient guidance.\n\nWe disagree.         Webster points to § 3593(b)(3), which provides that\n\nthe court will act as a fact-finder “upon the motion of the\n\ndefendant and with the approval of the attorney for the govern-\n\nment.” Webster interprets this to preclude any fact-finding by the\n\ncourt absent the defendant’s motion. The conclusion, however, does\n\nnot flow from the statute.\n\n     Section 3593(b) provides that “the judge who presided at the\n\ntrial    .   .   .     shall   conduct    a    separate    sentencing     hearing   to\n\ndetermine        the    punishment       imposed.         The   hearing    shall    be\n\nconducted . . . (3) before the court alone, upon the motion of the\n\ndefendant and with the approval of the attorney for the govern-\n\nment.”       This provision refers only to the determination of the\n\nsentence; it is located in the section captioned “Special hearing\n\nto determine whether a sentence of death is justified.”                     It in no\n\nway implies that all court fact-finding must be on the defendant’s\n\nmotion.\n\n     Webster also asserts that, in the absence of a specific\n\nstatutory scheme, the only logical conclusion is that the jury must\n\nbe the fact-finder on the issue of mental retardation.                             This\n\n“logical” claim suffers from gaps in reasoning.\n\n     First, only §§ 3592 and 3593 address issues that a jury may be\n\ncalled on to consider.           Section 3592 lays out all of the factors\n\nfor the finder of fact to considerSSthe mitigating and aggravating\n\nfactors.      Section 3593 explains the procedure for the sentencing\n\n                                              95\n\fhearing, including laying out the options for who the fact-finder\n\nmay beSSjury, newly impaneled jury, or judge.\n\n       Section   3596   addresses   “Implementation        of   a   sentence   of\n\ndeath.” It is here that Congress chose to indicate its restriction\n\non who could be executed.          Placement of the consideration here,\n\nrather than in the earlier sections addressing the issues for the\n\njury   to   consider    in   imposing    the   sentence,    belies    Webster’s\n\nassertion that the issue obviously belongs to the jury.\n\n       In   addition,   although    Webster     did   request       and   receive\n\nsubmission of the mitigating factor that he “is or may be mentally\n\nretarded,” he did not request a jury instruction that placed in the\n\njury's hands the job of factually finding whether Webster is\n\nmentally retarded.       That the jury could consider whether Webster\n\n“is or may be retarded” falls woefully short of the factual finding\n\nrequired in § 3596 of mental retardation to prevent the implementa-\n\ntion of the death sentence.             The lack of a jury instruction\n\nrequest, along with failing to object to the factual finding,\n\nsuggests that Webster’s “logical assumption” placing this issue in\n\nthe jury’s hands was no more obvious to him at trial than it was to\n\nthe district court.\n\n       The statutory scheme simply does not answer who decides this\n\nissue, so we cannot say the court’s decision clearly contravened\n\nthe FDPA.     Given the lack of clarity, the court did not commit\n\nplain error in deciding the issue itself.\n\n\n\n                                        96\n\f                                      2.\n\n      Webster asserts that the procedure the court chose violated\n\ndue process and deprived him of effective assistance of counsel.\n\nNeither is true.       Webster rests these claims on the fact that the\n\ncourt acted without statutory authority and without notice to him.\n\nBare assertions aside, Webster provides no analysis as to why the\n\ncourt’s determination violates the Constitution.\n\n      The    alleged    denial   of   effective    assistance    of   counsel\n\npresumably rests on Webster’s lack of opportunity to present his\n\ncase.      Even assuming this rises to the level of constitutional\n\nerror, it is harmless.           Webster had just finished presenting\n\nvoluminous evidence to the jury, in support of his claim of mental\n\nretardation.62    The court had ample information before it to make\n\nits decision; indeed, just before the jury retired, Webster had\n\nasked the court to find him mentally retarded as a matter of law,\n\ntaking the mitigating factor out of the jury’s hands.                 Webster\n\nmakes no showing of prejudice to his substantial rights by arguing\n\nthere is something additional he would have presented to the court.\n\nThe court did not plainly err in failing to provide Webster with\n\nnotice, and did not deprive him of a fundamentally fair trial.\n\n\n\n                                      3.\n\n\n      62\n         Cf. United States v. Bachynsky, 949 F.2d 722, 732-33 (5th Cir. 1991)\n(holding that sentencing court cannot base decision on matters outside of\npresentence report without notice to defendant to provide “ample opportunity to\nraise his factual contention.”).\n\n                                      97\n\f      Webster contends that the finding that he is not mentally\n\nretarded is against the greater weight and credibility of the\n\nevidence.   The standard of review for a finding that a defendant is\n\nnot mentally retarded under § 3596 presents an issue of first\n\nimpression.    Because it is a factual finding, we adopt the clearly\n\nerroneous standard.63\n\n      The government presented substantial evidence to support the\n\nfinding.    Furthermore, only four of the twelve jurors found that\n\nWebster is or may be mentally retard and that he suffers from low\n\nintellectual functioning. We cannot say the court clearly erred in\n\ndeciding that Webster is not mentally retarded.\n\n\n\n                                     4.\n\n      Webster contends that the court’s determination conflicts with\n\nthe verdict on this issue.      Webster fails to indicate the import of\n\nthis argument, aside from supporting his claim of a constitutional\n\nviolation and his assertion that the finding contradicts the\n\ngreater weight of the evidence.\n\n      Only four of twelve jurors concluded Webster “is or may be\n\nmentally retarded.”      Webster’s failure to convince a majority of\n\nthe jurors alone suggests the court’s finding is not inconsistent\n\nwith the verdict.     Furthermore, those four jurors found only that\n\nhe is or may be mentally retarded.            Obviously, this mitigating\n\n      63\n        Cf. United States v. Kimbrough, 69 F.3d 723, 733 (5th Cir. 1995) (noting\nthat we review factual findings in examining a sentence imposed for clear error).\n\n                                     98\n\ffactor requires less certainty than does the determination that he\n\nis not mentally retarded.\n\n     As a result of this lesser standard, we can conclude that\n\neight jurors were not convinced that he even “may be” mentally\n\nretarded; they believed he was not.   We cannot conclude that the\n\ncourt’s agreement with a majority of the jurors constitutes a\n\nclear, obvious error.\n\n\n\n                                N.\n\n     Webster argues that the evidence does not support the special\n\nfindings of the existence of the aggravating factors and that the\n\nsentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion,\n\nprejudice, or some other arbitrary factor.   This contention stems\n\ndirectly from the FDPA’s requirement that a court of appeals “shall\n\nconsider whether the sentence of death was imposed under the\n\ninfluence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and\n\nwhether the evidence supports the special finding of the existence\n\nof an aggravating factor required to be considered under section\n\n3592.”   § 3595(c)(1).\n\n     Webster fails to distinguish between these two requirements as\n\ndistinct responsibilities of an appellate court.        Rather, he\n\nsuggests that the only way we can fulfill our responsibility under\n\nthe provision as a whole is to conduct “a de novo review and a\n\nbalancing of the evidence.” Any other method, Webster claims, will\n\n\n\n                                99\n\ffail to ferret out which verdicts were imposed under the impermis-\n\nsible factors.64 An appellate court, however, is a court of review.\n\nWe do not sit as a second jury.           Instead, we will address the two\n\naspects of our review in turn.          See Hall, 152 F.3d 426 (addressing\n\neach in turn, rather than engaging in one unified, de novo review).\n\n\n\n                                        1.\n\n      First, we must determine whether the evidence supports the\n\njury’s special findings of the aggravating factors.                  The statute\n\ndoes not clarify what standard of review we should use.                Nothing in\n\nthe FDPA, however, indicates that it alters our ordinary standards\n\nof review.65      To protect the jury’s domain, we apply the usual\n\nstandard of sufficiency of the evidence.66\n\n      “Review for sufficiency of the evidence is decidedly narrowSSa\n\n[finding of an aggravating factor] must be affirmed if a rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found that the evidence established the\n\nessential elements of [its existence] beyond a reasonable doubt.”67\n\n      64\n         Webster also suggests this requires a proportionality review; we see no\nbasis in the statute for such an assertion.\n      65\n         See United States v. Chandler, 996 F.2d 1073, 1083 (11th Cir. 1993)\n(holding similar provision of 21 U.S.C. § 848(q)(3) does not alter ordinary\nstandards of review).\n\n      66\n        See Hall, 152 F.3d at 426 (finding “the record contains ample evidence from\nwhich the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt” that the aggravating\nfactors existed).\n\n      67\n         United States v. Ramirez, 145 F.3d 345, 350 (5th Cir. 1998), petition for\ncert. filed (Sept. 28, 1998) (No. 98-6687); United States v. Cluck, 143 F.3d 174,\n180 (5th Cir. 1998) (noting that “we review the evidence in the light most favorable\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                        100\n\fIn view of this record, a rational jury could find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that all four remaining aggravating factors exist.\n\n\n\n                                       2.\n\n      Our next responsibility is to ensure that the sentence was not\n\nhanded down under the influence of passion, prejudice, or some\n\nother arbitrary factor.         Again, Webster asserts this requires a\n\nde novo re-weighing of the evidence, for any other assessment will\n\nfail to negate the possibility that arbitrary factors were at work.\n\n      We question whether this is an accurate statement of our\n\nresponsibility under the FDPA.68             We need not decide this issue\n\ntoday, however, for we have already conducted a thorough re-\n\nexamination of the aggravating and mitigating factors in part\n\nIV.A.1.c, supra, as part of our harmless error review.              We also see\n\nnothing in the record indicating that the sentence was imposed\n\nunder the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\n\nfactor.       The death sentence is warranted by the jury’s specific\n\nfindings.\n\n\n\n                                       O.\n\n      Webster launches a variety of attacks on the constitutionality\n\n\n      67\n           (...continued)\nto the jury verdict”), petition for cert. filed (Sept. 26, 1998).\n\n      68\n         See Hall, 152 F.3d at 426 (stating that “[w]e have found nothing in the\nrecord indicating that the jury’s recommendation of a death sentence was motivated\nin any degree by passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor”).\n\n                                       101\n\fof the FDPA.       We entertained and rejected most of these arguments\n\nin the past, see Hall, 152 F.3d at 413-19; Jones, 132 F.3d at 239-\n\n42,    foreclosing     our   reconsideration       of   them   today.69      Those\n\narguments that we have not heard in the past we consider de novo.\n\nSee United States v. Bailey, 115 F.3d 1222, 1225 (5th Cir. 1997),\n\ncert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 866 (1998).\n\n\n\n                                        1.\n\n       Webster’s constitutional challenges that we have addressed in\n\nthe past      we    deal   with   expeditiously.        Contrary    to   Webster’s\n\narguments, (1) the FDPA provides sufficient safeguards to prevent\n\nthe arbitrary imposition of the death penalty, Jones, 132 F.3d at\n\n241;    (2)   the     FDPA   sufficiently    circumscribes         its   delegated\n\nauthority with 'intelligible principles' to avoid violating the\n\nnondelegation doctrine, id. at 239; (3) the Constitution does not\n\nmandate “proportionality review,” that is, a comparison of the\n\npenalties imposed in similar cases, id. at 240; (4) the FDPA’s\n\nrelaxed evidentiary standard at the sentencing hearing is not\n\nunconstitutional, id. at 241-42; (5) the “especially heinous, cruel\n\nor depraved manner” aggravating factor is not impermissibly vague,\n\nat least where the vagueness is cured by the statutory limitation\n\nthat the offense involve torture or serious physical abuse and by\n\n\n       69\n        See Garcia Abrego, 141 F.3d at 151 n.1 (“It has long been the rule of this\ncourt that no panel of this circuit can overrule a decision previously made by\nanother.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                       102\n\ffurther limitation in the jury instructions, id. at 249; Hall,\n\n152 F.3d at 414-15;70 and (6) the FDPA’s inclusion of the “mere\n\nfact” that Webster was convicted of kidnaping and murdering Lisa\n\nRene as an aggravating factor does not constitute constitutionally\n\nimpermissible “stacking,” or double-counting, Jones, 132 F.3d at\n\n249; Hall, 152 F.3d at 416-17.71\n\n\n\n                                      2.\n\n      Webster raises three constitutional arguments that we address\n\nas matters of first impression.         We reject them seriatim.\n\n\n\n                                      a.\n\n      Webster argues that the FDPA is unconstitutional for failing\n\nsignificantly to narrow the class of offenses to which the death\n\npenalty applies. Under Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 363-64\n\n(1988), the government may not make every unjustified intentional\n\nkilling qualify for the death penalty.             The FDPA does precisely\n\nthat, Webster argues, by making the four mental states of murder\n\naggravating    factors     that   qualify    the   defendant     for   capital\n\npunishment under § 3591(a).           Webster’s argument stems from a\n\n\n      70\n         Webster also asserts, without analysis, that the “substantial planning\nand premeditation” aggravator is impermissibly vague. His argument is foreclosed\nby our analysis of the same language in the analogous 21 U.S.C. § 848(e) death\npenalty scheme. See Flores, 63 F.3d at 1373-74.\n      71\n         Further, because the jury did not find the aggravator of which Webster\ncomplains, he cannot claim his sentence is impaired.\n\n                                      103\n\fmisreading of the statute.\n\n     As the government points out, § 3591(a) does not set forth a\n\nlist of   aggravating       factors,    but,       on   the   contrary,   serves a\n\ngatekeeping function.         Section 3591(a) codifies the command in\n\nEnmund, 458 U.S. at 797, and Tison, 481 U.S. at 157, to limit the\n\nimposition   of    the    death   penalty     to    those     murderers   who   both\n\nundertake felony participation and demonstrate at least reckless\n\nindifference to human life.           Satisfaction of these elements only\n\nbegins the death penalty inquiry; it does not and cannot establish\n\ndeath penalty eligibility by itself.               The limiting factors, which\n\nWebster   claims    are    lacking,    are,    of       course,   the   aggravating\n\ncircumstances set forth in § 3592(b) and (c), which guide the jury\n\nin its capital decision after it finds at least one element of\n\nintent under § 3591(a) as a threshold matter.\n\n\n\n                                       b.\n\n     Webster contends that the FDPA is unconstitutional because it\n\npermits the multiple weighing of aggravating factors (specifically,\n\nthe § 3591(a)(2) mens rea factors).            This argument stems from the\n\nsame fundamental misunderstanding of § 3591(a) discussed above. See\n\npart IV.N.2.a, supra; see also part IV.A.2, supra (discussing\n\n“double weighing”).       As we have explained, § 3591(a) does not set\n\nforth aggravating factors, but rather serves as a preliminary\n\nqualification threshold.          The fact that a defendant could satisfy\n\n\n                                       104\n\fmore than one of these via the same course of action does not,\n\ntherefore,      constitute    impermissible      double    counting.      Thus,\n\nalthough Webster is correct in noting that many courts have held\n\nthat “double counting” of aggravating factors is to be avoided, the\n\nFDPA does not present such a problem.72\n\n\n\n                                       c.\n\n       Webster asserts that by precluding consideration of “race,\n\ncolor, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant\n\nor of any victim” as a mitigating factor, the FDPA is unconstitu-\n\ntional. See § 3593(f). Webster correctly interprets the FDPA, but\n\nincorrectly interprets the Constitution; the FDPA can be constitu-\n\ntional only by precluding such factors.\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause protects from purposeful state\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.          Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630,\n\n642 (1993). The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides\n\nthis   same    “equal   protection”    against    the     federal   government.\n\nBolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498-500 (1954).               Court proceed-\n\nings, especially criminal trials, implicate state action, therefore\n\nbringing      them   under   equal   protection    scrutiny.        Georgia   v.\n\nMcCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 49-55 (1992); Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete\n\nCo., 500 U.S. 614, 621-29 (1991).\n\n\n\n      72\n         As we have said in part IV.A.2, supra, the instructions sufficiently\ninformed the jury not to weigh the elements of intent.\n\n                                      105\n\f      More specifically, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits the\n\nstate from using race in its decision-making, unless it can meet\n\nthe “most exacting scrutiny . . . justified by a compelling\n\ngovernment interest.”73            In the realm of capital sentencing, this\n\nstandard never can be met, because race is a “totally irrelevant\n\nfactor.”    Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 885 (1983).               Therefore,\n\nthe FDPA can pass constitutional muster only if it is interpreted\n\nabsolutely       to     prohibit    racial     considerations    in   sentencing.\n\nBecause we are obligated to interpret a statute in such a way as to\n\npreserve, if possible, its constitutionality, Rust v. Sullivan,\n\n500 U.S. 173, 190 (1991); United States v. Bird, 124 F.3d 667,\n\n678-79 (5th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1189 (1998), we\n\nreason that race cannot be considered as either a mitigating or\n\naggravating factor under the FDPA.\n\n      Although the use of race in government decision-making is, as\n\na general matter, “odious to a free people whose institutions are\n\nfounded upon the doctrine of equality,” Hirabayashi, 320 U.S. at\n\n100, the use of race in sentencing determinations is particularly\n\ninvidious.       “Discrimination on the basis of race, odious in all\n\naspects,    is        especially    pernicious     in   the   administration   of\n\njustice.\"     Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 555 (1979).                And, in\n\ncapital sentencing, the use of race becomes more offensive still:\n\n\n      73\n         Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432-33 (1984); Hirabayashi v. United\nStates, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943); Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932, 939-40 (5th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 518 U.S. 1033 (1996).\n\n                                         106\n\f      Considering the race of a defendant or victim in deciding\n      if the death penalty should be imposed is completely at\n      odds with th[e] concern that an individual be evaluated\n      as a unique human being. Decisions influenced by race\n      rest in part on a categorical assessment of the worth of\n      human beings according to color, insensitive to whatever\n      qualities the individuals in question may possess.\n\nMcCleskey, 481 U.S. at 336 (Brennan, J., dissenting).\n\n      Although divided in its decision, the Court in McCleskey was\n\nunanimous in its acknowledgment of “the illegitimacy of race as a\n\nconsideration in capital sentencing.”           Id. at 341 (Brennan, J.,\n\ndissenting); id. at 292-93 (majority opinion).          Webster would have\n\nus go against this precedent, and rule that a defendant can be\n\nspared the death penalty because of his race.           Such practices are\n\nprecisely those forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause.              Id. at\n\n341   (noting   that    “enhanced    willingness   to   impose   the   death\n\nsentence” or “diminished willingness to render such a sentence” are\n\nimpermissible when based on race).\n\n      In sum, a long line of Supreme Court precedent admonishes that\n\nthe guillotine must be as color-blind as is the Constitution. See\n\nMcCleskey, 481 U.S. at 292-93; Zant, 462 U.S. at 885; Rose,\n\n443 U.S. at 555.       Today’s decision recognizes this precedent in\n\ninterpreting the FDPA in the only way constitutionally permissible:\n\nas prohibiting the consideration of race in sentencing.\n\n      Webster   has    constructed   an    artificial   conflict,   however,\n\nbetween the FDPA and Supreme Court precedent regarding mitigating\n\nevidence.   He reads Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, and Lockett v.\n\n\n                                     107\n\fOhio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978), as mandating the use of race in\n\nsentencing.     Such a reading of Penry and Lockett is erroneous for\n\nat least two reasons:        It ignores the concept of relevancy, and it\n\nwould cause those cases to conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nfor the reasons discussed above.\n\n      Penry and Lockett hold that in capital sentencing, a defendant\n\nmust be permitted to introduce all “evidence relevant to the\n\ndefendant’s background or character . . . that mitigate against\n\nimposing the death penalty.”            Penry, 492 U.S. at 318 (emphasis\n\nadded).74    As a matter of law, race is “totally irrelevant to the\n\nsentencing process.”        Zant, 462 U.S. at 885; McCleskey, 481 U.S.\n\nat 316 (discussing the unconstitutionality of using the “irrelevant\n\nfactor of race” in sentencing).           Therefore, when the FDPA and the\n\nSupreme Court speak of “background or character” evidence, they\n\nobviously mean to permit, and can mean to permit only, the specific\n\nbeliefs and life experiences of the defendant in question.\n\n      Thus, although race per se is an irrelevant and inadmissible\n\nfactor, the effects and experiences of race may be admissible.                   If\n\na defendant can show that his life has been marked by discrimina-\n\ntion or some other set of experiences, irrespective of whether the\n\n\n      74\n         See also McCoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 440 (1990) (explaining that\nthe “meaning of relevance is no different in the context of mitigating evidence\nintroduced in a capital sentencing proceeding” from its meaning during the case in\nchief; evidence is relevant if “it tends logically to prove or disprove some fact\nor circumstance which a fact-finder could reasonably deem to have mitigating value”)\n(quoting McCoy v. North Carolina, 372 S.E.2d 12, 45 (N.C. 1988) (Exum, C.J.,\ndissenting)).\n\n                                        108\n\fresult,     in   part,   of     his    race,    then   that     properly   might    be\n\nadmissable as relevant mitigating background or character evidence.\n\nBut this is a far cry from using race in and of itself as a proxy\n\nfor such a set of beliefs and experiences.                    Pigmentation does not\n\ndefine a person’s character or background; the life that a person\n\nhas led and the things that he has experienced do.\n\n\n\n                                          P.\n\n     We permitted Webster to file a supplemental brief raising an\n\nadditional       issue   on    appeal,    arguing      that    his   conviction    and\n\nsentence were based on testimony that was illegally induced from\n\nhis co-defendants.            Citing United States v. Singleton, 144 F.3d\n\n1343 (10th Cir.), vacated for reh’g en banc, 144 F.3d 1361 (10th\n\nCir. 1998), Webster contends that the testimony of his co-defen-\n\ndants against him was induced by the government in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2).75              Because we find no plain error in the\n\nfailure sua sponte to suppress the co-defendants’ testimony, we\n\n\n     75\n          Section 201(c)(2) reads,\n\n     WhoeverSS\n\n     directly or indirectly, gives, offers or promises anything of value\n     to any person, for or because of the testimony under oath or\n     affirmation given or to be given by such person as a witness upon a\n     trial, hearing, or other proceeding, before any court, any committee\n     of either House or both Houses of Congress, or any agency,\n     commission, or officer authorized by the laws of the United States\n     to hear evidence or take testimony, or for or because of such\n     person’s absence therefrom;\n\n           shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more\n     than two years, or both.\n\n                                          109\n\fdeny Webster’s attempt to raise this issue for the first time on\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n                                        1.\n\n     In   Singleton,      a    panel   held   that   the   plain       language   of\n\n§ 201(c)(2) prohibits prosecutors from making promises “of value”\n\nto witnesses in exchange for testimony.              According to the panel,\n\nsuch prohibited promises include promises not to prosecute for\n\ncertain offenses, promises to inform authorities of cooperation,\n\nand promises to inform the court of cooperation.                 See Singleton,\n\n141 F.3d at 1348. Webster claims that the government’s promises to\n\nhis co-defendantsSSnot seeking the death penalty, agreeing to\n\nguilty pleas for lesser crimes, not prosecuting other acts stemming\n\nfrom the same incident, dismissing remaining indictment counts,\n\nnotifying   the   court       of   cooperation,   and   filing     a    motion    for\n\ndownward departure in sentencingSSviolate the plain language of\n\n§ 201(c)(2) in the same manner as did the promises in Singleton.\n\n\n\n                                        2.\n\n                                        a.\n\n     Because Webster did not move to suppress the testimony of his\n\nco-defendants, the issue of their testimony’s legality presents an\n\nentirely new issue.           We may consider this question on appeal,\n\n\n\n\n                                        110\n\ftherefore, only if it constitutes plain error.76\n\n      We find plain error “only when the appellant shows that\n\n(1) there is an error, (2) the error is plain, and (3) the error\n\naffects her substantial rights.”           Ravitch, 128 F.3d at 869 (citing\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 732).         Even if we find such an error, however,\n\nwe will not “exercise [our] discretion to correct such errors\n\nunless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.”               Id.\n\n      “Error is defined as a deviation from a legal rule in the\n\nabsence of a valid waiver.”         Calverley, 37 F.3d at 162.          “Plain is\n\nsynonymous with 'clear' or 'obvious' and 'at a minimum' contem-\n\nplates an error which was 'clear under current law' at the time of\n\nthe trial.”       Id.     Finally, “affecting substantial rights” is\n\nunderstood to mean that the error “must affect the outcome of the\n\nproceeding.”      Id. at 164.\n\n\n\n                                        b.\n\n      Webster argues that the court erred by failing sua sponte to\n\napply § 201(c)(2) and suppress the testimony of his co-defendants.\n\nMoreover, he argues that without the testimony of his co-defen-\n\n\n      76\n         See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993) (“No procedural\nprinciple is more familiar to this Court than that a [right] may be forfeited in\ncriminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right\nbefore a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.”) (quoting Yakus v. United\nStates, 321 U.S. 414, 444 (1944) (internal citations omitted)); see also United\nStates v. Ravitch, 128 F.3d 865, 869 (5th Cir. 1997); Calverley, 37 F.3d at 162;\nHelms v. United States, 340 F.2d 14, 19 (5th Cir. 1964).\n\n                                        111\n\fdants, there is great doubt that he would have been convicted.\n\n      Although    Webster's    argument     that   the   suppression   of   co-\n\ndefendant testimony substantially would have affected his convic-\n\ntion is persuasive, Webster faces an insurmountable burden in\n\nshowing that the court plainly erred.               At the time of trial,\n\nSingleton had not yet been handed down.            Thus, the court did not\n\ncommit plain error when it did not follow a decision that had not\n\nyet been decided.       Moreover, even if Singleton had been decided\n\nbefore trial, decisions of other circuits are not binding on the\n\ncourts of this circuit, so according to the “current law” of this\n\ncircuit, the testimony of co-defendants still would have been\n\nadmissible.77\n\n      The best Webster can argue is that, at the time of his trial,\n\nthe applicability of § 201(c)(2) to government plea bargains in\n\nthis circuit was uncertain.78         “The uncertainty manifest in [an]\n\narea of the law illustrates that any error on the part of the trial\n\ncourt could not have been plain.”            Calverley, 37 F.3d at 165.\n\n\n\n      77\n         We recently agreed to review a claim that was not raised until appeal\nwhen we found there had been an intervening change in the law.         See DSC\nCommunications Corp. v. Next Level Communications, 107 F.3d 322, 326 n.2\n(5th Cir. 1997).     Unlike Webster, however, the appealing party in DSC\nCommunications relied on an intervening change in the law of this circuit,\nwhereas Webster relies on a vacated opinion of another circuit.\n      78\n         The uncertainty of this circuit’s law on this point is already\nanticipated in two recent district court decisions. In United States v. Duncan,\n1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11123 (E.D. La. July 15, 1998), the court refused to order\na new trial based on § 201(c)(2). But in United States v. Fraguela, 1998 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 14347 (E.D. La. Aug. 27, 1998), the court granted a new trial and\nadopted the Singleton panel’s reading of § 201(c)(2).\n\n                                      112\n\f      Webster challenges a district court decision on the basis of\n\na new interpretation of an existing law even though no Fifth\n\nCircuit precedent directly supports his reading of § 201(c)(2).79\n\nAt most, he can support the uncertainty of § 201(c)(2)’s applica-\n\nbility to government plea bargains.          A court's failure to apply an\n\nuncertain interpretation of a statute is far from plain error.\n\nRather than finding plain error by adopting a new interpretation of\n\nan existing statute based on the vacated decision of another\n\ncircuit, we deny Webster’s challenge to the court’s failure to\n\nsuppress the testimony of his co-defendants.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n      79\n         Because we find no plain error in the failure to suppress the co-\ndefendants' testimony, we do not reach the question of the proper reading of\n§ 201(c)(2). A review of this circuit’s precedents shows, however, that we\nconsistently have upheld government efforts to provide benefits to witnesses in\nexchange for testimony when challenged on other grounds. The district court did\nnot err by conforming to this precedent.\n\n      In United States v. Cervantes-Pacheco, 826 F.2d 310, 315 (5th Cir. 1987)\n(en banc), we explained our views on the propriety of giving benefits in exchange\nfor witness testimony when we held that contingent compensation for witnesses may\noccur as long as the nature of such compensation is fully disclosed to the jury.\nWe noted that “[n]o practice is more ingrained in our criminal justice system\nthan the practice of the government calling a witness who is an accessory to the\ncrime for which the defendant is charged and having that witness testify under\na plea bargain that promises him a reduced sentence.” Id. We went on to point\nout that “courts uniformly hold that such a witness may testify so long as the\ngovernment’s bargain with him is fully ventilated so that the jury can evaluate\nhis credibility.” Id. Thus, our general rule has been to allow the government\nto confer benefits upon witnesses in exchange for testimony (even contingent\nmonetary compensation).\n\n      Along with our sister circuits, we also explicitly have upheld admitting\nthe testimony of witnesses who were promised reduced sentences.

We affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n     The   facts   are     the     same    as   in    the   case   of   Webster’s\n\nco-conspirator, Orlando Hall.         See United States v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757051\"><a href=\"/opinion/757051/united-states-v-orlando-cordia-hall-also-known-as-lan/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1998).        Webster, Hall, and Marvin Holloway ran a\n\fmarihuana trafficking enterprise in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.               They\n\npurchased marihuana in varying amounts in the Dallas/Fort Worth\n\narea with the assistance of Steven Beckley, who lived in Irving,\n\nTexas.     The marihuana was transported, typically by Beckley, to\n\nArkansas and stored in Holloway's house.\n\n     On September 21, 1994, Holloway drove Hall from Pine Bluff to\n\nthe airport in Little Rock, and Hall took a flight to Dallas to\n\nengage    in    a   drug   transaction.   Beckley   and   Hall's    brother,\n\nDemetrius Hall (D. Hall), picked up Hall at the airport.               Later\n\nthat day, Hall and Beckley met two local drug dealers, Stanfield\n\nVitalis and Neil Rene (N. Rene), at a car wash and gave them $4700\n\nfor the purchase of marihuana.       Later that day, Beckley and D. Hall\n\nreturned to the car wash to pick up the marihuana, but Vitalis and\n\nN. Rene never appeared.\n\n     When Hall got in touch with Vitalis and N. Rene by telephone,\n\nthey claimed they had been robbed of the $4700.                    Using the\n\ntelephone number that Beckley had dialed to contact Vitalis and\n\nN. Rene, Hall procured an address at the Polo Run Apartments in\n\nArlington, Texas, from a friend who worked for the telephone\n\ncompany.       Hall, D. Hall, and Beckley began conducting surveillance\n\nat the address and saw Vitalis and N. Rene exit an apartment and\n\napproach the same car they had driven to the car wash, which they\n\nclaimed was stolen from them along with the $4700.         Hall therefore\n\ndeduced that Vitalis and N. Rene had lied to him about having been\n\nrobbed.\n\n                                      2\n\f     On September 24, Hall contacted Holloway and had him drive\n\nWebster to the Little Rock airport.    From there, Webster flew to\n\nDallas. That evening, Hall, D. Hall, Beckley, and Webster returned\n\nto the Polo Run Apartments in a Cadillac owned by Cassandra Ross,\n\nHall's sister.   Hall and Webster were armed with handguns, D. Hall\n\ncarried a small souvenir baseball bat, and Beckley had duct tape\n\nand a jug of gasoline.    They approached the apartment from which\n\nthey had previously seen Vitalis and N. Rene leave.\n\n     Webster and D. Hall went to the front door and knocked.   The\n\noccupant, Lisa Rene, N. Rene’s sixteen-year-old sister, refused to\n\nlet them in and called her sister and the police emergency phone\n\nnumber.   After Webster unsuccessfully attempted to kick in the\n\ndoor, he and D. Hall looked through a sliding glass door on the\n\npatio and saw that Lisa Rene was on the telephone.         D. Hall\n\nshattered the door with the bat; Webster entered the apartment,\n\ntackled Lisa Rene, and dragged her to the car.\n\n     Hall and Beckley had returned to the car when they heard the\n\nsound of breaking glass.       Webster forced Lisa Rene onto the\n\nfloorboard of the car, and the group drove to Ross’s apartment in\n\nIrving.   Once there, they exited the Cadillac and forced Lisa Rene\n\ninto the back seat of Beckley’s car; Hall climbed into the back\n\nseat as well.    With Beckley at the wheel and Webster in the front\n\npassenger seat, they drove around looking for a secluded spot.\n\nDuring the drive, Hall raped Lisa Rene and forced her to perform\n\nfellatio on him.\n\n                                  3\n\f     Unable   to   find   a   spot   to    their   liking,   they   eventually\n\nreturned to Ross’s apartment.         From there, Beckley, D. Hall, and\n\nWebster drove Lisa Rene to Pine Bluff.         Hall remained in Irving and\n\nflew back to Arkansas the next day.                En route to Pine Bluff,\n\nWebster and D. Hall took turns raping Lisa Rene.               Once Beckley,\n\nD. Hall and Webster reached Pine Bluff, they obtained money from\n\nHolloway to get a motel room.        In the room, they tied Lisa Rene to\n\na chair and raped her repeatedly.\n\n     Hall and Holloway arrived at the motel room on the morning of\n\nSeptember 25.      They went into the bathroom with Lisa Rene for\n\napproximately fifteen to twenty minutes.             When Hall and Holloway\n\ncame out of the bathroom, Hall told Beckley, \"She know too much.\"\n\nHall, Holloway, and Webster then left the motel.\n\n     Later that afternoon, Webster and Hall went to Byrd Lake Park\n\nand dug a grave.     That same evening, Webster, Hall, and Beckley\n\ntook Lisa Rene to the park but could not find the grave site in the\n\ndark, so they returned to the motel room.           In the early morning of\n\nSeptember 26, Beckley and D. Hall moved Lisa Rene to another motel\n\nbecause they believed the security guard at the first motel was\n\ngrowing suspicious.\n\n     The same morning, Webster, Hall, and Beckley again drove Lisa\n\nRene to Byrd Lake Park.       They covered her eyes with a mask.         Hall\n\nand Webster led the way to the grave site, with Beckley guiding\n\nLisa Rene by the shoulders.          At the grave site, Hall turned Lisa\n\nRene’s back toward the grave, placed a sheet over her head, and hit\n\n                                       4\n\fher in the head with a shovel.       Lisa Rene screamed and started\n\nrunning.   Beckley grabbed her, and they both fell down.    Beckley\n\nhit her in the head twice with the shovel and handed it to Hall.\n\nWebster and Hall began taking turns hitting her with the shovel.\n\nWebster then gagged her and dragged her into the grave.          He\n\nstripped her, covered her with gasoline, and shoveled dirt back\n\ninto the grave.    When buried, Lisa Rene, although unconscious,\n\nlikely was still breathing.      Hall, Beckley, and Webster then\n\nreturned to the motel and picked up D. Hall.\n\n     Based on information from the victim’s brothers, D. Hall was\n\narrested; Hall and Beckley subsequently surrendered to the police.\n\nOn September 29, just after turning himself in, Beckley gave a\n\nconfession to a police detective and an FBI agent in which he\n\nadmitted to the kidnaping of Lisa Rene and implicated himself,\n\nHall, and an individual known as “B-Love.”   Beckley stated that he\n\nhad last seen Lisa Rene at the Pine Bluff Motel with B-Love.      A\n\nsecurity guard at the motel informed the agents and officers that\n\nWebster went by the name B-Love, and provided a description of\n\nWebster and his vehicle.     When Webster pulled into the motel\n\nparking lot during the early morning of September 30, he was\n\ndetained and subsequently arrested.\n\n\n\n                               II.\n\n     In November 1994, a six-count superseding indictment charged\n\nWebster, Hall, D. Hall, Beckley, and Holloway with various offenses\n\n                                 5\n\frelated to the kidnaping and murder of Lisa Rene.              Specifically,\n\nthe indictment charged Webster with kidnaping in which a death\n\noccurred   in   violation    of   18   U.S.C.   §   1201(a)(1)   (count    1),\n\nconspiracy to commit kidnaping in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1201(c)\n\n(count 2), traveling in interstate commerce with intent to promote\n\nextortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (count 5), and using and\n\ncarrying a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (count 6).          In February 1995, the government\n\nfiled its notice of intent to seek the death penalty against\n\nWebster pursuant to § 3593(a) of the Federal Death Penalty Act of\n\n1994 (“FDPA”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3591-3598.\n\n      Webster’s trial was severed from that of his co-defendants.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6, and\n\ncount five was dismissed on the government’s motion.               The court\n\nconducted a separate sentencing hearing before the same jury.              See\n\n§ 3593.      After the penalty phase, the jury returned special\n\nfindings that Webster satisfied the requisite elements of intent,\n\nsee § 3591(a), and that three statutory and two non-statutory\n\naggravating factors existed.1          See § 3592.      Varying numbers of\n\n      1\n        The jury unanimously found all but the first of the following statutory\naggravating factors:\n\n      II(A).      The defendant, Bruce Carneil Webster, caused the death\n      of Lisa Rene, or injury resulting in death of Lisa Rene, which\n      occurred during the commission of the offense of kidnapping.\n\n      II(B).      The defendant . . . committed the offense in an\n      especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner in that it involved\n      torture or serious physical abuse of Lisa Rene.\n                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                       6\n\fjurors found nine mitigating factors.2             See § 3592.      The court\n\n\n      1\n       (...continued)\n      II(C).      The defendant . . ., after substantial planning and\n      premeditation, committed the offense of kidnapping in which the\n      death of Lisa Rene resulted.\n\n      II(D).      The victim, Lisa Rene, was particularly vulnerable due\n      to her age.\n\nIn addition, the jury unanimously found both of the proposed non-statutory\naggravating factors:\n\n      III(A).     The defendant . . . constitutes a future danger to the\n      lives and safety of other persons.\n\n      III(B).     The effect of the instant offense on Lisa Rene’s family.\n      2\n        Webster proposed the following statutory mitigating factors (with the\nnumber of jurors finding each mitigating factor shown in brackets):\n\n      1.    The defendant’s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his\n            conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the\n            law was significantly impaired. [0]\n\n      2.    The defendant was under unusual and substantial duress. [0]\n\n      3.    Another defendant or defendants, equally culpable in the\n            crime, will not be punished by death. [4]\n\n      4.    The defendant does not have a significant prior history of\n            other criminal conduct. [0]\n\n      5.    The defendant committed the offense under severe mental or\n            emotional disturbance. [0]\n\n      Webster proposed the following non-statutory mitigating factors (with the\nnumber of jurors finding each mitigating factor shown in brackets):\n\n      1.    The defendant is or may be mentally retarded. [4]\n\n      2.    The defendant has low intellectual functioning. [4]\n\n      3.    The defendant suffered from physical abuse, from emotional\n            abuse, and/or from parental neglect during his upbringing.\n            [12]\n\n      4.    The defendant, as a result of a personality disorder, a mental\n            illness, and/or low intellectual functioning, has a lesser\n            capability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\n            conform his conduct to the requirements of the law than that\n            of a normal person. [0]\n\n      5.    The defendant was youthful at the time of the commission of\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                       7\n\fsentenced   Webster    to   death   on     count   one   of   the   superseding\n\nindictment; life imprisonment on count two; and sixty months'\n\nimprisonment on count six to run consecutively to the sentence in\n\ncount 2.\n\n\n\n                                     III.\n\n     Webster raises several grounds for reversing his conviction\n\n     2\n      (...continued)\n            the crime, although not under the age of eighteen. [0]\n\n     6.     The defendant has talents, capabilities, or qualities which\n            are of some value to society (such as musical talent,\n            religious devotion, etc.). [0]\n\n     7.     The defendant is unduly susceptible to influence by others. [0]\n\n     8.     The defendant’s level of participation in the commission of\n            this offense was attributable, at least in part, to the\n            influence of one or more of the other participants involved in\n            the commission of this crime. [4]\n\n     9.     The defendant grew up in an atmosphere of violence and fear,\n            which has misshaped his perception as to the acceptability or\n            necessity of violent conduct. [6]\n\n     10.    The defendant can be controlled in a prison setting. [2]\n\n     11.    The defendant can be of some productive value in a prison\n            setting. [0]\n\n     12.    The defendant has the love and support of other members of his\n            family. [11]\n\n     13.    The defendant does not have a significant prior history of\n            violent crime. [0]\n\n     14.    The defendant is the product of an impoverished background\n            which virtually precluded his integration into the social and\n            economic mainstream of the community. [0]\n\n     15.    The defendant has responded well to structured environments\n            and would likely adapt to prison life if he were sentenced to\n            life imprisonment. [2]\n\n     16.    Any other factor or factors in the defendant’s background,\n            record, or character or any other circumstance of the offense\n            that mitigates against imposition of the death sentence. [0]\n\n                                       8\n\fand/or sentence that we already have ruled on in Hall:\n\n      1.   The district court violated Webster’s Fifth and\n      Eighth Amendment rights by conditioning the admission of\n      psychiatric testimony in mitigation of punishment upon\n      Webster’s submission to a government psychiatric\n      examination.3\n\n      2. The district court abused its discretion by admitting\n      certain unfairly prejudicial materials into evidence,\n      namely photographs and a videotape.4\n\n      3.  The admission of evidence regarding unadjudicated\n      offenses5 during the penalty phase and a lack of a jury\n\n\n      3\n        Webster raises an additional Fifth Amendment argument relating to his\ncompelled examination, not addressed in Hall, with which we deal infra.\n      4\n         Webster attempts to parlay his evidentiary objection into a\nconstitutional claim; having upheld the evidence’s admissibility as an\nevidentiary matter, we cannot conclude that its admission nonetheless violated\nhis constitutional rights.\n\n      5\n          Webster specifically complains about the following evidence:\n\n      •       the oral statement “If I was out now, I’d kill the bitch” that\n              gave him a venereal disease.\n\n      •       the oral statement that killing Lisa Rene wasn’t personal, “it\n              was strictly business.”\n\n      •       an escape attempt where he entered an unauthorized area (the\n              women’s shower) of the Mansfield jail.\n\n      •       the sexual rendezvous with female inmates planned with fellow\n              inmate John Clay.\n\n      •       the alleged shooting at a store owner after an attempted\n              theft.\n\n      •       the assault of Sheila Henry, a girlfriend.\n\n      •       a shoving match over a piece of candy.\n\nWebster also argues these should have been excluded because of the need for\nsufficient reliability of evidence in capital proceedings.

First, it was testimony based on first-\nhand observations; Webster had the opportunity to confront and challenge each of\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                         9\n\f      instruction requiring the jury to apply some burden of\n      proof to this evidence rendered the death sentence\n      unreliable.\n\n      4.    The admission of nontestimonial victim impact\n      statements violated due process and the Eighth Amendment,\n      Webster’s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, and the\n      FDPA’s evidentiary standards.\n\nWe addressed and rejected each of these arguments in Hall, which\n                                 6\ncontrols the outcome here.\n\n\n\n                                      IV.\n\n      Webster appeals his judgment of conviction and death sentence\n\non the following grounds that we must address, as we did not\n\nconsider them in Hall:\n\n      1.   The court erroneously instructed and materially\n      misdirected the jury in numerous ways at the penalty\n      phase.\n\n      2.   The court failed to instruct the jury accurately\n      regarding on which non-monetary benefit(s) of the\n      kidnapping the government relied and regarding the need\n      for the jury to agree on such a benefit unanimously in\n      order to convict in the guilt-innocence phase.\n\n      3. The court admitted the fruits of a search pursuant\n      to, and statements given after, an arrest contravening\n\n\n      5\n       (...continued)\nthe witnesses.    Second, because Webster was given advance notice that the\ngovernment would be introducing evidence of unadjudicated offenses, he had the\nopportunity independently to investigate and respond to the evidence. Third, the\ngovernment introduced corroborating evidence for several of the incidents.\nFourth, the statements of which Webster complains were not related to\nunadjudicated offenses; rather, they were statements made to law enforcement\nofficers after his arrest. Finally, Webster provides no reason why we should be\nreticent to believe any of the testimony or that the incidents occurred.\n      6\n        See Hall, 152 F.3d at 398 (compelled psychiatric exam), id. at 400-03\n(evidentiary rulings on photographs and videotape), id. at 403-04 (unadjudicated\noffenses), id. at 404-06 (nontestimonial victim impact statements).\n\n                                      10\n\fthe Fourth Amendment.\n\n4.    The court erred by refusing to dismiss the\ngovernment’s notice to seek the death penalty based on\nallegations of racial discrimination in death penalty\ncharging decisions and by refusing Webster’s request for\ndiscovery on that claim.\n\n5. The court abused its discretion by refusing Webster’s\nmotion for post-trial discovery on a claim that the\ngovernment had provided sexual favors to a prisoner-\nwitness.\n\n6.   The court lacked authority to order Webster to\nundergo a government psychiatric exam as a condition to\nadmitting psychiatric testimony in mitigation of\npunishment.\n\n7.   The court abused its discretion in granting the\ngovernment’s Witt challenge to a venireman.\n\n8. The court’s rejection of defense challenges for cause\nto impaired and biased veniremen denied Webster an\nimpartial jury and his statutory right to free exercise\nof peremptory challenges.\n\n9. The court erred in excusing a venireman whose juror\nquestionnaire contained false information.\n\n10. The court clearly erred in denying Webster’s Batson\nclaims.\n\n11. The court erred by impaneling an alternate juror\nduring the penalty phase who did not deliberate during\nthe guilt-innocence phase.\n\n12. The court violated Webster’s constitutional rights\nand abused its discretion by limiting surrebuttal.\n\n13.   The court plainly erred and violated Webster’s\nconstitutional rights by entering a factual finding that\nhe is not mentally retarded.\n\n14.   There is insufficient evidence to support the\nsentence of death.\n\n15. Certain provisions of the FDPA are unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n                          11\n\f      16.   The court sua sponte should have suppressed the\n      testimony of Webster’s co-conspirators, who testified in\n      exchange for leniency.\n\nWe address each of these issues in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                                        A.\n\n      Webster contends that the district court erroneously in-\n\nstructed and materially misdirected the jury at the penalty phase.\n\nDistrict courts enjoy substantial latitude in formulating a jury\n\ncharge, and hence we review all challenges to, and refusals to\n\ngive, jury instructions for abuse of discretion.7\n\n      A conviction will not be reversed for an alleged error in the\n\ninstructions unless, when viewed in their entirety, they fail\n\ncorrectly to state the law.

The argument is\n\nwithout merit.\n\n\n\n                                    a.\n\n     Webster’s reasoning hinges on Enmund v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110795\"><a href=\"/opinion/110795/enmund-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1982), and Tison v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111863\"><a href=\"/opinion/111863/tison-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987).             He contends\n\nthat these cases require a two-pronged focus in the decision-making\n\nprocess to impose a death sentence: the defendant’s participation\n\n(conduct) and his intent (state of mind).             It follows, Webster\n\nbelieves,   that   the   court   should   have   instructed   the   jury    to\n\nconsider only his conduct in assessing the aggravating factors.\n\n\n\n                                    b.\n\n     Webster misreads Enmund and Tison.          In those cases, the Court\n\naddressed the degree of culpability required of a defendant to\n\nimpose a death sentence under the felony-murder doctrine.                  The\n\n\n                                    13\n\fCourt did require a certain level of culpable conduct and state of\n\nmind.     See Enmund, 458 U.S. at 801; Tison, 481 U.S. at 158.    But\n\nWebster takes the requirement too far.\n\n     The point of Tison and Enmund is that a death sentence may not\n\nbe imposed unless the sentencer has examined the defendant’s “own\n\npersonal involvement in the crimes.”         Tison, 481 U.S. at 158.\n\nEnmund escaped capital punishment because he “did not kill or\n\nattempt to kill,” nor did he have “any intention of participating\n\nin or facilitating a murder.”          Enmund, 458 U.S. at 798.   The\n\nTisons, on the other hand, failed to obtain a reversal, because\n\nthey were sufficiently involved in the crimes.     See Tison, 481 U.S.\n\nat 158.\n\n     The gist of these cases is that before a death sentence may be\n\nrecommended, the Eighth Amendment requires that the defendant, for\n\nexample, killed, inflicted serious bodily injury resulting in\n\ndeath, or participated in a felony with reckless disregard for\n\nhuman life resulting in death.   The FDPA meets this requirement in\n\n§ 3591, by limiting even the possibility of a death sentence to\n\nthose defendants with sufficient culpability.         The jury found\n\nWebster guilty of “engaging in conduct intending death to result or\n\nthat lethal force would be used” and of “engaging in conduct\n\nknowing that it created grave risk of death.”\n\n     Once the constitutionally-required minimum level of culpabil-\n\nity is found, however, there is no reason why the jury cannot take\n\n\n                                  14\n\fa broader look at the crime in assessing the aggravating factors;\n\nit need not limit itself exclusively to the defendant’s conduct or\n\nintent.     Indeed, an aggravating factor properly may focus on the\n\ndefendant,     on    the   circumstances      of   the   crime     itself,   or   on\n\ncharacteristics of the victim.8\n\n\n\n\n                                        c.\n\n       Furthermore, one of the FDPA’s aggravating factors requires a\n\njury to examine a factor that has nothing to do with the defen-\n\ndant’s     conduct    or   intentSSthe       victim’s    vulnerability.           See\n\n§ 3592(c)(11); cf. Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 977.                      The government\n\nalleged that Lisa Rene’s young age rendered her particularly\n\nvulnerable, hence constituting an aggravating factor.                 Because the\n\nfactor has nothing to do with Webster’s conduct or intent, his\n\nproffered general instruction would have incorrectly stated the\n\nlaw.\n\n       In addition, the charge as a whole substantially covered the\n\nproffered     instruction     and    sufficiently        pointed    the   jury     to\n\nWebster’s conduct and intent.

The\n\ninstructions     explaining     the    factors    repeatedly     referred     to\n\nWebster's conduct and intent.9          The non-statutory factor Webster\n\nspecifically attacks, “the effect of the offense on Lisa Rene and\n\nher family,” focuses on the harm caused by Webster’s “commission of\n\nthe offense.”     The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing\n\nthis instruction; including it would have misstated the law.\n\n\n\n                                       2.\n\n      Webster    objects   to   the   instruction     on   the   “elements    of\n\nintent.”    He argues that the court failed to require the jury to\n\nselect a single element of intent, and to do so unanimously.                This\n\nfailure allegedly allowed the jury impermissibly to “double-weigh”\n\na single factorSSintentSSin imposing the death penalty, skewing the\n\nprocess toward capital punishment.\n\n      Although Webster rightly points out the risk of unconstitu-\n\ntionally arbitrary application of the death penalty if the jury is\n\npermitted to double-count aggravating factors, see Jones, 132 F.3d\n\nat 250-51, the court did not err in this regard.             The instructions\n\n\n\n      9\n        The court's examples included the following: “'Cruel' means that the\ndefendant intended to inflict a high degree of pain . . .,” “'[d]epraved' means\nthat the defendant relished the killing or showed indifference . . .,” and “[t]he\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the\noffense after substantial planning and premeditation.”\n\n                                       16\n\fon    the   elements   of   intent    properly    followed      the    language    of\n\n§ 3591(a)(2).        They stated that the jury’s findings as to the\n\n“elements of intent” had to be unanimous.10                If any doubt remained,\n\nthe special findings form that the jury filled out prominently\n\ndisplayed the word “unanimously” before the “yes” and “no” lines to\n\nbe checked for each of the four elements.\n\n       In addition, the instructions accurately charged that the jury\n\nwas not to weigh the elements of intent in deciding whether to\n\nimpose the death penalty.           At least one of the elements of intent\n\nneeds to be found only as a threshold, or gateway, matter; and only\n\nonce at least one is found does the weighing of aggravating factors\n\nand mitigating factors take placeSSwith no further consideration of\n\nthe “elements of intent.”\n\n       The instructions walked the jury through this sequential\n\nprocess.     The court instructed the jury first to determine whether\n\none    of   the    requisite   elements   of    intent      existed.      Then    the\n\ninstructions set forth the aggravating and mitigating factors.\n\n       The instructions nowhere indicated that the jury was to\n\nconsider     the    elements   of    intent    once   it    began   to   weigh    the\n\naggravating and mitigating factors. In fact, the jury specifically\n\nwas instructed to weigh aggravating and mitigating factors with no\n\n\n\n       10\n          The court instructed that “you must as a preliminary matter unanimously\nagree that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n. . . either . . .,” followed by a list of the four possible intents, and “if you\nunanimously find . . .” one or more of the elements of intent, the jury was to\nconsider aggravating factors.\n\n                                        17\n\fmention of the elements of intent.             The special jury form also\n\nsegregated the elements of intent from the lists of aggravating and\n\nmitigating factors, and made clear the sequential nature of the\n\nprocess.\n\n     Finally,      the   court    specifically    instructed    the    jury    to\n\nconsider and weigh only the aggravating and mitigating factors\n\noutlined in the instructions, which did not include the elements of\n\nintent.    Assuming, as we must, that the jury followed its instruc-\n\ntions, it did not weigh the elements of intent even once.                     The\n\ncourt did    not    abuse   its   discretion     in   denying   the   proffered\n\ninstruction.\n\n\n\n                                       3.\n\n                                       a.\n\n     In a similar vein, Webster argues that two of the aggravating\n\nfactors overlapped, allowing the jury to weigh the same factor\n\ntwice.     Specifically, one statutory factor read: “the defendant\n\ncommitted the offense in an especially heinous, cruel and depraved\n\nmanner in that it involved torture and serious physical abuse to\n\nthe victim, Lisa Rene.”          One non-statutory factor addressed “the\n\neffect of the offense on Lisa Rene and her family, namely, that the\n\ncommission of the offense caused emotional injury and anguish to\n\nLisa Rene, and emotional injury, anguish, sorrow, and loss to her\n\nfamily.”     Webster contends that these aggravating factors are\n\nduplicative because “there is no effective distinction between\n\n                                       18\n\finfliction of 'severe mental and physical pain or suffering upon\n\nthe victim' (authorized by the court’s instructions for a finding\n\non the statutory aggravating factor) and the 'emotional injury and\n\nanguish to Lisa Rene' focused upon in the 'non-statutory' aggravat-\n\ning factor.”\n\n     Webster points out that the charge allowed the jury to find\n\nthat the statutory factor existed based on a finding of “torture,”\n\ndefined to include “mental as well as physical abuse” and the\n\nintent to “inflict severe mental or physical pain or suffering upon\n\nthe victim,” of which the victim must be conscious.        Webster\n\nalleges that there is no distinction between the statutory factor’s\n\n“severe mental or physical pain or suffering” and the non-statutory\n\nfactor’s “emotional injury and anguish.”\n\n\n\n                                b.\n\n     Webster failed to object to these instructions, so we review\n\nfor plain error.   See Jones, 132 F.3d at 243.   The court did not\n\nerr in instructing on both factors because, although they may rely\n\non similar underlying facts, they focus on different aspects of the\n\ncrime and its results.\n\n     The statutory factor directs the jury to consider whether\n\nWebster committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, and\n\ndepraved manner, hence focusing attention on his actions and\n\nintent. The non-statutory victim impact factor, on the other hand,\n\n\n\n                                19\n\fdirects the jury’s attention to the harm caused by Webster to the\n\nvictim and her family.        This factor looks not to his actions but to\n\ntheir result.        Because one factor addresses directly Webster's\n\nconduct and intent (the “manner” of commission), and the other the\n\nimpact   of   that    conduct   and    intent,   the   two   factors    are   not\n\nduplicative.\n\n       Webster’s reliance on Jones proves unavailing.             In Jones, we\n\nfound two non-statutory aggravating factors duplicative.                      One\n\naddressed     the    victim’s   “young    age,   her   slight    stature,     her\n\nbackground, and her unfamiliarity with [the locale where the crime\n\ntook   place],”      and   another    dealt   with   the   victim’s    “personal\n\ncharacteristics” and the impact of the crime.              We held the factors\n\nduplicative because “'personal characteristics' . . . necessarily\n\nincludes 'young age, slight stature, background, and unfamiliar-\n\nity.'”    Id. at 250.\n\n       But the difference between the challenged factors in the case\n\nsub judice proves to be more than semantic.                The “heinous, cruel\n\nand depraved” manner in which a crime is carried out, even though\n\nthe instructions require that the victim is conscious of the\n\nemotional abuse, does not necessarily include, nor even overlap\n\nwith, consideration of the effects of the crime on the victim and\n\nher family.         The court did not plainly err in providing both\n\ninstructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f                                      4.\n\n                                      a.\n\n      Webster argues, and the government concedes, that, by allowing\n\nthe jury to consider premeditation with respect to the kidnaping\n\nand not just the murder, the court improperly charged the jury on\n\nthe statutory aggravating factor of whether Webster engaged in\n\n“substantial planning and premeditation” of the offense.11                  The\n\nspecial    findings    form   also    contained    language    relating     the\n\npremeditation to the kidnaping rather than to causing death.                The\n\nstatute requires a finding that “the defendant committed the\n\noffense after substantial planning and premeditation to cause the\n\ndeath of a person,” § 3592(c)(9), obviously directing the premedi-\n\ntation to causing death and not to mere commission of the offense\n\nwhen the two diverge. The parties disagree, however, as to whether\n\nthis constitutes reversible error.

Although Webster’s requested jury instruction properly\n\n\n      11\n         The court charged that “[t]o establish the existence of the aggravating\nfactor of substantial planning and premeditation, the government must prove\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the offense after\nsubstantial planning and premeditation . . . . The amount of time needed for\npremeditation of a kidnapping in which a death occurs depends on the person and\nthe circumstance.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n                                      21\n\ffocused on substantial planning and premeditation for the murder,\n\nthe government points to his proposed changes to the special\n\nfindings form in which Webster proposed the following language:\n\n“Beyond a reasonable doubt and looking only to the conduct and\n\nintentions of the defendant, Bruce Carneil Webster, he, Bruce\n\nCarneil Webster, committed the killing of Lisa Rene after substan-\n\ntial planning and premeditation to commit the kidnaping of Lisa\n\nRene.”   The   government   surmises   that   the   court   adopted   this\n\nlanguage in formulating the instructions and special issue.\n\n     Although it is possible that Webster’s misstatement influenced\n\nthe instructions, Webster also proffered instructions correctly\n\napplying the substantial planning and premeditation to the killing\n\nrather than to the kidnaping.    Given the inconstant way in which\n\nWebster addressed the issue, we cannot conclude he invited the\n\nerror.\n\n\n\n                                 c.\n\n     The error notwithstanding, we affirm the sentence.         The FDPA\n\nprovides that a “court of appeals shall not reverse or vacate a\n\nsentence of death on account of any error which can be harmless,\n\nincluding any erroneous special finding of an aggravating factor,\n\nwhere the Government establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nerror was harmless.”   § 3595(c)(2)(C).\n\n     Our duty when the jury finds an invalid aggravating factor is\n\nto strike the factor and either reweigh the remaining factors\n\n                                 22\n\fagainst the mitigating evidence or apply harmless error review.\n\nSee Jones, 132 F.3d at 251; see also Clemons v.

If we choose to reweigh the evidence, we\n\nmust determine what the jury would have done absent the invalid\n\naggravator.   See Jones, 132 F.3d at 251.\n\n     In conducting a harmless error review, on the other hand, we\n\nmay inquire into whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, either (1) the\n\ndeath sentence would have been imposed had the invalid aggravating\n\nfactor been properly defined in the jury instructions or (2) the\n\ndeath sentence would have been imposed absent the invalid aggravat-\n\ning factor.   See id. at 252.   If the government establishes that\n\nthe error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we may not reverse\n\nor vacate the death sentence unless such error denies constitu-\n\ntional rights.   See § 3595.     We may decide which of the three\n\nmethods to apply, although “[i]t matters not which standard of\n\nreview an appellate court chooses to apply because all three\n\nstandards lead to the same conclusion.”     Jones, 132 F.3d at 252.\n\n     The parties expend a great deal of effort arguing whether the\n\njury would have found the factor had it been accurately stated.\n\nThe effort is wasted, however, because the sentence may be affirmed\n\nwithout that aggravating factor. We opt to apply the second method\n\nof harmless error review, and inquire into whether the sentence\n\n\n\n\n                                 23\n\fwould have been imposed absent the invalid aggravator.12\n\n      After removing the offensive statutory aggravating factor, we\n\nare left with two statutory factors (that Webster committed the\n\noffense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, and\n\nthat Lisa Rene was vulnerable), two non-statutory aggravating\n\nfactors (Webster’s future danger to others, and the effect of the\n\ncrime on Lisa Rene’s family), and nine mitigating factors found to\n\nexist by varying numbers of jurors.          The government contends, and\n\nwe agree, that the facts supporting the “especially heinous, cruel\n\nor   depraved”    factor   alone,    when   weighed    against    the   extant\n\nmitigating factors, justify a finding that the jury still would\n\nhave imposed a death sentence.          The addition of the other three\n\nfactors merely buttresses the conclusion.13\n\n      Furthermore, we fail to see why the jury would have placed\n\nmuch emphasis on the invalid factor as it was improperly defined\n\nand charged.     The import of substantial planning and premeditation\n\nto commit the offense of kidnaping pales in comparison to the\n\nbrutal nature of Webster’s actions and the suffering Lisa Rene must\n\nhave felt as a result, so we do not think the jury would have\n\nplaced significant weight on the invalid factor relative to the\n\n\n      12\n         We also find that the government has established beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the jury would have found the aggravating factor if the instructions\nproperly had charged the jury on it; thus we can affirm under the first harmless\nerror review, as well.\n      13\n        Webster asserts that we should give the aggravating factor dealing with\nvictim vulnerability little weight because the Hall jury did not find it. But\nWebster’s jury did, and we refuse to question that determination.\n\n                                      24\n\fothers.\n\n     Finally, the paltry mitigating factors that the jury found\n\nfail to indicate that it placed much weight on countervailing\n\nfactors. No juror found that Webster had talents, capabilities, or\n\nqualities of some value to society or that he could be of some\n\nproductive value in a prison setting.           Only two jurors believed\n\nthat he even could be controlled in a prison setting, and only two\n\nfound he likely would adapt to prison.           The jury found only one\n\nfactor unanimously:       Webster suffered from physical or emotional\n\nabuse or parental neglect during his upbringing; and yet no juror\n\nbelieved that this abuse caused significant impairment of Webster’s\n\nability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform\n\nhis conduct to the requirements of the law.            The government has\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have imposed\n\nthe death sentence absent the invalid aggravating factor, so its\n\ninclusion was harmless error.14\n\n\n\n                                      5.\n\n     Webster contends that the court erred when it refused to\n\nsubmit several nonstatutory mitigating factors.15           Just this past\n\n\n     14\n         We see no reason why the inclusion of the invalid factor rises to the\nlevel of a denial of constitutional rights that would require vacating the\nsentence.\n     15\n          The rejected factors are:\n\n     8.

Indeed, in Buchanan, refusing to submit four\n\nstatutory mitigating factors             during the penalty phase of the\n\ncapital trial fell short of constitutional error.\n\n       Many of the mitigating factors presented to the jury touched\n\non the ones Webster complains were omitted.

The charge\n\nspecifically instructed the jury that it “must consider” any other\n\nmitigating factors it found, “whether or not specifically argued by\n\ndefense counsel.”\n\n      The instructions left no room for the jury to ignore constitu-\n\ntionally relevant evidence.          The court neither committed constitu-\n\ntional error nor abused its discretion in rejecting the mitigating\n\nfactors.\n\n\n\n                                        6.\n\n      Webster avers that the instructions misstated the law by not\n\nrequiring, once one or more jurors had found a mitigating factor to\n\nexist by a preponderance of the evidence, that all jurors             consider\n\na   mitigating      factor   in     weighing   aggravating   and   mitigating\n\nfactors.16 Webster misreads the statute; although any one juror may\n\nfind and weigh a mitigating factor, the others may make their own\n\ndeterminations with respect to each mitigator.\n\n\n      16\n           The court charged that\n\n      [a] finding with respect to a mitigating factor may be made by any\n      one or more of the members of the jury, and any member who finds the\n      existence of a mitigating factor may consider such factor\n      established regardless of whether any other jurors agree that such\n      mitigating factor has been established. . . .        In determining\n      whether a sentence of death is appropriate, each of you must weigh\n      in your own mind, any aggravating factor or factors that the jury\n      unanimously finds to exist beyond a reasonable doubt—whether\n      statutory or non-statutory—against any mitigating factor or factors\n      that you individually find to exist by a preponderance of the\n      evidence.\n\n                                        27\n\f       Webster relies on § 3593(e), which reads, in part, “the jury\n\n. . . shall consider whether all the aggravating factor or factors\n\nfound to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor or\n\nfactors found to exist to justify a sentence of death.”              Webster\n\nreads this provision to say that once any juror finds a mitigating\n\nfactor, all jurors must weigh the factor.         But the quoted language\n\ndoes   not   require   Webster’s   reading;     the    provision   lacks   any\n\nmodifier indicating who must find or weigh the mitigating fac-\n\ntor(s).\n\n       Reading the section as a whole, we conclude that Congress did\n\nnot intend Webster’s reading.         The prior subpart states that “[a]\n\nfinding with respect to a mitigating factor may be made by 1 or\n\nmore members of the jury, and any member of the jury who finds the\n\nexistence of a mitigating factor may consider such factor estab-\n\nlished for the purposes of this section regardless of the number of\n\njurors    who   concur   that   the    factor    has    been   established.”\n\n§ 3593(d).      Reading the two sections in pari materia, we reason\n\nthat the language does not contemplate forcing all jurors to\n\nconsider a mitigator when any one or more finds it to exist.\n\nRather, each juror may consider a factor regardless of whether\n\nothers concur.     In addition, it would be nonsensical for Congress\n\nto require a juror to weigh a factor that he or she does not\n\nbelieve the evidence warrants.\n\n       Webster, in an apparent attempt to avoid this last problem,\n\n\n                                      28\n\fargues that “[o]nce a mitigating factor has been established, then\n\nthe sentencer must consider it, even though it may be assigned\n\nwhatever weight it is deemed to deserve.”    But, naturally, those\n\njurors who did not find the mitigating factor to exist would assign\n\nit no weight, which does not differ from the result Webster hopes\n\nto avoid, i.e., not requiring them to consider it at all.   Because\n\nthe plain language of the statute does not compel every juror to\n\nweigh each mitigating factor found by at least one juror, the\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the instruction that\n\nwould have required it.\n\n\n\n                                B.\n\n                                1.\n\n     The indictment alleged, inter alia, that Webster and others\n\nviolated 18 U.S.C. § 1201(a), proscribing kidnaping.   Pursuant to\n\nthat indictment, the court charged the jury that to convict, it had\n\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt the element “[t]hat the defendant\n\nheld such person for ransom, reward, or some other benefit that the\n\ndefendant intended to derive from the kidnapping.”       The court\n\nfurther charged that “a benefit is any legal or illegal object of\n\nthe kidnaping which a perpetrator might consider sufficient motive\n\nto induce him to undertake the kidnaping.   The government has the\n\nburden of proving whatever benefit alleged by proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.”\n\n\n                                29\n\f     Webster objects to this instruction on the ground that,\n\nbecause the indictment failed to allege any specific benefit other\n\nthan ransom or reward, the jury should not be able to consider any\n\nother   benefit,   and    because   the    instruction    fails   to   require\n\nunanimity on the benefit found.           The government responds that the\n\nbenefit is not a specific element of the crime, so it need not\n\nallege one in the indictment, nor does one need to be specified in\n\nthe jury instructions; furthermore, unanimity is not required.\n\n\n\n                                     2.\n\n     We review alleged errors in jury instructions for abuse of\n\ndiscretion; a conviction will not be reversed for an alleged error\n\nin the instructions unless, when viewed in their entirety, they\n\nfailed to state the law correctly.          Jones, 132 F.3d at 243.

Before 1934, the\n\nFederal Kidnaping Act applied only if the captive was held for\n\nransom or reward.        See United States v.

In Osborne, we held that the\n\ngovernment must prove four elements of the kidnaping offense:\n\n“1) the transportation in interstate commerce; 2) of an uncon-\n\nsenting person who is 3) held for ransom, reward, or otherwise; and\n\n4) the acts were done knowingly and willingly.”                    Id. at 100.\n\nAccording to Webster, the third element requires the government to\n\nplead in the indictment and prove up at trial, and the court to\n\ninstruct the jury on, some specific purpose(s) for the kidnaping.\n\n      Osborne does not compel this conclusion. We certainly did not\n\npurport to overrule Clinton’s holding that the indictment need not\n\ninclude a benefit; the issue was not before us in Osborne.

Webster made such a request, which the court denied; he\n\ncomplains that this prevented him from presenting an effective\n\ndefense.     We fail to see how.\n\n      Although    the    government     must   plead       and   prove    that   the\n\ndefendant held the victim for some purpose, the exact nature of\n\nthat purpose is inconsequential.             Indeed, as noted, any purpose\n\nwill do.      In arguments to the jury, the government mentioned\n\nseveral possible        benefits,    including      retribution     and   revenge,\n\nsexual gratification, greed, and that Lisa Rene knew too much; all\n\nare valid benefits. In light of this breadth, Webster’s claim that\n\nthe   failure    to   specify   a   benefit    in    the    indictment     or    jury\n\ninstructions denied him a defense is vapid.\n\n      If any benefit will do, the only possible defense is that the\n\ndefendant obtained absolutely no benefit at allSSand no pleading or\n\njury instruction is needed to prepare the defendant for this\n\ndefense.     Accordingly, we decline to require specificity in the\n\nfactual basis of the benefit.19\n\n\n\n\n      19\n        Cf. United States v.

On the other hand, if unanimity is\n\nnot required, an instruction on specific benefits proves pointless,\n\nbecause   each   juror   can   pick    a    benefit   from   among   the   facts\n\npresented at trial.\n\n     The question, then, should be framed as follows:                  If some\n\njurors believed that Webster held Lisa Rene for one purpose, e.g.,\n\nsexual gratification, and others believe for another benefit, e.g.,\n\nrevenge for a drug deal gone bad, does that disagreement, that lack\n\nof unanimity, evidence a reasonable doubt that Webster held Lisa\n\nRene for some benefit?     The inquiry is governed by United States v.\n\nCorrea-Ventura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654601\"><a href=\"/opinion/654601/united-states-v-armando-correa-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n     In Correa-Ventura, we analyzed whether a jury needed to reach\n\nunanimous consensus on which of several weapons seized from the\n\ndefendant’s apartment had been used in the commission of a drug\n\ntrafficking offense.     In the process of holding factual unanimity\n\nwas not required, we explicated the case-by-case analysis we must\n\nfollow here.     See id. at 1081.\n\n     As we explained, the unanimity rule ensures that the jury has\n\n\n                                       34\n\ffound   guilt    beyond   reasonable    doubt,   and   disagreement    as   to\n\ncritical facts may reflect such doubt.           Id. at 1078.    But not all\n\nfacts require unanimity.       To determine which ones do, we examine\n\n“[s]tatutory     language    and   construction,       legislative    intent,\n\nhistorical treatment of the crime by the courts, duplicity concerns\n\nwith respect to defining the offense, and the likelihood of jury\n\nconfusion in light of the specific facts presented.”            Id. at 1082.\n\nAfter considering these factors, we conclude that the jury need not\n\nconcur on the benefit the defendant derived from holding the\n\nkidnaping victim.\n\n     Looking at the language of the element, we see that the actus\n\nreus proscribed is the “holding” of a victim.            The benefit, “for\n\nransom, reward, or otherwise,” merely adds purpose to the act of\n\nholding.    Looking to the offense as a whole, we see that the\n\nessential elements, stripped to the bones, are transporting and\n\nholding against consent with a mens rea. The “interstate commerce”\n\nserves as a mere jurisdictional hook, and the benefit language\n\nsimply provides guidance to a jury in understanding the crimeSSwhy\n\nthe defendant may have committed the offense.                 The essence of\n\nkidnaping   is   a   non-consensual     transporting    and   holding,   done\n\nwilfully or knowingly; the language in no way implies that the\n\nbenefit serves an important function in singling out the guilty\n\nfrom the innocent or in deterring future conduct.\n\n     The history of the offense also points to the insubstantial\n\n\n                                       35\n\frole of the benefit.         The Supreme Court has admonished that\n\nCongress added the “or otherwise” language because “ransom or\n\nreward” proved too narrow; Congress desired to expand the statute\n\nby eliminating the limiting effect that the phrase had.            See Gooch,\n\n297 U.S. at 128; Healy, 376 U.S. at 81-82.          We should not circum-\n\nscribe    the   statute’s   reach,   once   again   giving   the    phrase   a\n\nnarrowing function, by requiring factual concurrence among the\n\njurors.\n\n     Interpretive caselaw and the issue of duplicative convictions\n\nalso support rejecting a unanimity requirement. As cited above, we\n\nand our sister circuits always have emphasized the breadth of the\n\nbenefit phrase.      We are aware of no case in which a court has\n\nlimited the kidnaping offense through the benefit requirement.\n\n     In addition, concerns regarding duplicative convictions have\n\nnot arisen.     Webster does not argue that a lack of concurrence on\n\nthe factual predicate of a benefit risks duplicative convictions\n\nfor a single act of holding and transporting.          We know of no case\n\nin which a defendant was convicted of or even charged with multiple\n\nkidnaping offenses of the same victim because it was done for more\n\nthan one benefit.\n\n     Finally, the circumstances of the instant case do not justify\n\nvacating the sentence and requiring unanimity on the benefit.\n\nSeveral benefits were argued to the jury.           There was sufficient\n\nevidence from which a juror could find that Webster was motivated\n\n\n                                     36\n\fby the lure of those benefits.              Indeed, if unanimity had been\n\nrequired, it is likely that the jury unanimously would have found\n\nseveral benefits garnered by Webster, including revenge and sexual\n\ngratification. The court provided a general unanimity instruction,\n\nfocusing the jury’s attention on the need to agree on the essential\n\nelements of the crime.          Unanimity on the factual basis of the\n\nbenefit is not required, and the court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin refusing Webster’s instruction.20\n\n\n\n                                       C.\n\n      Webster contends that his arrest was unconstitutional and that\n\nthe fruits obtained from it should have been suppressed.                    More\n\nspecifically, he argues that the court erred by failing to suppress\n\nthe fruits of the search of Webster and his automobile following\n\nhis arrest, that any purported consent given by him was nullified\n\nby the illegality of the arrest, and that the court erred by\n\nfailing to suppress his statements following his arrest.                       It\n\nreadily becomes apparent that Webster’s arguments hinge on his view\n\nthat the arrest was unconstitutional.            Because we find both this\n\narrest and subsequent police conduct fully constitutional, the\n\ncourt properly admitted the fruits of the search and the subsequent\n\n\n      20\n         Cf.

Based on this\n\nstandard, the police had probable cause to arrest Webster.\n\n       The day before the arrest, police took a written statement\n\nfrom    Beckley,   Webster’s     partner-in-crime.

That is,\n\nthe issue of identification comes into play, as the police must\n\nhave had probable cause to believe that the man whom they arrested\n\nwas indeed Webster. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we\n\nfind that such probable cause existed.\n\n     Beckley identified Webster as “B-Love” and described him as “a\n\nblack dude about 20 years old, about 5'9\", 150-160 pounds, black\n\nlow cut hair, brown skinned.”   Beckley explained how he and B-Love\n\nwere involved in the sale of marihuana and how the kidnaping of\n\nLisa Rene arose from Beckley and Webster’s drug transactions.\n\n     Beckley told the police that he and B-Love took Lisa Rene to\n\na cheap motel, tying her to a chair in a room that ended in the\n\ndigits “13.”   Beckley led Detective Ford and FBI Special Agent\n\nFloyd to this motel, called the Pine Bluff Motel.    He took them to\n\nroom 513, which he identified as the room in which he and B-Love\n\nhad taken Rene.   Floyd interviewed the hotel manager, obtaining a\n\nreceipt for room 513 in the name of Bruce Webster.\n\n     FBI Special Agent Mason and Agent McCall were assigned to\n\nassist Ford and Floyd by going to the motel to help gather\n\n\n\n                                 39\n\fevidence.   They were told to be on the lookout for “B-Love,” who\n\nhad kidnaped Lisa Rene and kept her in room 513.   Mason and McCall\n\nquestioned a security guard about the guests of room 513 and were\n\ntold that a local man named Bruce Webster had stayed in that room,\n\nalong with three other black men, on the dates in question.     The\n\nguard added that Webster went by the nickname of “B-Love” and\n\ndescribed him as “a black male, approximately 5'8\" tall and 150\n\npounds,” seen wearing a black leather cap and driving an older\n\nAmerican, dark blue, square-looking sedan. The guard also told the\n\nagents that Webster was a drug dealer.\n\n     Later that day, the agents observed a black man driving an\n\nolder American, dark blue, square-looking car and wearing a black\n\nleather cap; a woman was in the passenger seat.          The agents\n\nsignaled the suspect to stop; in response, the suspect sped up,\n\napparently attempting to flee. The agents pursued, and when one of\n\nthem shouted “B-Love, this is the F.B.I.    Stop where you are and\n\nput your hands up,” the driver stopped.   The driver was, of course,\n\nWebster, also known as B-Love.    At that point, the police placed\n\nWebster on the ground and handcuffed him.\n\n     The agents had probable cause to arrest Webster for kidnaping.\n\nAlthough they did not have personal knowledge of his specific\n\nwrongdoings, they are permitted to act on the probable cause\n\ndetermination of others in their department.

Factors to\n\nconsider in making this determination are the coerciveness of\n\npolice procedures, the extent of the defendant’s cooperation, his\n\nawareness   of   his    right   to   refuse      consent,    his    education      and\n\nintelligence, and his belief as to whether incriminating evidence\n\nwill be found.     Cooper, 43 F.3d at 144.\n\n     Webster’s experience in police procedure, resulting from his\n\nlengthy criminal record, belies the assertion that he was unaware\n\nof his rights or uneducated as to the situation he faced.                       And the\n\nfact that the police asked him not once but twice for permission to\n\nsearch his automobile (the second time being when they came to the\n\ntrunk of the car) undercuts the argument that the police were\n\ncoercive in their request.           Under these facts, Webster’s consent\n\nwas freely given.\n\n\n\n\n                                       44\n\f                                     D.\n\n     Webster argues that the court erred by denying his motion to\n\ndismiss the government’s notice to seek the death penalty based on\n\nracial discrimination in the charging decision and by denying his\n\ndiscovery request on this issue. To support the motion to dismiss,\n\nWebster offered an affidavit showing that 66% of federal death\n\npenalty cases involved black defendants. The court denied both the\n\nmotion to dismiss and the motion for discovery and an evidentiary\n\nhearing, noting that Webster had failed to make out the requisite\n\nprima facie case that he had been singled out for prosecution but\n\nothers similarly situated were not prosecuted.\n\n\n\n                                     1.\n\n     We review constitutional claims de novo.

See\n\nSparks, 2 F.3d at 580; Hoover, 727 F.2d at 389.\n\n     In making these requisite showings, the defendant must rebut\n\nthe presumption that the government made its decision to prosecute\n\nin good faith and in a nondiscriminatory manner.         Hoover, 727 F.2d\n\nat 389.   To dispel the presumption of prosecutorial good faith, “a\n\n                                      46\n\fcriminal defendant must present 'clear evidence to the contrary.'”\n\nId. at      465    (quoting    United   States   v.

Webster\n\ncites McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 293 n.12, which may allow finding a\n\nconstitutional violation (or prima facie finding thereof) in very\n\nlimited    circumstances     if   the   data   presents    a   “stark”   enough\n\npicture. But the 66% figure Webster provides is no more stark than\n\nwere the statistics in the Baldus Study at issue in McCleskey.25\n\n      Webster also argues that counsel would have shown that they\n\nhad requested that the Department of Justice consider this racial\n\ndisproportionality as a factor mitigating against authorization of\n\nthe death penalty in this case, and the government refused because\n\nof “the purported 'race neutrality' required by DOJ policies in\n\ncapital charging decisions.”            Likewise, Webster contends that\n\n“failure of the Government to 'affirmatively act' to overcome such\n\nracially discriminatory application” of the death penalty “amounted\n\nto purposeful discrimination.”          This, however, fails to establish\n\nthe discriminatory purpose required under the second prong of the\n\nselective prosecution test.\n\n      Discriminatory purpose “implies that the decisionmaker . . .\n\nselected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in\n\npart 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects\n\nupon an identifiable group.”        Id. at 291 (quotation omitted).          The\n\n\n      25\n        Baldus reported that Georgia prosecutors sought the death penalty in 70%\nof the cases involving black defendants and white victims, 32% of the cases\ninvolving white defendants and white victims, 15% of the cases involving black\ndefendants and black victims, and 19% of the cases involving white defendants and\nblack victims. See McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 287.\n\n                                        48\n\fabove evidence, at best, shows action in spite of a putatively\n\nadverse discriminatory effect and not purposeful discrimination.\n\n      Furthermore, a non-discriminatory explanation for seeking the\n\ndeath penalty against Webster is evident on the facts:                   It is\n\njustified by the objective circumstances of the crime and the\n\nsufficiency and availability of evidence to prove the required\n\nelements under the law.        These are the precise considerations the\n\nSupreme Court identified as proper and legitimate grounds for such\n\na decision.     See id. at 307 n.28.            The verdict attests to the\n\nobjective considerations, and Webster has made no effort to rebut\n\nthem.\n\n\n\n                                       3.\n\n      Webster’s attempt to obtain discovery on the issue stands on\n\nequally faulty ground. In Armstrong, the Court addressed the issue\n\nof   the   showing    necessary   to   obtain    discovery   on   a   claim    of\n\nselective prosecution based on racial discrimination.                 The Court\n\nfirst quickly disposed of any claim for discovery under FED. R.\n\nCRIM. P. 16, stating, “We hold that Rule 16(a)(1)(C) authorizes the\n\ndefendants    to     examine   Government   documents    material       to    the\n\npreparation of their defense against the Government’s case-in-\n\nchief, but not to the preparation of selective-prosecution claims.”\n\nArmstrong, 517 U.S. at 463.\n\n      Webster contends that a defendant “necessarily has a lesser\n\n\n                                       49\n\fburden when seeking discovery to aid in proving the elements of a\n\nprima facie case of selective prosecution.”         The Court, however,\n\nheld squarely against Webster’s assertion, stating, “The justifica-\n\ntion for a rigorous standard for the elements of a selective\n\nprosecution claim thus require a correspondingly rigorous standard\n\nfor discovery in aid of such a claim.”       Id. at 468.\n\n     Finally, Webster argues that he requested the discovery also\n\nto establish mitigating evidence that a death sentence would\n\npropagate a racially discriminatory application of the federal\n\ndeath penalty.      Webster makes no argument other than that a\n\ndefendant is entitled to present any mitigating evidence, which he\n\nwas denied by denial of the discovery request.\n\n     The government aptly responds that the Armstrong discovery\n\nrule for selective prosecution applies, requiring a prima facie\n\nshowing.   Any other rule would allow circumvention of Armstrong’s\n\nrequirements.\n\n     Furthermore,   the   Court   in    Armstrong   justified   its   high\n\nstandard for discovery in selective prosecution claims, explaining:\n\n     Judicial deference to the decisions of [prosecutors]\n     rests in part on an assessment of the relative competence\n     of prosecutors and the courts.      Such factors as the\n     strength of the case, the prosecution’s general deter-\n     rence value, the Government’s enforcement priorities, and\n     the case’s relationship to the Government’s overall\n     enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind\n     of analysis courts are competent to undertake. It also\n     stems from a concern not to unnecessarily impair the\n     performance of a core executive constitutional function.\n     Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal\n     proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by\n\n                                   50\n\f     subjecting the prosecutor’s motives and decisionmaking to\n     outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effec-\n     tiveness by revealing the Governments enforcement policy.\n\n517 U.S. at 465 (citations and quotations omitted). The competency\n\nconcerns apply a fortiori when lay jurors are asked to analyze\n\nprosecutorial decisions.\n\n     In addition, Webster had the statistical evidence regarding\n\nthe allegedly discriminatory manner in which the modern federal\n\ndeath penalty has been applied and yet chose not to attempt to\n\nintroduce it during the sentencing hearings; this may indicate his\n\nlack of confidence in this evidence’s mitigating value.\n\n\n\n                                E.\n\n     Webster contends that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion for post-trial discovery on the issue of whether one of the\n\ncase’s lead law enforcement investigators, Special Agent Floyd, had\n\n“purchased” the testimony of a prosecution witness, John Clay, by\n\nallowing a conjugal visit at a private residence in violation of\n\nagency guidelines.   Webster argues that if discovery had verified\n\nthis claim, it would have impeached the testimony of Clay and\n\nFloyd, thus constituting grounds for a new trial.\n\n\n\n                                1.\n\n     We review discovery rulings for abuse of discretion.

Clay, who had charges\n\npending against him for drug dealing that included the possibility\n\nof a life sentence, was taken to the holdover cell on the second\n\nfloor   of    the   federal   courthouse.   When    he   arrived   from   the\n\nMansfield Correctional Enforcement Center, Webster was present in\n\nthe holdover cell.        Webster then left and came back and began\n\njumping around, saying that “there has got to be a God” because his\n\ntrial had been set to a later day.          Clay testified that Webster\n\n\n                                     52\n\falso preached a thirty-minute sermon, “quot[ing] scriptures out of\n\nthe Bible that has to be photographic in his mind because it was so\n\naccurate.” Clay and Webster conversed in “pig latin” after Webster\n\nstarted using it.       Clay demonstrated pig latin for the jury.\n\n     Webster then told Clay about a “master mind plan” to arrange\n\nfor each of them to have sexual contact with a female inmate by\n\nmanipulating the visiting process.           Before the two men were taken\n\nback to Mansfield, Webster told Clay that he would write a letter\n\nto him in pig latin to explain the plan.          Webster in fact sent such\n\na letter to ClaySSthe letter was introduced into evidence, with the\n\ndefense stipulation        that   Webster   had   authored     it.   With    the\n\nprosecutor reading the letter, Clay interpreted some of the slang\n\nused.\n\n     Clay also testified that he was cooperating with the govern-\n\nment in hopes of a sentence reduction.

Webster asked the court to order the\n\ngovernment to disclose any information that reasonably could be\n\nobtained      regarding     inducements     given   by   Floyd   to    Clay   and,\n\nspecifically, that the government be ordered to disclose the\n\nresults of any investigation relating to the matter.                  The govern-\n\nment already had volunteered to provide the requested information\n\nto Webster, subject to confidentiality limitations.\n\n      In its response to the motion for new trial, the government\n\nreaffirmed its continuing obligation and intention to disclose any\n\nmitigating or impeaching evidence.            The government further noted\n\nthat it would work with Webster’s counsel to help them secure\n\naffidavits that had been filed in other cases in connection with\n\nthe allegations. Webster then filed a motion in which he requested\n\nthe court to\n\n      order the attorneys for the government to produce and\n\n\n      26\n           (...continued)\nWebster’s confession. As discussed above, the district court properly denied the\nmotion to suppress the confession; the questions Webster raises regarding Floyd’s\ncredibility do not alter that determination.\n\n                                       54\n\f     hand over to the defense counsel all information associ-\n     ated with the activities of Special Agent Garrett Floyd\n     of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that are related\n     to the granting of inducements, favors, privileges,\n     rewards, concessions or anything of value to any witness\n     directly or indirectly associated with this instant case.\n     This order should extend as well to any other case which\n     is, or may be, a part of a systematic action on the part\n     of Agent Floyd or other government actors to grant favors\n     to witnesses in return for their testimony.\n\nCounsel for Webster acknowledged that he had received copies of the\n\naffidavits used in other cases involving the same allegation and\n\nthat defense investigators were looking into other possible sources\n\nof information.\n\n     In response to the motion for post-trial discovery, the\n\ngovernment noted that the district court having jurisdiction over\n\nthe cases in which this allegation had been made had determined\n\nthat Floyd was unaware that Clay had had sexual contact while in\n\nFloyd’s custody and that a new trial was not warranted.                  The\n\ngovernment asked the court to deny Webster’s post-trial motion\n\nbecause   the   motion   was   too   broad,   and   again   reiterated   its\n\ncontinuing discovery obligation.\n\n     The court denied Webster’s motion, stating that even\n     assuming that all of the facts asserted in [Webster’s]\n     motion and the addendum are trueSSthat the Federal Bureau\n     of Investigation Special Agent assigned with primary\n     responsibility for investigating this case took federal\n     prisoner John Clay from his detention facility, trans-\n     ported him to the home of a female friend, and knowingly\n     allowed Clay and the female to engage in sexual activi-\n     ties, all in exchange for Clay’s testimony in this cause,\n     and the prosecutor knowingly withheld this information\n     from Defendant,\n\nthe evidence was not material.         Citing United States v. Bagley,\n\n\n                                     55\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682 (1985), the court found that even if this\n\ninformation had been disclosed before trial, the result would have\n\nbeen the same.\n\n\n\n                                 3.\n\n     The court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion\n\nfor post-trial discovery.   Even assuming the allegations are true,\n\nthey fail to undermine confidence in the verdict.    Clay was only\n\none of many government witnesses who testified to rebut Webster’s\n\nclaim of mental retardation, including school teachers, counselors,\n\nprincipals, employers, and detention center personnel.     Much of\n\nClay’s testimony focused on the letter written by Webster’s own\n\nhand that set forth the “plan” for a sexual rendezvous with female\n\ninmates.   It is evident from the record that Webster concocted the\n\nelaborate scheme to manipulate the detention center’s visitation\n\nsystem and sought Clay’s assistance.   Clay’s other testimony could\n\nbe redacted, and there would still be ample evidence to support the\n\njury’s findings regarding Webster’s mental abilities.\n\n     Furthermore, Clay admitted that he had testified in hopes of\n\na reduced sentence, and the defense impeached his testimony with\n\nthe allegation that Clay held a grudge against Webster.    Further\n\nimpeachment via the possible quid pro quo of sex for testimony\n\nlikely would not have affected more than marginally the weight the\n\njury gave to Clay’s testimony.\n\n\n\n                                 56\n\f       With respect to Floyd’s testimony, he too was only one of many\n\nwitnesses who testified regarding Webster’s future dangerousness.\n\nOther   witnesses   included   Special      Agent   William   Eppright,    who\n\ntestified that, on an occasion separate from the one testified to\n\nby Floyd, Webster said killing Lisa Rene was “strictly business.”\n\nMohamed Ghene testified regarding Webster’s attempted robbery of\n\nhis clothing store and the shots Webster fired at him from across\n\nthe street.     Tlisha Booth presented testimony pertaining to a\n\nshoving match over a piece of candy.        Sylvia Henry, corroborated by\n\na security guard and Booth, testified that Webster had assaulted\n\nher at a nightclub.      Pine Bluff Police Department Officer Lance\n\nLawhorn testified that, while he was transporting Webster, Webster\n\nstated that if he was not in custody he would “kill the bitch” who\n\ngave him a venereal disease.        Even if Floyd’s testimony regarding\n\nWebster’s oral statements were redacted, the record provides ample\n\nevidence of future dangerousness.\n\n       Moreover, any damage to Floyd’s credibility caused by these\n\nallegations would be mitigated by the finding of the district court\n\nwith    jurisdiction   over   the   cases   where   the   allegations     were\n\ninitially made that Floyd was unaware that Clay had any sexual\n\ncontact while in his custody and that a new trial was not war-\n\nranted.    There is no reasonable probability that the verdict would\n\nhave been different had the jury known of the alleged Floyd-Clay\n\nincident, so the court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\ndiscovery.\n\n                                     57\n\f                                      F.\n\n      Webster argues the district court lacked a statutory or\n\nconstitutional (Fifth Amendment) basis to compel him to submit to\n\na mental health exam by a government expert as a prerequisite to\n\nintroducing his own expert psychiatric testimony.                We find no\n\nerror.\n\n\n\n                                      1.\n\n      Although compelling Webster to a government psychiatric exam,\n\nthe   court also granted, in part, Webster’s motion to limit the\n\nscope of the exam.      Specifically, the court barred examination of\n\nWebster’s future dangerousness.            The government’s witness, Dr.\n\nGeorge Parker, however, testified that he found that Webster’s\n\nincarceration would lead to “a potentially very dangerous situa-\n\ntion.”     Webster argues this aspect of the testimony constitutes a\n\nFifth Amendment violation.\n\n      Webster’s argument falls well short of reversible error.\n\nFirst, he mischaracterizes the record.          There is no evidence that\n\nany government expert was asked to27 or did conduct an examination\n\nof Webster with regard to his future dangerousness.           The reports of\n\nDr. Coons and Dr. Parker state that they had sufficient data to\n\nassess Webster’s future dangerousness without examination designed\n\n\n      27\n         When first contacted and hired, before the court’s limiting order,\nDr. Coons was informed that part of the exam would be for future dangerousness.\nBut nothing in the record indicates that either Coons or Dr. Parker actually\nconducted an exam for future dangerousness.\n\n                                      58\n\fto uncover that.      Our reading of the record leads us to conclude\n\nthat, contrary to Webster’s assertion, Coon’s testimony regarding\n\nWebster’s future dangerousness did not turn on an examination in\n\nviolation of the court ordered limits.\n\n      Second, Webster never objected on these grounds, so he failed\n\nto preserve the issue for appeal.          Finally, even if such testimony\n\nwere given and properly objected to, the error of allowing the\n\ntestimony proves harmless, because there is ample independent\n\nevidence to support a finding of future dangerousness.28\n\n\n\n                                      2.\n\n      The Hall panel avoided the question of statutory authority\n\nbecause it had not been properly briefed.              See Hall, 152 F.3d\n\nat 398.    We now face the issue and conclude that the district court\n\nhad the authority to order the exam.\n\n\n\n                                      a.\n\n      A district court’s decisions in overseeing criminal discovery\n\nare entitled to great deference.             Alleged error is subject to\n\nreview for abuse of discretion, and we will reverse only if a\n\ndefendant establishes prejudice to substantial rights.

Based on this, Webster believes her\n\nability to perform her duties as a juror was not impaired.\n\n      Other excerpts, however, support the government’s concern and\n\nthe court’s decision.         Vicar stated, “I mean from one day to the\n\nnext, I don’t have the same opinion of what I could do.                  I think\n\nthere could be, depending on what the situations were, that I could\n\nsay, yes, that’s what it should be, that’s what the penalty should\n\nbe.   I don’t consistently, from day to day, think I could actually\n\ndo that if there really is a life sentence.”\n\n      Indeed, in answering several questions, Vicar wavered on\n\nwhether she could sentence a defendant to death if a life sentence\n\nwithout parole option were a viable alternative.34             The government,\n\n\n      34\n           During questioning by the government, Vicar gave the following answers:\n\n      A.      I guess it’s not something that I have ever wanted to do.\n              I guess I have debated since we filled out that questionnaire\n              whether I could really do it or not, but that doesn’t say\n              I don’t think it’s necessary.

That’s why I had the questions I had this\n              morning about whether if you’re telling me there really is a\n              life sentence without parole, if that is really true, if you\n              tell me in the courtroom that there is that option.\n\n      Q       . . . knowing that a person you might convict of an offense\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                        64\n\fin objecting to Vicar, pointed to her demeanor, her long pauses\n\nbefore answering questions, and her admission of equivocation.\n\nAlthough she stated she could envision circumstances in which she\n\nmight be able to impose a death sentence, the presence of the\n\nalternative of a life sentence without parole raised serious\n\nquestions about her ability to follow the law.               In addition, the\n\nwhole of her testimony could have left the court with the impres-\n\nsion that she favored the death penalty as a theoretical necessity,\n\nbut would not be able to recommend it.          The court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion     in   granting    the   challenge    for   cause    for   Vicar's\n\ninability to apply the death sentence.\n\n\n\n\n     34\n          (...continued)\n             like this is never going to be released, ever, period, and\n             he’s going to be in prison for the rest of his life, that\n             realistically you could never vote for the death penalty, then\n             you really need to let us know that now, okay?\n\n     A.

I guess I’m just torn between the fact of whether I thought\n             there were cases that I have heard of that I thought that’s\n             exactly what they deserved, but whether I couldSSwhether that\n             decisionSSI guess whether it conflicts with my religious\n             beliefs, whether that decision should really be up to me or\n             not.

He challenged veniremen\n\nDeanna Hailey and Carolyn Coffelt on the ground that they stated\n\nthat if they found Webster guilty of the primary offense of\n\nkidnaping resulting in death, they would have to answer “yes” to\n\nthe statutory aggravating factor that the defendant caused the\n\ndeath of the victim during a kidnaping.     Webster challenged Jimmy\n\nChambless, Kristi Magouirk, and David Hoffman because all allegedly\n\nwere biased in favor of finding him guilty during the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase.      The court denied these challenges, forcing\n\nWebster to use peremptory challenges in all five cases.       He now\n\nsays the denial of his for-cause challenges was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                   1.\n\n     The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial includes the right\n\nto an impartial jury.         Morgan v.

Nell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1229 (5th Cir. 1976) (“[A]s\na general rule it is error for a court to force a party to exhaust his peremptory\nchallenges on persons who should be excused for cause, for this has the effect of\nabridging the right to exercise peremptory challenges.”).\n\n                                       68\n\fduring the commission of the offense.38\n\n     This, Webster argues, runs afoul of Morgan, because Hailey\n\nwould fail to consider additional evidence before finding the\n\nstatutory factor.       In addition, Webster claims, Congress, when it\n\nprovided the aggravating factor, must have contemplated a juror's\n\nconsideration of something more than or different from the evidence\n\nat trial; otherwise, the aggravating factor would be superfluous.\n\nWe disagree; the court did not abuse its discretion in finding\n\nHailey unbiased and capable of serving.\n\n     First, Morgan does not apply here; it holds that a juror\n\nshould be excused if a finding of guilt automatically would lead\n\nhim to recommend a sentence of death.         See Morgan, 504 U.S. at 729.\n\nThe instant alleged error is a far cry from that in Morgan.            The\n\nproblem of which Webster complains is that a finding of guilt\n\nautomatically would lead to the finding of an aggravating fac-\n\ntor—not to a recommendation of death.           An automatic finding of an\n\naggravating factor in no way runs afoul of Morgan’s requirement\n\nthat a juror appears able to “consider the evidence of aggravating\n\nand mitigating circumstances as the instructions require him to\n\ndo,” id., because the automatic finding of an aggravating factor is\n\nnot the same as an inability to consider aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances.       A juror could find the aggravator of kidnaping\n\nresulting in death and yet determine that the mitigating factors\n\n\n     38\n          Hailey actually answered the question, “Yes, I guess so.”\n\n                                       69\n\foutweigh that and other aggravating factors, sparing the defen-\n\ndant’s life.39\n\n      Second, as we held in Jones and Hall, allowing a juror, having\n\nalready found the existence of a certain set of facts beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt during the guilt-innocence phase, to answer “yes”\n\nto an aggravating factor based on the same facts does not raise\n\nconstitutional problems.         See Hall, 152 F.3d at 416-17; Jones,\n\n132 F.3d at 248-49.      Indeed, it merely allows the jury to consider\n\nthe facts or elements of the offense as an aggravating factor that,\n\nhaving already been found beyond a reasonable doubt, it then\n\nweighsSSjust     onceSSin   determining      whether    to   return    a   death\n\nsentence.    Allowing the factor to be weighed does not violate the\n\nnarrow strictures of Morgan, even if a juror believes the finding\n\nof guilt automatically leads to a finding of the factor.\n\n      Finally, Hailey answered Webster’s hypothetical questions in\n\nignorance of the law the court would instruct her to apply.\n\nContrary to Webster’s assertion, she did not implicitly say she\n\nwould not follow instructions; to the contrary, she stated that she\n\nwould be able to follow the instructions and procedures.                     The\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in finding that she would obey\n\nthose instructions when informed how to determine the existence of\n\n\n      39\n         Cf. United States v.

I feel like there\n\nwas probably a good reason they were arrested.

We disagree;\n\nother statements Chambless made demonstrate the court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying the for-cause challenge.\n\n     When questioned by the court, Chambless agreed the verdict\n\nmust be based on the evidence presented in the courtroom, and\n\nbelieved he could limit himself to such evidence.   He affirmed that\n\nthe prosecution carries the burden of proving guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and would require as much with respect to every\n\nelement.   He also believed he could give a fair trial to both the\n\ndefense and the prosecution, putting his predisposition aside.

She also stated, “I am all for the death\n\npenalty.

So there has got to be something against him.”             She also\n\nrecounted news stories on the crime from as recently as the\n\nprevious day.        It “would be pretty hard” for her not to discuss the\n\ncase with her husband and not to keep up with the press accounts.\n\nDespite Webster’s claims that Magouirk showed bias and an inability\n\nto   follow    the    instructions,    the   court   deemed   her   capable   of\n\n                                        74\n\fserving.     We decline to second-guess that determination.\n\n     The decision is supported by ample evidence that, combined\n\nwith the court’s assessment of Magouirk's credibility, justifies\n\nits refusal to dismiss her for cause.         As explained, knowledge of\n\nthe case from news accounts does not preclude service, and Magouirk\n\nagreed she would follow the instructions to avoid the news, assume\n\nanything she heard outside the courtroom was false, and base her\n\ndecision solely on the evidence.          She recognized that the govern-\n\nment carried the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nShe stated, “I guess, since I haven’t heard any evidence, I don’t\n\nhave anything against him.

Until I hear\n\nthe facts, then he is innocent, yes.”         She affirmed that she would\n\nfollow her oath as a juror and the court’s instructions, including\n\nnot discussing the case with her husband.

Webster   believes   Hoffman\n\ndemonstrated bias resulting from Webster's being charged with the\n\noffense and an inability to separate the victim from thoughts of\n\nHoffman's own daughter.          Hoffman testified that, based on news\n\naccounts, he believed a girl named Lisa Rene was kidnaped, taken to\n\nArkansas, and murdered, even though those were the elements the\n\ngovernment would have to prove.           Recognizing the government had\n\n                                     75\n\fbrought charges, he admitted, “I guess for that reason alone I\n\nwould have to say that there’s a certain bias there, or else he\n\nwouldn’t be here.”       Hoffman also stated that he might find it\n\ndifficult to “wall off” thoughts of his daughter during sentencing,\n\nand they might affect his vote “to a certain extent.”\n\n     Hoffman said, however, “I believe that I would be able to\n\nforce [thoughts of my kids from my mind] and weigh purely on the\n\nevidence there.”43    He stated his view that much information coming\n\nfrom the media proved false.         He believed he could keep an open\n\nmind, follow his oath as a juror, and base his verdict and sentence\n\nrecommendation on the evidence and law.\n\n     A juror need not, and indeed cannot, leave his experiences and\n\ncircumstances outside the jury room.          What he must do is base a\n\ndecision solely on the evidence presented, as seen in a fair and\n\nunbiased manner through the lens of his experiences.           The district\n\ncourt found Hoffman excruciatingly honest, but dedicated to and\n\ncapable of overcoming any difficulties he might have as a juror.\n\nOn this cold appellate record, we cannot find that determination an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n\n     43\n         Hoffman demonstrated both the difficulty and, ultimately, his ability\nto make a decision based on the evidence and not on his feelings for his\nchildren:\n\n     Where I feel that I would have a harder time at that—walling that\n     off—is if a guilty verdict is determined and sentencing begins.\n     I would still, again, look at the individual evidence itself and\n     weigh all the circumstances, but just being a human being, I have\n     experiences and feelings, and that’s what makes us all individuals,\n     of course, and those feelings for my children would probably end up\n     coming out in some form in the sentencing.\n\n                                     76\n\f                                        I.\n\n     Before the jury retired for deliberations at the penalty\n\nphase,   the   court   excused    one    of   the   jurors   and   elevated   an\n\nalternate to replace him.

After extensive\n\ndiscussion with counsel for the defense and prosecution, the court\n\ndecided to substitute Fox with an alternate juror, Christopher\n\n\n                                        77\n\fRawlinson.   Rawlinson had sat through the guilt-innocence phase\n\nbut had neither participated in nor observed those jury delibera-\n\ntions; he also sat through the penalty phase testimony.              Webster\n\nmoved for a mistrial and objected to using an alternate juror; the\n\ncourt ruled against him. In the sentencing phase charge, the court\n\ninstructed the jurors, “As you will recall, a member of the jury\n\nwhich returned the verdict in the guilt phase of the trial was\n\nexcused for health reasons.     An alternate juror was substituted in\n\nhis place.

Webster\n\ncomplains only of the lack of authority to replace Fox with an\n\nalternate.\n\n     The court presented the parties with three alternatives:\n\ncontinue with eleven jurors, impanel an alternate, or declare a\n\nmistrial and impanel a new jury.       The court observed that “the law\n\n\n                                      78\n\fisn’t real clear” on how to proceed.         The prospect of repeating the\n\nentire penalty phase hearing made the last alternative highly\n\nunattractive, although that is the alternative Webster urged; he\n\nwould not stipulate to an eleven-member jury.\n\n     If this had taken place before the jury retired at the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase of the trial, the answer to the question would be\n\nsimple, for rule 24(c) provides that “alternate jurors in the order\n\nin which they are called shall replace jurors who, prior to the\n\ntime the jury retires to consider its verdict, become or are found\n\nto be unable or disqualified to perform their duties.” Rule 24(c)\n\nalso states, however, that all alternate jurors who have not\n\nreplaced a regular juror “shall be discharged after the jury\n\nretires to consider its verdict.”          Id.\n\n     When a juror is disqualified after the jury retires, on the\n\nother hand, the court has the authority to require the jury to\n\nproceed to verdict with only eleven members, with or without\n\nstipulation by the parties, and this should be done particularly in\n\nlengthy and complicated trials.44         We have explained our justifica-\n\ntion for proceeding with eleven jurors instead of substituting an\n\nalternate:\n\n     An alternate juror replacing a regular juror after the\n     jury has commenced its deliberations may be unable to\n     participate equally with the other jurors, because he\n\n\n     44\n         See FED.

There is\n      a danger that the other jurors will have already formu-\n      lated positions or viewpoints or opinions in the absence\n      of the alternate juror and then pressure the newcomer\n      into possibly ratifying this predetermined verdict, thus\n      denying the defendant the right to consideration of the\n      case by twelve jurors.\n\nUnited States v.

The FDPA provides that if the defendant is found\n\nguilty, the court\n\n      shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine\n      the punishment to be imposed.     The hearing shall be\n      conductedSS\n\n      (1) before the jury that determined the defendant’s guilt;\n\n      (2) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of the hearing\n      ifSS\n\n      ...\n\n            (C)    the jury that determined the defendants guilt\n                   was discharged for good cause\n\n            . . . .\n\n      A jury impaneled pursuant to paragraph (2) shall consist\n      of 12 members, unless, at any time before the conclusion\n      of the hearing, the parties stipulate, with approval of\n      the court, that it shall consist of a lesser number.\n\n§ 3593(b).45      How should a court apply rules 23 and 24, if at all,\n\n\n      45\n         This language allowing for the parties to stipulate to a jury of less\nthan 12 members is similar to former rule 23(b), which did not allow the court\nto order the case to proceed even absent stipulations.         Before changes to\nrule 23(b) in 1983, caselaw allowed a court to substitute an alternate juror even\nwhen deliberations had begun, if the parties refused to stipulate to a jury of\nfewer than 12 members.

Dec. 1981); FED. R. CRIM. P. 23(b), advisory committee note. In such a\ncase, the defendant had to show he was prejudiced by the use of the alternate\njuror. See Huntress, 956 F.2d at 1316.\n\n                                       80\n\fwhen the jury has returned from deciding one verdict but has yet to\n\nretire to consider the second?     This presents an issue of first\n\nimpression.\n\n     The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure apply to sentencing\n\nhearings; FED. R. CRIM. P. 1 provides, “These rules govern the\n\nprocedure in all criminal proceedings in the courts of the United\n\nStates . . . .”     Rule 54, FED. R. CRIM. P., excludes certain\n\nproceedings, but not sentencing hearings.    Section 3593(c) waives\n\nrule 32(c)’s presentence report requirement, which suggests the\n\nnegative implication that the Rules of Criminal Procedure usually\n\ndo apply to sentencing hearings under the FDPA. The district court\n\ncorrectly looked at rules 23 and 24, therefore, in deciding what to\n\ndo after excusing Fox.   But how should a court apply these rules in\n\nlight of the fact that they fail to contemplate a bifurcated\n\nproceeding?\n\n     If, hypothetically, the entire jury had been discharged for\n\ngood cause after returning its guilty verdict, the court would have\n\nimpaneled an entirely new one pursuant to § 3593(b)(2).     Presum-\n\nably, that jury would have included alternates.   If the court then\n\nhad discharged a juror for cause before the jury had retired to\n\nconsider the sentence, would the court have been entitled to\n\nelevate an alternate?     Rule 24(c) answers in the affirmative\n\n(alternate “shall replace” juror excused before jury retires).\n\n     The superficial conclusion, then, is that the court has the\n\nsame authority to impanel an alternate when the same jury sits for\n\n                                 81\n\fboth phases of the trial.        And this conclusion answers Webster’s\n\nprimary contention:       Because an alternate was available and the\n\njury had not retired to deliberate on its sentence recommendation,\n\nthe court had the authority, under rule 24(c), to elevate the\n\nalternate.\n\n       The answer, unfortunately, is not so facile, for rule 24(c)\n\nalso provides, “An alternate juror who does not replace a regular\n\njuror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider its\n\nverdict.”       This mandatory language appears to compel the court to\n\ndismiss the alternate jurors once the jury retires at the end of\n\nthe first phaseSSwhen the jury first retires to consider its\n\nverdict.       If the court were to follow this mandatory language, no\n\nalternates would remain to be substituted for jurors whom the court\n\nmight have to discharge before the end of the second phase.46                In\n\nfact, the court dismissed three of the five alternate jurors; the\n\nremaining two were retained for the penalty phase of the hearings.\n\n       The court erred in not dismissing the juror at the end of the\n\nfirst phase.       The mandatory language of rule 24(c) requires the\n\ncourt to dismiss the alternates when the jury retires to deliber-\n\nate.        This conclusion adheres faithfully to the language of the\n\nrules.\n\n       Nevertheless, we affirm the sentence.         Webster did not object\n\n\n\n       46\n         Webster points out that when the jury was first impaneled, the court\ninstructed that “once the deliberations begin, we will dismiss any alternate who\nhas not been seated as a primary juror.”\n\n                                      82\n\fto the failure to dismiss the alternates at the time; he complained\n\nonly of elevating an alternate to the jury and not granting a\n\nmistrial.47     Because the jury had not retired when the court\n\ndismissed Fox and substituted Rawlinson, any available alternate\n\ncould be elevated consistent with the rule.              Webster, therefore,\n\nwaived the objection he should have madeSSthe failure to dismiss\n\nthe alternates.       When the defendant has waived an objection for\n\nfailure to follow the substitution rules, an error alone does not\n\nwarrant reversal; we also review for prejudice from the resulting\n\nelevation of the substitute.48\n\n      Webster did not suffer prejudice. The court provided the jury\n\nwith an instruction to include the new juror equally in all\n\ndeliberations.     Furthermore, the jury had not started deliberating\n\nat the penalty phase.           Those issues were distinct from those\n\ndecided at the guilt-innocence phase; any overlap is irrelevant,\n\nbecause the jury specifically was instructed to consider everything\n\nas if for the first time.       Interestingly, on the sole penalty phase\n\nissue as to which prejudice seems possible, which is in the first\n\naggravating factor that overlapped with the offense decided in the\n\nfirst phaseSSkidnaping in which death resultsSSthe jury failed to\n\n\n\n      47\n         On appeal, Webster focuses on the same complaint.    In some places,\nhowever, he mentions the failure to dismiss the alternates when deliberations\nbegan at the guilt-innocence phase.\n\n      48\n        See Huntress, 956 F.2d at 1316-17 (holding that failure to make the proper\nobjection to violation of juror rules leads to review for prejudice in the\nsubstitution).\n\n                                       83\n\ffind the aggravating factor. Webster’s generic claims of prejudice\n\nfail, as there is nothing inherently prejudicial in a rule 24(c)\n\nviolation.   See Huntress, 956 F.2d at 1316 n.7.\n\n\n\n                                J.\n\n     Webster contends that the court erred in excusing juror Urbano\n\nGomez on learning that, in response to the juror questionnaire, he\n\nhad not disclosed past encounters with the judicial system.   At the\n\nvery least, Webster claims, the court erred by not recalling Gomez\n\nto ask him further questions.   We conclude the court acted within\n\nits discretion by dismissing Gomez, even absent further questioning\n\nto determine whether he had lied.\n\n\n\n\n                                84\n\f                                        1.\n\n      After the court qualified Gomez as a juror, the prosecutor\n\nnotified the court that it had uncovered a criminal record for him.\n\nThe government challenged Gomez for cause because he had not\n\nanswered his questionnaire truthfully.             The government presented\n\nevidence that Gomez had been charged with shoplifting and spent\n\nthree days in county jail, had been convicted of aggravated assault\n\non a police officer and received one month of confinement,49 and had\n\nbeen convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for which\n\nhe received five years' probation.           None of these was mentioned in\n\nGomez's answer to the questionnaire.50 Over defense objections, the\n\ncourt dismissed Gomez for providing false information, without\n\nrecalling him for questioning.\n\n\n\n                                        2.\n\n      The court has discretion to excuse an untruthful juror.51                The\n\n      49\n         The parties agree this must have been pled down to some lesser offense,\ngiven the punishment.\n\n      50\n         The most evident problem is with the response to Question 73, “Have you or\na relative been convicted of any offense other than a traffic ticket?” Gomez\nchecked “Yes,” and under “details” noted “brother-in-law, child abuse.” Five other\nquestions were answered inaccurately, given Gomez's record of arrests, convictions,\nand probation.\n\n      51\n         United States v.

(3) before the court alone, upon the motion of the\n\ndefendant and with the approval of the attorney for the govern-\n\nment.”       This provision refers only to the determination of the\n\nsentence; it is located in the section captioned “Special hearing\n\nto determine whether a sentence of death is justified.”                     It in no\n\nway implies that all court fact-finding must be on the defendant’s\n\nmotion.\n\n     Webster also asserts that, in the absence of a specific\n\nstatutory scheme, the only logical conclusion is that the jury must\n\nbe the fact-finder on the issue of mental retardation.                             This\n\n“logical” claim suffers from gaps in reasoning.\n\n     First, only §§ 3592 and 3593 address issues that a jury may be\n\ncalled on to consider.           Section 3592 lays out all of the factors\n\nfor the finder of fact to considerSSthe mitigating and aggravating\n\nfactors.      Section 3593 explains the procedure for the sentencing\n\n                                              95\n\fhearing, including laying out the options for who the fact-finder\n\nmay beSSjury, newly impaneled jury, or judge.\n\n       Section   3596   addresses   “Implementation        of   a   sentence   of\n\ndeath.” It is here that Congress chose to indicate its restriction\n\non who could be executed.          Placement of the consideration here,\n\nrather than in the earlier sections addressing the issues for the\n\njury   to   consider    in   imposing    the   sentence,    belies    Webster’s\n\nassertion that the issue obviously belongs to the jury.\n\n       In   addition,   although    Webster     did   request       and   receive\n\nsubmission of the mitigating factor that he “is or may be mentally\n\nretarded,” he did not request a jury instruction that placed in the\n\njury's hands the job of factually finding whether Webster is\n\nmentally retarded.       That the jury could consider whether Webster\n\n“is or may be retarded” falls woefully short of the factual finding\n\nrequired in § 3596 of mental retardation to prevent the implementa-\n\ntion of the death sentence.             The lack of a jury instruction\n\nrequest, along with failing to object to the factual finding,\n\nsuggests that Webster’s “logical assumption” placing this issue in\n\nthe jury’s hands was no more obvious to him at trial than it was to\n\nthe district court.\n\n       The statutory scheme simply does not answer who decides this\n\nissue, so we cannot say the court’s decision clearly contravened\n\nthe FDPA.     Given the lack of clarity, the court did not commit\n\nplain error in deciding the issue itself.\n\n\n\n                                        96\n\f                                      2.\n\n      Webster asserts that the procedure the court chose violated\n\ndue process and deprived him of effective assistance of counsel.\n\nNeither is true.       Webster rests these claims on the fact that the\n\ncourt acted without statutory authority and without notice to him.\n\nBare assertions aside, Webster provides no analysis as to why the\n\ncourt’s determination violates the Constitution.\n\n      The    alleged    denial   of   effective    assistance    of   counsel\n\npresumably rests on Webster’s lack of opportunity to present his\n\ncase.      Even assuming this rises to the level of constitutional\n\nerror, it is harmless.           Webster had just finished presenting\n\nvoluminous evidence to the jury, in support of his claim of mental\n\nretardation.62    The court had ample information before it to make\n\nits decision; indeed, just before the jury retired, Webster had\n\nasked the court to find him mentally retarded as a matter of law,\n\ntaking the mitigating factor out of the jury’s hands.                 Webster\n\nmakes no showing of prejudice to his substantial rights by arguing\n\nthere is something additional he would have presented to the court.\n\nThe court did not plainly err in failing to provide Webster with\n\nnotice, and did not deprive him of a fundamentally fair trial.\n\n\n\n                                      3.\n\n\n      62\n         Cf.

The standard of review for a finding that a defendant is\n\nnot mentally retarded under § 3596 presents an issue of first\n\nimpression.    Because it is a factual finding, we adopt the clearly\n\nerroneous standard.63\n\n      The government presented substantial evidence to support the\n\nfinding.

This contention stems\n\ndirectly from the FDPA’s requirement that a court of appeals “shall\n\nconsider whether the sentence of death was imposed under the\n\ninfluence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and\n\nwhether the evidence supports the special finding of the existence\n\nof an aggravating factor required to be considered under section\n\n3592.”   § 3595(c)(1).\n\n     Webster fails to distinguish between these two requirements as\n\ndistinct responsibilities of an appellate court.        Rather, he\n\nsuggests that the only way we can fulfill our responsibility under\n\nthe provision as a whole is to conduct “a de novo review and a\n\nbalancing of the evidence.” Any other method, Webster claims, will\n\n\n\n                                99\n\ffail to ferret out which verdicts were imposed under the impermis-\n\nsible factors.64 An appellate court, however, is a court of review.\n\nWe do not sit as a second jury.

Under Maynard v. Cartwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112084\"><a href=\"/opinion/112084/maynard-v-cartwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363-64\n\n(1988), the government may not make every unjustified intentional\n\nkilling qualify for the death penalty.             The FDPA does precisely\n\nthat, Webster argues, by making the four mental states of murder\n\naggravating    factors     that   qualify    the   defendant     for   capital\n\npunishment under § 3591(a).           Webster’s argument stems from a\n\n\n      70\n         Webster also asserts, without analysis, that the “substantial planning\nand premeditation” aggravator is impermissibly vague. His argument is foreclosed\nby our analysis of the same language in the analogous 21 U.S.C. § 848(e) death\npenalty scheme. See Flores, 63 F.3d at 1373-74.\n      71\n         Further, because the jury did not find the aggravator of which Webster\ncomplains, he cannot claim his sentence is impaired.\n\n                                      103\n\fmisreading of the statute.\n\n     As the government points out, § 3591(a) does not set forth a\n\nlist of   aggravating       factors,    but,       on   the   contrary,   serves a\n\ngatekeeping function.         Section 3591(a) codifies the command in\n\nEnmund, 458 U.S. at 797, and Tison, 481 U.S. at 157, to limit the\n\nimposition   of    the    death   penalty     to    those     murderers   who   both\n\nundertake felony participation and demonstrate at least reckless\n\nindifference to human life.           Satisfaction of these elements only\n\nbegins the death penalty inquiry; it does not and cannot establish\n\ndeath penalty eligibility by itself.               The limiting factors, which\n\nWebster   claims    are    lacking,    are,    of       course,   the   aggravating\n\ncircumstances set forth in § 3592(b) and (c), which guide the jury\n\nin its capital decision after it finds at least one element of\n\nintent under § 3591(a) as a threshold matter.\n\n\n\n                                       b.\n\n     Webster contends that the FDPA is unconstitutional because it\n\npermits the multiple weighing of aggravating factors (specifically,\n\nthe § 3591(a)(2) mens rea factors).            This argument stems from the\n\nsame fundamental misunderstanding of § 3591(a) discussed above. See\n\npart IV.N.2.a, supra; see also part IV.A.2, supra (discussing\n\n“double weighing”).       As we have explained, § 3591(a) does not set\n\nforth aggravating factors, but rather serves as a preliminary\n\nqualification threshold.          The fact that a defendant could satisfy\n\n\n                                       104\n\fmore than one of these via the same course of action does not,\n\ntherefore,      constitute    impermissible      double    counting.      Thus,\n\nalthough Webster is correct in noting that many courts have held\n\nthat “double counting” of aggravating factors is to be avoided, the\n\nFDPA does not present such a problem.72\n\n\n\n                                       c.\n\n       Webster asserts that by precluding consideration of “race,\n\ncolor, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant\n\nor of any victim” as a mitigating factor, the FDPA is unconstitu-\n\ntional. See § 3593(f). Webster correctly interprets the FDPA, but\n\nincorrectly interprets the Constitution; the FDPA can be constitu-\n\ntional only by precluding such factors.\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause protects from purposeful state\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.

Such a reading of Penry and Lockett is erroneous for\n\nat least two reasons:        It ignores the concept of relevancy, and it\n\nwould cause those cases to conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nfor the reasons discussed above.\n\n      Penry and Lockett hold that in capital sentencing, a defendant\n\nmust be permitted to introduce all “evidence relevant to the\n\ndefendant’s background or character . . . that mitigate against\n\nimposing the death penalty.”            Penry, 492 U.S. at 318 (emphasis\n\nadded).74    As a matter of law, race is “totally irrelevant to the\n\nsentencing process.”        Zant, 462 U.S. at 885; McCleskey, 481 U.S.\n\nat 316 (discussing the unconstitutionality of using the “irrelevant\n\nfactor of race” in sentencing).           Therefore, when the FDPA and the\n\nSupreme Court speak of “background or character” evidence, they\n\nobviously mean to permit, and can mean to permit only, the specific\n\nbeliefs and life experiences of the defendant in question.\n\n      Thus, although race per se is an irrelevant and inadmissible\n\nfactor, the effects and experiences of race may be admissible.

At the time of trial,\n\nSingleton had not yet been handed down.            Thus, the court did not\n\ncommit plain error when it did not follow a decision that had not\n\nyet been decided.       Moreover, even if Singleton had been decided\n\nbefore trial, decisions of other circuits are not binding on the\n\ncourts of this circuit, so according to the “current law” of this\n\ncircuit, the testimony of co-defendants still would have been\n\nadmissible.77\n\n      The best Webster can argue is that, at the time of his trial,\n\nthe applicability of § 201(c)(2) to government plea bargains in\n\nthis circuit was uncertain.78         “The uncertainty manifest in [an]\n\narea of the law illustrates that any error on the part of the trial\n\ncourt could not have been plain.”            Calverley, 37 F.3d at 165.\n\n\n\n      77\n         We recently agreed to review a claim that was not raised until appeal\nwhen we found there had been an intervening change in the law.

Unlike Webster, however, the appealing party in DSC\nCommunications relied on an intervening change in the law of this circuit,\nwhereas Webster relies on a vacated opinion of another circuit.\n      78\n         The uncertainty of this circuit’s law on this point is already\nanticipated in two recent district court decisions.

Fraguela, 1998 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 14347 (E.D. La. Aug. 27, 1998), the court granted a new trial and\nadopted the Singleton panel’s reading of § 201(c)(2).\n\n                                      112\n\f      Webster challenges a district court decision on the basis of\n\na new interpretation of an existing law even though no Fifth\n\nCircuit precedent directly supports his reading of § 201(c)(2).79\n\nAt most, he can support the uncertainty of § 201(c)(2)’s applica-\n\nbility to government plea bargains.          A court's failure to apply an\n\nuncertain interpretation of a statute is far from plain error.\n\nRather than finding plain error by adopting a new interpretation of\n\nan existing statute based on the vacated decision of another\n\ncircuit, we deny Webster’s challenge to the court’s failure to\n\nsuppress the testimony of his co-defendants.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n      79\n         Because we find no plain error in the failure to suppress the co-\ndefendants' testimony, we do not reach the question of the proper reading of\n§ 201(c)(2). A review of this circuit’s precedents shows, however, that we\nconsistently have upheld government efforts to provide benefits to witnesses in\nexchange for testimony when challenged on other grounds. The district court did\nnot err by conforming to this precedent.\n\n      In United States v.

We went on to point\nout that “courts uniformly hold that such a witness may testify so long as the\ngovernment’s bargain with him is fully ventilated so that the jury can evaluate\nhis credibility.” Id. Thus, our general rule has been to allow the government\nto confer benefits upon witnesses in exchange for testimony (even contingent\nmonetary compensation).\n\n      Along with our sister circuits, we also explicitly have upheld admitting\nthe testimony of witnesses who were promised reduced sentences.
