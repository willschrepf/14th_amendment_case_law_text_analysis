In a marital dissolution action, an appellate\n                     court reviews the case de novo on the record to determine whether there\n                     has been an abuse of discretion by the trial judge.\n                2.\t Judges: Words and Phrases. A judicial abuse of discretion exists if the\n                     reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriv-\n                     ing a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in matters\n                     submitted for disposition.\n                3.\t Contracts: Statutes: Appeal and Error. The construction of a contract\n                     and the meaning of a statute are questions of law which an appellate\n                     court reviews de novo.\n                4.\t Contracts: Stock. The general rules of contract construction apply to\n                     restrictive share agreements.\n                5.\t Contracts. If a contract’s terms are clear, a court may not resort to the\n                     rules of construction and must give the terms their plain and ordinary\n                     meaning as a reasonable person would understand them.\n                 6.\t ____. A court must consider a contract as a whole and, if possible, give\n                     effect to every part of the contract.\n                7.\t Divorce: Property Division. In a divorce action, the purpose of a\n                     property division is to distribute the marital assets equitably between\n                     the parties.\n                8.\t Property Division. Equitable property division is a three-step process.\n                     The first step is to classify the parties’ property as marital or nonmarital.\n                     The second step is to value the marital assets and marital liabilities of\n                     the parties. The third step is to calculate and divide the net marital estate\n                     between the parties.\n                 9.\t ____. The ultimate test in determining the appropriateness of a property\n                     division is fairness and reasonableness as determined by the facts of\n                     each case.\n\f                                     - 682 -\n                        Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                         292 Nebraska R eports\n                             BROZEK v.

Generally, the date on which a court values the marital estate\n     should be rationally related to the property composing the marital\n     estate.\n11.\t Divorce: Property Division. Generally, all property accumulated and\n     acquired by either spouse during a marriage is part of the marital\n     estate.\n12.\t ____: ____. The marital estate does not include property that a spouse\n     acquired before the marriage, or by gift or inheritance.\n13.\t ____: ____. Separate property becomes marital property by commin-\n     gling if it is inextricably mixed with marital property or with the sepa-\n     rate property of the other spouse.\n14.\t Property Division: Proof. The party claiming that property is nonmari-\n     tal has the burden of proving the property’s separate status.\n15.\t Statutes. A court gives statutory language its plain and ordinary\n     meaning.\n16.\t Statutes: Legislature: Intent. A court’s duty in interpreting a statute is\n     to determine and give effect to the Legislature’s purpose as ascertained\n     from the statute’s entire language considered in its plain, ordinary, and\n     popular sense.\n17.\t Divorce: Jurisdiction: Attorney Fees: Appeal and Error. An order\n     helping a party pay for his or her attorney’s work on appeal is an\n     order in aid of the appeal process under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 42-351(2)\n     (Reissue 2008).\n18.\t Divorce: Alimony. In considering alimony, a court should weigh four\n     factors: (1) the circumstances of the parties, (2) the duration of the mar-\n     riage, (3) the history of contributions to the marriage, and (4) the ability\n     of the party seeking support to engage in gainful employment without\n     interfering with the interests of any minor children in the custody of\n     each party.\n19.\t ____: ____. In addition to the specific criteria listed in Neb. Rev. Stat.\n     § 42-365 (Reissue 2008), a court should consider the income and earn-\n     ing capacity of each party and the general equities before deciding\n     whether to award alimony.\n20.\t Divorce: Property Division: Alimony. The statutory criteria for divid-\n     ing property and awarding alimony overlap, but the two serve different\n     purposes and courts should consider them separately.\n21.\t Divorce: Alimony.

SUMMARY\n   Shelley Jane Brozek and Kirk Steven Brozek separated,\nand the court later dissolved their marriage of about 20 years.\nThe decree divided the marital estate and ordered Kirk to\nbuy some of Shelley’s separate property. Kirk appeals, and\nShelley cross-appeals. Kirk argues that the court erred by\nordering him to buy Shelley’s shares in a closely held farming\ncorporation for an amount higher than the value determined\nunder a stock redemption agreement. He also argues that the\ncourt erred in dividing the marital estate, that it should have\ngiven him a credit for premarital property he disposed of\nduring the marriage, and that it lacked jurisdiction to award\nShelley attorney fees after he filed a notice of appeal. Shelley\nargues that the court should have awarded her alimony, a cash\naward for the inadequacy of the marital estate, and attorney\nfees. We affirm the decree and the order awarding Shelley\nattorney fees.\n\f                             - 684 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                       BROZEK v.

They have two\ndaughters, and Kirk adopted Shelley’s son from a prior mar-\nriage. The parties separated on December 24, 2011, after more\nthan 18 years together.\n   A month later, Shelley filed a dissolution complaint. When\nthe court tried the case in April 2014, Shelley was 50 and\nKirk was 47 years of age. Only one of their children was still\na minor.\n   Kirk has farmed since he graduated from college in 1986.\nHe farms with his father, brother, and adopted son.\n   Before Shelley married Kirk, she worked as a grocery clerk\nand secretary, and she also worked in sales. She did not pursue\neducation beyond high school and testified that her marriage to\nKirk did not interrupt her education or career.\n   Shelley stated she and Kirk were in “total agreement” that\nshe would not work outside the home. She maintained the\nmarital home, brought meals and equipment parts to the field,\nmowed and sprayed pasture, and helped put up hay on a few\nsmall tracts. Kirk’s brother, though, testified that Shelley sel-\ndom helped with the farming operation and “was mostly in\nthe way.”\n                      2. The Corporations\n   Kirk’s farming is interwoven with two closely held corpora-\ntions. The first, Brozek & Sons, Inc., is “the operating entity\nof the farming operation.” It owns the land, sells the grain, and\npays the Brozeks and others for their services. Its largest asset\nis about 3,400 acres of land. Kirk and his brother personally\nrent some of Brozek & Sons’ land, but the corporation “also\noperate[s] some of its own ground.”\n   The other corporation is Brozek Farms, Inc., which is “prin-\ncipally an equipment company.” It leases the equipment it\nowns to Brozek & Sons.\n   Kirk and Shelley are shareholders of both Brozek & Sons\nand Brozek Farms. Kirk’s parents gifted him shares of Brozek\n\f                              - 685 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                        BROZEK v. BROZEK\n                        Cite as 292 Neb. 681\n\n& Sons before and during the marriage. Shelley testified that\nshe received her shares by gift during the marriage. Kirk has\n75,541.67 shares, and Shelley has 12,000 shares of Brozek &\nSons, comprising stakes of about 21 percent and 3 percent,\nrespectively. Kirk has 437.5 shares, and Shelley has 62.5\nshares of Brozek Farms.\n   Kirk, Shelley, and the other shareholders of Brozek & Sons\nsigned a “Redemption Agreement” in 2003. The agreement\nstates that no sale, assignment, or other disposition of Brozek\n& Sons shares is valid unless made under the agreement.\n   At trial, the parties disputed the meaning of two paragraphs\nof the agreement. The second paragraph provides:\n      Transfer to Related Stockholder. Anything in this agree-\n      ment to the contrary notwithstanding, a Stockholder may\n      at any time or from time to time transfer all or any part\n      of his stock to his spouse, one or more of his children, or\n      a trustee or custodian for the exclusive benefit of himself,\n      his spouse, or his issue . . . .\nThe third paragraph provides: “Sale During Life. A Stockholder\ndesiring, during his lifetime, to sell or otherwise encumber his\nstock shall make a written offer to sell to [Brozek & Sons]\nupon the following terms and conditions, and [Brozek & Sons]\nshall purchase all of such shares of stock . . . .” The original\nprice was $8.50 per share, but Kirk testified that the Brozek &\nSons board increased it to $12 in 2013.\n   Shelley testified that she did not want to remain a share-\nholder of either Brozek & Sons or Brozek Farms because\n“I don’t think that would be reasonable.” Kirk testified that\nhe did not want to purchase Shelley’s Brozek & Sons shares\nfor a price above the value determined under the redemp-\ntion agreement.\n   In contrast to Brozek & Sons, there is no redemption agree-\nment for Brozek Farms. Kirk testified that he was willing to\nbuy Shelley’s Brozek Farms shares at a price determined by\nthe court.\n   Kirk and Shelley hired experts to appraise their Brozek &\nSons and Brozek Farms shares using a net asset approach.\n\f                              - 686 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                        BROZEK v. BROZEK\n                        Cite as 292 Neb. 681\n\nShelley’s expert valued a minority share of Brozek & Sons at\n$50 in August 2011 and August 2012. He valued a minority\nshare of Brozek Farms at $341 in August 2011 and $290 in\nAugust 2012. As of December 24, 2011, Kirk’s expert valued\nShelley’s Brozek & Sons shares at about $34 each and her\nBrozek Farms shares at about $270 each. Shelley’s expert\nreviewed the reports of Kirk’s expert and testified that the main\ndifferences were the valuation dates and the discounts for lack\nof control and marketability.\n\n                 3. Disputed Personal Property\n   Because Brozek & Sons held the land, Kirk and Shelley\ndid not own any real estate. But they did accumulate signifi-\ncant personal property during the marriage, including several\nhorses. Shelley could not remember how many horses she and\nKirk had when they separated, but she thought there might\nhave been six. She did not possess any of the horses at the time\nof trial because her current residence lacked facilities.\n   In Kirk’s “Statement of Financial Condition” as of December\n31, 2011, he said that he had “Horses 7 head” but named only\nsix animals. In a “2011 Depreciation and Amortization Report,”\nKirk included a “Horse/MH” in addition to the six horses he\nnamed in his “Statement of Financial Condition.” Kirk had\ntaken depreciation on all of the horses except one.\n   Kirk valued the horses at $12,600. Shelley suggested that\nthe court include half of the horses’ value in the marital estate\nand award the horses to Kirk.\n   The parties acquired a horse trailer during their marriage.\nShelley possessed the trailer at the time of trial but did not\nwant it because she did not have any horses. Kirk stated that\nhe did not want the trailer.\n   Shelley and Kirk also bought automobiles during their mar-\nriage, including a 2004 Ford pickup truck. Kirk was driving\nthe truck when he and Shelley separated but said that their\nadult daughter was driving it at the time of trial. Shelley testi-\nfied that their adult daughter drove, but did not own, the truck,\n\f                              - 687 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                        BROZEK v. BROZEK\n                        Cite as 292 Neb. 681\n\nwhich was “part of the whole package of vehicles that Kirk\nand I own.”\n\n                  4. K irk’s Premarital Property\n   Kirk attempted to identify and trace a significant amount of\npremarital personal property. For items that he no longer had at\nhis separation from Shelley, Kirk asked for a “credit or set-off”\nagainst the marital estate.\n   Kirk’s alleged premarital property included two checking\naccounts. He used one for household use and the other for\nfarm use. Kirk said that the farm account had about $79,000\nwhen he married Shelley. He added Shelley’s name to both\naccounts after their marriage, and they used the accounts until\nthey separated.\n   For the premarital machinery that he had sold or traded in,\nKirk wanted a credit against the marital estate. He submitted\nevidence of the purchase price of the machinery, which he said\nwas evidence of its “value” because his equipment held its\nvalue as it aged or even appreciated. But he acknowledged that\nfarm equipment generally depreciates.\n   The premarital machinery that Kirk no longer possessed\nincluded two tractors, a disk, a cultivator, a fertilizer spreader,\nand a drill. Kirk testified that he sold or traded in each of these\nitems at some point but could not remember what consideration\nhe received. He remembered using the trade-in value of a pre-\nmarital shredder and an unspecified amount of “cash boot” to\nacquire a different shredder in 2011. Asked what the trade-in\nvalue for the shredder was, Kirk took “a guess that my memory\nis $3,500.” He said he kept “unique files for each unique item\nof equipment,” but files matching that description are not in\nthe record.\n   Finally, Kirk wanted a “bushel for bushel set-off,” or at least\na credit, for the crops he harvested in 1993. He said he farmed\na particular number of acres of corn, popcorn, and soybeans in\n1993. Using an “average [yield] of the area of the other fields\nin the area,” he estimated how many bushels he harvested, and\n\f                             - 688 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                       BROZEK v. BROZEK\n                       Cite as 292 Neb. 681\n\nvalued them at $190,000. Kirk used the proceeds of his 1993\nharvest to “reinvest[] my cash fund, and inventory of grain to\nfund the next years crop” and “rolled such investments, year to\nyear, from 1993 through December 24, 2011.”\n                  5. Parties’ Income and Their\n                 Postseparation Circumstances\n   Most of Shelley and Kirk’s income came from Kirk’s per-\nsonal farming activities and the salaries he drew from Brozek\n& Sons and Brozek Farms. According to Kirk’s W-2 wage\nand tax statements, he received combined wages from Brozek\n& Sons and Brozek Farms of $31,800 in 2008, $33,600 in\n2009, and $33,600 in 2010. Brozek & Sons also paid the\nfamily’s health insurance premiums, telephone bills, Internet\nbills, and fuel costs. Brozek & Sons also let Kirk and Shelley\nlive rent free in a house owned by the corporation. Kirk said\nhis annual net farm income with straight-line depreciation\nwas about $35,600 in 2008; $124,000 in 2009; and $77,400\nin 2010.\n   After their separation, Kirk continued to farm and Shelley’s\npursuits varied. She found employment with a large hog pro-\nducer caring for “reject pigs” that had “something wrong with\nthem.” Once the pigs put on weight, Shelley and the producer\nsold them and split any profits.\n   Shelley also sold a few steers from her cattle herd. She took\nabout 24 cows and 17 calves with her when she left the marital\nhome in December 2011. Shelley had maintained the herd but\ncould not grow it because of financial constraints. Her hope\nwas to support herself by growing the herd, but she needed\nmore pasture.\n   Outside of her livestock operation, Shelley has done some\n“odd jobs” for friends. She thought that the only other jobs\navailable to her in the area were those paying around minimum\nwage. She estimated that her living expenses were $5,160\nper month.\n   According to her separately filed federal tax returns, Shelley\nhad a total income of about $17,200 in 2012 and $17,600 in\n\f                             - 689 -\n                  Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                   292 Nebraska R eports\n                       BROZEK v. BROZEK\n                       Cite as 292 Neb. 681\n\n2013. According to Kirk’s federal tax return, he lost $13,000\nin 2012.\n                           6. Decree\n   In September 2014, the court entered its operative decree\ndissolving the parties’ marriage. It determined that Kirk and\nShelley’s Brozek & Sons and Brozek Farms shares were\ntheir separate property. But Kirk should nevertheless buy\nShelley’s shares in both corporations because leaving them in\nShelley’s hands “would be impractical and lead to an inequi-\ntable result.”\n   The court valued Shelley’s Brozek & Sons shares at $50\neach and her Brozek Farms shares at $315.50 each. It stated\nthat the appraisals of Shelley’s expert reflected the “current\nmarket value closest to the date of trial” and were more persua-\nsive than the opinions of Kirk’s expert.\n   The court ordered Kirk to pay Shelley $600,000 for her\n12,000 shares of Brozek & Sons and $19,718.75 for her 62.5\nshares of Brozek Farms. And, on the issue that has largely\ndriven this appeal, it found that the redemption agreement\ndid not apply to Kirk’s purchase of the Brozek & Sons shares\nbecause the agreement, by its terms, did not apply to transfers\nbetween spouses.\n   The court rejected Kirk’s attempts to trace his premarital\nproperty. Regarding the checking accounts, it stated that the\nfunds “have been so commingled that it is not practicable to\nattempt to separate them to any logical end.” Similarly, giving\nKirk a credit for the value of the premarital machinery that he\ntraded in during the marriage would require speculation. Nor\nwas Kirk entitled to a “grain-for-grain credit” for his 1993\nharvest. He only estimated the number of bushels he actually\nharvested. Plus, the court was not persuaded that “after nearly\n20 years of marriage the [market] value of the grain was not\ncompletely commingled in the years that farming operations\nwere not as profitable as when they were more so.”\n   The court valued the parties’ net marital estate at about\n$2.5 million, nearly $2.4 million of which it awarded to Kirk.\n\f                                    - 690 -\n                        Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                         292 Nebraska R eports\n                             BROZEK v. BROZEK\n                             Cite as 292 Neb. 681\n\nThe most substantial items were about $1.2 million of crops\nheld in storage in December 2011 and $485,000 of machin-\nery. The court determined that funds in both the household\nand farm checking accounts on December 23 and 24, 2011,\nwere marital property. It awarded Kirk the 2004 Ford pickup,\nthe horse trailer, and “7 head of horses valued at $6,300.” It\nawarded Shelley 36 head of cattle valued at about $40,000.\nTo equalize the marital estate, the court ordered Kirk to pay\nShelley about $1.1 million.\n   Shelley argued that she should receive additional compensa-\ntion because the corporate ownership of farming assets made\nthe marital estate inadequate. The court referred to Shelley’s\nrequest as one for a “Grace award” under our decision in Grace\nv. Grace.1 The court declined Shelley’s invitation, emphasizing\nthat the marital estate was substantial and that Kirk’s average\nincome from 2009 to 2011 was $96,000. Furthermore, Shelley\nwould be compensated for the effort she and Kirk put into\nthe Brozek family corporations through the forced sale of her\nshares to Kirk for about $620,000.\n   The court similarly denied Shelley’s request for $3,000\nper month of alimony for 10 years. It acknowledged “a great\ndisparity in incomes of the parties.” But it concluded that\nthe marriage had not interrupted Shelley’s career or educa-\ntional pursuits and that she would not have to delay any such\npursuits to care for the children, the youngest of which was\nnearly the age of majority. Plus, the court noted that Shelley\nwould receive cash for her shares in the Brozek corporations\nand a large equalization payment: “This will, as a natural\nconsequence, reduce [Kirk’s] earning capacity and likewise\nincrease [Shelley’s] earning capacity due to access to over\n$1,887,984.00 in cash or assets for investment in her cattle\nherd or otherwise.”\n   The court ordered each party to pay their own attorney fees\nand costs.\n\n 1\t\n      Grace v.

About 2\nweeks later, Shelley filed a “Motion for Temporary Relief\nPending Appeal.” Because she had not paid any of her attor-\nney fees yet, she asked for “a reasonable amount of attor-\nneys’ fees to allow for her defense of [Kirk’s] appeal.” The\ncourt sustained Shelley’s motion and awarded her $10,000 of\n“[t]emporary attorney fees.”\n   Kirk filed a notice of appeal from the court’s order on\nShelley’s motion for temporary relief. We sustained his motion\nto consolidate the two appeals for briefing and disposition.\n\n                III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Kirk assigns, restated, that the court erred by (1) ordering\nhim to buy Shelley’s Brozek & Sons shares at a price contrary\nto the redemption agreement; (2) not valuing Shelley’s Brozek\n& Sons and Brozek Farms shares as of the date of the parties’\nseparation; (3) awarding him the horse trailer, the 2004 Ford\npickup, and the horses; (4) not giving him a credit against the\nmarital estate for the value of his premarital checking accounts,\nmachinery, and crops; and (5) awarding Shelley attorney fees\nafter he appealed from the decree.\n   On cross-appeal, Shelley assigns that the court erred by not\nawarding her (1) alimony, (2) a Grace award, and (3) attorney\nfees in the decree.\n\n                  IV.

K irk’s A ppeals\n                   (a) Redemption Agreement\n   Kirk argues that the redemption agreement should control\nthe price he pays for Shelley’s Brozek & Sons shares. The\nthird paragraph of the agreement provides that shareholders\nwho wish to sell their shares must offer them to the corpora-\ntion at a price determined under the agreement. At the time\nof trial, that price was $12 per share. But the court decided\nthat the repurchase provision in the third paragraph did not\napply, because a sale between Kirk and Shelley was a trans-\nfer to a related stockholder under the second paragraph of\nthe agreement.\n   Stock transfer restrictions, such as redemption agreements,\nare generally enforceable under Nebraska law.5 A transfer of\nshares contrary to a restrictive agreement is voidable in equity.6\nBut we have not yet considered redemption agreements in a\nmarital dissolution action.\n   When dividing marital property, most courts do not treat\na redemption agreement as conclusive evidence of a share’s\nvalue.7 Instead, a majority consider the price in the agreement\n\n 4\t\n      See, Cain v.

As\nthe court noted, the mandatory redemption provision in the\nthird paragraph of the agreement is preceded by an exception\nin the second paragraph for transfers between related share-\nholders: “Anything in this agreement to the contrary notwith-\nstanding, a Stockholder may at any time or from time to time\ntransfer all or any part of his stock to his spouse . . . .” The\ncourt reasoned that Kirk and Shelley were still spouses, so\nit could order Kirk to buy Shelley’s shares under the second\nparagraph notwithstanding the redemption provision in the\nthird paragraph.\n   [4-6] The general rules of contract construction apply to\nrestrictive share agreements.11 If a contract’s terms are clear,\na court may not resort to the rules of construction and must\ngive the terms their plain and ordinary meaning as a reason-\nable person would understand them.12 A court must consider a\ncontract as a whole and, if possible, give effect to every part\nof the contract.13\n   We agree with the trial court that Kirk could buy Shelley’s\nshares notwithstanding the redemption provision in the third\nparagraph of the agreement. The second paragraph states\nthat shareholders can “transfer” their shares to their spouse\n“[a]nything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding.”\n\n 8\t\n      See, e.g., Barton v.

Instead,\nhe complains that the court required him to pay too much\nfor them.

And he\nargues that the court should not have awarded him the entire\nvalue of the 2004 Ford pickup truck because their adult daugh-\nter drove the truck.\n   [7-9] In a divorce action, the purpose of a property divi-\nsion is to distribute the marital assets equitably between the\nparties.20 Equitable property division is a three-step process.21\nThe first step is to classify the parties’ property as marital or\nnonmarital.22 The second step is to value the marital assets and\nmarital liabilities of the parties.23 The third step is to calculate\nand divide the net marital estate between the parties.24 The\nultimate test in determining the appropriateness of a property\ndivision is fairness and reasonableness as determined by the\nfacts of each case.25\n   We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by\ndistributing the horse trailer, horses, and pickup truck to Kirk.\nThe court had a good reason for not awarding the horse trailer\nto Shelley: she did not have any horses. Contrary to Kirk’s\nargument, Shelley did not ask the court to award her the horse\ntrailer. She testified that she did not have much use for a horse\ntrailer but that “[i]f the Court feels that I need that trailer, then\nso be it.”\n   The court did not err by awarding the horses to Kirk,\nbecause Shelley lacked the facilities to keep them. Nor did\nthe court abuse its discretion by assigning the horses a value\nof $6,300.

Kirk\nargues that the decree, which included “7 head of horses” in the\nmarital estate, “awards more horses than exist.”26 Asked how\nmany horses she and Kirk had when they separated, Shelley\ntestified, “Six, maybe, or something. I don’t know.” But Kirk\nsaid in his December 2011 “Statement of Financial Condition”\nthat he had “Horses 7 head,” and his “2011 Depreciation and\nAmortization Report” seems to list seven different horses. So\nthe record supports the court’s finding that the parties had\nseven horses.\n    Finally, the court did not abuse its discretion by including\nthe 2004 Ford pickup truck in the marital estate and awarding\nit to Kirk. Kirk does not dispute that he and Shelley bought the\ntruck during the marriage with marital funds. And he testified\nthat he was driving the truck when he and Shelley separated.\nEven if the parties were allowing their adult daughter to drive\nthe truck at the time of trial, she was not the owner. So this fact\ndid not oblige the court to “neutralize[]” the truck for equitable\ndistribution purposes.27\n\n                       (c) Valuation Date\n   Kirk argues that the court should have used the separation\ndate instead of the trial date to value “the assets.”28 He states\nthat he and Shelley “stayed away from one another” after\nDecember 24, 2011, and suggests that “[t]he assets are not\nmore related to the trial date than the separation date.”29\n   [10] Generally, the date on which a court values the marital\nestate should be rationally related to the property composing\nthe marital estate.30 But as Shelley notes, the court actually\nvalued much of the marital property on the separation date.

The values that\nthe court used for automobiles, trailers, cattle, snowmobiles,\nand other personal property match those in Shelley’s “Marital\nBalance Sheet” and Kirk’s “Statement of Financial Condition,”\nwhich are dated December 24 and 31, 2011. An exception is\nthe parties’ farm equipment, for which the court accepted the\nvalues from an appraisal dated December 12, 2012. But Kirk\nput that appraisal in evidence, so he can hardly complain about\nthe court’s using it.\n   Kirk’s main complaint is that the court should have used\nhis appraisal of Shelley’s corporate shares, which valued them\non the date of separation. The court found Shelley’s apprais-\nals more persuasive, in part, because they were “reflective of\nthe current market value closest to date of trial.” The shares\nwere Shelley’s nonmarital property, and we are not aware of\nany authority requiring a court to value nonmarital corporate\nshares as of the date when the acrimony between two share-\nholders reached a boiling point. Shelley’s expert testified\nthat appraisers generally prefer the most recent information\nbecause the value of a corporation’s assets can fluctuate.\nKirk counters that a “price-spike” occurred between the\ndates of separation and trial which, in hindsight, proved to\nbe “a short-term artificial run-up in land values.”31 Even if\nKirk is correct, the court had no way of knowing what the\nfuture held.\n\n                (d) Tracing of Premarital Assets\n   Kirk argues that the court should have given him a credit\nagainst the marital estate for the value of some of his pre-\nmarital property.

And, for the retirement accounts, the court awarded\nKirk a portion of their value that is substantially higher than\nthe value that Kirk claims in his brief. He specifically argues\nthat the court should have given him a credit for the value of\n(1) the premarital portion of the farm checking account, (2)\nthe crops from his 1993 harvest, and (3) the machinery he\nowned at the time of his marriage. We restrict our review to\nthose issues.33\n   [11-14] Generally, all property accumulated and acquired by\neither spouse during a marriage is part of the marital estate.34\nExceptions include property that a spouse acquired before the\nmarriage, or by gift or inheritance.35 Setting aside nonmarital\nproperty is simple if the spouse possesses the original asset,\nbut can be problematic if the original asset no longer exists.36\nSeparate property becomes marital property by commingling\nif it is inextricably mixed with marital property or with the\nseparate property of the other spouse.37 If the separate property\nremains segregated or is traceable into its product, commin-\ngling does not occur.38 The burden of proof rests with the party\nclaiming that property is nonmarital.39\n   After reviewing the record, we conclude that Kirk did not\ntrace the value of the premarital funds in the farm checking\naccount, the crops from his 1993 harvest, or the premari-\ntal machinery. He cites an armful of exhibits and concludes\nthat “[t]he evidence is of direct, concrete documents that\n\n33\t\n      See In re Claims Against Pierce Elevator, supra note 17.\n34\t\n      Coufal v.

And, after reviewing the evidence, we cannot follow\nthe threads in the hodgepodge of figures.\n   For the farm checking account, Kirk presented evidence of\nits value before the marriage and its value on the separation\ndate. Between those two points, Shelley became an account\nholder and Kirk made an unknown number of deposits and\nwithdrawals. Kirk did not present any evidence of the with-\ndrawal amounts during the marriage. Without any evidence\nof what withdrawals the parties made during the marriage,\n“the overwhelming likelihood is that tracing of withdrawals is\nnot possible.”41\n   Similarly, Kirk did not show what form his 1993 crops had\ntaken by the time he and Shelley separated. He said that he\n“rolled” the proceeds of his 1993 harvest into the next years’\ncrop, a process which he repeated each year through 2011.\nThe proceeds of the 1993 harvest were therefore mixed with\nthe proceeds of marital harvests and subject to the vicissitudes\nof the farming economy for nearly 20 years. Besides, Kirk\ncould not show the number of bushels he actually harvested in\n1993. He instead relied on an estimate using average yields for\nthe area.\n   For his premarital machinery, Kirk argues that we should\nrequire less specificity because “tracing the value of continu-\nously traded-in equipment would be futile.”42 He analogizes\nhis farm machinery to the cattle herd which the Nebraska\nCourt of Appeals treated as a single asset in Shafer v. Shafer.43\nThere, the husband brought into the marriage 116 head of\ncattle worth about $60,000. By the time of trial, the herd\n\n40\t\n      Brief for appellant at 31.\n41\t\n      See 1 Brett R.

The husband testified\nthat he continuously replaced the livestock as he sold them\nand that the herd gradually grew throughout the marriage,\nexcept for a brief period of drought. The husband sought a\n“set-aside” against the marital estate for the value of his pre-\nmarital cattle.44\n   The Court of Appeals “view[ed] the cattle herd as in effect\na single asset—rather than taking a ‘cow by cow’ approach.”45\nThe husband had sold his premarital cows, but the herd itself\npersisted through the roughly 13-year marriage:\n      while an individual cow which [the husband] owned in\n      1991 was long ago turned into hamburger, hot dogs, and\n      shoe leather and thus is not traceable, the cattle herd\n      itself, which has always been part of [the husband’s]\n      farming operation, is in fact traceable. To do otherwise\n      seems to us to exalt form over substance and ignore the\n      equitable nature of a dissolution action.46\nThe Court of Appeals decided that the trial court should have\ngiven the husband a $60,000 credit against the marital estate\nfor the premarital portion of the herd.\n   We conclude that Kirk’s premarital machinery is distin-\nguishable from the cattle herd in Shafer. A cow-and-calf herd\nis often a self-sustaining body: it produces calves each year,\nabout half of which are heifers that eventually have calves of\ntheir own. The same cannot be said about farm equipment. The\ncoupling of a tractor and grain cart will not produce a lawn-\nmower next spring.\n   Ideally, to trace the value of an item of premarital machin-\nery that Kirk traded in during the marriage, we would have\nevidence of the ratio of marital-to-nonmarital funds he used\nto acquire the new asset.47 With one exception, Kirk t­estified\n\n44\t\n      Id. at 177, 741 N.W.2d at 178.\n45\t\n      Id. at 178, 741 N.W.2d at 179.\n46\t\n      Id.\n47\t\n      See 1 Turner, supra note 41, § 5:61.\n\f                                     - 701 -\n                         Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                          292 Nebraska R eports\n                              BROZEK v.

He was able to\n“guess” he received $3,500 for a premarital shredder which he\napplied toward the purchase price of a new shredder. A spouse\ncan establish a “tracing link” through his own testimony,48 but\nthe court was entitled to discount Kirk’s testimony about the\nshredder because of his admitted uncertainty.\n   To summarize, as the spouse claiming a credit for nonmari-\ntal property, Kirk had the burden to show what portion of the\nparties’ machinery was attributable to his premarital assets.\nKirk did not meet his burden. We are aware that, in Bussell\nv. Bussell,49 the Court of Appeals applied its reasoning from\nShafer to premarital farm equipment exchanged for different\nfarm equipment during the marriage. But we do not know\nwhat evidence the record contained in Bussell. To the extent\nthat Bussell is inconsistent with this opinion, we disapprove\nof it.\n\n                   (e) Postappeal Attorney Fees\n   Kirk argues that the court lacked jurisdiction to award\nShelley $10,000 of attorney fees after he filed a notice of\nappeal from the decree. Shelley contends that the court retained\njurisdiction to award her attorney fees for her lawyer’s antici-\npated work on appeal.\n   Generally, a trial court loses jurisdiction once a party\nappeals.50 But Neb. Rev. Stat. § 42-351(2) (Reissue 2008) cre-\nates several exceptions in dissolution cases:\n      When final orders relating to [domestic relations actions]\n      are on appeal and such appeal is pending, the court that\n      issued such orders shall retain jurisdiction to provide for\n      such orders regarding support, custody, parenting time,\n      visitation, or other access, orders shown to be necessary\n\n48\t\n      Id., § 5:63 at 639.\n49\t\n      Bussell v.

Shelley argues that an award to help pay\nfor her attorney’s work on appeal was an “appropriate order[]\nin aid of the appeal process” under § 42-351(2).\n   [15,16] We give statutory language its plain and ordinary\nmeaning.51 Our duty is to determine and give effect to the\nLegislature’s purpose as ascertained from the statute’s entire\nlanguage considered in its plain, ordinary, and popular sense.52\n   [17] We conclude that an order helping a party pay for his\nor her attorney’s work on appeal is an “order[] in aid of the\nappeal process.” The court therefore had jurisdiction under\n§ 42-351(2) to award Shelley attorney fees after Kirk appealed\nfrom the decree. Nor can we say that the amount of the award\nwas an abuse of discretion. The issues raised by the parties\nbelow warranted an assumption that the appellate work would\nbe substantial.\n                  2. Shelley’s Cross-A ppeals\n                          (a) Alimony\n   [18,19] Shelley argues that the court abused its discretion\nby not awarding her alimony. In considering alimony, a court\nshould weigh four factors: (1) the circumstances of the parties,\n(2) the duration of the marriage, (3) the history of contribu-\ntions to the marriage, and (4) the ability of the party seeking\nsupport to engage in gainful employment without interfering\nwith the interests of any minor children in the custody of\neach party.53 In addition to the specific criteria listed in Neb.\n\n51\t\n      Pettit v.

BROZEK\n                                Cite as 292 Neb. 681\n\nRev. Stat. § 42-365 (Reissue 2008), a court should consider\nthe income and earning capacity of each party and the gen-\neral equities.54\n   [20] The statutory criteria for dividing property and award-\ning alimony overlap, but the two serve different purposes and\ncourts should consider them separately.55 The purpose of a\nproperty division is to distribute the marital assets equitably\nbetween the parties.56 The purpose of alimony is to provide for\nthe continued maintenance or support of one party by the other\nwhen the relative economic circumstances and the other crite-\nria enumerated in § 42-365 make it appropriate.\n   Shelley emphasizes that she was married to Kirk for 18\nyears before they separated and that his income far exceeds\nhers. She contributed to the marriage by raising the children\nand doing the “things that a typical Nebraska farm wife does\non a day to day basis.”57 Her goal is to support herself by\ngrowing her cattle herd, and she estimated that it might take 10\nyears for her to do so. She suggests that alimony of $3,000 per\nmonth for 10 years would be reasonable.\n   [21] We conclude that the court did not abuse its discre-\ntion by declining to award Shelley alimony. The length of the\nmarriage and disparity of incomes favors an award. But the\nmarriage did not interrupt Shelley’s career or education, and\nshe will not have any childcare duties to hamper her career or\neducational pursuits after the marriage. At the time of trial,\nshe planned to support herself by growing her cattle herd. The\nmain obstacle to increasing her stock was Shelley’s lack of\ncapital, so the court was justified in considering the substan-\ntial amount of money that she will receive from Kirk’s pur-\nchase of her corporate shares and the payment to equalize the\n\n54\t\n      See id.\n55\t\n      § 42-365.\n56\t\n      Id.\n57\t\n      Brief for appellee on cross-appeal at 32.\n\f                                    - 704 -\n                        Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                         292 Nebraska R eports\n                             BROZEK v.

Shelley notes that the division\nof the marital estate and the award of alimony are separate\ninquiries under § 42-365. But that does not mean that a party’s\nresources are irrelevant to her need for alimony. In weigh-\ning a request for alimony, the court may take into account\nall of the property owned by the parties when entering the\ndecree, whether accumulated by their joint efforts or acquired\nby inheritance.58\n\n                       (b) “Grace Award”\n   Shelley argues that the court should have given her addi-\ntional compensation for the inadequacy of the marital estate.\nShe emphasizes that Kirk received a small salary relative to\nBrozek & Sons’ revenue and that the marital estate would have\nbeen larger if Kirk had received a higher salary. Kirk contends\nthat Shelley is not entitled to additional compensation because\nshe “departs this marriage with substantial assets.”59\n   As noted, property received by gift or inheritance is usu-\nally not part of the marital estate. But in Van Newkirk v. Van\nNewkirk,60 we recognized an exception if both spouses have\ncontributed to the improvement or operation of the nonmarital\nproperty, or if the spouse who did not receive the nonmari-\ntal property nevertheless significantly cared for it during the\nmarriage. We do not apply the Van Newkirk exception unless\nthe contributions were significant and we have evidence of\ntheir value.61\n   Here, the court found that the Van Newkirk exception did\nnot apply because Shelley “failed to introduce evidence of\nthe value of her contribution toward the improvements or\noperation of [Brozek & Sons].” Plus, the court said that the\n\n58\t\n      See Bauerle v.

Instead, she argues that\nunder Grace v. Grace, the court should have given her a cash\naward for the inadequacy of the marital estate.62 In Grace, the\nhusband had a minority stake in a closely held family ranching\ncorporation with assets of $6.8 to $9.1 million. The corpora-\ntion employed the husband, paying him $1,500 per month and\nproviding him food, lodging, utilities, a truck, and fuel. He\nreceived all of his shares by gift or inheritance.\n   We concluded that the Van Newkirk exception did not apply\nbecause the wife had not cared for or contributed to the\nimprovement of the corporation. But we said that Van Newkirk\nwas not “an ironclad, rigid rule for all circumstances.”63 We\nemphasized that the division of property depends on the facts\nand equities of each case. In Grace, “the fact remain[ed]\nthat due to the way the parties to this marriage lived dur-\ning the marriage, they did not acquire a house or a car or\nany property a married couple of 16 years, with above aver-\nage assets, would be expected to acquire.”64 So we ordered\nthe husband to pay the wife $100,000 as part of the division\nof property.\n   We have since referred to the award in Grace as “compen-\nsation for the inadequacy of the marital estate.”65 The Court\nof Appeals has affirmed the denial of a Grace award in cases\nwith marital estates between $500,000 and $600,000.66 It has\n\n62\t\n      Grace v.

The parties’ net\nmarital estate is about $2.5 million. Shelley might wish that\nthe marital estate were larger, but it is not inadequate. Because\nKirk personally farmed some land in addition to his work for\nBrozek & Sons, he and Shelley acquired substantial assets,\nsuch as machinery and crops in storage. If Kirk’s efforts during\nthe marriage enhanced the value of Brozek & Sons and Brozek\nFarms, the increased value was reflected in the price that Kirk\npaid for Shelley’s shares in both corporations.\n\n                 (c) No Attorney Fees in Decree\n   [22,23] Shelley argues that the court should have awarded\nher about $200,000 for the attorney fees she incurred in pros-\necuting the divorce. A uniform course of procedure exists in\nNebraska for the award of attorney fees in dissolution cases.68\nA dissolution court should consider the nature of the case, the\namount involved in the controversy, the services actually per-\nformed, the results obtained, the length of time required for\npreparation and presentation of the case, the novelty and diffi-\nculty of the questions raised, and the customary charges of the\nbar for similar services.69\n   After reviewing the relevant factors, we conclude that the\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by declining to award Shelley\nattorney fees in the decree. We note that Shelley stated the\nsums of attorney fees she had incurred from various law\nfirms, but she did not submit an affidavit or other evidence\nthat showed the work performed by her lawyers.

CONCLUSION\n   We conclude that the corporate buy-sell agreement in this\ncase does not, by its terms, apply to transfers between spouses.\nBecause the court ordered one spouse to buy the other spouse’s\nshares, it was not bound by the value determined under the\nagreement. As to the remaining issues raised by Kirk, we do\nnot believe that the court’s division of the marital estate or\nits refusal to award Kirk a credit for the value of long-gone\npremarital property was an abuse of discretion. And the court\nhad statutory jurisdiction to award Shelley attorney fees for the\nprospective appellate work of her lawyer after Kirk appealed\nfrom the decree. Nor do we find any merit to the errors that\nShelley assigns in her cross-appeal.

In a marital dissolution action, an appellate\n                     court reviews the case de novo on the record to determine whether there\n                     has been an abuse of discretion by the trial judge.\n                2.\t Judges: Words and Phrases. A judicial abuse of discretion exists if the\n                     reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriv-\n                     ing a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in matters\n                     submitted for disposition.\n                3.\t Contracts: Statutes: Appeal and Error. The construction of a contract\n                     and the meaning of a statute are questions of law which an appellate\n                     court reviews de novo.\n                4.\t Contracts: Stock. The general rules of contract construction apply to\n                     restrictive share agreements.\n                5.\t Contracts. If a contract’s terms are clear, a court may not resort to the\n                     rules of construction and must give the terms their plain and ordinary\n                     meaning as a reasonable person would understand them.\n                 6.\t ____. A court must consider a contract as a whole and, if possible, give\n                     effect to every part of the contract.\n                7.\t Divorce: Property Division. In a divorce action, the purpose of a\n                     property division is to distribute the marital assets equitably between\n                     the parties.\n                8.\t Property Division. Equitable property division is a three-step process.\n                     The first step is to classify the parties’ property as marital or nonmarital.\n                     The second step is to value the marital assets and marital liabilities of\n                     the parties. The third step is to calculate and divide the net marital estate\n                     between the parties.\n                 9.\t ____. The ultimate test in determining the appropriateness of a property\n                     division is fairness and reasonableness as determined by the facts of\n                     each case.\n\f                                     - 682 -\n                        Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                         292 Nebraska R eports\n                             BROZEK v.

SUMMARY\n   Shelley Jane Brozek and Kirk Steven Brozek separated,\nand the court later dissolved their marriage of about 20 years.\nThe decree divided the marital estate and ordered Kirk to\nbuy some of Shelley’s separate property. Kirk appeals, and\nShelley cross-appeals. Kirk argues that the court erred by\nordering him to buy Shelley’s shares in a closely held farming\ncorporation for an amount higher than the value determined\nunder a stock redemption agreement. He also argues that the\ncourt erred in dividing the marital estate, that it should have\ngiven him a credit for premarital property he disposed of\nduring the marriage, and that it lacked jurisdiction to award\nShelley attorney fees after he filed a notice of appeal. Shelley\nargues that the court should have awarded her alimony, a cash\naward for the inadequacy of the marital estate, and attorney\nfees. We affirm the decree and the order awarding Shelley\nattorney fees.\n\f                             - 684 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                       BROZEK v.

BACKGROUND\n                   1. Parties’ Work History\n   Shelley and Kirk married in October 1993. They have two\ndaughters, and Kirk adopted Shelley’s son from a prior mar-\nriage. The parties separated on December 24, 2011, after more\nthan 18 years together.\n   A month later, Shelley filed a dissolution complaint. When\nthe court tried the case in April 2014, Shelley was 50 and\nKirk was 47 years of age. Only one of their children was still\na minor.\n   Kirk has farmed since he graduated from college in 1986.\nHe farms with his father, brother, and adopted son.\n   Before Shelley married Kirk, she worked as a grocery clerk\nand secretary, and she also worked in sales. She did not pursue\neducation beyond high school and testified that her marriage to\nKirk did not interrupt her education or career.\n   Shelley stated she and Kirk were in “total agreement” that\nshe would not work outside the home. She maintained the\nmarital home, brought meals and equipment parts to the field,\nmowed and sprayed pasture, and helped put up hay on a few\nsmall tracts. Kirk’s brother, though, testified that Shelley sel-\ndom helped with the farming operation and “was mostly in\nthe way.”\n                      2. The Corporations\n   Kirk’s farming is interwoven with two closely held corpora-\ntions. The first, Brozek & Sons, Inc., is “the operating entity\nof the farming operation.” It owns the land, sells the grain, and\npays the Brozeks and others for their services. Its largest asset\nis about 3,400 acres of land. Kirk and his brother personally\nrent some of Brozek & Sons’ land, but the corporation “also\noperate[s] some of its own ground.”\n   The other corporation is Brozek Farms, Inc., which is “prin-\ncipally an equipment company.” It leases the equipment it\nowns to Brozek & Sons.\n   Kirk and Shelley are shareholders of both Brozek & Sons\nand Brozek Farms. Kirk’s parents gifted him shares of Brozek\n\f                              - 685 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                        BROZEK v.

Shelley testified that\nshe received her shares by gift during the marriage. Kirk has\n75,541.67 shares, and Shelley has 12,000 shares of Brozek &\nSons, comprising stakes of about 21 percent and 3 percent,\nrespectively. Kirk has 437.5 shares, and Shelley has 62.5\nshares of Brozek Farms.\n   Kirk, Shelley, and the other shareholders of Brozek & Sons\nsigned a “Redemption Agreement” in 2003. The agreement\nstates that no sale, assignment, or other disposition of Brozek\n& Sons shares is valid unless made under the agreement.\n   At trial, the parties disputed the meaning of two paragraphs\nof the agreement. The second paragraph provides:\n      Transfer to Related Stockholder. Anything in this agree-\n      ment to the contrary notwithstanding, a Stockholder may\n      at any time or from time to time transfer all or any part\n      of his stock to his spouse, one or more of his children, or\n      a trustee or custodian for the exclusive benefit of himself,\n      his spouse, or his issue . . . .\nThe third paragraph provides: “Sale During Life. A Stockholder\ndesiring, during his lifetime, to sell or otherwise encumber his\nstock shall make a written offer to sell to [Brozek & Sons]\nupon the following terms and conditions, and [Brozek & Sons]\nshall purchase all of such shares of stock . . . .” The original\nprice was $8.50 per share, but Kirk testified that the Brozek &\nSons board increased it to $12 in 2013.\n   Shelley testified that she did not want to remain a share-\nholder of either Brozek & Sons or Brozek Farms because\n“I don’t think that would be reasonable.” Kirk testified that\nhe did not want to purchase Shelley’s Brozek & Sons shares\nfor a price above the value determined under the redemp-\ntion agreement.\n   In contrast to Brozek & Sons, there is no redemption agree-\nment for Brozek Farms. Kirk testified that he was willing to\nbuy Shelley’s Brozek Farms shares at a price determined by\nthe court.\n   Kirk and Shelley hired experts to appraise their Brozek &\nSons and Brozek Farms shares using a net asset approach.\n\f                              - 686 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                        BROZEK v.

He valued a minority\nshare of Brozek Farms at $341 in August 2011 and $290 in\nAugust 2012. As of December 24, 2011, Kirk’s expert valued\nShelley’s Brozek & Sons shares at about $34 each and her\nBrozek Farms shares at about $270 each. Shelley’s expert\nreviewed the reports of Kirk’s expert and testified that the main\ndifferences were the valuation dates and the discounts for lack\nof control and marketability.\n\n                 3. Disputed Personal Property\n   Because Brozek & Sons held the land, Kirk and Shelley\ndid not own any real estate. But they did accumulate signifi-\ncant personal property during the marriage, including several\nhorses. Shelley could not remember how many horses she and\nKirk had when they separated, but she thought there might\nhave been six. She did not possess any of the horses at the time\nof trial because her current residence lacked facilities.\n   In Kirk’s “Statement of Financial Condition” as of December\n31, 2011, he said that he had “Horses 7 head” but named only\nsix animals. In a “2011 Depreciation and Amortization Report,”\nKirk included a “Horse/MH” in addition to the six horses he\nnamed in his “Statement of Financial Condition.” Kirk had\ntaken depreciation on all of the horses except one.\n   Kirk valued the horses at $12,600. Shelley suggested that\nthe court include half of the horses’ value in the marital estate\nand award the horses to Kirk.\n   The parties acquired a horse trailer during their marriage.\nShelley possessed the trailer at the time of trial but did not\nwant it because she did not have any horses. Kirk stated that\nhe did not want the trailer.\n   Shelley and Kirk also bought automobiles during their mar-\nriage, including a 2004 Ford pickup truck. Kirk was driving\nthe truck when he and Shelley separated but said that their\nadult daughter was driving it at the time of trial. Shelley testi-\nfied that their adult daughter drove, but did not own, the truck,\n\f                              - 687 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                        BROZEK v.

K irk’s Premarital Property\n   Kirk attempted to identify and trace a significant amount of\npremarital personal property. For items that he no longer had at\nhis separation from Shelley, Kirk asked for a “credit or set-off”\nagainst the marital estate.\n   Kirk’s alleged premarital property included two checking\naccounts. He used one for household use and the other for\nfarm use. Kirk said that the farm account had about $79,000\nwhen he married Shelley. He added Shelley’s name to both\naccounts after their marriage, and they used the accounts until\nthey separated.\n   For the premarital machinery that he had sold or traded in,\nKirk wanted a credit against the marital estate. He submitted\nevidence of the purchase price of the machinery, which he said\nwas evidence of its “value” because his equipment held its\nvalue as it aged or even appreciated. But he acknowledged that\nfarm equipment generally depreciates.\n   The premarital machinery that Kirk no longer possessed\nincluded two tractors, a disk, a cultivator, a fertilizer spreader,\nand a drill. Kirk testified that he sold or traded in each of these\nitems at some point but could not remember what consideration\nhe received. He remembered using the trade-in value of a pre-\nmarital shredder and an unspecified amount of “cash boot” to\nacquire a different shredder in 2011. Asked what the trade-in\nvalue for the shredder was, Kirk took “a guess that my memory\nis $3,500.” He said he kept “unique files for each unique item\nof equipment,” but files matching that description are not in\nthe record.\n   Finally, Kirk wanted a “bushel for bushel set-off,” or at least\na credit, for the crops he harvested in 1993. He said he farmed\na particular number of acres of corn, popcorn, and soybeans in\n1993. Using an “average [yield] of the area of the other fields\nin the area,” he estimated how many bushels he harvested, and\n\f                             - 688 -\n                   Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                    292 Nebraska R eports\n                       BROZEK v.

Kirk used the proceeds of his 1993\nharvest to “reinvest[] my cash fund, and inventory of grain to\nfund the next years crop” and “rolled such investments, year to\nyear, from 1993 through December 24, 2011.”\n                  5. Parties’ Income and Their\n                 Postseparation Circumstances\n   Most of Shelley and Kirk’s income came from Kirk’s per-\nsonal farming activities and the salaries he drew from Brozek\n& Sons and Brozek Farms. According to Kirk’s W-2 wage\nand tax statements, he received combined wages from Brozek\n& Sons and Brozek Farms of $31,800 in 2008, $33,600 in\n2009, and $33,600 in 2010. Brozek & Sons also paid the\nfamily’s health insurance premiums, telephone bills, Internet\nbills, and fuel costs. Brozek & Sons also let Kirk and Shelley\nlive rent free in a house owned by the corporation. Kirk said\nhis annual net farm income with straight-line depreciation\nwas about $35,600 in 2008; $124,000 in 2009; and $77,400\nin 2010.\n   After their separation, Kirk continued to farm and Shelley’s\npursuits varied. She found employment with a large hog pro-\nducer caring for “reject pigs” that had “something wrong with\nthem.” Once the pigs put on weight, Shelley and the producer\nsold them and split any profits.\n   Shelley also sold a few steers from her cattle herd. She took\nabout 24 cows and 17 calves with her when she left the marital\nhome in December 2011. Shelley had maintained the herd but\ncould not grow it because of financial constraints. Her hope\nwas to support herself by growing the herd, but she needed\nmore pasture.\n   Outside of her livestock operation, Shelley has done some\n“odd jobs” for friends. She thought that the only other jobs\navailable to her in the area were those paying around minimum\nwage. She estimated that her living expenses were $5,160\nper month.\n   According to her separately filed federal tax returns, Shelley\nhad a total income of about $17,200 in 2012 and $17,600 in\n\f                             - 689 -\n                  Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                   292 Nebraska R eports\n                       BROZEK v.

According to Kirk’s federal tax return, he lost $13,000\nin 2012.\n                           6. Decree\n   In September 2014, the court entered its operative decree\ndissolving the parties’ marriage. It determined that Kirk and\nShelley’s Brozek & Sons and Brozek Farms shares were\ntheir separate property. But Kirk should nevertheless buy\nShelley’s shares in both corporations because leaving them in\nShelley’s hands “would be impractical and lead to an inequi-\ntable result.”\n   The court valued Shelley’s Brozek & Sons shares at $50\neach and her Brozek Farms shares at $315.50 each. It stated\nthat the appraisals of Shelley’s expert reflected the “current\nmarket value closest to the date of trial” and were more persua-\nsive than the opinions of Kirk’s expert.\n   The court ordered Kirk to pay Shelley $600,000 for her\n12,000 shares of Brozek & Sons and $19,718.75 for her 62.5\nshares of Brozek Farms. And, on the issue that has largely\ndriven this appeal, it found that the redemption agreement\ndid not apply to Kirk’s purchase of the Brozek & Sons shares\nbecause the agreement, by its terms, did not apply to transfers\nbetween spouses.\n   The court rejected Kirk’s attempts to trace his premarital\nproperty. Regarding the checking accounts, it stated that the\nfunds “have been so commingled that it is not practicable to\nattempt to separate them to any logical end.” Similarly, giving\nKirk a credit for the value of the premarital machinery that he\ntraded in during the marriage would require speculation. Nor\nwas Kirk entitled to a “grain-for-grain credit” for his 1993\nharvest. He only estimated the number of bushels he actually\nharvested. Plus, the court was not persuaded that “after nearly\n20 years of marriage the [market] value of the grain was not\ncompletely commingled in the years that farming operations\nwere not as profitable as when they were more so.”\n   The court valued the parties’ net marital estate at about\n$2.5 million, nearly $2.4 million of which it awarded to Kirk.\n\f                                    - 690 -\n                        Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                         292 Nebraska R eports\n                             BROZEK v.

The court determined that funds in both the household\nand farm checking accounts on December 23 and 24, 2011,\nwere marital property. It awarded Kirk the 2004 Ford pickup,\nthe horse trailer, and “7 head of horses valued at $6,300.” It\nawarded Shelley 36 head of cattle valued at about $40,000.\nTo equalize the marital estate, the court ordered Kirk to pay\nShelley about $1.1 million.\n   Shelley argued that she should receive additional compensa-\ntion because the corporate ownership of farming assets made\nthe marital estate inadequate. The court referred to Shelley’s\nrequest as one for a “Grace award” under our decision in Grace\nv. Grace.1 The court declined Shelley’s invitation, emphasizing\nthat the marital estate was substantial and that Kirk’s average\nincome from 2009 to 2011 was $96,000. Furthermore, Shelley\nwould be compensated for the effort she and Kirk put into\nthe Brozek family corporations through the forced sale of her\nshares to Kirk for about $620,000.\n   The court similarly denied Shelley’s request for $3,000\nper month of alimony for 10 years. It acknowledged “a great\ndisparity in incomes of the parties.” But it concluded that\nthe marriage had not interrupted Shelley’s career or educa-\ntional pursuits and that she would not have to delay any such\npursuits to care for the children, the youngest of which was\nnearly the age of majority. Plus, the court noted that Shelley\nwould receive cash for her shares in the Brozek corporations\nand a large equalization payment: “This will, as a natural\nconsequence, reduce [Kirk’s] earning capacity and likewise\nincrease [Shelley’s] earning capacity due to access to over\n$1,887,984.00 in cash or assets for investment in her cattle\nherd or otherwise.”\n   The court ordered each party to pay their own attorney fees\nand costs.\n\n 1\t\n      Grace v.

ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Kirk assigns, restated, that the court erred by (1) ordering\nhim to buy Shelley’s Brozek & Sons shares at a price contrary\nto the redemption agreement; (2) not valuing Shelley’s Brozek\n& Sons and Brozek Farms shares as of the date of the parties’\nseparation; (3) awarding him the horse trailer, the 2004 Ford\npickup, and the horses; (4) not giving him a credit against the\nmarital estate for the value of his premarital checking accounts,\nmachinery, and crops; and (5) awarding Shelley attorney fees\nafter he appealed from the decree.\n   On cross-appeal, Shelley assigns that the court erred by not\nawarding her (1) alimony, (2) a Grace award, and (3) attorney\nfees in the decree.\n\n                  IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] In a marital dissolution action, an appellate court\nreviews the case de novo on the record to determine whether\nthere has been an abuse of discretion by the trial judge.2 A\njudicial abuse of discretion exists if the reasons or rulings of a\ntrial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriving a litigant of\na substantial right and denying just results in matters submitted\nfor disposition.3\n\n 2\t\n      See Coufal v.

ANALYSIS\n                        1. K irk’s A ppeals\n                   (a) Redemption Agreement\n   Kirk argues that the redemption agreement should control\nthe price he pays for Shelley’s Brozek & Sons shares. The\nthird paragraph of the agreement provides that shareholders\nwho wish to sell their shares must offer them to the corpora-\ntion at a price determined under the agreement. At the time\nof trial, that price was $12 per share. But the court decided\nthat the repurchase provision in the third paragraph did not\napply, because a sale between Kirk and Shelley was a trans-\nfer to a related stockholder under the second paragraph of\nthe agreement.\n   Stock transfer restrictions, such as redemption agreements,\nare generally enforceable under Nebraska law.5 A transfer of\nshares contrary to a restrictive agreement is voidable in equity.6\nBut we have not yet considered redemption agreements in a\nmarital dissolution action.\n   When dividing marital property, most courts do not treat\na redemption agreement as conclusive evidence of a share’s\nvalue.7 Instead, a majority consider the price in the agreement\n\n 4\t\n      See, Cain v.

And he\nargues that the court should not have awarded him the entire\nvalue of the 2004 Ford pickup truck because their adult daugh-\nter drove the truck.\n   [7-9] In a divorce action, the purpose of a property divi-\nsion is to distribute the marital assets equitably between the\nparties.20 Equitable property division is a three-step process.21\nThe first step is to classify the parties’ property as marital or\nnonmarital.22 The second step is to value the marital assets and\nmarital liabilities of the parties.23 The third step is to calculate\nand divide the net marital estate between the parties.24 The\nultimate test in determining the appropriateness of a property\ndivision is fairness and reasonableness as determined by the\nfacts of each case.25\n   We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by\ndistributing the horse trailer, horses, and pickup truck to Kirk.\nThe court had a good reason for not awarding the horse trailer\nto Shelley: she did not have any horses. Contrary to Kirk’s\nargument, Shelley did not ask the court to award her the horse\ntrailer. She testified that she did not have much use for a horse\ntrailer but that “[i]f the Court feels that I need that trailer, then\nso be it.”\n   The court did not err by awarding the horses to Kirk,\nbecause Shelley lacked the facilities to keep them.

Kirk\nargues that the decree, which included “7 head of horses” in the\nmarital estate, “awards more horses than exist.”26 Asked how\nmany horses she and Kirk had when they separated, Shelley\ntestified, “Six, maybe, or something. I don’t know.” But Kirk\nsaid in his December 2011 “Statement of Financial Condition”\nthat he had “Horses 7 head,” and his “2011 Depreciation and\nAmortization Report” seems to list seven different horses. So\nthe record supports the court’s finding that the parties had\nseven horses.\n    Finally, the court did not abuse its discretion by including\nthe 2004 Ford pickup truck in the marital estate and awarding\nit to Kirk. Kirk does not dispute that he and Shelley bought the\ntruck during the marriage with marital funds. And he testified\nthat he was driving the truck when he and Shelley separated.\nEven if the parties were allowing their adult daughter to drive\nthe truck at the time of trial, she was not the owner. So this fact\ndid not oblige the court to “neutralize[]” the truck for equitable\ndistribution purposes.27\n\n                       (c) Valuation Date\n   Kirk argues that the court should have used the separation\ndate instead of the trial date to value “the assets.”28 He states\nthat he and Shelley “stayed away from one another” after\nDecember 24, 2011, and suggests that “[t]he assets are not\nmore related to the trial date than the separation date.”29\n   [10] Generally, the date on which a court values the marital\nestate should be rationally related to the property composing\nthe marital estate.30 But as Shelley notes, the court actually\nvalued much of the marital property on the separation date.

The values that\nthe court used for automobiles, trailers, cattle, snowmobiles,\nand other personal property match those in Shelley’s “Marital\nBalance Sheet” and Kirk’s “Statement of Financial Condition,”\nwhich are dated December 24 and 31, 2011. An exception is\nthe parties’ farm equipment, for which the court accepted the\nvalues from an appraisal dated December 12, 2012. But Kirk\nput that appraisal in evidence, so he can hardly complain about\nthe court’s using it.\n   Kirk’s main complaint is that the court should have used\nhis appraisal of Shelley’s corporate shares, which valued them\non the date of separation. The court found Shelley’s apprais-\nals more persuasive, in part, because they were “reflective of\nthe current market value closest to date of trial.” The shares\nwere Shelley’s nonmarital property, and we are not aware of\nany authority requiring a court to value nonmarital corporate\nshares as of the date when the acrimony between two share-\nholders reached a boiling point. Shelley’s expert testified\nthat appraisers generally prefer the most recent information\nbecause the value of a corporation’s assets can fluctuate.\nKirk counters that a “price-spike” occurred between the\ndates of separation and trial which, in hindsight, proved to\nbe “a short-term artificial run-up in land values.”31 Even if\nKirk is correct, the court had no way of knowing what the\nfuture held.\n\n                (d) Tracing of Premarital Assets\n   Kirk argues that the court should have given him a credit\nagainst the marital estate for the value of some of his pre-\nmarital property.

And, for the retirement accounts, the court awarded\nKirk a portion of their value that is substantially higher than\nthe value that Kirk claims in his brief. He specifically argues\nthat the court should have given him a credit for the value of\n(1) the premarital portion of the farm checking account, (2)\nthe crops from his 1993 harvest, and (3) the machinery he\nowned at the time of his marriage. We restrict our review to\nthose issues.33\n   [11-14] Generally, all property accumulated and acquired by\neither spouse during a marriage is part of the marital estate.34\nExceptions include property that a spouse acquired before the\nmarriage, or by gift or inheritance.35 Setting aside nonmarital\nproperty is simple if the spouse possesses the original asset,\nbut can be problematic if the original asset no longer exists.36\nSeparate property becomes marital property by commingling\nif it is inextricably mixed with marital property or with the\nseparate property of the other spouse.37 If the separate property\nremains segregated or is traceable into its product, commin-\ngling does not occur.38 The burden of proof rests with the party\nclaiming that property is nonmarital.39\n   After reviewing the record, we conclude that Kirk did not\ntrace the value of the premarital funds in the farm checking\naccount, the crops from his 1993 harvest, or the premari-\ntal machinery.

And, after reviewing the evidence, we cannot follow\nthe threads in the hodgepodge of figures.\n   For the farm checking account, Kirk presented evidence of\nits value before the marriage and its value on the separation\ndate. Between those two points, Shelley became an account\nholder and Kirk made an unknown number of deposits and\nwithdrawals. Kirk did not present any evidence of the with-\ndrawal amounts during the marriage. Without any evidence\nof what withdrawals the parties made during the marriage,\n“the overwhelming likelihood is that tracing of withdrawals is\nnot possible.”41\n   Similarly, Kirk did not show what form his 1993 crops had\ntaken by the time he and Shelley separated. He said that he\n“rolled” the proceeds of his 1993 harvest into the next years’\ncrop, a process which he repeated each year through 2011.\nThe proceeds of the 1993 harvest were therefore mixed with\nthe proceeds of marital harvests and subject to the vicissitudes\nof the farming economy for nearly 20 years. Besides, Kirk\ncould not show the number of bushels he actually harvested in\n1993. He instead relied on an estimate using average yields for\nthe area.\n   For his premarital machinery, Kirk argues that we should\nrequire less specificity because “tracing the value of continu-\nously traded-in equipment would be futile.”42 He analogizes\nhis farm machinery to the cattle herd which the Nebraska\nCourt of Appeals treated as a single asset in Shafer v.

The husband testified\nthat he continuously replaced the livestock as he sold them\nand that the herd gradually grew throughout the marriage,\nexcept for a brief period of drought. The husband sought a\n“set-aside” against the marital estate for the value of his pre-\nmarital cattle.44\n   The Court of Appeals “view[ed] the cattle herd as in effect\na single asset—rather than taking a ‘cow by cow’ approach.”45\nThe husband had sold his premarital cows, but the herd itself\npersisted through the roughly 13-year marriage:\n      while an individual cow which [the husband] owned in\n      1991 was long ago turned into hamburger, hot dogs, and\n      shoe leather and thus is not traceable, the cattle herd\n      itself, which has always been part of [the husband’s]\n      farming operation, is in fact traceable. To do otherwise\n      seems to us to exalt form over substance and ignore the\n      equitable nature of a dissolution action.46\nThe Court of Appeals decided that the trial court should have\ngiven the husband a $60,000 credit against the marital estate\nfor the premarital portion of the herd.\n   We conclude that Kirk’s premarital machinery is distin-\nguishable from the cattle herd in Shafer. A cow-and-calf herd\nis often a self-sustaining body: it produces calves each year,\nabout half of which are heifers that eventually have calves of\ntheir own. The same cannot be said about farm equipment. The\ncoupling of a tractor and grain cart will not produce a lawn-\nmower next spring.\n   Ideally, to trace the value of an item of premarital machin-\nery that Kirk traded in during the marriage, we would have\nevidence of the ratio of marital-to-nonmarital funds he used\nto acquire the new asset.47 With one exception, Kirk t­estified\n\n44\t\n      Id. at 177, 741 N.W.2d at 178.\n45\t\n      Id. at 178, 741 N.W.2d at 179.\n46\t\n      Id.\n47\t\n      See 1 Turner, supra note 41, § 5:61.\n\f                                     - 701 -\n                         Nebraska A dvance Sheets\n                          292 Nebraska R eports\n                              BROZEK v.

A spouse\ncan establish a “tracing link” through his own testimony,48 but\nthe court was entitled to discount Kirk’s testimony about the\nshredder because of his admitted uncertainty.\n   To summarize, as the spouse claiming a credit for nonmari-\ntal property, Kirk had the burden to show what portion of the\nparties’ machinery was attributable to his premarital assets.\nKirk did not meet his burden.

She contributed to the marriage by raising the children\nand doing the “things that a typical Nebraska farm wife does\non a day to day basis.”57 Her goal is to support herself by\ngrowing her cattle herd, and she estimated that it might take 10\nyears for her to do so. She suggests that alimony of $3,000 per\nmonth for 10 years would be reasonable.\n   [21] We conclude that the court did not abuse its discre-\ntion by declining to award Shelley alimony.

Shelley notes that the division\nof the marital estate and the award of alimony are separate\ninquiries under § 42-365. But that does not mean that a party’s\nresources are irrelevant to her need for alimony. In weigh-\ning a request for alimony, the court may take into account\nall of the property owned by the parties when entering the\ndecree, whether accumulated by their joint efforts or acquired\nby inheritance.58\n\n                       (b) “Grace Award”\n   Shelley argues that the court should have given her addi-\ntional compensation for the inadequacy of the marital estate.\nShe emphasizes that Kirk received a small salary relative to\nBrozek & Sons’ revenue and that the marital estate would have\nbeen larger if Kirk had received a higher salary. Kirk contends\nthat Shelley is not entitled to additional compensation because\nshe “departs this marriage with substantial assets.”59\n   As noted, property received by gift or inheritance is usu-\nally not part of the marital estate. But in Van Newkirk v. Van\nNewkirk,60 we recognized an exception if both spouses have\ncontributed to the improvement or operation of the nonmarital\nproperty, or if the spouse who did not receive the nonmari-\ntal property nevertheless significantly cared for it during the\nmarriage. We do not apply the Van Newkirk exception unless\nthe contributions were significant and we have evidence of\ntheir value.61\n   Here, the court found that the Van Newkirk exception did\nnot apply because Shelley “failed to introduce evidence of\nthe value of her contribution toward the improvements or\noperation of [Brozek & Sons].” Plus, the court said that the\n\n58\t\n      See Bauerle v.

Instead, she argues that\nunder Grace v. Grace, the court should have given her a cash\naward for the inadequacy of the marital estate.62 In Grace, the\nhusband had a minority stake in a closely held family ranching\ncorporation with assets of $6.8 to $9.1 million. The corpora-\ntion employed the husband, paying him $1,500 per month and\nproviding him food, lodging, utilities, a truck, and fuel. He\nreceived all of his shares by gift or inheritance.\n   We concluded that the Van Newkirk exception did not apply\nbecause the wife had not cared for or contributed to the\nimprovement of the corporation. But we said that Van Newkirk\nwas not “an ironclad, rigid rule for all circumstances.”63 We\nemphasized that the division of property depends on the facts\nand equities of each case. In Grace, “the fact remain[ed]\nthat due to the way the parties to this marriage lived dur-\ning the marriage, they did not acquire a house or a car or\nany property a married couple of 16 years, with above aver-\nage assets, would be expected to acquire.”64 So we ordered\nthe husband to pay the wife $100,000 as part of the division\nof property.\n   We have since referred to the award in Grace as “compen-\nsation for the inadequacy of the marital estate.”65 The Court\nof Appeals has affirmed the denial of a Grace award in cases\nwith marital estates between $500,000 and $600,000.66 It has\n\n62\t\n      Grace v.

The parties’ net\nmarital estate is about $2.5 million. Shelley might wish that\nthe marital estate were larger, but it is not inadequate. Because\nKirk personally farmed some land in addition to his work for\nBrozek & Sons, he and Shelley acquired substantial assets,\nsuch as machinery and crops in storage. If Kirk’s efforts during\nthe marriage enhanced the value of Brozek & Sons and Brozek\nFarms, the increased value was reflected in the price that Kirk\npaid for Shelley’s shares in both corporations.\n\n                 (c) No Attorney Fees in Decree\n   [22,23] Shelley argues that the court should have awarded\nher about $200,000 for the attorney fees she incurred in pros-\necuting the divorce. A uniform course of procedure exists in\nNebraska for the award of attorney fees in dissolution cases.68\nA dissolution court should consider the nature of the case, the\namount involved in the controversy, the services actually per-\nformed, the results obtained, the length of time required for\npreparation and presentation of the case, the novelty and diffi-\nculty of the questions raised, and the customary charges of the\nbar for similar services.69\n   After reviewing the relevant factors, we conclude that the\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by declining to award Shelley\nattorney fees in the decree. We note that Shelley stated the\nsums of attorney fees she had incurred from various law\nfirms, but she did not submit an affidavit or other evidence\nthat showed the work performed by her lawyers.

CONCLUSION\n   We conclude that the corporate buy-sell agreement in this\ncase does not, by its terms, apply to transfers between spouses.\nBecause the court ordered one spouse to buy the other spouse’s\nshares, it was not bound by the value determined under the\nagreement. As to the remaining issues raised by Kirk, we do\nnot believe that the court’s division of the marital estate or\nits refusal to award Kirk a credit for the value of long-gone\npremarital property was an abuse of discretion. And the court\nhad statutory jurisdiction to award Shelley attorney fees for the\nprospective appellate work of her lawyer after Kirk appealed\nfrom the decree. Nor do we find any merit to the errors that\nShelley assigns in her cross-appeal. We therefore affirm.\n                                                     A ffirmed.\n   Wright and McCormack, JJ., not participating.\n\n70\t\n      Garza v.
