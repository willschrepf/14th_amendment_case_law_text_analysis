Martinez, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida,\nsitting by designation.\n\f              Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 2 of 23\n\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n      This appeal requires us to decide whether a county and the healthcare\n\nprovider at its jail are liable for the death of pretrial detainee Tracy Lee Veira, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, where the record does not establish a pattern of similar incidents at\n\nthe jail, knowledge by county policymakers of the practice that the plaintiff alleges\n\nviolated the detainee’s constitutional rights, or a causal link between any custom of\n\nthe healthcare provider and the detainee’s death. Three days after Veira turned\n\nherself in at the Volusia County jail, the medical staff at the jail, furnished by\n\nCorizon Health, Inc., diagnosed her as suffering from opiate withdrawal. The\n\nmedical staff devised a treatment plan for Veira that required officers, not medical\n\npersonnel, to observe her every fifteen minutes. Officers found her dead in her cell\n\nthree-and-a-half days later. The personal representative of Veira’s estate, Ruth\n\nDenham, sued Volusia County and Corizon for violating Veira’s rights under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment by acting with deliberate indifference to Veira’s serious\n\nmedical needs, id. § 1983. Volusia County and Corizon moved for summary\n\njudgment on the ground that Denham failed to establish facts that proved that\n\neither entity had a custom or policy of deliberate indifference to Veira’s serious\n\nmedical needs. The district court granted the motions. After reviewing the record\n\nand the parties’ briefs, and hearing oral argument, we agree that Volusia County\n\nand Corizon are entitled to summary judgment. Because Denham has failed to\n\f              Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 3 of 23\n\n\nestablish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether either entity had a\n\ncustom or policy of deliberate indifference that caused Veira’s death, we affirm the\n\ndecision of the district court.\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n      The facts of this case are undeniably tragic. On September 9, 2009, Veira\n\nturned herself in at the Volusia County Jail, after she violated her probation for\n\nconvictions of driving with a canceled, suspended, or revoked license and fleeing\n\nlaw enforcement officers. Corizon was the contract healthcare provider at the jail.\n\nBefore her imprisonment, Veira was prescribed Oxycodone and Xanax by her\n\nphysician to treat symptoms of chronic back pain. These prescribed medications\n\nwere discontinued after Veira’s booking because Oxycodone and Xanax may not\n\nbe distributed to inmates.\n\n      Three days after she entered the jail, Veira went to the medical clinic and\n\nexpressed that she had been vomiting in her cell. A nurse identified signs of opiate\n\nwithdrawal and called the nurse practitioner. Without examining Veira, a doctor\n\ngave “Physician’s Orders” over the phone that prescribed various medications and\n\ninstructed that Veira be placed on a clear liquid diet for three days. The medical\n\nstaff also began a medical protocol to monitor Veira’s withdrawal symptoms and\n\nmoved Veira from the general prison population to medical segregation, where she\n\nwas placed on medical watch. Jail policy required that corrections officers observe\n\n\n                                           3\n\f                 Case: 15-12974   Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 4 of 23\n\n\nan inmate on medical watch “in time intervals not to exceed every 15 minutes and\n\ndocument[ ] as such” on a watch sheet.\n\n      In the “early afternoon” on September 14, two days after Veira was placed\n\non the medical protocol, she called her friend Crystal Wharton. She told Wharton\n\nthat she felt sicker than ever before and had submitted multiple requests for mental\n\nhealth services but that no nurse had come to see her. Veira asked Wharton to call\n\nthe medical clinic for her, which Wharton did. The medical staff saw Veira at 3:45\n\np.m. that day.\n\n      Veira went to the nurses’ station again the next day, September 15, at around\n\n2:30 p.m. According to one nurse, Nurse Jones, Veira “was slumped over lying\n\nacross 3 chairs, lethargic, diaphoretic, with pale skin, arms and legs twitching,\n\n[and] exhibiting slurred speech.” Jones was concerned. She informed the head\n\nnurse that Veira needed immediate medical attention and looked like she needed to\n\ngo to the hospital. But thirty minutes later, when Jones returned to the nurses’\n\nstation, Veira was in the same condition. The head nurse told Jones that she had\n\nnot seen Veira “and that the other [nurse] could see [Veira] when she was done\n\nwith what she was doing.” When the other nurse examined Veira, she discovered\n\nthat Veira had lost so much weight since she entered the jail that the blood pressure\n\ncuff would not fit. The other nurse later told Jones that the head nurse had said\n\nVeira was “just DT’ing, [was] already on MLD and medication,” and just needed\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                   Case: 15-12974       Date Filed: 01/13/2017           Page: 5 of 23\n\n\nwater. 1 A member of the medical staff wrote in Veira’s medical record that, at this\n\ntime, Veira was suffering from mild withdrawal.\n\n          That night, Veira “moaned and cried out loudly in pain . . . , asking for\n\nhelp,” but the guards ignored her pleas and “talk[ed] among themselves in a\n\nnegative fashion about ‘people comin’ in here on drugs.” The watch sheet for that\n\nevening and the following morning did not “show[ ] any hint of [a] problem.” But\n\nat 9:45 a.m., an officer found Veira unconscious in her cell. Veira was “in full rigor\n\nmortis and with moderate liver mortis.” Her body was covered in “a dark green\n\nbilious vomit,” and a “cup next to her head was filled to the brim with the same\n\nfluid.” According to the watch sheet for that time period, Veira had been observed\n\nevery fifteen minutes. The majority of the notations stated that Veira was observed\n\nlying on her bunk breathing, and none of them marked anything out of the\n\nordinary.\n\n          Two officers admitted that they made incorrect entries on the watch sheet in\n\nthe hour or two before Veira’s death. One of the officers stated that she wrote “on\n\nbunk breathing” on the watch sheet incorrectly for the 8:45 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.\n\nentries. The officer said that she actually saw Veira sitting on the toilet at 8:45 a.m.\n\nand standing at her cell door at 9:00 a.m. The other officer, a sergeant, wrote on the\n\nwatch sheet that she spoke with Veira at 8:33 a.m., but later stated that she did not\n\n\n1\n    The abbreviations are not defined in the record or by the parties.\n                                                    5\n\f              Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 6 of 23\n\n\nspeak with her and instead saw her on her bed, apparently sleeping. One of\n\nDenham’s medical experts disputed these statements. He stated that “purported\n\nobservations of . . . Veira by [ ] staff that she was standing at her door less than an\n\nhour before she was found unresponsive, or sitting on the toilet just over an hour\n\nbefore she was found, are preposterous” because, based on the condition of the\n\nbody when it was found, Veira had likely been dead for at least one to two hours\n\nbefore she was found at 9:54 a.m.\n\n      Additionally, the officers often recorded watches that never occurred, and\n\nthe supervisors would help the officers falsify the sheets. According to Dr. Marilyn\n\nFord, the Corrections Director for the Volusia County Division of Corrections,\n\nemployee records from 2005 through the date of Veira’s death in 2009 reveal that,\n\nexcluding the reprimands associated with Veira’s death, there were “eight other\n\ninstances where corrections officers either failed to properly maintain watch over\n\ninmates or failed to properly document their activities.” Dr. Ford explained that\n\n“[i]n every case, employees were disciplined.”\n\n      At the autopsy, the medical examiner discovered that Veira had lost at least\n\n19 pounds over the six-and-a-half days she was imprisoned. He listed “withdrawal\n\nfrom opiate abuse” as a significant condition of Veira’s cause of death. Dr. Kris\n\nSperry, one of Denham’s medical experts, stated that, in his opinion, “Veira died of\n\nthe complications of severe vomiting and dehydration which caused her to vomit,\n\n\n                                           6\n\f              Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 7 of 23\n\n\naspirate that vomit, develop aspiration pneumonia, and die.” Dr. Sperry stated that\n\nVeira likely would have survived had she been transferred to a medical facility “at\n\nleast on the evening before she was found deceased.”\n\n      An inmate was discovered dead at the jail at least one other time. A former\n\nofficer reported that he “recall[ed] one instance prior to but similar to the Veira\n\ncase in which [he] and [another officer] were the first to respond to an inmate\n\nclassified close watch and housed in the former medical clinic who had been dead\n\nso long when [they] discovered him that he [was] fully rigid and his bodily fluids\n\nwere soaking through the tissue of his back into the mattress.”\n\n      Denham, as personal representative for Veira’s estate, filed a complaint\n\nagainst Volusia County and Corizon, alleging that Volusia County and Corizon\n\nviolated Veira’s Fourteenth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate\n\nindifference to Veira’s serious medical needs, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Volusia County\n\nand Corizon filed motions for summary judgment, which the district court granted.\n\nSpecifically, the district court determined that Denham failed to produce evidence\n\nthat “Volusia County’s policymakers or the policymakers in its department of\n\ncorrections had actual or constructive knowledge of the constitutionally-violative\n\npractice” and determined that Denham failed to prove deliberate indifference under\n\na theory of liability for failure to train because she did not establish a widespread\n\npattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees or establish that\n\n\n                                           7\n\f               Case: 15-12974    Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 8 of 23\n\n\nthe need for more or different training was “obvious.” The district court also\n\ndetermined that, although a rational jury could determine that Corizon had a\n\ncustom of failing to complete intake paperwork accurately, Denham failed “to\n\nproduce affirmative evidence showing a direct causal link between this custom and\n\nVeira’s death.” And to the extent any of Denham’s arguments could be construed\n\nas an allegation of a custom of providing inadequate medical care, the district court\n\nstated that the record refuted this assertion by proving that Corizon’s staff\n\ninteracted with Veira multiple times every day. Finally, to the extent Denham\n\nalleged in her complaint that Veira’s death may have been caused by a policy or\n\ncustom of understaffing the jail, the district court determined that Denham failed to\n\nproduce any evidence of understaffing and instead relied on conclusory allusions to\n\nthat effect.\n\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       “This Court reviews de novo summary judgment rulings and draws all\n\ninferences and reviews all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\nparty.” Moton v. Cowart, 631 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir. 2001). “Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate ‘if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to\n\nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Craig\n\nv. Floyd Cty., 643 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a)). If the moving party is able to successfully meet this initial burden, the\n\n\n                                           8\n\f              Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 9 of 23\n\n\nburden then shifts to the plaintiff to provide evidence showing that a genuine issue\n\nof material fact exists for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 330 (1986).\n\nHowever, the plaintiff must do more than simply cast a metaphysical doubt\n\nregarding material facts. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475\n\nU.S. 574, 586 (1986). “A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely\n\ndisputed must support the assertion by citing to particular parts of materials in the\n\nrecord.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A).\n\n      Moreover, if the nonmoving party fails to make a sufficient showing to\n\nestablish the existence of an essential element to that party’s case, there can be no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact, since a complete failure of proof concerning\n\nan essential element of the nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other\n\nfacts immaterial. Craig, 643 F.3d. at 1309 (quoting Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at\n\n322–23).\n\n                                 III. DISCUSSION\n\n      Section 1983 “creates a private right of action to vindicate violations of\n\n‘rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws’ of the\n\nUnited States.” Rehberg v. Paulk, 132 S. Ct. 1497, 1501 (2012). Under the statute,\n\n“‘[e]very person’ who acts under color of state law to deprive another of a\n\nconstitutional right shall be answerable to that person in a suit for damages.”\n\nImbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 417 (1976). “Local governing bodies” are\n\n\n                                          9\n\f             Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 10 of 23\n\n\n“persons” for purposes of section 1983 and “can be sued directly under § 1983 for\n\nmonetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where . . . the action that is alleged to be\n\nunconstitutional implements or executes a policy . . . officially adopted and\n\npromulgated by that body’s officers.” Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of N.Y., 436\n\nU.S. 658, 690 (1978). And “although the touchstone of the § 1983 action against a\n\ngovernment body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a\n\ndeprivation of rights protected by the Constitution,” municipalities also “may be\n\nsued for constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental ‘custom’\n\neven though such a custom has not received formal approval.” Id. at 690–91. A\n\nprivate entity, like Corizon, is subject to liability under section 1983 when it\n\n“performs a function traditionally within the exclusive prerogative of the state,”\n\nsuch as contracting with the county to provide medical services to inmates because\n\nit becomes “the functional equivalent of the municipality” under section 1983\n\nwhen it performs such a function. Craig, 643 F.3d at 1310 (alterations and\n\nquotation marks omitted). To survive summary judgment, the record must contain\n\nsufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact on each of the three\n\nelements of liability under section 1983. See id. at 1309–10.\n\n      First, Denham must establish that Veira’s constitutional rights were violated.\n\nMcDowell v. Brown, 392 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir. 2004). Denham contends that\n\nVolusia County and Corizon deprived Veira of her right to due process under the\n\n\n                                           10\n\f              Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 11 of 23\n\n\nFourteenth Amendment. As a pretrial detainee, Veira’s “rights exist[ed] under the\n\ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Eighth\n\nAmendment,” but Denham’s “claims are subject to the same scrutiny as if they had\n\nbeen brought as deliberate indifference claims under the Eighth Amendment.”\n\nMann v. Taser Int’l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291, 1306 (11th Cir. 2009). To establish that\n\nVeira’s constitutional rights were violated, or in other words, to prevail on a claim\n\nof deliberate indifference to a serious medical need, Denham must show (1) a\n\nserious medical need, (2) the Defendants’ deliberate indifference to that need, and\n\n(3) causation between that indifference and Veira’s injury. Craig, 643 F.3d at\n\n1310.\n\n        Second, Denham must show “that the municipality had a custom or policy\n\nthat constituted deliberate indifference to that constitutional right.” McDowell, 392\n\nat 1289. A county is not liable under section 1983 for injuries caused solely by its\n\nemployees, McDowell, 392 F.3d at 1289, and may be held liable only when the\n\nexecution of a government policy or custom causes the injury. City of Canton v.\n\nHarris, 489 U.S. 378, 385 (1989). There are at least five ways to prove a municipal\n\npolicy or custom, Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction 511 (5th ed. 2007), but\n\nonly two are relevant to this appeal. A municipality may be liable under section\n\n1983 for violations of constitutional rights caused by a policy of failing to train its\n\nmunicipal employees, Canton, 489 U.S. at 380, and “an act performed pursuant to\n\n\n                                           11\n\f             Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 12 of 23\n\n\na ‘custom’ that has not been formally approved by an appropriate decisionmaker\n\nmay fairly subject a municipality to liability on the theory that the relevant practice\n\nis so widespread as to have the force of law.” Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v.\n\nBrown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997).\n\n      Third, Denham must establish “that the policy or custom caused the\n\nviolation.” McDowell, 392 F.3d at 1289. In sum, to survive summary judgment,\n\nDenham must produce evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute of material\n\nfact on each element of liability under section 1983: “(1) that [Veira’s]\n\nconstitutional rights were violated; (2) that the municipality had a custom or policy\n\nthat constituted deliberate indifference to that constitutional right; and (3) that the\n\npolicy or custom caused the violation.” Id.\n\n      Denham asserts five theories of liability, and each of these theories fails.\n\nFirst, she argues that Volusia County and Corizon had policies of failing to train\n\nthe guards at the Volusia County jail, but she fails to present evidence that proves\n\nthat the entities had this policy. This argument fails on the second factor. Second,\n\nshe argues that Volusia County had a custom of falsifying records to cover up the\n\nofficer’s failure to perform watches every fifteen minutes as required, but she fails\n\nto establish that any policymaker at Volusia County knew about this practice. This\n\nargument also fails on the second factor. Third, she argues that Corizon had a\n\ncustom of failing to perform the intake procedures correctly, but she does not\n\n\n                                           12\n\f                Case: 15-12974    Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 13 of 23\n\n\nexplain how this custom caused Veira’s death. This argument fails on the third\n\nfactor. Fourth, Denham argues that Corizon had a custom of providing inadequate\n\nmedical care, but, at most, she submitted evidence suggesting that Corizon\n\nprovided inadequate medical care on only a single prior occasion. This argument\n\nfails on the second factor. Fifth, Denham argues that Volusia County had a policy\n\nor custom of understaffing, but she fails to establish that a policymaker’s budget\n\ndecision was highly likely to cause Veira’s death. This argument fails on the third\n\nfactor.\n\n      A. Denham Did Not Produce Sufficient Evidence to Establish that Volusia\n\n          County and Corizon Had Policies of Failing to Train the Officers at the Jail.\n\n      Denham argues that corrections officers in the medical segregation unit at\n\nthe jail “performed critical medical duties with respect to [the] most seriously ill\n\ninmates” but were not trained to provide nonemergency medical services. She\n\nasserts that this failure to train constitutes a custom or policy of deliberate\n\nindifference. A municipality may be liable for failing to train its employees if\n\n“such inadequate training can justifiably be said to represent ‘city policy.’”\n\nCanton, 489 U.S. at 390. “Since a municipality rarely will have an express written\n\nor oral policy of inadequately training or supervising its employees, . . . a plaintiff\n\nmay prove a city policy by showing that the municipality’s failure to train\n\nevidenced a ‘deliberate indifference’ to the rights of its inhabitants.” Gold v. City\n\n\n                                            13\n\f             Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 14 of 23\n\n\nof Miami, 151 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir. 1998). The failure to train must “reflect[]\n\na ‘deliberate’ or ‘conscious’ choice by a municipality.” Canton, 489 U.S. at 389.\n\n“To establish a ‘deliberate or conscious choice’ or such ‘deliberate indifference,’ a\n\nplaintiff must present some evidence that the municipality knew of a need to train\n\nand/or supervise in a particular area and the municipality made a deliberate choice\n\nnot to take any action.” Gold, 151 F.3d at 1350.\n\n      A municipality might be on notice of a need to train or supervise in a\n\nparticular area if “the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the\n\ninadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the\n\npolicymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately\n\nindifferent to the need” or if the employees of the municipality “in exercising their\n\ndiscretion, so often violate constitutional rights that the need for further training\n\nmust have been plainly obvious to the city policymakers.” Canton, 489 U.S. at 390\n\n& n.10. Denham argues that Volusia County and Corizon failed to provide the\n\ncorrectional officers at the jail with medical training, despite using the officers to\n\nperform “critical medical duties,” and that this need to train was obvious. This\n\nargument fails.\n\n      Denham failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove that it was obvious\n\nthat the correctional officers at the Volusia County jail needed “more or different”\n\ntraining. This standard is difficult to meet. The Supreme Court has never\n\n\n                                           14\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 15 of 23\n\n\ndetermined that the need for “more or different” training was obvious. It has\n\n“given only a hypothetical example of a need to train being ‘so obvious’ without\n\nprior constitutional violations: the use of deadly force where firearms are provided\n\nto police officers.” Gold, 151 F.3d at 1352 (citing Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 n.10).\n\nThe facts in this appeal are not analogous to this hypothetical. Denham contends\n\nthat it was obvious that the officers at the jail needed medical training because\n\nVolusia County and Corizon used the officers “to perform critical medical duties.”\n\nBut the record does not establish that the officers performed “critical medical\n\nduties,” let alone medical duties. In fact, the officers were not permitted to perform\n\nthe functions of medical staff, except in emergency situations, for which the\n\nofficers were provided emergency medical training. To whatever extent the\n\nofficers needed training to deal with “split-second decisions with life-or-death\n\nconsequences[,]” like armed police contemplating the use of deadly force, Connick\n\nv. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 64 (2011), that training was provided by virtue of the\n\nemergency medical training.\n\n      Because Denham failed to identify a pattern of similar constitutional\n\nviolations, she also has not established that the Volusia County officers so often\n\nviolate constitutional rights that the need for further non-emergency medical-\n\nservices training must have been plainly obvious to the Volusia County\n\npolicymakers. See Connick, 563 U.S. at 62. She cites two incidents—the incident\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 16 of 23\n\n\ninvolving Veira and one previous incident where an officer found a dead body. But\n\neven assuming that this prior incident constitutes a “similar constitutional\n\nviolation,” we have declined to hold a supervisor liable for failure to train where\n\nthe plaintiff provided evidence of a prior, similar incident with facts similar to the\n\nplaintiff’s. Keith v. DeKalb Cty., 749 F.3d 1034, 1053 (11th Cir. 2014). We\n\ndetermined that the one prior “incident did not provide the requisite notice to [the\n\nsupervisor] that the training provided to detention officers was constitutionally\n\ndeficient.” Id. Likewise, ten complaints filed against one officer did not establish\n\nthat city officials were aware of past police misconduct because there was no\n\nevidence that the past complaints had merit. Brooks v. Scheib, 813 F.2d 1191, 1193\n\n(11th Cir. 1987). In contrast, we held a city liable where “[t]he evidence revealed\n\nseveral incidents involving the use of unreasonable and excessive force by police\n\nofficers” that established that the “city had knowledge of improper police conduct,\n\nbut failed to take proper remedial action.” Depew v. City of St. Marys, 787 F.2d\n\n1496, 1499 (11th Cir. 1986) (emphasis added). Denham has produced only two\n\nincidents. These incidents do not establish sufficient evidence for a jury to find a\n\npattern of constitutional violations supporting Denham’s theory of liability for\n\nfailure to train on non-emergency medical services.\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 17 of 23\n\n\n      B. Denham Did Not Produce Sufficient Evidence to Establish that Volusia\n\n      County or Corizon Had a Custom that Caused Veira’s Death.\n\n      Denham also argues that Volusia County and Corizon had customs that\n\nconstitute policies of deliberate indifference. “[A]n act performed pursuant to a\n\n‘custom’ that has not been formally approved by an appropriate decisionmaker\n\nmay fairly subject a municipality to liability on the theory that the relevant practice\n\nis so widespread as to have the force of law.” Brown, 520 U.S. at 404. “But it is\n\nwell established that a municipality may not be held liable under section 1983 on a\n\ntheory of respondeat superior.” Davis ex rel. Doe v. DeKalb Cty. Sch. Dist., 233\n\nF.3d 1367, 1375 (11th Cir. 2000). “Instead, ‘recovery from a municipality is\n\nlimited to acts that are, properly speaking, acts of the municipality—that is, acts\n\nwhich the municipality has officially sanctioned or ordered.’” Id. (quotation marks\n\nomitted) (quoting Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 478 (1986)). In\n\naddition to identifying “conduct properly attributable to the municipality,” Denham\n\nmust “show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite degree of\n\nculpability,” that is, “with ‘deliberate indifference’ to its known or obvious\n\nconsequences.” Id. at 1375–76 (quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at 407).\n\n      Denham argues that Volusia County had a custom of recording watches that\n\nwere not performed, but fails to produce evidence that this conduct is properly\n\nattributable to the municipality. Denham cites the affidavit of a former officer that\n\n\n                                          17\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 18 of 23\n\n\nstates that the practice of failing to perform watches and falsifying the watch sheets\n\nwas “so pervasive” that he “personally [found] it inconceivable that they were not\n\nknown to the top administrators.” But a municipality may not be held liable for the\n\nacts of its employees unless the municipality sanctioned or ordered the acts. And\n\nthe record establishes that to the knowledge of Dr. Ford, a policymaker for Volusia\n\nCounty, whenever an officer failed to perform a watch or falsified a record, the\n\nofficer was disciplined. On this record, there is no evidence that the county in any\n\nway sanctioned the behavior of the officers who violated the watch policy because\n\nto the extent the policymakers knew about this practice, the policymakers thought\n\nthe officers were punished. The record establishes that officers routinely falsified\n\nrecords and the supervisors assisted in this practice, but does not establish that any\n\npolicymaker knew about this practice and did nothing. As such, Denham has failed\n\nto establish a custom that is properly attributable to the municipality.\n\n      Denham also argues that Corizon had a custom of failing to perform intakes\n\ncorrectly and that this failure prevented Corizon from diagnosing Veira for three\n\ndays, but Denham has not established that this practice caused Veira’s death. The\n\nmedical staff diagnosed Veira as suffering from opiate withdrawal and placed her\n\non a treatment protocol three days after she entered the jail. But nothing in the\n\nrecord suggests that Veira died because of Corizon’s failure to diagnose Veira\n\nsooner. Even assuming that the failure to diagnose Veira earlier violated Veira’s\n\n\n                                          18\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017       Page: 19 of 23\n\n\nrights and satisfies the standard for a policy of deliberate indifference, Denham\n\nfailed to establish that this policy caused Veira’s death.\n\n      And to the extent Denham argues that Corizon had a custom of providing\n\ninadequate medical care, she failed to establish that Corizon provided inadequate\n\nmedical care to other inmates. Denham established that, on one other occasion, an\n\ninmate on medical watch was found dead and had been dead for a long time. But\n\nshe produces no evidence tying this death to any action of Corizon. Her claim that\n\nCorizon had a custom of providing inadequate medical care rests only on Veira’s\n\nexperiences, which are, at most, proof of “‘a single incident of unconstitutional\n\nactivity.’” Craig, 643 F.3d at 1312 (quoting Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808,\n\n823–24 (1985)). “That proof is ‘not sufficient to impose liability’ under section\n\n1983.’” Id. (quoting Tuttle, 471 U.S. at 824). Assuming that “providing inadequate\n\nmedical care” could be a custom and assuming that the medical care provided to\n\nDenham was inadequate, Denham failed to present evidence of other incidents that\n\nprove that Corizon had a custom of providing inadequate medical care.\n\n      Finally, Denham also seeks to hold Volusia County liable for Veira’s death\n\nbased on an alleged policy or custom of understaffing at the jail. She relies on the\n\ndeclarations of two former Volusia County correctional officers and a licensed\n\npractical nurse at the jail to support her assertion. These declarations, however, are\n\ninsufficient to establish Volusia County’s liability in this case. To survive\n\n\n                                          19\n\f             Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 20 of 23\n\n\nsummary judgment, Denham must produce sufficient evidence that a\n\npolicymaker’s specific budget decision was highly likely, and not simply more\n\nlikely, to inflict a particular injury. See Brown, 392 F.3d at 1292 (providing that in\n\norder to prevent municipal liability for a decision from collapsing into respondeat\n\nsuperior liability, a court must carefully test the link between the policymaker's\n\ninadequate decision and the particular injury alleged). As we stated in McDowell,\n\nto test such a link, we look to whether a complete review of the budget decision\n\nand the resulting understaffed jail reveal that the policymaker should have known\n\nthat Veira’s death was a “plainly obvious consequence” of that decision. Id. “The\n\nCounty’s liability cannot be dependent on the scant likelihood that its budget\n\ndecisions would trickle down the administrative facets and deprive a person” of her\n\nconstitutional rights. Id. While the declarations mentioned above may support\n\nDenham’s contention that the jail was understaffed, Denham has failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence that a policymaker’s specific budget decision was highly likely\n\nto cause, or the “moving force” behind, Veira’s death. Id. at 1293. Although\n\nVeira’s death was a tragic occurrence, the fact that the County’s “budget practices\n\nresulted in understaffing does not amount to a purposeful disregard which would\n\nviolate any citizen’s constitutional rights.” Id.\n\n      The standard for holding a municipality liable under section 1983 is high. A\n\nplaintiff must prove that a federal right was violated, that the municipality had a\n\n\n                                          20\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 21 of 23\n\n\npolicy of deliberate indifference, and that this policy caused the violation of the\n\nplaintiff’s federal right. Here, even assuming that the actions of Volusia County\n\nand Corizon violated Veira’s constitutional rights, Denham fails to establish the\n\nfacts necessary to survive summary judgment. She has not established that either\n\nVolusia County or Corizon had policies that caused Veira’s death. Because she has\n\nfailed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of elements essential\n\nto her case, Volusia County and Corizon are entitled to summary judgment.\n\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We AFFIRM the entry of summary judgment in favor of Corizon and\n\nVolusia County.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\f             Case: 15-12974    Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 22 of 23\n\n\nROSENBAUM, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n      I concur in the panel’s decision that the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment to both Corizon Health and Volusia County must be affirmed on the\n\nrecord in this case. I write separately, however, to note that, as to the County, in\n\nthe eight prior instances where corrections officers either failed to properly\n\nmaintain watch over inmates or failed to properly document the inmates’ activities,\n\nthe corrections officers were disciplined by only their immediate supervisors and\n\nnot by a policymaker for the County. Nor does the record in this case contain any\n\nevidence that any County policymaker was ever aware that corrections officers\n\nregularly and often with the encouragement of their immediate supervisors,\n\nfalsified inmate watch records. Had such evidence of a County policymaker’s\n\nknowledge of this practice existed, the result here would have been different\n\nbecause sufficient evidence exists to create a material issue of fact as to whether\n\nthe practice of falsifying inmate watch records was so widespread as to constitute a\n\ncustom or policy of Volusia County.\n\n      What happened here should not happen again. Counsel for Volusia County\n\nconceded during oral argument that the facts adduced in this case have since been\n\n“looked at” by County policymakers and would serve as “pretty firm evidence” of\n\nnotice in any future litigation. So I would expect that the County will immediately\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 23 of 23\n\n\ntake all necessary remedial actions to correct the systemic failures identified in this\n\ntragic and preventable case.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f",

Martinez, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida,\nsitting by designation.\n\f              Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 2 of 23\n\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n      This appeal requires us to decide whether a county and the healthcare\n\nprovider at its jail are liable for the death of pretrial detainee Tracy Lee Veira, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, where the record does not establish a pattern of similar incidents at\n\nthe jail, knowledge by county policymakers of the practice that the plaintiff alleges\n\nviolated the detainee’s constitutional rights, or a causal link between any custom of\n\nthe healthcare provider and the detainee’s death. Three days after Veira turned\n\nherself in at the Volusia County jail, the medical staff at the jail, furnished by\n\nCorizon Health, Inc., diagnosed her as suffering from opiate withdrawal. The\n\nmedical staff devised a treatment plan for Veira that required officers, not medical\n\npersonnel, to observe her every fifteen minutes. Officers found her dead in her cell\n\nthree-and-a-half days later. The personal representative of Veira’s estate, Ruth\n\nDenham, sued Volusia County and Corizon for violating Veira’s rights under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment by acting with deliberate indifference to Veira’s serious\n\nmedical needs, id. § 1983. Volusia County and Corizon moved for summary\n\njudgment on the ground that Denham failed to establish facts that proved that\n\neither entity had a custom or policy of deliberate indifference to Veira’s serious\n\nmedical needs. The district court granted the motions. After reviewing the record\n\nand the parties’ briefs, and hearing oral argument, we agree that Volusia County\n\nand Corizon are entitled to summary judgment. Because Denham has failed to\n\f              Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 3 of 23\n\n\nestablish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether either entity had a\n\ncustom or policy of deliberate indifference that caused Veira’s death, we affirm the\n\ndecision of the district court.\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n      The facts of this case are undeniably tragic. On September 9, 2009, Veira\n\nturned herself in at the Volusia County Jail, after she violated her probation for\n\nconvictions of driving with a canceled, suspended, or revoked license and fleeing\n\nlaw enforcement officers. Corizon was the contract healthcare provider at the jail.\n\nBefore her imprisonment, Veira was prescribed Oxycodone and Xanax by her\n\nphysician to treat symptoms of chronic back pain. These prescribed medications\n\nwere discontinued after Veira’s booking because Oxycodone and Xanax may not\n\nbe distributed to inmates.\n\n      Three days after she entered the jail, Veira went to the medical clinic and\n\nexpressed that she had been vomiting in her cell. A nurse identified signs of opiate\n\nwithdrawal and called the nurse practitioner. Without examining Veira, a doctor\n\ngave “Physician’s Orders” over the phone that prescribed various medications and\n\ninstructed that Veira be placed on a clear liquid diet for three days. The medical\n\nstaff also began a medical protocol to monitor Veira’s withdrawal symptoms and\n\nmoved Veira from the general prison population to medical segregation, where she\n\nwas placed on medical watch. Jail policy required that corrections officers observe\n\n\n                                           3\n\f                 Case: 15-12974   Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 4 of 23\n\n\nan inmate on medical watch “in time intervals not to exceed every 15 minutes and\n\ndocument[ ] as such” on a watch sheet.\n\n      In the “early afternoon” on September 14, two days after Veira was placed\n\non the medical protocol, she called her friend Crystal Wharton. She told Wharton\n\nthat she felt sicker than ever before and had submitted multiple requests for mental\n\nhealth services but that no nurse had come to see her. Veira asked Wharton to call\n\nthe medical clinic for her, which Wharton did. The medical staff saw Veira at 3:45\n\np.m. that day.\n\n      Veira went to the nurses’ station again the next day, September 15, at around\n\n2:30 p.m. According to one nurse, Nurse Jones, Veira “was slumped over lying\n\nacross 3 chairs, lethargic, diaphoretic, with pale skin, arms and legs twitching,\n\n[and] exhibiting slurred speech.” Jones was concerned. She informed the head\n\nnurse that Veira needed immediate medical attention and looked like she needed to\n\ngo to the hospital. But thirty minutes later, when Jones returned to the nurses’\n\nstation, Veira was in the same condition. The head nurse told Jones that she had\n\nnot seen Veira “and that the other [nurse] could see [Veira] when she was done\n\nwith what she was doing.” When the other nurse examined Veira, she discovered\n\nthat Veira had lost so much weight since she entered the jail that the blood pressure\n\ncuff would not fit. The other nurse later told Jones that the head nurse had said\n\nVeira was “just DT’ing, [was] already on MLD and medication,” and just needed\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                   Case: 15-12974       Date Filed: 01/13/2017           Page: 5 of 23\n\n\nwater. 1 A member of the medical staff wrote in Veira’s medical record that, at this\n\ntime, Veira was suffering from mild withdrawal.\n\n          That night, Veira “moaned and cried out loudly in pain . . . , asking for\n\nhelp,” but the guards ignored her pleas and “talk[ed] among themselves in a\n\nnegative fashion about ‘people comin’ in here on drugs.” The watch sheet for that\n\nevening and the following morning did not “show[ ] any hint of [a] problem.” But\n\nat 9:45 a.m., an officer found Veira unconscious in her cell. Veira was “in full rigor\n\nmortis and with moderate liver mortis.” Her body was covered in “a dark green\n\nbilious vomit,” and a “cup next to her head was filled to the brim with the same\n\nfluid.” According to the watch sheet for that time period, Veira had been observed\n\nevery fifteen minutes. The majority of the notations stated that Veira was observed\n\nlying on her bunk breathing, and none of them marked anything out of the\n\nordinary.\n\n          Two officers admitted that they made incorrect entries on the watch sheet in\n\nthe hour or two before Veira’s death. One of the officers stated that she wrote “on\n\nbunk breathing” on the watch sheet incorrectly for the 8:45 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.\n\nentries. The officer said that she actually saw Veira sitting on the toilet at 8:45 a.m.\n\nand standing at her cell door at 9:00 a.m. The other officer, a sergeant, wrote on the\n\nwatch sheet that she spoke with Veira at 8:33 a.m., but later stated that she did not\n\n\n1\n    The abbreviations are not defined in the record or by the parties.\n                                                    5\n\f              Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 6 of 23\n\n\nspeak with her and instead saw her on her bed, apparently sleeping. One of\n\nDenham’s medical experts disputed these statements. He stated that “purported\n\nobservations of . . . Veira by [ ] staff that she was standing at her door less than an\n\nhour before she was found unresponsive, or sitting on the toilet just over an hour\n\nbefore she was found, are preposterous” because, based on the condition of the\n\nbody when it was found, Veira had likely been dead for at least one to two hours\n\nbefore she was found at 9:54 a.m.\n\n      Additionally, the officers often recorded watches that never occurred, and\n\nthe supervisors would help the officers falsify the sheets. According to Dr. Marilyn\n\nFord, the Corrections Director for the Volusia County Division of Corrections,\n\nemployee records from 2005 through the date of Veira’s death in 2009 reveal that,\n\nexcluding the reprimands associated with Veira’s death, there were “eight other\n\ninstances where corrections officers either failed to properly maintain watch over\n\ninmates or failed to properly document their activities.” Dr. Ford explained that\n\n“[i]n every case, employees were disciplined.”\n\n      At the autopsy, the medical examiner discovered that Veira had lost at least\n\n19 pounds over the six-and-a-half days she was imprisoned. He listed “withdrawal\n\nfrom opiate abuse” as a significant condition of Veira’s cause of death. Dr. Kris\n\nSperry, one of Denham’s medical experts, stated that, in his opinion, “Veira died of\n\nthe complications of severe vomiting and dehydration which caused her to vomit,\n\n\n                                           6\n\f              Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 7 of 23\n\n\naspirate that vomit, develop aspiration pneumonia, and die.” Dr. Sperry stated that\n\nVeira likely would have survived had she been transferred to a medical facility “at\n\nleast on the evening before she was found deceased.”\n\n      An inmate was discovered dead at the jail at least one other time. A former\n\nofficer reported that he “recall[ed] one instance prior to but similar to the Veira\n\ncase in which [he] and [another officer] were the first to respond to an inmate\n\nclassified close watch and housed in the former medical clinic who had been dead\n\nso long when [they] discovered him that he [was] fully rigid and his bodily fluids\n\nwere soaking through the tissue of his back into the mattress.”\n\n      Denham, as personal representative for Veira’s estate, filed a complaint\n\nagainst Volusia County and Corizon, alleging that Volusia County and Corizon\n\nviolated Veira’s Fourteenth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate\n\nindifference to Veira’s serious medical needs, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Volusia County\n\nand Corizon filed motions for summary judgment, which the district court granted.\n\nSpecifically, the district court determined that Denham failed to produce evidence\n\nthat “Volusia County’s policymakers or the policymakers in its department of\n\ncorrections had actual or constructive knowledge of the constitutionally-violative\n\npractice” and determined that Denham failed to prove deliberate indifference under\n\na theory of liability for failure to train because she did not establish a widespread\n\npattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees or establish that\n\n\n                                           7\n\f               Case: 15-12974    Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 8 of 23\n\n\nthe need for more or different training was “obvious.” The district court also\n\ndetermined that, although a rational jury could determine that Corizon had a\n\ncustom of failing to complete intake paperwork accurately, Denham failed “to\n\nproduce affirmative evidence showing a direct causal link between this custom and\n\nVeira’s death.” And to the extent any of Denham’s arguments could be construed\n\nas an allegation of a custom of providing inadequate medical care, the district court\n\nstated that the record refuted this assertion by proving that Corizon’s staff\n\ninteracted with Veira multiple times every day. Finally, to the extent Denham\n\nalleged in her complaint that Veira’s death may have been caused by a policy or\n\ncustom of understaffing the jail, the district court determined that Denham failed to\n\nproduce any evidence of understaffing and instead relied on conclusory allusions to\n\nthat effect.\n\n                          II.

A\n\nprivate entity, like Corizon, is subject to liability under section 1983 when it\n\n“performs a function traditionally within the exclusive prerogative of the state,”\n\nsuch as contracting with the county to provide medical services to inmates because\n\nit becomes “the functional equivalent of the municipality” under section 1983\n\nwhen it performs such a function. Craig, 643 F.3d at 1310 (alterations and\n\nquotation marks omitted). To survive summary judgment, the record must contain\n\nsufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact on each of the three\n\nelements of liability under section 1983. See id. at 1309–10.\n\n      First, Denham must establish that Veira’s constitutional rights were violated.\n\nMcDowell v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76805\"><a href=\"/opinion/76805/roderic-r-mcdowell-v-pernell-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289 (11th Cir. 2004).

As a pretrial detainee, Veira’s “rights exist[ed] under the\n\ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Eighth\n\nAmendment,” but Denham’s “claims are subject to the same scrutiny as if they had\n\nbeen brought as deliberate indifference claims under the Eighth Amendment.”\n\nMann v. Taser Int’l, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78530\"><a href=\"/opinion/78530/mann-v-taser-intern-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1306 (11th Cir. 2009). To establish that\n\nVeira’s constitutional rights were violated, or in other words, to prevail on a claim\n\nof deliberate indifference to a serious medical need, Denham must show (1) a\n\nserious medical need, (2) the Defendants’ deliberate indifference to that need, and\n\n(3) causation between that indifference and Veira’s injury. Craig, 643 F.3d at\n\n1310.\n\n        Second, Denham must show “that the municipality had a custom or policy\n\nthat constituted deliberate indifference to that constitutional right.” McDowell, 392\n\nat 1289. A county is not liable under section 1983 for injuries caused solely by its\n\nemployees, McDowell, 392 F.3d at 1289, and may be held liable only when the\n\nexecution of a government policy or custom causes the injury. City of Canton v.\n\nHarris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112209\"><a href=\"/opinion/112209/canton-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385 (1989). There are at least five ways to prove a municipal\n\npolicy or custom, Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction 511 (5th ed. 2007), but\n\nonly two are relevant to this appeal. A municipality may be liable under section\n\n1983 for violations of constitutional rights caused by a policy of failing to train its\n\nmunicipal employees, Canton, 489 U.S. at 380, and “an act performed pursuant to\n\n\n                                           11\n\f             Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 12 of 23\n\n\na ‘custom’ that has not been formally approved by an appropriate decisionmaker\n\nmay fairly subject a municipality to liability on the theory that the relevant practice\n\nis so widespread as to have the force of law.” Bd. of Cty.

In sum, to survive summary judgment,\n\nDenham must produce evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute of material\n\nfact on each element of liability under section 1983: “(1) that [Veira’s]\n\nconstitutional rights were violated; (2) that the municipality had a custom or policy\n\nthat constituted deliberate indifference to that constitutional right; and (3) that the\n\npolicy or custom caused the violation.” Id.\n\n      Denham asserts five theories of liability, and each of these theories fails.\n\nFirst, she argues that Volusia County and Corizon had policies of failing to train\n\nthe guards at the Volusia County jail, but she fails to present evidence that proves\n\nthat the entities had this policy. This argument fails on the second factor. Second,\n\nshe argues that Volusia County had a custom of falsifying records to cover up the\n\nofficer’s failure to perform watches every fifteen minutes as required, but she fails\n\nto establish that any policymaker at Volusia County knew about this practice. This\n\nargument also fails on the second factor. Third, she argues that Corizon had a\n\ncustom of failing to perform the intake procedures correctly, but she does not\n\n\n                                           12\n\f                Case: 15-12974    Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 13 of 23\n\n\nexplain how this custom caused Veira’s death. This argument fails on the third\n\nfactor. Fourth, Denham argues that Corizon had a custom of providing inadequate\n\nmedical care, but, at most, she submitted evidence suggesting that Corizon\n\nprovided inadequate medical care on only a single prior occasion. This argument\n\nfails on the second factor. Fifth, Denham argues that Volusia County had a policy\n\nor custom of understaffing, but she fails to establish that a policymaker’s budget\n\ndecision was highly likely to cause Veira’s death. This argument fails on the third\n\nfactor.\n\n      A. Denham Did Not Produce Sufficient Evidence to Establish that Volusia\n\n          County and Corizon Had Policies of Failing to Train the Officers at the Jail.\n\n      Denham argues that corrections officers in the medical segregation unit at\n\nthe jail “performed critical medical duties with respect to [the] most seriously ill\n\ninmates” but were not trained to provide nonemergency medical services. She\n\nasserts that this failure to train constitutes a custom or policy of deliberate\n\nindifference. A municipality may be liable for failing to train its employees if\n\n“such inadequate training can justifiably be said to represent ‘city policy.’”\n\nCanton, 489 U.S. at 390. “Since a municipality rarely will have an express written\n\nor oral policy of inadequately training or supervising its employees, . . . a plaintiff\n\nmay prove a city policy by showing that the municipality’s failure to train\n\nevidenced a ‘deliberate indifference’ to the rights of its inhabitants.” Gold v. City\n\n\n                                            13\n\f             Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 14 of 23\n\n\nof Miami, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1350 (11th Cir. 1998). The failure to train must “reflect[]\n\na ‘deliberate’ or ‘conscious’ choice by a municipality.” Canton, 489 U.S. at 389.\n\n“To establish a ‘deliberate or conscious choice’ or such ‘deliberate indifference,’ a\n\nplaintiff must present some evidence that the municipality knew of a need to train\n\nand/or supervise in a particular area and the municipality made a deliberate choice\n\nnot to take any action.” Gold, 151 F.3d at 1350.\n\n      A municipality might be on notice of a need to train or supervise in a\n\nparticular area if “the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the\n\ninadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the\n\npolicymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately\n\nindifferent to the need” or if the employees of the municipality “in exercising their\n\ndiscretion, so often violate constitutional rights that the need for further training\n\nmust have been plainly obvious to the city policymakers.” Canton, 489 U.S. at 390\n\n& n.10. Denham argues that Volusia County and Corizon failed to provide the\n\ncorrectional officers at the jail with medical training, despite using the officers to\n\nperform “critical medical duties,” and that this need to train was obvious. This\n\nargument fails.\n\n      Denham failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove that it was obvious\n\nthat the correctional officers at the Volusia County jail needed “more or different”\n\ntraining. This standard is difficult to meet. The Supreme Court has never\n\n\n                                           14\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 15 of 23\n\n\ndetermined that the need for “more or different” training was obvious. It has\n\n“given only a hypothetical example of a need to train being ‘so obvious’ without\n\nprior constitutional violations: the use of deadly force where firearms are provided\n\nto police officers.” Gold, 151 F.3d at 1352 (citing Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 n.10).\n\nThe facts in this appeal are not analogous to this hypothetical. Denham contends\n\nthat it was obvious that the officers at the jail needed medical training because\n\nVolusia County and Corizon used the officers “to perform critical medical duties.”\n\nBut the record does not establish that the officers performed “critical medical\n\nduties,” let alone medical duties. In fact, the officers were not permitted to perform\n\nthe functions of medical staff, except in emergency situations, for which the\n\nofficers were provided emergency medical training. To whatever extent the\n\nofficers needed training to deal with “split-second decisions with life-or-death\n\nconsequences[,]” like armed police contemplating the use of deadly force, Connick\n\nv. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (2011), that training was provided by virtue of the\n\nemergency medical training.\n\n      Because Denham failed to identify a pattern of similar constitutional\n\nviolations, she also has not established that the Volusia County officers so often\n\nviolate constitutional rights that the need for further non-emergency medical-\n\nservices training must have been plainly obvious to the Volusia County\n\npolicymakers. See Connick, 563 U.S. at 62. She cites two incidents—the incident\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 16 of 23\n\n\ninvolving Veira and one previous incident where an officer found a dead body. But\n\neven assuming that this prior incident constitutes a “similar constitutional\n\nviolation,” we have declined to hold a supervisor liable for failure to train where\n\nthe plaintiff provided evidence of a prior, similar incident with facts similar to the\n\nplaintiff’s.

We\n\ndetermined that the one prior “incident did not provide the requisite notice to [the\n\nsupervisor] that the training provided to detention officers was constitutionally\n\ndeficient.” Id.

Denham has produced only two\n\nincidents. These incidents do not establish sufficient evidence for a jury to find a\n\npattern of constitutional violations supporting Denham’s theory of liability for\n\nfailure to train on non-emergency medical services.\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 17 of 23\n\n\n      B. Denham Did Not Produce Sufficient Evidence to Establish that Volusia\n\n      County or Corizon Had a Custom that Caused Veira’s Death.\n\n      Denham also argues that Volusia County and Corizon had customs that\n\nconstitute policies of deliberate indifference. “[A]n act performed pursuant to a\n\n‘custom’ that has not been formally approved by an appropriate decisionmaker\n\nmay fairly subject a municipality to liability on the theory that the relevant practice\n\nis so widespread as to have the force of law.” Brown, 520 U.S. at 404. “But it is\n\nwell established that a municipality may not be held liable under section 1983 on a\n\ntheory of respondeat superior.” Davis ex rel.

(quotation marks\n\nomitted) (quoting Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111615\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 478 (1986)). In\n\naddition to identifying “conduct properly attributable to the municipality,” Denham\n\nmust “show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite degree of\n\nculpability,” that is, “with ‘deliberate indifference’ to its known or obvious\n\nconsequences.” Id. at 1375–76 (quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at 407).\n\n      Denham argues that Volusia County had a custom of recording watches that\n\nwere not performed, but fails to produce evidence that this conduct is properly\n\nattributable to the municipality. Denham cites the affidavit of a former officer that\n\n\n                                          17\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 18 of 23\n\n\nstates that the practice of failing to perform watches and falsifying the watch sheets\n\nwas “so pervasive” that he “personally [found] it inconceivable that they were not\n\nknown to the top administrators.” But a municipality may not be held liable for the\n\nacts of its employees unless the municipality sanctioned or ordered the acts. And\n\nthe record establishes that to the knowledge of Dr. Ford, a policymaker for Volusia\n\nCounty, whenever an officer failed to perform a watch or falsified a record, the\n\nofficer was disciplined. On this record, there is no evidence that the county in any\n\nway sanctioned the behavior of the officers who violated the watch policy because\n\nto the extent the policymakers knew about this practice, the policymakers thought\n\nthe officers were punished. The record establishes that officers routinely falsified\n\nrecords and the supervisors assisted in this practice, but does not establish that any\n\npolicymaker knew about this practice and did nothing. As such, Denham has failed\n\nto establish a custom that is properly attributable to the municipality.\n\n      Denham also argues that Corizon had a custom of failing to perform intakes\n\ncorrectly and that this failure prevented Corizon from diagnosing Veira for three\n\ndays, but Denham has not established that this practice caused Veira’s death. The\n\nmedical staff diagnosed Veira as suffering from opiate withdrawal and placed her\n\non a treatment protocol three days after she entered the jail. But nothing in the\n\nrecord suggests that Veira died because of Corizon’s failure to diagnose Veira\n\nsooner. Even assuming that the failure to diagnose Veira earlier violated Veira’s\n\n\n                                          18\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017       Page: 19 of 23\n\n\nrights and satisfies the standard for a policy of deliberate indifference, Denham\n\nfailed to establish that this policy caused Veira’s death.\n\n      And to the extent Denham argues that Corizon had a custom of providing\n\ninadequate medical care, she failed to establish that Corizon provided inadequate\n\nmedical care to other inmates. Denham established that, on one other occasion, an\n\ninmate on medical watch was found dead and had been dead for a long time. But\n\nshe produces no evidence tying this death to any action of Corizon. Her claim that\n\nCorizon had a custom of providing inadequate medical care rests only on Veira’s\n\nexperiences, which are, at most, proof of “‘a single incident of unconstitutional\n\nactivity.’” Craig, 643 F.3d at 1312 (quoting Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111441\"><a href=\"/opinion/111441/oklahoma-city-v-tuttle/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n823–24 (1985)). “That proof is ‘not sufficient to impose liability’ under section\n\n1983.’” Id. (quoting Tuttle, 471 U.S. at 824). Assuming that “providing inadequate\n\nmedical care” could be a custom and assuming that the medical care provided to\n\nDenham was inadequate, Denham failed to present evidence of other incidents that\n\nprove that Corizon had a custom of providing inadequate medical care.\n\n      Finally, Denham also seeks to hold Volusia County liable for Veira’s death\n\nbased on an alleged policy or custom of understaffing at the jail. She relies on the\n\ndeclarations of two former Volusia County correctional officers and a licensed\n\npractical nurse at the jail to support her assertion. These declarations, however, are\n\ninsufficient to establish Volusia County’s liability in this case. To survive\n\n\n                                          19\n\f             Case: 15-12974      Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 20 of 23\n\n\nsummary judgment, Denham must produce sufficient evidence that a\n\npolicymaker’s specific budget decision was highly likely, and not simply more\n\nlikely, to inflict a particular injury. See Brown, 392 F.3d at 1292 (providing that in\n\norder to prevent municipal liability for a decision from collapsing into respondeat\n\nsuperior liability, a court must carefully test the link between the policymaker's\n\ninadequate decision and the particular injury alleged). As we stated in McDowell,\n\nto test such a link, we look to whether a complete review of the budget decision\n\nand the resulting understaffed jail reveal that the policymaker should have known\n\nthat Veira’s death was a “plainly obvious consequence” of that decision. Id. “The\n\nCounty’s liability cannot be dependent on the scant likelihood that its budget\n\ndecisions would trickle down the administrative facets and deprive a person” of her\n\nconstitutional rights. Id. While the declarations mentioned above may support\n\nDenham’s contention that the jail was understaffed, Denham has failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence that a policymaker’s specific budget decision was highly likely\n\nto cause, or the “moving force” behind, Veira’s death. Id. at 1293. Although\n\nVeira’s death was a tragic occurrence, the fact that the County’s “budget practices\n\nresulted in understaffing does not amount to a purposeful disregard which would\n\nviolate any citizen’s constitutional rights.” Id.\n\n      The standard for holding a municipality liable under section 1983 is high. A\n\nplaintiff must prove that a federal right was violated, that the municipality had a\n\n\n                                          20\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 21 of 23\n\n\npolicy of deliberate indifference, and that this policy caused the violation of the\n\nplaintiff’s federal right. Here, even assuming that the actions of Volusia County\n\nand Corizon violated Veira’s constitutional rights, Denham fails to establish the\n\nfacts necessary to survive summary judgment. She has not established that either\n\nVolusia County or Corizon had policies that caused Veira’s death. Because she has\n\nfailed to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of elements essential\n\nto her case, Volusia County and Corizon are entitled to summary judgment.\n\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We AFFIRM the entry of summary judgment in favor of Corizon and\n\nVolusia County.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\f             Case: 15-12974    Date Filed: 01/13/2017   Page: 22 of 23\n\n\nROSENBAUM, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n      I concur in the panel’s decision that the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment to both Corizon Health and Volusia County must be affirmed on the\n\nrecord in this case. I write separately, however, to note that, as to the County, in\n\nthe eight prior instances where corrections officers either failed to properly\n\nmaintain watch over inmates or failed to properly document the inmates’ activities,\n\nthe corrections officers were disciplined by only their immediate supervisors and\n\nnot by a policymaker for the County. Nor does the record in this case contain any\n\nevidence that any County policymaker was ever aware that corrections officers\n\nregularly and often with the encouragement of their immediate supervisors,\n\nfalsified inmate watch records. Had such evidence of a County policymaker’s\n\nknowledge of this practice existed, the result here would have been different\n\nbecause sufficient evidence exists to create a material issue of fact as to whether\n\nthe practice of falsifying inmate watch records was so widespread as to constitute a\n\ncustom or policy of Volusia County.\n\n      What happened here should not happen again. Counsel for Volusia County\n\nconceded during oral argument that the facts adduced in this case have since been\n\n“looked at” by County policymakers and would serve as “pretty firm evidence” of\n\nnotice in any future litigation. So I would expect that the County will immediately\n\n\n\n\n                                        22\n\f             Case: 15-12974     Date Filed: 01/13/2017    Page: 23 of 23\n\n\ntake all necessary remedial actions to correct the systemic failures identified in this\n\ntragic and preventable case.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f</pre>",
