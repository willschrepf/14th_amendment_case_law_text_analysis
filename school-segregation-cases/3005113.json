(West 2006)). NACDL requested the data used to assemble a\n\nlegislatively mandated study of eyewitness identification procedures by the Chicago Police\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nDepartment, the Joliet Police Department and two other police agencies. The Chicago and Joliet\n\nPolice Departments tendered final administrative responses to the requests, declining to produce\n\nthe majority of the data requested. NACDL filed suit against both agencies, seeking to compel\n\nproduction of the requested data. The parties in the Chicago case filed cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment. NACDL also filed a motion for summary judgment in the Joliet case. Both\n\ntrial courts directed defendants to produce some of the requested data but ruled that the majority\n\nof the information sought was either protected from disclosure by FOIA’s law enforcement and\n\nprivacy exemptions or was too burdensome for the agencies to produce. On appeal, NACDL\n\ncontends that: (1) the law enforcement and privacy exemptions of FOIA do not bar disclosure of\n\npolice data after all personal identifying information has been redacted, (2) the generic and\n\nconclusory statements in police affidavits are insufficient to satisfy the police agency’s burden of\n\nproof to show that an exemption applies, (3) the privacy exemption of FOIA does not bar the\n\ndisclosure of photographs used in lineups after all personal identifying information has been\n\nredacted, and (4) the burden of redacting identifying information does not outweigh the public\n\ninterest in obtaining the requested data. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial courts’\n\npartial grant of summary judgment in favor of NACDL, reverse the trial courts’ grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Chicago and Joliet Police Departments and remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In 2003, the Illinois General Assembly passed section 107A-10 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure of 1963 (725 ILCS 5/107A-10 (West 2006)). This legislation directed the Illinois\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nState Police to conduct a one-year pilot study in the field on the effectiveness of the sequential\n\nmethod for lineup procedures. Under the sequential method, a witness is shown lineup\n\nparticipants one at a time and must state whether the individual shown is the perpetrator of the\n\ncrime before viewing the next lineup participant. Moreover, the lineup administrator must be\n\nsomeone who does not know which participant is the suspect. 725 ILCS 5/107A-10(c)(2) (West\n\n2006). The traditional lineup procedure involves the simultaneous viewing of all lineup\n\nparticipants, and the lineup administrator usually knows which participants are suspects and which\n\nparticipants are “fillers,” i.e., persons who are not suspects themselves but bear a physical\n\nresemblance to the suspect. The statute directed the Illinois State Police to select three police\n\ndepartments to participate in the study (725 ILCS 5/107A-10(b) (West 2006)) and Chicago, Joliet\n\nand Evanston were selected. The study was conducted in 2004 and 2005.\n\n       The program director of the Illinois study released a report of the study’s findings on\n\nMarch 17, 2006. The report concluded that the Illinois data did not bear out the research\n\nexperiments that suggest that sequential, double-blind lineups produce a lower rate of known false\n\nidentifications. Instead, the study found that the sequential, double-blind procedures resulted in\n\nan overall higher rate of known false identifications than did the simultaneous lineups. The five\n\ncategories in particular for which the study concluded that the sequential, double-blind procedures\n\nmay produce a higher rate of false identifications are: (1) child witnesses, (2) older witnesses, (3)\n\ncross-racial identifications, (4) multiple perpetrators, and (5) suspects who do not match the\n\ndescription because of a change in appearance.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n        The Illinois study was one of the first to compare the two methods in the field. The\n\nresults of the study received national publicity and have been criticized by social science\n\nresearchers who have cited flaws in the study design and the failure of the report’s authors to\n\nsubmit the study for scientific peer review. NACDL sent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\n\nrequests to the Illinois State Police and the three police departments designated as participants in\n\nthe study. The FOIA requests sought the following information: (1) the procedures followed by\n\ninvestigating officers in the control group of cases which followed the traditional simultaneous\n\nlineup method, including documentation on whether each live lineup was a first viewing of a\n\nsuspect by an eyewitness or if the eyewitness had previously identified the suspect in a photo\n\nlineup, (2) the training materials and records for police personnel participating in the study, (3)\n\nrecords regarding the retention of certain personnel in connection with the study, (4) the criminal\n\ncourt case numbers for each case included in the study together with the corresponding photos\n\nand recordings of lineups and all photos shown to an eyewitness during a photo spread or\n\nsequential photo array, and (5) the complete database of information used to generate the data\n\ntables in the report.\n\n        The Chicago Police Department (CPD) denied the request, stating that it did not have\n\nsome of the requested documents and claiming that the remaining documents were exempt from\n\ndisclosure under the law enforcement exemption of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) and (d) (West\n\n2006)). The Joliet Police Department (JPD) disclosed some of the requested documents, stated\n\nthat it did not have some of the requested documents, and claimed that the remaining documents\n\nwere exempt from disclosure under the privacy and law enforcement exemptions of FOIA (5\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nILCS 140/7(1)(b), (c)(i) and (viii) (West 2006)). The Evanston Police Department also denied\n\nthe request, and the Illinois State Police produced some documents but declined to produce\n\ndocuments belonging to the various police departments. NACDL filed lawsuits in Cook and Will\n\ncounties against the four police agencies, seeking to compel production of the requested\n\ndocuments. The Evanston Police Department reached an agreement early on in the litigation with\n\nNACDL to provide the requested documents with redactions and is not a party to this appeal.\n\nThe Illinois State Police remains a party in the Chicago case, but is taking no active role in the\n\nlitigation and informed NACDL that it will comply with any applicable court order regarding the\n\ndisclosure of the documents in its possession from the designated police departments.\n\n       CPD filed a motion for summary judgment with supporting materials. CPD asserted that\n\nthe requested documents were exempt from production because their release would (1) constitute\n\nan invasion of both public and personal privacy, (2) interfere with pending law enforcement\n\nproceedings, (3) obstruct ongoing criminal investigations, and (4) disclose information specifically\n\nprohibited from disclosure under federal and state law, citing sections 7(1)(a), (b) and (c) of FOIA\n\n(5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a), (b)(v), (c)(i), (c)(vi), (c)(viii) (West 2006)). Moreover, the research\n\nrequired to determine whether each matter remained pending would constitute an undue burden\n\npursuant to section 3(f) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/3(f) (West 2006)).\n\n       In support of its motion, CPD submitted the affidavits of Officer Matthew Sandoval and\n\nLieutenant James Gibson. Sandoval stated that he had conducted a random sampling of 10 cases\n\nused in the study and his sample research indicated that of the 250 investigations involved in the\n\nstudy, approximately half of the investigations were still open. Gibson submitted two affidavits.\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nIn the first affidavit, he stated that for open investigations, releasing the requested documents\n\n“could very well interfere” with the investigations. Suspects could become aware of the status of\n\nan investigation, what the police know and what evidence they have. Disclosure could also\n\npresent a risk to the safety of witnesses and their families. In the second affidavit, Gibson stated\n\nthat for open cases, even a redacted document could still possibly be linked to an ongoing\n\ninvestigation because although the crime may have occurred in a large city, the members of the\n\nsmall community in which the crime occurred could recognize the details of a specific incident and\n\nthe safety of victims and witnesses could be compromised. Gibson further stated that if a\n\nredacted document was linked to an ongoing investigation, an at-large perpetrator could become\n\naware of what evidence the police have against him and could learn about specific police\n\ninvestigative techniques. Gibson said there is no way to adequately redact these documents\n\nbecause no single employee possesses the knowledge and discretion to determine what\n\ninformation needs to be redacted. Gibson also stated that releasing photographs of lineup\n\nparticipants “could constitute a violation of privacy.” Finally, Gibson conceded that documents in\n\nclosed cases could be released if the following information is redacted: (1) all personal identifying\n\ninformation of victims, witnesses and suspects, (2) the exact location of the incident, (3) the\n\nidentities of individual lineup participants, and (4) the exact date, internal records division (RD)\n\nnumbers, and other identifying codes.\n\n       NACDL filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, explaining that the police data was\n\nnecessary to advance an ongoing public debate about the problem of erroneous eyewitness\n\nidentifications in criminal investigations. NACDL submitted the affidavits of Rob Warden,\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nexecutive director of the Northwestern University School of Law Center on Wrongful\n\nConvictions, Norman Reimer, NACDL’s executive director, and professor Nancy Steblay, a\n\nsocial psychologist with expertise in eyewitness identification research whom NACDL retained as\n\na consultant.\n\n       Warden is a specialist in legal affairs, focusing primarily on wrongful convictions. He\n\nnoted that in 59.3% of the documented wrongful convictions in Illinois since 1900, or 54 out of\n\n91 known cases, eyewitness identification was the principal prosecution evidence. Warden stated\n\nthat erroneous eyewitness identification is by far the most prevalent factor in wrongful\n\nconvictions. Moreover, wrongful convictions entail enormous social costs, e.g., 601 years\n\ncollectively behind bars for the 54 men and women known to have been wrongfully convicted and\n\n$39 million for taxpayers in just three civil rights actions stemming from these convictions.\n\nWarden explained that the results of the study have had a profound effect on public policy in\n\nIllinois, making it unlikely that the Illinois General Assembly will act to reform police\n\nidentification procedures. Reimer provided examples of situations in which opponents of\n\nreforming lineup procedures have used the results of the study to support the use of traditional\n\nlineup procedures. Steblay stated that the results of the study contradicted decades of scientific\n\nresearch. The study has also been criticized in the scientific community for flaws in its design and\n\nmethodology and a panel of researchers declared it unreliable as a basis for determining effective\n\neyewitness identification procedures. Steblay further stated that she is acting as a consultant to\n\nNACDL without a consulting fee. Her role as a consultant is not to promote one lineup strategy\n\nover another, but to advocate for sound science particularly as it informs public policy.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n       Oral arguments were scheduled on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, and\n\nthe court recommended that the parties consider settling the case under an agreement whereby the\n\nCPD would provide NACDL with the requested, redacted police records subject to a protective\n\norder prohibiting their dissemination. The parties were unable to reach an agreement; however,\n\nduring settlement negotiations, NACDL learned that there had been a misunderstanding regarding\n\nthe scope of its FOIA request. NACDL also learned that the researchers had not had access to all\n\nof the police records concerning the investigations that were included in the study but had been\n\nfurnished with a form summarizing the outcome of the lineups and some limited documentation\n\nfrom individual investigations. CPD had interpreted the request to include only those documents\n\nto which the researchers had access (report data). This misunderstanding led to the filing of\n\nsupplemental arguments and evidence by both parties.\n\n       NACDL submitted a second affidavit of Steblay, in which she explained why a meaningful\n\ncritique of the study required access to all of the records in order to determine whether important\n\nidentification history had been excluded from the study. CPD submitted the affidavit of assistant\n\ncorporation counsel Amber Ritter, in which she estimated that redacting the full police file for\n\neach investigation included in the study would take 170 hours.\n\n       In the Joliet case, NACDL filed a motion for summary judgment that was identical to the\n\nmotion it filed in the Chicago case. JPD responded, submitting the affidavits of Officer Robert\n\nPuleo and Deputy Police Chief Patrick Kerr. Puleo estimated that it would take 197 person hours\n\nto redact the 257 police files that had been included in the study. Kerr’s affidavit was similar to\n\nthe Gibson affidavits that were submitted in the Chicago case. He stated that the disclosure of the\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nrequested documents “could very well” interfere with ongoing police investigations. He further\n\nstated that the release of the police reports would constitute an invasion of privacy of the victims\n\nand witnesses involved.\n\n       In the Chicago case, the circuit court analyzed open and closed investigations separately,\n\nand also distinguished the report data from the remaining information contained in the police\n\ninvestigation files. With respect to the open files, the court determined that these files were\n\nexempt under section 7(1)(c) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) (West 2006)), relying on Gibson’s\n\naffidavits. For the closed files, CPD agreed to produce the report data with all personal\n\nidentifying information redacted. This left three unresolved issues with respect to the closed files:\n\n(1) redaction of the faces from the photographs of lineup participants, (2) redaction of the RD\n\nnumbers, and (3) production of the remaining information in the police investigation files. The\n\ncourt found that the privacy interests of the lineup participants outweighed the interests of\n\nNACDL and the public in viewing the photographs and ruled that CPD could redact the faces in\n\nthe photographs. However, the court ruled that CPD could not redact the RD numbers because\n\nclosed files are already in the public record so the release of a number that would allow NACDL\n\nto match a police file to a specific case would not constitute an invasion of privacy. Finally, the\n\ncourt ruled that the production of information in the police investigation files that was not part of\n\nthe report data would impose a substantial burden on CPD, and that the public interest in the data\n\ndid not outweigh the burden of redacting the documents.\n\n       In the Joliet case, the circuit court held that the information in open cases was exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under sections 7(1)(b) and (c) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b)(v), (c)(iii), (c)(viii)\n\n\n                                                  9\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n(West 2006)). The circuit court granted NACDL’s motion for summary judgment in part and\n\nordered JPD to produce the report data in the closed cases with all personal identifying\n\ninformation redacted. The court held that the photographs in the closed cases were exempt from\n\ndisclosure under section 7(1)(b) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b)(v) (West 2006)). Finally, the court\n\nheld that JPD did not have to produce information from closed cases that was not part of the\n\nreport data because the redaction of identifying information contained in those materials would\n\nimpose an undue burden on the department.\n\n       NACDL filed notices of appeal in the First District in the Chicago case and in the Third\n\nDistrict in the Joliet case. NACDL then filed a motion in the Illinois Supreme Court to transfer\n\nthe Joliet case to the First District and consolidate the appeals. The Illinois Supreme Court\n\ngranted the motion on December 4, 2008. This consolidated appeal follows.\n\n\n\n                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n       Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits demonstrate\n\nthat no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law. 735 ILCS 5/2-1005(c) (West 2004); State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance\n\nCo. v. Coe, 367 Ill. App. 3d 604, 607, 855 N.E.2d 173, 176 (2006). We review de novo an order\n\ngranting summary judgment. Jones v. Country Mutual Insurance Co., 371 Ill. App. 3d 1096,\n\n1098, 864 N.E.2d 793, 795 (2007).\n\n       CPD challenges this court’s jurisdiction over the Joliet case on the grounds that a denial of\n\nsummary judgment is not a final and appealable order, citing Central Illinois Light Co. v. Home\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nInsurance Co., 342 Ill. App. 3d 940, 795 N.E.2d 412, (2003). This case is distinguishable. In\n\nCentral Illinois Light, the plaintiff filed an indemnification action against multiple excess liability\n\ninsurers. The defendants filed nine motions for summary judgment, three of which were denied.\n\nThe court concluded that it had no jurisdiction over the three denials because they were not final\n\norders. Central Illinois Light, 342 Ill. App. 3d at 964, 795 N.E.2d at 433.\n\n        “An order is final and appealable if it terminates the litigation between the parties on the\n\nmerits or disposes of the rights of the parties, either on the entire controversy or a separate part\n\nthereof.” R.W. Dunteman Co. v. C/G Enterprises, Inc., 181 Ill. 2d 153, 159, 692 N.E.2d 306,\n\n310 (1998). The only significant difference between the Chicago and Joliet cases is that the\n\nparties in the Chicago case filed cross-motions for summary judgment, while JPD merely filed a\n\nresponse to NACDL’s motion for summary judgment. Both lower courts ordered the disclosure\n\nof some of the requested documents and held that the remaining documents were protected from\n\ndisclosure under various exemptions in FOIA. The order in the Joliet case states that “all matters\n\nin controversy have been resolved.” There was nothing else for the parties to litigate in the Joliet\n\ncase. This court is not deprived of jurisdiction because the motion for summary judgment was\n\npartially denied and the court did not specifically enter judgment in favor of JPD. The denial of\n\nNACDL’s motion for summary judgment as to the majority of the requested documents operated\n\nas a judgment in favor of JPD. The court accepted JPD’s argument that the documents were\n\nexempt from disclosure and the order terminated the litigation between the parties. Indeed,\n\nappeal was the only recourse left to NACDL in its attempt to obtain the documents. Thus, we\n\nconclude that the order was final and appealable and this court has jurisdiction over the Joliet\n\n\n                                                   11\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\ncase.\n\n        We now turn to the issues on appeal. FOIA declares that it is “the public policy of the\n\nState of Illinois that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs\n\nof government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them as public officials\n\nand public employees consistent with the terms of this Act. Such access is necessary to enable the\n\npeople to fulfill their duties of discussing public issues fully and freely, making informed political\n\njudgments and monitoring government to ensure that it is being conducted in the public interest.”\n\n5 ILCS 140/1 (West 2006).\n\n        The legislature recognized that even with such a policy certain documents should not be\n\ndisclosed, and it dedicated section 7 of FOIA to exemptions. This section provides, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n                   “(1) The following shall be exempt from inspection and copying:\n\n                        ***\n\n                        (b) Information that, if disclosed, would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\n                        invasion of personal privacy***. ***Information exempted under this\n\n                        subsection (b) shall include but is not limited to:\n\n                                                         ***\n\n                                (v) information revealing the identity of persons who file complaints\n\n                                with or provide information to *** law enforcement *** agencies;\n\n                                                         ***\n\n                        (c) Records compiled by any public body for administrative enforcement\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n                    proceedings and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law\n\n                    enforcement purposes or for internal matters of a public body, but only to\n\n                    the extent that disclosure would:\n\n                            (i) interfere with pending or actually and reasonably contemplated\n\n                            law enforcement proceedings conducted by any law enforcement or\n\n                            correctional agency;\n\n                                                    ***\n\n                            (iv) unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source or\n\n                            confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;\n\n                            (v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other\n\n                            than those generally used and known ***;\n\n                            (vi) constitute an invasion of personal privacy under subsection (b)\n\n                            of this Section;\n\n                            (vii) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement\n\n                            personnel or any other person; or\n\n                            (viii) obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation.” 5 ILCS 140/7\n\n                            (West 2006).\n\n      Finally, FOIA provides:\n\n                “Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be complied with\n\n             unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for the\n\n             complying public body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden\n\n\n                                               13\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n               on the public body outweighs the public interest in the information. Before\n\n               invoking this exemption, the public body shall extend to the person making the\n\n               request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to\n\n               manageable proportions.” 5 ILCS 140/3(f) (West 2006).\n\n       Public records are presumed to be open and accessible under FOIA and the exemptions\n\nare to be read narrowly. Lieber v. Board of Trustees of Southern Illinois University, 176 Ill. 2d\n\n401, 408, 680 N.E.2d 374, 377 (1997). With that in mind, this court must address the following\n\nissues: (1) whether the circuit courts erred in determining that all data in the open investigations is\n\nprotected from disclosure under the privacy and law enforcement exemptions and, if so, whether\n\nthe undue burden exemption applies, (2) whether the circuit courts erred in determining that the\n\nfaces in the photographic lineups should be redacted, and (3) whether the circuit courts erred in\n\ndetermining that redacting the documents from the police investigation files would impose an\n\nundue burden on the police agencies.\n\n       NACDL first contends that the trial courts in both cases erred in holding that the affidavits\n\nsubmitted by CPD and JPD were sufficient to invoke the law enforcement and privacy exemptions\n\nin case files involving ongoing investigations. After the circuit courts in both cases ruled on this\n\nissue, this court issued an opinion in Day v. City of Chicago, 388 Ill. App. 3d 70, 902 N.E.2d\n\n1144 (2009). In Day, this court held that affidavits submitted by Sandoval and Gibson (that\n\nappear to be nearly identical to the affidavits submitted by these same individuals in the instant\n\ncase) were entirely conclusory and inadequate to sustain the city’s burden to show that the\n\nrequested documents were exempt. Day, 388 Ill. App. 3d at 75, 902 N.E.2d at 1149. The case\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nwas remanded and the circuit court was directed to conduct an in camera review of the\n\ndocuments in order to determine whether the law enforcement or privacy exemptions applied.\n\nDay, 388 Ill. App. 3d at 80, 902 N.E.2d at 1153.\n\n       CPD concedes that after Day, the affidavits submitted are insufficient to support its claim\n\nthat the documents are protected under the law enforcement and privacy exemptions of FOIA.\n\nHowever, because the circuit courts ruled that the production of documents outside of the report\n\ndata in the closed cases would be unduly burdensome, CPD asks this court to extend that\n\nrationale to all documents in the open investigations. If this court should conclude that\n\nproduction of the documents would not be unduly burdensome, CPD asks this court to remand\n\nfor an in camera review of the documents to determine whether the law enforcement and privacy\n\nexemptions apply. To avoid undue burden on the circuit court, CPD suggests that the circuit\n\ncourt limit its review to those files that contain some marker indicating that production of the\n\ndocuments would obstruct the investigation, e.g., cases in which there is a living perpetrator still\n\nat large. CPD further suggests that the circuit court may limit its review to a sample of the\n\ndocuments.\n\n       NACDL asks this court to reverse the circuit courts outright and order the police agencies\n\nto submit the requested data in open cases with redactions. NACDL contends that records in\n\nwhich all identifying information is redacted will not yield information that would threaten the\n\nsafety of a witness or provide information to an at-large suspect. Alternatively, NACDL asks this\n\ncourt to require that the police agencies review the requested records, perform the redactions, and\n\npresent to the court for in camera inspection any specific records for which they believe there is a\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nreasonable possibility that disclosure even with redactions could obstruct or impede law\n\nenforcement.\n\n        We agree with both parties that the affidavits submitted to the circuit courts were\n\ninsufficient to satisfy the burden of showing that any statutory exemption applies. Moreover, for\n\nthe reasons discussed below, we reject CPD’s argument that redaction of the open investigation\n\nfiles would be unduly burdensome. We do not agree that the order of the circuit court granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the police agencies should be reversed outright, but we also do not\n\nthink it is appropriate for the circuit court to conduct an in camera review of all documents in the\n\nopen investigation files to determine whether an exemption applies. In Day, the police files in\n\nquestion involved a single criminal investigation. In the instant case, there are still potentially over\n\n100 cases in which the investigations are ongoing. It is possible that there are some investigations\n\nin which production of the data could compromise an ongoing investigation, even with all\n\nidentifying information redacted. However, we do not think such a scenario is likely in the\n\nmajority of open investigations, nor will it be as easy to identify witnesses in redacted files as the\n\nGibson affidavits suggest. The fact that witnesses, victims and perpetrators may all live in the\n\nsame neighborhood and attend the same schools does not mean that the safety of a witness could\n\nbe compromised if the documents are released. Both parties agree that the location of the crime\n\nand all personal identifying information and other unique identifiers will be redacted; therefore, it\n\nwill be impossible to tell where the crime occurred and what individuals may have been involved\n\nin the majority of cases.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n       On remand, the parties should presume that all requested documents in the open\n\ninvestigations are to be produced, subject to the agreed redactions. The burden is on the police\n\nagencies to demonstrate on a case-by-case basis specifically how a particular witness could be in\n\ndanger or how an individual investigation could be compromised if a document is disclosed in\n\nwhich all identifying information has been redacted. Moreover, any affidavits submitted in\n\nsupport of a statutory exemption must conform to the level of specificity required in Day.\n\nHowever, we note that our supreme court has indicated that while summary judgment would be\n\nappropriate without in camera review if the affidavits show with reasonable specificity why the\n\ndocuments fall within the claimed exemption, in camera review is the most effective way for the\n\npublic body to objectively demonstrate that the exemption claimed does, in fact, apply. Illinois\n\nEducation Ass’n v. Illinois State Board of Education, 204 Ill. 2d 456, 470-71, 791 N.E.2d 522,\n\n531 (2003).\n\n       We reverse the orders of the circuit courts granting summary judgment in favor of the\n\npolice agencies for documents in open investigations. We remand for the police agencies to\n\nreview the files and determine which documents, if any, meet the statutory exemptions even after\n\nthe agreed redactions are made. Those documents should then be presented to the circuit court\n\nfor an in camera inspection to determine whether the exemptions do, in fact, apply.\n\n       Next, NACDL contends that the circuit courts erred in holding that the faces in the\n\nphotographic lineups are exempt from disclosure because their release would constitute an\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy. NACDL argues that once all personal identifying\n\ninformation is removed from the photographs, the persons who typically act as fillers in lineups\n\n\n                                                17\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nwill have only a minimal privacy interest in the photographs. CPD argues that there is a stigma\n\nassociated with “mug shots” and that the faces in the photographs could be recognized and\n\nidentified even if all personal identifying information is redacted.\n\n        To determine whether disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal\n\nprivacy, courts take into account (1) the plaintiff’s interest in disclosure, (2) the public interest in\n\ndisclosure, (3) the degree of invasion of personal privacy, and (4) the availability of alternative\n\nmeans of obtaining the requested information. Lieber, 176 Ill. 2d at 408-09, 680 N.E.2d at 378.\n\nNADCL’s interest and the public interest are essentially the same. As part of its analysis of the\n\nstudy, NACDL needs to assess the quality of the composition of the lineups in the study. This\n\ninformation is separate and distinct from the identification history and other information that will\n\nbe analyzed from the report data and investigation files. A meaningful analysis of the study must\n\ninclude an assessment of the lineups that were actually used. Moreover, the actual photographs\n\nare the only means available to researchers to determine the composition of the lineups that were\n\nused in the study.\n\n        On the other hand, the degree of invasion of personal privacy is insignificant. First, we\n\nreject CPD’s characterization of the photos as “mug shots.” The persons who act as fillers in\n\nlineups may be police officers, individuals in jail, or civilians. There is no way for anyone to tell\n\nby looking at the photographic lineup which category any given individual falls into when all\n\nidentifying information has been redacted. Second, civilians and police officers who act as fillers\n\nhave voluntarily consented to have their photographs viewed by strangers and possibly introduced\n\nas evidence in criminal cases and therefore can have no expectation of personal privacy in the\n\n\n                                                   18\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nphotos. The only conceivable privacy interest at stake is that of the individuals in jail who have\n\nnot necessarily consented to the use of their photographs in the lineups. However, even if it\n\nwould be possible to determine which fillers are individuals who are or were in jail, the likelihood\n\nthat someone viewing the photographs will recognize a photo and link that person to a separate\n\ncase in which he or she may be a suspect or may have been charged is remote; therefore the\n\ndegree of invasion of personal privacy does not outweigh the remaining factors. Thus, we\n\nconclude that the release of the photos with all identifying information redacted does not\n\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. We also note that the Evanston Police\n\nDepartment has released the photographic lineups with the photos intact and only the identifying\n\ninformation redacted.\n\n       Finally, NACDL contends that the circuit courts erred in holding that the production of\n\ndocuments from the police files in closed cases outside of the report data would create an undue\n\nburden on the police agencies. NACDL argues that the circuit courts understated the public\n\ninterest in disclosure of the records while overvaluing the burden that redaction would impose on\n\nthe police agencies. CPD contends that NACDL is requesting the entire investigatory file for\n\neach case, including many documents that do not even relate to identification procedures, and\n\nstates that redacting all of these documents would be a massive undertaking. Moreover, CPD\n\nargues that if it is required to produce the same information for the open investigations, the\n\nburden will include the redaction of the report data in addition to the investigative files. At oral\n\nargument, counsel for CPD estimated that redacting these files will take approximately 150 hours\n\nor 20 personnel days. Also, the individual responsible for making the redactions will need to\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nconsult with detectives on a case-by-case basis. NACDL responds that it is only requesting those\n\ndocuments in the investigation files that pertain to eyewitness identification, e.g., police records\n\nthat directly describe the lineups and photo arrays or show prior contact between the eyewitness\n\nand the suspect. NACDL contends that these records will primarily be found in lineup reports\n\nand supplementary reports.\n\n       As an initial matter, we note that FOIA contains a specific requirement for the party\n\nseeking to claim the undue burden exemption. “Before invoking this exemption, the public body\n\nshall extend to the person making the request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to\n\nreduce the request to manageable proportions.” 5 ILCS 140/3(f) (West 2006). Our review of the\n\nrecord does not disclose any evidence that the police agencies sought to confer with NACDL in\n\nan attempt to reduce the request prior to the circuit court’s ruling that the undue burden\n\nexemption applied to certain documents. There is also no evidence that the police agencies\n\ncontacted NACDL to discuss ways to reduce the request before seeking to invoke the undue\n\nburden exemption before this court. CPD states in its brief that the burden on the agency “cannot\n\nbe alleviated by narrowing the request,” however, it does not provide any support for this\n\nassertion. In fact, NACDL notes in its reply brief that the police agencies involved in this appeal\n\nnever conferred with NACDL regarding their claim that compliance would be unduly burdensome\n\nand never attempted to explore whether there would be any way to satisfy NACDL’s request by\n\nproducing only the relevant portions of the investigation files. For this reason alone, it appears\n\nthat the police agencies have not complied with FOIA and cannot claim the undue burden\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nexemption. However, we will still consider whether the circuit court erred in determining that the\n\nburden on the agencies outweighed the public interest.\n\n        In order for the exemption to apply, compliance must be unduly burdensome, there must\n\nbe no way to narrow the request, and the burden on the public body must outweigh the public\n\ninterest in the information. 5 ILCS 140/3(f) (West 2006). As discussed above, the police\n\nagencies have never attempted to see if the request can be narrowed, and NACDL has stated in its\n\nbrief that most of the additional information it is requesting from the police files can be found in\n\ntwo reports. NACDL further stated that, with dialogue between the parties, it believes\n\nagreements could be reached to narrow the range of documents to be redacted. Indeed, the\n\nEvanston Police Department was able to reach an agreement with NACDL to produce all of the\n\nrequested documents with redactions. Moreover, the public interest at stake in obtaining these\n\ndocuments is significant, both for the people of Illinois and for people across the country who are\n\nconsidering the results of the Illinois study. Wrongful convictions on the basis of mistaken\n\neyewitness identification impose a huge cost on society in addition to the cost imposed on the\n\nindividual who is wrongfully convicted. One such cost that has not been highlighted in the\n\naffidavits or briefs is that if the wrong person is convicted, the actual perpetrator is still at large\n\nand continues to pose a danger to society. If an examination of the data used in the study\n\nconfirms that the results were correct, it allows researchers to focus on other possible methods of\n\nreform for identification procedures. If, however, an examination of the data discloses flaws in\n\nthe study methodology or design, reform based on the sequential, double-blind identification\n\nprocedures is still a possibility in Illinois, as well as in other states that have been considering such\n\n\n                                                   21\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nreform. As emphasized in the affidavit submitted by Steblay, the controversial results of the study\n\ncannot be analyzed without access to the identification histories contained in the police\n\ninvestigation files.\n\n        The importance of the public interest at stake is further demonstrated by an amicus curiae\n\nbrief filed in support of NACDL by: The Innocence Network; The Northampton (Mass.) Police\n\nDepartment; Captain Kenneth Patenaude of the Northampton Police Department; Sergeant Paul\n\nCarroll (retired), formerly of the Chicago Police Department; Steven D. Penrod, Department of\n\nPsychology, John Jay College of Criminal Justice; D. Michael Risinger, Seton Hall University\n\nSchool of Law; Jon B. Gould, Chair, Innocence Commission for Virginia and Director, Center for\n\nJustice, Law & Society, George Mason University; Maurice Possley, freelance journalist; and\n\nLaura Spinney, freelance journalist. The brief argues that without the necessary scientific review\n\nof this study, which requires access to the requested documents, the development of research in\n\nthis crucial field will be hampered, progress in dealing with the problem of mistaken eyewitness\n\nidentification will be stalled, and, even more tragically, this stalled progress will lead to additional\n\nwrongful convictions based on erroneous eyewitness identifications.\n\n        CPD cites several cases in support of its argument that the undue burden exemption\n\napplies. CPD’s reliance on these cases is misplaced. In Farley v. Worley, 215 W. Va. 412, 424,\n\n599 S.E.2d 835, 847 (2004), the court held that in response to a proper FOIA request, “a public\n\nbody has a duty to redact or segregate exempt from non-exempt information contained within the\n\npublic record(s) responsive to the FOIA request and to disclose the nonexempt information unless\n\nsuch segregation or redaction would impose *** an unreasonably high burden or expense.” The\n\n\n                                                   22\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\ncourt in Farley required the public body to provide the redacted material in response to the FOIA\n\nrequest. Farley, 215 W. Va. at 425, 599 S.E.2d at 848. In ACLU Foundation of Northern\n\nCalifornia v. Deukmejian, 32 Cal. 3d 440, 453, 651 P.2d 822, 830, 186 Cal. Rptr. 235, 243\n\n(1982), the court held that the burden of segregating exempt from nonexempt material on 100\n\nindex cards was substantial and the utility of disclosure was questionable where the deletion of\n\npersonal identifiers would make it impossible for the appellant to learn whether a particular person\n\nhad been improperly listed as an associate of a criminal suspect.\n\n       A request that is overly broad and requires the public body to locate, review, redact and\n\narrange for inspection a vast quantity of material that is largely unnecessary to the appellants’\n\npurpose constitutes an undue burden. American Federation of Government Employees, Local\n\n2782 v. United States Department of Commerce, 907 F.2d 203, 208-09 (D.C. Cir. 1990).            The\n\nrequests at issue in American Federation would have required the public body to locate every\n\nchronological office file and correspondence file, internal and external, for every branch office,\n\nstaff office, etc. and the information had little or nothing to do with the stated purpose. American\n\nFederation, 907 F.2d at 209. In the instant case, the request specifically targets the police files\n\nfor those cases that were used in the study and the information requested is essential to a\n\nmeaningful review of that study.\n\n       We do not agree with the circuit court that “several weeks of full-time work by [CPD]\n\npersonnel who need to possess a high level of knowledge and sophistication” is sufficiently\n\nburdensome to outweigh the important public interest at stake here. The results of this study have\n\ngarnered nationwide attention on an issue of vital importance to our criminal justice system.\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nMoreover, the circuit court’s order presumed that the police agencies would have to redact the\n\nentire investigatory file in each case. NACDL has stated that it does not need access to every\n\ndocument in each file. It has proposed ways to narrow the request and expressed a willingness to\n\nenter into dialogue with the police agencies in an attempt to further reduce the burden. We\n\nconclude that the burden on the police agencies of redacting any identifying information is not so\n\nexcessive that it outweighs the vital public interest in the disclosure of these documents.\n\nTherefore, we reverse the orders of the circuit courts holding that production of the data from the\n\ninvestigative files in closed cases is unduly burdensome. We also reject CPD’s argument that\n\nproduction of the data from the investigative files in open cases would constitute an undue\n\nburden. We remand for the police agencies to produce the requested documents from the\n\ninvestigative files in open and closed cases with the agreed redactions after conferring with\n\nNACDL to reach a final agreement on narrowing the request to those documents that are relevant\n\nto its analysis of the study.\n\n                                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit courts’ grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of NACDL requiring production of the report data in the closed cases. We reverse the\n\ncircuit courts’ grant of summary judgment in favor of the police departments protecting the report\n\ndata and investigative files in the open cases and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.

(West 2006)). NACDL requested the data used to assemble a\n\nlegislatively mandated study of eyewitness identification procedures by the Chicago Police\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nDepartment, the Joliet Police Department and two other police agencies. The Chicago and Joliet\n\nPolice Departments tendered final administrative responses to the requests, declining to produce\n\nthe majority of the data requested. NACDL filed suit against both agencies, seeking to compel\n\nproduction of the requested data. The parties in the Chicago case filed cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment. NACDL also filed a motion for summary judgment in the Joliet case. Both\n\ntrial courts directed defendants to produce some of the requested data but ruled that the majority\n\nof the information sought was either protected from disclosure by FOIA’s law enforcement and\n\nprivacy exemptions or was too burdensome for the agencies to produce. On appeal, NACDL\n\ncontends that: (1) the law enforcement and privacy exemptions of FOIA do not bar disclosure of\n\npolice data after all personal identifying information has been redacted, (2) the generic and\n\nconclusory statements in police affidavits are insufficient to satisfy the police agency’s burden of\n\nproof to show that an exemption applies, (3) the privacy exemption of FOIA does not bar the\n\ndisclosure of photographs used in lineups after all personal identifying information has been\n\nredacted, and (4) the burden of redacting identifying information does not outweigh the public\n\ninterest in obtaining the requested data. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial courts’\n\npartial grant of summary judgment in favor of NACDL, reverse the trial courts’ grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Chicago and Joliet Police Departments and remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In 2003, the Illinois General Assembly passed section 107A-10 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure of 1963 (725 ILCS 5/107A-10 (West 2006)). This legislation directed the Illinois\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nState Police to conduct a one-year pilot study in the field on the effectiveness of the sequential\n\nmethod for lineup procedures. Under the sequential method, a witness is shown lineup\n\nparticipants one at a time and must state whether the individual shown is the perpetrator of the\n\ncrime before viewing the next lineup participant. Moreover, the lineup administrator must be\n\nsomeone who does not know which participant is the suspect. 725 ILCS 5/107A-10(c)(2) (West\n\n2006). The traditional lineup procedure involves the simultaneous viewing of all lineup\n\nparticipants, and the lineup administrator usually knows which participants are suspects and which\n\nparticipants are “fillers,” i.e., persons who are not suspects themselves but bear a physical\n\nresemblance to the suspect. The statute directed the Illinois State Police to select three police\n\ndepartments to participate in the study (725 ILCS 5/107A-10(b) (West 2006)) and Chicago, Joliet\n\nand Evanston were selected. The study was conducted in 2004 and 2005.\n\n       The program director of the Illinois study released a report of the study’s findings on\n\nMarch 17, 2006. The report concluded that the Illinois data did not bear out the research\n\nexperiments that suggest that sequential, double-blind lineups produce a lower rate of known false\n\nidentifications. Instead, the study found that the sequential, double-blind procedures resulted in\n\nan overall higher rate of known false identifications than did the simultaneous lineups. The five\n\ncategories in particular for which the study concluded that the sequential, double-blind procedures\n\nmay produce a higher rate of false identifications are: (1) child witnesses, (2) older witnesses, (3)\n\ncross-racial identifications, (4) multiple perpetrators, and (5) suspects who do not match the\n\ndescription because of a change in appearance.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n        The Illinois study was one of the first to compare the two methods in the field. The\n\nresults of the study received national publicity and have been criticized by social science\n\nresearchers who have cited flaws in the study design and the failure of the report’s authors to\n\nsubmit the study for scientific peer review. NACDL sent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\n\nrequests to the Illinois State Police and the three police departments designated as participants in\n\nthe study. The FOIA requests sought the following information: (1) the procedures followed by\n\ninvestigating officers in the control group of cases which followed the traditional simultaneous\n\nlineup method, including documentation on whether each live lineup was a first viewing of a\n\nsuspect by an eyewitness or if the eyewitness had previously identified the suspect in a photo\n\nlineup, (2) the training materials and records for police personnel participating in the study, (3)\n\nrecords regarding the retention of certain personnel in connection with the study, (4) the criminal\n\ncourt case numbers for each case included in the study together with the corresponding photos\n\nand recordings of lineups and all photos shown to an eyewitness during a photo spread or\n\nsequential photo array, and (5) the complete database of information used to generate the data\n\ntables in the report.\n\n        The Chicago Police Department (CPD) denied the request, stating that it did not have\n\nsome of the requested documents and claiming that the remaining documents were exempt from\n\ndisclosure under the law enforcement exemption of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) and (d) (West\n\n2006)). The Joliet Police Department (JPD) disclosed some of the requested documents, stated\n\nthat it did not have some of the requested documents, and claimed that the remaining documents\n\nwere exempt from disclosure under the privacy and law enforcement exemptions of FOIA (5\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nILCS 140/7(1)(b), (c)(i) and (viii) (West 2006)). The Evanston Police Department also denied\n\nthe request, and the Illinois State Police produced some documents but declined to produce\n\ndocuments belonging to the various police departments. NACDL filed lawsuits in Cook and Will\n\ncounties against the four police agencies, seeking to compel production of the requested\n\ndocuments. The Evanston Police Department reached an agreement early on in the litigation with\n\nNACDL to provide the requested documents with redactions and is not a party to this appeal.\n\nThe Illinois State Police remains a party in the Chicago case, but is taking no active role in the\n\nlitigation and informed NACDL that it will comply with any applicable court order regarding the\n\ndisclosure of the documents in its possession from the designated police departments.\n\n       CPD filed a motion for summary judgment with supporting materials. CPD asserted that\n\nthe requested documents were exempt from production because their release would (1) constitute\n\nan invasion of both public and personal privacy, (2) interfere with pending law enforcement\n\nproceedings, (3) obstruct ongoing criminal investigations, and (4) disclose information specifically\n\nprohibited from disclosure under federal and state law, citing sections 7(1)(a), (b) and (c) of FOIA\n\n(5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a), (b)(v), (c)(i), (c)(vi), (c)(viii) (West 2006)). Moreover, the research\n\nrequired to determine whether each matter remained pending would constitute an undue burden\n\npursuant to section 3(f) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/3(f) (West 2006)).\n\n       In support of its motion, CPD submitted the affidavits of Officer Matthew Sandoval and\n\nLieutenant James Gibson. Sandoval stated that he had conducted a random sampling of 10 cases\n\nused in the study and his sample research indicated that of the 250 investigations involved in the\n\nstudy, approximately half of the investigations were still open. Gibson submitted two affidavits.\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nIn the first affidavit, he stated that for open investigations, releasing the requested documents\n\n“could very well interfere” with the investigations. Suspects could become aware of the status of\n\nan investigation, what the police know and what evidence they have. Disclosure could also\n\npresent a risk to the safety of witnesses and their families. In the second affidavit, Gibson stated\n\nthat for open cases, even a redacted document could still possibly be linked to an ongoing\n\ninvestigation because although the crime may have occurred in a large city, the members of the\n\nsmall community in which the crime occurred could recognize the details of a specific incident and\n\nthe safety of victims and witnesses could be compromised. Gibson further stated that if a\n\nredacted document was linked to an ongoing investigation, an at-large perpetrator could become\n\naware of what evidence the police have against him and could learn about specific police\n\ninvestigative techniques. Gibson said there is no way to adequately redact these documents\n\nbecause no single employee possesses the knowledge and discretion to determine what\n\ninformation needs to be redacted. Gibson also stated that releasing photographs of lineup\n\nparticipants “could constitute a violation of privacy.” Finally, Gibson conceded that documents in\n\nclosed cases could be released if the following information is redacted: (1) all personal identifying\n\ninformation of victims, witnesses and suspects, (2) the exact location of the incident, (3) the\n\nidentities of individual lineup participants, and (4) the exact date, internal records division (RD)\n\nnumbers, and other identifying codes.\n\n       NACDL filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, explaining that the police data was\n\nnecessary to advance an ongoing public debate about the problem of erroneous eyewitness\n\nidentifications in criminal investigations. NACDL submitted the affidavits of Rob Warden,\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nexecutive director of the Northwestern University School of Law Center on Wrongful\n\nConvictions, Norman Reimer, NACDL’s executive director, and professor Nancy Steblay, a\n\nsocial psychologist with expertise in eyewitness identification research whom NACDL retained as\n\na consultant.\n\n       Warden is a specialist in legal affairs, focusing primarily on wrongful convictions. He\n\nnoted that in 59.3% of the documented wrongful convictions in Illinois since 1900, or 54 out of\n\n91 known cases, eyewitness identification was the principal prosecution evidence. Warden stated\n\nthat erroneous eyewitness identification is by far the most prevalent factor in wrongful\n\nconvictions. Moreover, wrongful convictions entail enormous social costs, e.g., 601 years\n\ncollectively behind bars for the 54 men and women known to have been wrongfully convicted and\n\n$39 million for taxpayers in just three civil rights actions stemming from these convictions.\n\nWarden explained that the results of the study have had a profound effect on public policy in\n\nIllinois, making it unlikely that the Illinois General Assembly will act to reform police\n\nidentification procedures. Reimer provided examples of situations in which opponents of\n\nreforming lineup procedures have used the results of the study to support the use of traditional\n\nlineup procedures. Steblay stated that the results of the study contradicted decades of scientific\n\nresearch. The study has also been criticized in the scientific community for flaws in its design and\n\nmethodology and a panel of researchers declared it unreliable as a basis for determining effective\n\neyewitness identification procedures. Steblay further stated that she is acting as a consultant to\n\nNACDL without a consulting fee. Her role as a consultant is not to promote one lineup strategy\n\nover another, but to advocate for sound science particularly as it informs public policy.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n       Oral arguments were scheduled on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, and\n\nthe court recommended that the parties consider settling the case under an agreement whereby the\n\nCPD would provide NACDL with the requested, redacted police records subject to a protective\n\norder prohibiting their dissemination. The parties were unable to reach an agreement; however,\n\nduring settlement negotiations, NACDL learned that there had been a misunderstanding regarding\n\nthe scope of its FOIA request. NACDL also learned that the researchers had not had access to all\n\nof the police records concerning the investigations that were included in the study but had been\n\nfurnished with a form summarizing the outcome of the lineups and some limited documentation\n\nfrom individual investigations. CPD had interpreted the request to include only those documents\n\nto which the researchers had access (report data). This misunderstanding led to the filing of\n\nsupplemental arguments and evidence by both parties.\n\n       NACDL submitted a second affidavit of Steblay, in which she explained why a meaningful\n\ncritique of the study required access to all of the records in order to determine whether important\n\nidentification history had been excluded from the study. CPD submitted the affidavit of assistant\n\ncorporation counsel Amber Ritter, in which she estimated that redacting the full police file for\n\neach investigation included in the study would take 170 hours.\n\n       In the Joliet case, NACDL filed a motion for summary judgment that was identical to the\n\nmotion it filed in the Chicago case. JPD responded, submitting the affidavits of Officer Robert\n\nPuleo and Deputy Police Chief Patrick Kerr. Puleo estimated that it would take 197 person hours\n\nto redact the 257 police files that had been included in the study. Kerr’s affidavit was similar to\n\nthe Gibson affidavits that were submitted in the Chicago case. He stated that the disclosure of the\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nrequested documents “could very well” interfere with ongoing police investigations. He further\n\nstated that the release of the police reports would constitute an invasion of privacy of the victims\n\nand witnesses involved.\n\n       In the Chicago case, the circuit court analyzed open and closed investigations separately,\n\nand also distinguished the report data from the remaining information contained in the police\n\ninvestigation files. With respect to the open files, the court determined that these files were\n\nexempt under section 7(1)(c) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) (West 2006)), relying on Gibson’s\n\naffidavits. For the closed files, CPD agreed to produce the report data with all personal\n\nidentifying information redacted. This left three unresolved issues with respect to the closed files:\n\n(1) redaction of the faces from the photographs of lineup participants, (2) redaction of the RD\n\nnumbers, and (3) production of the remaining information in the police investigation files. The\n\ncourt found that the privacy interests of the lineup participants outweighed the interests of\n\nNACDL and the public in viewing the photographs and ruled that CPD could redact the faces in\n\nthe photographs. However, the court ruled that CPD could not redact the RD numbers because\n\nclosed files are already in the public record so the release of a number that would allow NACDL\n\nto match a police file to a specific case would not constitute an invasion of privacy. Finally, the\n\ncourt ruled that the production of information in the police investigation files that was not part of\n\nthe report data would impose a substantial burden on CPD, and that the public interest in the data\n\ndid not outweigh the burden of redacting the documents.\n\n       In the Joliet case, the circuit court held that the information in open cases was exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under sections 7(1)(b) and (c) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b)(v), (c)(iii), (c)(viii)\n\n\n                                                  9\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n(West 2006)). The circuit court granted NACDL’s motion for summary judgment in part and\n\nordered JPD to produce the report data in the closed cases with all personal identifying\n\ninformation redacted. The court held that the photographs in the closed cases were exempt from\n\ndisclosure under section 7(1)(b) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b)(v) (West 2006)). Finally, the court\n\nheld that JPD did not have to produce information from closed cases that was not part of the\n\nreport data because the redaction of identifying information contained in those materials would\n\nimpose an undue burden on the department.\n\n       NACDL filed notices of appeal in the First District in the Chicago case and in the Third\n\nDistrict in the Joliet case.

The only significant difference between the Chicago and Joliet cases is that the\n\nparties in the Chicago case filed cross-motions for summary judgment, while JPD merely filed a\n\nresponse to NACDL’s motion for summary judgment. Both lower courts ordered the disclosure\n\nof some of the requested documents and held that the remaining documents were protected from\n\ndisclosure under various exemptions in FOIA. The order in the Joliet case states that “all matters\n\nin controversy have been resolved.” There was nothing else for the parties to litigate in the Joliet\n\ncase. This court is not deprived of jurisdiction because the motion for summary judgment was\n\npartially denied and the court did not specifically enter judgment in favor of JPD. The denial of\n\nNACDL’s motion for summary judgment as to the majority of the requested documents operated\n\nas a judgment in favor of JPD. The court accepted JPD’s argument that the documents were\n\nexempt from disclosure and the order terminated the litigation between the parties. Indeed,\n\nappeal was the only recourse left to NACDL in its attempt to obtain the documents. Thus, we\n\nconclude that the order was final and appealable and this court has jurisdiction over the Joliet\n\n\n                                                   11\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\ncase.\n\n        We now turn to the issues on appeal. FOIA declares that it is “the public policy of the\n\nState of Illinois that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs\n\nof government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them as public officials\n\nand public employees consistent with the terms of this Act. Such access is necessary to enable the\n\npeople to fulfill their duties of discussing public issues fully and freely, making informed political\n\njudgments and monitoring government to ensure that it is being conducted in the public interest.”\n\n5 ILCS 140/1 (West 2006).\n\n        The legislature recognized that even with such a policy certain documents should not be\n\ndisclosed, and it dedicated section 7 of FOIA to exemptions. This section provides, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n                   “(1) The following shall be exempt from inspection and copying:\n\n                        ***\n\n                        (b) Information that, if disclosed, would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\n                        invasion of personal privacy***. ***Information exempted under this\n\n                        subsection (b) shall include but is not limited to:\n\n                                                         ***\n\n                                (v) information revealing the identity of persons who file complaints\n\n                                with or provide information to *** law enforcement *** agencies;\n\n                                                         ***\n\n                        (c) Records compiled by any public body for administrative enforcement\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n                    proceedings and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law\n\n                    enforcement purposes or for internal matters of a public body, but only to\n\n                    the extent that disclosure would:\n\n                            (i) interfere with pending or actually and reasonably contemplated\n\n                            law enforcement proceedings conducted by any law enforcement or\n\n                            correctional agency;\n\n                                                    ***\n\n                            (iv) unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source or\n\n                            confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;\n\n                            (v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other\n\n                            than those generally used and known ***;\n\n                            (vi) constitute an invasion of personal privacy under subsection (b)\n\n                            of this Section;\n\n                            (vii) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement\n\n                            personnel or any other person; or\n\n                            (viii) obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation.” 5 ILCS 140/7\n\n                            (West 2006).\n\n      Finally, FOIA provides:\n\n                “Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be complied with\n\n             unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for the\n\n             complying public body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden\n\n\n                                               13\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n               on the public body outweighs the public interest in the information.

With that in mind, this court must address the following\n\nissues: (1) whether the circuit courts erred in determining that all data in the open investigations is\n\nprotected from disclosure under the privacy and law enforcement exemptions and, if so, whether\n\nthe undue burden exemption applies, (2) whether the circuit courts erred in determining that the\n\nfaces in the photographic lineups should be redacted, and (3) whether the circuit courts erred in\n\ndetermining that redacting the documents from the police investigation files would impose an\n\nundue burden on the police agencies.\n\n       NACDL first contends that the trial courts in both cases erred in holding that the affidavits\n\nsubmitted by CPD and JPD were sufficient to invoke the law enforcement and privacy exemptions\n\nin case files involving ongoing investigations. After the circuit courts in both cases ruled on this\n\nissue, this court issued an opinion in Day v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2019788\"><a href=\"/opinion/2019788/day-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009). In Day, this court held that affidavits submitted by Sandoval and Gibson (that\n\nappear to be nearly identical to the affidavits submitted by these same individuals in the instant\n\ncase) were entirely conclusory and inadequate to sustain the city’s burden to show that the\n\nrequested documents were exempt. Day, 388 Ill. App. 3d at 75, 902 N.E.2d at 1149. The case\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nwas remanded and the circuit court was directed to conduct an in camera review of the\n\ndocuments in order to determine whether the law enforcement or privacy exemptions applied.\n\nDay, 388 Ill. App. 3d at 80, 902 N.E.2d at 1153.\n\n       CPD concedes that after Day, the affidavits submitted are insufficient to support its claim\n\nthat the documents are protected under the law enforcement and privacy exemptions of FOIA.\n\nHowever, because the circuit courts ruled that the production of documents outside of the report\n\ndata in the closed cases would be unduly burdensome, CPD asks this court to extend that\n\nrationale to all documents in the open investigations. If this court should conclude that\n\nproduction of the documents would not be unduly burdensome, CPD asks this court to remand\n\nfor an in camera review of the documents to determine whether the law enforcement and privacy\n\nexemptions apply. To avoid undue burden on the circuit court, CPD suggests that the circuit\n\ncourt limit its review to those files that contain some marker indicating that production of the\n\ndocuments would obstruct the investigation, e.g., cases in which there is a living perpetrator still\n\nat large. CPD further suggests that the circuit court may limit its review to a sample of the\n\ndocuments.\n\n       NACDL asks this court to reverse the circuit courts outright and order the police agencies\n\nto submit the requested data in open cases with redactions. NACDL contends that records in\n\nwhich all identifying information is redacted will not yield information that would threaten the\n\nsafety of a witness or provide information to an at-large suspect. Alternatively, NACDL asks this\n\ncourt to require that the police agencies review the requested records, perform the redactions, and\n\npresent to the court for in camera inspection any specific records for which they believe there is a\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nreasonable possibility that disclosure even with redactions could obstruct or impede law\n\nenforcement.\n\n        We agree with both parties that the affidavits submitted to the circuit courts were\n\ninsufficient to satisfy the burden of showing that any statutory exemption applies. Moreover, for\n\nthe reasons discussed below, we reject CPD’s argument that redaction of the open investigation\n\nfiles would be unduly burdensome. We do not agree that the order of the circuit court granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the police agencies should be reversed outright, but we also do not\n\nthink it is appropriate for the circuit court to conduct an in camera review of all documents in the\n\nopen investigation files to determine whether an exemption applies. In Day, the police files in\n\nquestion involved a single criminal investigation. In the instant case, there are still potentially over\n\n100 cases in which the investigations are ongoing. It is possible that there are some investigations\n\nin which production of the data could compromise an ongoing investigation, even with all\n\nidentifying information redacted. However, we do not think such a scenario is likely in the\n\nmajority of open investigations, nor will it be as easy to identify witnesses in redacted files as the\n\nGibson affidavits suggest. The fact that witnesses, victims and perpetrators may all live in the\n\nsame neighborhood and attend the same schools does not mean that the safety of a witness could\n\nbe compromised if the documents are released. Both parties agree that the location of the crime\n\nand all personal identifying information and other unique identifiers will be redacted; therefore, it\n\nwill be impossible to tell where the crime occurred and what individuals may have been involved\n\nin the majority of cases.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n       On remand, the parties should presume that all requested documents in the open\n\ninvestigations are to be produced, subject to the agreed redactions. The burden is on the police\n\nagencies to demonstrate on a case-by-case basis specifically how a particular witness could be in\n\ndanger or how an individual investigation could be compromised if a document is disclosed in\n\nwhich all identifying information has been redacted. Moreover, any affidavits submitted in\n\nsupport of a statutory exemption must conform to the level of specificity required in Day.\n\nHowever, we note that our supreme court has indicated that while summary judgment would be\n\nappropriate without in camera review if the affidavits show with reasonable specificity why the\n\ndocuments fall within the claimed exemption, in camera review is the most effective way for the\n\npublic body to objectively demonstrate that the exemption claimed does, in fact, apply. Illinois\n\nEducation Ass’n v. Illinois State Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2130389\"><a href=\"/opinion/2130389/iea-v-illinois-state-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470-71, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2130389\"><a href=\"/opinion/2130389/iea-v-illinois-state-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n531 (2003).\n\n       We reverse the orders of the circuit courts granting summary judgment in favor of the\n\npolice agencies for documents in open investigations. We remand for the police agencies to\n\nreview the files and determine which documents, if any, meet the statutory exemptions even after\n\nthe agreed redactions are made. Those documents should then be presented to the circuit court\n\nfor an in camera inspection to determine whether the exemptions do, in fact, apply.\n\n       Next, NACDL contends that the circuit courts erred in holding that the faces in the\n\nphotographic lineups are exempt from disclosure because their release would constitute an\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy. NACDL argues that once all personal identifying\n\ninformation is removed from the photographs, the persons who typically act as fillers in lineups\n\n\n                                                17\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nwill have only a minimal privacy interest in the photographs. CPD argues that there is a stigma\n\nassociated with “mug shots” and that the faces in the photographs could be recognized and\n\nidentified even if all personal identifying information is redacted.\n\n        To determine whether disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal\n\nprivacy, courts take into account (1) the plaintiff’s interest in disclosure, (2) the public interest in\n\ndisclosure, (3) the degree of invasion of personal privacy, and (4) the availability of alternative\n\nmeans of obtaining the requested information. Lieber, 176 Ill. 2d at 408-09, 680 N.E.2d at 378.\n\nNADCL’s interest and the public interest are essentially the same. As part of its analysis of the\n\nstudy, NACDL needs to assess the quality of the composition of the lineups in the study. This\n\ninformation is separate and distinct from the identification history and other information that will\n\nbe analyzed from the report data and investigation files. A meaningful analysis of the study must\n\ninclude an assessment of the lineups that were actually used. Moreover, the actual photographs\n\nare the only means available to researchers to determine the composition of the lineups that were\n\nused in the study.\n\n        On the other hand, the degree of invasion of personal privacy is insignificant. First, we\n\nreject CPD’s characterization of the photos as “mug shots.” The persons who act as fillers in\n\nlineups may be police officers, individuals in jail, or civilians. There is no way for anyone to tell\n\nby looking at the photographic lineup which category any given individual falls into when all\n\nidentifying information has been redacted. Second, civilians and police officers who act as fillers\n\nhave voluntarily consented to have their photographs viewed by strangers and possibly introduced\n\nas evidence in criminal cases and therefore can have no expectation of personal privacy in the\n\n\n                                                   18\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nphotos. The only conceivable privacy interest at stake is that of the individuals in jail who have\n\nnot necessarily consented to the use of their photographs in the lineups. However, even if it\n\nwould be possible to determine which fillers are individuals who are or were in jail, the likelihood\n\nthat someone viewing the photographs will recognize a photo and link that person to a separate\n\ncase in which he or she may be a suspect or may have been charged is remote; therefore the\n\ndegree of invasion of personal privacy does not outweigh the remaining factors. Thus, we\n\nconclude that the release of the photos with all identifying information redacted does not\n\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. We also note that the Evanston Police\n\nDepartment has released the photographic lineups with the photos intact and only the identifying\n\ninformation redacted.\n\n       Finally, NACDL contends that the circuit courts erred in holding that the production of\n\ndocuments from the police files in closed cases outside of the report data would create an undue\n\nburden on the police agencies. NACDL argues that the circuit courts understated the public\n\ninterest in disclosure of the records while overvaluing the burden that redaction would impose on\n\nthe police agencies. CPD contends that NACDL is requesting the entire investigatory file for\n\neach case, including many documents that do not even relate to identification procedures, and\n\nstates that redacting all of these documents would be a massive undertaking. Moreover, CPD\n\nargues that if it is required to produce the same information for the open investigations, the\n\nburden will include the redaction of the report data in addition to the investigative files. At oral\n\nargument, counsel for CPD estimated that redacting these files will take approximately 150 hours\n\nor 20 personnel days. Also, the individual responsible for making the redactions will need to\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nconsult with detectives on a case-by-case basis. NACDL responds that it is only requesting those\n\ndocuments in the investigation files that pertain to eyewitness identification, e.g., police records\n\nthat directly describe the lineups and photo arrays or show prior contact between the eyewitness\n\nand the suspect. NACDL contends that these records will primarily be found in lineup reports\n\nand supplementary reports.\n\n       As an initial matter, we note that FOIA contains a specific requirement for the party\n\nseeking to claim the undue burden exemption. “Before invoking this exemption, the public body\n\nshall extend to the person making the request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to\n\nreduce the request to manageable proportions.” 5 ILCS 140/3(f) (West 2006). Our review of the\n\nrecord does not disclose any evidence that the police agencies sought to confer with NACDL in\n\nan attempt to reduce the request prior to the circuit court’s ruling that the undue burden\n\nexemption applied to certain documents. There is also no evidence that the police agencies\n\ncontacted NACDL to discuss ways to reduce the request before seeking to invoke the undue\n\nburden exemption before this court. CPD states in its brief that the burden on the agency “cannot\n\nbe alleviated by narrowing the request,” however, it does not provide any support for this\n\nassertion. In fact, NACDL notes in its reply brief that the police agencies involved in this appeal\n\nnever conferred with NACDL regarding their claim that compliance would be unduly burdensome\n\nand never attempted to explore whether there would be any way to satisfy NACDL’s request by\n\nproducing only the relevant portions of the investigation files. For this reason alone, it appears\n\nthat the police agencies have not complied with FOIA and cannot claim the undue burden\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nexemption. However, we will still consider whether the circuit court erred in determining that the\n\nburden on the agencies outweighed the public interest.\n\n        In order for the exemption to apply, compliance must be unduly burdensome, there must\n\nbe no way to narrow the request, and the burden on the public body must outweigh the public\n\ninterest in the information. 5 ILCS 140/3(f) (West 2006). As discussed above, the police\n\nagencies have never attempted to see if the request can be narrowed, and NACDL has stated in its\n\nbrief that most of the additional information it is requesting from the police files can be found in\n\ntwo reports. NACDL further stated that, with dialogue between the parties, it believes\n\nagreements could be reached to narrow the range of documents to be redacted. Indeed, the\n\nEvanston Police Department was able to reach an agreement with NACDL to produce all of the\n\nrequested documents with redactions. Moreover, the public interest at stake in obtaining these\n\ndocuments is significant, both for the people of Illinois and for people across the country who are\n\nconsidering the results of the Illinois study. Wrongful convictions on the basis of mistaken\n\neyewitness identification impose a huge cost on society in addition to the cost imposed on the\n\nindividual who is wrongfully convicted. One such cost that has not been highlighted in the\n\naffidavits or briefs is that if the wrong person is convicted, the actual perpetrator is still at large\n\nand continues to pose a danger to society. If an examination of the data used in the study\n\nconfirms that the results were correct, it allows researchers to focus on other possible methods of\n\nreform for identification procedures. If, however, an examination of the data discloses flaws in\n\nthe study methodology or design, reform based on the sequential, double-blind identification\n\nprocedures is still a possibility in Illinois, as well as in other states that have been considering such\n\n\n                                                   21\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nreform. As emphasized in the affidavit submitted by Steblay, the controversial results of the study\n\ncannot be analyzed without access to the identification histories contained in the police\n\ninvestigation files.\n\n        The importance of the public interest at stake is further demonstrated by an amicus curiae\n\nbrief filed in support of NACDL by: The Innocence Network; The Northampton (Mass.) Police\n\nDepartment; Captain Kenneth Patenaude of the Northampton Police Department; Sergeant Paul\n\nCarroll (retired), formerly of the Chicago Police Department; Steven D. Penrod, Department of\n\nPsychology, John Jay College of Criminal Justice; D. Michael Risinger, Seton Hall University\n\nSchool of Law; Jon B. Gould, Chair, Innocence Commission for Virginia and Director, Center for\n\nJustice, Law & Society, George Mason University; Maurice Possley, freelance journalist; and\n\nLaura Spinney, freelance journalist. The brief argues that without the necessary scientific review\n\nof this study, which requires access to the requested documents, the development of research in\n\nthis crucial field will be hampered, progress in dealing with the problem of mistaken eyewitness\n\nidentification will be stalled, and, even more tragically, this stalled progress will lead to additional\n\nwrongful convictions based on erroneous eyewitness identifications.\n\n        CPD cites several cases in support of its argument that the undue burden exemption\n\napplies. CPD’s reliance on these cases is misplaced. In Farley v. Worley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">W.

American Federation of Government Employees, Local\n\n2782 v. United States Department of Commerce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544222\"><a href=\"/opinion/544222/american-federation-of-government-employees-local-2782-edward-v-hanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208-09 (D.C. Cir. 1990).            The\n\nrequests at issue in American Federation would have required the public body to locate every\n\nchronological office file and correspondence file, internal and external, for every branch office,\n\nstaff office, etc. and the information had little or nothing to do with the stated purpose. American\n\nFederation, 907 F.2d at 209. In the instant case, the request specifically targets the police files\n\nfor those cases that were used in the study and the information requested is essential to a\n\nmeaningful review of that study.\n\n       We do not agree with the circuit court that “several weeks of full-time work by [CPD]\n\npersonnel who need to possess a high level of knowledge and sophistication” is sufficiently\n\nburdensome to outweigh the important public interest at stake here. The results of this study have\n\ngarnered nationwide attention on an issue of vital importance to our criminal justice system.\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\nMoreover, the circuit court’s order presumed that the police agencies would have to redact the\n\nentire investigatory file in each case. NACDL has stated that it does not need access to every\n\ndocument in each file. It has proposed ways to narrow the request and expressed a willingness to\n\nenter into dialogue with the police agencies in an attempt to further reduce the burden. We\n\nconclude that the burden on the police agencies of redacting any identifying information is not so\n\nexcessive that it outweighs the vital public interest in the disclosure of these documents.\n\nTherefore, we reverse the orders of the circuit courts holding that production of the data from the\n\ninvestigative files in closed cases is unduly burdensome. We also reject CPD’s argument that\n\nproduction of the data from the investigative files in open cases would constitute an undue\n\nburden. We remand for the police agencies to produce the requested documents from the\n\ninvestigative files in open and closed cases with the agreed redactions after conferring with\n\nNACDL to reach a final agreement on narrowing the request to those documents that are relevant\n\nto its analysis of the study.\n\n                                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit courts’ grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of NACDL requiring production of the report data in the closed cases. We reverse the\n\ncircuit courts’ grant of summary judgment in favor of the police departments protecting the report\n\ndata and investigative files in the open cases and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion. We reverse the circuit courts’ grant of summary judgment in favor of the police\n\ndepartments protecting the investigative files in the closed cases. Finally, we reverse the circuit\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\ncourts’ grant of summary judgment in favor of the police departments protecting the faces in the\n\nphotographic lineups.\n\n       No. 1-08-2073, Affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded with directions.\n\n       No. 1-08-3414, Affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded with directions.\n\n       O’BRIEN and NEVILLE, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n               REPORTER OF DECISIONS - ILLINOIS APPELLATE COURT\n                         (Front Sheet to be Attached to Each case)\n      ________________________________________________________________________\n\n      NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS,\n\n             Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\n      v.\n\nCHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT,\n\n             Defendant-Appellee.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS,\n\n             Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\n      v.\n\nCHIEF OF THE JOLIET POLICE DEPARTMENT,\n\n             Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n                        Nos. 1-08-2073 and 1-08-3414 (consolidated)\n\n                                      Appellate Court of Illinois\n                                    First District, Fourth Division\n\n                                February 25, 2010\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n                 JUSTICE GALLAGHER delivered the opinion of the court.\n\n                            O’BRIEN and NEVILLE, JJ., concur.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f1-08-2073 & 1-08-3414, consolidated\n\n                       Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook County.\n\n                    Honorable Mary Anne Mason, Judge Presiding.\n                   Honorable Bobbi N.
