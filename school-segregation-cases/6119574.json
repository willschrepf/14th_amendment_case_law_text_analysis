Wainer, respondent, argued the cause\n              pro se.\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n        In this appeal from a final judgment of divorce, defendant\n\nMiguel A. Wainer challenges the court's equitable distribution of\n\nmarital      assets,    the   amount    of   alimony    awarded    to   him,       the\n\fallocation   of   college   expenses,    the   failure    to   require   life\n\ninsurance as security for alimony, and the denial of counsel fees.\n\nWe affirm in part, substantially for the reasons set forth in the\n\ntrial court's thirty-nine page decision; but are constrained to\n\nremand in part for a more complete statement of reasons for the\n\ncourt's order regarding college expenses and for an explicit\n\ndetermination regarding life insurance.\n\n                                    I.\n\n     After   twenty-five    years   of   marriage,   plaintiff     Daryl    B.\n\nWainer filed for divorce in December 2013.               The parties' only\n\nchild was then a student at a private university.              Plaintiff was\n\nfifty-six years old and still active in the workplace.             Defendant\n\nwas seventy-nine    years old and retired.           Plaintiff earned a\n\nstipulated annual income of $92,419 and defendant received almost\n\n$13,000 a year in Social Security benefits.              After a four-day\n\ntrial conducted in late 2014 and early 2015, at which the parties\n\nwere the sole witnesses, the trial court awarded defendant open\n\ndurational alimony of $27,500 a year.\n\n     As for equitable distribution, the court allocated to each\n\nparty equal shares of: the parties' personal property; a Fidelity\n\ninvestment account, which the court valued at $78,249; plaintiff's\n\npension, valued at $122,965 and to be distributed pursuant to a\n\nqualified domestic relations order; and the plaintiff's marital\n\n                                    2                                A-4321-14T2\n\fcredit card debt of $25,000.      Regarding an apartment in Buenos\n\nAires that the parties beneficially owned, the court directed the\n\nparties to sell the property within two years, with defendant\n\nreceiving sixty-five percent of the net proceeds and plaintiff\n\nthirty-five percent.    Neither party presented an appraisal of the\n\napartment's value, although defendant opined that it was worth\n\n$350,000, but would be more marketable within two years after\n\ntrial, with an anticipated change in economic policy in Argentina.\n\n     The judge directed the parties to share equally in the payment\n\nof the roughly $34,000 in college loans for the parties' child,\n\nwhich were in plaintiff's name.    The court also required defendant\n\nto pay forty percent of their child's senior year college costs\n\nand other child-related expenses.        The court ordered plaintiff to\n\nretain defendant's share of the Fidelity account, $39,124.50, in\n\nsatisfaction of these obligations and his share of the marital\n\ncredit card debt.\n\n     Finally,   the    court   ordered     that   both   parties    remain\n\nresponsible for their own attorney's fees and costs.           The court\n\ndid not address whether plaintiff was required to maintain life\n\ninsurance to secure the payment of alimony to defendant.\n\n     In his appeal, defendant raises the following points:\n\n\n\n\n                                   3                               A-4321-14T2\n\f            POINT I\n\n            THE FINAL JUDGMENT OF DIVORCE RESTS ON\n            INSUFFICIENT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE IN THE TRIAL\n            RECORD AND INFRINGES CONTROLLING NEW JERSEY\n            LAW.\n\n                 A. THE ALIMONY AND SUPPORT RULINGS.\n\n                 B. THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION RULING.\n\n            POINT II\n\n            THE FAMILY COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN\n            ORDERING DEFENDANT TO PAY HIS OWN COUNSEL\n            FEES.\n\n                                      II.\n\n      We defer to the trial judge's fact findings that are rooted\n\nin   her   familiarity   with   the    case,   her   opportunity   to   make\n\ncredibility judgments based on live testimony, and her expertise\n\nin family matters.     Cesare v. Cesare, 154 N.J. 394, 411-13 (1998).\n\nA trial court has broad discretion to determine alimony and\n\nallocate marital assets subject to equitable distribution.              Clark\n\nv. Clark, 429 N.J. Super. 61, 71 (App. Div. 2012).\n\n      However, the trial court is also obliged to make necessary\n\nfindings of fact and state reasons for its conclusions, to enable\n\nmeaningful appellate review.      Strahan v. Strahan, 402 N.J. Super.\n\n298, 310 (App. Div. 2008); R. 1:7-4.             We will vacate a trial\n\ncourt's award if \"the court clearly abused its discretion, failed\n\nto consider all of the controlling legal principles, made mistaken\n\n\n                                       4                            A-4321-14T2\n\ffindings, or reached a conclusion that could not reasonably have\n\nbeen reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record\n\nafter considering the proofs as a whole.\"              J.E.V. v. K.V., 426\n\nN.J. Super. 475, 485 (App. Div. 2012).            We also are not bound by\n\nthe trial court's legal conclusions.            N.J. Div. of Youth & Family\n\nServs. v. I.S., 202 N.J. 145, 183 (2010).\n\n                                    A.\n\n     Inasmuch as equitable distribution is a factor in determining\n\nalimony, see N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(b)(10), but alimony is not a factor\n\nin determining equitable distribution, see N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23.1,\n\nwe begin by assessing the trial court's equitable distribution\n\nrulings.\n\n     Defendant argues the trial judge committed several errors in\n\nequitably distributing the parties' marital assets. Specifically,\n\ndefendant contends the trial court erred in distributing the\n\nparties' Buenos Aires apartment and marital debt; and failed to\n\ncredit   him   for   alleged   exempt       contributions   to   the   Fidelity\n\naccount.   We are unpersuaded.\n\n     \"The goal of equitable distribution . . . is to effect a fair\n\nand just division of marital assets.\"            Steneken v. Steneken, 367\n\nN.J. Super. 427, 434 (App. Div. 2004), aff'd in part, modified in\n\npart, 183 N.J. 290 (2005).         In equitably distributing marital\n\nproperty, the trial court must engage in a three-prong analysis.\n\n                                        5                               A-4321-14T2\n\fRothman v. Rothman, 65 N.J. 219, 232 (1974).             First, the trial\n\ncourt    must   determine    what   assets    are   subject   to   equitable\n\ndistribution.     Ibid.     Second, the trial court must determine the\n\nvalue of these distributable assets.           Ibid.   Finally, the trial\n\ncourt must consider \"how such allocation can most equitably be\n\nmade.\"    Ibid.    Additionally, the trial court must consider the\n\nstatutory factors set forth in N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23.1.                Sauro v.\n\nSauro, 425 N.J. Super. 555, 576 (App. Div. 2012), certif. denied,\n\n213 N.J. 389 (2013).        The manner of distribution remains within\n\nthe trial court's broad discretion.          See Steneken, supra, 367 N.J.\n\nSuper. at 435.\n\n     \"Generally speaking, in dividing marital assets the court\n\nmust take into account the liabilities as well as the assets of\n\nthe parties.\"     Monte v. Monte, 212 N.J. Super. 557, 567 (App. Div.\n\n1986).    A trial court in a divorce matter has the authority to\n\nallocate marital assets and debt between a husband and wife.              See\n\nIonno v. Ionno, 148 N.J. Super. 259, 262 (App. Div. 1977) (\"Proper\n\nallocation of the responsibility for the debts as between husband\n\nand wife does not necessarily track legal responsibility therefor\n\nto a third party.\").      Additionally, marital debts may be deducted\n\nfrom the total value of the marital estate.             See Pascarella v.\n\nPascarella, 165 N.J. Super. 558, 563 (App. Div. 1979).\n\n\n\n                                      6                              A-4321-14T2\n\f       We discern no merit in defendant's challenge to the court's\n\ndisposition of the parties' Buenos Aires apartment, where they\n\nresided      until    2005,    before   returning        to   the    United   States.\n\nDefendant      contends       the   trial   court    failed     to    consider     the\n\nproperty's value or the carrying costs associated with the sale\n\nof the apartment.         He also alleged there were impediments to the\n\nsale    of    the    apartment,      including      an    ongoing     dispute     with\n\nplaintiff's     son    from     a   different    relationship,        who   allegedly\n\noccupied the apartment for a time.\n\n       The trial court awarded defendant sixty-five percent of the\n\nnet proceeds of the sale of the apartment, as well as allocated\n\nto him the responsibility to pay sixty-five percent of the carrying\n\ncosts until the sale.               The court awarded defendant a larger\n\nproportion of the net proceeds \"in consideration of the limitation\n\nof Plaintiff's alimony obligation . . . .\"\n\n       Defendant shall not be heard to complain that the court lacked\n\nsufficient evidence of the apartment's value, or its costs, to\n\nreasonably and equitably distribute the asset. It was the parties'\n\nobligation, not the court's, to present an appraised value of the\n\nproperty.      See Lavene v. Lavene, 148 N.J. Super. 267, 276 (App.\n\nDiv.) (\"The parties, of course, have the primary obligation of\n\nadducing those proofs which will enable the judge to make sound\n\nand rational valuations.\"), certif. denied, 75 N.J. 28 (1977).                       In\n\n                                            7                                 A-4321-14T2\n\fthe absence of an appraisal or other competent evidence of value,\n\nthe court did the best it could.\n\n     We also shall not disturb the court's decision on the basis\n\nof defendant's contention that plaintiff's son may interfere with\n\nthe sale.   Although both parties testified about various judgments\n\nor claims against defendant in Argentina, none were documented by\n\ncompetent evidence that demonstrated a lien on the apartment or\n\nany other impediment to the sale.        In any event, the testimony at\n\ntrial was that the apartment was titled in the name of plaintiff's\n\nbrother, with the parties' consent.        The brother agreed that the\n\nproperty was beneficially owned by the parties and agreed to\n\ncooperate in its sale.        We find there was sufficient credible\n\nevidence for the court's decision.\n\n     We also reject defendant's claim that he was entitled to a\n\ncredit for contributions to the Fidelity account that he claimed\n\nwere exempt from distribution.          The parties used the Fidelity\n\naccount for various marital expenses.            Defendant testified that\n\nhe contributed almost $43,000 to the Fidelity account, which he\n\nsaid came from the sale of a painting, gifted to him by his\n\nbrother, and an inheritance.      However, the trial court found both\n\nparties commingled exempt funds into this account.             Indeed, the\n\nFidelity    account   was   initially   funded    with   $200,000   from    an\n\notherwise exempt gift to plaintiff from her family.          Moreover, the\n\n                                    8                                A-4321-14T2\n\fevidence did not disclose any effort by defendant to segregate his\n\nexempt funds or to preserve their separate character.\n\n     Defendant bore the burden to prove the basis for exempting\n\nhis property from the marital estate.            Pascale v. Pascale, 140\n\nN.J. 583, 609 (1995).     A gift is subject to distribution if it\n\nsubsidizes the marital lifestyle or is placed into an account with\n\nregular deposits of other non-exempt funds, unless the party\n\ndemonstrates an unequivocal intent to separate the exempt asset.\n\nSee ibid.; Tannen v. Tannen, 416 N.J. Super. 248, 283 (App. Div.\n\n2010), aff'd o.b., 208 N.J. 409 (2011); Wadlow v. Wadlow, 200 N.J.\n\nSuper. 372, 380 (App. Div. 1985). We shall not disturb the court's\n\ntreatment of the Fidelity account as a marital asset.\n\n     Defendant   also   challenges       the   allocation   of   plaintiff's\n\ncredit card debt of $25,000, which she testified was incurred to\n\ncover marital expenses.   He contends the debt was incurred against\n\nhis advice, and the court disregarded his own significant debt.\n\nThe judge stated:\n\n               There is no justification to relieve\n          Defendant from liability for fifty percent\n          (50%) of the parties' marital debt.        The\n          parties have historically used credit cards\n          to fund any shortfall in their monthly living\n          expenditures. It was Defendant who maintained\n          the parties' finances until a few short months\n          before the commencement of trial. Therefore,\n          it is disingenuous for Defendant to claim he\n          was   unaware  of   the   parties'   financial\n          circumstances.\n\n                                     9                               A-4321-14T2\n\fSimply put, there was sufficient credible evidence, consisting of\n\nplaintiff's testimony, that the credit card debt was attributable\n\nto reasonable marital expenses.       Defendant presented no competent\n\ndocumentary evidence to establish the amounts were unreasonable,\n\nor unrelated to marital expenses.\n\n     As   for   his   claim   that   the   judge   disregarded   his   own\n\nsignificant debt, we recognize that he reported, in his December\n\n2014 case information statement, $7000 in his own credit card\n\ndebt, as well as an additional $13,000 owed to a bank.           However,\n\nthe record before us does not illuminate when, and for what, that\n\ndebt was incurred.     Notably, defendant introduced into evidence\n\nan extensive summary of his debt, with multiple attachments.\n\nPlaintiff, as well, introduced documentary evidence of defendant's\n\ncredit cards, because she made payments on the accounts.         However,\n\nsince defendant omitted those exhibits from the appendix on appeal,\n\nwe find no reason to disturb the court's ruling on this issue.\n\nSee Cmty. Hosp. Grp., Inc. v. Blume Goldfaden, 381 N.J. Super.\n\n119, 127 (App. Div. 2005) (We are not \"obliged to attempt [to]\n\nreview . . . an issue when the relevant portions of the record are\n\nnot included.\"); R. 2:6-1(a) (stating appellant must include in\n\nthe appendix \"such other parts of the record . . . as are essential\n\nto the proper consideration of the issues\").\n\n\n\n                                     10                           A-4321-14T2\n\f                                       B.\n\n       Defendant next contends the trial court's alimony award was\n\ninsufficient, given his age and earning capacity.                Specifically,\n\ndefendant argues the trial court \"did not meaningfully weigh and\n\nbalance the [statutory] factors.\"           We disagree.\n\n       The purpose of alimony is to \"provide a dependent spouse with\n\nthe   wherewithal    to   'maintain    a    lifestyle   that   is   reasonably\n\ncomparable to the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage.'\"\n\nSteneken, supra, 367 N.J. Super. at 434 (quoting Crews v. Crews,\n\n164 N.J. 11, 17 (2000)).       In making this determination, the court\n\nshould also consider the payor's earnings and ability to support\n\nthe payee.

From 1990 to 2005, the parties resided in\n\nArgentina, living in aparthotels and rental properties, before\n\npurchasing the apartment in Buenos Aires in 2000.                 While in\n\nArgentina,   defendant    invested     in   a   bicycle   business,     which\n\ndissolved less than a year later.           The parties soon thereafter\n\nopened a private language school, with plaintiff responsible for\n\nteaching and developing the curriculum, and defendant handling the\n\nmarketing and finances.      However, the parties later returned to\n\nNew Jersey in 2005, during the financial crisis in Argentina.\n\n     After returning to New Jersey, plaintiff served as the primary\n\nbreadwinner for the family. At the time of trial, she was employed\n\nby a public school district, earning a stipulated gross annual\n\nincome of $92,419.       In addition to working full-time, she was\n\n\n                                  13                                  A-4321-14T2\n\fpursuing a doctoral degree in education (Ed.D.).      To support her\n\nown     educational   endeavors,   she   had   borrowed   $61,000    in\n\nunsubsidized student loans.\n\n      Defendant, on the other hand, has not experienced the same\n\nsuccess since returning to the United States.         For a time, he\n\nearned modest commissions as a life insurance agent, but that\n\nsource of income dried up.     At the time of trial, he was almost\n\neighty years old, retired, and collecting approximately $13,000\n\nin annual Social Security benefits.1\n\n      In determining plaintiff's alimony obligation, the trial\n\ncourt examined each of the statutory factors outlined in N.J.S.A.\n\n2A:34-23(b).    Although defendant challenges the court's findings\n\nas to several of these factors, we are satisfied, based on our\n\nthorough review of the record, that the court's findings were\n\nsupported by \"adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\"      Cesare,\n\nsupra, 154 N.J. at 412.\n\n      After considering each factor, the court set plaintiff's open\n\ndurational alimony obligation at a fixed amount of $27,500 per\n\nyear.    Notably, in determining plaintiff's alimony obligation, the\n\n\n\n\n1\n Defendant's newly minted claim, in his appellate brief, that his\nbenefits are actually $11,616 lacks any support in the record and\nis at odds with defendant's own CIS and trial testimony.\n\n                                   14                         A-4321-14T2\n\ftrial   court   considered   both   party's   individual   budgets   and\n\ncombined net incomes:\n\n                Plaintiff earns gross wages of $92,419.00\n           and Defendant social security wages of\n           $13,000.00.    These sum nets cannot cover\n           either of the parties' budgets, let alone both\n           of their budgets. The point being, that even\n           while together, their funds were insufficient\n           to meet their living expenses; hence the\n           $25,000 in credit card debt used to supplement\n           living expenses.\n\n                 . . . .\n\n                The   Court  clearly   recognizes   that\n           Plaintiff, upon conference of her doctoral\n           degree, has the potential to increase her\n           earnings and can only surmise that it is the\n           eventuality of the situation. However, that\n           situation does not exist today and the Court\n           cannot determine an alimony award based upon\n           predictions of future earnings, which may\n           never materialize. Plaintiff's current income\n           must be used and that income is $92,419.00.\n\n                The   Court  further   recognizes   that\n           Defendant is at a distinct age disadvantage\n           and is entitled to retire at age eighty (80),\n           albeit a healthy 80.         Therefore, the\n           likelihood of any appreciable increase over\n           and above his social security earning is\n           negligible.\n\n                 . . . .\n\n                The fact is that neither party will be\n           able to maintain the formal marital lifestyle.\n           Using Plaintiff's current budget of $8,274.00\n           and Defendant's current budget of $5,294.00,\n           the Court finds that Plaintiff shall pay to\n           Defendant    open   durational    alimony   of\n           $27,500.00 per year.\n\n\n                                    15                          A-4321-14T2\n\f     Defendant misplaces reliance on Guglielmo v. Guglielmo, 253\n\nN.J. Super. 531, 543-44 (App. Div. 1992), in support of his\n\ncontention that the trial court failed to consider plaintiff's\n\nearning potential in awarding alimony. In Guglielmo, we explained:\n\n          Where a family's expenditures and income had\n          been consistently expanding, the dependent\n          spouse should not be confined to the precise\n          lifestyle enjoyed during the parties' last\n          year together.    Defendant's income picture\n          should be viewed with an eye toward the\n          future, since it was to this potential that\n          both parties contributed during the marriage.\n\n          [Ibid.]\n\n     Here, the record fails to demonstrate that plaintiff's income\n\nhas been consistently expanding.        Plaintiff testified to nothing\n\nmore than her hope that acquiring a doctorate would boost her\n\nincome.    There    was   no   evidence   suggesting   that    she     would\n\nautomatically qualify for a promotion or raise.               As such, we\n\ndiscern no error in the court's decision to utilize plaintiff's\n\ncurrent   income    in    determining      her   alimony      obligation.\n\nAdditionally, should plaintiff experience a significant increase\n\nin pay after receiving her Ed.D., defendant can seek a modification\n\nof alimony based on changed circumstances.        See Lepis v. Lepis,\n\n83 N.J. 139, 146 (1980) (stating that alimony obligations are\n\n\"always subject to review and modification on a showing of 'changed\n\ncircumstances.'\"); see also Quinn v. Quinn, 225 N.J. 34, 49 (2016)\n\n\n                                   16                                A-4321-14T2\n\f(stating \"changed circumstances include . . . an increase or\n\ndecrease in the income of the supporting . . . spouse\") (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n     Defendant's remaining challenges to the alimony award lack\n\nsufficient merit to warrant an extended discussion.      R. 2:11-\n\n3(e)(1)(E).   We add that defendant's reliance on marital fault is\n\nmisdirected, as marital fault is generally irrelevant and the\n\nrecord is bereft of any evidence establishing exceptional fault\n\nof the kind sufficient to impact alimony.   See Mani v. Mani, 183\n\nN.J. 70, 91-92 (2005); Clark, supra, 429 N.J. Super. at 74.\n\nDefendant also objects to the provision in the judgment that\n\nalimony would be subject to suspension or termination if he\n\ncohabits with an unrelated female; however, the provision simply\n\ncomplies with N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(n).\n\n                                C.\n\n     Defendant next contends the trial court erred in obligating\n\nhim to pay fifty percent of the debt already incurred by plaintiff\n\nto finance their child's college education, and forty percent of\n\nfuture educational costs.     Defendant contended he lacked the\n\nability to pay.   He also argued that he opposed plaintiff's and\n\nhis child's choice of an out-of-state private university; instead,\n\nhe favored his child's attendance at City University of New York,\n\n\n\n                                17                         A-4321-14T2\n\fwhere the child could have lived at home and, he argued, reduced\n\ntotal educational costs.\n\n     Although attending an out-of-state private university, the\n\nchild   received   substantial      scholarships     that   covered   all   but\n\n$22,000 of freshman year expenses, and $12,000 of sophomore year\n\nexpenses. Plaintiff borrowed $34,000 to cover the remaining costs.\n\nShe anticipated utilizing a college savings fund for junior year\n\nshortfalls and borrowing again to finance senior year expenses.\n\nPayments on the loans were deferred.\n\n     Plaintiff also testified that the parties' child had a work-\n\nstudy   job,    which   generated    income   used    to    cover   incidental\n\nexpenses.      She also stated that the child remained out-of-state\n\nthe previous summer, having secured a paid summer internship.\n\nHowever, she did not provide detailed evidence of the costs of\n\nsupporting the child, outside the college expenses.\n\n     In allocating half of the $34,000 debt, the court stated:\n\n                 The   Court  further  finds   that  the\n            Defendant shall share equally in the payment\n            of [the child's] school loans incurred to\n            date. [The child], through scholarships, has\n            been able to reduce the actual out of pocket\n            costs for [the] education to a level\n            commensurate with or actually less than the\n            cost of a state university.      That fact,\n            coupled with the importance placed upon\n            continuing education by the parties, both of\n            whom hold Masters Degrees and one of whom\n            . . . continues to pursue a doctoral degree\n            at age fifty-seven (57) makes clear that if\n\n                                     18                                A-4321-14T2\n\f            they had remained an intact family, they would\n            have done everything possible to fund these\n            costs on [the child's] behalf.\n\nIn allocating forty percent of senior year costs, the court stated\n\n                 Certain college accounts have been set\n            aside for [the child]. The accounts have an\n            approximate value of $15,000.00. This amount\n            is anticipated to be sufficient to cover out-\n            of-pocket expenses for [the child's] junior\n            year . . . . [S]enior year expenses, based\n            upon historical out-of-pocket expenses, are\n            expected to be approximately $22,000.00,\n            provided [the child] receives scholarships at\n            a similar level to those received in . . .\n            freshman and sophomore years.      The parties\n            shall share in [the child's] remaining college\n            expenses, with Plaintiff funding sixty percent\n            (60%)   and   the  Defendant   forty   percent\n            (40%). . . . Plaintiff shall retain the\n            $10,754.50    remaining   in    the   Fidelity\n            Investments account in full satisfaction of\n            Defendant's forty percent (40%) contribution\n            to [the child's] senior year expenses.\n\n     Trial    courts    have     substantial      discretion     in   determining\n\nparents' contribution to college expenses.             See Jacoby v. Jacoby,\n\n427 N.J. Super. 109, 116 (App. Div. 2012); see also Foust v.\n\nGlaser, 340 N.J. Super. 312, 315 (App. Div. 2001).                    However, a\n\ntrial court's decision will be reversed \"if the court ignores\n\napplicable standards[.]\"         Gotlib v. Gotlib, 399 N.J. Super. 295,\n\n309 (App. Div. 2008).\n\n     In Newburgh v. Arrigo, 88 N.J. 529, 545 (1982), the Court set\n\nforth   a   list   of   twelve    factors   for    courts   to    consider    when\n\n\n\n                                      19                                  A-4321-14T2\n\fdetermining a parent's contribution for a child's educational\n\nexpenses:\n\n            (1) whether the parent, if still living with\n            the child, would have contributed toward the\n            costs of the requested higher education; (2)\n            the effect of the background, values and goals\n            of the parent on the reasonableness of the\n            expectation of the child for higher education;\n            (3) the amount of the contribution sought by\n            the child for the cost of higher education;\n            (4) the ability of the parent to pay that cost;\n            (5)   the   relationship   of   the   requested\n            contribution to the kind of school or course\n            of study sought by the child; (6) the\n            financial resources of both parents; (7) the\n            commitment to and aptitude of the child for\n            the requested education; (8) the financial\n            resources of the child, including assets owned\n            individually or held in custodianship or\n            trust; (9) the ability of the child to earn\n            income during the school year or on vacation;\n            (10) the availability of financial aid in the\n            form of college grants and loans; (11) the\n            child's relationship to the paying parent,\n            including mutual affection and shared goals\n            as well as responsiveness to parental advice\n            and guidance; and (12) the relationship of the\n            education requested to any prior training and\n            to the overall long-range goals of the child.\n\n            [Ibid.]\n\n    The Legislature thereafter codified factors to consider when\n\nevaluating a claim for contribution, including college expenses.\n\nSee Gotlib, supra, 399 N.J. Super. at 309 (citing N.J.S.A. 2A:34-\n\n23(a)).      Consequently,    in   determining     a   parent's    college\n\ncontribution    obligation,   \"a   trial   court   should    balance     the\n\nstatutory   criteria   of   N.J.S.A.    2A:34-23(a)    and   the   Newburgh\n\n                                   20                               A-4321-14T2\n\ffactors, as well as any other relevant circumstances, to reach a\n\nfair and just decision . . . .\"           Gac v. Gac, 186 N.J. 535, 543\n\n(2006).\n\n     Here, the trial court failed to address either the Newburgh\n\nor   the    statutory   factors   under    N.J.S.A.   2A:34-23(a).           In\n\nparticular, the court treated the incurred college debt as a\n\nliability    subject    to   equitable   distribution,   like   any     other\n\nmarital debt. This was mistaken, as the college expenses — whether\n\nprospective or incurred — should have been analyzed within the\n\nNewburgh-Gac framework.\n\n     Therefore, we are constrained to remand this portion of the\n\njudgment, for the trial court to make further findings consistent\n\nwith Newburgh, Gac, and N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(a).             See Raynor v.\n\nRaynor, 319 N.J. Super. 591, 617 (App. Div. 1999) (reversing a\n\ntrial court's college contribution obligation, where the trial\n\ncourt failed to consider the factors listed in Newburgh or the\n\nparties' financial circumstances.).         We express no opinion as to\n\nwhether this analysis should yield a different result.           However,\n\nwe note that the court did not explicitly consider the child's\n\nearning ability, and capacity to bear responsibility for some of\n\nthe borrowing.    Notably, he is pursuing a degree in a field that\n\nhas a positive job outlook.\n\n\n\n                                    21                                A-4321-14T2\n\f                                      D.\n\n     Defendant also argues the trial court erred in failing to\n\ndirect plaintiff to maintain life insurance for his benefit, as\n\nsecurity for the payment of alimony.         N.J.S.A. 2A:34-25 expressly\n\nprovides trial courts with the authority to order \"either spouse\n\nor partner to maintain life insurance for the protection of the\n\nformer spouse, partner, or the children of the marriage or civil\n\nunion in the event of the payer spouse's or partner's death.\"                 See\n\nJacobitti v. Jacobitti, 135 N.J. 571, 580 (1994); Claffey v.\n\nClaffey, 360 N.J. Super. 240, 262-63 (App. Div. 2003).                     Here,\n\ndefendant requested the court to direct plaintiff to name him as\n\na beneficiary to plaintiff's three life insurance policies.2\n\n     The trial court did not expressly address the issue of\n\nplaintiff securing her payment of alimony with life insurance.\n\nRather, the judgment of divorce only addressed whether to require\n\ndefendant   to   obtain   insurance    on   his    life,   which   the     court\n\nultimately rejected because of his age.           As the trial court failed\n\nto   consider    plaintiff's   maintenance        of   life   insurance       for\n\ndefendant's benefit, we are constrained to remand this issue for\n\n\n2\n  At trial, defendant testified that plaintiff's policies include\na workplace life insurance policy worth \"three times her yearly\nsalary,\" a AAA life insurance policy worth \"100,000 or 200,000,\"\nand an AXA life insurance policy worth \"about 200,000.\"         He\nproposed that he be named a fifty-percent beneficiary on all these\npolicies.\n\n                                  22                                     A-4321-14T2\n\ffurther consideration.   We leave it to the court's discretion to\n\ndetermine whether to direct plaintiff to maintain life insurance,\n\nand if so, the amount to be secured.\n\n                                E.\n\n     Lastly, we address defendant's argument that the trial judge\n\nabused her discretion in ordering him to pay his own counsel fees.\n\nHe claims plaintiff is in a superior financial position and he has\n\nlimited resources to afford these fees.    We find this argument\n\nwithout merit.   Trial courts have the authority to award counsel\n\nfees in a family law action under N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23 and Rule 5:3-\n\n5(c).   \"[T]he award of counsel fees in a matrimonial action is\n\ndiscretionary with the trial court and an exercise thereof will\n\nnot be disturbed in an absence of a showing of abuse.\"     Chestone\n\nv. Chestone, 322 N.J. Super. 250, 258 (App. Div. 1999).\n\n     In her written decision, the judge examined the nine factors\n\nset forth in Rule 5:3-5(c) and made specific findings as to each.\n\nNotably, in considering \"the ability of the parties to pay their\n\nown fees or to contribute to the fees of the other party,\" Rule\n\n5:3-5(c)(2), the trial court held:\n\n          In the instant matter, it appears that neither\n          of the parties have significant liquid capital\n          assets from which to satisfy their own counsel\n          fees.    The sum remaining in the Fidelity\n          investments Account has been allocated to the\n          payment of debt, but remains a resource for\n          Plaintiff.    Otherwise, Plaintiff would be\n\n                               23                           A-4321-14T2\n\f         required to again borrow against her pension,\n         having already taken a debt consolidation\n         loan.\n\n                Defendant has no liquidity.\n\n    Given our deferential standard of review and the trial court's\n\nthorough consideration of the necessary factors outlined under\n\nRule 5:3-5(c), we find no reason to interfere with the trial\n\ncourt's decision and affirm its denial of attorney's fees.\n\n                                F.\n\n    In conclusion, we affirm the court's judgment as it pertains\n\nto alimony, equitable distribution, and counsel fees; and remand\n\nfor further consideration the issues of college expenses and life\n\ninsurance.\n\n    Affirmed in part and remanded in part.

Wainer, respondent, argued the cause\n              pro se.\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n        In this appeal from a final judgment of divorce, defendant\n\nMiguel A. Wainer challenges the court's equitable distribution of\n\nmarital      assets,    the   amount    of   alimony    awarded    to   him,       the\n\fallocation   of   college   expenses,    the   failure    to   require   life\n\ninsurance as security for alimony, and the denial of counsel fees.\n\nWe affirm in part, substantially for the reasons set forth in the\n\ntrial court's thirty-nine page decision; but are constrained to\n\nremand in part for a more complete statement of reasons for the\n\ncourt's order regarding college expenses and for an explicit\n\ndetermination regarding life insurance.\n\n                                    I.\n\n     After   twenty-five    years   of   marriage,   plaintiff     Daryl    B.\n\nWainer filed for divorce in December 2013.               The parties' only\n\nchild was then a student at a private university.              Plaintiff was\n\nfifty-six years old and still active in the workplace.             Defendant\n\nwas seventy-nine    years old and retired.           Plaintiff earned a\n\nstipulated annual income of $92,419 and defendant received almost\n\n$13,000 a year in Social Security benefits.              After a four-day\n\ntrial conducted in late 2014 and early 2015, at which the parties\n\nwere the sole witnesses, the trial court awarded defendant open\n\ndurational alimony of $27,500 a year.\n\n     As for equitable distribution, the court allocated to each\n\nparty equal shares of: the parties' personal property; a Fidelity\n\ninvestment account, which the court valued at $78,249; plaintiff's\n\npension, valued at $122,965 and to be distributed pursuant to a\n\nqualified domestic relations order; and the plaintiff's marital\n\n                                    2                                A-4321-14T2\n\fcredit card debt of $25,000.      Regarding an apartment in Buenos\n\nAires that the parties beneficially owned, the court directed the\n\nparties to sell the property within two years, with defendant\n\nreceiving sixty-five percent of the net proceeds and plaintiff\n\nthirty-five percent.    Neither party presented an appraisal of the\n\napartment's value, although defendant opined that it was worth\n\n$350,000, but would be more marketable within two years after\n\ntrial, with an anticipated change in economic policy in Argentina.\n\n     The judge directed the parties to share equally in the payment\n\nof the roughly $34,000 in college loans for the parties' child,\n\nwhich were in plaintiff's name.    The court also required defendant\n\nto pay forty percent of their child's senior year college costs\n\nand other child-related expenses.        The court ordered plaintiff to\n\nretain defendant's share of the Fidelity account, $39,124.50, in\n\nsatisfaction of these obligations and his share of the marital\n\ncredit card debt.\n\n     Finally,   the    court   ordered     that   both   parties    remain\n\nresponsible for their own attorney's fees and costs.           The court\n\ndid not address whether plaintiff was required to maintain life\n\ninsurance to secure the payment of alimony to defendant.\n\n     In his appeal, defendant raises the following points:\n\n\n\n\n                                   3                               A-4321-14T2\n\f            POINT I\n\n            THE FINAL JUDGMENT OF DIVORCE RESTS ON\n            INSUFFICIENT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE IN THE TRIAL\n            RECORD AND INFRINGES CONTROLLING NEW JERSEY\n            LAW.\n\n                 A.

In any event, the testimony at\n\ntrial was that the apartment was titled in the name of plaintiff's\n\nbrother, with the parties' consent.

Indeed, the\n\nFidelity    account   was   initially   funded    with   $200,000   from    an\n\notherwise exempt gift to plaintiff from her family.

We shall not disturb the court's\n\ntreatment of the Fidelity account as a marital asset.\n\n     Defendant   also   challenges       the   allocation   of   plaintiff's\n\ncredit card debt of $25,000, which she testified was incurred to\n\ncover marital expenses.   He contends the debt was incurred against\n\nhis advice, and the court disregarded his own significant debt.\n\nThe judge stated:\n\n               There is no justification to relieve\n          Defendant from liability for fifty percent\n          (50%) of the parties' marital debt.        The\n          parties have historically used credit cards\n          to fund any shortfall in their monthly living\n          expenditures. It was Defendant who maintained\n          the parties' finances until a few short months\n          before the commencement of trial. Therefore,\n          it is disingenuous for Defendant to claim he\n          was   unaware  of   the   parties'   financial\n          circumstances.\n\n                                     9                               A-4321-14T2\n\fSimply put, there was sufficient credible evidence, consisting of\n\nplaintiff's testimony, that the credit card debt was attributable\n\nto reasonable marital expenses.       Defendant presented no competent\n\ndocumentary evidence to establish the amounts were unreasonable,\n\nor unrelated to marital expenses.\n\n     As   for   his   claim   that   the   judge   disregarded   his   own\n\nsignificant debt, we recognize that he reported, in his December\n\n2014 case information statement, $7000 in his own credit card\n\ndebt, as well as an additional $13,000 owed to a bank.           However,\n\nthe record before us does not illuminate when, and for what, that\n\ndebt was incurred.     Notably, defendant introduced into evidence\n\nan extensive summary of his debt, with multiple attachments.\n\nPlaintiff, as well, introduced documentary evidence of defendant's\n\ncredit cards, because she made payments on the accounts.         However,\n\nsince defendant omitted those exhibits from the appendix on appeal,\n\nwe find no reason to disturb the court's ruling on this issue.\n\nSee Cmty. Hosp. Grp., Inc. v.

From 1990 to 2005, the parties resided in\n\nArgentina, living in aparthotels and rental properties, before\n\npurchasing the apartment in Buenos Aires in 2000.                 While in\n\nArgentina,   defendant    invested     in   a   bicycle   business,     which\n\ndissolved less than a year later.           The parties soon thereafter\n\nopened a private language school, with plaintiff responsible for\n\nteaching and developing the curriculum, and defendant handling the\n\nmarketing and finances.      However, the parties later returned to\n\nNew Jersey in 2005, during the financial crisis in Argentina.\n\n     After returning to New Jersey, plaintiff served as the primary\n\nbreadwinner for the family. At the time of trial, she was employed\n\nby a public school district, earning a stipulated gross annual\n\nincome of $92,419.       In addition to working full-time, she was\n\n\n                                  13                                  A-4321-14T2\n\fpursuing a doctoral degree in education (Ed.D.).      To support her\n\nown     educational   endeavors,   she   had   borrowed   $61,000    in\n\nunsubsidized student loans.\n\n      Defendant, on the other hand, has not experienced the same\n\nsuccess since returning to the United States.         For a time, he\n\nearned modest commissions as a life insurance agent, but that\n\nsource of income dried up.     At the time of trial, he was almost\n\neighty years old, retired, and collecting approximately $13,000\n\nin annual Social Security benefits.1\n\n      In determining plaintiff's alimony obligation, the trial\n\ncourt examined each of the statutory factors outlined in N.J.S.A.\n\n2A:34-23(b).    Although defendant challenges the court's findings\n\nas to several of these factors, we are satisfied, based on our\n\nthorough review of the record, that the court's findings were\n\nsupported by \"adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\"      Cesare,\n\nsupra, 154 N.J. at 412.\n\n      After considering each factor, the court set plaintiff's open\n\ndurational alimony obligation at a fixed amount of $27,500 per\n\nyear.    Notably, in determining plaintiff's alimony obligation, the\n\n\n\n\n1\n Defendant's newly minted claim, in his appellate brief, that his\nbenefits are actually $11,616 lacks any support in the record and\nis at odds with defendant's own CIS and trial testimony.\n\n                                   14                         A-4321-14T2\n\ftrial   court   considered   both   party's   individual   budgets   and\n\ncombined net incomes:\n\n                Plaintiff earns gross wages of $92,419.00\n           and Defendant social security wages of\n           $13,000.00.    These sum nets cannot cover\n           either of the parties' budgets, let alone both\n           of their budgets. The point being, that even\n           while together, their funds were insufficient\n           to meet their living expenses; hence the\n           $25,000 in credit card debt used to supplement\n           living expenses.\n\n                 . . . .\n\n                The   Court  clearly   recognizes   that\n           Plaintiff, upon conference of her doctoral\n           degree, has the potential to increase her\n           earnings and can only surmise that it is the\n           eventuality of the situation. However, that\n           situation does not exist today and the Court\n           cannot determine an alimony award based upon\n           predictions of future earnings, which may\n           never materialize. Plaintiff's current income\n           must be used and that income is $92,419.00.\n\n                The   Court  further   recognizes   that\n           Defendant is at a distinct age disadvantage\n           and is entitled to retire at age eighty (80),\n           albeit a healthy 80.         Therefore, the\n           likelihood of any appreciable increase over\n           and above his social security earning is\n           negligible.\n\n                 . . . .\n\n                The fact is that neither party will be\n           able to maintain the formal marital lifestyle.\n           Using Plaintiff's current budget of $8,274.00\n           and Defendant's current budget of $5,294.00,\n           the Court finds that Plaintiff shall pay to\n           Defendant    open   durational    alimony   of\n           $27,500.00 per year.\n\n\n                                    15                          A-4321-14T2\n\f     Defendant misplaces reliance on Guglielmo v.

In Guglielmo, we explained:\n\n          Where a family's expenditures and income had\n          been consistently expanding, the dependent\n          spouse should not be confined to the precise\n          lifestyle enjoyed during the parties' last\n          year together.    Defendant's income picture\n          should be viewed with an eye toward the\n          future, since it was to this potential that\n          both parties contributed during the marriage.\n\n          [Ibid.]\n\n     Here, the record fails to demonstrate that plaintiff's income\n\nhas been consistently expanding.        Plaintiff testified to nothing\n\nmore than her hope that acquiring a doctorate would boost her\n\nincome.    There    was   no   evidence   suggesting   that    she     would\n\nautomatically qualify for a promotion or raise.               As such, we\n\ndiscern no error in the court's decision to utilize plaintiff's\n\ncurrent   income    in    determining      her   alimony      obligation.\n\nAdditionally, should plaintiff experience a significant increase\n\nin pay after receiving her Ed.D., defendant can seek a modification\n\nof alimony based on changed circumstances.

R. 2:11-\n\n3(e)(1)(E).   We add that defendant's reliance on marital fault is\n\nmisdirected, as marital fault is generally irrelevant and the\n\nrecord is bereft of any evidence establishing exceptional fault\n\nof the kind sufficient to impact alimony.

Defendant contended he lacked the\n\nability to pay.   He also argued that he opposed plaintiff's and\n\nhis child's choice of an out-of-state private university; instead,\n\nhe favored his child's attendance at City University of New York,\n\n\n\n                                17                         A-4321-14T2\n\fwhere the child could have lived at home and, he argued, reduced\n\ntotal educational costs.\n\n     Although attending an out-of-state private university, the\n\nchild   received   substantial      scholarships     that   covered   all   but\n\n$22,000 of freshman year expenses, and $12,000 of sophomore year\n\nexpenses. Plaintiff borrowed $34,000 to cover the remaining costs.\n\nShe anticipated utilizing a college savings fund for junior year\n\nshortfalls and borrowing again to finance senior year expenses.\n\nPayments on the loans were deferred.\n\n     Plaintiff also testified that the parties' child had a work-\n\nstudy   job,    which   generated    income   used    to    cover   incidental\n\nexpenses.      She also stated that the child remained out-of-state\n\nthe previous summer, having secured a paid summer internship.\n\nHowever, she did not provide detailed evidence of the costs of\n\nsupporting the child, outside the college expenses.\n\n     In allocating half of the $34,000 debt, the court stated:\n\n                 The   Court  further  finds   that  the\n            Defendant shall share equally in the payment\n            of [the child's] school loans incurred to\n            date.

The accounts have an\n            approximate value of $15,000.00.

In\n\nparticular, the court treated the incurred college debt as a\n\nliability    subject    to   equitable   distribution,   like   any     other\n\nmarital debt. This was mistaken, as the college expenses — whether\n\nprospective or incurred — should have been analyzed within the\n\nNewburgh-Gac framework.\n\n     Therefore, we are constrained to remand this portion of the\n\njudgment, for the trial court to make further findings consistent\n\nwith Newburgh, Gac, and N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(a).

We express no opinion as to\n\nwhether this analysis should yield a different result.           However,\n\nwe note that the court did not explicitly consider the child's\n\nearning ability, and capacity to bear responsibility for some of\n\nthe borrowing.

N.J.S.A. 2A:34-25 expressly\n\nprovides trial courts with the authority to order \"either spouse\n\nor partner to maintain life insurance for the protection of the\n\nformer spouse, partner, or the children of the marriage or civil\n\nunion in the event of the payer spouse's or partner's death.\"                 See\n\nJacobitti v.

Here,\n\ndefendant requested the court to direct plaintiff to name him as\n\na beneficiary to plaintiff's three life insurance policies.2\n\n     The trial court did not expressly address the issue of\n\nplaintiff securing her payment of alimony with life insurance.\n\nRather, the judgment of divorce only addressed whether to require\n\ndefendant   to   obtain   insurance    on   his    life,   which   the     court\n\nultimately rejected because of his age.           As the trial court failed\n\nto   consider    plaintiff's   maintenance        of   life   insurance       for\n\ndefendant's benefit, we are constrained to remand this issue for\n\n\n2\n  At trial, defendant testified that plaintiff's policies include\na workplace life insurance policy worth \"three times her yearly\nsalary,\" a AAA life insurance policy worth \"100,000 or 200,000,\"\nand an AXA life insurance policy worth \"about 200,000.\"         He\nproposed that he be named a fifty-percent beneficiary on all these\npolicies.\n\n                                  22                                     A-4321-14T2\n\ffurther consideration.

We find this argument\n\nwithout merit.   Trial courts have the authority to award counsel\n\nfees in a family law action under N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23 and Rule 5:3-\n\n5(c).   \"[T]he award of counsel fees in a matrimonial action is\n\ndiscretionary with the trial court and an exercise thereof will\n\nnot be disturbed in an absence of a showing of abuse.\"     Chestone\n\nv.
