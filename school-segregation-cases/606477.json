Brown Univ.,  809 F.  Supp. 978 (D.R.I.  1992).   After\n                     \n\nmapping  Title IX's rugged  legal terrain and  cutting a passable\n\nswath through  the factual thicket that  overspreads the parties'\n\narguments, we affirm.\n\nI.  BROWN ATHLETICS:  AN OVERVIEW\n\n          College  athletics,   particularly  in  the   realm  of\n\nfootball and basketball,  has traditionally occupied  a prominent\n\nrole  in  American  sports  and American  society.    For college\n\nstudents, athletics offers an  opportunity to exacuate leadership\n\nskills, learn teamwork, build  self-confidence, and perfect self-\n\ndiscipline.    In addition,  for many  student-athletes, physical\n\nskills  are a  passport to  college admissions  and scholarships,\n\nallowing them  to attend  otherwise inaccessible schools.   These\n\nopportunities, and the lessons learned on the playing fields, are\n\ninvaluable in attaining career  and life successes in and  out of\n\nprofessional sports.\n\n          The  highway of  opportunity runs  in both  directions.\n\n                    \n\n     1The individual defendants are, respectively,  the President\nand  Athletic Director of  the University.   Each is  sued in his\nofficial capacity.  For ease in reference, we discuss this appeal\nas if Brown was  the sole defendant and appellant.   Nonetheless,\nour opinion applies equally to all parties.\n\n                                2\n\nNot only  student-athletes, but  universities, too,  benefit from\n\nthe magic  of intercollegiate sports.   Successful teams generate\n\ntelevision   revenues   and  gate   receipts  which   often  fund\n\nsignificant   percentages  of  a  university's  overall  athletic\n\nprogram, offering  students the opportunity to  partake of sports\n\nthat   are   not  financially   self-sustaining.     Even   those\n\ninstitutions whose teams do not fill the grandstands of cavernous\n\nstadiums  or attract  national television  exposure benefit  from\n\nincreased  student  and  alumni   cohesion  and  the  support  it\n\nengenders.   Thus,  universities  nurture the  legends, great  or\n\nsmall, inhering  in their  athletic past, polishing  the hardware\n\nthat adorns field-house trophy cases and reliving heroic exploits\n\nin the pages of alumni magazines.\n\n          In these terms, Brown will never be confused with Notre\n\nDame or the  more muscular members of the Big  Ten.  Although its\n\nfootball  team did  play  in the  1916 Rose  Bowl  and its  men's\n\nbasketball  team won the  Ivy League championship  as recently as\n\n1986, Brown's  athletic  program has  only occasionally  achieved\n\nnational  prominence  or,  for  that  matter,  enjoyed  sustained\n\nsuccess.2  Moreover,  at Brown, as  at most schools, women  are a\n\nrelatively  inconspicuous part  of  the  storied  athletic  past.\n\nHistorically,  colleges limited  athletics  to  the male  sphere,\n\nleaving  those few women's  teams that  sprouted to  scrounge for\n\nresources.\n\n                    \n\n     2We note, not without a certain irony, that  the now-demoted\nwomen's   volleyball  and   gymnastics   teams  won   Ivy  League\nchampionships in 1988 and 1990, respectively.\n\n                                3\n\n          The absence  of women's  athletics at Brown  was, until\n\n1970, an ineluctable  consequence of the absence  of women; Brown\n\nsponsored a women's college   Pembroke   but did not itself admit\n\nwomen.    In 1971,  Brown  subsumed  Pembroke.    Brown  promptly\n\nupgraded Pembroke's  rather primitive athletic  offerings so that\n\nby 1977 there were fourteen women's varsity teams.  In subsequent\n\nyears, Brown  added only one distaff team:  winter track.  Hence,\n\nin  the  1991-92 academic  year,  Brown  fielded fifteen  women's\n\nvarsity teams   one fewer than the number of men's varsity teams.\n\nII.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS\n\n          In the  spring of 1991,  Brown announced that  it, like\n\nmany other schools, was in a financial bind, and that, as a belt-\n\ntightening  measure,  it planned  to  drop four  sports  from its\n\nintercollegiate varsity  athletic roster:  women's volleyball and\n\ngymnastics, men's  golf and water polo.  The University permitted\n\nthe  teams  to continue  playing  as  \"intercollegiate clubs,\"  a\n\nstatus  that allowed them  to compete against  varsity teams from\n\nother  colleges,3 but  cut  off financial  subsidies and  support\n\nservices  routinely available  to  varsity teams  (e.g., salaried\n                                                       \n\ncoaches, access  to prime  facilities,  preferred practice  time,\n\nmedical trainers, clerical  assistance, office support, admission\n\npreferences,  and the  like).   Brown estimated  that eliminating\n\n                    \n\n     3As a practical matter, many schools with varsity squads are\nreluctant  to  compete  against  club teams.    This  case  aptly\nillustrates  the point.   As  soon as  Brown demoted  its women's\nvolleyball  team  from  varsity   to  club  status,  Northeastern\nUniversity and  West Point  declined to include  Brown on  future\nvolleyball schedules.  See Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 993.\n                                \n\n                                4\n\nthese  four varsity  teams would save  $77,813 per  annum, broken\n\ndown   as  follows:     women's   volleyball,  $37,127;   women's\n\ngymnastics,  $24,901;  men's  water  polo,  $9,250;  men's  golf,\n\n$6,545.\n\n          Before the  cuts, Brown athletics  offered an aggregate\n\nof  328 varsity slots for  female athletes and  566 varsity slots\n\nfor  male  athletes.   Thus,  women  had  36.7%  of the  athletic\n\nopportunities and men  63.3%.  Abolishing the four  varsity teams\n\ntook substantially more dollars  from the women's athletic budget\n\nthan from the  men's budget,  but did not  materially affect  the\n\nathletic   opportunity  ratios;  women   retained  36.6%  of  the\n\nopportunities and men  63.4%.  At that time (and  for a number of\n\nyears    prior   thereto),   Brown's   student   body   comprised\n\napproximately 52% men and 48% women.\n\n          Following   Brown's   announcement  of   the  cutbacks,\n\ndisappointed  members of  the women's  volleyball and  gymnastics\n\nteams brought suit.  They proceeded on an implied cause of action\n\nunder Title IX, 20 U.S.C.     1681-1688 (1988).  See  Franklin v.\n                                                              \n\nGwinnett  County  Pub.  Sch.,  112  S.  Ct.  1028,  1032   (1992)\n                            \n\n(recognizing  implied private  right of  action under  Title IX);\n\nCannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 717 (1979) (same);\n                               \n\nsee also Cannon, 441 U.S. at 687  n.8 (holding that exhaustion of\n               \n\nadministrative remedies  is  not a  prerequisite  to a  Title  IX\n\nsuit).  The plaintiffs charged that Brown's athletic arrangements\n\nviolated  Title  IX's  ban  on  gender-based   discrimination,  a\n\nviolation that  was allegedly exacerbated by  Brown's decision to\n\n                                5\n\ndevalue the two women's  programs without first making sufficient\n\nreductions  in men's  activities or,  in the  alternative, adding\n\nother women's teams to compensate for the loss.\n\n          On plaintiffs'  motion, the district  court certified a\n\nclass of  \"all present and future Brown University women students\n\nand  potential  students  who participate,  seek  to participate,\n\nand/or   are  deterred  from   participating  in  intercollegiate\n\nathletics  funded by Brown.\"  And, after hearing fourteen days of\n\ntestimony from twenty witnesses,  the judge granted a preliminary\n\ninjunction  requiring Brown  to reinstate  the two  women's teams\n\npending the  outcome of a full  trial on the merits.   See Cohen,\n                                                                \n\n809  F. Supp.  at 1001.   We  stayed execution  of the  order and\n\nexpedited Brown's appeal.\n\nIII.  TITLE IX AND COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS\n\n          Title  IX  prohibits  gender-based   discrimination  by\n\neducational institutions receiving federal financial support   in\n\npractice,  the  vast  majority  of all  accredited  colleges  and\n\nuniversities.   The statute  sketches wide policy  lines, leaving\n\nthe details  to regulating agencies.   Since this  appeal demands\n\nthat  we  invade  terra  incognita,4  we  carefully  recount  the\n                                  \n\n                    \n\n     4Although there has been a  spate of sports-related Title IX\nsuits  during the last two  years, see Andrew  Blum, Athletics in\n                                                                 \nthe  Courts, Nat'l L.J., Apr. 5, 1993,  at 1, few have been fully\n           \nlitigated.    See, e.g.,  Carol Herwig,  Massachusetts Reinstates\n                                                                 \nWomen's  Sports, USA  Today, Oct.  22, 1992,  at 14C  (announcing\n               \nagreement to reinstate three  women's teams at the  University of\nMassachusetts and reporting the school's intention to become \"the\nfirst university in the country to come into full compliance with\nTitle IX\").   While  the case we  decide today is  apparently the\n\n                                6\n\ndevelopments  leading to the present version of Title IX and then\n\nexamine the pertinent statutory and regulatory language.\n\n                      A.  Scope of Title IX.\n                                           \n\n          At its  inception, the broad  proscriptive language  of\n\nTitle IX caused considerable consternation in the academic world.\n\nThe academy's anxiety chiefly  centered around identifying  which\n\nindividual programs,  particularly in  terms of  athletics, might\n\ncome  within  the scope  of  the  discrimination provision,  and,\n\nrelatedly, how  the government  would determine compliance.   The\n\ngridiron  fueled these  concerns:   for many  schools, the  men's\n\nfootball budget far exceeded  that of any other sport,  and men's\n\nathletics  as  a whole  received  the lion's  share  of dedicated\n\nresources   a share  that, typically, was vastly disproportionate\n\nto the percentage of men in the student body.\n\n          Part of the  confusion about  the scope  of Title  IX's\n\ncoverage  and the acceptable avenues of compliance arose from the\n\nabsence of secondary legislative materials.  Congress included no\n\ncommittee report with  the final bill  and there were  apparently\n\nonly   two  mentions  of  intercollegiate  athletics  during  the\n\ncongressional debate.  See 118 Cong. Rec. 5,807 (1972) (statement\n                          \n\nof Sen. Bayh on  privacy in athletic facilities); 117  Cong. Rec.\n\n30,407 (1971) (statement of Sen. Bayh noting  that proposed Title\n\n                    \n\nfirst  of  these  to reach  the  courts  of  appeals, others  are\npending.  See, e.g., Roberts v. Colorado State Univ., No. 93-1052\n                                                    \n(10th Cir. 1993) (not yet argued); Cook v. Colgate Univ., No. 92-\n                                                        \n9175 (2d Cir. 1993) (argued Feb. 26, 1993).\n\n                                7\n\nIX   will   not    require   gender-blended   football    teams).\n\nNevertheless,  under congressional  direction to  implement Title\n\nIX,  the  Secretary  of   Health,  Education  and  Welfare  (HEW)\n\npromulgated   regulations   in  1975   which   included  specific\n\nprovisions for college athletics.  Four years later, HEW's Office\n\nof Civil  Rights (OCR) added another layer of regulatory exegesis\n\nwhen,  after   notice  and   comment,  it  published   a  \"Policy\n\nInterpretation\"  that offered  a more  detailed measure  of equal\n\nathletic opportunity.\n\n          In  1984,  the  Supreme  Court  radically  altered  the\n\ncontemporary reading of Title  IX.  The Court held that  Title IX\n\nwas \"program-specific,\"  so that its  tenets applied only  to the\n\nprogram(s)  which actually received federal  funds and not to the\n\nrest  of the university.   Grove City  College v.  Bell, 465 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n555,  574 (1984).   Because  few athletic departments  are direct\n\nrecipients of federal funds   most federal money for universities\n\nis channelled through financial  aid offices or invested directly\n\nin  research  grants    Grove City  cabined  Title IX  and placed\n                                  \n\nvirtually all collegiate athletic programs beyond its reach.5\n\n          In  response  to  Grove  City,  Congress  scrapped  the\n                                       \n\nprogram-specific  approach  and  reinstated  an  institution-wide\n\napplication  of Title IX by  passing the Civil Rights Restoration\n\n                    \n\n     5Following the  Court's decision  in Grove City,  the United\n                                                    \nStates Department of Education  (which by then had been  spun off\nfrom HEW, see  infra Part III(C))  dropped or curtailed  seventy-\n                    \nnine  ongoing Title  IX cases.   See  Statements on  Civil Rights\n                                                                 \nRestoration  Act, Daily Lab. Rep.

No.  64, 100th Cong.,\n                                   \n\n2d  Sess.  4  (1988),  reprinted   in  1988  U.S.C.C.A.N.  3,   6\n                                     \n\n(explaining  that  Congress  wanted  to  prohibit  discrimination\n\nthroughout an institution if the institution received any federal\n\nfunds).    Although the  Restoration  Act  does not  specifically\n\nmention  sports, the  record of  the floor  debate leaves  little\n\ndoubt that the enactment was aimed,  in part, at creating a  more\n\nlevel  playing field for female  athletes.  See,  e.g., 130 Cong.\n                                                      \n\nRec. S12,642 (daily  ed. Oct.  2, 1984) (statement  of Sen.  Byrd\n\ndecrying  past discrimination against female athletes); 130 Cong.\n\nRec.  S11,253 (daily ed. Sept. 17, 1984) (statement of Sen. Hatch\n\nregarding importance of Title IX to ensuring development of women\n\nathletes);  130  Cong.  Rec.  S2,267  (daily ed.  Mar.  2,  1984)\n\n(statement  of  Sen.  Riegle  noting extensive  evidence  of  sex\n\ndiscrimination in education and athletics).\n\n          The appellants  do not challenge  the district  court's\n\nfinding that, under existing  law, Brown's athletic department is\n\nsubject to Title  IX.   Accordingly, we devote  the remainder  of\n\nPart III to deterrating the meaning of Title IX, looking first at\n\nthe statute and then at the regulations.\n\n                     B.  Statutory Framework.\n                                            \n\n          Title IX, like the Restoration Act, does not explicitly\n\n                                9\n\ntreat  college  athletics.6   Rather,  the statute's  heart  is a\n\nbroad  prohibition   of   gender-based  discrimination   in   all\n\nprogrammatic aspects of educational institutions:\n\n               No person in the United States shall, on\n          the   basis   of   sex,  be   excluded   from\n          participation in, be denied the  benefits of,\n          or be subjected  to discrimination under  any\n          education   program  or   activity  receiving\n          Federal financial assistance . . . .\n\n20 U.S.C.    1681(a) (1988).   After listing  a number of  exempt\n\norganizations,  section 1681  makes  clear that,  while Title  IX\n\nprohibits  discrimination, it  does not mandate  strict numerical\n\nequality  between  the gender  balance  of  a college's  athletic\n\nprogram  and the  gender  balance of  its  student body.    Thus,\n\nsection 1681(a) shall not\n\n          be  interpreted  to  require any  educational\n          institution   to    grant   preferential   or\n          disparate treatment to the members of one sex\n          on account  of an  imbalance which  may exist\n          with  respect   to   the  total   number   or\n          percentage   of   persons    of   that    sex\n          participating in or receiving the benefits of\n          any federally supported program  or activity,\n          in   comparison  with  the  total  number  or\n          percentage of  persons  of that  sex  in  any\n          community,  State,  section,  or other  area:\n          Provided, That this  subsection shall not  be\n                  \n          construed to prevent the consideration in any\n          hearing  or proceeding under  this chapter of\n          statistical  evidence  tending  to show  that\n          such an  imbalance exists with respect to the\n          participation in, or receipt of  the benefits\n          of,  any  such  program or  activity  by  the\n          members of one sex.\n\n                    \n\n     6This lacuna apparently results from a political compromise.\nAfter the Conference Committee  deleted an amendment to  Title IX\nthat would have  exempted \"revenue-producing\" athletics, Congress\nasked the  Secretary of  HEW to provide  regulations specifically\ngoverning athletics.  See 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (1979).\n                         \n\n                                10\n\n20 U.S.C.    1681(b) (1988).  Put another  way, a court assessing\n\nTitle IX compliance may not find a violation solely because there\n                                                   \n\nis  a disparity between the gender  composition of an educational\n\ninstitution's  student constituency,  on  the one  hand, and  its\n\nathletic programs, on the other hand.\n\n          That  is not to say,  however, that evidence  of such a\n\ndisparity  is irrelevant.  Quite the contrary:  under the proviso\n\ncontained in section 1681(b), a Title IX plaintiff in an athletic\n\ndiscrimination  suit  must   accompany  statistical  evidence  of\n\ndisparate impact with  some further  evidence of  discrimination,\n\nsuch as unmet needamongst the members of thedisadvantaged gender.\n\n                    C.  Regulatory Framework.\n                                            \n\n          As we mentioned above,  the Secretary of HEW, following\n\nCongress's  instructions,  promulgated  regulations  implementing\n\nTitle IX  in the  pre-Grove City  era.  See  40 Fed.  Reg. 24,128\n                                           \n\n(1975).    Thereafter,  in  1979,  Congress split  HEW  into  the\n\nDepartment  of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department\n\nof Education  (DED).  See  20 U.S.C.     3401-3510 (1988).   In a\n                         \n\nwonderful example  of bureaucratic muddle, the  existing Title IX\n\nregulations were  left within  HHS's arsenal  while, at  the same\n\ntime,  DED  replicated  them  as  part  of  its   own  regulatory\n\narmamentarium.   Compare 45 C.F.R.    86 (1992) (HHS regulations)\n                        \n\nwith 34  C.F.R.    106 (1992) (DED  regulations).   Both sets  of\n    \n\nregulations were still in effect when the Restoration Act passed.\n\nThey  are  identical,  save  only  for  changes  in  nomenclature\n\nreflecting the reorganization of the federal bureaucracy.\n\n                                11\n\n          In short, like pretenders to the emirate of a  deceased\n\nsheik, both HHS  and DED  lay an hereditary  claim to this  oasis\n\nwhich arises  from the regulatory desert,  asserting authority to\n\nenforce  Title IX.  Nevertheless,  DED is the  principle locus of\n\nongoing  enforcement  activity.    See  20  U.S.C.     3441(a)(1)\n                                      \n\n(transferring all education functions of HEW to DED); see also 20\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   3441(a)(3) (transferring  education-related OCR work  to\n\nDED).   Therefore, like the parties, we treat DED, acting through\n\nits OCR, as the  administrative agency charged with administering\n\nTitle IX.7\n\n          Recognizing  the agency's role  has important practical\n\nand legal  consequences.   Although DED is  not a  party to  this\n\nappeal, we must accord its interpretation of Title IX appreciable\n\ndeference.  See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.  Natural Resources Defense\n                                                                 \n\nCouncil,  Inc., 467  U.S.  837, 844  (1984);  see also  Udall  v.\n                                                             \n\nTallman, 380 U.S.  1, 16  (1965) (noting that  the Supreme  Court\n       \n\n\"gives great deference to the interpretation given the statute by\n\nthe officers  or agency charged  with its administration\").   The\n\ndegree  of deference  is  particularly  high  in Title  IX  cases\n\nbecause Congress explicitly  delegated to the agency  the task of\n\nprescribing standards for athletic programs under Title IX.   See\n                                                                 \n\nPub. L.

The  Regulations.   DED's  regulations  begin  by\n          1.    The  Regulations.\n                                \n\ndetailing  Title IX's  application  to college  athletics.8   The\n\nregulations also recognize, however, that an athletic program may\n\nconsist  of  gender-segregated  teams  as  long  as  one  of  two\n\nconditions is met:  either the  sport in which the team  competes\n\nis  a contact sport or the institution offers comparable teams in\n\nthe sport to both genders.  See 34 C.F.R.   106.41(b).\n                               \n\n          Finally, whether  teams are  segregated by sex  or not,\n\nthe school  must provide gender-blind equality  of opportunity to\n\nits  student  body.     The  regulations  offer  a  non-exclusive\n\ncompendium of ten  factors which OCR  will consider in  assessing\n\ncompliance with this mandate:\n\n               (1) Whether the  selection of sports and\n          levels of competition effectively accommodate\n          the  interests  and abilities  of  members of\n\n                    \n\n     8The regulations provide:\n\n          No  person shall,  on  the basis  of sex,  be\n          excluded from participation in, be denied the\n          benefits  of,  be  treated  differently  from\n          another person or otherwise  be discriminated\n          against      in      any     interscholastic,\n          intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics\n          offered  by  a  recipient,  and  no recipient\n          shall provide any  such athletics  separately\n          on such basis.\n\n34 C.F.R.   106.41(a) (1992).\n\n                                13\n\n          both sexes;\n               (2)  The  provision  of   equipment  and\n          supplies;\n               (3)  Scheduling  of  games and  practice\n          time;\n               (4) Travel and per diem allowance;\n               (5) Opportunity to receive  coaching and\n          academic tutoring;\n               (6)   Assignment  and   compensation  of\n          coaches and tutors;\n               (7) Provision of locker  rooms, practice\n          and competitive facilities;\n               (8)  Provision  of medical  and training\n          facilities and services;\n               (9)  Provision  of  housing  and  dining\n          facilities and services;\n               (10) Publicity.\n\n34 C.F.R.    106.41(c) (1992).9   The district  court rested  its\n\npreliminary  injunction  on  the  first of  these  ten  areas  of\n\ninquiry:     Brown's  failure  effectively   to  accommodate  the\n\ninterests  and abilities of female  students in the selection and\n\nlevel of sports.   See Cohen, 809 F.  Supp. at 994.  Hence,  this\n                            \n\narea  is the  most critical  in terms  of evaluating  the charges\n\nagainst  Brown  (although  it  is  also  the  most  difficult  to\n\nmeasure).\n\n          2.  The Policy Interpretation.  In the three years next\n          2.  The Policy Interpretation.\n                                       \n\nfollowing the  initial issuance of the  regulations, HEW received\n\n                    \n\n     9The same regulation also stipulates that:\n\n          Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of\n          each sex or unequal expenditures for male and\n          female  teams  if  a  recipient  operates  or\n          sponsors separate teams  will not  constitute\n          noncompliance  with  this section,  but [DED]\n          may consider the failure to provide necessary\n          funds  for  teams  for one  sex  in assessing\n          equality of opportunity  for members of  each\n          sex.\n\n34 C.F.R.   106.41(c) (1992).\n\n                                14\n\nover one  hundred discrimination  complaints involving  more than\n\nfifty schools.   In order to encourage  self-policing and thereby\n\nwinnow complaints, HEW proposed a Policy Interpretation.   See 43\n                                                              \n\nFed.  Reg.  58,070  (1978).    It  then  promulgated  the  Policy\n\nInterpretation in final form,  see 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413  (1979), a\n                                  \n\nmatter of months before the effective date of the statute through\n\nwhich Congress, emulating King  Solomon, split HEW.   The parties\n\nare in agreement  that, at  DED's birth, it  clutched the  Policy\n\nInterpretation, and,  as a practical  matter, that appears  to be\n\nthe case.10   See, e.g., DED,  Title IX Athletics  Investigator's\n                                                                 \n\nManual  1, 2  (1990)  (Manual); see  also  Complaint Letter  from\n                                         \n\nRegional Civil  Rights Director,  DED, to Dr.  Martin Massengale,\n\nChancellor, Univ. of  Nebraska (July 10,  1989) (noting that  DED\n\n\"ha[s]   followed   the   directions  provided   in   the  Policy\n\nInterpretation\");  Complaint Letter  from  Regional Civil  Rights\n\nDirector, DED, to  Dr. Charles  A. Walker,  Chancellor, Univ.  of\n\nArkansas (Sept. 1, 1989) (same).  Although we can  find no record\n\nthat DED  formally adopted the  Policy Interpretation, we  see no\n\npoint to splitting the hair, particularly where the parties  have\n\nnot  asked us to  do so.   Because this document  is a considered\n\ninterpretation  of  the  regulation,   we  cede  it   substantial\n\ndeference.  See Martin v. OSHRC, 111 S. Ct. 1171, 1175-76 (1991);\n                               \n\n                    \n\n     10Congress  clearly  assigned  HEW's  regulatory  duties  in\neducation to the nascent DED.   See 20 U.S.C.   3441.   Moreover,\n                                   \nin taking up its mantle, DED adopted exactly the regulation which\nthe  Policy Interpretation  purported to  interpret    sending an\nunmistakably clear  signal of the agency's  satisfaction with the\nPolicy Interpretation.\n\n                                15\n\nGardebring v.

In  surveying  the dimensions  of this\n\nbattleground, that  is, whether an  athletic program  effectively\n\naccommodates   students'  interests  and  abilities,  the  Policy\n\nInterpretation  maps   a  trinitarian   model  under  which   the\n\nuniversity must meet at least one of three benchmarks:\n\n               (1)   Whether   intercollegiate    level\n          participation  opportunities   for  male  and\n          female  students  are  provided   in  numbers\n          substantially    proportionate    to    their\n          respective enrollments; or\n               (2) Where  the members  of one  sex have\n          been    and   are    underrepresented   among\n          intercollegiate    athletes,   whether    the\n          institution can show a history and continuing\n          practice  of  program   expansion  which   is\n          demonstrably  responsive  to  the  developing\n\n                    \n\n     12In any  event, both the financial  assistance and athletic\nequivalence standards are inapposite for present purposes.  As to\nthe former,  Brown does not confer athletic  scholarships and the\nplaintiffs do not allege  that Brown has discriminated by  gender\nin  distributing  other financial  aid.   As  to the  latter, the\ndistrict court made only preliminary findings,  see Cohen, 809 F.\n                                                         \nSupp.  at 994-97,  on  the explicit  understanding that  it would\nrevisit compliance vel non with the athletic equivalence standard\n                          \nat trial.

Reg.  at 71,418.   The first benchmark  furnishes a safe\n\nharbor  for those  institutions  that  have distributed  athletic\n\nopportunities  in numbers  \"substantially  proportionate\" to  the\n\ngender composition  of their student bodies.   Thus, a university\n\nwhich does  not wish to  engage in extensive  compliance analysis\n\nmay stay  on the  sunny side of  Title IX  simply by  maintaining\n\ngender parity between its student body and its athletic lineup.\n\n          The second  and third  parts of the  accommodation test\n\nrecognize  that  there  are   circumstances  under  which,  as  a\n\npractical matter,  something short  of this proportionality  is a\n\nsatisfactory proxy for gender balance.  For example, so long as a\n\nuniversity is continually expanding athletic opportunities in  an\n\nongoing effort to meet the  needs of the underrepresented gender,\n\nand persists in this  approach as interest and ability  levels in\n\nits student body and secondary feeder schools rise, benchmark two\n\nis  satisfied and Title IX  does not require  that the university\n\nleap  to complete  gender parity  in a  single bound.   Or,  if a\n\nschool has a student body  in which one sex is demonstrably  less\n\ninterested in  athletics,  Title IX  does  not require  that  the\n\n                                18\n\nschool  create   teams  for,   or  rain  money   upon,  otherwise\n\ndisinterested students; rather, the  third benchmark is satisfied\n\nif the underrepresented sex's discernible interests are fully and\n\neffectively accommodated.13\n\n          It seems unlikely, even  in this day and age,  that the\n\nathletic  establishments  of   many  coeducational   universities\n\nreflect   the   gender   balance  of   their   student  bodies.14\n\nSimilarly, the recent boom in Title IX suits suggests that, in an\n\nera of  fiscal austerity,  few universities  are prone  to expand\n\nathletic opportunities.  It is not surprising, then, that schools\n\nmore often than not attempt  to manage the rigors of Title  IX by\n\nsatisfying the  interests and abilities  of the  underrepresented\n\ngender,   that  is,  by  meeting   the  third  benchmark  of  the\n\naccommodation  test.  Yet,  this benchmark sets  a high standard:\n\nit demands  not merely some accommodation, but full and effective\n\n                    \n\n     13OCR also lists a series of illustrative justifications for\nthe  disparate treatment  of  men's and  women's athletic  teams,\nincluding (1) sports  that require more resources  because of the\nnature of the game (e.g.,  contact sports generally require  more\n                        \nequipment),  (2)  special circumstances,  such  as  an influx  of\nfirst-year players, that may require an extraordinary infusion of\nresources,  (3) special operational expenses (e.g., crowd control\n                                                  \nat  a  basketball tournament),  as  long  as special  operational\nexpense needs  are  met  for  both genders  and  (4)  affirmative\nmeasures to remedy past limitations on athletic opportunities for\none gender.  44 Fed. Reg. at 71,415-16.\n\n     14Success  in this  regard is,  however, attainable.   After\nWashington State University was ordered to increase participation\nopportunities for women to a level equivalent with the percentage\nof female  undergraduates, see  Blair v. Washington  State Univ.,\n                                                                \n740  P.2d   1379   (Wash.  1987),   the  University   experienced\nconsiderable success  in meeting  court-ordered goals.   See Mary\n                                                            \nJordan, Only  One School  Meets Gender Equity  Goal, Wash.  Post,\n                                                   \nJune 21, 1992, at D1.\n\n                                19\n\naccommodation.  If there is sufficient interest and ability among\n\nmembers of the statistically  underrepresented gender, not slaked\n\nby existing programs, an institution necessarily fails this prong\n\nof the test.\n\n          Although the  full-and-effective-accommodation standard\n\nis  high,  it  is   not  absolute.    Even  when   male  athletic\n\nopportunities  outnumber female  athletic opportunities,  and the\n\nuniversity  has   not  met   the  first   benchmark  (substantial\n\nstatistical proportionality) or  the second benchmark (continuing\n\nprogram expansion) of the accommodation test, the mere fact  that\n\nthere are some  female students  interested in a  sport does  not\n\nipso facto require the school to provide a varsity team in  order\n          \n\nto  comply with the third benchmark.  Rather, the institution can\n\nsatisfy   the   third   benchmark   by   ensuring   participatory\n\nopportunities  at  the intercollegiate  level  when,  and to  the\n\nextent that, there is \"sufficient interest  and ability among the\n\nmembers  of the  excluded  sex to  sustain  a viable  team and  a\n\nreasonable  expectation of  intercollegiate competition  for that\n\nteam .  . . .\"   44 Fed. Reg. at  71,418.  Staying on  top of the\n\nproblem is not sport for the short-winded:   the institution must\n\nremain   vigilant,   \"upgrading  the   competitive  opportunities\n\navailable to  the historically disadvantaged sex  as warranted by\n\ndeveloping abilities among the athletes of that  sex,\" id., until\n                                                          \n\nthe opportunities for, and  levels of, competition are equivalent\n\n                                20\n\nby gender.15\n\n          Brown   argues   that   DED's  Policy   Interpretation,\n\nconstrued  as we have  just outlined, goes so  far afield that it\n\ncountervails the  enabling legislation.  Brown  suggests that, to\n\nthe extent students' interests in athletics are  disproportionate\n\nby  gender, colleges  should be  allowed to meet  those interests\n\nincompletely  as  long  as the  school's  response  is in  direct\n\nproportion to the  comparative levels of interest.   Put bluntly,\n\nBrown reads the \"full\" out of the duty to accommodate  \"fully and\n\neffectively.\"      It   argues   instead  that   an   institution\n\nsatisfactorily  accommodates  female  athletes  if  it  allocates\n\nathletic  opportunities to women in accordance  with the ratio of\n                                                                 \n\ninterested and able  women to interested and able men, regardless\n                                                     \n\nof the number of unserved women or the  percentage of the student\n\nbody that they comprise.\n\n          Because  this is  mountainous terrain,  an example  may\n\nserve to clarify the distinction between Brown's proposal and our\n\nunderstanding of the law.   Suppose a university (Oooh U.)  has a\n\nstudent body  consisting of 1,000 men  and 1,000 women, a  one to\n\none ratio.   If 500  men and  250 women are  able and  interested\n\n                    \n\n     15If  in  the  course  of  adding  and  upgrading  teams,  a\nuniversity attains gender parity between its athletic program and\nits  student   body,  it  meets   the  first  benchmark   of  the\naccommodation test.  But, Title IX does not require that a school\npour ever-increasing sums into its athletic establishment.  If  a\nuniversity  prefers to  take  another route,  it  can also  bring\nitself  into   compliance  with   the  first  benchmark   of  the\naccommodation test  by subtraction  and downgrading, that  is, by\nreducing  opportunities  for  the  overrepresented  gender  while\nkeeping opportunities stable for the underrepresented gender  (or\nreducing them to a much lesser extent).\n\n                                21\n\nathletes,  the ratio of interested men to interested women is two\n\nto one.   Brown takes  the position that  both the actual  gender\n\ncomposition of  the  student  body  and whether  there  is  unmet\n\ninterest among  the  underrepresented gender  are irrelevant;  in\n\norder to satisfy the  third benchmark, Oooh U. must  only provide\n\nathletic  opportunities in  line with  the two to  one interested\n\nathlete  ratio, say,  100 slots for  men and 50  slots for women.\n\nUnder this view, the interest  of 200 women would be unmet    but\n\nthere would be no Title IX violation.\n\n          We  think  that  Brown's  perception of  the  Title  IX\n\nuniverse  is myopic.  The fact that the overrepresented gender is\n\nless than fully accommodated will not, in and of itself, excuse a\n\nshortfall   in   the   provision   of   opportunities   for   the\n\nunderrepresented gender.  Rather, the  law requires that, in  the\n\nabsence of continuing program  expansion (benchmark two), schools\n\neither meet benchmark one  by providing athletic opportunities in\n\nproportion to the gender composition of the student body (in Oooh\n\nU.'s case, a roughly equal number  of slots for men and women, as\n\nthe  student body is equally divided), or meet benchmark three by\n\nfully    accommodating    interested    athletes     among    the\n\nunderrepresented  sex  (providing,  at  Oooh U.,  250  slots  for\n\nwomen).16\n\n                    \n\n     16Of  course, if Oooh U. takes the benchmark three route, it\nwill also have to provide  at least the same number of  slots for\nmen; but, so long as women remain the underrepresented gender and\ntheir  interests  are  fully  accommodated,  the  university  can\nprovide as many (or as  few) additional slots for men as  it sees\nfit.\n\n                                22\n\n          In  the final  analysis, Brown's view  is wrong  on two\n\nscores.   It  is wrong  as  a matter  of  law, for  DED's  Policy\n\nInterpretation,   which  requires   full  accommodation   of  the\n\nunderrepresented gender,  draws  its essence  from  the  statute.\n\nWhether  Brown's concept  might  be thought  more attractive,  or\n\nwhether  we, if  writing  on a  pristine  page, would  craft  the\n\nregulation  in a manner different  than the agency,  are not very\n\nimportant considerations.  Because  the agency's rendition stands\n\nupon a plausible, if not inevitable, reading of Title IX,  we are\n\nobligated  to enforce the regulation according to its tenor.  See\n                                                                 \n\nChevron, 467 U.S.  at 843 n.11  (holding that  a \"court need  not\n       \n\nconclude  that  the  agency  construction  was  the  only one  it\n\npermissibly could  have  adopted  to  uphold  [it]\")  (collecting\n\ncases); Massachusetts v. Secretary of  Agric., 984 F.2d 514,  522\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (similar).\n\n          Brown's reading of Title  IX is legally flawed  for yet\n\nanother reason.  It  proceeds from the premise that  the agency's\n\nthird  benchmark countervails  Title  IX.   But, this  particular\n\nimprecation of  the third benchmark  overlooks the  accommodation\n\ntest's  general purpose:  to determine whether a student has been\n\n\"excluded from participation in, [or] denied the benefits  of\" an\n\nathletic  program \"on  the basis  of sex .  . .  .\"   20 U.S.C.  \n\n1681(a).   While any single  element of this  tripartite test, in\n\nisolation, might not  achieve the  goal set by  the statute,  the\n\ntest  as  a  whole is  reasonably  constructed  to implement  the\n\nstatute.   No more  is exigible.    See Chemical  Mfrs. Ass'n  v.\n                                                             \n\n                                23\n\nNatural  Resources  Defense  Council,  Inc., 470  U.S.  116,  125\n                                           \n\n(1985).\n\n          As it happens, Brown's view is also poor policy for, in\n\nthe long run, a rule such as Brown advances would  likely make it\n\nmore  difficult for colleges  to ensure  that they  have complied\n\nwith Title IX.  Given that the survey of  interests and abilities\n\nwould begin under circumstances where men's athletic teams have a\n\nconsiderable head start, such a rule would almost certainly blunt\n\nthe  exhortation  that  schools  should \"take  into  account  the\n\nnationally increasing levels of women's  interests and abilities\"\n\nand avoid \"disadvantag[ing] members  of an underrepresented sex .\n\n. . .\"  44 Fed. Reg. at 71,417.\n\n          Brown's    proposal    would    also   aggravate    the\n\nquantification problems  that are inevitably bound  up with Title\n\nIX.   Student plaintiffs, who  carry the burden  of proof on this\n\nissue, as well as  universities monitoring self-compliance, would\n\nbe required  to assess the level of interest in both the male and\n\nfemale  student  populations   and  determine  comparatively  how\n\ncompletely the university was serving the interests of each  sex.\n\nBy contrast, as we read the accommodation test's third benchmark,\n\nit requires  a relatively simple  assessment of whether  there is\n\nunmet need in the  underrepresented gender that rises to  a level\n\nsufficient to warrant a new team or the upgrading of an  existing\n\nteam.  We think the simpler reading is far more serviceable.\n\n          Furthermore, by moving away from OCR's third benchmark,\n\nwhich focuses on the levels of interest and ability extant in the\n\n                                24\n\nstudent body,  Brown's theory invites thorny questions  as to the\n\nappropriate  survey  population,  whether  from  the  university,\n\ntypical  feeder schools, or the regional community.  In that way,\n\nBrown's  proposal would  do  little more  than overcomplicate  an\n\nalready complex equation.\n\n          We will  not paint the  lily.  Brown's  approach cannot\n\nwithstand  scrutiny  on  either  legal  or policy  grounds.    We\n\nconclude that  DED's Policy Interpretation means  exactly what it\n\nsays.  This plain  meaning is a proper, permissible  rendition of\n\nthe statute.\n\nIV.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE\n\n          We  turn  now  to  a series  of  case-specific  issues,\n\nstarting with Brown's  constitutional challenge to  the statutory\n\nscheme.\n\n                      A.  Equal Protection.\n                                          \n\n          Brown  asseverates  that  if  the  third  part  of  the\n\naccommodation test  is read as OCR wrote it   to require full and\n\neffective accommodation of the underrepresented gender   the test\n\nviolates the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  We think\n\nnot.\n\n          Brown  assumes that  full  and effective  accommodation\n\ndisadvantages  male  athletes.17   While  it might  well  be that\n\n                    \n\n     17In  characterizing  Title IX  as  benefitting only  women,\n                                                         \nBrown takes a rather isthmian view  of the world at large.  After\nall,  colleges   that  have  converted  from  exclusively  female\nenrollment to coeducational enrollment face situations inverse to\nBrown's.  In such a setting, the men's athletic program  may well\nbe  underdeveloped,   or  underfunded,  or   both,  while  fiscal\nretrenchment  offers no  reprieve.    Under these  circumstances,\n\n                                25\n\nmore  men than women at Brown are currently interested in sports,\n\nBrown points to no evidence  in the record that men are  any more\n\nlikely to  engage in  athletics than women,  absent socialization\n\nand  disparate  opportunities.   In  the  absence  of  any  proof\n\nsupporting  Brown's  claim,  and  in view  of  congressional  and\n\nadministrative urging  that women,  given  the opportunity,  will\n\nnaturally participate in athletics in numbers equal to men, we do\n\nnot find  that  the regulation,  when  read in  the  common-sense\n\nmanner  that its  language  suggests, see  supra Part  III(C)(3),\n                                                \n\noffends the Fifth Amendment.\n\n          What is more, even if we were to assume, for argument's\n\nsake, that the regulation creates a gender classification slanted\n\nsomewhat  in  favor of  women,  we would  find  no constitutional\n\ninfirmity.  It is clear that Congress has  broad powers under the\n\nFifth Amendment  to remedy past discrimination.  See, e.g., Metro\n                                                                 \n\nBroadcasting, Inc. v. FCC,  110 S.

If the  district court did not engage in  the proper\nfactfinding,  then   its  order  constitutes  an   abuse  of  its\ndiscretion.

BURDEN OF PROOF\n\n          In addition  to  its constitutional  challenges,  Brown\n\nquestions the district court's allocation of the burden of proof.\n\nIt  suggests  that  the  analytic  model of  burden  setting  and\n\nshifting  commonly accepted  in Title  VII  and ADEA  cases, see,\n                                                                \n\ne.g.,  Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248,\n                                                  \n\n254  (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-\n                                             \n\n05 (1973); Mesnick v.  General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816,  823 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1991), cert. denied,  112 S. Ct.  2965 (1992), is  ripe for\n                         \n\nimportation  into the precincts patrolled by Title IX.  We reject\n\nthe suggestion.\n\n          In our view, there  is no need to search  for analogies\n\nwhere,  as in the Title  IX milieu, the  controlling statutes and\n\nregulations  are clear.  To  invoke the prophylaxis  of Title IX,\n\nthe  statute, 20  U.S.C.    1681(b),  and  the regulations,  read\n\ntogether, require a Title IX plaintiff to show disparity  between\n\nthe gender composition of the  institution's student body and its\n\nathletic   program,    thereby   proving   that   there   is   an\n\nunderrepresented gender.   Then, the plaintiff  must show that  a\n\nsecond element   unmet  interest   is  present.  In other  words,\n\nthe plaintiff must prove that the underrepresented gender has not\n\nbeen \"fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.\"\n\n44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418.   If the plaintiff carries the  devoir of\n\n                                28\n\npersuasion  on these two elements, she has proven her case unless\n\nthe university shows,  as an affirmative defense,  \"a history and\n\ncontinuing practice of  program expansion  which is  demonstrably\n\nresponsive  to  the developing  interests  and  abilities of  the\n\nmembers\" of the underrepresented gender.  Id.\n                                             \n\n          Over and beyond the  express dictates of the applicable\n\nstatute  and  regulations,  there  is another  valid  reason  for\n\neschewing the  Title VII paradigm  in most  Title IX cases.   The\n\nscope and purpose of Title IX, which merely conditions government\n\ngrants to educational  institutions, are substantially  different\n\nfrom those of  Title VII, which sets  basic employment standards.\n\nSee  Franklin v.  Gwinnett County  Pub. Sch.,  911 F.2d  617, 622\n                                            \n\n(11th  Cir. 1990) (declining to apply Title VII analysis to Title\n\nIX litigation), aff'd, 112 S.  Ct. 1028 (1992).  Title IX,  while\n                     \n\nit applies only to schools that receive federal funds, influences\n\nalmost all aspects of educational management.  In contrast, Title\n\nVII applies to a much wider range of institutions   virtually all\n\nemployers      but   targets  only   employment-related  matters.\n\nMoreover,  Title IX  is  largely  aspirational    on  the  whole,\n\naffected institutions choose how to accomplish the statutory goal\n\n  whereas  Title VII is  largely peremptory    covered  employers\n\nmust  adhere  to statutorily  prescribed  standards.   Thus,  the\n\nformer is a loosely laced buskin, inhospitable to the specialized\n\nchoreography  of  presumption  and  production   upon  which  the\n\nBurdine/McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework depends.\n                         \n\n          We conclude,  therefore, that excepting  perhaps in the\n\n                                29\n\nemployment discrimination  context, see Lipsett v.  University of\n                                                                 \n\nP.R.,  864  F.2d 881,  897 (1st  Cir.  1988) (applying  Title VII\n    \n\nstandards in Title IX case, but explicitly limiting the crossover\n\nto the  employment context), the Title  VII burden-of-proof rules\n\ndo  not apply  in Title  IX cases.20   Consequently,  a Title  IX\n\nplaintiff makes  out an  athletic discrimination case  by proving\n\nnumerical disparity, coupled with unmet interest,  each by a fair\n\npreponderance  of the credible evidence, so long as the defendant\n\ndoes not  rebut the plaintiff's showing  by adducing preponderant\n\nhistory-and-practice evidence.\n\nVI.  THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n\n          We come at  long last  to the cynosure  of the  appeal.\n\nThis  is  familiar territory.   A  district  court, faced  with a\n\nmotion  for preliminary  injunction, must  assess the  request in\n\nfour particular ways, evaluating  (1) the movant's probability of\n\nvictory  on the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm if\n\nthe  injunction  is refused;  (3)  the  balance  of interests  as\n\nbetween the  parties, i.e., whether the harm to the movant if the\n                          \n\ninjunction is withheld outweighs the harm to the nonmovant if the\n\ninjunction  is  granted;  and  (4)  the  public  interest.    See\n                                                                 \n\nNarragansett  Indian Tribe v. Guilbert,  934 F.2d 4,  5 (1st Cir.\n                                      \n\n1991); Aoude v.  Mobil Oil  Corp., 862  F.2d 890,  892 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1988); Hypertherm, Inc. v. Precision Prods., Inc.,  832 F.2d 697,\n                                                 \n\n                    \n\n     20But  cf.  Cook v.  Colgate Univ.,  802  F. Supp.  737, 743\n                                       \n(N.D.N.Y. 1992) (applying Title  VII process to Title IX  case at\nurging  of parties).  Cook  is presently on  appeal to the Second\n                          \nCircuit.  See supra note 4.\n                   \n\n                                30\n\n699  &amp;  n.2  (1st Cir.  1987).   Of  course,  a  district court's\n\nconclusions at the preliminary injunction stage are only attempts\n\nto predict probable outcomes.   Thus, \"a party losing  the battle\n\non  likelihood  of  success may  nonetheless  win  the  war at  a\n\nsucceeding trial . . . .\"  Guilbert, 934 F.2d at 6.\n                                   \n\n          If, in conducting this tamisage, the district court has\n\nmade  no  clear  error  of law  or  fact,  we  will overturn  its\n\ncalibration  of the  four factors  only for  a manifest  abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   See Weaver v. Henderson, 984  F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir.\n                                     \n\n1993); Guilbert, 934 F.2d at 5.\n               \n\n          Here,  the district  court  found that  the quadrat  of\n\nfactors favored plaintiffs' position.  See Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at\n                                                \n\n985-1001.   Brown disagrees with  these findings up  and down the\n\nline,  but offers developed argumentation only as to three of the\n\nfour components.  Because Brown does not explain its challenge to\n\nthe district court's  finding that the  public interest would  be\n\ndisserved by leaving the two women's teams on the sidelines until\n\nthe suit  is finally resolved, we ignore its pro forma protest in\n                                                      \n\nthat respect.   Litigants  cannot  preserve an  issue for  appeal\n\nsimply  by  raising  a pennant  and  then  moving  on to  another\n\nsubject.   See United States v.  Slade, 980 F.2d 27,  30-31 &amp; n.3\n                                      \n\n(1st Cir. 1992)  (reiterating that theories not briefed or argued\n\non appeal  are waived); Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734\n                                              \n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (stating  that \"issues adverted to on appeal in a\n\nperfunctory    manner,    unaccompanied    by   some    developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned\").  Accordingly,\n\n                                31\n\nwe limit our review to the three factors briefed and argued. \n\n                    A.  Likelihood of Success.\n                                             \n\n          It is old hat, but  still very much in fashion, that  a\n\nmovant's   likelihood  of  success   at  trial   is  particularly\n\ninfluential in the preliminary  injunction calculus.  See Weaver,\n                                                                \n\n984 F.2d at 12; Guilbert, 934 F.2d at 6; Public Serv. Co. v. Town\n                                                                 \n\nof  West Newbury,  835 F.2d 380,  383 (1st  Cir. 1987).   In this\n                \n\ncase,  the  district  court  paid  meticulous  attention  to  the\n\nparties' prospects for  success over  the long haul.   The  court\n\nplainly  visualized  both  the  factual   intricacies  and  legal\n\ncomplexities that  characterize Title IX  litigation.  It  held a\n\nlengthy  adversary   hearing  and  reviewed   voluminous  written\n\nsubmissions.  And at  journey's end, it correctly focused  on the\n\nthree-part accommodation test.\n\n          The court faultlessly dispatched the first two elements\n\nof  the test.   With  respect to  the comparison  between Brown's\n\nathletic  agenda and  student body,  we  adopt the  lower court's\n\nrecord-rooted  finding that the University did not meet   or even\n\nclosely  approach    the \"substantial  proportionality\" threshold\n\nbecause  it offered too few varsity opportunities for women.  See\n                                                                 \n\nCohen, 809  F. Supp.  at 991.   Cognizant, perhaps, that  the raw\n     \n\nnumbers tell an  unambiguous tale, Brown  does not challenge  the\n\ninviolability of this finding.\n\n          As  to the  test's second  part, the court  below found\n\nthat, although Brown  could point to  \"impressive growth\" in  its\n\nwomen's athletic  program  in  the  1970s,  the  school  had  not\n\n                                32\n\ncontinued  filling the gap during the next  two decades.  Id.  On\n                                                             \n\nthis  basis, the  court  concluded that  Brown  had not  met  the\n\nbenchmark.  See id.  Brown asserts that  the district court erred\n                   \n\nby not crediting  it sufficiently for  its dramatic expansion  of\n\nwomen's   sports  in  the   1970s,  and   we  are   not  entirely\n\nunsympathetic  to this plea.  In the last analysis, however, this\n\nwas  a judgment  call  and the  trial  court's judgment  was  not\n\nunreasonable.   While a university deserves  appreciable applause\n\nfor  supercharging a  low-voltage athletic  program in  one burst\n\nrather  than powering  it  up  over  a  longer  period,  such  an\n\nenergization,   once  undertaken,  does   not  forever  hold  the\n\ninstitution harmless.  Here, Brown labored for six years to weave\n\na broad array of new activities into the fabric of its palestrian\n\nofferings.  The district court apparently believed, however, that\n\nBrown  then rested on its  laurels for at  least twice that long.\n\nThe very length of this hiatus  suggests something far short of a\n\ncontinuing  practice  of program  expansion.    And, moreover,  a\n          \n\nuniversity must design expansion in whatever form and at whatever\n\npace to respond  to the  flux and reflux  of unserved  interests.\n\nThe court  below found that Brown  failed in this task.   See id.\n                                                                 \n\nThe  issue  of  responsiveness  is  fact-intensive  and  in  most\n\ninstances, as  here, its  resolution will  be within the  trier's\n\nprovince.  We find  no error, therefore, in the  district court's\n\nresolution of the second aspect of the accommodation test.\n\n          The  third  benchmark   presents  a  more   problematic\n\nscenario.   The district  court incorrectly held  that Brown bore\n\n                                33\n\nthe  burden  of  showing  that  it  had  fully  and   effectively\n\naccommodated the  interests and abilities of  its women athletes.\n\nSee  id. at 997.   Section 1681(b) requires  that the plaintiffs,\n        \n\nrather than the  University, prove  a shortfall in  the full  and\n\neffective accommodation of interested female athletes by showing,\n\ninitially,  both numerical  disparity  and unmet  interest.   See\n                                                                 \n\nsupra Part  V.   Nonetheless, we  do not think  that the  court's\n     \n\nbevue is  fatal.  Even  when a  trial court has  misconstrued the\n\nlaw, an appellate tribunal  may avoid remanding if the  record is\n\nsufficiently  developed  and the  facts  necessary  to shape  the\n\nproper legal matrix  are sufficiently clear.   See, e.g., Societe\n                                                                 \n\nDes Produits Nestle, S.A.  v. Casa Helvetia, Inc., 982  F.2d 633,\n                                                 \n\n642 (1st  Cir. 1992) (coupling district  court's factual findings\n\nwith correct rule of law);  United States v.

Although the full and  effective\n\naccommodation of athletic interests is likely to be a complicated\n\nissue where allegedly underrepresented  plaintiffs sue to force a\n\nuniversity  to create a neoteric team or  upgrade the status of a\n\nclub team,  see,  e.g., Cook,  802  F.  Supp. at  737,  there  is\n                            \n\nunlikely  to be any comparably turbid question as to interest and\n\n                                34\n\nability  where,  as  here,   plaintiffs  are  seeking  merely  to\n\nforestall the interment of healthy varsity teams.\n\n          In  this  instance,  the  district  court's  subsidiary\n\nfindings  of  fact render  it  beyond cavil  that  the plaintiffs\n\ncarried their burden  of proof.   The court  found, for  example,\n\nthat there was \"great interest and talent\" amongst Brown's female\n\nundergraduates  which,  following  the cuts,  would  go unserved.\n\nCohen, 809 F. Supp. at 992.  Of particular moment, the court also\n     \n\nfound  the interest and talent on campus ample to support women's\n\nvarsity volleyball and gymnastics teams, see id.   a finding that\n                                                \n\nis hardly surprising in  view of the teams' robust  health before\n\nthe  budget-cutters arrived on the scene.  The court proceeded to\n\nnote that, while  club teams can be equivalent to intercollegiate\n\nteams when they regularly participate in varsity competition, see\n                                                                 \n\n44 Fed. Reg. at 71,413 n.1, the teams that Brown downgraded would\n\nnot regularly be competing against varsity teams and would suffer\n\na  diminution  of status  in a  wide  range of  other significant\n\nrespects.  See Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 992-93.\n                    \n\n          The potency  of this evidence is  an effective antidote\n\nto the district  court's partial misapplication of  the burden of\n\nproof.   Because the record  contains nothing that  would allow a\n\ntrier to find that Brown's athletic agenda reflects the makeup of\n\nits  student  body  or that  the  plaintiff  class  is so  poorly\n\npopulated as  to warrant  a reduction  in  women's sports,21  the\n\n                    \n\n     21It  bears mentioning  in  this regard  that Judge  Pettine\nheard, and  apparently credited, evidence  indicating that  there\nwere  other  women's  club teams  sufficiently  accomplished  and\n\n                                35\n\ncourt's  error was harmless.   In a nutshell,  the plaintiffs met\n\ntheir challenge on parts one and three of the accommodation test.\n\nThis  conclusion,  in  partnership  with   the  district  court's\n\nsupportable finding that Brown did not satisfactorily demonstrate\n\na continuing  expansion of  its women's athletic  lineup, strikes\n\nthe gold.  The court's prediction of plaintiffs' probable success\n\nwas, therefore, adequately grounded.\n\n                     B.  Irreparable Injury.\n                                           \n\n          The  next area  of inquiry  is irreparable  harm.   The\n\ndistrict court  heard from  a variety of  athletic administration\n\nexperts.  The court concluded that, absent judicial intervention,\n\nthe plaintiffs would suffer irremediable injury in at least three\n\nrespects:    competitive   posture,  recruitment,  and   loss  of\n\ncoaching.   As  club teams,  the district  court thought  women's\n\nvolleyball   and  gymnastics   would  increasingly   become  less\n\ncompetitive, have  fewer players,  be unable to  schedule varsity\n\nteams from other schools,  become unattractive to potential stars\n\nmaking college  choices, and suffer  stagnation in the  growth of\n\nindividual talent due to  the absence of coaching.22   See Cohen,\n                                                                \n\n809 F. Supp.  at 992-93.   Certainly, these harms  exist to  some\n\ndegree.  In highly nuanced cases involving a melange of competing\n\n                    \n\npopulated to flourish as varsity squads.

Supp. at\n                                               \n992.\n\n     22Brown does not retain  coaches for its club teams  and few\nof the teams  have the independent financial  wherewithal to hire\ncoaches.  Here, the district court specifically found that if the\ngymnastics team  was downgraded to  club status, it  would likely\nlose  its paid coach when  her contract expired  in June of 1993.\nCohen, 809 F. Supp. at 992.\n     \n\n                                36\n\nconsiderations, the aggregate  injury, and whether  or not it  is\n\nirreparable, come primarily within the trial court's ken.  See K-\n                                                                 \n\nMart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza,  Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 915 (1st  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1989)   (acknowledging   that  \"[d]istrict   courts   have  broad\n\ndiscretion  to  evaluate  the  irreparability  of  alleged harm\")\n\n(citation omitted).  So it is  here.  Although the types of harms\n\nthe court  catalogued might  not all  rise to the  same level  of\n\nseriousness, the overall record supports, even though it does not\n\ncompel,  the court's  assessment  of  their cumulative  severity.\n\nGiven,  especially,  the  lack  of any  other  concinnous  remedy\n\npendente  lite, we  will  not second-guess  the district  court's\n              \n\nfinding of irreparable injury.\n\n                    C.  The Balance of Harms.\n                                            \n\n          Finally, the  district court  found that the  competing\n\nequities weighed  in favor  of granting  the  injunction.   After\n\nhearing testimony  from Brown's Financial Vice-President  and its\n\nAssociate Athletic Director,  the district  court concluded  that\n\nthe cost  of the interim  injunction would be  relatively slight;\n\nand that, in view of discretionary funds already contained in the\n\nAthletic Department budget and a presidential \"contingency fund,\"\n\nBrown possessed the wherewithal to defray the costs without undue\n\nhardship.  See Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 1000-01.   By contrast, the\n                    \n\ncourt noted  the volleyball  and gymnastics  programs' continuing\n\ndeterioration in the aftermath  of the demotion.  See id. at 992-\n                                                         \n\n93.  On balance,  the court determined that the  financial burden\n\non  Brown was tolerable, and,  in any event,  was overbalanced by\n\n                                37\n\nthe potential harm to  the plaintiff class  if the court took  no\n\naction.\n\n          Brown  contests the  results of  this balancing  on the\n\npremise that the district  court wrongly discounted the testimony\n\nof  one  of its  witnesses and  did  not adequately  consider the\n\npossibility  that false  hopes might  be raised by  a preliminary\n\ninjunction.  It  is, however,  axiomatic that  a district  court,\n\nsitting  without a jury, may selectively discount testimony as it\n\nweighs  conflicting viewpoints  and adjudicates  the facts.   See\n                                                                 \n\nBose Corp. v.  Consumers Union of U.S.,  Inc., 466 U.S.  485, 500\n                                             \n\n(1984);  Anthony v. Sundlun, 952  F.2d 603, 606  (1st Cir. 1991).\n                           \n\nThis is a trial court's prerogative and, indeed, its duty.\n\n          It   is  similarly   fundamental  that   a  preliminary\n\ninjunction, by its very nature,  is sometimes ephemeral.   Hence,\n\nthe  risk  that  some  observers  might  read  into  a  temporary\n\nrestrainer more than it  eventually proves to mean is  endemic to\n\nthe equitable device and cannot tip the scales against its use in\n\nany particular  circumstance.  It  defies elemental logic  to say\n\nthat parties  who the court has determined  will probably succeed\n\nat trial should  be denied the  interim relief to which  they are\n\nentitled because  their ultimate victory is  less than absolutely\n\ncertain.\n\n          In  fine,  the district  court  did  not overspill  its\n\ndiscretion either  in taking Brown's  self-interested description\n\nof  its financial plight with a grain  of salt or in limiting the\n\nrole that  raising  false  hopes  might  play  in  the  equitable\n\n                                38\n\ncalculus.\n\n                         D.  Summing Up.\n                                       \n\n          We summarize succinctly, beginning with the probability\n\nof  plaintiffs' success.  In an era where the practices of higher\n\neducation must  adjust to stunted revenues,  careening costs, and\n\nchanging  demographics, colleges  might well  be obliged  to curb\n\nspending  on programs,  like athletics,  that do  not lie  at the\n\nepicenter  of their  institutional mission.    Title IX  does not\n\npurport to  override financial  necessity.   Yet, the  pruning of\n\nathletic  budgets  cannot  take  place  solely  in  comptrollers'\n\noffices, isolated from the legislative and regulatory imperatives\n\nthat Title IX imposes.\n\n          This case aptly illustrates the point.  Brown earnestly\n\nprofesses that it has done  no more than slash women's and  men's\n\nathletics by  approximately the same degree, and, indeed, the raw\n\nnumbers lend  partial credence to that  characterization.23  But,\n\nBrown's claim overlooks the shortcomings that plagued its program\n\nbefore it took  blade in hand.  If a  school, like Brown, eschews\n\nthe first  two benchmarks of the accommodation  test, electing to\n\nstray from  substantial  proportionality  and  failing  to  march\n\nuninterruptedly in the direction  of equal athletic  opportunity,\n\nit must  comply with the third  benchmark.  To do  so, the school\n\n                    \n\n     23We note, however,  that while the  cuts proposed by  Brown\neliminate a  roughly equal  number of athletic  opportunities for\nwomen as for  men, those  cuts subtract roughly  four times  more\nmoney  from  the budget  for  female pancratiasts  than  from the\nbudget for their male counterparts.   See supra pp. 4-5.  And, as\n                                               \na noted playwright once observed, \"where there is no money, there\nis no change of any kind.\"  Moss Hart, Act One (1959).\n                                              \n\n                                39\n\nmust  fully  and  effectively  accommodate  the  underrepresented\n\ngender's interests  and abilities,  even if  that requires  it to\n\ngive  the  underrepresented gender  (in  this  case, women)  what\n\namounts  to a  larger slice  of a  shrinking athletic-opportunity\n\npie.\n\n          The record  reveals that the  court below paid  heed to\n\nthese realities.  It  properly recognized that even  balanced use\n\nof the budget-paring knife runs afoul of Title IX where, as here,\n\nthe  fruits  of  a  university's  athletic  program  remain  ill-\n\ndistributed after the trimming takes place.  Because the district\n\ncourt understood this principle, and because its findings of fact\n\nas to  the  case's  probable  outcome are  based  on  substantial\n\nevidence, the court's determination that plaintiffs are likely to\n\nsucceed on the merits is inexpugnable.\n\n          The  district  court  displayed  similar  dexterity  in\n\ntouching the other three bases en  route to a grant of injunctive\n\nrelief:    irreparability  of  injury,  the  relative  weight  of\n\npotential  harms, and impact on  the public interest.   The court\n\nfound that  the harm  to  the plaintiff  class was  irremediable,\n\nabsent  prompt  injunctive  relief;  that the  balance  of  harms\n\nfavored such relief; and that the overriding public  interest lay\n\nin the firm enforcement of Title IX.   In each of these areas, as\n\nin  the  likelihood-of-success  arena,   the  court  made  serial\n\nfindings  that, taken  at  face value,  amply justify  injunctive\n\nrelief.  Because these findings derive  adequate support from the\n\nrecord, the court's  decree must  stand as long  as the  specific\n\n                                40\n\nrelief the court ordered  was appropriate.   It is to this  issue\n\nthat we now turn.\n\nVII.  REMEDIATION\n\n          After applying the preliminary injunction standard, the\n\ndistrict   court  ordered   relief  pendente   lite,  temporarily\n                                                   \n\nreinstating the  women's volleyball and gymnastics  teams.  Brown\n\nargues  that such  specific  relief is  inappropriate because  it\n\nintrudes on Brown's discretion.  The  point has some cogency.  We\n\nare a society that cherishes academic freedom and recognizes that\n\nuniversities  deserve great  leeway  in their  operations.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Wynne v. Tufts Univ.  Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791,  795 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1992), petition for cert. filed (Feb. 3, 1993); Lamphere v.\n                                                              \n\nBrown Univ., 875  F.2d 916,  922 (1st Cir.  1989).  In  addition,\n           \n\nTitle  IX does not  require institutions  to fund  any particular\n\nnumber or type of athletic opportunities   only that they provide\n\nthose opportunities  in a nondiscriminatory fashion  if they wish\n\nto receive federal funds.\n\n          Nonetheless, the district court has broad discretionary\n\npower to take provisional steps restoring the status quo  pending\n\nthe conclusion of a trial.  See Ricci v. Okin, 978 F.2d  764, 767\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1992); Guilbert, 934 F.2d  at 7 &amp; n.3.  Considering the\n                         \n\ndistrict court's  proper estimation  and deft application  of the\n\npreliminary injunction standard, see supra Part VI, we think that\n                                          \n\nrequiring Brown to maintain the women's volleyball and gymnastics\n\nteams in varsity status for  the time being is a remedial  choice\n\nwithin  the district  court's discretion.   That  is not  to say,\n\n                                41\n\nhowever, that the same remedy will be suitable at trial's end  if\n\nthe Title IX charges prove out against Brown.  The district court\n\nhas noted, we believe appropriately, that if it  ultimately finds\n\nBrown's  athletic program to violate  Title IX, it will initially\n\nrequire the University to propose  a compliance plan rather  than\n\nmandate the  creation or  deletion of particular  athletic teams.\n\nCohen, 809 F. Supp. at 1001.  Although the district court has the\n     \n\npower to  order  specific relief  if  the institution  wishes  to\n\ncontinue receiving  federal funds,  see Franklin,  112 S.  Ct. at\n                                                \n\n1035, the many routes to Title IX compliance make specific relief\n\nmost useful in situations where the institution, after a judicial\n\ndetermination of noncompliance,  demonstrates an unwillingness or\n\ninability to exercise its discretion in a way that brings it into\n\ncompliance with Title IX.\n\nVIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go  no further.   This  litigation presents  an\n\narray  of complicated and important issues at a crossroads of the\n\nlaw that few  courts have explored.  The beacon  by which we must\n\nsteer is  Congress's unmistakably clear  mandate that educational\n\ninstitutions  not use  federal monies to  perpetuate gender-based\n\ndiscrimination.   At the same  time, we must  remain sensitive to\n\nthe fact that  suits of  this genre implicate  the discretion  of\n\nuniversities  to pursue  their  missions  free from  governmental\n\ninterference and,  in the bargain, to  deploy increasingly scarce\n\nresources in  the most  advantageous way.   These considerations,\n\neach of which is in service to desirable ends, are necessarily in\n\n                                42\n\ntension in Title IX cases.  Thus, there are unlikely  to be ideal\n\nsolutions  to  all the  vexing  problems  that might  potentially\n\narise.\n\n          This   appeal  exemplifies  many  of  the  difficulties\n\ninherent in Title IX litigation.   We do not presume to  say that\n\nthe  district court's interim solution is perfect, but it is fair\n\nand  it  is  lawful.    On  the  record  compiled  to  date,  the\n\npreliminary injunction  requiring Brown to reinstate  its women's\n\nvolleyball  and gymnastics  teams for  the time  being came  well\n\nwithin  the encincture  of  judicial  discretion.   We  will  not\n\nmeddle. \n\n          The preliminary  injunction is affirmed,  the temporary\n                                                                 \n\nstay  is dissolved,  and the  cause is  remanded to  the district\n                                                                 \n\ncourt for further proceedings.

Brown Univ.,  809 F.  Supp. 978 (D.R.I.  1992).   After\n                     \n\nmapping  Title IX's rugged  legal terrain and  cutting a passable\n\nswath through  the factual thicket that  overspreads the parties'\n\narguments, we affirm.\n\nI.  BROWN ATHLETICS:  AN OVERVIEW\n\n          College  athletics,   particularly  in  the   realm  of\n\nfootball and basketball,  has traditionally occupied  a prominent\n\nrole  in  American  sports  and American  society.    For college\n\nstudents, athletics offers an  opportunity to exacuate leadership\n\nskills, learn teamwork, build  self-confidence, and perfect self-\n\ndiscipline.    In addition,  for many  student-athletes, physical\n\nskills  are a  passport to  college admissions  and scholarships,\n\nallowing them  to attend  otherwise inaccessible schools.   These\n\nopportunities, and the lessons learned on the playing fields, are\n\ninvaluable in attaining career  and life successes in and  out of\n\nprofessional sports.\n\n          The  highway of  opportunity runs  in both  directions.\n\n                    \n\n     1The individual defendants are, respectively,  the President\nand  Athletic Director of  the University.   Each is  sued in his\nofficial capacity.  For ease in reference, we discuss this appeal\nas if Brown was  the sole defendant and appellant.   Nonetheless,\nour opinion applies equally to all parties.\n\n                                2\n\nNot only  student-athletes, but  universities, too,  benefit from\n\nthe magic  of intercollegiate sports.   Successful teams generate\n\ntelevision   revenues   and  gate   receipts  which   often  fund\n\nsignificant   percentages  of  a  university's  overall  athletic\n\nprogram, offering  students the opportunity to  partake of sports\n\nthat   are   not  financially   self-sustaining.     Even   those\n\ninstitutions whose teams do not fill the grandstands of cavernous\n\nstadiums  or attract  national television  exposure benefit  from\n\nincreased  student  and  alumni   cohesion  and  the  support  it\n\nengenders.   Thus,  universities  nurture the  legends, great  or\n\nsmall, inhering  in their  athletic past, polishing  the hardware\n\nthat adorns field-house trophy cases and reliving heroic exploits\n\nin the pages of alumni magazines.\n\n          In these terms, Brown will never be confused with Notre\n\nDame or the  more muscular members of the Big  Ten.  Although its\n\nfootball  team did  play  in the  1916 Rose  Bowl  and its  men's\n\nbasketball  team won the  Ivy League championship  as recently as\n\n1986, Brown's  athletic  program has  only occasionally  achieved\n\nnational  prominence  or,  for  that  matter,  enjoyed  sustained\n\nsuccess.2  Moreover,  at Brown, as  at most schools, women  are a\n\nrelatively  inconspicuous part  of  the  storied  athletic  past.\n\nHistorically,  colleges limited  athletics  to  the male  sphere,\n\nleaving  those few women's  teams that  sprouted to  scrounge for\n\nresources.\n\n                    \n\n     2We note, not without a certain irony, that  the now-demoted\nwomen's   volleyball  and   gymnastics   teams  won   Ivy  League\nchampionships in 1988 and 1990, respectively.\n\n                                3\n\n          The absence  of women's  athletics at Brown  was, until\n\n1970, an ineluctable  consequence of the absence  of women; Brown\n\nsponsored a women's college   Pembroke   but did not itself admit\n\nwomen.    In 1971,  Brown  subsumed  Pembroke.    Brown  promptly\n\nupgraded Pembroke's  rather primitive athletic  offerings so that\n\nby 1977 there were fourteen women's varsity teams.  In subsequent\n\nyears, Brown  added only one distaff team:  winter track.  Hence,\n\nin  the  1991-92 academic  year,  Brown  fielded fifteen  women's\n\nvarsity teams   one fewer than the number of men's varsity teams.\n\nII.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS\n\n          In the  spring of 1991,  Brown announced that  it, like\n\nmany other schools, was in a financial bind, and that, as a belt-\n\ntightening  measure,  it planned  to  drop four  sports  from its\n\nintercollegiate varsity  athletic roster:  women's volleyball and\n\ngymnastics, men's  golf and water polo.  The University permitted\n\nthe  teams  to continue  playing  as  \"intercollegiate clubs,\"  a\n\nstatus  that allowed them  to compete against  varsity teams from\n\nother  colleges,3 but  cut  off financial  subsidies and  support\n\nservices  routinely available  to  varsity teams  (e.g., salaried\n                                                       \n\ncoaches, access  to prime  facilities,  preferred practice  time,\n\nmedical trainers, clerical  assistance, office support, admission\n\npreferences,  and the  like).   Brown estimated  that eliminating\n\n                    \n\n     3As a practical matter, many schools with varsity squads are\nreluctant  to  compete  against  club teams.    This  case  aptly\nillustrates  the point.   As  soon as  Brown demoted  its women's\nvolleyball  team  from  varsity   to  club  status,  Northeastern\nUniversity and  West Point  declined to include  Brown on  future\nvolleyball schedules.  See Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 993.\n                                \n\n                                4\n\nthese  four varsity  teams would save  $77,813 per  annum, broken\n\ndown   as  follows:     women's   volleyball,  $37,127;   women's\n\ngymnastics,  $24,901;  men's  water  polo,  $9,250;  men's  golf,\n\n$6,545.\n\n          Before the  cuts, Brown athletics  offered an aggregate\n\nof  328 varsity slots for  female athletes and  566 varsity slots\n\nfor  male  athletes.   Thus,  women  had  36.7%  of the  athletic\n\nopportunities and men  63.3%.  Abolishing the four  varsity teams\n\ntook substantially more dollars  from the women's athletic budget\n\nthan from the  men's budget,  but did not  materially affect  the\n\nathletic   opportunity  ratios;  women   retained  36.6%  of  the\n\nopportunities and men  63.4%.  At that time (and  for a number of\n\nyears    prior   thereto),   Brown's   student   body   comprised\n\napproximately 52% men and 48% women.\n\n          Following   Brown's   announcement  of   the  cutbacks,\n\ndisappointed  members of  the women's  volleyball and  gymnastics\n\nteams brought suit.  They proceeded on an implied cause of action\n\nunder Title IX, 20 U.S.C.     1681-1688 (1988).  See  Franklin v.\n                                                              \n\nGwinnett  County  Pub.  Sch.,  112  S.

The plaintiffs charged that Brown's athletic arrangements\n\nviolated  Title  IX's  ban  on  gender-based   discrimination,  a\n\nviolation that  was allegedly exacerbated by  Brown's decision to\n\n                                5\n\ndevalue the two women's  programs without first making sufficient\n\nreductions  in men's  activities or,  in the  alternative, adding\n\nother women's teams to compensate for the loss.\n\n          On plaintiffs'  motion, the district  court certified a\n\nclass of  \"all present and future Brown University women students\n\nand  potential  students  who participate,  seek  to participate,\n\nand/or   are  deterred  from   participating  in  intercollegiate\n\nathletics  funded by Brown.\"  And, after hearing fourteen days of\n\ntestimony from twenty witnesses,  the judge granted a preliminary\n\ninjunction  requiring Brown  to reinstate  the two  women's teams\n\npending the  outcome of a full  trial on the merits.   See Cohen,\n                                                                \n\n809  F. Supp.  at 1001.   We  stayed execution  of the  order and\n\nexpedited Brown's appeal.\n\nIII.  TITLE IX AND COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS\n\n          Title  IX  prohibits  gender-based   discrimination  by\n\neducational institutions receiving federal financial support   in\n\npractice,  the  vast  majority  of all  accredited  colleges  and\n\nuniversities.   The statute  sketches wide policy  lines, leaving\n\nthe details  to regulating agencies.   Since this  appeal demands\n\nthat  we  invade  terra  incognita,4  we  carefully  recount  the\n                                  \n\n                    \n\n     4Although there has been a  spate of sports-related Title IX\nsuits  during the last two  years, see Andrew  Blum, Athletics in\n                                                                 \nthe  Courts, Nat'l L.J., Apr. 5, 1993,  at 1, few have been fully\n           \nlitigated.    See, e.g.,  Carol Herwig,  Massachusetts Reinstates\n                                                                 \nWomen's  Sports, USA  Today, Oct.  22, 1992,  at 14C  (announcing\n               \nagreement to reinstate three  women's teams at the  University of\nMassachusetts and reporting the school's intention to become \"the\nfirst university in the country to come into full compliance with\nTitle IX\").   While  the case we  decide today is  apparently the\n\n                                6\n\ndevelopments  leading to the present version of Title IX and then\n\nexamine the pertinent statutory and regulatory language.\n\n                      A.  Scope of Title IX.\n                                           \n\n          At its  inception, the broad  proscriptive language  of\n\nTitle IX caused considerable consternation in the academic world.\n\nThe academy's anxiety chiefly  centered around identifying  which\n\nindividual programs,  particularly in  terms of  athletics, might\n\ncome  within  the scope  of  the  discrimination provision,  and,\n\nrelatedly, how  the government  would determine compliance.   The\n\ngridiron  fueled these  concerns:   for many  schools, the  men's\n\nfootball budget far exceeded  that of any other sport,  and men's\n\nathletics  as  a whole  received  the lion's  share  of dedicated\n\nresources   a share  that, typically, was vastly disproportionate\n\nto the percentage of men in the student body.\n\n          Part of the  confusion about  the scope  of Title  IX's\n\ncoverage  and the acceptable avenues of compliance arose from the\n\nabsence of secondary legislative materials.  Congress included no\n\ncommittee report with  the final bill  and there were  apparently\n\nonly   two  mentions  of  intercollegiate  athletics  during  the\n\ncongressional debate.  See 118 Cong. Rec. 5,807 (1972) (statement\n                          \n\nof Sen. Bayh on  privacy in athletic facilities); 117  Cong. Rec.\n\n30,407 (1971) (statement of Sen. Bayh noting  that proposed Title\n\n                    \n\nfirst  of  these  to reach  the  courts  of  appeals, others  are\npending.  See, e.g., Roberts v. Colorado State Univ., No. 93-1052\n                                                    \n(10th Cir. 1993) (not yet argued); Cook v. Colgate Univ., No. 92-\n                                                        \n9175 (2d Cir. 1993) (argued Feb. 26, 1993).\n\n                                7\n\nIX   will   not    require   gender-blended   football    teams).\n\nNevertheless,  under congressional  direction to  implement Title\n\nIX,  the  Secretary  of   Health,  Education  and  Welfare  (HEW)\n\npromulgated   regulations   in  1975   which   included  specific\n\nprovisions for college athletics.  Four years later, HEW's Office\n\nof Civil  Rights (OCR) added another layer of regulatory exegesis\n\nwhen,  after   notice  and   comment,  it  published   a  \"Policy\n\nInterpretation\"  that offered  a more  detailed measure  of equal\n\nathletic opportunity.\n\n          In  1984,  the  Supreme  Court  radically  altered  the\n\ncontemporary reading of Title  IX.  The Court held that  Title IX\n\nwas \"program-specific,\"  so that its  tenets applied only  to the\n\nprogram(s)  which actually received federal  funds and not to the\n\nrest  of the university.

Because  few athletic departments  are direct\n\nrecipients of federal funds   most federal money for universities\n\nis channelled through financial  aid offices or invested directly\n\nin  research  grants    Grove City  cabined  Title IX  and placed\n                                  \n\nvirtually all collegiate athletic programs beyond its reach.5\n\n          In  response  to  Grove  City,  Congress  scrapped  the\n                                       \n\nprogram-specific  approach  and  reinstated  an  institution-wide\n\napplication  of Title IX by  passing the Civil Rights Restoration\n\n                    \n\n     5Following the  Court's decision  in Grove City,  the United\n                                                    \nStates Department of Education  (which by then had been  spun off\nfrom HEW, see  infra Part III(C))  dropped or curtailed  seventy-\n                    \nnine  ongoing Title  IX cases.   See  Statements on  Civil Rights\n                                                                 \nRestoration  Act, Daily Lab. Rep.

The Restoration  Act\n\nrequired that if  any arm of an  educational institution received\n\nfederal  funds, the institution as a whole must comply with Title\n\nIX's provisions.  See id.; see also S. Rep. No.  64, 100th Cong.,\n                                   \n\n2d  Sess.  4  (1988),  reprinted   in  1988  U.S.C.C.A.N.  3,   6\n                                     \n\n(explaining  that  Congress  wanted  to  prohibit  discrimination\n\nthroughout an institution if the institution received any federal\n\nfunds).    Although the  Restoration  Act  does not  specifically\n\nmention  sports, the  record of  the floor  debate leaves  little\n\ndoubt that the enactment was aimed,  in part, at creating a  more\n\nlevel  playing field for female  athletes.  See,  e.g., 130 Cong.\n                                                      \n\nRec. S12,642 (daily  ed. Oct.  2, 1984) (statement  of Sen.

Riegle  noting extensive  evidence  of  sex\n\ndiscrimination in education and athletics).\n\n          The appellants  do not challenge  the district  court's\n\nfinding that, under existing  law, Brown's athletic department is\n\nsubject to Title  IX.   Accordingly, we devote  the remainder  of\n\nPart III to deterrating the meaning of Title IX, looking first at\n\nthe statute and then at the regulations.\n\n                     B.  Statutory Framework.\n                                            \n\n          Title IX, like the Restoration Act, does not explicitly\n\n                                9\n\ntreat  college  athletics.6   Rather,  the statute's  heart  is a\n\nbroad  prohibition   of   gender-based  discrimination   in   all\n\nprogrammatic aspects of educational institutions:\n\n               No person in the United States shall, on\n          the   basis   of   sex,  be   excluded   from\n          participation in, be denied the  benefits of,\n          or be subjected  to discrimination under  any\n          education   program  or   activity  receiving\n          Federal financial assistance . . . .\n\n20 U.S.C.    1681(a) (1988).   After listing  a number of  exempt\n\norganizations,  section 1681  makes  clear that,  while Title  IX\n\nprohibits  discrimination, it  does not mandate  strict numerical\n\nequality  between  the gender  balance  of  a college's  athletic\n\nprogram  and the  gender  balance of  its  student body.    Thus,\n\nsection 1681(a) shall not\n\n          be  interpreted  to  require any  educational\n          institution   to    grant   preferential   or\n          disparate treatment to the members of one sex\n          on account  of an  imbalance which  may exist\n          with  respect   to   the  total   number   or\n          percentage   of   persons    of   that    sex\n          participating in or receiving the benefits of\n          any federally supported program  or activity,\n          in   comparison  with  the  total  number  or\n          percentage of  persons  of that  sex  in  any\n          community,  State,  section,  or other  area:\n          Provided, That this  subsection shall not  be\n                  \n          construed to prevent the consideration in any\n          hearing  or proceeding under  this chapter of\n          statistical  evidence  tending  to show  that\n          such an  imbalance exists with respect to the\n          participation in, or receipt of  the benefits\n          of,  any  such  program or  activity  by  the\n          members of one sex.\n\n                    \n\n     6This lacuna apparently results from a political compromise.\nAfter the Conference Committee  deleted an amendment to  Title IX\nthat would have  exempted \"revenue-producing\" athletics, Congress\nasked the  Secretary of  HEW to provide  regulations specifically\ngoverning athletics.  See 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (1979).\n                         \n\n                                10\n\n20 U.S.C.    1681(b) (1988).  Put another  way, a court assessing\n\nTitle IX compliance may not find a violation solely because there\n                                                   \n\nis  a disparity between the gender  composition of an educational\n\ninstitution's  student constituency,  on  the one  hand, and  its\n\nathletic programs, on the other hand.\n\n          That  is not to say,  however, that evidence  of such a\n\ndisparity  is irrelevant.  Quite the contrary:  under the proviso\n\ncontained in section 1681(b), a Title IX plaintiff in an athletic\n\ndiscrimination  suit  must   accompany  statistical  evidence  of\n\ndisparate impact with  some further  evidence of  discrimination,\n\nsuch as unmet needamongst the members of thedisadvantaged gender.\n\n                    C.  Regulatory Framework.\n                                            \n\n          As we mentioned above,  the Secretary of HEW, following\n\nCongress's  instructions,  promulgated  regulations  implementing\n\nTitle IX  in the  pre-Grove City  era.  See  40 Fed.  Reg. 24,128\n                                           \n\n(1975).    Thereafter,  in  1979,  Congress split  HEW  into  the\n\nDepartment  of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department\n\nof Education  (DED).  See  20 U.S.C.     3401-3510 (1988).   In a\n                         \n\nwonderful example  of bureaucratic muddle, the  existing Title IX\n\nregulations were  left within  HHS's arsenal  while, at  the same\n\ntime,  DED  replicated  them  as  part  of  its   own  regulatory\n\narmamentarium.   Compare 45 C.F.R.    86 (1992) (HHS regulations)\n                        \n\nwith 34  C.F.R.    106 (1992) (DED  regulations).   Both sets  of\n    \n\nregulations were still in effect when the Restoration Act passed.\n\nThey  are  identical,  save  only  for  changes  in  nomenclature\n\nreflecting the reorganization of the federal bureaucracy.\n\n                                11\n\n          In short, like pretenders to the emirate of a  deceased\n\nsheik, both HHS  and DED  lay an hereditary  claim to this  oasis\n\nwhich arises  from the regulatory desert,  asserting authority to\n\nenforce  Title IX.  Nevertheless,  DED is the  principle locus of\n\nongoing  enforcement  activity.    See  20  U.S.C.     3441(a)(1)\n                                      \n\n(transferring all education functions of HEW to DED); see also 20\n                                                              \n\nU.S.C.   3441(a)(3) (transferring  education-related OCR work  to\n\nDED).

The  Regulations.   DED's  regulations  begin  by\n          1.    The  Regulations.\n                                \n\ndetailing  Title IX's  application  to college  athletics.8   The\n\nregulations also recognize, however, that an athletic program may\n\nconsist  of  gender-segregated  teams  as  long  as  one  of  two\n\nconditions is met:  either the  sport in which the team  competes\n\nis  a contact sport or the institution offers comparable teams in\n\nthe sport to both genders.  See 34 C.F.R.   106.41(b).\n                               \n\n          Finally, whether  teams are  segregated by sex  or not,\n\nthe school  must provide gender-blind equality  of opportunity to\n\nits  student  body.     The  regulations  offer  a  non-exclusive\n\ncompendium of ten  factors which OCR  will consider in  assessing\n\ncompliance with this mandate:\n\n               (1) Whether the  selection of sports and\n          levels of competition effectively accommodate\n          the  interests  and abilities  of  members of\n\n                    \n\n     8The regulations provide:\n\n          No  person shall,  on  the basis  of sex,  be\n          excluded from participation in, be denied the\n          benefits  of,  be  treated  differently  from\n          another person or otherwise  be discriminated\n          against      in      any     interscholastic,\n          intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics\n          offered  by  a  recipient,  and  no recipient\n          shall provide any  such athletics  separately\n          on such basis.\n\n34 C.F.R.   106.41(a) (1992).\n\n                                13\n\n          both sexes;\n               (2)  The  provision  of   equipment  and\n          supplies;\n               (3)  Scheduling  of  games and  practice\n          time;\n               (4) Travel and per diem allowance;\n               (5) Opportunity to receive  coaching and\n          academic tutoring;\n               (6)   Assignment  and   compensation  of\n          coaches and tutors;\n               (7) Provision of locker  rooms, practice\n          and competitive facilities;\n               (8)  Provision  of medical  and training\n          facilities and services;\n               (9)  Provision  of  housing  and  dining\n          facilities and services;\n               (10) Publicity.\n\n34 C.F.R.    106.41(c) (1992).9   The district  court rested  its\n\npreliminary  injunction  on  the  first of  these  ten  areas  of\n\ninquiry:     Brown's  failure  effectively   to  accommodate  the\n\ninterests  and abilities of female  students in the selection and\n\nlevel of sports.   See Cohen, 809 F.  Supp. at 994.  Hence,  this\n                            \n\narea  is the  most critical  in terms  of evaluating  the charges\n\nagainst  Brown  (although  it  is  also  the  most  difficult  to\n\nmeasure).\n\n          2.  The Policy Interpretation.  In the three years next\n          2.

In order to encourage  self-policing and thereby\n\nwinnow complaints, HEW proposed a Policy Interpretation.   See 43\n                                                              \n\nFed.

The parties\n\nare in agreement  that, at  DED's birth, it  clutched the  Policy\n\nInterpretation, and,  as a practical  matter, that appears  to be\n\nthe case.10   See, e.g., DED,  Title IX Athletics  Investigator's\n                                                                 \n\nManual  1, 2  (1990)  (Manual); see  also  Complaint Letter  from\n                                         \n\nRegional Civil  Rights Director,  DED, to Dr.  Martin Massengale,\n\nChancellor, Univ. of  Nebraska (July 10,  1989) (noting that  DED\n\n\"ha[s]   followed   the   directions  provided   in   the  Policy\n\nInterpretation\");  Complaint Letter  from  Regional Civil  Rights\n\nDirector, DED, to  Dr. Charles  A. Walker,  Chancellor, Univ.  of\n\nArkansas (Sept. 1, 1989) (same).  Although we can  find no record\n\nthat DED  formally adopted the  Policy Interpretation, we  see no\n\npoint to splitting the hair, particularly where the parties  have\n\nnot  asked us to  do so.

Because the third compliance area delineates\n\nthis  heartland, we agree with  the district courts  that have so\n\nruled and hold that,  with regard to the effective  accommodation\n\n                    \n\n     11The  Manual divides Title IX coverage  into the same three\nareas and notes  that \"an  investigation may be  limited to  less\nthan all three of these major areas.\"  Manual at 7.\n\n                                16\n\nof students' interests and  abilities, an institution can violate\n\nTitle  IX  even  if  it  meets  the  \"financial  assistance\"  and\n\n\"athletic equivalence\" standards.

In  surveying  the dimensions  of this\n\nbattleground, that  is, whether an  athletic program  effectively\n\naccommodates   students'  interests  and  abilities,  the  Policy\n\nInterpretation  maps   a  trinitarian   model  under  which   the\n\nuniversity must meet at least one of three benchmarks:\n\n               (1)   Whether   intercollegiate    level\n          participation  opportunities   for  male  and\n          female  students  are  provided   in  numbers\n          substantially    proportionate    to    their\n          respective enrollments; or\n               (2) Where  the members  of one  sex have\n          been    and   are    underrepresented   among\n          intercollegiate    athletes,   whether    the\n          institution can show a history and continuing\n          practice  of  program   expansion  which   is\n          demonstrably  responsive  to  the  developing\n\n                    \n\n     12In any  event, both the financial  assistance and athletic\nequivalence standards are inapposite for present purposes.  As to\nthe former,  Brown does not confer athletic  scholarships and the\nplaintiffs do not allege  that Brown has discriminated by  gender\nin  distributing  other financial  aid.   As  to the  latter, the\ndistrict court made only preliminary findings,  see Cohen, 809 F.\n                                                         \nSupp.  at 994-97,  on  the explicit  understanding that  it would\nrevisit compliance vel non with the athletic equivalence standard\n                          \nat trial.

Reg.  at 71,418.   The first benchmark  furnishes a safe\n\nharbor  for those  institutions  that  have distributed  athletic\n\nopportunities  in numbers  \"substantially  proportionate\" to  the\n\ngender composition  of their student bodies.   Thus, a university\n\nwhich does  not wish to  engage in extensive  compliance analysis\n\nmay stay  on the  sunny side of  Title IX  simply by  maintaining\n\ngender parity between its student body and its athletic lineup.\n\n          The second  and third  parts of the  accommodation test\n\nrecognize  that  there  are   circumstances  under  which,  as  a\n\npractical matter,  something short  of this proportionality  is a\n\nsatisfactory proxy for gender balance.  For example, so long as a\n\nuniversity is continually expanding athletic opportunities in  an\n\nongoing effort to meet the  needs of the underrepresented gender,\n\nand persists in this  approach as interest and ability  levels in\n\nits student body and secondary feeder schools rise, benchmark two\n\nis  satisfied and Title IX  does not require  that the university\n\nleap  to complete  gender parity  in a  single bound.   Or,  if a\n\nschool has a student body  in which one sex is demonstrably  less\n\ninterested in  athletics,  Title IX  does  not require  that  the\n\n                                18\n\nschool  create   teams  for,   or  rain  money   upon,  otherwise\n\ndisinterested students; rather, the  third benchmark is satisfied\n\nif the underrepresented sex's discernible interests are fully and\n\neffectively accommodated.13\n\n          It seems unlikely, even  in this day and age,  that the\n\nathletic  establishments  of   many  coeducational   universities\n\nreflect   the   gender   balance  of   their   student  bodies.14\n\nSimilarly, the recent boom in Title IX suits suggests that, in an\n\nera of  fiscal austerity,  few universities  are prone  to expand\n\nathletic opportunities.  It is not surprising, then, that schools\n\nmore often than not attempt  to manage the rigors of Title  IX by\n\nsatisfying the  interests and abilities  of the  underrepresented\n\ngender,   that  is,  by  meeting   the  third  benchmark  of  the\n\naccommodation  test.  Yet,  this benchmark sets  a high standard:\n\nit demands  not merely some accommodation, but full and effective\n\n                    \n\n     13OCR also lists a series of illustrative justifications for\nthe  disparate treatment  of  men's and  women's athletic  teams,\nincluding (1) sports  that require more resources  because of the\nnature of the game (e.g.,  contact sports generally require  more\n                        \nequipment),  (2)  special circumstances,  such  as  an influx  of\nfirst-year players, that may require an extraordinary infusion of\nresources,  (3) special operational expenses (e.g., crowd control\n                                                  \nat  a  basketball tournament),  as  long  as special  operational\nexpense needs  are  met  for  both genders  and  (4)  affirmative\nmeasures to remedy past limitations on athletic opportunities for\none gender.  44 Fed.

If there is sufficient interest and ability among\n\nmembers of the statistically  underrepresented gender, not slaked\n\nby existing programs, an institution necessarily fails this prong\n\nof the test.\n\n          Although the  full-and-effective-accommodation standard\n\nis  high,  it  is   not  absolute.    Even  when   male  athletic\n\nopportunities  outnumber female  athletic opportunities,  and the\n\nuniversity  has   not  met   the  first   benchmark  (substantial\n\nstatistical proportionality) or  the second benchmark (continuing\n\nprogram expansion) of the accommodation test, the mere fact  that\n\nthere are some  female students  interested in a  sport does  not\n\nipso facto require the school to provide a varsity team in  order\n          \n\nto  comply with the third benchmark.  Rather, the institution can\n\nsatisfy   the   third   benchmark   by   ensuring   participatory\n\nopportunities  at  the intercollegiate  level  when,  and to  the\n\nextent that, there is \"sufficient interest  and ability among the\n\nmembers  of the  excluded  sex to  sustain  a viable  team and  a\n\nreasonable  expectation of  intercollegiate competition  for that\n\nteam .  . . .\"   44 Fed. Reg. at  71,418.  Staying on  top of the\n\nproblem is not sport for the short-winded:   the institution must\n\nremain   vigilant,   \"upgrading  the   competitive  opportunities\n\navailable to  the historically disadvantaged sex  as warranted by\n\ndeveloping abilities among the athletes of that  sex,\" id., until\n                                                          \n\nthe opportunities for, and  levels of, competition are equivalent\n\n                                20\n\nby gender.15\n\n          Brown   argues   that   DED's  Policy   Interpretation,\n\nconstrued  as we have  just outlined, goes so  far afield that it\n\ncountervails the  enabling legislation.  Brown  suggests that, to\n\nthe extent students' interests in athletics are  disproportionate\n\nby  gender, colleges  should be  allowed to meet  those interests\n\nincompletely  as  long  as the  school's  response  is in  direct\n\nproportion to the  comparative levels of interest.   Put bluntly,\n\nBrown reads the \"full\" out of the duty to accommodate  \"fully and\n\neffectively.\"      It   argues   instead  that   an   institution\n\nsatisfactorily  accommodates  female  athletes  if  it  allocates\n\nathletic  opportunities to women in accordance  with the ratio of\n                                                                 \n\ninterested and able  women to interested and able men, regardless\n                                                     \n\nof the number of unserved women or the  percentage of the student\n\nbody that they comprise.\n\n          Because  this is  mountainous terrain,  an example  may\n\nserve to clarify the distinction between Brown's proposal and our\n\nunderstanding of the law.   Suppose a university (Oooh U.)  has a\n\nstudent body  consisting of 1,000 men  and 1,000 women, a  one to\n\none ratio.   If 500  men and  250 women are  able and  interested\n\n                    \n\n     15If  in  the  course  of  adding  and  upgrading  teams,  a\nuniversity attains gender parity between its athletic program and\nits  student   body,  it  meets   the  first  benchmark   of  the\naccommodation test.  But, Title IX does not require that a school\npour ever-increasing sums into its athletic establishment.  If  a\nuniversity  prefers to  take  another route,  it  can also  bring\nitself  into   compliance  with   the  first  benchmark   of  the\naccommodation test  by subtraction  and downgrading, that  is, by\nreducing  opportunities  for  the  overrepresented  gender  while\nkeeping opportunities stable for the underrepresented gender  (or\nreducing them to a much lesser extent).\n\n                                21\n\nathletes,  the ratio of interested men to interested women is two\n\nto one.   Brown takes  the position that  both the actual  gender\n\ncomposition of  the  student  body  and whether  there  is  unmet\n\ninterest among  the  underrepresented gender  are irrelevant;  in\n\norder to satisfy the  third benchmark, Oooh U. must  only provide\n\nathletic  opportunities in  line with  the two to  one interested\n\nathlete  ratio, say,  100 slots for  men and 50  slots for women.\n\nUnder this view, the interest  of 200 women would be unmet    but\n\nthere would be no Title IX violation.\n\n          We  think  that  Brown's  perception of  the  Title  IX\n\nuniverse  is myopic.  The fact that the overrepresented gender is\n\nless than fully accommodated will not, in and of itself, excuse a\n\nshortfall   in   the   provision   of   opportunities   for   the\n\nunderrepresented gender.  Rather, the  law requires that, in  the\n\nabsence of continuing program  expansion (benchmark two), schools\n\neither meet benchmark one  by providing athletic opportunities in\n\nproportion to the gender composition of the student body (in Oooh\n\nU.'s case, a roughly equal number  of slots for men and women, as\n\nthe  student body is equally divided), or meet benchmark three by\n\nfully    accommodating    interested    athletes     among    the\n\nunderrepresented  sex  (providing,  at  Oooh U.,  250  slots  for\n\nwomen).16\n\n                    \n\n     16Of  course, if Oooh U. takes the benchmark three route, it\nwill also have to provide  at least the same number of  slots for\nmen; but, so long as women remain the underrepresented gender and\ntheir  interests  are  fully  accommodated,  the  university  can\nprovide as many (or as  few) additional slots for men as  it sees\nfit.\n\n                                22\n\n          In  the final  analysis, Brown's view  is wrong  on two\n\nscores.   It  is wrong  as  a matter  of  law, for  DED's  Policy\n\nInterpretation,   which  requires   full  accommodation   of  the\n\nunderrepresented gender,  draws  its essence  from  the  statute.\n\nWhether  Brown's concept  might  be thought  more attractive,  or\n\nwhether  we, if  writing  on a  pristine  page, would  craft  the\n\nregulation  in a manner different  than the agency,  are not very\n\nimportant considerations.  Because  the agency's rendition stands\n\nupon a plausible, if not inevitable, reading of Title IX,  we are\n\nobligated  to enforce the regulation according to its tenor.  See\n                                                                 \n\nChevron, 467 U.S.  at 843 n.11  (holding that  a \"court need  not\n       \n\nconclude  that  the  agency  construction  was  the  only one  it\n\npermissibly could  have  adopted  to  uphold  [it]\")  (collecting\n\ncases); Massachusetts v.

It  proceeds from the premise that  the agency's\n\nthird  benchmark countervails  Title  IX.   But, this  particular\n\nimprecation of  the third benchmark  overlooks the  accommodation\n\ntest's  general purpose:  to determine whether a student has been\n\n\"excluded from participation in, [or] denied the benefits  of\" an\n\nathletic  program \"on  the basis  of sex .  . .  .\"   20 U.S.C.  \n\n1681(a).

Given that the survey of  interests and abilities\n\nwould begin under circumstances where men's athletic teams have a\n\nconsiderable head start, such a rule would almost certainly blunt\n\nthe  exhortation  that  schools  should \"take  into  account  the\n\nnationally increasing levels of women's  interests and abilities\"\n\nand avoid \"disadvantag[ing] members  of an underrepresented sex .\n\n. . .\"  44 Fed. Reg. at 71,417.\n\n          Brown's    proposal    would    also   aggravate    the\n\nquantification problems  that are inevitably bound  up with Title\n\nIX.   Student plaintiffs, who  carry the burden  of proof on this\n\nissue, as well as  universities monitoring self-compliance, would\n\nbe required  to assess the level of interest in both the male and\n\nfemale  student  populations   and  determine  comparatively  how\n\ncompletely the university was serving the interests of each  sex.\n\nBy contrast, as we read the accommodation test's third benchmark,\n\nit requires  a relatively simple  assessment of whether  there is\n\nunmet need in the  underrepresented gender that rises to  a level\n\nsufficient to warrant a new team or the upgrading of an  existing\n\nteam.  We think the simpler reading is far more serviceable.\n\n          Furthermore, by moving away from OCR's third benchmark,\n\nwhich focuses on the levels of interest and ability extant in the\n\n                                24\n\nstudent body,  Brown's theory invites thorny questions  as to the\n\nappropriate  survey  population,  whether  from  the  university,\n\ntypical  feeder schools, or the regional community.  In that way,\n\nBrown's  proposal would  do  little more  than overcomplicate  an\n\nalready complex equation.\n\n          We will  not paint the  lily.  Brown's  approach cannot\n\nwithstand  scrutiny  on  either  legal  or policy  grounds.    We\n\nconclude that  DED's Policy Interpretation means  exactly what it\n\nsays.  This plain  meaning is a proper, permissible  rendition of\n\nthe statute.\n\nIV.  THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE\n\n          We  turn  now  to  a series  of  case-specific  issues,\n\nstarting with Brown's  constitutional challenge to  the statutory\n\nscheme.\n\n                      A.  Equal Protection.\n                                          \n\n          Brown  asseverates  that  if  the  third  part  of  the\n\naccommodation test  is read as OCR wrote it   to require full and\n\neffective accommodation of the underrepresented gender   the test\n\nviolates the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  We think\n\nnot.\n\n          Brown  assumes that  full  and effective  accommodation\n\ndisadvantages  male  athletes.17   While  it might  well  be that\n\n                    \n\n     17In  characterizing  Title IX  as  benefitting only  women,\n                                                         \nBrown takes a rather isthmian view  of the world at large.  After\nall,  colleges   that  have  converted  from  exclusively  female\nenrollment to coeducational enrollment face situations inverse to\nBrown's.  In such a setting, the men's athletic program  may well\nbe  underdeveloped,   or  underfunded,  or   both,  while  fiscal\nretrenchment  offers no  reprieve.    Under these  circumstances,\n\n                                25\n\nmore  men than women at Brown are currently interested in sports,\n\nBrown points to no evidence  in the record that men are  any more\n\nlikely to  engage in  athletics than women,  absent socialization\n\nand  disparate  opportunities.   In  the  absence  of  any  proof\n\nsupporting  Brown's  claim,  and  in view  of  congressional  and\n\nadministrative urging  that women,  given  the opportunity,  will\n\nnaturally participate in athletics in numbers equal to men, we do\n\nnot find  that  the regulation,  when  read in  the  common-sense\n\nmanner  that its  language  suggests, see  supra Part  III(C)(3),\n                                                \n\noffends the Fifth Amendment.\n\n          What is more, even if we were to assume, for argument's\n\nsake, that the regulation creates a gender classification slanted\n\nsomewhat  in  favor of  women,  we would  find  no constitutional\n\ninfirmity.  It is clear that Congress has  broad powers under the\n\nFifth Amendment  to remedy past discrimination.

We reject\n\nthe suggestion.\n\n          In our view, there  is no need to search  for analogies\n\nwhere,  as in the Title  IX milieu, the  controlling statutes and\n\nregulations  are clear.  To  invoke the prophylaxis  of Title IX,\n\nthe  statute, 20  U.S.C.    1681(b),  and  the regulations,  read\n\ntogether, require a Title IX plaintiff to show disparity  between\n\nthe gender composition of the  institution's student body and its\n\nathletic   program,    thereby   proving   that   there   is   an\n\nunderrepresented gender.   Then, the plaintiff  must show that  a\n\nsecond element   unmet  interest   is  present.  In other  words,\n\nthe plaintiff must prove that the underrepresented gender has not\n\nbeen \"fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.\"\n\n44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418.   If the plaintiff carries the  devoir of\n\n                                28\n\npersuasion  on these two elements, she has proven her case unless\n\nthe university shows,  as an affirmative defense,  \"a history and\n\ncontinuing practice of  program expansion  which is  demonstrably\n\nresponsive  to  the developing  interests  and  abilities of  the\n\nmembers\" of the underrepresented gender.  Id.\n                                             \n\n          Over and beyond the  express dictates of the applicable\n\nstatute  and  regulations,  there  is another  valid  reason  for\n\neschewing the  Title VII paradigm  in most  Title IX cases.

In this\n                \n\ncase,  the  district  court  paid  meticulous  attention  to  the\n\nparties' prospects for  success over  the long haul.   The  court\n\nplainly  visualized  both  the  factual   intricacies  and  legal\n\ncomplexities that  characterize Title IX  litigation.  It  held a\n\nlengthy  adversary   hearing  and  reviewed   voluminous  written\n\nsubmissions.  And at  journey's end, it correctly focused  on the\n\nthree-part accommodation test.\n\n          The court faultlessly dispatched the first two elements\n\nof  the test.   With  respect to  the comparison  between Brown's\n\nathletic  agenda and  student body,  we  adopt the  lower court's\n\nrecord-rooted  finding that the University did not meet   or even\n\nclosely  approach    the \"substantial  proportionality\" threshold\n\nbecause  it offered too few varsity opportunities for women.  See\n                                                                 \n\nCohen, 809  F. Supp.  at 991.   Cognizant, perhaps, that  the raw\n     \n\nnumbers tell an  unambiguous tale, Brown  does not challenge  the\n\ninviolability of this finding.\n\n          As  to the  test's second  part, the court  below found\n\nthat, although Brown  could point to  \"impressive growth\" in  its\n\nwomen's athletic  program  in  the  1970s,  the  school  had  not\n\n                                32\n\ncontinued  filling the gap during the next  two decades.  Id.  On\n                                                             \n\nthis  basis, the  court  concluded that  Brown  had not  met  the\n\nbenchmark.  See id.  Brown asserts that  the district court erred\n                   \n\nby not crediting  it sufficiently for  its dramatic expansion  of\n\nwomen's   sports  in  the   1970s,  and   we  are   not  entirely\n\nunsympathetic  to this plea.  In the last analysis, however, this\n\nwas  a judgment  call  and the  trial  court's judgment  was  not\n\nunreasonable.   While a university deserves  appreciable applause\n\nfor  supercharging a  low-voltage athletic  program in  one burst\n\nrather  than powering  it  up  over  a  longer  period,  such  an\n\nenergization,   once  undertaken,  does   not  forever  hold  the\n\ninstitution harmless.  Here, Brown labored for six years to weave\n\na broad array of new activities into the fabric of its palestrian\n\nofferings.  The district court apparently believed, however, that\n\nBrown  then rested on its  laurels for at  least twice that long.\n\nThe very length of this hiatus  suggests something far short of a\n\ncontinuing  practice  of program  expansion.    And, moreover,  a\n          \n\nuniversity must design expansion in whatever form and at whatever\n\npace to respond  to the  flux and reflux  of unserved  interests.\n\nThe court  below found that Brown  failed in this task.   See id.\n                                                                 \n\nThe  issue  of  responsiveness  is  fact-intensive  and  in  most\n\ninstances, as  here, its  resolution will  be within the  trier's\n\nprovince.  We find  no error, therefore, in the  district court's\n\nresolution of the second aspect of the accommodation test.\n\n          The  third  benchmark   presents  a  more   problematic\n\nscenario.   The district  court incorrectly held  that Brown bore\n\n                                33\n\nthe  burden  of  showing  that  it  had  fully  and   effectively\n\naccommodated the  interests and abilities of  its women athletes.\n\nSee  id. at 997.   Section 1681(b) requires  that the plaintiffs,\n        \n\nrather than the  University, prove  a shortfall in  the full  and\n\neffective accommodation of interested female athletes by showing,\n\ninitially,  both numerical  disparity  and unmet  interest.   See\n                                                                 \n\nsupra Part  V.   Nonetheless, we  do not think  that the  court's\n     \n\nbevue is  fatal.  Even  when a  trial court has  misconstrued the\n\nlaw, an appellate tribunal  may avoid remanding if the  record is\n\nsufficiently  developed  and the  facts  necessary  to shape  the\n\nproper legal matrix  are sufficiently clear.

Although the full and  effective\n\naccommodation of athletic interests is likely to be a complicated\n\nissue where allegedly underrepresented  plaintiffs sue to force a\n\nuniversity  to create a neoteric team or  upgrade the status of a\n\nclub team,  see,  e.g., Cook,  802  F.  Supp. at  737,  there  is\n                            \n\nunlikely  to be any comparably turbid question as to interest and\n\n                                34\n\nability  where,  as  here,   plaintiffs  are  seeking  merely  to\n\nforestall the interment of healthy varsity teams.\n\n          In  this  instance,  the  district  court's  subsidiary\n\nfindings  of  fact render  it  beyond cavil  that  the plaintiffs\n\ncarried their burden  of proof.   The court  found, for  example,\n\nthat there was \"great interest and talent\" amongst Brown's female\n\nundergraduates  which,  following  the cuts,  would  go unserved.\n\nCohen, 809 F. Supp. at 992.  Of particular moment, the court also\n     \n\nfound  the interest and talent on campus ample to support women's\n\nvarsity volleyball and gymnastics teams, see id.   a finding that\n                                                \n\nis hardly surprising in  view of the teams' robust  health before\n\nthe  budget-cutters arrived on the scene.  The court proceeded to\n\nnote that, while  club teams can be equivalent to intercollegiate\n\nteams when they regularly participate in varsity competition, see\n                                                                 \n\n44 Fed. Reg. at 71,413 n.1, the teams that Brown downgraded would\n\nnot regularly be competing against varsity teams and would suffer\n\na  diminution  of status  in a  wide  range of  other significant\n\nrespects.  See Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 992-93.\n                    \n\n          The potency  of this evidence is  an effective antidote\n\nto the district  court's partial misapplication of  the burden of\n\nproof.   Because the record  contains nothing that  would allow a\n\ntrier to find that Brown's athletic agenda reflects the makeup of\n\nits  student  body  or that  the  plaintiff  class  is so  poorly\n\npopulated as  to warrant  a reduction  in  women's sports,21  the\n\n                    \n\n     21It  bears mentioning  in  this regard  that Judge  Pettine\nheard, and  apparently credited, evidence  indicating that  there\nwere  other  women's  club teams  sufficiently  accomplished  and\n\n                                35\n\ncourt's  error was harmless.   In a nutshell,  the plaintiffs met\n\ntheir challenge on parts one and three of the accommodation test.\n\nThis  conclusion,  in  partnership  with   the  district  court's\n\nsupportable finding that Brown did not satisfactorily demonstrate\n\na continuing  expansion of  its women's athletic  lineup, strikes\n\nthe gold.  The court's prediction of plaintiffs' probable success\n\nwas, therefore, adequately grounded.\n\n                     B.  Irreparable Injury.\n                                           \n\n          The  next area  of inquiry  is irreparable  harm.   The\n\ndistrict court  heard from  a variety of  athletic administration\n\nexperts.  The court concluded that, absent judicial intervention,\n\nthe plaintiffs would suffer irremediable injury in at least three\n\nrespects:    competitive   posture,  recruitment,  and   loss  of\n\ncoaching.   As  club teams,  the district  court thought  women's\n\nvolleyball   and  gymnastics   would  increasingly   become  less\n\ncompetitive, have  fewer players,  be unable to  schedule varsity\n\nteams from other schools,  become unattractive to potential stars\n\nmaking college  choices, and suffer  stagnation in the  growth of\n\nindividual talent due to  the absence of coaching.22   See Cohen,\n                                                                \n\n809 F. Supp.  at 992-93.   Certainly, these harms  exist to  some\n\ndegree.  In highly nuanced cases involving a melange of competing\n\n                    \n\npopulated to flourish as varsity squads.

Here, the district court specifically found that if the\ngymnastics team  was downgraded to  club status, it  would likely\nlose  its paid coach when  her contract expired  in June of 1993.\nCohen, 809 F.

Although the types of harms\n\nthe court  catalogued might  not all  rise to the  same level  of\n\nseriousness, the overall record supports, even though it does not\n\ncompel,  the court's  assessment  of  their cumulative  severity.\n\nGiven,  especially,  the  lack  of any  other  concinnous  remedy\n\npendente  lite, we  will  not second-guess  the district  court's\n              \n\nfinding of irreparable injury.\n\n                    C.  The Balance of Harms.\n                                            \n\n          Finally, the  district court  found that the  competing\n\nequities weighed  in favor  of granting  the  injunction.   After\n\nhearing testimony  from Brown's Financial Vice-President  and its\n\nAssociate Athletic Director,  the district  court concluded  that\n\nthe cost  of the interim  injunction would be  relatively slight;\n\nand that, in view of discretionary funds already contained in the\n\nAthletic Department budget and a presidential \"contingency fund,\"\n\nBrown possessed the wherewithal to defray the costs without undue\n\nhardship.  See Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 1000-01.   By contrast, the\n                    \n\ncourt noted  the volleyball  and gymnastics  programs' continuing\n\ndeterioration in the aftermath  of the demotion.  See id. at 992-\n                                                         \n\n93.  On balance,  the court determined that the  financial burden\n\non  Brown was tolerable, and,  in any event,  was overbalanced by\n\n                                37\n\nthe potential harm to  the plaintiff class  if the court took  no\n\naction.\n\n          Brown  contests the  results of  this balancing  on the\n\npremise that the district  court wrongly discounted the testimony\n\nof  one  of its  witnesses and  did  not adequately  consider the\n\npossibility  that false  hopes might  be raised by  a preliminary\n\ninjunction.  It  is, however,  axiomatic that  a district  court,\n\nsitting  without a jury, may selectively discount testimony as it\n\nweighs  conflicting viewpoints  and adjudicates  the facts.

Hence,\n\nthe  risk  that  some  observers  might  read  into  a  temporary\n\nrestrainer more than it  eventually proves to mean is  endemic to\n\nthe equitable device and cannot tip the scales against its use in\n\nany particular  circumstance.  It  defies elemental logic  to say\n\nthat parties  who the court has determined  will probably succeed\n\nat trial should  be denied the  interim relief to which  they are\n\nentitled because  their ultimate victory is  less than absolutely\n\ncertain.\n\n          In  fine,  the district  court  did  not overspill  its\n\ndiscretion either  in taking Brown's  self-interested description\n\nof  its financial plight with a grain  of salt or in limiting the\n\nrole that  raising  false  hopes  might  play  in  the  equitable\n\n                                38\n\ncalculus.\n\n                         D.  Summing Up.\n                                       \n\n          We summarize succinctly, beginning with the probability\n\nof  plaintiffs' success.  In an era where the practices of higher\n\neducation must  adjust to stunted revenues,  careening costs, and\n\nchanging  demographics, colleges  might well  be obliged  to curb\n\nspending  on programs,  like athletics,  that do  not lie  at the\n\nepicenter  of their  institutional mission.    Title IX  does not\n\npurport to  override financial  necessity.   Yet, the  pruning of\n\nathletic  budgets  cannot  take  place  solely  in  comptrollers'\n\noffices, isolated from the legislative and regulatory imperatives\n\nthat Title IX imposes.\n\n          This case aptly illustrates the point.  Brown earnestly\n\nprofesses that it has done  no more than slash women's and  men's\n\nathletics by  approximately the same degree, and, indeed, the raw\n\nnumbers lend  partial credence to that  characterization.23  But,\n\nBrown's claim overlooks the shortcomings that plagued its program\n\nbefore it took  blade in hand.  If a  school, like Brown, eschews\n\nthe first  two benchmarks of the accommodation  test, electing to\n\nstray from  substantial  proportionality  and  failing  to  march\n\nuninterruptedly in the direction  of equal athletic  opportunity,\n\nit must  comply with the third  benchmark.  To do  so, the school\n\n                    \n\n     23We note, however,  that while the  cuts proposed by  Brown\neliminate a  roughly equal  number of athletic  opportunities for\nwomen as for  men, those  cuts subtract roughly  four times  more\nmoney  from  the budget  for  female pancratiasts  than  from the\nbudget for their male counterparts.   See supra pp. 4-5.  And, as\n                                               \na noted playwright once observed, \"where there is no money, there\nis no change of any kind.\"  Moss Hart, Act One (1959).\n                                              \n\n                                39\n\nmust  fully  and  effectively  accommodate  the  underrepresented\n\ngender's interests  and abilities,  even if  that requires  it to\n\ngive  the  underrepresented gender  (in  this  case, women)  what\n\namounts  to a  larger slice  of a  shrinking athletic-opportunity\n\npie.\n\n          The record  reveals that the  court below paid  heed to\n\nthese realities.  It  properly recognized that even  balanced use\n\nof the budget-paring knife runs afoul of Title IX where, as here,\n\nthe  fruits  of  a  university's  athletic  program  remain  ill-\n\ndistributed after the trimming takes place.  Because the district\n\ncourt understood this principle, and because its findings of fact\n\nas to  the  case's  probable  outcome are  based  on  substantial\n\nevidence, the court's determination that plaintiffs are likely to\n\nsucceed on the merits is inexpugnable.\n\n          The  district  court  displayed  similar  dexterity  in\n\ntouching the other three bases en  route to a grant of injunctive\n\nrelief:    irreparability  of  injury,  the  relative  weight  of\n\npotential  harms, and impact on  the public interest.   The court\n\nfound that  the harm  to  the plaintiff  class was  irremediable,\n\nabsent  prompt  injunctive  relief;  that the  balance  of  harms\n\nfavored such relief; and that the overriding public  interest lay\n\nin the firm enforcement of Title IX.   In each of these areas, as\n\nin  the  likelihood-of-success  arena,   the  court  made  serial\n\nfindings  that, taken  at  face value,  amply justify  injunctive\n\nrelief.  Because these findings derive  adequate support from the\n\nrecord, the court's  decree must  stand as long  as the  specific\n\n                                40\n\nrelief the court ordered  was appropriate.   It is to this  issue\n\nthat we now turn.\n\nVII.  REMEDIATION\n\n          After applying the preliminary injunction standard, the\n\ndistrict   court  ordered   relief  pendente   lite,  temporarily\n                                                   \n\nreinstating the  women's volleyball and gymnastics  teams.  Brown\n\nargues  that such  specific  relief is  inappropriate because  it\n\nintrudes on Brown's discretion.  The  point has some cogency.  We\n\nare a society that cherishes academic freedom and recognizes that\n\nuniversities  deserve great  leeway  in their  operations.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Wynne v. Tufts Univ.

In  addition,\n           \n\nTitle  IX does not  require institutions  to fund  any particular\n\nnumber or type of athletic opportunities   only that they provide\n\nthose opportunities  in a nondiscriminatory fashion  if they wish\n\nto receive federal funds.\n\n          Nonetheless, the district court has broad discretionary\n\npower to take provisional steps restoring the status quo  pending\n\nthe conclusion of a trial.  See Ricci v. Okin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593907\"><a href=\"/opinion/593907/robert-simpson-ricci-v-robert-l-okin-md-william-f-weld-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir. 1992); Guilbert, 934 F.2d  at 7 &amp; n.3.  Considering the\n                         \n\ndistrict court's  proper estimation  and deft application  of the\n\npreliminary injunction standard, see supra Part VI, we think that\n                                          \n\nrequiring Brown to maintain the women's volleyball and gymnastics\n\nteams in varsity status for  the time being is a remedial  choice\n\nwithin  the district  court's discretion.   That  is not  to say,\n\n                                41\n\nhowever, that the same remedy will be suitable at trial's end  if\n\nthe Title IX charges prove out against Brown.  The district court\n\nhas noted, we believe appropriately, that if it  ultimately finds\n\nBrown's  athletic program to violate  Title IX, it will initially\n\nrequire the University to propose  a compliance plan rather  than\n\nmandate the  creation or  deletion of particular  athletic teams.\n\nCohen, 809 F. Supp. at 1001.  Although the district court has the\n     \n\npower to  order  specific relief  if  the institution  wishes  to\n\ncontinue receiving  federal funds,  see Franklin,  112 S.  Ct. at\n                                                \n\n1035, the many routes to Title IX compliance make specific relief\n\nmost useful in situations where the institution, after a judicial\n\ndetermination of noncompliance,  demonstrates an unwillingness or\n\ninability to exercise its discretion in a way that brings it into\n\ncompliance with Title IX.\n\nVIII.  CONCLUSION\n\n          We need go  no further.   This  litigation presents  an\n\narray  of complicated and important issues at a crossroads of the\n\nlaw that few  courts have explored.  The beacon  by which we must\n\nsteer is  Congress's unmistakably clear  mandate that educational\n\ninstitutions  not use  federal monies to  perpetuate gender-based\n\ndiscrimination.   At the same  time, we must  remain sensitive to\n\nthe fact that  suits of  this genre implicate  the discretion  of\n\nuniversities  to pursue  their  missions  free from  governmental\n\ninterference and,  in the bargain, to  deploy increasingly scarce\n\nresources in  the most  advantageous way.   These considerations,\n\neach of which is in service to desirable ends, are necessarily in\n\n                                42\n\ntension in Title IX cases.  Thus, there are unlikely  to be ideal\n\nsolutions  to  all the  vexing  problems  that might  potentially\n\narise.\n\n          This   appeal  exemplifies  many  of  the  difficulties\n\ninherent in Title IX litigation.   We do not presume to  say that\n\nthe  district court's interim solution is perfect, but it is fair\n\nand  it  is  lawful.    On  the  record  compiled  to  date,  the\n\npreliminary injunction  requiring Brown to reinstate  its women's\n\nvolleyball  and gymnastics  teams for  the time  being came  well\n\nwithin  the encincture  of  judicial  discretion.   We  will  not\n\nmeddle. \n\n          The preliminary  injunction is affirmed,  the temporary\n                                                                 \n\nstay  is dissolved,  and the  cause is  remanded to  the district\n                                                                 \n\ncourt for further proceedings.  Costs to appellees.\n                                                  \n\n                                43\n</pre>",
