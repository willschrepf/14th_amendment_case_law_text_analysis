We agree that on its face section 11.051 (a-1) could be construed to alter how the majority vote of a school board is determined. But it is not clear from the text of section 11.051(a-l) that the Legislature intended to abrogate the common law with respect to the majority vote requirement.

The purpose, circumstances of enactment, and the legislative history indicate to us that the Legislature intended House Bill 2563 to better define the role of a school board trustee and to segregate the board's role and duties from those of the superintendent, particularly with respect to governance and management duties.
