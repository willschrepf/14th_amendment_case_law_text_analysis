DIBI A Air Jireh Service A/KlAI\n\nAir Jireh Services (herein \"Air Jireh\") and Oskar Sepulveda, Jr. (herein \"Sepulveda\") file this\n\nbrief asking the Court to reverse the Order of the trial court against AJS Corp., Air Jireh, and\n\nSepulveda (herein collectively \"Appellants\"). Appellants respectfully show that prior to the\n\nfiling of this brief, Appellant Sepulveda, filed a Notice of Bankruptcy in this Court. As such, in\n\norder to not violate the Stay as to Sepulveda, Appellants continue the references to Sepulveda in\n\nthis brief only for purposes of continuity in Appellant AJS Corp. And Air Jireh's argument and\n\nnot to assert any relief in violation of the Bankruptcy Stay.\n\n                                 STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n       This is an appeal from the February 2,2015 trial concerning Plaintiff, Weaver and &\n\nJacobs (herein \"Weaver & Jacobs \") claims of Breach of Contract, Promissory Estoppel, and\n\nViolation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act against AJS Corp. and claims of Fraud and\n\nNegligent Misrepresentation against Sepulveda.\n\n       Weaver & Jacobs filed an original petition against AJS Corp. for Breach of Contract and\n\nPromissory Estoppel on or about October 3, 2013. AJS Corp. filed an Original Answer on\n\nOctober December 2,2013.      Weaver and Jacobs then filed a Second Amended Petition on\n\nJanuary 22, 2014 alleging a third cause of action of Violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices\n\nAct. Weaver and Jacobs filed their Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment on May 8, 2014.\n\nAJS Corp. filed its Response to Weaver & Jacob's Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nJune 24,2014.   A hearing was held on Weaver & Jacob's Motion for Summary Judgment on July\n\n2,2014 and it was denied by Order dated November 26,2014.         On July 30,2014, AJS Corp.\n\nfiled its Supplemental Answer and Counterclaim.        On August 4,2014, Weaver & Jacobs filed its\n\n\n                                                 -1-\n\fThird Amended Petition adding additional Defendant Air Jireh, and alleging additional causes of\n\naction of Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation against additional Defendant Sepulveda. Air\n\nJireh and Sepulveda filed an Answer on September 1, 2014. A trial on the merits was held on\n\nFebruary 2,2014.    The Court rendered its Judgment on February 5,2015 against Appellants.\n\nAppellants filed their Objections to Proposed Judgment and Motion to Clarify Court's Ruling\n\nsetting the matter for hearing on March 23, 2015. Appellants filed their Request for Findings of\n\nFact and Conclusions of Law on February 25,2015.      The Court signed a Judgment on March 5,\n\n2015. The Court rendered its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on March 20,2015.\n\nAppellants filed their Notice of Appeal on April23, 2015.\n\n                                     ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n        1. Whether the Trial Court erred in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions oflaw in\n\ngranting a judgment against AJS, Corp.\n\n       2. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that a valid, enforceable contract was formed\n\nbetween Weaver & Jacobs and Appellants.\n\n       3. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Air Jireh's Bid represented Air Jireh's\n\nenforceable promise, in such a manner that Weaver & Jacobs would act in reliance on the\n\npromise; and that Weaver & Jacobs did rely on the promise to its detriment.\n\n       4. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Weaver & Jacobs is entitled to any\n\nprotections afforded to consumers under the DTP A.\n\n       5. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda submitted a copy of Air Jireh's\n\nresume which contained several representations; that these representations were false; that\n\nSepulveda made these representations with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly, as positive\n\nassertions, without knowledge of their truth; and that Weaver & Jacobs relied on Oskar\n\nSepulveda's false representations.\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f        6. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda submitted the Bid to Weaver &\n\nJacobs, in which he represented that Air Jireh would perform the Work in exchange for the sum\n\nof $125,971. 00; that these representations were false; that Sepulveda made these representations\n\nwith knowledge oftheir falsity or recklessly, as positive assertions, without knowledge of their\n\ntruth; and that Weaver & Jacobs relied on Sepulveda's false representations.\n\n        7. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda represented to Weaver &\n\nJacobs that Air Jireh had 20 years experience, that Air Jireh had performed certain jobs, and that\n\nAir Jireh would perform the Work in exchange for $125,971.00; that these representations were\n\nfalse; that Sepulveda intended that Weaver & Jacobs to rely on said.\n\n        8. Whether the Trial Court erred in awarding attorney fees to Weaver & Jacobs.\n\n                                    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n        The parties filed a Joint Statement of Stipulated Facts. Additionally, on June 26,2013,\n\nSepulveda, Project Manager for Air Jireh found a request for proposals on the Builders\n\nExchange Website regarding the Taft Independent School District High School Improvements\n\nprojects (herein the \"Project\"). The same day Sepulveda submitted an email bid (herein\n\n\"original bid\") to Weaver & Jacobs in the amount of$147,732.00.       The original bid was per the\n\nplans and specifics of the project and was to include certain digital controls (herein \"controls\").\n\nDue to the fact Weaver & Jacobs were over budget, Mike Weaver of Weaver & Jacobs contacted\n\nSepulveda to engage in value engineering. On July 7,2013, Mr. Weaver sent Air Jireh an email\n\ninforming Air Jireh that Weaver & Jacobs wanted to replace the controls with wall-mounted\n\nthermostats.   On July 9, 2014 Air Jireh responded to Weaver & Jacobs by submitting a revised\n\nbid (herein \"first revised bid\") in the amount to f$132, 670.00 and was incorrectly dated June\n\n26,2013.   According to Weaver & Jacobs, Air Jireh had not adjusted the first revised bid to\n\nrecognize the full reduction price due to the fact that the controls were a single-source\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fspecification. Air Jireh submitted another revised bid (herein \"second revised bid\") in the\n\namount of $125,971.00 which indicated thennastats instead of controls and was also incorrectly\n\ndated June 26,2013.   On July 23,2013 Weaver & Jacobs sent a subcontract for Air Jireh to\n\nreview and sign. Air Jireh reviewed the subcontract and noticed problems with the subcontract.\n\nThe first problem with the contract was the commencement date. The date on the contract was\n\nJune 25,2013.   The commencement date was also June 25,2013, but the contract was forwarded\n\nto Air Jireh on July 23, 2013. The second problem with the contract was that it stated the\n\nsubcontract was to follow the scope and work in accordance with the plans and specifications.\n\nAlthough Air Jireh submitted three (3) separate bids, the plans and specifications were never\n\nproperly changed and included controls. As part of Air Jireh protocol, they will not submit\n\nsubmittals, shop drawings, or release PO information without having a signed contract with each\n\njob. Air Jireh could not sign the contract due to the above stated problems. Nonetheless, when\n\nWeaver & Jacobs presented their subcontract to a third-party after Air Jireh allegedly breached,\n\nthe subcontract had a different commencement date and the plans and specs were changed.\n\n                                 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       It is Appellants' position that the Trial Court has erred regarding its Judgment against\n\nAJS Corp., Air Jireh, and Sepulveda. First the Trial Court erred by granting a judgment against\n\nAJS, Corp. as there was no evidence of AJS Corp. at trial, in the Court's Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law, nor in the party's stipulated facts. Second, the Trial Court has erred in\n\nconcluding that a valid, enforceable contract was fanned. A contract can only exist if there is\n\nmutual assent or \"meeting of the minds\" regarding the subject matter and essential terms ofthe\n\ncontract. There was not an agreement to the terms of the contract. While Weaver & Jacobs\n\nthought certain details regarding controls and specs or commencement dates were not\n\nnecessarily important, they were important to Appellants' to avoid liability. If they were not so\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fimportant, then why did Weaver & Jacobs change the third-party subcontract after Appellants\n\nallegedly breached? Third, the Trial Court erred in concluding that Air Jireh's bid offer\n\nrepresented an enforceable promise. To succeed on a claim of promissory estoppel, Appellants\n\nfeel that the promise must be clear and unambiguous in its terms. As stated earlier, some\n\nmaterial aspects of the alleged promise/contract were not clear. Weaver & Jacobs felt that they\n\nwere not clear as well, which is why they changed the third-party subcontract. Fourth, the Trial\n\nCourt erred in concluding that Weaver & Jacobs was entitled to relief under the DTPA. Texas\n\nallows a DTPA claim to run with a breach of contract claim when the Defendant's\n\nmisrepresentation is made to induce the consumer into the transaction. However, there was\n\nnever any evidence of Appellants misrepresenting any information to induce Weaver & Jacobs\n\ninto the transaction. As a matter of fact, the evidence shows the contrary, that Appellants had\n\nevery intention to perform according to their bids, as long as both sides were clear on the terms.\n\nFurthermore, Weaver & Jacobs, as a matter oflaw, is not even entitled to the protections\n\nafforded to Consumers under the DTPA because Weaver & Jacobs is not a consumer as the\n\nconflict arose from a written contract that was more than $100,000.00. The fact that every bid\n\nsubmitted by Appellants was over $100,000.00 removes Weaver & Jacobs from the protections\n\nunder the DTP A. Fifth, the Trial Court erred in concluding that Sepulveda made false\n\nrepresentations when submitting the resume and submitting the bid. The only evidence\n\nregarding the resume of AJS Corp., was that it was true and correct as to the services performed\n\nand that the company had been in business for the past twenty (20) years. There was never any\n\ncontroverting evidence. A company is allowed to perform under a d/b/a and take credit for the\n\njobs. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence to show that Appellants never intended to enter\n\ninto a contract. The evidence actually shows that Appellants had every intention to enter into a\n\ncontract, but at an agreement to the terms, which there was never an agreement. Lastly, the Trial\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fCourt erred in awarding attorney fees to Weaver & Jacobs. The fees were not reasonable and\n\nnecessary. Furthermore, the fees were not segregated as they should have been because there\n\nwere multiple causes of action that were not so interrelated as required. An award of attorney's\n\nfees erroneously based upon evidence of unsegregated fees requires a remand.\n\n                                           ARGUMENT\n\n        Issue 1: The Trial Court erred in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions oflaw and in\n\ngranting a judgment against AJS Corp.\n\n\n                                ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n        On March 5, 2015, the Honorable Kemper Stephen Williams signed a Final Judgment in\n\nfavor of Weaver & Jacobs and against all Appellants. However, in the Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law signed by the Court on March 20,2015, AJS Corp. is never listed or even\n\nreferred to, only Air Jireh and Sepulveda are named. Furthermore, AJS Corp. was never a party\n\nin the Joint Statement of Stipulated Facts, nor was it listed in said Joint Statement of Stipulated\n\nFacts. Lastly, there was no evidence at trial to implicate AJS, Corp., only Air Jireh. In\n\nconsidering a no evidence point of error, this court must consider only evidence and inferences\n\nthat support the finding and disregard all contrary evidence and inferences. Dolenz v.\n\nContinental National Bank, 620 S.W.2d 572, 576 (Tex. 1985); Oxoco Exploration & Prod., Inc.\n\nv. Arrowhead Drilling Corp., No. A14 86 181 CV, 1986 WL 13431, at *1 (Tex. App. Nov.\n\n20, 1986). There was no evidence, nor were there any inferences as to AJS Corp. and as such it\n\nwas error for the Court to grant a judgment against AJS, Corp. without any evidence.\n\n\n       Issue 2: The Trial Court erred in ruling that a valid, enforceable contract was formed\n\nbetween Weaver & Jacobs and Air Jireh.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n        To establish the existence of an enforceable contract, a party must prove (l) an offer, (2)\n\nacceptance of the offer, (3) mutual assent or \"meeting of the minds\" regarding the subject matter\n\nand essential terms of the contract, and (4) consideration, or mutuality of obligations. See\n\nBaylor Univ. v. Sonnichsen, 221 S.W.3d 632,635 (Tex. 2007); Harca Energy, Inc. v. Re-Entry\n\nPeople, Inc., 23 S.W.3d 389,392 (Tex. App.-Amarillo, no pet.) (citing Federal Sign v. Texas S.\n\nUniv., 951 S.W.2d 401,408-09 (Tex. 1997)). To form a contract, the offer must be clear and\n\ndefinite. Gulf Coast Farmers Co-op v. Valley Co-op Oil Mill, 572 S.W.2d 726, 737 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.-Corpus Christi 1978). A court, in deciding whether a contract was made, should determine\n\nfrom the facts that all essential terms thereofhave been met. Id. The offer from Weaver &\n\nJacobs was anything but clear and definite, except of course to Weaver & Jacobs. RR 32:1-5;\n\n33: 11-34:22 Three different bids were submitted, all with the alleged date of June 26, 2013. RR\n\n31: 10-32:4. Likewise, there must be a clear and definite acceptance of all terms contained in the\n\noffer. Id. An acceptance must not change the terms of an offer. If it does, the offer is rejected.\n\nUnited Concrete Pipe Corp. v. Spin-Line Co., 430 S.W.2d 360,364 (Tex. 1968). A material\n\nchange in a proposed contract constitutes a counteroffer, which must be accepted by the other\n\nparty. Antonini v. Harris County Appraisal Dist. 999 S.W.2d 608, 614 (Tex. App.-Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.). It is well established under Texas Law that the submission ofa bid in\n\nresponse to an invitation for bids constitutes a formal offer to enter into a contract. Lane &\n\nNearn v. Warren, 115 S.W. 903 (Tex. Civ. App. 1909, writ refused). The submission of a\n\nsecond revised bid constituted an offer that Weaver & Jacobs had to accept. Weaver & Jacobs\n\nclaims to have accepted the bid and memorialized the acceptance by sending over a subcontract\n\non July 23,2014.   RR 23:5-20. It was this very subcontract that made Weaver & Jacob's alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\facceptance unclear and not definite. Mutuality of obligation refers to the parties' mutual\n\nunderstanding and assent to the expression of their agreement. Weynand v. Weynand, 990\n\nS.W.2d 843,846 (Tex. App.-Dallas 199, pet. denied.). The parties must agree to the same thing,\n\nin the same sense, at the same time. The determination of a meeting of the minds, and thus offer\n\nand acceptance, is based on the objective standard of what the parties said and did. Copeland v.\n\nAlsobrook,3   S.W.2d 598,604 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1999, pet. denied). The record is clear\n\nthat the parties were not on the same page. Sepulveda constantly refers to the fact that no terms\n\nwere agreed upon. RR 75:24-76:6; 76:20-21; 79:25-80:4; 80:16-23. Additionally, to further\n\ncorroborate the fact there was not mutual understanding between the parties we look to the\n\ncommencement date on both the subcontracts with Air Jireh and the Third-party subcontract.\n\nWeaver & Jacobs admits that the commencement date ofthe subcontracts sent to Air Jireh stated\n\nJune 25, 2015, despite the subcontract being created on July 23,2015.    RR 30:7-23.\n\nFurthermore Weaver & Jacobs believes that the commencement date is not important. RR\n\n30: 11-21. However, on the third party subcontract to Crossroads Mechanical that was necessary\n\nafter Air Jireh allegedly breached the contract, the commencement date stated August 20,2013\n\nwhile the subcontract was dated July 23,2015.    RR 32: 13-24. On the third party subcontract to\n\nCrossroads Mechanical, changes were made to the contract to make sure the terms were clear.\n\nRR 33:8-22. Again the fact that Weaver & Jacobs had to make changes to the subcontract when\n\nsending it to Crossroads Mechanical to make sure the parties were clear further corroborates the\n\nfact that there was no mutual agreement between Weaver and Jacobs and Air Jireh and thus no\n\ncontract.\n\n\n        Lastly, there could not have been a valid, enforceable contract due to the statute of\n\nfrauds. Under the statute of frauds, a promise or agreement is not enforceable unless the promise\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\for agreement, or a memorandum of it, is in writing; and signed by the person to be charged with\n\nthe promise or agreement or by someone lawfully authorized to sign for him. Tex. Bus. & Com.\n\nCode Alli. Â§ 26.01. In this case, there was never a written agreement that was signed by any of\n\nthe Appellants. A bid was submitted, however, it was never accepted. Rather, a subcontract was\n\nsent by Weaver & Jacobs that contained material changes and thus constituted a counter-offer as\n\nstated previously. There was never any evidence of a written contract signed by AJS Corp., Air\n\nJireh, or Sepulveda. Conversely, the subcontract with the third-party contained all required\n\nsignatures unlike this contract.\n\n\n           Issue 3: The Trial Court erred in ruling that Air Jireh's bid represented Air Jireh's\n\nenforceable promise to perform the Work in exchange for the amount of$125,971.00;             that Air\n\nJireh reasonably foresaw that Weaver & Jacobs would act in reliance on the promise; and that\n\nWeaver & Jacobs did rely on the promise to its detriment.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n           Under Texas law, a plaintiff alleging promissory estoppel must establish (1) a promise;\n\n(2) foreseeable reliance thereon by the promisor; (3) substantial reliance thereon by the\n\npromisee. English v. Fischer, 660 S.W.2d 521, 524 (Tex. 1993). Meanwhile, other Circuits\n\nhave held that in order to succeed on a claim of promissory estoppel, a plaintiff must prove: (1) a\n\npromise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance by the party to whom the promise is\n\nmade; (3) reliance both reasonable and foreseeable; and (4) injury due to the reliance. Premium\n\nHospitality, L.L.c. v. Astra Capital Funding, CIV.A. 12-0779,2014 WL 896807 (E.D. La. Mar.\n\n6,2014).     For the reasons stated under Appellants' Argument & Authorities for Issue 2, it is\n\nAppellants' position that the alleged promise by Appellants lacked the clarity necessary for\n\n\n\n\n                                                     -9-\n\fWeaver & Jacobs to claim promissory estoppel, thus barring Weaver & Jacobs from claiming\n\npromissory estoppel.\n\n\n        Issue 4: The Trial Court erred in ruling that Weaver & Jacobs is entitled to all\n\nprotections afforded to consumers under the DTP A.\n\n\n                                ARUGMENT        & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n        The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that \"[a]n allegation of a mere breach of\n\ncontract, without more, does not constitute a 'false, misleading or deceptive act' in violation of\n\nthe DTPA.\" Hernandez v.lkon Office Solutions, Inc., 306 F. App'x 180, 182 (5th Cir. 2009);\n\nTony Gullo Motors L L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299,304 (Tex.2006) (quoting Ashford Dev.,\n\nInc. v. USLife Real Estate Serv. Corp., 661 S.W.2d 933,935 (Tex. 1983). Texas law allows\n\nDTP A claims alongside contract claims when the defendant makes an initial misrepresentation\n\nthat was known at the time of the transaction and made to induce the consumer into the\n\ntransaction. Id. In the present case, the evidence is to the contrary in that there was never a\n\nmisrepresentation for Weaver & Jacobs to rely upon. There was no evidence presented that\n\nshowed that Sepulveda submitted the bid to induce Weaver & Jacobs into the transaction.\n\nSepulveda testified that he sent requests for submittals to M&M Metals, Mechanical Reps, and\n\nProfessional Air Balance indicating his intention to enter into a transaction. RR 78 :2-16; 79:21-\n\n24. Furthermore, Sepulveda informed Chris Brzozowski of Weaver & Jacobs that Air Jireh\n\nwould be willing to perform the work on this project, once the two sides could agree as to the\n\nterms. RR 79:25-80: 1-4. Not once, but twice did Sepulveda testify regarding the Appellants'\n\nintention to perform according to the bids submitted. It was not until August 15, 2015, wherein\n\nSepulveda acknowledged that witout a signed, written contract Air Jireh would not engage in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -10-\n\fproject. RR 80:16-23. Additionally, the testimony of Kristen Parisher and Javier Martinez\n\ncorroborate the fact that Sepulveda and Air Jireh intend to perfonn the work, but not without the\n\nproper understanding between the parties. According to Kristen Parisher, there was a concern\n\nover liability if the terms ofthe subcontract were not correct. RR 85: 18-87:6.\n\n\n        There was never any testimony regarding the DTP A and Plaintiff failed to prove its cause\n\nof action under the DTP A. Weaver & Jacobs does not constitute a \"consumer\" under the DTPA\n\ndue to the type of transaction involved. Further, the Deceptive Trade Practices Act does not\n\napply to a claim arising out of a written contract ifthe contract relates to a transaction, a project,\n\nor a set of transactions related to the same project involving total consideration by the consumer\n\nof more than $100,000.00. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. Â§ 17.49. The testimony throughout\n\ntrial was regarding a written subcontract. RR 23: 18-20; 42: 13-20. Additionally, the dispute\n\narose out of three different bids that were submitted to Weaver & Jacobs. All three (3) bids were\n\nfor an amount greater than $100,000.00. RR 12:10-14; 41 :23-42:5. The bid that Weaver &\n\nJacobs allegedly relied upon was for the amount of$125,971.00       RR 32:4-5. Accordingly, the\n\nDTP A does not apply specifically to this transaction and Weaver & Jacobs is not entitled to any\n\nrelief under the DTP A.\n\n\n        Issue 5: The Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda submitted a copy of Air Jireh's\n\nresume which contained several representations; that these representations were false; that\n\nSepulveda made these representations with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly, as positive\n\nassertions, without knowledge oftheir truth; and that Weaver & Jacobs relied on Sepulveda's\n\nfalse representations.

Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., 554 S.W.2d 183, 185\n\n(Tex. 1977). First, a resume was never submitted for Air Jireh. The resume submitted was for\n\nAJS Corp. Javier Martinez, the president of AJS, Corp., clearly states that \"this is a resume that\n\nI myself generated for Jireh Services Corporation.\" RR 62:3-4. For arguments sake, even if the\n\nresume was for Air Jireh, there was no evidence that the jobs on the resume were not performed.\n\nJavier Martinez testified that the resume is \"true and correct as to the services perfonned by Air\n\nJireh Services Corp.\" RR 61 :24-62:2. Javier Martinez also testified that the company been in\n\nbusiness for the past twenty (20). RR 57:9-58:4. There is no testimony to rebut the statements\n\nof Javier Martinez that the jobs listed on the resume were actually performed, that the resume\n\nwas incorrect, that the resume's recitation of'most recent jobs\" were false, or that the company\n\nhad been in business for over twenty (20) years. Although the jobs listed on the resume, were\n\nsome ofthe same jobs listed on the website of AC Plumbing Specialist, Javier Martinez\n\nadditionally testified that the entity Air Jireh, also goes by the name of AC Plumbing Specialist.\n\nRR 61 :15-18.; RR 66:19-23. A necessary element of fraud must involve a false representation.\n\nAs stated above, there is not any evidence to the contrary that the resume submitted by\n\nSepulveda was false. The Trial Court erred in ruling that the resume submitted by Sepulveda\n\n\n\n\n                                                -12-\n\fwas false. To his knowledge, they were true as he was given them by his employer, Javier\n\nMartinez, who verified through testimony that they were in fact true. Sepulveda, though perhaps\n\nunaware of whether all the jobs were accurate, had no reason to believe that they were false.\n\n\n        Issue 6: The Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda submitted the bid to Weaver &\n\nJacobs, in which he represented that Air Jireh would perform the Work in exchange for the sum\n\nof $125,971.00; that these representations were false; that Sepulveda made these representations\n\nwith knowledge of their falsity or recklessly, as positive assertions, without knowledge of their\n\ntruth; and that Weaver & Jacobs relied on Oskar Sepulveda, Jr's false representations.\n\n(Argument made only for purposes of continuity and NOT to assert any relief on behalf of\n\nSepulveda who has filed a Notice of Bankruptcy with the Court)\n\n\n                               ARGUMENT        & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n       A fraud cause of action requires a material misrepresentation, which was false, and which\n\nwas either known to be false when made or was asserted without knowledge of its truth, which\n\nwas intended to be acted upon, which was relied upon, and which caused injury.\" Formosa\n\nPlastics Corp. USA v. Presidio Engineers & Contractors, Inc., 960 S.W.2d 41,47-48 (Tex.\n\n1998); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Meadows, 877 S.W.2d 281,282 (Tex. 1994); *48 DeSantis v.\n\nWackenhut Corp., 793 S.W.2d 670, 688 (Tex. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1048, 111 S.Ct. 755,\n\n112 L.Ed.2d 775 (1991); see also Stone v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., 554 S.W.2d 183, 185\n\n(Tex. 1977). However, the mere failure to perform a contract is not evidence of fraud. Schindler\n\nv. Austwell Farmers Coop., 841 S.W.2d 853,854 (Tex. 1992). The Court in Formosa Plastics\n\nheld that evidence had to be presented that representations were made with the intent to deceive\n\nand with no intention of performing as represented. See Spoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 434; Stanfield,\n\n\n\n\n                                                -l3-\n\f462 S.W.2d at 272; see also TiO. Stanley Boot Co., 847 S.W.2d at 222; Moreover, the evidence\n\npresented must be relevant to Fonnosa's intent at the time the representation was made.\n\nSpoljaric, 708 S.W.2d at 434.\n\n        Weaver & Jacobs fails to meet this burden. Although the Court may have found that Air\n\nJireh failed to perfonned the contract, there was no evidence presented that showed that Air\n\nJireh, through Sepulveda, submitted the bid with an intent to deceive and with no intention of\n\nperforming as represented. As a matter ofthe fact, the evidence states the contrary. Sepulveda\n\ntestified that he sent requests for submittals to M&M Metals, Mechanical Reps, and Professional\n\nAir Balance. RR 78:2-16; 79:21-24. Additionally, Sepulveda informed Chris Brzozowski of\n\nWeaver & Jacobs that Air Jireh would be willing to perfonn the work on this project, once the\n\ntwo sides could agree as to the terms. RR 79:25-80:4. Not once, but twice did Sepulveda testify\n\nof Appellants' intention to perfonn according to the bids submitted. It was not until August 15,\n\n2015, wherein Sepulveda of Air Jireh refused to perfonn work on the project. RR 80:16-23.\n\nAdditionally, the testimony of Kristen Parisher and Javier Martinez corroborates the fact that\n\nSepulveda and Air Jireh intend to perfonn the work, but not without the proper understanding\n\nbetween the parties. According to Kristen Parisher, there was a concern over liability ifthe\n\nterms ofthe subcontract were not correct. RR 85:18-87:6\n\n       Issue 7: The Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda in the course and scope of his\n\nemployment, represented to Weaver & Jacobs that Air Jireh had twenty (20) years experience,\n\nthat Air Jireh had perfonned certain jobs, and that Air Jireh would perfonn the Work in\n\nexchange for $125,971.00; that these representations were false; that Sepulveda, in the course\n\nand scope of his employment, intended that Weaver & Jacobs to rely on said representations;\n\nthat Sepulveda failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining and communicating\n\nthe representations on behalf of Air Jireh.\n\n\n                                                -14-\n\f                                ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n        To establish a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, Plaintiff must prove the\n\nfollowing elements: (1) the representation was made in the course of Defendant's business; (2)\n\nfalse information was supplied for the guidance of others in their business; (3) Defendant did not\n\nexercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information; and (4)\n\nPlaintiff suffered pecuniary loss by justifiably relying on the representation. Daldav Associates,\n\nL.P. v. Lebar, 391 F. Supp. 2d 472,476 (N.D. Tex. 2005); See Dallas Firefighters Ass'n v. Booth\n\nResearch Group, Inc., 156 S.W.3d 188, 194 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2005); Airborne Freight Corp. v.\n\nCR. Lee Enters., 847 S.W.2d 289 (Tex.App.-EI Paso 1993, writ denied). A promise of future\n\nperformance constitutes an actionable misrepresentation if the promise was made with no\n\nintention of performing at the time it was made. Schindler v. Austwell Farmers Coop., 841\n\nS.W.2d 853,854 (Tex.1992).\n\n        Again, for the reasons stated in the Argument & Authorities under Issue 6, there was no\n\nevidence presented that showed that Sepulveda submitted the bid with an intent to deceive and\n\nwith no intention of performing as represented on behalf of Air Jireh. As a matter of the fact, the\n\nevidence states the contrary. Additionally, there is no testimony to rebut the statements of J avier\n\nMartinez that Air Jireh actually perfonned the jobs listed on the resume, that the resume was\n\nincorrect, that the resume's recitation of Air Jireh's \"most recent jobs\" were false, or that Air\n\nJireh had been in business for over twenty (20) years.\n\n        Issue 8: The Trial Court erred in awarding attorney fees to Weaver & Jacobs.\n\n                                ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n       As a general rule, the party seeking to recover attorney's fees carries the burden of proof.\n\nSee, e.g., Kimbrough v. Fox, 631 S.W.2d 606, 609 (Tex.App.-Fort          Worth 1982, no writ);\n\n\n\n                                                  -15-\n\fCorpus Christi Dev. Corp. v. Carlton, 644 S.W.2d 521,523 (Tex.App.-Corpus              Christi 1982, no\n\nwrit); Bavarian Autohaus, Inc. v. Holland, 570 S.W.2d 110,116 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston               [1st\n\nDist.] 1978, no writ). The trial court may award those fees that are \"reasonable and necessary\"\n\nfor the prosecution of the suit. See, e.g., Green Tree Acceptance, Inc. v. Pierce, 768 S. W 2d 416,\n\n425 (Tex.App.-Tyler     1989, no writ); Flint &Assoc. v. Intercontinental Pipe & Steel, Inc., 739\n\nS. W2d 622, 624 (Tex.App.-Dallas       1987, writ denied); Rosas v. Bursey, 724 S. W2d 402,\n\n410-11 (Tex.App.-Fort      Worth 1986, no writ); Graves v. Sommerfeld, 618 S. W2d 952, 954-55\n\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Waco      1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.). It is Appellant's position that the fees in this case\n\nare not reasonable and necessary as they are more than the actual judgment awarded.\n\nFurthermore, attorney fees were granted based upon Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice\n\nand Remedies Code and Section 17.50 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. It is\n\nappellant's position that Weaver & Jacobs is not entitled to any protections afforded to\n\nconsumers under the DTP A and thus the attorney fees must be segregated. Attorney's fees\n\nattributable to separate causes of action must be segregated unless the claims arise from the same\n\ntransaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of\n\nessentially the same facts. Villasenor v. Villasenor, 911 S.W.2d 411, 420 (Tex. App. 1995). For\n\nargument's sake, assuming that the separate causes of action alleged by Weaver & Jacobs arise\n\nfrom the same transaction, they are not so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails\n\nproof or denial of essentially the same facts. A cause of action under the DTP A requires a party\n\nto be a consumer, which is not required under Breach of Contract, nor Promissory Estoppel.\n\nThus, additional proof is required for a DTP A transaction than is required under breach of\n\ncontract and promissory estoppel. As a result of this segregation, an award of attorney's fees\n\nerroneously based upon evidence of unsegregated fees requires a remand. Stewart Title Guar.\n\nCo. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 11 (Tex. 1991)\n\n\n                                                  -16-\n\f                                              PRAYER\n\n        For the foregoing reasons stated herein above, Appellants respectfully request that the\n\nCourt of Appeals reverse the Order of the Trial Court.

Oskar Sepulveda, Jr. (\"Sepulveda\") is an individual who resides in Texas.\n\n        5.      On April 8, 2013, Weaver & Jacobs entered into a prime contract with Taft\n\nIndependent School District (\"TISD\") for the Taft Independent School District High School\n\nImprovements, Taft, Texas (the \"Project\").\n\n        6.      TISO is the owner of the Project, and Weaver & Jacobs agreed to act as the\n\nConstruction Manager at Risk for the construction of a new front office. among other improvements.\n\n        7.      Weaver & Jacobs issued a Notice of Requests for Proposals from Subcontractors and\n\nSuppliers (the \"Requests for Proposals\").\n\n        8.      In the Requests for Proposals, Weaver & Jacobs requested bid offers from\n\nsubcontractors and suppliers indicating the price for which they would be willing to perfonn certain\n\nscopes of work on, or to supply materials to, the Project.\n\n        9.     All bid offers were required to be submitted to Weaver & Jacobs by June 26, 2013.\n\n        10.

The Original Bid included the cost for certain digital controls (the \"Digital Controls\")\n\nto be installed as part of the Work.\n\n        13.    Air JÃ­reh sent with the Original Bid a copy of Air Jireh's rÃ©sumÃ©.\n\n        14.    The Digital Controls were a single-source specification, which means that every offer\n\nto perform the work submitted to Weaver & Jacobs was to include the Digital Controls at the same\n\ncost of$23,561.00.\n\n\nFINDiNGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAWÂ· Page 2                                                             I38554.lI2845.002\n                                                                                                    352\n\f         15.

After Weaver & Jacobs received and compiled all of the subcontractor offers for the\n\nentire Project, it was necessary for Weaver & Jacobs to engage in value engineering to reduce the\n\nProject's price.\n\n         17.       On June 26, 2013, at2:29 p.m., Weaver&Jacohs sent Air Jireh an e-mail asking Air\n\nJireh to confirm that it had included in its Original Bid the Digital Controls at a price of \"around\n\n$25k,\"\n\n         18.       On June26, 2013, at2:56 p.m., Air Jireh sent Weaver &Jacobsane~mailconfirming\n\nthat the Digital Controls were included in its Original Bid at a price of $24,986,00.\n\n         19.       As part of a comprehensive budget reduction plan, Weaver & Jacobs and TISD agreed\n\nto replace the Digital Controls with less expensive wall-mounted thermostats (the \"Thermostats\").\n\n         20.

On July 9, 2013. Air Jireh submitted to Weaver & Jacobs a revised bid offer in the\n\namount of $132,670.00 (the \"Revised Bid\"). However, the Revised Bid's price did not properly\n\nrecognize the full deduction for substituting the Thermostats tor the Digital Controls.\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW ~Page 3                                                              138554.112845.002\n                                                                                                     353\n\f        24.    Air Jireh agreed to submit a bid offer in the amount of$125,971.00 (the Original Bid\n\nof$147,732.00 minus $23,561.00 for the Digital Controls plus $1,800.00 for the Thermostats).\n\n       25.     Weaver & Jacobs informed Air Jireh that it would accept Air Jireh's $125,971.00\n\noffer and would issue a subcontract in the amount of$125,971.00 to Air JÃ­reh to memorialize their\n\nagreement.\n\n       26.     On July 16.2013, Air Jireh sent Weaver & Jacobs an e-mail indicating that Air Jireh\n\nhad \"revised [the] HVAC proposal with programmable t-stats in lieu of the controlsl.]\"\n\n       27.     Attached to Air Jireh' s July 16, 2013, e-mail was Air Jireh' s corrected bid offer (the\n\n\"Corrected Bid Offer\"). which properly substituted the cost of the Digital Controls with the cost of\n\nthe Thermostats, but which was incorrectly dated \"June 26,2013.\"\n\n       28.     In the Corrected Bid Offer, Air Jireh offered to perform the Work in exchange for\n\namount of$125,971.00.\n\n       29.     Air Jireh's July 16, 2013, e-mall concluding by thanking Weaver & Jacobs for \"the\n\nopportunity\" and stating that Air Jireh \"lookjed] forward to working for [Weaver & Jacobs].\"\n\n       30.     Weaver & Jacobs accepted the Corrected Bid Offer.\n\n       31.     On July 23, 2013, Weaver & Jacobs sent Air Jireh a subcontract in the amount of\n\n$125,971.00 (the \"Subcontract\"), which communicated Weaver & Jacobs' acceptance of the\n\nCorrected Bid Offer.\n\n       32.     The following provision was included in the Subcontract on page six:\n\n\"EXCLUSIONS: Per quote dated 6/26/13.\"\n\n       33.     On August 5, 2013, Weaver & Jacobs sent an e-mail to all of the Project's\n\nsubcontractors, including Air Jireh, which stated that each recipient had recently contracted with\n\nWeaver & Jacobs.\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LA W â¢ Page 4                                                           138554.1/2845.002\n                                                                                                     354\n\f         34.

On or about August 10,2013, after not receiving a response to the August 5, 2013,\n\nrequest for submittals. Chris Brzozowski (\"Brzozowski\"), Weaver & Jacobs' project manager,\n\ncontacted Air JÃ­reh via telephone to seek assurances that Air JÃ­reh still planned to perform the Work.\n\nDuring the telephone conversation, Sepulveda represented to Weaver & Jacobs that Air Jireh would\n\nperfonn the Work.\n\n         36.   On or about August 15, 2013, Brzozowski again contacted Air JÃ­reh via telephone and\n\nspoke with Sepulveda. During that telephone conversation, Sepulveda represented that Air Jireh\n\nwould neither execute the Subcontract nor perform the Work as it had promised in the Corrected Bid\n\nOffer.\n\n         37.   Weaver & Jacobs was forced to enter into a subcontract with a third party to perform\n\nthe Work for the amount of$142,347.00, which was $16,556.00 more than the amount agreed to by\n\nAir Jireh in the Corrected Bid Offer for the performance of the Work.\n\n         38.   On or about January 23,2013, HVAC Plumbing Specialist Inc filed with the Bexar\n\nCounty Clerk an assumed name certificate whereby HVAC Plumbing Specialist Inc would conduct\n\nbusiness as \"Air JÃ­reh Service\" (tbe \"Assumed Name Certificate\").

CONCLUSIONS    OF LAW\n\n          39.   A valid, enforceable contract was formed between Weaver & Jacobs and Air Jireh\n\nafter Weaver & Jacobs accepted Air Jireh's Corrected Bid Offer to perform the Work in exchange\n\nfor the sum of$125,791.00. Air JÃ­reh breached its contract with Weaver & Jacobs by refusing to\n\nperform the Work. Air Jireh' s breach of contract caused injury to Weaver & Jacobs in the amount of\n\n$16,556.00. Air Jireh failed to establish by a preponderance orthe evidence that it has any valid\n\nexcuse or defense to liability for its material breach of its contractual obligations to Weaver &\n\nJacobs.\n\n          40.   Air Jireh's Corrected Bid Offer in the amount of$125,971.00 represented Air Jireh's\n\nenforceable promise to perform the Work in exchange for that amount. Air Jireh reasonably foresaw\n\nthat Weaver & Jacobs would act in reliance on the promise, and Weaver & Jacobs did, in fact, rely\n\non the promise to its detriment in calculating the GMP for the Project As a direct and proximate\n\nresult of Air JÃ­reh's refusal to perform the Work as promised, Weaver & Jacobs was damaged in the\n\namount of$16.556.00. Air Jireh failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it has any\n\nvalid excuse or defense to liability for its failure to fulfill its promise to perform the Work.\n\n          41.   Weaver & Jacobs is a consumer under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Tex.\n\nBus. & Com. Code Â§ 17.41 et seq. (the \"DTP A\"), because it is a corporation that sought to purchase\n\nfrom Air Jireh goods and services needed to perform the Work on the Project. Weaver & Jacobs is\n\nthus entitled to all protections afforded to consumers under the DTP A. Air Jireh can be sued under\n\nthe DTP A because it sells and installs HVAC systems and provides service for existing systems. By\n\noffering to perform the Work on the Proj eet in exchange for the sum of $125,971.00, and then orally\n\nrepudiating its proposal, Air Jireh engaged in false, misleading, and deceptive acts in the conduct of\n\nits trade and in violation of Tex.

Such\n\n\"laundry list\" violations include (1) advertising goods or services with the intent not to sell them as\n\nadvertised and (2) representing that an agreement confers or involves rights, remedies, or obligations\n\nthat it does not. Weaver & Jacobs relied on Air Jireh's false, misleading, and deceptive acts to its\n\ndetriment by using Air Jireh's proposal to compute its GMP for the Project. Air Jireh's conduct\n\nforced Weaver & Jacobs to contract with another subcontractor at a substantially higher contract\n\nprice than that which was promised by Air Jireh, Air Jireh is the producing cause of Weaver &\n\nJacobs' damages in the amount of$16,5 56.00. Air Jireh failed to establish by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that it has any valid excuse or defense to liability for its false, misleading, and deceptive\n\nacts.\n\n        42.    Sepulveda included with Air JÃ­reh's Original Bid offer a copy Air JÃ­reh's rÃ©sumÃ©.\n\nThe rÃ©sumÃ© contained several false representations, including the assertion that Air JÃ­reh had been\n\ndoing business in the San Antonio area for the past 20 years and a recitation of certain \"most recent\n\njobs.\" Sepulveda also submitted the Corrected Bid Offer to Weaver & Jacobs, in which he\n\nrepresented that Air JÃ­reh would perform the Work in exchange for the sum of$125,971.00. Further,\n\non or about August 10, 2013, Sepulveda represented to Weaver & Jacobs that Air JÃ­reh would\n\nperform the Work as promised in the Corrected Bid Offer. These representations were material in\n\nthat Weaver & Jacobs relied on the representations to make its decision to accept Air Jireh's bid\n\noffer and would not have done so absent the representations. These representations were false.\n\nSepulveda made these representations with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly, as positive\n\nassertions, without knowledge of their truth. Weaver & Jacobs relied on Sepulveda's false\n\nrepresentations in calculating its GMP and, after Air Jireh refused to perform the Work, Weaver &\n\nJacobs was forced to subcontract with a third party to perform the Work, resulting in damages to\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW - Page 7                                                            138554.112845.002\n                                                                                                     357\n\f Weaver& Jacobs in the amount of$16,556.00. Sepulveda failed to establish by a preponderance of\n\n the evidence that he has any valid excuse or defense to liability for his fraudulent representations to\n\nWeaver & Jacobs.\n\n        43.     Sepulveda represented to Weaver & Jacobs that Air Jireh had 20 years' experience\n\ndoing business in the San Antonio area, that Ail'Jireh had performed certain recent jobs, and that Air\n\nJireh would perform the Work in exchange for $125,971.00. These representations were false, and\n\nSepulveda intended that Weaver & Jacobs rely on the representations. Sepulveda failed to exercise\n\nreasonable care or competence in obtaining and communicating these representations. Sepulveda\n\nintended that Weaver & Jacobs use these representations as guidance. Weaver & Jacobs reasonably\n\nand justifiably relied on Sepulveda's false representations to its detriment, resulting in damages to\n\nWeaver & Jacobs in the amount of $16,556.00. Sepulveda failed to establish by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that he has any valid excuse or defense to liability for his negligent misrepresentations\n\nto Weaver & Jacobs.\n\n        44.    All conditions precedent to Weaver & Jacobs' entitlement to recovery have been\n\nperformed. have occurred, or have been excused.\n\n       45.

DIBI A Air Jireh Service A/KlAI\n\nAir Jireh Services (herein \"Air Jireh\") and Oskar Sepulveda, Jr. (herein \"Sepulveda\") file this\n\nbrief asking the Court to reverse the Order of the trial court against AJS Corp., Air Jireh, and\n\nSepulveda (herein collectively \"Appellants\"). Appellants respectfully show that prior to the\n\nfiling of this brief, Appellant Sepulveda, filed a Notice of Bankruptcy in this Court. As such, in\n\norder to not violate the Stay as to Sepulveda, Appellants continue the references to Sepulveda in\n\nthis brief only for purposes of continuity in Appellant AJS Corp. And Air Jireh's argument and\n\nnot to assert any relief in violation of the Bankruptcy Stay.\n\n                                 STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n       This is an appeal from the February 2,2015 trial concerning Plaintiff, Weaver and &\n\nJacobs (herein \"Weaver & Jacobs \") claims of Breach of Contract, Promissory Estoppel, and\n\nViolation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act against AJS Corp. and claims of Fraud and\n\nNegligent Misrepresentation against Sepulveda.\n\n       Weaver & Jacobs filed an original petition against AJS Corp. for Breach of Contract and\n\nPromissory Estoppel on or about October 3, 2013. AJS Corp. filed an Original Answer on\n\nOctober December 2,2013.      Weaver and Jacobs then filed a Second Amended Petition on\n\nJanuary 22, 2014 alleging a third cause of action of Violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices\n\nAct. Weaver and Jacobs filed their Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment on May 8, 2014.\n\nAJS Corp. filed its Response to Weaver & Jacob's Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nJune 24,2014.   A hearing was held on Weaver & Jacob's Motion for Summary Judgment on July\n\n2,2014 and it was denied by Order dated November 26,2014.         On July 30,2014, AJS Corp.\n\nfiled its Supplemental Answer and Counterclaim.        On August 4,2014, Weaver & Jacobs filed its\n\n\n                                                 -1-\n\fThird Amended Petition adding additional Defendant Air Jireh, and alleging additional causes of\n\naction of Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation against additional Defendant Sepulveda. Air\n\nJireh and Sepulveda filed an Answer on September 1, 2014. A trial on the merits was held on\n\nFebruary 2,2014.    The Court rendered its Judgment on February 5,2015 against Appellants.\n\nAppellants filed their Objections to Proposed Judgment and Motion to Clarify Court's Ruling\n\nsetting the matter for hearing on March 23, 2015. Appellants filed their Request for Findings of\n\nFact and Conclusions of Law on February 25,2015.      The Court signed a Judgment on March 5,\n\n2015. The Court rendered its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on March 20,2015.\n\nAppellants filed their Notice of Appeal on April23, 2015.\n\n                                     ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n        1. Whether the Trial Court erred in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions oflaw in\n\ngranting a judgment against AJS, Corp.\n\n       2. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that a valid, enforceable contract was formed\n\nbetween Weaver & Jacobs and Appellants.\n\n       3. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Air Jireh's Bid represented Air Jireh's\n\nenforceable promise, in such a manner that Weaver & Jacobs would act in reliance on the\n\npromise; and that Weaver & Jacobs did rely on the promise to its detriment.\n\n       4. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Weaver & Jacobs is entitled to any\n\nprotections afforded to consumers under the DTP A.\n\n       5. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda submitted a copy of Air Jireh's\n\nresume which contained several representations; that these representations were false; that\n\nSepulveda made these representations with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly, as positive\n\nassertions, without knowledge of their truth; and that Weaver & Jacobs relied on Oskar\n\nSepulveda's false representations.\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f        6. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda submitted the Bid to Weaver &\n\nJacobs, in which he represented that Air Jireh would perform the Work in exchange for the sum\n\nof $125,971. 00; that these representations were false; that Sepulveda made these representations\n\nwith knowledge oftheir falsity or recklessly, as positive assertions, without knowledge of their\n\ntruth; and that Weaver & Jacobs relied on Sepulveda's false representations.\n\n        7. Whether the Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda represented to Weaver &\n\nJacobs that Air Jireh had 20 years experience, that Air Jireh had performed certain jobs, and that\n\nAir Jireh would perform the Work in exchange for $125,971.00; that these representations were\n\nfalse; that Sepulveda intended that Weaver & Jacobs to rely on said.\n\n        8. Whether the Trial Court erred in awarding attorney fees to Weaver & Jacobs.\n\n                                    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n        The parties filed a Joint Statement of Stipulated Facts. Additionally, on June 26,2013,\n\nSepulveda, Project Manager for Air Jireh found a request for proposals on the Builders\n\nExchange Website regarding the Taft Independent School District High School Improvements\n\nprojects (herein the \"Project\"). The same day Sepulveda submitted an email bid (herein\n\n\"original bid\") to Weaver & Jacobs in the amount of$147,732.00.       The original bid was per the\n\nplans and specifics of the project and was to include certain digital controls (herein \"controls\").\n\nDue to the fact Weaver & Jacobs were over budget, Mike Weaver of Weaver & Jacobs contacted\n\nSepulveda to engage in value engineering. On July 7,2013, Mr. Weaver sent Air Jireh an email\n\ninforming Air Jireh that Weaver & Jacobs wanted to replace the controls with wall-mounted\n\nthermostats.   On July 9, 2014 Air Jireh responded to Weaver & Jacobs by submitting a revised\n\nbid (herein \"first revised bid\") in the amount to f$132, 670.00 and was incorrectly dated June\n\n26,2013.   According to Weaver & Jacobs, Air Jireh had not adjusted the first revised bid to\n\nrecognize the full reduction price due to the fact that the controls were a single-source\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fspecification. Air Jireh submitted another revised bid (herein \"second revised bid\") in the\n\namount of $125,971.00 which indicated thennastats instead of controls and was also incorrectly\n\ndated June 26,2013.   On July 23,2013 Weaver & Jacobs sent a subcontract for Air Jireh to\n\nreview and sign. Air Jireh reviewed the subcontract and noticed problems with the subcontract.\n\nThe first problem with the contract was the commencement date. The date on the contract was\n\nJune 25,2013.   The commencement date was also June 25,2013, but the contract was forwarded\n\nto Air Jireh on July 23, 2013. The second problem with the contract was that it stated the\n\nsubcontract was to follow the scope and work in accordance with the plans and specifications.\n\nAlthough Air Jireh submitted three (3) separate bids, the plans and specifications were never\n\nproperly changed and included controls. As part of Air Jireh protocol, they will not submit\n\nsubmittals, shop drawings, or release PO information without having a signed contract with each\n\njob. Air Jireh could not sign the contract due to the above stated problems. Nonetheless, when\n\nWeaver & Jacobs presented their subcontract to a third-party after Air Jireh allegedly breached,\n\nthe subcontract had a different commencement date and the plans and specs were changed.\n\n                                 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       It is Appellants' position that the Trial Court has erred regarding its Judgment against\n\nAJS Corp., Air Jireh, and Sepulveda. First the Trial Court erred by granting a judgment against\n\nAJS, Corp. as there was no evidence of AJS Corp. at trial, in the Court's Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law, nor in the party's stipulated facts. Second, the Trial Court has erred in\n\nconcluding that a valid, enforceable contract was fanned. A contract can only exist if there is\n\nmutual assent or \"meeting of the minds\" regarding the subject matter and essential terms ofthe\n\ncontract. There was not an agreement to the terms of the contract. While Weaver & Jacobs\n\nthought certain details regarding controls and specs or commencement dates were not\n\nnecessarily important, they were important to Appellants' to avoid liability. If they were not so\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fimportant, then why did Weaver & Jacobs change the third-party subcontract after Appellants\n\nallegedly breached? Third, the Trial Court erred in concluding that Air Jireh's bid offer\n\nrepresented an enforceable promise. To succeed on a claim of promissory estoppel, Appellants\n\nfeel that the promise must be clear and unambiguous in its terms. As stated earlier, some\n\nmaterial aspects of the alleged promise/contract were not clear. Weaver & Jacobs felt that they\n\nwere not clear as well, which is why they changed the third-party subcontract. Fourth, the Trial\n\nCourt erred in concluding that Weaver & Jacobs was entitled to relief under the DTPA. Texas\n\nallows a DTPA claim to run with a breach of contract claim when the Defendant's\n\nmisrepresentation is made to induce the consumer into the transaction. However, there was\n\nnever any evidence of Appellants misrepresenting any information to induce Weaver & Jacobs\n\ninto the transaction. As a matter of fact, the evidence shows the contrary, that Appellants had\n\nevery intention to perform according to their bids, as long as both sides were clear on the terms.\n\nFurthermore, Weaver & Jacobs, as a matter oflaw, is not even entitled to the protections\n\nafforded to Consumers under the DTPA because Weaver & Jacobs is not a consumer as the\n\nconflict arose from a written contract that was more than $100,000.00. The fact that every bid\n\nsubmitted by Appellants was over $100,000.00 removes Weaver & Jacobs from the protections\n\nunder the DTP A. Fifth, the Trial Court erred in concluding that Sepulveda made false\n\nrepresentations when submitting the resume and submitting the bid. The only evidence\n\nregarding the resume of AJS Corp., was that it was true and correct as to the services performed\n\nand that the company had been in business for the past twenty (20) years. There was never any\n\ncontroverting evidence. A company is allowed to perform under a d/b/a and take credit for the\n\njobs. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence to show that Appellants never intended to enter\n\ninto a contract. The evidence actually shows that Appellants had every intention to enter into a\n\ncontract, but at an agreement to the terms, which there was never an agreement. Lastly, the Trial\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fCourt erred in awarding attorney fees to Weaver & Jacobs. The fees were not reasonable and\n\nnecessary. Furthermore, the fees were not segregated as they should have been because there\n\nwere multiple causes of action that were not so interrelated as required. An award of attorney's\n\nfees erroneously based upon evidence of unsegregated fees requires a remand.\n\n                                           ARGUMENT\n\n        Issue 1: The Trial Court erred in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions oflaw and in\n\ngranting a judgment against AJS Corp.\n\n\n                                ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n        On March 5, 2015, the Honorable Kemper Stephen Williams signed a Final Judgment in\n\nfavor of Weaver & Jacobs and against all Appellants. However, in the Findings of Fact and\n\nConclusions of Law signed by the Court on March 20,2015, AJS Corp. is never listed or even\n\nreferred to, only Air Jireh and Sepulveda are named. Furthermore, AJS Corp. was never a party\n\nin the Joint Statement of Stipulated Facts, nor was it listed in said Joint Statement of Stipulated\n\nFacts. Lastly, there was no evidence at trial to implicate AJS, Corp., only Air Jireh. In\n\nconsidering a no evidence point of error, this court must consider only evidence and inferences\n\nthat support the finding and disregard all contrary evidence and inferences.

App.-San Antonio 1999, pet. denied). The record is clear\n\nthat the parties were not on the same page. Sepulveda constantly refers to the fact that no terms\n\nwere agreed upon. RR 75:24-76:6; 76:20-21; 79:25-80:4; 80:16-23. Additionally, to further\n\ncorroborate the fact there was not mutual understanding between the parties we look to the\n\ncommencement date on both the subcontracts with Air Jireh and the Third-party subcontract.\n\nWeaver & Jacobs admits that the commencement date ofthe subcontracts sent to Air Jireh stated\n\nJune 25, 2015, despite the subcontract being created on July 23,2015.    RR 30:7-23.\n\nFurthermore Weaver & Jacobs believes that the commencement date is not important. RR\n\n30: 11-21. However, on the third party subcontract to Crossroads Mechanical that was necessary\n\nafter Air Jireh allegedly breached the contract, the commencement date stated August 20,2013\n\nwhile the subcontract was dated July 23,2015.    RR 32: 13-24. On the third party subcontract to\n\nCrossroads Mechanical, changes were made to the contract to make sure the terms were clear.\n\nRR 33:8-22. Again the fact that Weaver & Jacobs had to make changes to the subcontract when\n\nsending it to Crossroads Mechanical to make sure the parties were clear further corroborates the\n\nfact that there was no mutual agreement between Weaver and Jacobs and Air Jireh and thus no\n\ncontract.\n\n\n        Lastly, there could not have been a valid, enforceable contract due to the statute of\n\nfrauds. Under the statute of frauds, a promise or agreement is not enforceable unless the promise\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\for agreement, or a memorandum of it, is in writing; and signed by the person to be charged with\n\nthe promise or agreement or by someone lawfully authorized to sign for him. Tex. Bus. & Com.\n\nCode Alli. Â§ 26.01. In this case, there was never a written agreement that was signed by any of\n\nthe Appellants. A bid was submitted, however, it was never accepted. Rather, a subcontract was\n\nsent by Weaver & Jacobs that contained material changes and thus constituted a counter-offer as\n\nstated previously. There was never any evidence of a written contract signed by AJS Corp., Air\n\nJireh, or Sepulveda. Conversely, the subcontract with the third-party contained all required\n\nsignatures unlike this contract.\n\n\n           Issue 3: The Trial Court erred in ruling that Air Jireh's bid represented Air Jireh's\n\nenforceable promise to perform the Work in exchange for the amount of$125,971.00;             that Air\n\nJireh reasonably foresaw that Weaver & Jacobs would act in reliance on the promise; and that\n\nWeaver & Jacobs did rely on the promise to its detriment.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n           Under Texas law, a plaintiff alleging promissory estoppel must establish (1) a promise;\n\n(2) foreseeable reliance thereon by the promisor; (3) substantial reliance thereon by the\n\npromisee.

Meanwhile, other Circuits\n\nhave held that in order to succeed on a claim of promissory estoppel, a plaintiff must prove: (1) a\n\npromise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance by the party to whom the promise is\n\nmade; (3) reliance both reasonable and foreseeable; and (4) injury due to the reliance.

For the reasons stated under Appellants' Argument & Authorities for Issue 2, it is\n\nAppellants' position that the alleged promise by Appellants lacked the clarity necessary for\n\n\n\n\n                                                     -9-\n\fWeaver & Jacobs to claim promissory estoppel, thus barring Weaver & Jacobs from claiming\n\npromissory estoppel.\n\n\n        Issue 4: The Trial Court erred in ruling that Weaver & Jacobs is entitled to all\n\nprotections afforded to consumers under the DTP A.\n\n\n                                ARUGMENT        & AUTHORITIES\n\n\n        The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that \"[a]n allegation of a mere breach of\n\ncontract, without more, does not constitute a 'false, misleading or deceptive act' in violation of\n\nthe DTPA.\" Hernandez v.lkon Office Solutions, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Texas law allows\n\nDTP A claims alongside contract claims when the defendant makes an initial misrepresentation\n\nthat was known at the time of the transaction and made to induce the consumer into the\n\ntransaction. Id. In the present case, the evidence is to the contrary in that there was never a\n\nmisrepresentation for Weaver & Jacobs to rely upon. There was no evidence presented that\n\nshowed that Sepulveda submitted the bid to induce Weaver & Jacobs into the transaction.\n\nSepulveda testified that he sent requests for submittals to M&M Metals, Mechanical Reps, and\n\nProfessional Air Balance indicating his intention to enter into a transaction. RR 78 :2-16; 79:21-\n\n24. Furthermore, Sepulveda informed Chris Brzozowski of Weaver & Jacobs that Air Jireh\n\nwould be willing to perform the work on this project, once the two sides could agree as to the\n\nterms. RR 79:25-80: 1-4. Not once, but twice did Sepulveda testify regarding the Appellants'\n\nintention to perform according to the bids submitted. It was not until August 15, 2015, wherein\n\nSepulveda acknowledged that witout a signed, written contract Air Jireh would not engage in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -10-\n\fproject. RR 80:16-23. Additionally, the testimony of Kristen Parisher and Javier Martinez\n\ncorroborate the fact that Sepulveda and Air Jireh intend to perfonn the work, but not without the\n\nproper understanding between the parties. According to Kristen Parisher, there was a concern\n\nover liability if the terms ofthe subcontract were not correct. RR 85: 18-87:6.\n\n\n        There was never any testimony regarding the DTP A and Plaintiff failed to prove its cause\n\nof action under the DTP A. Weaver & Jacobs does not constitute a \"consumer\" under the DTPA\n\ndue to the type of transaction involved. Further, the Deceptive Trade Practices Act does not\n\napply to a claim arising out of a written contract ifthe contract relates to a transaction, a project,\n\nor a set of transactions related to the same project involving total consideration by the consumer\n\nof more than $100,000.00. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. Â§ 17.49. The testimony throughout\n\ntrial was regarding a written subcontract. RR 23: 18-20; 42: 13-20. Additionally, the dispute\n\narose out of three different bids that were submitted to Weaver & Jacobs. All three (3) bids were\n\nfor an amount greater than $100,000.00. RR 12:10-14; 41 :23-42:5. The bid that Weaver &\n\nJacobs allegedly relied upon was for the amount of$125,971.00       RR 32:4-5. Accordingly, the\n\nDTP A does not apply specifically to this transaction and Weaver & Jacobs is not entitled to any\n\nrelief under the DTP A.\n\n\n        Issue 5: The Trial Court erred in ruling that Sepulveda submitted a copy of Air Jireh's\n\nresume which contained several representations; that these representations were false; that\n\nSepulveda made these representations with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly, as positive\n\nassertions, without knowledge oftheir truth; and that Weaver & Jacobs relied on Sepulveda's\n\nfalse representations.

For arguments sake, even if the\n\nresume was for Air Jireh, there was no evidence that the jobs on the resume were not performed.\n\nJavier Martinez testified that the resume is \"true and correct as to the services perfonned by Air\n\nJireh Services Corp.\" RR 61 :24-62:2. Javier Martinez also testified that the company been in\n\nbusiness for the past twenty (20). RR 57:9-58:4. There is no testimony to rebut the statements\n\nof Javier Martinez that the jobs listed on the resume were actually performed, that the resume\n\nwas incorrect, that the resume's recitation of'most recent jobs\" were false, or that the company\n\nhad been in business for over twenty (20) years.

A necessary element of fraud must involve a false representation.\n\nAs stated above, there is not any evidence to the contrary that the resume submitted by\n\nSepulveda was false.

It is Appellant's position that the fees in this case\n\nare not reasonable and necessary as they are more than the actual judgment awarded.\n\nFurthermore, attorney fees were granted based upon Section 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice\n\nand Remedies Code and Section 17.50 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. It is\n\nappellant's position that Weaver & Jacobs is not entitled to any protections afforded to\n\nconsumers under the DTP A and thus the attorney fees must be segregated. Attorney's fees\n\nattributable to separate causes of action must be segregated unless the claims arise from the same\n\ntransaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of\n\nessentially the same facts.

For\n\nargument's sake, assuming that the separate causes of action alleged by Weaver & Jacobs arise\n\nfrom the same transaction, they are not so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails\n\nproof or denial of essentially the same facts. A cause of action under the DTP A requires a party\n\nto be a consumer, which is not required under Breach of Contract, nor Promissory Estoppel.\n\nThus, additional proof is required for a DTP A transaction than is required under breach of\n\ncontract and promissory estoppel. As a result of this segregation, an award of attorney's fees\n\nerroneously based upon evidence of unsegregated fees requires a remand. Stewart Title Guar.\n\nCo. v.

Oskar Sepulveda, Jr. (\"Sepulveda\") is an individual who resides in Texas.\n\n        5.      On April 8, 2013, Weaver & Jacobs entered into a prime contract with Taft\n\nIndependent School District (\"TISD\") for the Taft Independent School District High School\n\nImprovements, Taft, Texas (the \"Project\").\n\n        6.      TISO is the owner of the Project, and Weaver & Jacobs agreed to act as the\n\nConstruction Manager at Risk for the construction of a new front office. among other improvements.\n\n        7.      Weaver & Jacobs issued a Notice of Requests for Proposals from Subcontractors and\n\nSuppliers (the \"Requests for Proposals\").\n\n        8.      In the Requests for Proposals, Weaver & Jacobs requested bid offers from\n\nsubcontractors and suppliers indicating the price for which they would be willing to perfonn certain\n\nscopes of work on, or to supply materials to, the Project.\n\n        9.     All bid offers were required to be submitted to Weaver & Jacobs by June 26, 2013.\n\n        10.     On June 26, 2013, at 2:09 p.m., Sepulveda, who is a project manager for Air Jireh,\n\nsent an e-mail to Weaver & Jacobs.\n\n        11.

The Original Bid included the cost for certain digital controls (the \"Digital Controls\")\n\nto be installed as part of the Work.\n\n        13.    Air JÃ­reh sent with the Original Bid a copy of Air Jireh's rÃ©sumÃ©.\n\n        14.    The Digital Controls were a single-source specification, which means that every offer\n\nto perform the work submitted to Weaver & Jacobs was to include the Digital Controls at the same\n\ncost of$23,561.00.\n\n\nFINDiNGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAWÂ· Page 2                                                             I38554.lI2845.002\n                                                                                                    352\n\f         15.

After Weaver & Jacobs received and compiled all of the subcontractor offers for the\n\nentire Project, it was necessary for Weaver & Jacobs to engage in value engineering to reduce the\n\nProject's price.\n\n         17.       On June 26, 2013, at2:29 p.m., Weaver&Jacohs sent Air Jireh an e-mail asking Air\n\nJireh to confirm that it had included in its Original Bid the Digital Controls at a price of \"around\n\n$25k,\"\n\n         18.

On July 7,2013, at 4:53 p.m., Weaver & Jacobs sent Air Jireh an e-mail informing\n\nAir Jireh that Weaver & Jacobs was replacing the Digital Controls with the Thermostats.\n\n         22.   On July 7,2013, at 6:40 p.m., Air Jireh sent Weaver & Jacobs an e-mail indicating\n\nthat the Original Bid included the Digital Controls at a price of$23,561.00 and three Thermostats at\n\na price of$475 each.\n\n         23.   On July 9, 2013. Air Jireh submitted to Weaver & Jacobs a revised bid offer in the\n\namount of $132,670.00 (the \"Revised Bid\"). However, the Revised Bid's price did not properly\n\nrecognize the full deduction for substituting the Thermostats tor the Digital Controls.\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW ~Page 3                                                              138554.112845.002\n                                                                                                     353\n\f        24.

Weaver & Jacobs informed Air Jireh that it would accept Air Jireh's $125,971.00\n\noffer and would issue a subcontract in the amount of$125,971.00 to Air JÃ­reh to memorialize their\n\nagreement.\n\n       26.     On July 16.2013, Air Jireh sent Weaver & Jacobs an e-mail indicating that Air Jireh\n\nhad \"revised [the] HVAC proposal with programmable t-stats in lieu of the controlsl.]\"\n\n       27.     Attached to Air Jireh' s July 16, 2013, e-mail was Air Jireh' s corrected bid offer (the\n\n\"Corrected Bid Offer\"). which properly substituted the cost of the Digital Controls with the cost of\n\nthe Thermostats, but which was incorrectly dated \"June 26,2013.\"\n\n       28.     In the Corrected Bid Offer, Air Jireh offered to perform the Work in exchange for\n\namount of$125,971.00.\n\n       29.

Weaver & Jacobs accepted the Corrected Bid Offer.\n\n       31.     On July 23, 2013, Weaver & Jacobs sent Air Jireh a subcontract in the amount of\n\n$125,971.00 (the \"Subcontract\"), which communicated Weaver & Jacobs' acceptance of the\n\nCorrected Bid Offer.\n\n       32.     The following provision was included in the Subcontract on page six:\n\n\"EXCLUSIONS: Per quote dated 6/26/13.\"\n\n       33.     On August 5, 2013, Weaver & Jacobs sent an e-mail to all of the Project's\n\nsubcontractors, including Air Jireh, which stated that each recipient had recently contracted with\n\nWeaver & Jacobs.\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LA W â¢ Page 4                                                           138554.1/2845.002\n                                                                                                     354\n\f         34.

On or about August 10,2013, after not receiving a response to the August 5, 2013,\n\nrequest for submittals. Chris Brzozowski (\"Brzozowski\"), Weaver & Jacobs' project manager,\n\ncontacted Air JÃ­reh via telephone to seek assurances that Air JÃ­reh still planned to perform the Work.\n\nDuring the telephone conversation, Sepulveda represented to Weaver & Jacobs that Air Jireh would\n\nperfonn the Work.\n\n         36.   On or about August 15, 2013, Brzozowski again contacted Air JÃ­reh via telephone and\n\nspoke with Sepulveda. During that telephone conversation, Sepulveda represented that Air Jireh\n\nwould neither execute the Subcontract nor perform the Work as it had promised in the Corrected Bid\n\nOffer.\n\n         37.   Weaver & Jacobs was forced to enter into a subcontract with a third party to perform\n\nthe Work for the amount of$142,347.00, which was $16,556.00 more than the amount agreed to by\n\nAir Jireh in the Corrected Bid Offer for the performance of the Work.\n\n         38.

CONCLUSIONS    OF LAW\n\n          39.   A valid, enforceable contract was formed between Weaver & Jacobs and Air Jireh\n\nafter Weaver & Jacobs accepted Air Jireh's Corrected Bid Offer to perform the Work in exchange\n\nfor the sum of$125,791.00. Air JÃ­reh breached its contract with Weaver & Jacobs by refusing to\n\nperform the Work. Air Jireh' s breach of contract caused injury to Weaver & Jacobs in the amount of\n\n$16,556.00. Air Jireh failed to establish by a preponderance orthe evidence that it has any valid\n\nexcuse or defense to liability for its material breach of its contractual obligations to Weaver &\n\nJacobs.\n\n          40.   Air Jireh's Corrected Bid Offer in the amount of$125,971.00 represented Air Jireh's\n\nenforceable promise to perform the Work in exchange for that amount. Air Jireh reasonably foresaw\n\nthat Weaver & Jacobs would act in reliance on the promise, and Weaver & Jacobs did, in fact, rely\n\non the promise to its detriment in calculating the GMP for the Project As a direct and proximate\n\nresult of Air JÃ­reh's refusal to perform the Work as promised, Weaver & Jacobs was damaged in the\n\namount of$16.556.00. Air Jireh failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it has any\n\nvalid excuse or defense to liability for its failure to fulfill its promise to perform the Work.\n\n          41.   Weaver & Jacobs is a consumer under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Tex.\n\nBus. & Com. Code Â§ 17.41 et seq. (the \"DTP A\"), because it is a corporation that sought to purchase\n\nfrom Air Jireh goods and services needed to perform the Work on the Project. Weaver & Jacobs is\n\nthus entitled to all protections afforded to consumers under the DTP A. Air Jireh can be sued under\n\nthe DTP A because it sells and installs HVAC systems and provides service for existing systems. By\n\noffering to perform the Work on the Proj eet in exchange for the sum of $125,971.00, and then orally\n\nrepudiating its proposal, Air Jireh engaged in false, misleading, and deceptive acts in the conduct of\n\nits trade and in violation of Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Â§ 17.46(a). Air Jireh's conduct constitutes false,\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAWÂ· Page 6                                                              138554.1/2845.002\n                                                                                                      356\n\fmisleading, and deceptive acts and practices included in the \"laundry list\" ofDTPA violations. Such\n\n\"laundry list\" violations include (1) advertising goods or services with the intent not to sell them as\n\nadvertised and (2) representing that an agreement confers or involves rights, remedies, or obligations\n\nthat it does not. Weaver & Jacobs relied on Air Jireh's false, misleading, and deceptive acts to its\n\ndetriment by using Air Jireh's proposal to compute its GMP for the Project. Air Jireh's conduct\n\nforced Weaver & Jacobs to contract with another subcontractor at a substantially higher contract\n\nprice than that which was promised by Air Jireh, Air Jireh is the producing cause of Weaver &\n\nJacobs' damages in the amount of$16,5 56.00. Air Jireh failed to establish by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that it has any valid excuse or defense to liability for its false, misleading, and deceptive\n\nacts.\n\n        42.    Sepulveda included with Air JÃ­reh's Original Bid offer a copy Air JÃ­reh's rÃ©sumÃ©.\n\nThe rÃ©sumÃ© contained several false representations, including the assertion that Air JÃ­reh had been\n\ndoing business in the San Antonio area for the past 20 years and a recitation of certain \"most recent\n\njobs.\" Sepulveda also submitted the Corrected Bid Offer to Weaver & Jacobs, in which he\n\nrepresented that Air JÃ­reh would perform the Work in exchange for the sum of$125,971.00. Further,\n\non or about August 10, 2013, Sepulveda represented to Weaver & Jacobs that Air JÃ­reh would\n\nperform the Work as promised in the Corrected Bid Offer. These representations were material in\n\nthat Weaver & Jacobs relied on the representations to make its decision to accept Air Jireh's bid\n\noffer and would not have done so absent the representations. These representations were false.\n\nSepulveda made these representations with knowledge of their falsity or recklessly, as positive\n\nassertions, without knowledge of their truth. Weaver & Jacobs relied on Sepulveda's false\n\nrepresentations in calculating its GMP and, after Air Jireh refused to perform the Work, Weaver &\n\nJacobs was forced to subcontract with a third party to perform the Work, resulting in damages to\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW - Page 7                                                            138554.112845.002\n                                                                                                     357\n\f Weaver& Jacobs in the amount of$16,556.00. Sepulveda failed to establish by a preponderance of\n\n the evidence that he has any valid excuse or defense to liability for his fraudulent representations to\n\nWeaver & Jacobs.\n\n        43.     Sepulveda represented to Weaver & Jacobs that Air Jireh had 20 years' experience\n\ndoing business in the San Antonio area, that Ail'Jireh had performed certain recent jobs, and that Air\n\nJireh would perform the Work in exchange for $125,971.00. These representations were false, and\n\nSepulveda intended that Weaver & Jacobs rely on the representations. Sepulveda failed to exercise\n\nreasonable care or competence in obtaining and communicating these representations. Sepulveda\n\nintended that Weaver & Jacobs use these representations as guidance. Weaver & Jacobs reasonably\n\nand justifiably relied on Sepulveda's false representations to its detriment, resulting in damages to\n\nWeaver & Jacobs in the amount of $16,556.00. Sepulveda failed to establish by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that he has any valid excuse or defense to liability for his negligent misrepresentations\n\nto Weaver & Jacobs.\n\n        44.    All conditions precedent to Weaver & Jacobs' entitlement to recovery have been\n\nperformed. have occurred, or have been excused.\n\n       45.     Weaver & Jacobs has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\ndamages it incurred were reasonable and necessary to perform the Work after Air Jireh refused to\n\nexecute the Subcontract or perform the Work.
