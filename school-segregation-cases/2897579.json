COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                              OPINION\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:\n\n  We must decide whether the United States may retain evi-\ndence it seized from Major League Baseball’s drug testing\nadministrator (and enforce an additional subpoena) as part of\nan ongoing grand jury investigation into illegal steroid use by\nprofessional athletes.\n\n                                    I\n\n   These three consolidated cases arise from the federal inves-\ntigation of the Bay Area Lab Cooperative (“Balco”) and its\nalleged distribution of illegal steroids to professional baseball\nathletes. The investigation began in August 2002 and, over\nthe following several years, produced evidence—including\ngrand jury testimony—establishing probable cause to believe\nthat at least ten major league baseball players received illegal\nsteroids from Balco. Today we decide the government’s\nappeals from the separate adverse orders of three different\ndistrict courts: (1) an order by Judge Florence-Marie Cooper\nin the Central District of California, requiring the government\nto return property seized from Comprehensive Drug Testing,\nInc. in Long Beach, California (“CDT”),1 (2) an order by\nJudge James Mahan in the District of Nevada, requiring the\ngovernment to return property seized from Quest Diagnostics,\nInc. in Las Vegas, Nevada (“Quest”),2 and (3) an order by\nJudge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California,\nquashing the government’s May 6, 2004, subpoenas to CDT\nand Quest that related to the grand jury sitting in San Fran-\ncisco, California.\n  1\n    The courts also required the government to turn over all notes made by\nagents who reviewed the challenged evidence.\n  2\n    Again, the government was also required to give up all notes made by\nreviewing agents.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 19791\n                                     A\n\n   As part of its investigation into Balco, the government in\nNovember 2003 served a grand jury subpoena on Major\nLeague Baseball (“MLB”),3 seeking drug testing information\nfor eleven players4 with connections to Balco. One month\nlater, MLB responded that it had no such information.\n\n   The government then reasoned that because CDT5 and Quest6\nhad tested urine samples from MLB players during 2003,\nthose entities—rather than MLB—had to possess the samples\nand testing records in question. Therefore, the government\nissued subpoenas both to CDT and to Quest, seeking drug\ntesting information for all MLB players. The subpoenas were\nreturnable on February 5, 2004, but the government extended\nthat date to March 4, 2004, after CDT and Quest promised not\nto destroy or to alter any of the evidence requested.\n\n   Despite protracted negotiations, CDT and Quest resisted\nproducing any of the subpoenaed materials, explaining that\nthey would fight production of even a single drug test all the\n  3\n     “Major League Baseball,” an unincorporated association, consists of\ntwo professional baseball leagues—the National League of Professional\nBaseball Clubs and the American League of Professional Baseball Clubs.\n   4\n     The names of the players are under seal and are not disclosed in this\nopinion.\n   5\n     CDT is a third-party administrator of “drug and alcohol testing pro-\ngrams” that was hired to oversee MLB’s drug use evaluation program. The\ncompany includes “top experts in pharmacology, forensic toxicology, lab-\noratory management, medical review, legal, and administrative compli-\nance.” See Comprehensive Drug Testing: About Us, http://\nwww.cdtsolutions.com/about_us.html (last visited Nov. 10, 2006).\n   6\n     Quest offers laboratories that conduct “drugs of abuse testing and ther-\napeutic drug monitoring” with “the most advanced methodologies avail-\nable.” See Quest Diagnostics: Diagnostic Testing & Services, http://\nwww.questdiagnostics.com/brand/business/b_bus_lab_index.html             (last\nvisited Nov. 10, 2006). Quest’s laboratory in Las Vegas performed the\ndrug testing on the player specimens at issue in these consolidated appeals.\n\f19792     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nway to the Supreme Court. Following further negotiations, the\ngovernment, believing that a narrower subpoena might be\neffective, issued new subpoenas on March 3, 2004, seeking\ndocuments related only to eleven7 players with Balco connec-\ntions. These new subpoenas were returnable on April 8, 2004.\n\n   Two days before the new return date, the Major League\nBaseball Players’ Association—the union representing ath-\nletes who play for Major League Baseball8 —informed the\ngovernment that it intended to file a motion to quash the sub-\npoenas. The following day, as promised, CDT and the Play-\ners’ Association filed such a motion in the Northern District\nof California before United States District Judge Jeffrey\nWhite.\n\n                                     B\n\n   After learning of the planned motion to quash, the govern-\nment applied on April 7 and April 8, 2004, for warrants to\nsearch CDT’s Long Beach office and Quest’s Las Vegas labo-\nratory. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Johnson issued a search war-\nrant for the office in his jurisdiction, the Central District of\nCalifornia, and Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leavitt issued a\nsearch warrant for the laboratory in his jurisdiction, the Dis-\ntrict of Nevada.9 Affidavits submitted to support the warrants\nnoted that the information sought was already the subject of\n  7\n     The government later decided not to seek drug testing evidence related\nto one of the eleven players, and on April 22, 2004, sent a letter to the\ncounsel for CDT withdrawing requests for documents related to that\nplayer.\n   8\n     The testing records at issue in these cases were created pursuant to a\ncollective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the\nplayers of Major League Baseball (represented by the Major League Base-\nball Players’ Association).\n   9\n     The pursuit of search warrants in different districts was proper under\nthe applicable federal rule, which gives a magistrate judge the authority\n“to issue a warrant to search for and seize a person or property located\nwithin the district,” “to issue a warrant for a person or property outside the\ndistrict if the person or property is located within the district when the\nwarrant is issued but might move or be moved outside the district before\nthe warrant is executed,” or “in an investigation of domestic terrorism or\ninternational terrorism . . . [to] issue a warrant for a person or property\nwithin or outside that district.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b).\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19793\ngrand jury subpoenas and that a motion to quash was expected.10\nContrary to appellee’s arguments, the government never\nclaimed in its affidavits that any evidence was in danger of\nbeing destroyed.11\n\n   The April 7 and April 8 warrants authorized the seizure of\ndrug test records and specimens for ten named Balco-\nconnected players, as well as “[a]ll manuals, pamphlets, book-\nlets, contracts, agreements and any other materials detailing or\nexplaining” CDT’s or Quest’s “administration of Major\nLeague Baseball’s drug testing program.”12 The warrants also\nauthorized the search of computer equipment, computer stor-\nage devices, and—where an on-site search would be\nimpracticable—seizure of either a copy of all data or the com-\nputer equipment itself. “[L]aw enforcement personnel trained\nin searching and seizing computer data” (designated “com-\nputer personnel”) were responsible for choosing the appropri-\nate course of action to capture the electronic data sought. If\nseizure of all data or equipment was necessary, “appropriately\ntrained personnel” would review the data, retaining the evi-\ndence authorized by the warrant and designating the remain-\nder for return.\n\n   On the morning of April 8, 2004, Special Agent Jeff\nNovitzky (the lead case agent) and eleven other federal agents\n—including Computer Investigative Specialist Agent Joseph\nAbboud—executed the search warrant for CDT’s Long Beach\noffice. Although CDT personnel were initially cooperative,\n   10\n      The affidavit for the search warrant in the District of Nevada advised\nthe court that Quest “intend[ed] to move to quash the subpoena.” Later,\nthat language was crossed out and replaced with a handwritten note: “A\nmotion to quash has been filed. 4.7.04,” followed by Judge Leavitt’s ini-\ntials.\n   11\n      See infra Section III.A.2.\n   12\n      The April 8 warrant also expressly authorized the seizure of “corre-\nspondence” and “e-mails” detailing or explaining Quest’s administration\nof the drug testing program.\n\f19794     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\none of CDT’s directors—after speaking with counsel—\ninformed Agent Novitzky that CDT would not assist federal\nofficers in locating the evidence they were authorized to seize\nand that the agents should “do what they needed to do.” When\ninformed that agents might be forced to seize all computer\nequipment for up to sixty days, the director again contacted\ncounsel, exclaiming that such a seizure would “shut[ ] the\nbusiness down.”\n\n   Throughout the morning and early afternoon, Agent\nNovitzky spoke several times with CDT’s attorney, David\nBancroft. Bancroft asked Agent Novitzky not to seize any-\nthing while he attempted to work out a beneficial solution\nwith the United States Attorney’s Office in San Francisco.\nLater, Bancroft told the agent that CDT had only one hard-\ncopy document eligible for seizure. Around noon, both Agent\nNovitzky and Assistant United States Attorney Jeff Nedrow\nspoke with Bancroft and CDT’s directors via conference call.\nBancroft emphasized that any help CDT provided should not\nbe construed to constitute consent and then informed Nedrow\nand Agent Novitzky that CDT had two computers on which\nagents would find information relevant to the search warrant.\n\n   During this conference call, Agent Novitzky learned that\nagents had discovered a hard-copy document with names and\nidentifying numbers for all MLB players, including some of\nthe ten named Balco players. Agent Novitzky faxed the docu-\nment, which was not the “only document eligible for seizure”\nto which Bancroft had alluded, to Nedrow for preparation of\nanother search warrant to seize specimen samples from Quest\nbased on the identifying numbers.13 One of CDT’s directors\n  13\n     A separate group of federal agents had simultaneously executed a sep-\narate search warrant at Quest’s Las Vegas laboratory, but they were unable\nto locate the specimens to be seized, because the specimens were identi-\nfied by number only. Agents used the master list from CDT to apply for\na third search warrant. The new warrant for Quest was authorized by\nJudge Leavitt in the District of Nevada at 6 p.m. that evening, and agents\nseized the then-identifiable Balco players’ specimens later that same night.\nThis opinion focuses on the search of CDT, because the motions for return\nof property were premised on the government’s conduct during that\nsearch.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             19795\nbecame visibly upset when she noticed the document being\nfaxed. She left the premises, but when she returned, she\nopened a locked drawer and presented agents with a docu-\nment that contained drug testing results for the ten named\nBalco players—the document previously described as the\nonly seizable hard-copy document on site.14\n\n   At 2:35 p.m., a CDT director finally identified a computer\ndirectory containing all of the computer files for CDT’s sports\ndrug testing programs. This directory, labeled by its original\ncompiler as the “Tracey” directory, contained numerous sub-\ndirectories and hundreds of files. Seeing this, Agent Abboud\nrecommended copying the entire directory for off-site analy-\nsis, because of the time and intrusiveness involved in search-\ning the voluminous directory on site. Knowing that the\nwarrant required them to rely upon the advice of a computer\nanalyst—here the advice of Computer Investigative Specialist\nAgent Joseph Abboud—agents copied the directory and\nremoved the copy for later review at government offices.\n\n   The search of the CDT facility concluded shortly after 5\np.m., but before he left the premises, Agent Novitzky\nreviewed with CDT directors the evidence seized during the\nsearch. The documents seized included a twenty-five-page\nmaster list of all MLB players tested during the 2003 season\nand a thirty-four-page list of positive drug testing results for\neight of the ten named Balco players, intermingled with posi-\ntive results for twenty-six other players.15\n  14\n    Some time later, agents located a billing document for CDT’s off-site\nLong Beach storage locker. After agents obtained a fourth warrant, which\nallowed them to search and seize evidence in the locker, a CDT director\nagreed to open the compartment for the agents.\n  15\n   Copies of all seized documents were provided to CDT by the govern-\nment on April 16, 2004.\n\f19796     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                     C\n\n   Upon returning to his office in San Jose, California, Agent\nNovitzky briefly reviewed the contents of the Tracey direc-\ntory, identifying five subdirectories related to MLB. Within\nthese directories, Agent Novitzky identified files authorized\nby magistrate judges for seizure, including the master file of\npositive drug test results.16 On April 26, 2004, the Players’\n  16\n     On April 30, the government applied for a fifth search warrant in the\nNorthern District of California, asking for authorization to “seize” all elec-\ntronic data “regarding drug specimens, drug testing, specimen identifica-\ntion numbers, athlete identification numbers, and drug test results, retained\nby [CDT] . . . pertaining to the drug testing of Major League Baseball\nplayers, located within the copy of a CDT computer sub-directory cur-\nrently in the possession of the [Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)] in San\nJose, California, identified as the ‘Tracey’ sub-directory, bearing the fol-\nlowing computer file group names: (1) ‘MAJOR LEAGUE GROUP’ (2)\n‘MLB BILLING’ (3) ‘MLB Drug SubCommittee’ (4) ‘MLB Follow UP’\n(5) ‘MLB IOC.’ ” Because this copy of the Tracey directory was in the\nhands of the IRS in San Jose, in the Northern District of California, the\ngovernment sought the search warrant in that district. Magistrate Judge\nHoward Lloyd approved the warrant. The government did not notify CDT,\npresumably because the IRS already had in its possession the copy of the\nentire directory containing the relevant materials.\n   The Players’ Association subsequently filed a Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g)\nmotion in the Northern District of California seeking return of any prop-\nerty taken pursuant to the April 30 search warrant, and on August 9, 2004,\nJudge Illston granted this motion. The government did not appeal the order\nand does not dispute it now. Instead, the government asserts that it retains\nthe right to review the Tracey directory based upon the April 7 search war-\nrants, a contention we address in this consolidated appeal.\n   Insofar as the dissent suggests that the pursuit of the April 30 search\nwarrant evidences bad faith harassment by the government and an attempt\nto evade a possibly adverse order on the motion for return of property filed\nin the Central District of California, we decline to speculate. We have no\nreason to believe that the government sought the April 30 warrant for pur-\nposes of harassment, rather than to avoid an additional search of CDT that\nwould have followed from authorization to seize the original copy in the\nCentral District. Since no district court has ever held an evidentiary hear-\ning, and the government complied with the commands of the criminal\nrules to secure search warrants from the magistrate judges in whose dis-\ntricts the property was located, based upon a showing of probable cause\nthat incriminating evidence would be found, we see no signs of bad faith\nto support the district courts’ contrary conclusion.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            19797\nAssociation filed motions under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 41(g)17 seeking return of the property seized.\n\n   On May 5, using information culled from the Tracey direc-\ntory, the government applied for new search warrants to seize\nall specimens and records relating to the over-one hundred\nnon-Balco players who had tested positive for steroids. Mag-\nistrate Judge Leavitt in the District of Nevada authorized sei-\nzure of the specimens from Quest, and Magistrate Judge\nRosalyn M. Chapman in the Central District of California\nauthorized the seizure of records from CDT. Again, the gov-\nernment sought and obtained each warrant from the district\ncourt whose jurisdiction encompassed the situs of the property\nto be searched, as directed by Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b).18 The\ngovernment executed the warrants on May 6, and the Players’\nAssociation immediately filed Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) motions\nseeking return of the specimens and records seized.\n\n   On August 19, 2004, Judge Mahan granted the Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 41(g) motion brought by the Players’ Association in\nthe District of Nevada and ordered the government to return\nall specimens seized from Quest and all notes and memoranda\ncompiled by agents who reviewed the evidence, other than\nthose pertaining to the ten Balco players named in the original\nsearch warrant.19 He made findings—without conducting an\n  17\n    Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) reads:\n      Motion To Return Property. A person aggrieved by an unlawful\n      search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property\n      may move for the property’s return. The motion must be filed in\n      the district where the property was seized. The court must receive\n      evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If\n      it grants the motion, the court must return the property to the\n      movant, but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access\n      to the property and its use in later proceedings.\n   18\n      See supra note 9.\n   19\n      The government moved for a stay of this order because the evidence\nwas otherwise lawfully in its possession pursuant to the subpoena of May\n6, 2004. Judge Mahan denied the motion on November 1, 2004, based on\nthe government’s failure to raise the subpoena argument at the original\nhearing.\n\f19798     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nevidentiary hearing—that “[t]he government callously disre-\ngarded the affected players’ constitutional rights” and that the\ngovernment unreasonably refused “to follow the procedures\nset forth in United States v. Tamura, 694 F.2d 591 (9th Cir.\n1982),” with regard to the intermingled records. Almost six\nweeks later, and again without conducting an evidentiary\nhearing, Judge Cooper rejected the government’s suggestion\nthat the documents were seizable under the warrant exception\nthat applies to plain-view evidence of contraband,20 and\ngranted the Players’ Association’s Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g)\nmotion in the Central District of California. The order, which\nalso cited the government’s failure to follow Tamura’s proce-\ndures, mandated return to CDT of any evidence seized that\nwas not connected to the ten players named in the warrant.\nJudge Cooper denied the government’s motion for reconsider-\nation of this order on February 9, 2005.\n\n  These orders are the subjects of two of the appeals consoli-\ndated here.\n\n                                     D\n\n   The third appeal concerns grand jury subpoenas issued to\nQuest and CDT on May 6, 2004, which were to be returned\nby June 10, 2004. These subpoenas reached all specimens and\nrecords of positive steroid drug tests for more than one hun-\ndred MLB players, not simply the results for the ten Balco\nplayers named in the earlier subpoenas.21 This evidence was\n   20\n      We discuss the inapplicability of this warrant exception in Section\nIII.A.4. See infra note 39.\n   21\n      These subpoenas were not the earliest ones issued in the investigation.\nThe first subpoenas dated to January 16, 2004, and mandated the provision\nof all MLB drug testing records. On March 3, 2004, the government\nobtained narrower subpoenas for eleven Balco-connected players.\n   On April 22, 2004, the government sent a letter to CDT withdrawing the\nJanuary 2004 subpoenas. In the same letter, the government reduced the\nMarch 3, 2004, subpoenas to ten, not eleven, Balco players. At the time\nthe government obtained the May 6 subpoenas, the only outstanding sub-\npoenas were those of March 3, which sought the records of ten players\nwith Balco connections.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19799\nalso pursued in the government’s May 5 search warrants. The\ngovernment sought these later search warrants and subpoenas\non the ground that the April 8 seizures did not provide all\ninformation needed for the investigation.22\n\n   Quest complied with the May 6 subpoena, providing the\ngovernment with hundreds of pages of documents, but the\ngovernment agreed to defer CDT’s compliance pending reso-\nlution of the search warrant litigation. On August 31, 2004,\nhowever, the government revoked the indefinite deferral and\ninstructed CDT to comply with the subpoena by September\n14, 2004. The Players’ Association filed a motion to quash the\nsubpoenas on September 13, 2004.\n\n   In December 2004, after Judge Illston heard argument on\nthe motion but took no testimony, she found that the govern-\nment’s conduct was unreasonable and constituted harassment.\nShe then filed an order quashing the subpoenas, which the\ngovernment timely appealed.\n\n                                    II\n\n  Before we review the orders granting the Fed. R. Crim. P.\n41(g) motions in the Central District of California and the\nDistrict of Nevada, we must decide two jurisdictional issues:\nwhether the Players’ Association has standing to challenge the\nsearch and seizure of evidence from Quest and whether the\ngovernment timely appealed Judge Cooper’s order to return\n  22\n     Recognizing that the documents they seized from CDT pursuant to the\nApril 7 search warrant might not have included all documents relevant to\nthe investigation (even with regard to Balco-related players, see infra note\n37), and deciding that the positive test results uncovered for MLB players\nbeyond the ten with Balco connections could be valuable to the investiga-\ntion, the government asked for a broader warrant on May 6 in the Central\nDistrict of California.\n\f19800     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nthe materials seized from CDT in the Central District of Califor-\nnia.23\n\n                                    A\n\n   The government contends that the Players’ Association\nlacks standing to file the Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) motion,\nbecause it lacked access, control, and ownership over the\nrecords and specimens seized from Quest. Furthermore, it\nargues that the Players’ Association may not base its interest\nin the property (the urine specimens and test results) on the\nprivacy interests of the individual players.24\n\n   [1] An association has standing to sue on behalf of its\nmembers when they would otherwise have independent stand-\ning to sue, the interests sought to be protected are germane to\nthe organization’s purpose, and the claim asserted does not\nrequire the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\nPennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U.S. 1, 7 n.3 (1988) (citations\nomitted); see also Hunt v. Wash. Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432\nU.S. 333, 343 (1977).\n  23\n      We need not decide whether the Players’ Association has standing to\nchallenge the CDT seizures because CDT is a party and has standing on\nits own to seek return of the property seized from its office and storage\nlocker.\n   24\n      The Supreme Court has clearly rejected “vicarious” or “target” stand-\ning to assert Fourth Amendment rights. See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S.\n128, 133-34 (1978) (refusing to extend standing to a party who was not\na “victim” of the search); see also United States v. Taketa, 923 F.2d 665,\n669-70 (9th Cir. 1991) (following Rakas, 439 U.S. at 134, and holding that\na defendant did not have standing to challenge a search of another defen-\ndant’s office). “A person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure\nonly through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search\nof a third person’s premises or property has not had any of his Fourth\nAmendment rights infringed.” Rakas, 439 U.S. at 134 (emphasis added).\nBecause we are satisfied that the Players’ Association has met the require-\nments of associational standing, we do not reach its argument that it has\nan ownership interest in the seized items sufficient to establish standing\nin its own right. We leave that question for another day.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19801\n   [2] We are satisfied that the Players’ Association satisfies\neach prong of this test. First, the Players’ Association repre-\nsents all MLB players, each one of whom could certainly sue\nin his own right to seek return of his own drug test records.\nSecond, the interests sought to be protected—the players’ pri-\nvacy interests in their drug testing records—are related to the\norganization’s sole purpose: to represent the best interests of\nMLB players. Third, the Players’ Association sought only the\nreturn of the players’ drug testing information and specimens;\nfor this type of prospective relief, the individual players need\nnot be a party to the action. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.\n490, 515 (1975) (holding that an association lacked standing\nwhere it sought damages rather than “a declaration, injunc-\ntion, or some other form of prospective relief”).\n\n   [3] We therefore conclude that the Players’ Association has\nstanding to assert the Fourth Amendment rights of its mem-\nbers and to file Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) motions seeking return\nof seized property in which their members hold privacy inter-\nests.\n\n                               B\n\n   [4] The Players’ Association, for its part, contends that the\ngovernment failed to appeal in a timely manner Judge Coo-\nper’s order for the return of property. In order to be timely\nwhen the United States, its officer, or its agency is a party, a\nnotice of appeal must be filed “within 60 days after the judg-\nment or order appealed from [was] entered.” Fed. R. App. P.\n4(a)(1)(B). Where a district court entertains a motion for\nreconsideration, the 60-day period is tolled until the motion is\ndecided. See Scott v. Younger, 739 F.2d 1464, 1467 (9th Cir.\n1984) (noting that a timely filed motion “tolls the running of\nthe time limitations for filing the notice of appeal until the\ndistrict court rules on the motion”).\n\n   The “United States’ Motion for Reconsideration and Modi-\nfication of Court’s October 1, 2004 Order Granting Return of\n\f19802   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nProperty” was filed on November 19, 2004. In its opposition\nto that motion, the Players’ Association stated that the “gov-\nernment neither invoke[d] nor satisfie[d] any of the require-\nments of Local Rule 7-18 [“Motion for Reconsideration”] to\nsupport its request for reconsideration.” The appellees’ reply\nbrief suggests that the motion was merely “styled as one for\nreconsideration,” and does not actually qualify as such\nbecause the motion only “asked the court to water down its\nfindings” without claiming that “the Court failed to evaluate\nthe merits.”\n\n   We disagree. Like the dissent, we believe the motion was\nproperly construed as one for reconsideration. Unlike the dis-\nsent, however, we apply the local rule governing motions for\nreconsideration, and do not recharacterize the motion as a\nrequest for “Relief from Judgment or Order” under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 60(b) (“Rule 60(b)”).\n\n  [5] The motion falls squarely within the definition of a\n“Motion for Reconsideration” under C.D. Cal. Local R. 7-18\n(“Local Rule 7-18”). Judge Cooper recognized this when she\nchose to analyze the motion under Local Rule 7-18. This anal-\nysis was proper, for Local Rule 7-18 permits a party to bring\na “Motion for Reconsideration” on the basis of a “manifest\nshowing of a failure to consider material facts presented to the\nCourt before such decision.” C.D. Cal. Local R. 7-18(c). The\ngovernment made its motion on precisely these grounds.\n\n   The dissent agrees that Local Rule 7-18 applies to such\nmotions, and correctly notes that the “Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure do not provide for ‘Motions for Reconsideration.’ ”\nDissent at 19858. Instead, “such motions are creatures of local\nrule or practice.” Id. The dissent then points out a caveat:\n“Where a conflict arises between the two, federal rules must\nprevail.” Id. (citations omitted). From this point, the dissent\ndraws a far more sweeping conclusion: “For the purposes of\nappeal, when a local rule based post-judgment motion for\nreconsideration is made, we construe it either as (1) a motion\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               19803\nto alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59(e) or (2) a motion\nfiled under 60(b) for relief from judgment.” Dissent at 19859\n(citing Am. Ironworks & Erectors v. N. Am. Constr. Corp.,\n248 F.3d 892, 898 99 (9th Cir. 2001)). So broad a conclusion\nis not justified. Am. Ironworks does not even mention a local\nrule in its discussion of Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b). The case\nsimply addresses which federal rule to apply to a motion not\nalready treated as a motion for reconsideration under a local\nrule.\n\n   Even more problematically, the dissent places the cart\nbefore the horse by assuming an inconsistency between the\nfederal and local rules before stating which federal rule even\napplies.25 We decline so hastily to dispose of a local rule.\n“Local rules are ‘laws of the United States,’ ” Marshall v.\nGates, 44 F.3d 722 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v.\nHvass, 355 U.S. 570, 575 (1958)), and “valid if . . . ‘not\ninconsistent’ with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,’ ” id.\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 83). Unlike the dissent, we look to the\ntext of the rules in order to discern whether such an inconsis-\ntency exists. Rule 60(b) reads:\n\n       On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court\n       may relieve a party or a party’s legal representative\n       from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the\n       following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, sur-\n       prise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered\n       evidence which by due diligence could not have\n       been discovered in time to move for a new trial\n       under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore\n       denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresenta-\n  25\n     An initial analysis of the specific local and federal rules is necessary\nin order to decide whether the rules conflict. Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)\ndiffer greatly, and a local rule that appears inconsistent with one may well\nbe consistent with the other. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) (“Motion to Alter\nor Amend Judgment. Any motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be\nfiled no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.”); see infra at\n19803-04 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)).\n\f19804      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n       tion, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the\n       judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satis-\n       fied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment\n       upon which it is based has been reversed or other-\n       wise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the\n       judgment should have prospective application; or (6)\n       any other reason justifying relief from the operation\n       of the judgment.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). In contrast, Local Rule 7-18 provides:\n\n       A motion for reconsideration of the decision on any\n       motion may be made only on the grounds of (a) a\n       material difference in fact or law from that presented\n       to the Court before such decision that in the exercise\n       of reasonable diligence could not have been known\n       to the party moving for reconsideration at the time of\n       such decision, or (b) the emergence of new material\n       facts or a change of law occurring after the time of\n       such decision, or (c) a manifest showing of a failure\n       to consider material facts presented to the Court\n       before such decision.\n\nC.D. Cal. Local R. 7-18 (emphasis added). The government’s\nmotion clearly falls under Local Rule 7-18(c), because, as the\ndissent points out, the government “assert[ed] that the court\nhad ignored evidence and arguments.” Dissent at 19863. In\ncontrast, the motion does not fall within Rule 60(b), for the\ngovernment did not request relief “from the operation of the\njudgment” but simply and expressly asked the court to “re-\nconsider and modify several aspects of this order which inac-\ncurately characterize the government’s actions.”26\n\n   The government neither requested Rule 60(b) relief nor\ncited the grounds for such relief, which include “mistake,\n  26\n   For the same reason, the motion is not one to “alter or amend the judg-\nment” under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\n\f           UNITED STATES v.

R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(6). In the\nabsence of a clear inconsistency between the local and federal\nrules, we will not apply a general federal rule where a specific\nlocal rule is directly on point. As the dissent aptly points out,\n“[w]e are . . . under an obligation to construe local rules so\nthat they do not conflict with the federal rules, and we have\nexercised our ingenuity in doing so.” Marshall, 44 F.3d at 725.27\n\n   [6] Satisfied that the district court correctly analyzed the\nmotion under Local Rule 7-18, we turn to its timeliness, in\norder to decide whether it tolled the period to file an appeal.\nLocal Rule 7-18 does not expressly set a time frame in which\nto file a motion for reconsideration. However, the rule has\nbeen read to “provid[e] for a reasonable time within which to\nseek reconsideration.” Meredeth v. Erath, 2001 WL 1729626,\n*1 (C.D. Cal.) (Cooper, J.) (defining the relevant period for\nfiling a “Motion for Reconsideration” under then-C.D. Cal.\nLocal R. 7-16, the same rule now codified as C.D. Local R.\n7-18). In Meredeth, the district judge—the same Judge Coo-\nper whose order is appealed here—found that an eleven-\nmonth delay in filing a motion for reconsideration was unrea-\n  27\n     Marshall does not hold that the possibility of conflict between local\nand federal rules should be avoided by ignoring the local rule. Indeed, in\nMarshall the court found the local rule applicable, although “the local rule\nappear[ed] to be inconsistent with the federal rule governing summary\njudgment to the extent that it bars a party from submitting affidavits in\nopposition to summary judgment prior to the day of the hearing.” 44 F.3d\nat 724. The court “engage[d] in an interpretation in order to produce con-\nsistency,” id. at 725, and concluded that the federal rule “d[id] not uncon-\nditionally require a district court to accept affidavits up to the date set for\nhearing on the motion for summary judgment.” Id. Marshall avoided con-\nflict by refusing to interpret the federal rule in a way that would render\ninvalid the local rule. Harmonizing federal and local rules may often leave\nboth intact.\n\f19806     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nsonable, making the motion untimely under Local Rule 7-18.\nId. In contrast, Judge Cooper did not conclude that the two-\nmonth delay in the motion here was unreasonable and did not\nview the government’s motion in this case as untimely\n(although the government advised her that it had filed “out-\nside of the normal time frame”). We agree with her determi-\nnation that the shorter delay here was reasonable. One factor\nsupporting its “reasonableness” is that neither the government\nnor the movants received the order until November 2, 2004.\nGiven these circumstances, we do not believe Judge Cooper’s\ndecision to hear the motion was impermissible under the “rea-\nsonable time” period permitted under Local Rule 7-18. See\nMeredeth, 2001 WL 1729626, at *1.\n\n   [7] Thus, we are satisfied that the motion for reconsidera-\ntion was timely filed. Judge Cooper denied the motion on\nFebruary 9, 2005, tolling the deadline for any appeal until\nApril 9, 2005. The government filed its appeal on March 9,\n2005, with thirty days remaining before the filing deadline.\nThe timely nature of that appeal, and of the motion for recon-\nsideration before it, gives us jurisdiction to consider the origi-\nnal order.28\n\n                                    III\n\n   The government contends that Judge Cooper and Judge\n  28\n    The dissent takes a curious position, at once arguing that “the district\ncourt did not have jurisdiction to consider the original motion” and at the\nsame time stating that the district court’s denial of the motion for\nreconsideration—following a three-page discussion of the merits of the\nmotion—was “proper.” In the absence of jurisdiction, a discussion of the\nmerits is inappropriate. See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449\nU.S. 368, 379 (1981) (noting the familiar rule that a “court lacks discretion\nto consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction”). In\nthe absence of jurisdiction, dismissal—not denial on the merits—is appro-\npriate.\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               19807\nMahan improperly exercised equitable discretion to hear and\nto grant the respective Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) motions.29\n\n  A district court may exercise equitable jurisdiction to hear\nsuch motions only after analyzing the four factors set out in\nRamsden v. United States, 2 F.3d 322 (9th Cir. 1993). Specifi-\ncally, the court must consider\n\n       1) whether the Government displayed a callous dis-\n       regard for the constitutional rights of the movant; 2)\n       whether the movant has an individual interest in and\n       need for the property he wants returned; 3) whether\n       the movant would be irreparably injured by denying\n       return of the property; and 4) whether the movant\n       has an adequate remedy at law for the redress of his\n       grievance.\n\nId. at 325. Both district courts here found that all four factors\nweighed in favor of equitable jurisdiction.\n\n   Because the government now concedes that the parties have\nno adequate remedy at law, we only need to discuss the first\nthree Ramsden factors.\n\n                                    A\n\n   Interestingly, the Players’ Association does not challenge\nthe validity of the warrants authorizing the April 8 searches.\nThus, we assume that probable cause existed to support issu-\nance of the search warrants for the property to be seized from\nthe places named in each warrant. Nevertheless, the Players’\nAssociation defends the grant of its motions for return of\n  29\n    We review a district court’s decision to exercise equitable jurisdiction\nunder Fed. R. Crim.

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nproperty, arguing that the government acted in callous disre-\ngard of the Fourth Amendment rights of the Players’ Associa-\ntion, the MLB players, and CDT, offering a farrago of\narguments to that end. We consider each in turn.\n\n                                    1\n\n   [8] The Players’ Association first argues that the govern-\nment sought search warrants in an attempt to avoid judicial\nreview of the overboard January 2004 subpoenas. We are\naware of no authority that the simultaneous pursuit of search\nwarrants and subpoenas in aid of an ongoing grand jury inves-\ntigation constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\nNeither can we accept that the government could not have\nobtained and executed a search warrant had the January sub-\npoenas been quashed. The government argues—and we have\npreviously recognized—that subpoenas and search warrants\nare not the same. See In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated\nDecember 10, 1987, 926 F.2d 847, 854 (9th Cir. 1991); see\nalso infra Section V. Unlike a subpoena, a search warrant\nmay be obtained only upon a showing of probable cause—a\nburden the government sometimes considers necessary to\nestablish in order to obtain certain production of evidence.30\nIn contrast, a grand jury subpoena may issue simply because\nan Assistant United States Attorney believes the evidence\nmay assist the grand jury in furthering the progress of an\nongoing investigation which may never establish probable\ncause to charge anyone. The “[grand jury] . . . has the right\nto every man’s evidence,” United States v. Calandra, 414\nU.S. 338, 345 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted; sec-\nond alteration in original), and an indictment may be obtained\n  30\n     Significantly, while a subpoena may be quashed, a “person to be\nsearched has no lawful way to prevent execution of the warrant.” In re\nGrand Jury Subpoenas Dated December 10, 1987, 926 F.2d at 854.

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 19809\neven on the basis of illegally seized evidence. Id. at 351-52.\nIn any event, persons aggrieved later may litigate the seizure\nand subsequent use of the evidence, as provided in the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure. We fail to see how the govern-\nment’s compliance with the procedural and evidentiary bur-\ndens necessary to obtain a search warrant from a neutral and\ndetached magistrate can be interpreted as callous disregard of\nthe Fourth Amendment.\n\n                                      2\n\n  Next, the Players’ Association accuses the government of\nmaking “misleading representations” in applying for the\nsearch warrants. In her October 1 order, Judge Cooper\naccepted this argument, finding that:\n\n     [I]n seeking the warrant (not the correct procedure\n     for obtaining documents from a third party who is\n     not a suspect), the Government explained to the\n     Magistrate that the records in question were in dan-\n     ger of being destroyed. This is a blatant misrepresen-\n     tation, as demonstrated by the records in this case.\n\nUnfortunately, Judge Cooper’s conclusion misstates estab-\nlished Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,31 under which “valid\nwarrants may be issued to search any property, whether or not\n   31\n      To the extent that Judge Cooper relied on any failure by the govern-\nment to comply with the United States Attorney’s Manual, such reliance\nis unwarranted. The Manual “does not create any substantive or proce-\ndural rights,” United States v. Fernandez, 231 F.3d 1240, 1246 (9th Cir.\n2000), and thus any violation of procedures established therein cannot\nindependently establish a Fourth Amendment violation. We do not suggest\nthat deviations from United States Attorney’s Manual have no signifi-\ncance. Rather, we conclude that such deviations in the case at bar do not\nrise to the level of a constitutional or statutory violation that would render\ngranting a motion for return of property appropriate. It certainly does not\nsupport an order depriving the grand jury of the use of such evidence in\naid of its expanded criminal investigation.\n\f19810    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\noccupied by a third party, at which there is probable cause to\nbelieve that fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of a crime\nwill be found.” Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 554\n(1978).\n\n   [9] More importantly, Judge Cooper’s finding derives no\nsupport from the record. Magistrate Judge Johnson expressly\nfound to the contrary, and neither judge heard any evidence\nfrom witnesses as the Player’s Association had urged. In\napplying for the search warrants in this case, the government\nnever informed any judge that evidence was in danger of\nbeing destroyed. Remarkably, despite its submission of four-\nteen volumes of supplemental excerpts of record, the Players’\nAssociation provides only a solitary citation to show such\n“blatant misrepresentation.” Tellingly, the only arguable allu-\nsion to destruction of evidence is found in the government’s\nopposition to the Players’ Association’s Fed. R. Crim. P.\n41(g) motion—made after execution of the search warrants,\nnot to obtain them. There, the government retrospectively\nexplained that it “had good-faith reasons to believe that CDT\nwas detrimentally delaying the investigation, and that there\nwas some danger of the availability of the sought-after\nrecords being jeopardized.” The government never suggested\nthis concern as a reason for any court to grant a search war-\nrant in the first place. The district court’s finding to the con-\ntrary was clearly erroneous.\n\n   The Players’ Association also accuses the government of\nrepeatedly failing to inform judges from whom search war-\nrants were obtained that CDT was seeking to quash the sub-\npoena. The dissent accepts this argument and paints a picture\nof deliberate concealment. Unfortunately, this picture is not\nsupported by the record. The dissent contends that “[t]he gov-\nernment never brought to the magistrate judge’s attention that\nthere was a motion pending in the Northern District of Cali-\nfornia to quash the grand jury subpoena.” Dissent at 19836.\nHowever, in his search warrant affidavit filed on April 7,\n2004, Agent Novitsky expressly advised the court that “CDT\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             19811\nhas declined to comply with the [March 3 grand jury] sub-\npoena and has stated its intent to attempt to quash the subpoe-\nna.”\n\n   The government had no reason to refer to a pending motion\nto quash the grand jury subpoena, as no such motion was filed\nprior to April 7, 2004. Indeed, Agent Novitsky filed for the\nsearch warrant in the Central District on the same day that\nCDT moved to quash the grand jury subpoena in the Northern\nDistrict.32 Parties must reveal relevant facts, but they are not\nrequired to be prophetic.\n\n   [10] The record reflects similar candor on the part of gov-\nernment agents in the District of Nevada, where the govern-\nment submitted affidavits for a search warrant also on April\n7. There, too, the government advised the court of the existing\nsubpoena as well as Quest’s intention “to move to quash the\nsubpoena.” Alerted to the impending motion to quash, Judge\nLeavitt noted the date when the motion ultimately was filed.33\nAs in the Central District of California, the record contradicts\nany suggestion that the government failed to reveal a pending\nmotion to quash.\n\n                                   3\n\n   The Players’ Association next argues that the government\nused the search warrants for the records of the ten named\nBalco players as a pretext to seize the records of other MLB\nplayers. In support, they cite United States v. Rettig, 589 F.2d\n418 (9th Cir. 1978), where the police obtained a warrant for\nmarijuana paraphernalia after failing a day earlier to obtain a\nwarrant to search for evidence of a cocaine smuggling con-\nspiracy. Id. at 422-23. During the ensuing search, officers told\n  32\n      The record does not contain evidence that the motion to quash was\nfiled in the Northern District early enough in the day for the government\nto know of it before filing its affidavit in the Central District.\n   33\n      See supra note 10.\n\f19812    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nthe suspect’s wife to “tell us where [the cocaine] is so we\ndon’t have to mess up your house.” Id. at 422 n.1.\n\n   Such egregious police misconduct did not occur here.\nAgents executing the warrant at CDT were authorized to seize\nthe drug testing records of the ten named Balco players. In\ntheir lawful search for those records, they found paper and\nelectronic data related to those players, intermingled with data\npertaining to additional MLB players not mentioned in the\nsearch warrant. One document, at issue here, was a spread-\nsheet of positive drug test results, where results for eight of\nthe ten named Balco players were intermingled with results\nfor other MLB players. Because the agents saw that the\nspreadsheet clearly contained information within the scope of\nthe warrant, they seized the spreadsheet for off-site review.\n\n   [11] The record contains no support for the assertion that\nagents specifically targeted and seized records unrelated to the\nplayers mentioned in the search warrant. To the contrary, the\nagents narrowed their seizures to files containing information\non the named Balco players, and during the May 6 search at\nQuest, they seized specimens belonging only to the ten Balco\nplayers. Finally, the agents copied relevant files in order to\navoid an excessively long and intrusive on-site search,\nalthough duplication risked the loss of deleted documents that\nwould only be visible on the original drives.\n\n  [12] We see no evidence of bad faith or pretext here.\n\n                               4\n\n   Nor does the seizure of intermingled documents demon-\nstrate “a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 325 (stating the first factor\nweighing in favor of equitable jurisdiction over a motion for\nreturn of property). In this analysis, we focus on the Fourth\nAmendment and note that “[a]s always under the Fourth\nAmendment, the standard is reasonableness.” United States v.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19813\nHill, 322 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 1088 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (Kozinski,\nCircuit J., sitting by designation). Reasonableness can be\nespecially difficult to define in the computer context, given\nthe well-known “difficulties of examining and separating\nelectronic media at the scene.” Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 1090.\nFortunately, our prior precedent reveals that agents can avoid\nthe opposing errors of leaving behind essential information\nand sweeping up excessive evidence.\n\n   [13] In United States v. Beusch, 596 F.2d 871 (9th Cir.\n1979), this court addressed a motion to suppress seized evi-\ndence consisting of ledgers containing items covered by the\nsearch warrant intermingled with items not covered by the\nsearch warrant. Id. at 876-77. The Beusch court concluded\nthat no Fourth Amendment violation occurred when agents\nseized “single files and single ledgers, i.e., single items which,\nthough theoretically separable, in fact constitute one volume\nor file folder.” Id. at 877.\n\n   The Beusch court expressly limited its reach, however:\n“[T]he reasons we have given for allowing [such] seizure may\nnot apply to sets of ledgers or files, but because that is not the\ncase here, we find it unnecessary to discuss it further.” Id.\nThree years later, the court addressed the seizure of sets of\nfiles. See Tamura, 694 F.2d 591. In Tamura, the court\nreviewed the conduct of officers executing a search warrant,\nwhich authorized seizure of three specific categories of\nrecords from a Los Angeles office. Id. at 594. In that case,\nagents seized—without any limiting effort—files unrelated to\nthe items mentioned in the search warrant. Id. at 595. The\nTamura court condemned such “wholesale seizure for later\ndetailed examination of records not described in a warrant.”\nId.\n\n   Unfortunately, the Tamura court did not answer a more dif-\nficult question: “Because seizable materials are seldom found\nneatly separated from their non-seizable counterparts, how\nmuch separating must police do at the scene to avoid taking\n\f19814      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nitems that are neither contraband nor evidence of criminal\nactivity?” Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 1088. As the Hill court\nnoted, the answer turns upon “reasonableness,” id., a standard\nthat offers little guidance to government agents. Understand-\nably, the Tamura court sought to give more concrete advice\nto help agents remain within the bounds of the Fourth Amend-\nment. The court suggested:\n\n       In the comparatively rare instances where documents\n       are so intermingled that they cannot feasibly be\n       sorted on site, we suggest that the Government and\n       law enforcement officials generally can avoid violat-\n       ing fourth amendment rights by sealing and holding\n       the documents pending approval by a magistrate of\n       a further search, in accordance with the procedures\n       set forth in the American Law Institute’s Model\n       Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure.\n\nTamura, 694 F.2d at 595-96 (emphasis added). Given that the\nTamura court found that the agents had violated Fourth\nAmendment rights by making a “wholesale seizure,” id. at\n595, this alternative, protective approach was advisory dicta\nin that case. See Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 1090 (noting that\nafter the Tamura court “held that the government’s wholesale\nseizure of company documents was illegal because the agents\nintentionally seized materials they knew were not covered by\nthe warrant . . . the Tamura court suggested, albeit in dicta,\nthat [for such seizure of all computer storage media] a warrant\nwould be appropriate.” (emphasis added)).34\n\n  [14] The Tamura court also stated that substitute protective\nprocedures could be specified in a search warrant, pursuant to\nwhich “all items in a set of files may be inspected during a\nsearch.” Id. at 595 (emphasis added). In the cases at bar, the\n  34\n    The Tamura court suggested that the American Law Institute’s Model\nCode of Pre-Arraignment Procedure could guide agents to avoid constitu-\ntional violations. 694 F.3d at 595-96.\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               19815\nsearch warrants spelled out such specific procedures that the\nagents were to follow. We believe that the agents in the cases\nat bar complied with the procedures specified in the warrant:\n\n       Upon searching the premises, law enforcement per-\n       sonnel trained in searching and seizing computer\n       data (the “computer personnel”) . . . [to] make an ini-\n       tial review of any computer equipment and storage\n       devices to determine whether these items can be\n       searched on-site in a reasonable amount of time and\n       without jeopardizing the ability to preserve the data.\n       ...\n\n       If the computer personnel determine that it is not\n       practical to perform an on-site search or make an on-\n       site copy of the data within a reasonable amount of\n       time, then the computer equipment and storage\n       devices will be seized and transported to an appro-\n       priate law enforcement laboratory for review.\n\nThe government executed the warrant under the guidance of\nAgent Abboud—a Computer Investigative Specialist,35 and\ntook care to avoid unreasonable seizures.\n\n   Even so, the Players’ Association contends that the govern-\nment breached the warrant’s protocol, because Agent\nNovitzky opened and viewed the contents of the Tracey direc-\ntory, rather than leaving Agent Abboud to search alone.\nUnder this view, only Agent Abboud qualified as the “appro-\npriately trained personnel” and no other agent had authority\nto open and to view CDT computer data. However, the plain\n  35\n     We note that these requirements are not the mandates of the Fourth\nAmendment. If the warrant had not specified the need for computer ana-\nlysts, police would have been “free to hire such experts to help them con-\nduct a search . . . and it may well be praiseworthy for them to do so. . . .\nBut the Fourth Amendment does not require it.” Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d at\n1088 (citing Tamura and other cases that suggest the involvement of spe-\ncialized personnel) (citations omitted).\n\f19816     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nlanguage of the search warrant does not exclude the assistance\nof other law enforcement officers—especially for tasks\ninvolving non-digital work (such as seeking cooperation from\npersons on site). The warrant only required that computer per-\nsonnel assess the possibility of on site search completion. It\ndid not preclude others from assisting the computer personnel.36\nThe sort of assistance provided by Agent Novitzky, a non-\nspecialized law enforcement officer, was permissible under\nthe search warrant and was reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\n   [15] Moreover, the agents did not remove files without a\nrelation to the Balco investigation and did not seize entire cat-\negories of documents to coerce employees into cooperation,\nas did the agents in Tamura. See 694 F.2d at 595. Their ulti-\nmate decision to remove a relevant number of files for off-site\nreview stemmed not from disregard of privacy rights, but\nfrom sensitivity to the ongoing disruption caused by the\nsearch to CDT—an innocent third party in the underlying\n  36\n    We do not believe that the warrant can be fairly read to require com-\nputer personnel to execute all aspects of the search. For example, the more\nbasic computer recoveries could easily be completed by nonspecialized\nlaw enforcement officers, considering that the type of files at issue were\nsimple spreadsheets. In today’s world anyone with the most rudimentary\ncomputer skills qualifies as “appropriately trained” when it comes to open-\ning and viewing basic spreadsheets on a modern computer: presumably\nany computer user can double-click a selected document or press the\n“Enter” key after selecting the desired file.\n   We recognize that, had CDT stored test results in a Relational Database\nManagement System requiring specialized expertise to extract data, only\nan agent specifically trained in using such a system might be considered\n“appropriately trained.” However, we do not interpret the warrant to\nrequire only Computer Investigative Specialists to perform elementary\ntasks such as scan a spreadsheet for the persons named in a search warrant,\nparticularly when, in the end, the spreadsheets would still have been\nseized. The search warrant form employed in these cases authorized a\nsearch by “Any Special Agent[s] with the United States Internal Revenue\nService or any other authorized officer,” and was not restricted to searches\nonly by computer investigative specialists.\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 19817\ninvestigation. The agents permitted CDT to retain the original\nTracey directory, even though they later explained that this\ndecision may have prevented them from accessing deleted or\ntemporary files that could not be transferred by duplication.37\nThe agents took only a limited set of clearly relevant disks\nand a copy of the Tracey directory, which included informa-\ntion on players specifically named in the search warrant. Fur-\nthermore, just eight days after the search warrant, the agents\nprovided copies of all seized documents to CDT. Here again,\nthe agents demonstrated the careful regard absent in Tamura.38\n\n   We reject the dissent’s view that government officials\nshould limit their computer searches to key words suggested\nby a searched party. Criticizing the government for “cop[y-\ning] the entire directory” rather than “copying only the subdi-\nrectories that pertained to Major League Baseball,” the dissent\nsuggests that the government should have trusted CDT to\n   37\n      Recognizing that the documents they seized on April 8 may not have\nincluded all documents relevant to the investigation, Agent Novitzky\nasked for a broader warrant on May 5 in the Central District of California.\nHe explained that “IRS Special Agent Jeff Jack, a Computer Investigative\nSpecialist . . . gave me specific examples of deleted files or temporary files\ncreated when printing a file that cannot be[ ] seen or retrieved from a sim-\nple copy of a computer sub-directory, but may be retrievable using foren-\nsic tools, if allowed to examine the entire computer system.” Had the\ngovernment engaged in a “wholesale seizure” of all possibly relevant\nmaterial, as in Tamura, they surely would have seized the entire comput-\ners, rather than made duplicates so as to allow CDT to continue its use of\nthe originals. See also United States v. Scott-Emuakpor, 2000 WL 288443,\n*8 (W.D. Mich.) (“[T]he agents were not confined to searching the files\non the hard drive and disks but could also lawfully search for deleted\nmaterial . . . the seizure of [items other than hard drives and disks] was\nreasonable because it allowed the agents to preserve the computer system\nas it existed for the computer analysts . . . without taking the risk of losing\nany files.”).\n   38\n      In Tamura, the agents retained master volumes they knew held infor-\nmation not covered by the search warrant “for at least six months after\nlocating the relevant documents.” Tamura, 694 F.2d at 597. In contrast,\nthe agents in the cases at bar never seized the master hardware with the\nTracey directory.\n\f19818     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\npoint out the relevant files. Dissent at 19839. The dissent\nexplains that this approach would have allowed the govern-\nment to select the relevant files on-site: “Dr. Jean Joseph of\nCDT later stated in an affidavit that the directory was easily\nsearched by key word and would have provided the test infor-\nmation about the ten players in a short period of time.” Id.\n\n   [16] The government had no duty to rely on CDT to illumi-\nnate the files seizable under the warrant. Like most searched\nparties, CDT had an incentive to avoid giving over documents\nthe government might not know to miss. The government had\nno reason to confine its search to “key words” such as the\nnames of the baseball players. Such a limited search could\neasily have overlooked relevant documents, as it would have\nin the case of the seizures at Quest. There, testing results were\nnot saved by key word at all. They were labeled with identifi-\ncation numbers, whose connection to specific players could\nnot be found within the document or at the facility, but were\nlinked in a document kept in a storage locker located at a dif-\nferent address. See supra Section I.B, notes 13-14 and accom-\npanying text.\n\n   [17] The government was not required to believe, and had\nno reason to assume, that all relevant documents in the Tracey\nDirectory would be listed under the names of the baseball\nplayers in the warrant. The government’s decision to copy the\nentire directory represented a conscientious effort to seek out\nall the evidence covered by the search warrant. We do not dis-\ncern bad faith or “callous disregard” simply because the\nagents determined, after an initial review, that certain inter-\nmingled files needed to be reviewed off site, as permitted\nunder our applicable precedents and the warrant itself.39\n  39\n    We do not reach the government’s argument that the “plain view”\nexception to the warrant requirement justified seizure of the intermingled\nevidence, because the evidence fell within the scope of the search warrant.\nSee Beusch, 596 F.2d 871 (“Because we hold that the items seized were\ncovered by the terms of the warrant, we find it unnecessary to deal with\nthe Government’s contentions that they were admissible under the ‘plain\nview’ exception to the warrant requirement.”).\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19819\n                               5\n\n   [18] In light of these considerations, we conclude that the\ngovernment properly considered and respected the privacy\ninterests, intrusiveness, and law enforcement needs posed by\nthe searches in question by removing a copy of the Tracey\ndirectory (not the original) and taking only limited diskettes\nand documents containing relevant information. In seizing\nthese files, the government did not show “callous disregard\nfor the constitutional rights of the movant,” Ramsden, 2 F.3d\nat 325, but instead displayed attentiveness both to the war-\nrant’s precautionary procedures and to the importance of\navoiding unnecessary disruption of CDT’s business opera-\ntions. For these reasons, we conclude that the first prong of\nthe Ramsden analysis (the existence of “callous disregard”)\nweighs against invocation of the district court’s equitable\njurisdiction over the Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) motions. The dis-\ntrict courts’ conclusions to the contrary were based on faulty\nconclusions of law and unsupported assertions of fact. They\ncannot survive appellate review.\n\n                               B\n\n   As to the second of the four Ramsden factors (the movants’\nindividual interests in the evidence seized), the Players’ Asso-\nciation argues that its interests in the property mirror those of\nits members. We agree that the members possess strong pri-\nvacy interests in both their drug test results and the actual\nspecimens. See Roe v. Sherry, 91 F.3d 1270, 1274 (9th Cir.\n1996) (recognizing an individual’s “strong interest in protect-\ning the confidentiality of [one’s] HIV status”). Because the\nPlayers’ Association exists to represent such interests, the dis-\ntrict courts properly found that this factor weighed in favor of\nequitable jurisdiction.\n\n                               C\n\n   The district courts also found satisfied the third Ramsden\nfactor (likelihood of irreparable injury if the evidence were\n\f19820   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nnot returned). As the Players’ Association notes, the public\nrelease of positive drug testing evidence could irreparably\ndamage the careers of the affected players, even if the positive\nresults were not actually caused by illegal steroid use. Based\non this danger, we agree that the third factor also weighs in\nfavor of equitable jurisdiction.\n\n                               D\n\n   [19] Although we conclude that the district courts erred in\nfinding callous disregard of Fourth Amendment rights, the\nthree other equitable jurisdiction factors weigh in favor of\nhearing the motions by the Players’ Association and CDT. See\nRamsden, 2 F.3d at 326 (holding that three factors justified\nexercise of equitable jurisdiction to hear Fed. R. Crim. P.\n41(g) motion). As such, we cannot say that either district\ncourt’s initial choice to hear the motion constituted an abuse\nof discretion.\n\n                              IV\n\n  We turn now to the merits of the substantive rulings issued\nby Judge Cooper and Judge Mahan that ordered return of all\nproperty other than evidence directly related to the ten players\nnamed in the search warrants.\n\n                               A\n\n  With respect to property taken during search warrants, Fed.\nR. Crim. P. 41(g) provides that a person who is deprived of\nproperty may move for its return. When such a motion is\ngranted, the property in question must be returned to the mov-\ning party, but a court “may impose reasonable conditions to\nprotect access to the property and its use in later proceed-\nings.” Id. Although the rule itself does not set a standard for\ndetermining when property should be returned to a moving\nparty, an advisory committee note explains that “reasonable-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19821\nness under all of the circumstances must be the test.” Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 41 advisory committee’s note.\n\n   [20] We have repeatedly held that a Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g)\nmotion is properly denied if “the government’s need for the\nproperty as evidence continues.” United States v. Fitzen, 80\nF.3d 387, 388 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted); United States v. Mills, 991 F.2d 609, 612 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(same). The advisory committee note explains: “If the United\nStates has a need for the property in an investigation or prose-\ncution, its retention of the property generally is reasonable.”\nFed. R. Crim. P. 41 advisory committee’s note.\n\n   [21] It is when the government no longer needs the prop-\nerty as evidence that a presumption arises, giving the owner\na right to have the property returned. Fitzen, 80 F.3d at 388.\nHere, the government already has provided copies of all docu-\nments seized, and it states that the remaining evidence is\nessential to its investigation and prosecution of the distribu-\ntion of illegal steroids. This legitimate law enforcement pur-\npose makes return of the intermingled evidence improper, as\nthe files were seized legally under the search warrant and our\nprecedent.\n\n   Moreover, even in cases where agents seized too much evi-\ndence, we have noted that return of property should follow\nonly a particularly egregious violation: “The issue is whether\nthe Government’s conduct was sufficiently reprehensible in\nthis case to warrant this sanction.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 327.\nIn Ramsden, we refused to impose this extreme sanction on\npolice who had time to obtain a warrant but made no effort\nto do so and “simply chose not to comply with [their] obliga-\ntions under the Fourth Amendment.” Id. at 325, 327.\n\n   [22] Our governing precedent offers no support for a full\nreturn of the intermingled evidence. Indeed, both the Beusch\nand Tamura courts underscored the need for effective crimi-\nnal law enforcement. Thus, the Beusch court resolved: “As\n\f19822     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nlong as an item appears, at the time of the search, to contain\nevidence reasonably related to the purposes of the search,\nthere is no reason—absent some other Fourth Amendment\nviolation—to suppress it.” 596 F.2d at 877. Even the Tamura\ncourt—which determined that the agents unambiguously\nflouted the limits of the search warrant—concluded: “[W]e\ncannot say, although we find it a close case, that the officers\nso abused the warrant’s authority that the otherwise valid war-\nrant was transformed into a general one, thereby requiring all\nfruits to be suppressed.” Tamura, 694 F.2d at 597.\n\n   In Tamura, the government did not seek to use evidence at\ntrial that fell outside the scope of the warrant. Therefore, the\ncourt found return of the seized property inappropriate, even\nthough some evidence had been unlawfully taken. In the cases\nbefore us today, the government has made clear that it desires\nto use only information related to the ten named Balco players\nand to other players who tested positive—and who therefore\nmay have become targets of an expanded grand jury\ninvestigation—as a result of intermingled information we\nhave determined was seized lawfully under the warrant.\nWhile we agree that some information still retained by the\ngovernment, at least in duplicate, may fall outside the scope\nof the warrant, we do not believe a return of the lawfully\nseized intermingled evidence properly remedies that wrong.40\n\n   [23] Thus, the district courts erred in granting the Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 41(g) motions and ordering the government to return\nall evidence seized from CDT and Quest—and all related\nnotes by agents who reviewed the evidence—that did not\nrelate to the ten Balco players expressly named in the search\nwarrants.\n  40\n    The orders of the two district courts would require the return of all\nevidence other than that related to the ten named players. We have\ndescribed in detail why this view misinterprets Tamura in a way that\nwould invalidate lawful and reasonable searches and seizures. It would\nalso hamper the public interest in full and comprehensive investigations as\nleads unfold in the course of the grand jury’s inquiries.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19823\n                                     B\n\n   [24] We are persuaded that the government’s seizure of\nintermingled evidence for off-site review was lawful and rea-\nsonable, and we view the two orders requiring return of all\nproperty related to players not specifically named as both\nunjustified and improper. However, the government has yet to\ncomply with its duty of adequate off-site review. Tamura\noffered a suggested procedure for review by a neutral magis-\ntrate, and we conclude that such review is necessary to ensure\nthat the seizure of intermingled computer records remains rea-\nsonable.\n\n   The Tamura court urged that off-site review be conducted\nby a magistrate, in order to avoid giving the task to a party\nwith an interest in retaining too much.41 We cannot accept the\ngovernment’s argument that it may retain all evidence simply\nbecause it assured the Players’ Association and CDT (without\nsigns of bad faith) that it did not intend to use all the files. In\nthe case of a lawful and reasonable seizure of intermingled\ncomputer records for off-site review, as at bar, our precedents\nand the general reasonableness mandate of the Fourth Amend-\nment require the supervision of a magistrate. It is not reason-\nable to allow the government to seize an indeterminately\nbounded array of computer data only later to set its own stan-\ndards for review and retention thereof.42\n  41\n      It is not necessary that a magistrate always give advance authorization\nfor seizures of intermingled evidence. Here, as in United States v. Hay,\n231 F.3d 630 (9th Cir. 2000), we do not read Tamura to require prior\nauthorization for off-site review. See id. at 637 (finding Tamura “inappo-\nsite . . . for its suggestion that magistrate judges should approve seizure\nof materials beyond those described in the warrant before wholesale\nremoval occurs” (emphasis added)). However, we still read Tamura to\napply in a significant way in the context of lawful seizures of intermingled\ncomputer data.\n   42\n      We do not belabor the government’s alleged failure to follow its own\ninternal guidelines. The dissent takes note that the U.S. Attorney’s manual\nstates “that a search warrant should normally not be used to obtain confi-\n\f19824     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n  It is true that Tamura proposed a pragmatic approach, and\nnot a constitutional rule. We recognize that some courts in\nother circuits have questioned the procedures advised in\nTamura. One district court in Michigan explained: “The Court\ndeclines to follow Tamura, at least in this case, because\nTamura did not involve computer files and therefore did not\nconsider the specific problems associated with conducting a\nsearch for computerized records.” Scott-Emuakpor, 2000 WL\n288443, at *8. Although declining to apply Tamura’s prag-\nmatic approach to computer searches, Judge Quist stated:\n“This is not to suggest that seizure of all computer disks is\npermissible whenever the warrant authorizes the seizure of\ncomputer records.” Id. Another court, also referencing\nTamura, noted that in the modern computer context a “ ‘sug-\ngestion’ by a panel of the Ninth Circuit in a 20-plus year old\ncase is not persuasive.” United States v. Kaufman, 2005 WL\n2304345, at *4 n.3 (D. Kan).\n\n   Like these district courts from other circuits, we recognize\nthat the computer era adds new complexity to the test of rea-\nsonableness under the Fourth Amendment. Precisely for this\nreason, we view Tamura as especially important in the com-\nputer context. Although indeed writing over two decades ago,\nthe Tamura court appreciated the same dual—and sometimes\nconflicting—interests of minimizing the intrusiveness of\nsearches and containing the breadth of seizures. The Tamura\ncourt stated that “large-scale removal of material” can be jus-\ntified “where on-site sorting is infeasible and no other practi-\ncal alternative exists,” Tamura, 694 F.2d at 596, but also\n\ndential materials such as treatment records,” and that the Department of\nJustice’s guidelines disfavor use of a search warrant where a subpoena\nwould suffice. See Dissent at 19866. The existence of those guidelines is\nnot disputed. Yet, quite simply, the government’s guidelines do not dictate\nwhat is “reasonable” under the Fourth Amendment. If its guidelines did\nso, the government would have every reason to enact permissive internal\nrules. We have no reason or authority to give the government that perverse\nincentive.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 19825\nadvised that a magistrate should oversee the off-site review of\ndocuments. We conclude that upon a proper post-seizure\nmotion by the aggrieved parties, the record should be sealed\nand reviewed by a magistrate—such as the one who originally\nissued the warrant.43 This procedure affords the necessary pro-\ntection against unreasonable retention of property after a sei-\nzure of intermingled computer data.\n\n   Insofar as the dissent emphasizes the crucial need to set\nparameters on government seizures and retention of intermin-\ngled computer evidence, we agree. On the other hand, the dis-\nsent attempts to limit computer searches and seizures to an\nunreasonable degree—one neither warranted by the Constitu-\ntion nor by our precedent. The dissent would affirm the dis-\ntrict courts’ Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) orders in toto, relying upon\nTamura yet failing to recognize the continued relevance of\nBeusch. This extreme approach, which would forbid the sei-\nzure of intermingled data, would compel law enforcement\nagents, when unexpectedly confronted with intermingled\ncomputer data, to give up the search and leave. They could\nonly return to the scene if equipped with a new warrant autho-\nrizing removal of the specific intermingled evidence, repeat-\ning this procedure until all relevant intermingled evidence\nwere obtained. After many such warrants and intrusions, the\nintermingled evidence might well no longer be intact. More-\nover, rather than limit the intrusiveness of a search and sei-\n   43\n      The dissent mistakenly concludes that this procedure allows the gov-\nernment to establish “what the Fourth Amendment required it to do in the\nfirst : instance: [that] probable cause exists to seize and search the proper-\nty.” Dissent at 19894. The point of the Tamura procedure is to ensure that\nintermingled documents, legitimately seized for off-site review under a\nwarrant supported by probable cause, do not contain documents that turn\nout, upon scrutiny, to be easily separable. In a seizure of a plethora of doc-\numents containing relevant material interspersed with irrelevant docu-\nments, it is predictable that some documents, although legitimately seized\nfor off-site review, turn out to be separable without changing the nature\nof the relevant documents. The purpose of the Tamura procedure is to\nmonitor the off-site separation process, not to establish probable cause.\n\f19826     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nzure of intermingled computer data by allowing the\ngovernment to remove the whole for off-site review, the dis-\nsent’s approach would magnify unnecessarily the burdens\nimposed by computer search warrants, both on the govern-\nment and on the parties searched, with no corresponding ben-\nefit in light of the constitutional linchpin of reasonableness in\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\n   [25] We conclude that, while the government may seize\nintermingled data for off-site review to minimize intrusive-\nness of a computer search, it may not retain or use the evi-\ndence after proper objections are raised, unless a magistrate\nsubsequently reviews and filters the evidence off-site.44 The\nmagistrate must adhere to our precedent in a balanced man-\nner. In her review, the magistrate should apply our precedent,\nincluding Beusch, which permits the seizure of single ledgers\nor files with intermingled data. In the context of computer\nfiles, we believe that most seized materials can be pared down\nconsiderably, but that certain files—spreadsheets of only a\nfew pages, for example—may be retained in whole.45\n\n  After the magistrate determines which sealed items fall\nwithin the search warrant, the government may retain and use\n  44\n      We note that the government has little to lose by following this pre-\ncaution. A magistrate will allocate to the government whatever property\nit may legitimately retain under the warrant. Yet if agents rely on their\nown judgment, they may err on the side of retaining items outside the\nsearch warrant or err on the side of returning evidence our precedents\nwould permit them to retain.\n   45\n      In this analysis, the magistrate may consider relevant, among other\nfactors: 1) whether evidence mentioned in the search warrant can be sepa-\nrated from unrelated evidence by copying or moving files, but without cre-\nating new documents, 2) whether the file, if printed, would fill more than\na typical paper ledger (of the sort in Beusch), 3) whether excision of the\nunrelated portions of the document would distort the character of the origi-\nnal document. This list is neither exhaustive nor mandatory, but offers rel-\nevant considerations for a magistrate to determine what evidence the\ngovernment can reasonably retain after a lawful seizure of intermingled\ndigital data.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19827\nsuch items; all others must be returned to the person or entity\nsearched.46 The government is always free to seek judicial\nauthorization, either through subsequent search warrants or\ndistrict court authorization on review of the magistrate’s rul-\nings, to justify expansion of the investigation upon proper\nshowing of any item’s relevancy to suspected criminal behav-\nior uncovered during review of the evidence initially seized.\n\n   [26] In this case, we conclude that the proper remedy is to\nremand these Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) matters to the appropriate\ndistrict courts, for the purpose of sealing the materials seized\nunder the search warrants and transferring them to a magis-\ntrate for expeditious review and isolation of the files that the\ngovernment may legally retain.\n\n                                     V\n\n   Finally, we consider the government’s appeal of Judge Ills-\nton’s order quashing the May 6 subpoenas, which sought drug\ntesting records and specimens for all MLB players who tested\npositive for steroids.47\n\n   [27] Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(2), a “court may quash\n. . . [a] subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or\noppressive.” The district court found that the May 2004 sub-\npoenas constituted harassment and were unreasonable.48\n  46\n      This approach does not permit the government to seize computer files\n“wholesale,” without any effort to limit the documents seized. Nothing we\nsuggest lifts the Fourth Amendment’s bar on “unreasonable searches and\nseizures.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. Like the Beusch and Tamura courts, we\npoint out the parameters of a reasonable search and seizure in the complex\ncontext of intermingled files. Case-by-case evaluation remains essential,\nbecause our Founding Fathers chose a general prohibition on unreasonable\nsearches; they did not create a rigid rule that could at times prove too per-\nmissive and at times prove too strict.\n   47\n      We review a district court’s decision to quash a grand jury subpoena\nfor abuse of discretion. In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 803 F.2d at 496.\n   48\n      The district court did not find that the subpoenas were oppressive.\n\f19828   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   To support its finding, the district court pointed to United\nStates v. American Honda Motor Co., 273 F. Supp. 810 (N.D.\nIll. 1967). In American Honda, the government issued sub-\npoenas that were “substantially identical” to one another but\nin different locations. Id. at 819. As a result, Honda was faced\nwith producing the same documents repeatedly, and the court\nfound this to be harassment. Id. at 819-20. American Honda,\nhowever, does not preclude the government from pursuing the\nsame information through the contemporaneous issuance of\nsubpoenas and applications for search warrants.\n\n   We addressed the issuance of contemporaneous search war-\nrants and subpoenas in In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated\nDecember 10, 1987, 926 F.2d at 854. There we upheld the\nvalidity of the subpoenas against the challenge that “the sub-\npoenas were served at the same time as the search warrants\nand the federal agents attempted to ‘enforce’ the subpoenas\nthrough immediate seizure of the documents.” Id. at 854. Not-\ning that the challenge to the subpoenas received no support in\nprecedent, we clarified the differences between subpoenas and\nsearch warrants:\n\n    Subpoenas are not search warrants. They involve dif-\n    ferent levels of intrusion on a person’s privacy. A\n    search warrant allows the officer to enter the per-\n    son’s premises, and to examine for himself the per-\n    son’s belongings. The officer, pursuant to the\n    warrant, determines what is seized.\n\nId. By comparison:\n\n    Service of a forthwith subpoena does not authorize\n    an entry into a private residence. Furthermore, the\n    person served determines whether he will surrender\n    the items identified in the subpoena or challenge the\n    validity of the subpoena prior to compliance.\n\nId. We concluded that “[t]hese differences are not eliminated\nby the fact that the search warrants and subpoenas were deliv-\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19829\nered at the same time” and observed that the complaining\nparty had “failed to show that the papers that are described in\nthe subpoenas are outside the scope of a legitimate investiga-\ntion by the grand jury.” Id. at 854-55. In addition, we specifi-\ncally emphasized the fact that the defendant was given almost\na month to comply with the subpoenas. Id. at 854.\n\n   [28] Therefore, the district court erred in finding the issu-\nance of subpoenas and the contemporaneous execution of\nsearch warrants to be unreasonable. The Players’ Association\nhas not argued that the evidence sought by the subpoenas is\n“outside the scope of a legitimate investigation by the grand\njury.” Id. at 855. The subpoenas were not returnable on the\nsame day that the search warrants were executed. As in In re\nGrand Jury Subpoenas, the return dates on the subpoenas\nwere over a month from the date on which the warrants were\nexecuted. The district court declared the May 6 subpoenas an\n“unreasonable insurance” policy, but it failed to recognize the\ndifferent purposes and requirements of the warrant as com-\npared to the subpoena and the legitimate concern that produc-\ntion of relevant evidence to the grand jury would be unduly\ndelayed. See id. at 854. It was error to conflate the two dis-\ntinct tools. Insurance it may have been; but, under the Fourth\nAmendment, unreasonable it was not.\n\n   The district court also deemed the government’s actions\nunreasonable because it found that the agents sought search\nwarrants in three separate districts in an attempt to avoid a\nruling on the motion to quash the existing subpoenas of Janu-\nary and March 2004. We note that granting the motion to\nquash would not have prevented the government from seeking\nthe search warrants, particularly given the existence of proba-\nble cause. As the Fourth Circuit has noted, “the fact that a\ngrand jury subpoena existed . . . at the time of the search obvi-\nously had no effect upon whether probable cause existed to\nsearch . . . for documents which were properly included\nwithin the warrant’s scope.” United States v. Photogrammet-\nric Data Servs., Inc., 259 F.3d 229, 238 (4th Cir. 2001), over-\n\f19830      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nruled on other grounds by Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S.\n36 (2004).\n\n   [29] As such, the district court rested its order on legally\ninsufficient grounds, and abused its discretion in granting the\nmotion to quash. See United States v. Iverson, 162 F.3d 1015,\n1026 (9th Cir. 1998).\n\n                                  VI\n\n   Finally, we address the Non-Party Journalist’s Motion To\nUnseal, filed on November 23, 2005 by Joshua A. Gerstein.\nGerstein seeks access to “the dockets for these appeals and the\ncases below, the district court opinions and/or orders that are\nthe subject of these appeals, and all briefs filed with this Court.”49\nWe have jurisdiction over these documents, because the dis-\ntrict courts’ records transferred to us upon appeal. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 11.\n\n  Although not a party, Gerstein enjoys standing to file the\nmotion based upon his constitutional interest in the proceed-\nings:\n\n       Under the first amendment, the press and the public\n       have a presumed right of access to court proceedings\n       and documents. . . . This presumed right can be over-\n       come only by an overriding right or interest “based\n       on findings that closure is essential to preserve\n       higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that\n       interest.”\n  49\n     Oral proceedings before this court on November 15, 2005, were open\nto the public. On November 9, 2005, CDT and MLB filed an unopposed\nMotion To Seal Courtroom During Oral Argument. We denied the motion\nthe next day. On November 14, 2005, CDT and MLB filed a Motion for\nReconsideration of Motion To Seal Courtroom During Oral Argument,\nwhich the government joined. We denied the motion the same day.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 19831\nOregonian Publ’g Co. v. District Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 1465\n(9th Cir. 1990) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior\nCourt, 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1985)).50 The Supreme Court has\nnoted the particular interest of media members in “publish[-\ning] information concerning the operation of government.”\nNixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978).\n\n   To decide whether Gerstein’s interest justifies unsealing\nportions of the records, the court also must consider the pri-\nvacy interests of the litigants, for “the right to inspect and\ncopy judicial records is not absolute.” Id. In the appeals at bar,\nthe records contain extremely sensitive information, espe-\ncially the drug-testing records. If revealed, this information\ncould adversely affect the reputations of many competitive\nbaseball players. Therefore, the motion to unseal requires a\ncareful balancing of the interests at stake. See id. (noting that\naccess to judicial records may be limited to protect the pri-\nvacy interests of the litigants, such as to avoid disclosure of\n“sources of business information that might harm a litigant’s\ncompetitive standing”).\n\n   Although we have jurisdiction to conduct a merits analysis\nof the motion to unseal, the district courts—having greater\nfamiliarity with the records51 —are in a better position to bal-\nance the privacy interests and to determine which materials\nare protected grand jury materials. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).\n  50\n     Gerstein premises his motion on Ninth Circuit Rule 27-13(c). That\nrule states: “During the pendency of an appeal, any party may file a\nmotion with this court requesting that matters filed under seal either in the\ndistrict court or in this court be unsealed. Any motion shall be served on\nall parties.” Id. (emphasis added). Although Joshua Gerstein is not a\n“party” under this rule, his standing derives from his constitutional interest\nand does not depend upon the applicability of Ninth Circuit Rule 27-13(c).\n  51\n    Sensitive portions of the records were neither revealed nor discussed\nat oral argument before this court. See supra note 49.\n\f19832     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nTherefore, we refer the Gerstein motion to the district courts\nfor consideration upon remand.52\n\n                                   VII\n\n   We now summarize the resolution of these consolidated\nappeals. We conclude that the government’s seizures were\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and that the district\ncourts erred in ruling that Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) required\nreturn of all property and agent review notes unrelated to the\nten expressly named Balco players.\n\n   At the same time, we recognize limits to the government’s\nright to retain evidence seized, even where a broad seizure is\nreasonable in order to avoid lengthy and intrusive on-site\ninspection. Our Fourth Amendment precedents explain that\nthe government may retain single “ledgers” of intermingled\nevidence, but may not keep separate, unrelated evidence. A\nmagistrate is in the best position to sort through the actual evi-\ndence and to determine those files that may be kept when\naggrieved parties seek relief. Readily separable evidence\nunrelated to persons named in the search warrants must be\nreturned. The Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) cases must be remanded\nto the District of Nevada and Central District of California to\npermit such review of the sealed documents by magistrates.\n\n   With regard to the May 6 subpoenas, which covered the\nsame evidence as the contemporaneous search warrants, we\nconclude the order of the Northern District of California\nquashing the subpoenas was an abuse of discretion. The\nrecord, illuminated by caselaw, reveals that the subpoenas\nwere not unreasonable and did not constitute harassment.\n  52\n    In the Central District of California and District of Nevada, the motion\ncan be addressed during the remand pursuant to this opinion. See infra\nSection VII. The motion will need to be separately decided in the Northern\nDistrict of California.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19833\n   [30] Therefore, the orders of the Central District of Califor-\nnia, the District of Nevada, and the Northern District of Cali-\nfornia cannot stand. The three cases consolidated in this\nappeal are hereby\n\n  REVERSED in part and REMANDED in part.\n\n\n\nTHOMAS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   One of the three extremely able district court judges who\nrejected the government’s argument summarized it best, stat-\ning: “What happened to the Fourth Amendment? Was it\nrepealed somehow?”\n\n   Although it only had a search warrant for data concerning\neleven Major League Baseball players, the government seized\nthousands of medical records and test results involving every\nsingle Major League Baseball player. The government did not\nstop there, seizing thousands of other medical records for\nindividuals in thirteen other major sports organizations, three\nunaffiliated business entities, and three sports competitions.\nThe government now seeks to retain all of the medical infor-\nmation it obtained about persons who were not the subject of\nany criminal inquiry.\n\n   The stakes in this case are high. The government claims the\nright to search—without warrant or even a suspicion of crimi-\nnal activity—any patient’s confidential medical record con-\ntained in a computer directory so long as it has a legitimate\nwarrant or subpoena for any other individual patient’s record\nthat may be contained as part of data stored on the same com-\nputer. The government attempts to justify this novel theory on\na breathtaking expansion of the “plain view” doctrine, which\nclearly has no application to intermingled private electronic\ndata.\n\f19834   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   As radical as the government’s position is, the majority\ngoes even further. It holds that the government—without war-\nrant or even a suspicion of criminal activity—may seize,\nretain, and view all confidential records in any electronic\ndatabase on which private data responsive to a warrant\nresides. Under the majority’s holding, a magistrate would be\nrequired to review the seized data for probable cause after sei-\nzure only if an aggrieved party made a motion. Even then, if\nthe magistrate concluded that the irrelevant data was “co-\nmingled,” the government would be entitled to retain the con-\nfidential medical records. This new theory was not argued by\nany party, nor presented to any district judge at any time dur-\ning the course of these protracted and hotly contested pro-\nceedings.\n\n   The scope of the majority’s new holding in the digital age\ncould not be greater; it removes confidential electronic\nrecords from the protections of the Fourth Amendment. The\nholding also squarely conflicts with the sound and sensible\nprocedural protections detailed in United States v. Tamura,\n694 F.2d 591 (1982), which direct the government to seal and\nhold documents containing intermingled data pending\napproval of a magistrate of a further search.\n\n   I agree with the careful findings and conclusions of the\nthree district judges who rejected the government’s position.\nFor that reason, and because of the profound consequences of\nthe majority’s opinion on the privacy of medical records\nthroughout the United States, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                               I\n\n   The investigation in this case ostensibly involved Bay Area\nLab Co-Operative, popularly referenced as “Balco.” The gov-\nernment suspected Balco of distributing illegal steroids to cer-\ntain athletes, including some Major League Baseball players.\nThe government knew that, pursuant to a collective bargain-\ning agreement between the Major League Players Association\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19835\n(“Players Association” or “MLBPA”) and Major League\nBaseball, confidential testing had been analyzed by Compre-\nhensive Drug Testing, Inc. (“CDT”), and other laboratories,\nfor the sole purpose of determining whether Major League\nBaseball should adopt an individualized steroid testing pro-\ngram.\n\n   Through the collective bargaining agreement, the players\nwere assured that the testing would be anonymous and confi-\ndential, and that the samples and individual data would be\ndestroyed upon tabulation of the results. The only object of\nthe exercise was to determine the approximate magnitude of\napparent steroid use with the goal of fashioning appropriate\npolicies to address it. The collective bargaining agreement\nacknowledged and anticipated that the tests for some players\nmight well yield positive results due to the ingestion of legal\nand proper over-the-counter supplements.\n\n   Although information developed by the government in its\ncriminal investigation pointed only to specific individuals\nwho might be involved with Balco, the government served a\ngrand jury subpoena on CDT on January 16, 2004, seeking\ndrug tests for all major league baseball players. After receiv-\ning the subpoena, the Players Association and CDT contacted\nthe United States Attorneys’ Office to discuss their concerns\nwith the breadth of the subpoena. At the government’s\nrequest, the Players Association, CDT, and Major League\nBaseball prepared and presented a “white paper” to the gov-\nernment detailing the provisions of the collective bargaining\nagreement pertaining to testing, with emphasis on the many\nconfidentiality provisions, and raising concerns about the\ninvasion of the constitutionally-protected privacy interests of\nthe players who were not involved in the Balco investigation.\n\n   The Players Association and CDT assured the government\nin writing that CDT would maintain all of the subpoenaed\nrecords until the disputes were resolved by negotiation or liti-\ngation. On February 4, 2003, the Chief of the Criminal Divi-\n\f19836    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nsion wrote the counsel for CDT indicating that the\ngovernment had accepted the assurances by CDT that none of\nthe materials sought by the subpoena would be destroyed or\naltered pending the government’s reconsideration of the sub-\npoena and a motion to quash the subpoena, if filed.\n\n   On February 12, 2004, the grand jury returned a 42-count\nindictment against Victor Conte, Jr. (Balco’s founder), James\nJ. Valente (Balco’s Vice President), Greg F. Anderson (a\ntrainer), and Remi Korchemny (a track coach). The charges\nagainst the defendants included conspiracy to possess with\nintent to distribute anabolic steroids, possession with intent to\ndistribute anabolic steroids, introduction and delivery of mis-\nbranded drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud,\nand misbranding of drugs held for sale with intent to defraud.\n\n   On March 3, the government served a second grand jury\nsubpoena on CDT, seeking information on only eleven named\nbaseball players. However, it did not withdraw the January 16\nsubpoena. On April 7, with no compromise reached and with\na return date passed, the Players Association filed a motion in\nthe Northern District of California in San Francisco to quash\nthe CDT subpoena. The motion was assigned to Judge Jeffery\nS. White.\n\n   After learning that a motion to quash would be filed but\nbefore the motion could be heard, the government applied for\na search warrant to search the CDT offices for the same infor-\nmation it was seeking in the grand jury subpoena. The search\nwarrant application was made some 240 miles away in\nanother federal judicial district, without notice to the Players\nAssociation or to the district court in the Northern District of\nCalifornia.\n\n  In the search warrant proceedings in the Central District of\nCalifornia, the government never brought to the magistrate\njudge’s attention that there was a motion pending before\nJudge White in the Northern District of California to quash\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19837\nthe grand jury subpoena. The affidavit did not disclose that\nthe Players Association had joined the motion. Rather, the\naffidavit stated:\n\n      The referenced grand jury subpoena, for the items\n      listed in Attachment B, was issued; however, while\n      not denying that they have the requested materials,\n      CDT has declined to comply with the subpoena and\n      has stated its intent to attempt to quash the subpoena.1\n\n   The affidavit did not disclose that CDT had agreed in writ-\ning to keep the data and other materials secured until the\nscope of the grand jury subpoena was settled, either through\nnegotiation or a ruling on a motion to quash. Rather, the affi-\ndavit justified removing computer data and equipment from\nthe searched premises on the basis that the computer data\ncould be concealed, altered, or destroyed by the user.\n\n   The affidavit also informed the magistrate judge that\n“[c]omputer hardware and storage devices may contain\n‘booby traps’ that destroy or alter data if certain procedures\nare not scrupulously followed.” It noted that computer data\nwas “particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nmodification or destruction.”\n\n   The government did not have any evidence or reason to\nbelieve that CDT had engaged in steganography, booby-\ntrapping computers, or any type of data destruction or alter-\n  1\n    Some months later, Judge Illston asked the government: “Did you\nexplain to Judge Johnson what was happening before Judge White, even\non the day that you got him to issue the warrant?” Government counsel\nreplied, “We did inform Judge Johnson of the existence of the grand jury\nsubpoena and it’s in the warrant application of Judge Johnson that defense\nhad indicated that it wanted to move to quash the subpoena. So we did\nindicate to Judge Johnson there was a disputed grand jury issue. Yes, it\nwas disclosed to Judge Johnson.” Neither the warrant application nor the\naffidavit filed in support of the application contain any reference to pend-\ning proceedings before Judge White.\n\f19838    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nation. To the contrary, it had accepted in writing CDT’s assur-\nances “that CDT will maintain and preserve all materials\ncalled for by the first subpoena as well as any materials called\nfor by the new subpoena” and that “CDT would not destroy\nor alter any of the materials called for by either of the subpoe-\nnas.” However, the plain import of the application was that\nCDT was improperly resisting compliance with a valid grand\njury subpoena and data was in jeopardy of being destroyed.\n\n   Based on the government’s application, a search warrant\nwas issued by Magistrate Judge Jeffery W. Johnson in the\nCentral District of California in Los Angeles. The warrant\nauthorized the seizure of records regarding drug specimens,\ntesting, and test results of only ten specifically named Major\nLeague baseball players. The warrant also provided that if the\ncomputer data seized did not fall within any of the items to\nbe seized or is not otherwise legally seized, the government\nwould return the data. The affidavit provided by Special\nAgent Novitzky in support of the issuance of the warrants\nstated that obtaining information to link the test results to\nindividual players was necessary “to ensure that samples of\nindividuals not associated with Balco are left undisturbed.”\n\n   The warrant was issued one day after the motion to quash\nthe grand jury subpoena had been filed in the Northern Dis-\ntrict of California. Upon arrival at the premises of CDT on the\nmorning of the search, Special Agent Novitzky and other\nagents discussed with CDT’s attorney the need to search\nCDT’s computers.\n\n   The information sought in the search warrant was contained\nin three places: a segregated list only containing information\nabout the ten athletes that were subject of the search warrant;\na master list of the drug test results for all Major League\nBaseball players; and a computer directory (often referred to\nas the “Tracey directory”) that contained information and\nmedical test results for hundreds of other baseball players and\nathletes engaged in professional sports. Counsel for CDT\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING              19839\nrequested that all material pertaining to the specific items\nlisted in the warrant be reviewed and redacted by a magistrate\njudge or special master before it was seen by the government.\nThe government refused the request.2 The government also\nrejected CDT’s offer to provide the records it had already seg-\nregated concerning the small subset of players at issue.\n\n   In addition to the segregated materials, the government\nseized the master list, the entire Tracey Directory (which con-\nsisted of more than 2,900 files), lists of teams and players and\ndrug testing details, and eleven diskettes, all of which con-\ntained drug-test results on hundreds of Major League Baseball\nplayers and other athletes. The agents searching the Tracey\ndirectory at the scene concluded that certain of the subdirecto-\nries appeared to contain information not called for by the war-\nrant. Rather than copying only the subdirectories that\npertained to Major League Baseball, the agents copied the\nentire directory. In fact, the directory contained 2,911 files\nthat had nothing to do with Major League Baseball drug test-\ning, but rather contained test results for numerous other sports\nentities and business organizations. Dr. Jean Joseph of CDT\nlater stated in an affidavit that the directory was easily\nsearched by key word and would have provided the test infor-\nmation about the ten players in a short period of time.\n\n   Judge Cooper later specifically found that “[o]nce the items\nwere seized the requirement of the search warrant that any\nseized items not covered by the warrant be first screened and\nsegregated by computer personnel was completely ignored.”\nShe further found that Agent Novitzky himself reviewed the\nseized computer data and used what he learned to obtain the\nsubsequent search warrants issued in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, the Central District of California, and Nevada.\n  2\n    Department of Justice Guidelines provide that, in cases involving con-\nfidential patient information, a search warrant “shall be executed in such\na manner as to minimize, to the greatest extent practicable, scrutiny of\nconfidential materials.” 28 C.F.R. § 59.4(b)(4).\n\f19840   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n  After the initial search, and based on the search results, the\ngovernment sought and obtained that day a second search\nwarrant from Magistrate Judge Johnson for a search of a stor-\nage facility maintained by CDT.\n\n   On the same day, the government also applied for a search\nwarrant in the District of Nevada. The warrant sought infor-\nmation in the business files of Quest Diagnostics, Inc., a labo-\nratory that had also been involved in the administration of\nMajor League Baseball’s drug testing program in 2003. The\nwarrant was limited to information concerning the ten base-\nball players identified in the Los Angles search warrant. The\naffidavit filed in support of the warrant did not disclose the\nhistory of the issuance of the grand jury subpoena or the filing\nof a motion to quash the subpoena. Based on the information\nprovided by the government, Magistrate Judge Lawrence\nLeavitt issued the warrant, and the warrant was executed.\n\n   On April 9, 2004, the Players Association arranged an\nemergency hearing before Judge White, before whom the\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena was pending. The\nPlayers Association sought an order restricting the govern-\nment from disseminating any information it had obtained until\nthe Players Association had an opportunity to litigate the\nmotion to quash or a Rule 41 motion to return the seized prop-\nerty. The government argued that Judge White had no juris-\ndiction over the items seized pursuant to the search warrants,\neven though the grand jury subpoena sought the same materi-\nals.\n\n   The government represented to the court that it would not\ndisseminate the information and would negotiate in good faith\nabout the seized items. Judge White accepted that representa-\ntion. He noted that he did not have jurisdiction over the items\nseized pursuant to the warrants, but that the motions to quash\nthe grand jury subpoenas remained pending before him. Judge\nWhite acknowledged that the position of the Players Associa-\ntion was “well taken with respect to the U.S. Attorney’s man-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19841\nual and the government allegedly not following proper\nprocedure,” but that the Players Association had other avail-\nable remedies to resolve that issue on the merits.\n\n   On April 22, 2004, the government wrote CDT indicating\nthat it was withdrawing the January 16, 2004, subpoena and\nmodifying the subpoena of March 3, 2004. The government\ndid not inform Judge White of these actions and the January\n16 subpoena was never withdrawn.\n\n   On April 24, CDT and the Players Association filed a\nmotion in the Central District of California for return of the\nseized property or, in the alternative, appointment of a special\nmaster to redact those records so that the government retained\ndrug test results for only the ten players named in the warrant.\n\n   On April 30, 2004, the government filed its opposition to\nthe motion to return property in the Central District. In its\nopposition, despite the existence of an agreement with CDT\nthat CDT would not destroy or alter documents, the govern-\nment argued that it “had good-faith reasons to believe that\nCDT was detrimentally delaying the investigation, and that\nthere was some danger of the sought-after records being jeop-\nardized.” The government also argued that this jeopardy justi-\nfied proceeding with a search warrant under DOJ guidelines.\n\n  On the same date, April 30, 2004, based on what it had\nfound in the first search, the government sought a new search\nwarrant in the Northern District of California in San Jose for\nCDT electronic files it already had in its possession in the\nTracey Directory concerning all players whose test results\nwere positive.\n\n   In contrast to the affidavit supplied in the first warrant\napplication, which purported to “to ensure that samples of\nindividuals not associated with Balco are left undisturbed,”\nthe affidavit of Agent Novitzky in support of this warrant\napplication sought “authorization to conduct a thorough\n\f19842   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nreview of all major league baseball-related computer data”\nand “to seize all data pertaining to illegal drug use by any\nmember of major league baseball.”\n\fUNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING   19843\n                                    Volume 2 of 2\n\f19844   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n\n\n\n   The affidavit conceded that no specific information had\nbeen uncovered linking Balco to any individual baseball play-\ners beyond the ten listed in the April 7, 2004, search warrant.\nHowever, in contrast to the first warrant application, Agent\nNovitzky averred that even though there was no evidence that\nhad been developed to link the ballplayers who were not listed\nin the first warrant to Balco, “it is logical to assume that a\nreview of the drug testing records for other players may pro-\nvide additional evidence of the use of similar illegal\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19845\nperformance-enhancing drugs which establishes a link to the\ncharged defendants in the charged [Balco] case, given the rel-\natively small number of professional baseball players and the\nclosely-knit professional baseball community.”\n\n   The affidavit in support of issuance of the warrant did not\ndisclose that a grand jury subpoena had been issued for the\nsame material and that a motion to quash the subpoena was\npending in the very same district.\n\n   The affidavit also did not disclose that the parties were liti-\ngating in the Central District of California a motion for return\nof the seized property — the very property which was subject\nof the new search warrant request. Based on the information\nprovided by the government, Magistrate Judge Howard W.\nLloyd issued a new search warrant for the same material that\nthe government had already searched and seized.\n\n   On May 5, 2004, the government sought a search warrant\nin the District of Nevada for information contained in the files\nat Quest Diagnostics concerning all baseball players who,\naccording to the information collected in the CDT search, had\ntested positive for steroids. The application conceded that\nthere was no specific evidence linking these players to Balco.\nThe warrant was issued by Magistrate Judge Leavitt. A large\nnumber of physical samples of bodily fluids were taken (later\nreported by the government to be 250 to 300 because of mul-\ntiple samples given by the players), which the government\ntransported to a lab in Los Angeles.\n\n   On May 5, 2004, the government sought a search warrant\nin the Central District of California in Los Angeles before a\ndifferent magistrate judge for all information contained in the\nfiles at CDT concerning all baseball players who, according\nto the information collected in the CDT search, had a positive\nmarker for steroids. The application conceded that there was\nno specific evidence linking these players to Balco. Neither\nthe application nor the affidavit filed in support of the applica-\n\f19846   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ntion disclosed the pending proceedings concerning the grand\njury subpoenas. Based on the information provided by the\ngovernment, the warrant was issued by Magistrate Judge\nRosalyn Chapman.\n\n   On May 6, 2004, after it had executed the search warrants,\nthe government served grand jury subpoenas on CDT and\nQuest for the same materials it had sought in the April 30 and\nMay 5 search warrants. The subpoena contained the names of\nthe baseball players that had allegedly tested positive, even\nthough the government knew that the information Quest pos-\nsessed was only identifiable by number and even though the\ngovernment had assured the Players Association and Judge\nWhite that it would not disclose the names. The government\nsent a letter to Quest Diagnostics instructing the company not\nto disclose to anyone the government’s request for documents\n“indefinitely” because “[a]ny such disclosure could impede\nthe investigation being conducted and thereby interfere with\nthe enforcement of the law.”\n\n   On May 21, 2004, CDT and the Players Association filed\na motion in the District of Nevada for a return of the property\nseized from Quest Diagnostics. On June 7, 2004, CDT and the\nPlayers Association filed a motion in the Northern District of\nCalifornia for return of the electronic documents seized from\nCDT pursuant to the April 30 search warrant issued by Magis-\ntrate Judge Lloyd in the Northern District.\n\n   On July 9, 2004, Judge White held a hearing on the motion\nto quash the grand jury subpoenas, but deferred action pend-\ning rulings on the motions for return of property seized pursu-\nant to the search warrants.\n\n   On August 9, 2004, Judge Susan Illston held a hearing on\nthe motion for return of the electronic data seized by the gov-\nernment pursuant to the April 30 warrant. When asked by\nJudge Illston why the government hadn’t just waited to let\nJudge White rule on the motions to quash the grand jury sub-\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            19847\npoena rather than seeking search warrants for the same mate-\nrial, the government responded:\n\n      What the government really perceived ultimately as\n      a conscious decision on the part of the Major League\n      Baseball Players Association and the other parties\n      associated with it just refused to comply with what\n      the government felt was [sic] legitimate grand jury\n      subpoenas.\n\n   Later in the hearing the government argued that the search\nwarrant was necessary because a motion to quash had been\nfiled.\n\n      Counsel: The concern here was, to say, okay, we’re\n               going to face a brick wall from this legal\n               avenue . . . .\n\n      Judge:      What brick wall?\n\n      Counsel: The brick wall was . . .\n\n      Judge:      Judge White?\n\n      Counsel: No, no, not at all. It was the concern that\n               the requests or that discussions about\n               moving to quash the subpoena would be\n               something that would be dragged out.\n\n   At a later hearing, counsel for government confirmed that\nit would not have sought to obtain the search warrants if the\naffected parties had not filed a motion to quash the grand jury\nsubpoena.3 However, the Department of Justice Guidelines\n  3\n   A hearing on December 10, 2004, discussed infra, contains this collo-\nquy:\n      Counsel:   And the government never would have done the\n                 search warrants if the grand jury process could have\n\f19848    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nprovide that “The fact that the disinterested third party pos-\nsessing the materials may have grounds to challenge a sub-\npoena or other legal process is not in itself a legitimate basis\nfor the use of a search warrant.” 28 C.F.R. § 59.4.\n\n   The government primarily argued that, even though the\nmaterial seized may not have been authorized under the\nsearch warrant, seizure was appropriate under the “plain\nview” doctrine. The court engaged in an extensive colloquy\nabout the search, ascertaining that the data was contained in\na file that could not be accessed readily without assistance,\nand that the agent had to scroll through 1,200 results to obtain\nthe positive tests that formed the basis of the later search war-\nrants. After noting that the government had not provided any\ncase to support its contention that the plain view doctrine\napplied in the computer context, Judge Illston made the fol-\nlowing findings:\n\n    I find absolutely staggering the implications about\n    what you say about the plain view doctrine in the\n    computer set up. In a way nothing is in plain view\n    because with the disk you look at it, you don’t see\n    anything until you stick it in the computer and it\n    does take quite a lot of work really to bring it up on\n    the screen.\n\n              worked out. But it didn’t. I feel —\n   Court:     Say that last thing one more time. What you —\n   Counsel:   What I just said was we may not have ever done the\n              search warrants if the subpoena process worked out.\n   Court:     But, I mean, there was a subpoena process pending in\n              this building before Judge White.\n   Counsel:   Yes.\n   Court:     At the time you went and got your search warrants,\n              and you didn’t allow that process to complete itself.\n   Counsel:   That is true.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19849\n    So, it’s not in plain view in the sense of walking into\n    the room and seeing the scale on the desk. It takes\n    a whole lot of work to get there.\n\n    First off, none of it is cursory, there are whole indus-\n    tries that have developed in order to make it possible\n    for the disk to show up on the screen that way. So\n    it’s not cursory review. I don’t think it’s plain view.\n    I don’t think I have to go that far or make that kind\n    of choice with respect to issues that are certainly\n    going to arise. . . . Where it requires sorting through\n    information which really is on a data base, somehow\n    it’s being organized in different formats, you could\n    organize it in a format based on the ten names,\n    instead of taking it in other kinds of formats, then\n    scrolling across and taking names and information\n    off the screen, when it’s clearly information that\n    isn’t part of what was originally within the autho-\n    rized search warrant, I just think is impermissible.\n\n  Judge Illston then granted the motion for return of seized\nproperty, with the following findings from the bench:\n\n       So, having looked at the Ramsden factors set out,\n    [there are] apparently four factors. One, whether the\n    government displayed a callous disregard for the\n    constitutional rights, two, whether the [movant] has\n    an individual right and need for the property he\n    wants returned, three, whether the [movant] would\n    be irreparably injured by denying the motion for\n    return of property, and four, whether the [movant]\n    has an adequate remedy at law for a redress of his\n    grievance. I find all four factors have been met here.\n\n       I think the government has displayed, in the chro-\n    nology of things that we’ve seen, in the way that the\n    case was taken from one judge to another judge, in\n    the way that as soon as it was challenged in one\n\f19850   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    court, it was immediately litigated in another court\n    without full information being shared among the\n    courts, that to me makes it a callous disregard for\n    constitutional rights. I think, it’s a seizure beyond\n    what was authorized by the search warrant, therefore\n    it violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\n       Number two, I think [that both movants] here\n    have an interest and need for the property returned.\n    I think they need it returned and not so much\n    because they need it back, they got it, you got it, I\n    think what they need to get back from you what they\n    have, what you’ve taken from them because of the\n    privacy rights and the circumstances under which\n    this material was given.\n\n       Whether the [movant] would be irreparably\n    injured by denying the return of the property, I think\n    they would, and I think indeed there would be, that\n    the injury that will be suffered by volunteers not\n    being able to confidently provide testing under\n    promise of privacy would irreparably injure not only\n    major league baseball, I can’t imagine that there’s\n    going to be any voluntary agreement to do this kind\n    of testing, that’s probably over with already, but also\n    just has implications that are very negative for these\n    [movants], and whether the [movant] has an ade-\n    quate remedy at law, I don’t think there is any rem-\n    edy at law for the redress of these grievances.\n\n    I’m going to grant the motion.\n\n   On August 13, in the Central District of California, Magis-\ntrate Judge Johnson issued a report and recommendation rec-\nommending denial of the motion for return of property seized\nat CDT.\n\n On August 19, in the District of Nevada, Judge James C.\nMahan held a hearing on the motion filed by the Players\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19851\nAssociation for the return of the property seized at Quest\nDiagnostics pursuant to the search warrants. The government\ndid not disclose to Judge Mahan or the Players Association\nthat it had served on Quest a grand jury subpoena for the same\nmaterials, coupled with a letter instructing Quest to keep that\nfact confidential indefinitely. At the conclusion of the hearing,\nJudge Mahan orally granted the motion. On September 7,\nJudge Mahan filed a written order granting the motion for\nreturn of the property. Judge Mahan found, in relevant part,\nthat:\n\n    2.   Under Ramsden v. United States, 2 F.3d 322\n         (9th Cir. 1993), this Court has equitable jurisdic-\n         tion to order return of that seized property. All\n         of the factors identified in Ramsden supporting\n         jurisdiction are present. The government cal-\n         lously disregarded the affected players’ constitu-\n         tional rights. The MLBPA, as representative for\n         the players, has an individual interest in and\n         need for the property that it wants returned. The\n         MLBPA would be irreparably injured if the\n         property were not returned. And the MLBPA\n         has no adequate remedy at law for redress of the\n         grievances.\n\n    3.   Under the particular circumstances of this case,\n         it was unreasonable for the Government to\n         refuse to follow the procedures set forth in\n         United States v. Tamura, 694 F.2d 591 (9th Cir.\n         1982), upon learning that drug-testing records\n         for the ten athletes named in the original April\n         8 warrants executed at Quest and at Comprehen-\n         sive Drug Testing, Inc. were co-mingled with\n         records for other athletes not named in those\n         warrants.\n\n   After issuance of the order, the government declined to\nreturn the material seized from Quest in Nevada, contending\n\f19852   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nit was entitled to retain it under the authority of the new May\n6 grand jury subpoena. To that end, the government filed a\nstay motion with Judge Mahan, arguing that it had a right to\nretain the data and samples based on the May 6 grand jury\nsubpoena, which had issued after the seizures of the material\nhad occurred. The government argued that Judge White was\nthe only judge who had jurisdiction to decide that issue. Judge\nMahan denied the stay motion. The government maintained\nthat the May 6 grand jury subpoenas independently authorized\nretention of the data and specimens; therefore, the Players\nAssociation and CDT filed a motion to quash the May 6 sub-\npoena in the Northern District of California.\n\n   On October 1, 2004, in the Central District of California,\nJudge Cooper declined to adopt Magistrate Judge Johnson’s\nrecommendation, and granted the motion for return of the\nseized CDT property. She noted that she joined “an appar-\nently ever increasing number of district judges who have held\nthat the Government’s execution of the Search Warrant at\nissue in this case demonstrated a callous disregard for the con-\nstitutional rights of the movants and their members.”\n\n  With respect to the Ramsden factors, Judge Cooper found:\n\n       All four considerations weigh in favor of the mov-\n    ing parties in this case. In assessing whether the gov-\n    ernment displayed a callous disregard for the rights\n    of the persons whose records were seized, it is\n    important to focus on the Ninth Circuit opinion in\n    United States v. Tamura, 694 F.2d 591 (1982). At\n    the time of the search, Tamura was certainly settled\n    law in the Circuit, and Tamura establishes a proce-\n    dure to be followed when documents to be seized are\n    intermingled with other documents. “. . . . [T]he\n    wholesale seizure for later detained examination of\n    records not described in a warrant is significantly\n    more intrusive, and has been characterized as ‘the\n    kind of investigatory dragnet that the fourth amend-\n\f    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19853\nment was designed to prevent.’[citation].” Id. at 595.\nTherefore, law enforcement officials are to seal and\nhold such intermingled documents “pending\napproval by a magistrate of a further search . . . .\nWholesale removal must be monitored by the judg-\nment of a neutral, detached magistrate.” Id. at 596.\nIt is particularly telling in this case that just such a\nprocedure was proposed to the Government at the\ntime of the search, and rejected.\n\n   Nor is the viewing of the seized files legitimized\nby the Plain View doctrine. Under the exception to\nthe warrant requirement, an officer may seize what\nhe plainly views, so long as he has a lawful right to\naccess the evidence itself and its incriminating char-\nacter is immediately apparent. Horton v. California,\n496 U.S. 128, 136 (1990). Here, the agent did not\nhave a lawful right to access the computer records\nand diskettes, and, as evidence provided in connec-\ntion with the Motion reveals, the evidence observed\nis not necessarily incriminating. The Declaration of\nDr. Joseph states that the ingestion of nutritional\nsupplements can produce a “positive” test for ste-\nroids.\n\n   The Government demonstrated a callous disregard\nfor the rights of persons whose records were seized\nand searched outside the warrants.\n\n   The second consideration, whether the moving\nparty has an interest and need for return of the prop-\nerty, is easily answered. The athletes in question vol-\nuntarily submitted to urine testing for steroids, as\npart of an agreement that all results would remain\nconfidential and be used only for statistical analysis.\nTheir interest in privacy is obvious.\n\n  The third consideration, whether the moving party\nhas an interest and need for return of the property is\n\f19854   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    easily answered. The careers of these athletes could\n    be profoundly, negatively affected by release of\n    these records, and their return is vitally important.\n    The harm they would suffer if the records were\n    released (even if the positive tests are shown to be\n    innocuous) would be irreparable.\n\n       Finally, it is evident that the movants have no\n    other legal remedy. No motion to suppress the evi-\n    dence is available to them; they are neither defen-\n    dants nor suspects, and no case exists in which this\n    issue could be litigated.\n\n  In addition to her findings and conclusions, Judge Cooper\nadded these comments in a section labeled “Serious Con-\ncerns:”\n\n       The documents presented to the Court in connec-\n    tion with this Motion reveal extremely troubling\n    conduct on the part of the Government. The picture\n    painted is one of almost desperate effort to acquire\n    evidence by whatever means could be utilized. The\n    Government negotiated with movants’ attorneys\n    over the breadth of the grand jury subpoenas;\n    received assurances in writing that the records of the\n    ten athletes would be secured while the Court\n    resolved the issue, and the day after the issue was\n    presented to a Court, went to another district and\n    sought a search warrant. That conduct would be sus-\n    pect in itself. But in seeking the warrant (not the cor-\n    rect procedure for obtaining documents for a third\n    party who is not a suspect), the Government\n    explained to the Magistrate that the records in ques-\n    tion were in danger of being destroyed. This is bla-\n    tant misrepresentation, as demonstrated by the\n    records in this case.\n\n     Four days after Movants filed a motion before\n    Magistrate Judge Johnson for return of the property,\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING      19855\n    the Government obtained a further warrant from a\n    Magistrate Judge in the Northern District of Califor-\n    nia. And while a motion for return of that property\n    was pending, the Government obtained two more\n    warrants in the Central District of California (not\n    from Magistrate Judge Johnson) and in Nevada. The\n    image of quickly and skillfully moving the cup so no\n    one can find the pea would be humorous if the mat-\n    ter were not so serious.\n\n   Noting that “the Government is held to a far higher stan-\ndard than has been demonstrated in this case,” and that “this\nis the third District Court Order compelling the Government\nto return property illegally seized,” Judge Cooper ordered\nreturn of the seized CDT property forthwith.\n\n   On December 10, 2004, Judge Illston held a hearing on the\nPlayers Association motion to intervene and to quash the May\n6, 2004 grand jury subpoenas served on CDT and Quest. At\nthe conclusion of the hearing, Judge Illston made the follow-\ning oral findings and conclusions:\n\n       I find that the MLBPA has the right to intervene\n    in this matter under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n    24(a), as it has an interest in the samples and test\n    results in the possession of CDT and Quest, which\n    were created with the promise of anonymity under\n    the mandatory testing of the 2002 collective bargain-\n    ing agreement.\n\n       The May 6th, 2004 subpoenas were the culmina-\n    tion of a series of actions taken by the government\n    in order to prevent MLBPA and CDT’s attempt to\n    move to quash the January and March subpoenas.\n    Instead of allowing the matter to be resolved in a sin-\n    gle proceeding before Judge White, the government\n    executed a series of search warrants in three different\n\f19856   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    districts once it learned that petitioners would move\n    to quash the January and March subpoenas.\n\n       The government has provided no substantial\n    explanation of why this course of action was neces-\n    sary. Given that the government had no other basis\n    for issuing the April search warrants and preempting\n    the subpoenas served of Quest and CDT, the deci-\n    sion appears to have been a tactical decision to pre-\n    vent the parties from raising objections before Judge\n    White, which is unreasonable and constitutes harass-\n    ment similar to the conduct in United States v. Amer-\n    ican Honda.\n\n       Furthermore, the May 6th subpoenas were served\n    after the government had obtained evidence pursuant\n    to the April 7 and April 30 search warrants, which\n    has now been determined to have been illegally\n    seized. Some of the information sought in the May\n    6th subpoena was already in the government’s pos-\n    session at the time the subpoena was served on CDT\n    and Quest; therefore, the Court finds that the May\n    6th subpoena served as an unreasonable insurance\n    policy as recognized in the motion for the return of\n    seized property cited in the papers, 681 F.Supp. [sic]\n\n      For these reasons the court grants petitioner’s\n    motion to quash the May 6th subpoena served on\n    Quest and CDT as an abuse of the grand jury process\n    and unreasonable under Federal Rule of Criminal\n    Procedure 17(c).\n\n   On October 18, 2005, as a result of a plea agreement, Balco\nfounder Victor Conte received a sentence of eight months\nimprisonment, with four months of the sentence to be served\nin home confinement. James Valente, Balco’s vice president,\nwas sentenced to probation. Trainer Greg Anderson was sen-\ntenced to six months imprisonment, with three of the six\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19857\nmonths to be spent in home confinement. On February 25,\n2006, track coach Remi Korchemny was sentenced to one\nyear of probation.\n\n   In reviewing both the order quashing the grand jury sub-\npoena and the orders granting the motions for return of prop-\nerty pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g), we review the factual\nfindings of the district courts for clear error. In re Grand Jury\nSubpoenas Dated Dec. 10, 1987, 926 F.2d 847, 854 (9th Cir.\n1991) (orders to quash grand jury subpoenas); United States\nv. Marolf, 173 F.3d 1213, 1216 (9th Cir. 1999) (orders on\nmotions for return of property). We review orders quashing\nsubpoenas for abuse of discretion. United States v. Bergeson,\n425 F.3d 1221, 1224 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing In re Grand Jury\nSubpoena, 357 F.3d 900, 906 (9th Cir. 2004)). We review de\nnovo a district court’s denial of a motion for return of prop-\nerty pursuant to Rule 41(g). Marolf, 173 F.3d at 1216.\n\n                               II\n\n   There are two preliminary jurisdictional questions: (1)\nwhether the Players Association had standing to file the Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 41(g) motions for return of property on behalf of\nits members, and (2) whether the government timely appealed\nJudge Cooper’s order granting the Rule 41(g) motion.\n\n   I agree with the majority that the Players Association had\norganizational standing to file the Rule 41(g) motion for\nreturn of the records and specimens seized from Quest. For\nthe same reasons—although the majority does not reach this\nissue—I would also hold that the Players Association had\norganizational standing to file the Rule 41(g) motion for\nreturn of the property seized from CDT.\n\n   However, I respectfully disagree that the government\ntimely appealed Judge Cooper’s order granting the motion for\nreturn of property.\n\f19858    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                 A\n\n   It is undisputed that the government’s notice of appeal was\nfiled more than sixty days after judgment was entered which,\nin the ordinary course, would make the appeal untimely. Fed.\nR. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).4 “A timely appeal is required to vest\nthis court with jurisdiction.” Fiester v. Turner, 783 F.2d 1474,\n1475 (9th Cir. 1986). The Players Association contends that\nwe lack jurisdiction due to the government’s untimely filing.\nThe government contends that the time for filing an appeal\nwas tolled by its filing of a “Motion for Reconsideration” with\nthe district court.\n\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not provide for\n“Motions for Reconsideration.” Rather, such motions are\ncreatures of local rule or practice. In this case, the govern-\nment’s motion was filed pursuant to Local Rule 7-18 of the\nCentral District of California. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n83 authorizes district courts to make rules governing their\nown practices so long as they are “not inconsistent with [the\nFederal Rules].” Where a conflict arises between the two, fed-\neral rules must prevail. Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. 149, 161\nn.18 (1973); see also Loya v. Desert Sands Unified Sch. Dist.,\n721 F.2d 279, 280 (9th Cir. 1983); 28 U.S.C.A. § 2071(a)\n(providing that rules adopted by district courts must be con-\nsistent with the federal rules of procedure).\n\n   Thus, when faced with a motion for reconsideration under\nlocal rules, we must either harmonize the rule, or reject it as\nin conflict with the national uniform rules. See Marshall v.\nGates, 44 F.3d 722, 725 (9th Cir. 1995) (“We are, however,\nunder an obligation to construe local rules so that they do not\nconflict with the federal rules, and we have exercised our\ningenuity in doing so.”)\n  4\n    The judgment was filed October 10, 2004. The Notice of Appeal was\nfiled March 9, 2005.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19859\n   For the purposes of appeal, when a local rule based post-\njudgment motion for reconsideration is made premised on an\nargument that there was a “manifest showing . . . of a failure\nto consider material facts,” we construe it either as (1) a\nmotion to alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59(e) or (2)\na motion filed under 60(b) for relief from judgment under\nRule 59(e). Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1441-42\n(9th Cir. 1991).5 Whether we construe the motion as filed\nunder Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) depends on the timing. Am.\nIronworks & Erectors Inc. v. N. Am. Constr. Corp., 248 F.3d\n892, 898-99 (9th Cir. 2001). If the motion for reconsideration\nis filed within ten days of the entry of judgment, we construe\nit as filed under Rule 59(e). Shapiro ex rel. Shapiro v. Para-\ndise Valley Unified School Dist. No. 69, 374 F.3d 857, 863\n(9th Cir. 2004); Am. Ironworks, 248 F.3d at 898-99; United\nStates v. Nutri-cology, Inc., 982 F.2d 394, 397 (9th Cir. 1992).\nThis construction is in accord with Rule 59(e), which provides\nthat a motion to alter or amend the judgment “shall be filed\nno later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.” Fed. R.\nCiv. Pro. 59(e).\n\n   If the motion is filed more than ten days after entry of judg-\nment, we construe it as being filed under Rule 60(b). Am.\nIronworks, 248 F.3d at 899; Mt. Graham Red Squirrel v.\nMadigan, 954 F.2d 1441, 1463 n.35 (9th Cir. 1992); Straw v.\n  5\n    The majority admits that the government’s motion was made “pre-\ncisely on these grounds,” but contends that a motion on these grounds\ndoes not conflict with either Federal Rule 59(e) or 60(b). That conclusion\nis squarely precluded by a long line of precedent, as I have cited, in which\nwe have held that a local-rule based motion on those grounds is to be con-\nstrued under one of the two Federal Rules. Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1442;\nSchroeder v. McDonald, 55 F.3d 454, 459 (9th Cir. 1995). Fuller itself\ninvolved the local rule of the Central District of California governing\nmotions for reconsideration—the precise rule at issue here. A contrary rule\nwould not make any sense and would leave the critical question of appel-\nlate jurisdiction to the whim of local rule. We have to determine as a mat-\nter of appellate jurisdiction whether the appeal is timely under the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\n\f19860    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nBowen, 866 F.2d 1167, 1171-72 (9th Cir. 1989); Gould v.\nMutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, 790 F.2d 769, 772 (9th Cir.\n1986),\n\n   The difference between the rules is important. A timely\nfiled motion pursuant to Rule 59(e) will toll the time for filing\na notice of appeal from the underlying judgment until the dis-\ntrict court denies the Rule 59(e) motion. Shapiro, 374 F.3d at\n863. However, the filing of an untimely Rule 59(e) motion\ndoes not toll the running of the appeal period. Scott v. Youn-\nger, 739 F.2d 1464, 1467 (9th Cir. 1984) (citing Cel-A-Pak v.\nCalifornia Agric. Labor Relations Bd., 680 F.2d 664, 666 (9th\nCir. 1982)). The ten day time limit in Rule 59(e) “is jurisdic-\ntional and cannot be extended by the court.” Id. Indeed, Fed-\neral Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b), which allows for\nenlargement of time to file, states that a court “may not extend\nthe time for taking any action under . . . [59(e)] . . . , except\nto the extent and under the conditions stated [in the section\nitself].” Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 6(b).\n\n   The filing of a Rule 60(b) does not toll the time for appeal-\ning from the underlying judgment. Nutri-Cology, 982 F.2d at\n397. Therefore, unlike an appeal from a denial of a Rule 59(e)\nmotion, “ ‘[a]n appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion\nbrings up only the denial of the motion for review, not the\nmerits of the underlying judgment.’ ” Briones v. Riviera Hotel\n& Casino, 116 F.3d 379, 380 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Floyd\nv. Laws, 929 F.2d 1390, 1400 (9th Cir. 1991)); see also Mol-\nloy v. Wilson, 878 F.2d 313, 315 (9th Cir. 1989); Straw v.\nBowen, 866 F.2d at 1171; Schanen v. United States Dept. of\nJustice, 762 F.2d 805, 807 (9th Cir. 1985), as modified, 798\nF.2d 348 (1986).\n\n  Here, it is undisputed that the government’s post-judgment\nmotion for reconsideration of the order was not timely filed.\nJudge Cooper filed the order on October 1, 2004; the govern-\nment did not file its motion to reconsider until November 23,\n2004. Because the government’s motion to reconsider was\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19861\nfiled outside the ten day time limit specified in Rule 59(e), we\nmust construe the motion as filed under Rule 60(b). Am. Iron-\nworks, 248 F.3d at 899; Mt. Graham Red Squirrel, 954 F.2d\nat 1463 n.35.\n\n   For these reasons, I disagree with the analysis offered by\nthe parties and by the majority. The government’s argument\nthat “courts liberally construe post-judgment motions as ade-\nquate to toll the time for filing a notice of appeal” is squarely\nforeclosed by circuit law under these circumstances. The\ncases cited by the government pertain only to motions timely\nfiled within the ten day period described in Rule 59(e), not to\nmotions filed outside the ten day window. See, e.g., Taylor v.\nKnapp, 871 F.2d 803, 805 (9th Cir. 1988) (construing a vari-\nety of post judgment motions as filed under Rule 50(e) so\nlong as the motions were filed within ten days after the order\nor judgment).\n\n   Although I agree with the Players Association that we lack\njurisdiction over the merits of Judge Cooper’s original Rule\n41(g) order, I disagree that we lack jurisdiction over Judge\nCooper’s denial of the motion for reconsideration. The gov-\nernment’s notice of appeal was filed within sixty days after\nthe denial, so the appeal is timely as to the motion for recon-\nsideration.\n\n   I respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the majority that\nthe Central District’s local rule served to override the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure or our prior controlling precedent,\nwhich requires post-judgment motions to be filed within ten\ndays of the order or judgment in order to toll the time for fil-\ning a notice of appeal. Nutri-Cology, 982 F.2d at 397. The\ntime limits established for filing an appeal are “mandatory\nand jurisdictional.” Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections\nof Illinois, 434 U.S. 257, 264 (1978). The majority’s contrary\nview, as I have explained, is contrary to the plain language of\nRule 83, 28 U.S.C. § 2071(a), and controlling precedent.\n\f19862   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   To summarize: Consistent with our precedent and the rules,\nI would hold that the government’s untimely motion for\nreconsideration should be construed as a Rule 60(b) motion.\nBecause the government did not file a notice of appeal of the\noriginal order within the period required by Rule 4(a)(1)(B),\nwe lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the original\norder. I would hold that we have jurisdiction to consider the\ndistrict court’s denial of the motion for reconsideration, but\nour review is confined to it.\n\n                              B\n\n   We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration con-\nstrued as a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion, Sch.\nDist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., 5 F.3d\n1255, 1262 (9th Cir. 1993), and we will reverse a district\ncourt’s ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion “ ‘only upon a clear\nshowing of abuse of discretion.’ ” Pena v. Seguros La Comer-\ncial, S.A., 770 F.2d 811, 814 (9th Cir. 1985) (quoting Ellis v.\nBrotherhood of Railway, Airline & Steamship Clerks, 685\nF.2d 1065, 1071 (9th Cir. 1982)). Therefore, our review is\nconfined to whether Judge Cooper abused her discretion in\ndenying the government’s motion for reconsideration and\ndoes not extend to the merits of the underlying order.\n\n   When we review a motion for reconsideration under Rule\n60(b), we analyze the district court’s decision under the usual\nRule 60(b) factors, “which provide[ ] for reconsideration only\nupon a showing of (1) mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect;\n(2) newly discovered evidence; (3) fraud; (4) avoid judgment;\n(5) a satisfied or discharged judgment; or (6) ‘extraordinary\ncircumstances’ which would justify relief.” Fuller, 950 F.2d\nat 1442. In its reconsideration motion, the government did not\ncontend there was any mistake, surprise, excusable neglect,\nnewly discovered evidence, fraud, void judgment, satisfied or\ndischarged judgment, or extraordinary circumstances. Rather,\nthe government simply asked the district court to modify its\nfinding, suggesting that the court had failed to consider evi-\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19863\ndence already in the record. A district court does not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying a Rule 60(b) motion when it simply\nrepeats its earlier arguments. Backlund v. Barnhart, 778 F.2d\n1386, 1388 (9th Cir. 1985).\n\n   In response to the government’s motion, the district court\nexamined each of the government’s assertions that the court\nhad ignored evidence and arguments. In its order denying\nreconsideration, the district court carefully explained how it\nhad considered the evidence and arguments in the first\ninstance, but found them unconvincing. As the district court\nproperly concluded, the motion for reconsideration amounted\nonly to “[t]he Government’s mere disagreement with the\nCourt’s interpretation of the evidence and its opinions . . . .”\nUnder these circumstances, the district court certainly did not\nabuse its discretion in denying the government’s motion.6 I\nwould affirm the order of the district court denying the gov-\nernment’s motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                    III\n\n  I agree with the majority that the district courts properly\nexercised equitable jurisdiction over the Rule 41(g) motions.7\n   6\n     The local rule under which the motion was filed contains similar\nrestrictions to those contained in Rule 60(b). It provides that “[a] motion\nfor reconsideration on any motion may be made only on the grounds of\n(a) a material difference in law or fact from that presented to the Court\nbefore such decision that in the exercise of reasonable diligence could not\nhave been known to the party moving for reconsideration at the time of\nsuch decision, or (b) the emergence of new material factors or a change\nof law occurring after the time of such decision, or (c) a manifest showing\nof a failure to consider material facts presented to the Court before such\ndecision.” Local Rule 7-18. Clearly, the government offered no new evi-\ndence that was not available to it at the time the motion was made and no\nsuggestion of a change in law. Its only argument was that the district court\nfailed to consider material facts already presented, a contention that the\ndistrict court squarely addressed in its order.\n   7\n     For the purposes of this section, I will analyze Judge Cooper’s order\ngranting Rule 41(g) relief on the merits along with Judge Mahan’s similar\norder, even though I believe that we lack jurisdiction to consider the mer-\nits of Judge Cooper’s original order as I explained in Section II.\n\f19864    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nRamsden identified four factors that district courts must con-\nsider before exercising equitable jurisdiction to order the\nreturn of property, namely whether: (1) the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant; (2) the movant has an individual interest in and the\nneed for the property he wants returned; (3) the movant would\nbe irreparably injured by denying return of the property; and\n(4) the movant has an adequate remedy at law for the redress\nof his grievance. 2 F.3d at 324.\n\n   Although I agree with the majority that the district courts\nproperly exercised equitable jurisdiction, I disagree with the\nmajority’s analysis in reaching that conclusion. Because the\nequitable jurisdictional analysis in large part drives the analy-\nsis of the merits of the Rule 41(g) decisions, it is important\nto detail my differences with the majority on the issue.\n\n                               A\n\n   The first Ramsden factor is whether the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant. The majority concludes the government did not. I\nrespectfully disagree with that conclusion. The record amply\nsupports the conclusion of the district courts that the govern-\nment displayed callous disregard for the constitutional rights\nof the movants.\n\n                               1\n\n   The district judges concluded, among other things, that the\ngovernment sought and executed the search warrants and took\nsubsequent legal action as a tactical measure to prevent the\nPlayers Association and CDT from litigating their motion to\nquash and other objections to the wholesale production of\nCDT data. The record supports this conclusion. The govern-\nment applied for, and executed, the initial search warrants\nafter CDT and the Players Association informed the govern-\nment it would be filing a motion to quash the grand jury sub-\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19865\npoenas. Government counsel conceded on the record that the\nmotivation for seeking the search warrants was the “brick\nwall” presented by the filing of the motions to quash, even\nthough DOJ guidelines state that “[t]he fact that the disinter-\nested third party possessing the materials may have grounds\nto challenge a subpoena or other legal process is not in itself\na legitimate basis for the use of a search warrant.” 28 C.F.R.\n§ 59.4.\n\n   The majority repeatedly points out that the DOJ guidelines\ndo not give rise to substantive rights. That may be so, but it\nis beside the point. The guidelines form a baseline from which\nto judge the reasonableness of unjustified deviations from the\nstandard practices they outline. The guidelines plainly state\nthat it is not legitimate to use a search warrant because a party\nmay be challenging a subpoena; the government admitted that\nthis was precisely the reason it issued the warrants in this\ncase.\n\n   Further, as Judge Cooper found, the use of a search warrant\nto obtain documents from a third party is inappropriate. The\nDepartment of Justice Guidelines address this point specifi-\ncally:\n\n    A search warrant should not be used to obtain docu-\n    mentary materials believed to be in the private pos-\n    session of a disinterested third party unless it appears\n    that the use of a subpoena, summons, request, or\n    other less intrusive alternative means of obtaining\n    the materials would substantially jeopardize the\n    availability or usefulness of the materials sought, and\n    the application for the warrant has been authorized\n    as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n28 C.F.R. § 59.4(a)(1); see also U.S. Attorney’s Manual § 9-\n19.210.\n\f19866     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n  The U.S. Attorney’s Manual also provides that a search\nwarrant should normally not be used to obtain confidential\nmaterials such as treatment records. §§ 9-19.220, 9-19.230.\n\n   The simple and undisputed fact is that the government\ndeviated from its usual and appropriate protocol. Documents\nheld in the possession of third parties are appropriately\nobtained through use of grand jury subpoena, not search war-\nrant. The record is quite clear that the government used the\nvehicle of a search warrant only because it thought its grand\njury subpoenas might be contested. As the DOJ Guidelines\nrecognize, that is an inappropriate use of a search warrant.\nThe district judges were entitled on the basis of the record to\nfind that the government undertook this action in an attempt\nto prevent the Players Association and CDT from litigating\nthe merits of their objections to the grand jury subpoenas.\n\n   Further, the entire record of the case shows a repeated pat-\ntern of the government attempting to prevent a full hearing on\nthe merits of the Players Association legal challenges. In vir-\ntually each hearing in which CDT and the Players Association\narticulated their objections, the government argued that\nanother court had primary jurisdiction or that the action of\nanother court dictated the result.8 The record supports the dis-\ntrict courts’ collective conclusion that, as Judge Cooper put it,\nthe government’s actions constituted a “desperate effort to\n  8\n    To provide but a few examples: Before Judge White, who was consid-\nering the initial motion to quash, the government argued that he should\ndefer ruling because he had no jurisdiction over the materials seized by the\nwarrant. The government urged Judge Illston to wait to decide the Rule\n41(g) motion until Magistrate Judge Johnson had ruled on the separate\nRule 41(g) motion. The government urged Judge Johnson to consider that\nprobable cause had already been established by the issuance of a search\nwarrant by Magistrate Judge Lloyd. The government contended Judge\nMahan lacked jurisdiction to order the property seized under the warrant\nreturned because it had separately obtained a grand jury subpoena for the\nsame item, urging him to wait until Judge White had ruled on the motion\nto quash (not disclosing that it had asked Judge White to defer until the\nRule 41(g) motions had been decided).\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING      19867\nacquire evidence by whatever means could be utilized,” by\nmeans of “quickly and skillfully moving the cup so no one\ncan find the pea.”\n\n                              2\n\n   The record also amply supports the conclusion of the dis-\ntrict courts that the government made misleading statements\nin its application for search warrants.\n\n   The application contained lengthy representations about\nhow computer data could be destroyed and stated that “while\nnot denying that they have the requested materials, CDT has\ndeclined to comply with the subpoena and has stated its intent\nto quash the subpoena.” The affidavit did not disclose that\nCDT had agreed in writing to keep the data and other materi-\nals secured until the scope of the grand jury subpoena was set-\ntled, either through negotiation or a ruling on a motion to\nquash. The affidavit did not disclose that the Chief of the\nCriminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office had\naccepted the assurances in writing.\n\n  Rather, the affidavit justified removing computer data and\nequipment from the searched premises on the basis that:\n\n    Computer users can attempt to conceal data within\n    computer equipment and storage devices through a\n    number of methods, including the use of innocuous\n    or misleading filenames and extensions. . . . Com-\n    puter users can also attempt to conceal data by using\n    encryption, which means that a password or device,\n    such as a “dongle” or “keycard,” is necessary to\n    decrypt the data into readable form. In addition,\n    computer users can conceal data within another\n    seemingly unrelated and innocuous file in a process\n    called “steganography.” For example, by using ste-\n    ganography, a computer user can conceal text in an\n    image file which cannot be viewed when the image\n\f19868    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    file is opened. Therefore, a substantial amount of\n    time is necessary to extract and sort through data that\n    is concealed or encrypted to determine whether it is\n    evidence, contraband or instrumentalities of a crime.\n\n   The affidavit also informed the magistrate judge that\n“[c]omputer hardware and storage devices may contain\n‘booby traps’ that destroy or alter data if certain procedures\nare not scrupulously followed.” It noted that computer data\nwas “particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nmodification or destruction.”\n\n   The government did not have any evidence or reason to\nbelieve that CDT had engaged in steganography, booby-\ntrapping computers, or any type of data destruction or alter-\nation. To the contrary, it had accepted in writing CDT’s assur-\nances “that CDT will maintain and preserve all materials\ncalled for by the first subpoena as well as any materials called\nfor by the new subpoena” and that “CDT would not destroy\nor alter any of the materials called for by either of the subpoe-\nnas.” The plain import of the application was that CDT was\nimproperly resisting compliance with a valid grand jury sub-\npoena and data was in jeopardy of being destroyed. It implied\nthat CDT was not being forthright about the information it\npossessed, when in fact there was no suggestion that CDT\nwas attempting to mislead the government in any respect.\n\n   The search warrant application did not disclose that the\nPlayers Association, on behalf of the individuals whose medi-\ncal files were at issue, had intervened and had joined CDT’s\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena. The application did\nnot disclose the history of negotiations between the parties,\nand that the concern was about the breadth of the subpoena.\nThe application did not disclose that the written assurances\nmade by CDT and accepted by the government contemplated\nresolving the disputed issues through a motion to quash if\nnecessary. Rather, the application implied that CDT was tak-\ning unjustified unilateral action.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19869\n   Given these undisputed facts, the district judges were enti-\ntled to find that the government had made misleading state-\nments in the search warrant applications.\n\n                               3\n\n   The record amply supports that finding that the actions of\nthe government in executing the search warrants were a mere\npretext for inappropriately obtaining confidential medical data\nabout Major League Baseball players who were not under any\nparticularized suspicion of criminal activity. The government\nfirst sought the information about all Major League Baseball\nplayers in its initial grand jury subpoena. After objection from\nthe Players Association and CDT, the government (without\nwithdrawing its initial subpoena) issued a new subpoena lim-\nited to information about players about whom the government\nhad a reasonable suspicion were connected to Balco.\n\n   The initial search warrant purported to be limited to the\nplayers associated with Balco. Indeed, the affidavit purported\nto justify obtaining information to link test results to individ-\nual players “to ensure that samples of individuals not associ-\nated with Balco are left undisturbed.” However, once it had\ntaken all of the data off site, it proceeded with new warrants\nto search the data it already possessed for evidence of positive\nsteroid markers. There was no evidence in the exhaustive\nBalco investigation that any of these players had any connec-\ntion to Balco, as the government concedes.\n\n   When the entire record is examined, it appears that the gov-\nernment was attempting to obtain all medical data about all\nMajor League Baseball players, and using the search warrant\nfor the limited number of players as a pretext for doing so.\nThe procedure employed by the government at the search but-\ntresses this conclusion. CDT had segregated the information\nabout the ballplayers who were the subject of the search war-\nrant. However, the agents insisted on taking the entire direc-\ntory of information about all players. To the extent the data\n\f19870   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nresponsive to the warrant had not been provided in the segre-\ngated material, the information could have easily been iso-\nlated on site. Yet the government insisted on removing the\nentire directory.\n\n   CDT suggested using the Tamura procedure, under which\na magistrate judge would first examine the data and segregate\nthe non-confidential material. However, the government\nrejected that approach. Instead, the government seized every-\nthing, then examined it, then sought additional search war-\nrants as protection against its unauthorized search.\n\n   These facts, among many others from the record, more than\nadequately support the conclusion that the government used\nthe limited warrants as a pretext for conducting an unautho-\nrized general search—a tactic we rejected in United States v.\nRettig, 589 F.2d 418 (9th Cir. 1978).\n\n                               4\n\n   The majority finally justifies the government’s actions by\nconcluding that the government had the right to seize all of\nthe medical data because the data was “intermingled” with\ndata responsive to the warrant. This conclusion is the one with\nwhich I have the most profound disagreement with the major-\nity.\n\n   There is no doubt that the agents did not comply with the\nwarrant. They seized an enormous amount of personal prop-\nerty belonging to individuals not under any suspicion of crim-\ninal activity. A warrantless search is, of course, presumptively\nunreasonable. United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 714-15\n(1984). As the Supreme Court explained in Coolidge v. New\nHampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 454-55 (1971):\n\n    Thus the most basic constitutional rule in this area is\n    that searches conducted outside the judicial process,\n    without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19871\n    per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment—\n    subject only to a few specifically established and\n    well delineated exceptions. The exceptions are jeal-\n    ously and carefully drawn, and there must be a\n    showing by those who seek exemption [ ] that the\n    exigencies of the situation made that course impera-\n    tive. The burden is on those seeking the exemption\n    to show the need for it. (quotation marks and cita-\n    tions omitted).\n\n   The government concedes that it had no probable cause or\neven particularized reasonable suspicion that could have\nformed the basis for the issuance of a search warrant to obtain\nthe physical samples, and the data obtained from testing the\nsamples, concerning the players who were not involved in the\nBalco investigation. The government’s particularized warrants\nwere limited to ten identified players whom the government\nalleged it had reason to believe were involved with Balco.\n\n   The majority endorses the warrantless seizure and search of\nconfidential medical information pertaining to individuals not\nunder any criminal suspicion, reasoning that the existence of\na handful of relevant records justifies the seizure and subse-\nquent search of thousands of irrelevant records. I respectfully\ndisagree.\n\n   The majority’s holding squarely conflicts with our prior\nprecedent. For decades, we have eschewed the indiscriminate\nsearch and seizure of materials that are not responsive to a\nvalid search warrant. In Tamura, we stated that “the whole-\nsale seizure for later detailed examination of records not\ndescribed in a warrant . . . has been characterized as ‘the kind\nof investigatory dragnet that the fourth amendment was\ndesigned to prevent.’ ” 694 F.2d at 595 (quoting United States\nv. Abrams, 615 F.2d 541, 543 (1st Cir. 1980)). Tamura held\nthat “the government’s wholesale seizure of company docu-\nments [is] illegal [when] the agents intentionally seize[ ]\nmaterials they [know] were not covered by the warrant.”\n\f19872     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nUnited States v. Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 1088 (C.D. Cal.\n2004) (Kozinski, J., sitting by designation).\n\n   Here, it was clear to the investigating officers that they\nwere seizing a sizable amount of data that was not responsive\nto the warrant. Indeed, the Tracey directory itself was deter-\nmined to contain 2,911 files, with an unknown amount of data\nin each file, that were not connected with Major League Base-\nball player drug testing at all. The directory contained test\nresults for thirteen other sports organizations, two business\nentities, and three sports competitions. The sub-directories\nwere quite clearly named, so that it was obvious to the casual\nobserver that if the files in the directories correlated to the\nname—and there was no reason to think otherwise—the mate-\nrial had nothing to do with the ten players listed in the war-\nrant. In the files that concerned Major League Baseball\nplayers, there was information on approximately 1,200 play-\ners, with multiple test results.9\n\n   The majority relies on United States v. Beusch, 596 F.2d\n871 (9th Cir. 1979), to establish that the government’s seizure\nof the entire Tracey directory was reasonable. However, as\nthe majority acknowledges, this court “limited the reach of\nBeusch’s holding to ‘single files and single ledgers, i.e., single\nitems which, though theoretically separable, in fact constitute\none volume or file folder.’ ”\n  9\n    The majority tries to distinguish what the agents did here from what\ntranspired in Tamura by stating that, here, the agents took only a copy of\nthe Tracey Directory and not the master files as was the case in Tamura.\nYet when the countervailing interest is privacy and not merely the disrup-\ntion of business, that interest suffers whether it is copies or originals that\nare seized. The majority also points out that the agents here did not take\nthe whole computer or all of the computers in CDT’s office. This distinc-\ntion fails to recognize the difference between the computer age and the\npaper age. All of the files in one directory on one computer in today’s\nworld could very well constitute the equivalent of all the files in an entire\noffice in yesterday’s paper era.\n\f            UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           19873\n   Here, the government seized the entire Tracey directory,\nnot only the individual spreadsheet containing the Major\nLeague Baseball players’ test results. In Beusch, we specifi-\ncally stated that “[t]he reasons we have given for allowing\ntheir seizure may not apply to sets of ledgers or files . . . .”\n596 F.2d at 877. On many computers, all of a user’s docu-\nments are found in a single directory. To apply Beusch to the\ncomputer context in the way the majority suggests would per-\nmit the government to seize all the documents on a given\ncomputer if only one document therein was responsive to the\nwarrant. This is precisely what Beusch explicitly said it did\nnot intend to permit in the paper documents context.\n\n   The majority’s holding that the government was entitled to\nseize all records in the file because the non-Balco drug test\nresults were “intermingled” in the same file puts Americans’\nmost basic privacy interests in jeopardy. Such a rule would\nentitle the government to seize the medical records of anyone\nwho had the misfortune of visiting a hospital or belonging to\na health care provider that kept patient records in any sort of\nmaster file which also contained the data of a person whose\ninformation was subject to a search warrant. I agree entirely\nwith Judge Illston’s observation that the implications of\napproving such behavior are staggering. Under the majority’s\nholding, no laboratory or hospital or health care facility could\nguarantee the confidentiality of records.\n\n  The majority attempts to discount this possibility, but offers\nno principled reason why it does not apply in hundreds of\nother contexts. Indeed, under questioning from the district\njudges, the government did not discount the possibility of\nother widespread searches.10\n  10\n     For example, a hearing before Magistrate Judge Johnson contained the\nfollowing colloquy between government counsel and the Court:\n       Court:   * * * If there is some other drug testing lab apart\n                from CDT, would you ever use — but the test for the\n                ten were at CDT. Would you ever use this informa-\n\f19874     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   As the Supreme Court has observed, “[i]t is familiar history\nthat indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted under the\nauthority of ‘general warrants’ were the immediate evils that\nmotivated the framing and adoption of the Fourth Amend-\nment.” Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 583 (1980). It was\nfor this reason that the particularity requirement in warrants\nwas adopted. As the Court noted in Maryland v. Garrison,\n480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987):\n\n                 tion to go and say — just demand that you can get the\n                 drug testing results from other labs that test profes-\n                 sional athletes . . . . Based on the theory that it’s sys-\n                 temic. And so there’s a problem, there’s a problem.\n                 And we know that these other labs test athletes, too.\n                 So can you just go search?\n    Counsel:     Yes, your honor.\n   Similarly, in another hearing Judge Illston asked government counsel\nwhether he thought it was possible to take the information from the Tracey\ndirectory concerning other sports organizations and use individual test\nresults of athletes to launch another investigation. Strikingly, Judge Illston\nposed it as a hypothetical, but the government did not appear to deny that\nofficers may have viewed individual records in other sports:\n    Court:       What if hockey had a subdirectory that had positive\n                 results and he clicked on it to make sure it was what\n                 it said it was, by George, that’s what it was, what\n                 about that?\n    Counsel:     I don’t know in checking to make sure it was hockey\n                 that didn’t happen. If it did happen, I would think that\n                 theoretically Agent Novitsky would have the right to\n                 either request a search warrant or, I suppose, if you\n                 looked at it enough, it’s possible that it was obvious,\n                 it was plain view, it was other drug use by hockey\n                 players. So there might be a legal entitlement for\n                 Agent Novitzsky to use that and do something with\n                 it. It hasn’t happened in this case. I suppose that’s\n                 theoretically possible, again, you would have, I\n                 believe, probable cause to believe that evidence in\n                 there would lead to other persons potentially involved\n                 in disputable criminal drugs, which is the crime that’s\n                 under investigation.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        19875\n    The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment cate-\n    gorically prohibits the issuance of any warrant\n    except one “particularly describing the place to be\n    searched and the persons or things to be seized.” The\n    manifest purpose of this particularity requirement\n    was to prevent general searches. By limiting the\n    authorization to search to the specific areas and\n    things for which there is probable cause to search,\n    the requirement ensures that the search will be care-\n    fully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on\n    the character of the wide-ranging exploratory\n    searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\n\n   Unfortunately, the majority’s theory—as well as the\ngovernment’s—causes just this type of result. The more sensi-\nble theory with respect to electronic data is to enforce the pro-\ncedure outlined in Tamura and require that a neutral\nmagistrate examine the co-mingled data that the government\nproposes to seize to make sure that private information that\nthe government is not authorized to see remains private.\nAgents who expect to encounter intermingled data or who\nunexpectedly encounter it may not review the data unabated,\nbut must seek a magistrate’s guidance on how to proceed.\nThis procedure need not impose impossible burdens on law\nenforcement. After seizure, the data is secure and may be\nreviewed in an “informed and deliberate” manner by a “neu-\ntral and detached” magistrate, rather than being secreted for\nindiscriminate examination by government officials.\n\n  Tamura described a procedure that would impose a check\non the government’s ability to engage in such behavior. We\nadvised that where “documents are so intermingled that they\ncannot be feasibly sorted on site,” that law enforcement offi-\ncers should “seal[ ] and hold[ ] the documents pending\napproval by a magistrate . . . .” Id. at 595-96. As we noted:\n\n    The essential safeguard required is that wholesale\n    removal must be monitored by the judgment of a\n\f19876       UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n       neutral, detached magistrate. In the absence of an\n       exercise of such judgment prior to the seizure in the\n       present case, it appears to us that the seizure, even\n       though convenient under the circumstances, was\n       unreasonable.\n\nId. at 596 (footnote omitted).11\n\n   The majority overrules the Tamura procedure, allowing the\ngovernment to search and seize documents without prior mag-\nistrate approval. This holding conflicts with Tamura.\n\n   Therefore, I respectfully disagree with the majority’s asser-\ntion that the government’s action in this case complied with\nthe Fourth Amendment, and that the procedures outlined in\nTamura should be rejected. There is no doubt that the agents\nviolated the terms of the search warrant.\n\n                                      5\n\n   The government did not advocate the position adopted by\nthe majority. The government’s sole justification for the war-\nrantless seizure of the data of the unlisted players is that it was\nin “plain view,” which is one of the limited exceptions to the\nFourth Amendment’s warrant requirement. Although the\nmajority did not reach this question, the theory formed the\nentire basis for the government’s legal justification for its\nactions and was the primary focus of the proceedings before\nthe district courts. Therefore, it is important to address it to\n  11\n   The Tenth Circuit adopted the Tamura approach specifically in the\ncomputer context in Carey, holding that:\n       Where officers come across relevant documents so intermingled\n       with irrelevant documents that they cannot feasibly be sorted at\n       the site, the officers may seal or hold the documents pending\n       approval by a magistrate of the conditions and limitations on a\n       further search through the documents.\n172 F.3d at 1275.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19877\ndemonstrate the soundness of the various decisions by the dis-\ntrict courts.\n\n   The plain view doctrine is based on the assumption that if\nthere is probable cause for the search, and the officer is\nlegally entitled to be at the premises under the Fourth Amend-\nment, seizure of an object in plain view that is contraband or\nevidence of a crime does not involve an invasion of privacy.\nPayton, 445 U.S. at 586-87. The Supreme Court has identified\nseveral conditions that must be satisfied before a plain view\nseizure of an object is upheld: (1) the officer conducting the\nseizure must lawfully arrive at the position from which the\nobject is plainly seen; (2) the object must be in plain view; (3)\nthe object’s incriminating character must be “immediately\napparent,” that is, the officer must have probable cause to\nbelieve the object is contraband or evidence of a crime; and\n(4) the officer must have a lawful right of access to the object\nitself. Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993);\nHorton, 496 U.S. at 136-37; Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730,\n737 (1983).\n\n   Under the circumstances presented by this case, not only is\nit clear that the government had not met its burden of estab-\nlishing that the seizure of the data was justified under the\nplain view doctrine, but it is also clear why the plain view\ndoctrine would be inappropriate to apply in the computer con-\ntext.\n\n                               a\n\n   The fundamental requirement of the plain view doctrine is\nthat the object seized be in “plain view,” that is, “obvious to\nthe senses.” United States v. Sifuentes, 504 F.2d 845, 848 (4th\nCir. 1974). After an extensive colloquy, Judge Illston con-\ncluded that the computer data seized was not in “plain view.”\nNot only is this factual conclusion not clearly erroneous, the\nundisputed record completely supports her conclusion under\nany standard of review.\n\f19878   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   As Judge Illston pointed out, this was not a case in which\nan incriminating photo or similar evidence could be viewed\non a computer screen; rather, at best, it involved scrolling\nthrough thousands of records none of which were immedi-\nately visible. In its application for a search warrant, the gov-\nernment justified removal of data and computer equipment on\nthe basis that:\n\n    The volume of data stored on many computer sys-\n    tems and storage devices will typically be so large\n    that it will be highly impractical to search for data\n    during the execution of the physical search of the\n    premises. A single megabyte of storage space is the\n    equivalent of 500 double-spaced pages of text. A\n    single gigabyte of storage space, or 1,000\n    megabytes, is the equivalent of 500,000 double-\n    spaced pages of text. Storage devices capable of\n    storing fifteen gigabytes of data are now common-\n    place in desktop computers. Consequently, each non-\n    networked desktop computer found during a search\n    can easily contain the equivalent of 7.5 million pages\n    of data, which, if printed out, would completely fill\n    a 10′ x 12′ x 10′ room to the ceiling.\n\n  The government also indicated in its affidavit that it would\nbe using consulting computer specialists to analyze the data.\nThe affidavit explained:\n\n    Searching computer systems is highly technical pro-\n    cess which requires specific expertise and special-\n    ized equipment. There are so many types of\n    computer hardware and software in use today that it\n    is impractical to bring to the search site all of the\n    necessary technical manuals and specialized equip-\n    ment to conduct a thorough search. In addition, it\n    may also be necessary to consult with computer per-\n    sonnel who have specific expertise in the type of\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING      19879\n    computer software application or operating system\n    that is being searched.\n\n   According to the government, the search of the computers\nat CDT could not be completed at the scene. There were, in\nfact, 16 computers. However, one computer was eventually\nisolated and data retrieved. As Special Agent Novitsky’s\nmemorandum of activity stated:\n\n    At approximately 2:35 p.m., S/A Abboud began\n    working on a computer with [a CDT employee].\n    [She] directed us to a computer in the office labeled\n    “E” for purposes of the search warrant and sketch.\n    At this computer, [she] identified a sub-directory\n    entitled “Tracey”, which she said contained all of the\n    computer documents for CDT’s sports drug testing\n    division. A cursory review of the subdirectory indi-\n    cated multiple further subdirectories and several\n    hundred computer files. As authorized by the war-\n    rant, because of the length of time it would take to\n    search each file and the intrusiveness it would cause\n    on CDT, it was decided to make a complete copy of\n    the “Tracey” subdirectory in order to perform a\n    search of it in the IRS-CID offices at a later time.\n\n   Agent Novitsky later explained in a subsequent affidavit\nthat:\n\n    This subdirectory contained hundreds of files and a\n    significant amount of computer data. After consult-\n    ing with agents at the scene specifically trained in\n    the search of computers, we determined that we\n    could not realistically search the entire directory on-\n    site in a reasonable amount of time. We therefore\n    made the determination to copy the entire sub-\n    directory.\n\n  After it was examined, the Tracey directory itself was\ndetermined to contain 2,911 files, with an unknown amount\n\f19880   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nof data in each file, that were not connected with Major\nLeague Baseball player drug testing at all. In the files that\nconcerned Major League Baseball players, there was informa-\ntion on approximately 1,200 players, with multiple test\nresults.\n\n   Given these circumstances, the data seized cannot be con-\nsidered to be in “plain view.” As the Supreme Court has\nnoted, “If, however, the police lack probable cause to believe\nthat an object in plain view is contraband without conducting\nsome further search of the object — i.e., if its incriminating\ncharacter is not immediately apparent, the plain view doctrine\ncannot justify its seizure.” Dickerson, 508 U.S. at 375 (alter-\nations and quotations omitted). The data now sought by the\ngovernment was not “obvious to the senses” at the scene, nor\nwere the positive tests in “plain view” from a glance at a com-\nputer screen. The data required analysis and thorough exami-\nnation off-site before the data at issue was discovered.\n\n   The “plain view” doctrine is inapplicable in the general\nelectronic context because it is at complete odds with the\nunderlying theory of the doctrine. As the Supreme Court has\nexplained:\n\n    The theory of that doctrine consists of extending to\n    nonpublic places such as the home, where searches\n    and seizures without a warrant are presumptively\n    unreasonable, the police’s longstanding authority to\n    make warrantless seizures in public places of such\n    objects as weapons and contraband. And the practi-\n    cal justification for that extension is the desirability\n    of sparing police, whose viewing of the object in the\n    course of a lawful search is as legitimate as it would\n    have been in a public place, the inconvenience and\n    risk—to themselves or to preservation of the\n    evidence—of going to obtain a warrant.\n\nHorton, 480 U.S. at 326-27 (internal citations omitted).\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19881\n   Neither of those considerations is present when we consider\nthe off-site examination of electronic data. As the government\nessentially acknowledged in its search warrant applications,\nexamination of computer data is a forensic exercise. It neces-\nsarily involves the application of software to interpret the\ndata; without external software aid, the data would appear\nonly as binary numbers. In addition, as in this case, the gov-\nernment often requires computer specialists to decipher the\ndata. Electronic data is simply not the kind of evidence that\nforms a natural extension of an officer’s discovery of obvious\ncontraband in a public place. The fact that further careful\nelectronic assistance is required outside the searched premises\nto interpret the data belies the “practical” justification that\nthere is insufficient time to obtain a warrant. Indeed, electron-\nically assisted searches of binary numbers bear a closer\nresemblance to the thermal imaging searches of homes that\nthe Supreme Court rejected as violative of the Fourth Amend-\nment in Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27 (2001).\n\n  The ultimate fact that, after the assistance of electronic soft-\nware programs, the data may be observed “in plain view”\ndoes not alter this conclusion. As the Supreme Court has\nwarned:\n\n    [I]n the vast majority of cases, any evidence seized\n    by the police will be in plain view, at least at the\n    moment of seizure. The problem with the “plain\n    view” doctrine has been to identify the circum-\n    stances in which plain view has legal significance\n    rather than being simply the normal concomitant of\n    any search, legal or illegal.\n\nCoolidge, 403 U.S. at 465.\n\n  The off-site forensic examination of computer data is sim-\nply not one of those circumstances that fits the “plain view”\nparadigm. Indeed, to hold otherwise would be to write out the\nFourth Amendment’s particularity requirement with respect to\n\f19882   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nelectronic data and to transform particularized search warrants\ninto general search warrants, with the government authorized\nto conduct indiscriminate, dragnet searches.\n\n                               b\n\n   The government also failed to sustain its burden to estab-\nlish the plain view exception because, as the district courts\nfound, the incriminating character of the information was not\n“immediately apparent.” It was clear under the testing proto-\ncol that positive tests did not necessarily reflect steroid use;\nthe use of nutritional supplements—which is common in pro-\nfessional sports—could also yield a false positive. In addition,\nthere are a whole host of legitimate reasons for individuals to\nbe prescribed steroid products. The CDT testing was not\nundertaken to test individual players; but rather to provide a\nsurvey for the possible establishment of an individual drug\ntesting protocol.\n\n   What the government relied on was sheer speculation that\nthe presence of positive steroid markers would mean that the\nathlete had received steroids without prescription from some\nunknown person. The crime that the government was inter-\nested in pursuing was the illegal distribution of steroids. The\nevidence of a positive test was not affirmative evidence of any\ndistribution. The government’s theory was that, armed with\nthe test results, the government could then summon the athlete\nbefore a grand jury to see if it could obtain evidence from\nwhom and under what circumstances the athlete may have\nobtained steroids.\n\n   However, the mere suspicion of criminal activity or the sus-\npicion of knowledge of a criminal activity is not sufficient to\nsustain a seizure of evidence under the plain view doctrine.\nAs the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear, the “imme-\ndiately apparent” requirement means that the law enforcement\nofficer must have probable cause to seize the property that the\nofficer observed in plain view. As the Court explained:\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             19883\n     We now hold that probable cause is required. To say\n     otherwise would be to cut the “plain view” doctrine\n     loose from its theoretical and practical moorings. . . .\n     Dispensing with the need for a warrant is worlds\n     apart from permitting a lesser standard of cause for\n     the seizure than a warrant would require, i.e., the\n     standard of probable cause. No reason is apparent\n     why an object should routinely be seizable on lesser\n     grounds, during an unrelated search and seizure, than\n     would have been needed to obtain a warrant for that\n     same object if it had been known to be on the prem-\n     ises.\n\nArizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 326-27 (1987).\n\n   The government conceded that it did not have probable\ncause to search or seize any data or specimens beyond the ten\nplayers listed in the warrant. For those players, the govern-\nment provided extensive information showing their alleged\nconnection to Balco. However, the government conceded that\nit had no information connecting any of the other players to\nBalco. Indeed, it made that clear in both its affidavits and sub-\nsequent hearings. The affidavit provided to Judge Lloyd spec-\nulated that evidence might be developed linking the players\nwho tested positive to Balco “because of the closely-knit pro-\nfessional baseball community,” but also speculated that the\npositive test results could suggest “another significant source\nof illegal performance-enhancing drugs.” In fact, the govern-\nment had no evidence whatsoever that it tendered in support\nof either theory. The government did not have any informa-\ntion concerning who might be involved in any distribution\nscheme; in fact, it had no idea at all.12\n  12\n     For example, the government engaged in the following colloquy at\none hearing:\n    Counsel:   Your honor, it’s evidence because it’s evidence of an\n               illegal distribution of steroids to other people.\n    Court:     From where?\n    Counsel:   From where? That’s an excellent question, and that is\n               why we need the evidence.\n\f19884    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The government did not submit any evidence contradicting\nthe affidavits indicating the possibility of false positives and\nthat a positive result did not necessarily indicate illegal steroid\nuse. There was no specific target of the investigation against\nwhom the government sought incriminating evidence.\n\n   Mere speculation is not sufficient to establish probable\ncause. United States v. Howard, 828 F.2d 552, 555 (9th Cir.\n1987). Perhaps the government had reasonable suspicion, but\nthat is not sufficient to justify a seizure under the plain view\ndoctrine. See Hicks, 480 U.S. at 326 (holding that “probable\ncause is required”); Payton, 445 U.S. at 587 (explaining the\nplain view requirement that there be “probable cause to asso-\nciate the property with criminal activity.”).\n\n                                6\n\n   For all of these reasons, I would hold that the finding that\nthe government acted in callous disregard of the rights of the\nplayers is completely supported by the record. The district\ncourts made no error, much less a clear error, in finding that\nthe first Ramsden factor was satisfied. The district courts\nrightfully rejected the government’s “plain view” justifica-\ntion, and I respectfully disagree with the majority’s new rule\nrejecting the sound procedures described in Tamura.\n\n                                B\n\n   The second Ramsden factor is whether the movant has an\nindividual interest in and the need for the property he wants\nreturned. I agree with the majority and the district courts that\nthe Players Association satisfied this requirement. At issue are\nthe Fourth Amendment rights of the players. As we know, the\nFourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures into areas in which they have a legiti-\nmate expectation of privacy. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S.\n347, 360-61 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring). There is no doubt\nthat the affected baseball players had a justified,\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            19885\nconstitutionally-protected privacy interest in the seized prop-\nerty, including the computer data and the physical urine sam-\nples. However, I believe that the majority significantly\ndiscounts and underestimates the importance of the privacy\ninterests at stake.\n\n   The legitimate expectation of privacy in medical informa-\ntion is as old as the Hippocratic Oath.13 Indeed, “[o]ver the\nlast thirty years, the federal courts have uniformly accepted\nthe principle that medical records are private and entitled to\nprotection.” Joel Glover and Erin Toll, The Right to Privacy\nof Medical Records, 79 Denv. U. L. Rev. 540, 541 (2002). In\nthis context, the Supreme Court has recognized at least two\ndistinct kinds of constitutionally-protected privacy interests:\n“One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of per-\nsonal matters, and another is the interest in independence in\nmaking certain kinds of important decisions.” Doe v. Attorney\nGeneral, 941 F.2d 780, 795 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Whalen\nv. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600 (1977)).\n\n   We have long applied Whalen and its progeny in holding\nthat “[i]ndividuals have a constitutionally protected interest in\navoiding ‘disclosure of personal matters,’ including medical\ninformation.” Tucson Woman’s Clinic v. Eden, 379 F.3d 531,\n551 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence\nBerkeley Laboratory, 135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(“The constitutionally protected privacy interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters clearly encompasses medical\ninformation and its confidentiality.”); Yin v. California, 95\nF.3d 864, 870 (9th Cir. 1996) (noting that “individuals have\na right protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or\nFourteenth Amendments in the privacy of personal medical\ninformation and records.”); Doe, 941 F.2d at 795-96 (holding\n  13\n    STEDMAN’S MEDICAL DICTIONARY, 799 (26th ed. 1995) (“All that may\ncome to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or outside of my\nprofession, or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread\nabroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal.”)\n\f19886        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nthat individual has privacy interest in medical information,\nincluding diagnosis); Caesar v. Mountanos, 542 F.2d 1064,\n1067 n.9 (9th Cir. 1976) (noting that the right to privacy\nencompasses the doctor-patient relationship). As we have\nobserved, “[o]ne can think of few subject areas more personal\nand more likely to implicate privacy interests . . . .” Norman-\nBloodsaw, 135 F.3d at 1269.\n\n  If there were any doubt, the Supreme Court held in Fergu-\nson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 78 (2001), that indi-\nviduals enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy in\nmedical test results and that “the results of those tests will not\nbe shared with nonmedical personnel without [the patient’s]\nconsent.”\n\n   Congress has also recognized the importance of privacy in\nmedical records in a variety of contexts, most prominently in\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of\n1996 (“HIPAA”), Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996).14\n  14\n    HIPAA was far from Congress’s first foray into privacy protection. As\nthe United States Department of Heath and Human Services noted:\n       In the 1970s, individual privacy was paramount in the passage of\n       the Fair Credit Reporting Act (1970), the Privacy Act (1974), the\n       Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (1974), and the Right\n       to Financial Privacy Act (1978). These key laws were followed\n       in the next decade by another series of statutes, including the Pri-\n       vacy Protection Act (1980), the Electronic Communications Pri-\n       vacy Act (1986), the Video Privacy Protection Act (1988), and\n       the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (1988). In the last ten\n       years, Congress and the President have passed additional legal\n       privacy protection through, among others, the Telephone Con-\n       sumer Protection Act (1991), the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act\n       (1994), the Telecommunications Act (1996), the Children’s\n       Online Privacy Protection Act (1998), the Identity Theft and\n       Assumption Deterrence Act (1998), and Title V of the Gramm-\n       Leach-Bliley Act (1999) governing financial privacy.\n         In 1997, a Presidential advisory commission, the Advisory\n       Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19887\nIn the regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA, the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services\nemphasized the importance of maintaining the privacy of\nmedical information, concluding that “[p]rivacy is a funda-\nmental right” and that “[a] right to privacy in personal infor-\nmation has historically found expression in American law.”15\n65 Fed.Reg. at 82,464.\n\n   In sum, given controlling legal authority, there is no ques-\ntion that the baseball players who participated in the random\ntesting had a justified expectation of privacy in the test results\nand, in particular, that the test results would not be disclosed.16\n\n    Care Industry, recognized the need for patient privacy protection\n    in its recommendations for a Consumer Bill of Rights and\n    Responsibilities (November 1997). In 1997, Congress enacted the\n    Balanced Budget Act (Public Law 105-34), which added lan-\n    guage to the Social Security Act (18 U.S.C. 1852) to require\n    Medicare+Choice organizations to establish safeguards for the\n    privacy of individually identifiable patient information. Similarly,\n    the Veterans Benefits section of the U.S. Code provides for confi-\n    dentiality of medical records in cases involving drug abuse, alco-\n    holism or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle cell anemia (38\n    U.S.C. 7332).\nStandards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, 65\nFed.Reg. 82,462, 82,469 (Dec. 28, 2000) (codified at former 45 C.F.R. pts.\n160, 164 (2002)).\n   15\n      The Department also emphasized that “While privacy is one of the\nkey values on which our society is built, it is more than an end in itself.\nIt is also necessary for the effective delivery of health care, both to indi-\nviduals and to populations. . . . The need for privacy of health information,\nin particular, has long been recognized as critical to the delivery of needed\nmedical care.” 65 Fed.Reg. at 82,467.\n   16\n      That the athletes had a justified, reasonable expectation of privacy in\nthe urine samples themselves that were seized by the government is\nbeyond question. See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n, 489\nU.S. 602, 615-617 (1989) (“it is clear that the collection and testing of\nurine intrudes upon expectations of privacy that society has long recog-\nnized as reasonable . . . .”).\n\f19888    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   Of course, under appropriate circumstances, justified pri-\nvacy expectations may be altered by contract. Yin, 95 F.3d at\n872. In this instance, the ballplayers’ privacy expectations\nwere heightened, not diminished, by the collective bargaining\nagreement between the Major League Baseball Players Asso-\nciation and Major League Baseball. The agreement was\nforged after years of impasse concerning steroid testing and,\nas I have discussed, called for anonymous testing to determine\nthe scope of the problem. To that end, the agreement pro-\nvided, in relevant part that:\n\n    1. During the 2003 season (which shall include\n    spring training but not include the post-season), all\n    Players will be subject to two tests (one initial test\n    and one follow-up test conducted not less than five\n    and not more than seven days following the initial\n    test) at unannounced times for the presence of\n    Schedule III steroids (“Survey Testing”). In addition\n    the Office of Commissioner shall have the right to\n    conduct additional Survey Testing in 2003 in which\n    up to 240 players, selected at random, may be tested.\n\n    2. If the results of the Survey Testing conducted in\n    2003 show that more than 5% of Players tested test\n    positive for Steroids, all Players will be subject to\n    two unannounced tests (an initial test and a followup\n    test five to seven days later) for Steroids during the\n    2004 season (“Program Testing”). If a Player tests\n    positive in the Program Testing, he shall immedi-\n    ately be placed on the Clinical Track and shall be\n    subject to discipline for further violations. The Pro-\n    gram Testing shall continue each season until less\n    than 2.5% of the Players tested test positive for Ste-\n    roids for two consecutive seasons combined.\n\n   In short, the only objective of the 2003 testing was to ascer-\ntain whether the threshold had been exceeded; it was not\nintended to test and monitor individual baseball players.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19889\nIndeed, the testing protocol was designed to prevent the iden-\ntification of individual players and the matching of players\nwith test results. The record does not reflect whether any indi-\nvidual player was even informed of his testing results for the\n2003 sample year.\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement contains numerous\nprovisions assuring confidentiality. For example, the section\nconcerning the testing protocol provides:\n\n       The confidentiality of the Player’s participation in\n    the Program is essential to the Program’s success.\n    Except as provided in Section 8, the Office of the\n    Commissioner, the Association, HPAC, Club per-\n    sonnel, and all of their members, affiliates, agents,\n    consultants and employees are prohibited from pub-\n    licly disclosing information about the Player’s test\n    results, Initial Evaluation, diagnosis, Treatment Pro-\n    gram (including whether a Player is on either the\n    Clinical or Administrative Track), prognosis or com-\n    pliance with the Program.\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement specified in great\ndetail the manner of collection of data and, in particular pro-\nvided that:\n\n    At the conclusion of any Survey Test, and after the\n    results of all tests have been calculated, all test\n    results, including any identifying characteristics, will\n    be destroyed in a process jointly supervised by the\n    Office of the Commissioner and the Association.\n\n   The record contains many more references to the assurance\ngiven Major League Baseball players that the 2003 tests\nwould be anonymous and kept confidential, which are unnec-\nessary to detail. There simply is no doubt whatsoever that the\nplayers had a justified, constitutionally protected privacy\ninterest in the test results — an interest that was further\n\f19890    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nenhanced by the many protections and contractual obligations\ncontained in the collective bargaining agreement under which\nthe tests were conducted.\n\n   In sum, the players had a significant privacy interest in the\nmedical records and physical specimens. There is no doubt\nthat the players have an individual interest in and a need for\nthe property to be returned. Thus, the second Ramden factor\nis satisfied.\n\n                               C\n\n   I agree with the majority and the district courts that the\nplayers would be irreparably injured by denying the return of\nproperty. As the majority notes, the government has already\nconceded that the players have no adequate remedy at law for\nthe redress of their grievances. Therefore, the third and fourth\nRamsden factors are satisfied.\n\n   For these reasons, I agree with the majority that the district\ncourts properly exercised equitable jurisdiction. However, I\nwould hold that the district courts correctly found that all four\nRamsden factors were satisfied. I disagree with the majority\nthat the government’s actions properly respected the privacy\nrights of the players.\n\n                               IV\n\n   We review a district court decision to exercise its equitable\njurisdiction under Rule 41(g) under the deferential abuse of\ndiscretion standard. Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 324. I not only fail to\nsee any abuse of discretion in the decisions by the district\njudges to exercise their equitable jurisdiction, I agree entirely\nwith the district courts that the seized property should be\nreturned.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19891\n                                     A\n\n   The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1989 amendments to\nRule 41(g) tell us that “reasonableness under all of the cir-\ncumstances” should be the governing standard for determin-\ning whether property should be returned. (emphasis added).\nThose same notes state that “[i]f the United States has a need\nfor the property in an investigation or prosecution, its reten-\ntion of the property generally is reasonable,” but that “in cer-\ntain circumstances . . . equitable considerations might justify\nrequiring the government to return or destroy all copies.” Id.17\n\n   Deciding between the two hinges on “whether the Govern-\nment’s conduct was sufficiently reprehensible in this case to\nwarrant this sanction.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 327. As the actions\nI have discussed make clear, the government’s behavior was\nsufficiently reprehensible and the privacy interests of the\nplayers who were neither named in the warrant nor implicated\nin any criminal activity sufficiently important to affirm the\ngranting of the 41(g) motions. Simply put, there is no reason\nfor the government to retain confidential medical information\nand bodily fluids of citizens who are not under any particular-\nized suspicion of criminal activity.\n\n                                     B\n\n   I have already detailed my disagreement with the majori-\nty’s evisceration of the Tamura procedure. In addition to that,\nI strongly disagree with the new procedure adopted by the\nmajority to supplant Tamura. The majority proposes that the\n  17\n     The cases the majority cites for the proposition that return of property\nis inappropriate when the government still needs it as evidence are hardly\nanalogous to the present case. In both United States v. Mills, 991 F.2d 609,\n612-13 (9th Cir. 1993), and United States v. Fitzen, 80 F.3d 387, 388-89\n(9th Cir. 1996), the person seeking return of the property was the criminal\ndefendant himself, not an innocent third party, and the court found in both\ncases that the defendants didn’t even have a legitimate claim of ownership\nto the property.\n\f19892   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ngovernment may seize all computer databases containing\nintermingled evidence, and if an objection is raised, must then\nturn the material over to a magistrate judge for review. Under\nthe majority’s new rule, the magistrate judge is to allow the\ngovernment to retain the data if it is not feasible to segregate\nmaterial responsive to the warrant without altering the origi-\nnal character of the information.\n\n                               1\n\n  The majority’s remedy violates the “neutral and detached\nmagistrate” requirement. As the Supreme Court observed\nmany decades ago:\n\n    The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is\n    not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies\n    law enforcement the support of the usual inferences\n    which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its pro-\n    tection consists in requiring that those inferences be\n    drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead\n    of being judged by the officer engaged in the often\n    competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\n\nJohnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13 (1948).\n\n   The protections of requiring a “neutral and detached magis-\ntrate” to make “informed and deliberate determinations” con-\ncerning probable cause are lost when the magistrate’s review\ncomes after the material has been seized and searched. As the\nSupreme Court explained in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108\n(1964):\n\n    The reasons for [the neutral and detached magistrate]\n    rule go to the foundations of the Fourth Amendment.\n    A contrary rule “that evidence sufficient to support\n    a magistrate’s disinterested determination to issue a\n    search warrant will justify the officers in making a\n    search without a warrant would reduce the Amend-\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         19893\n       ment to a nullity and leave the people’s homes\n       secure only in the discretion of police officers.”\n\nId. at 111 (quoting Johnson, 333 U.S. at 14).\n\n   For a magistrate’s role to be effective, it must come before\nthe privacy interests have been compromised. Under the\nmajority’s holding, the government is newly empowered to\nsearch the data before the magistrate authorizes the search.\nThis flips the traditional relationship of the magistrate to the\nsearching officer on its head. In all other contexts, the magis-\ntrate stands between the government and the privacy of indi-\nviduals; in the majority’s proposed world, the magistrate only\nappears after the privacy interests have been invaded.\n\n   Worse, under the majority’s holding, the seized material is\nnot presented to a magistrate at all except upon a “proper\npost-seizure motion by the aggrieved parties.” In other words,\nif no motion is made, there is never an “informed and deliber-\nate” examination of probable cause by a “neutral and\ndetached magistrate.” The government simply keeps and\nsearches the confidential data it seized without any suspicion\nof criminal activity. But how precisely is an honest citizen to\nknow if his or her confidential medical records have been\nseized by the government so that he or she may seek redress?\nThe search warrant is not directed to the innocent party; it is\nserved on the data repository. In the case at bar, the parties\nknew of the seizure of data pursuant to the search warrant\nbecause they were litigating (or at least thought they were liti-\ngating) the production of the material pursuant to a grand jury\nsubpoena. However, at least until this opinion has been\nissued, no one in the National Hockey League knew that the\ngovernment had seized medical records pertaining to its play-\ners without a warrant. Indeed, in the normal case, when a\nsearch warrant is directed to a third party, the innocent citizen\nwhose privacy interests are at stake will have no notice what-\nsoever that his privacy interests have been compromised.18\n  18\n    This problem is one of the reasons why the use of search warrants\nagainst third parties is strongly discouraged.\n\f19894    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nWithout notice, the “aggrieved party” will have no opportu-\nnity to make a “proper post-seizure motion” to have the mate-\nrial reviewed by the magistrate. The oddity of the majority’s\nholding is readily apparent: those suspected of crime or\ninvolved in some manner in the underlying criminal investiga-\ntion will learn of the seizure and can take steps to protect their\nFourth Amendment rights. However, the completely innocent\ncitizen with no involvement in the underlying investigation\nwhose data has been seized will not have notice or any oppor-\ntunity to protest. It is quite difficult to understand how this\nprocedure protects the right of law-abiding citizens “to be\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\nunreasonable searches and seizures.”\n\n   Even if, as in this case, a representative of the innocent “ag-\ngrieved party” had sufficient notice of the seizure, the inno-\ncent citizen is now required under the majority holding to hire\nan attorney and make a “proper post-seizure motion” to\nrequire the government do to what the Fourth Amendment\nrequired it to do in the first instance: establish before a neutral\nand detached magistrate that probable cause exists to seize\nand search the property.\n\n  In sum, under the majority’s holding, the eversion of the\nFourth Amendment is thus rendered complete. The govern-\nment is entitled to warrantless searches and seizures without\nprobable cause or particularized suspicion, and the honest citi-\nzen bears the cost and the burden of showing that the govern-\nment should have demonstrated probable cause before seizing\nand searching the law-abiding citizen’s personal property.\n\n                                2\n\n   The majority’s holding unfortunately does not stop with\nrequiring citizens to force the government to establish proba-\nble cause. Under the majority holding, even if a neutral and\ndetached magistrate concludes after an informed and deliber-\nate examination of the data that the government has not estab-\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             19895\nlished probable cause, the magistrate is not directed to limit\nthe seizure. To the contrary, if the magistrate determines that\nconfidential data cannot be separated, or cannot be separated\n“without creating new documents,” or that the unrelated con-\nfidential information cannot be excised “without distorting the\ncharacter of the original document,” then the government is\nentitled to keep the unrelated confidential data without show-\ning probable cause or reasonable suspicion. In the age of elec-\ntronic data, this holding virtually eliminates Fourth\nAmendment protections for confidential data. The usual prac-\ntice is to err on the side of redaction for the protection of\nthose whose privacy interests may be unnecessarily jeopar-\ndized. Unfortunately, the majority tilts the balance in the\nopposite direction, encouraging magistrates to allow the gov-\nernment to retain all unrelated data if the original data is co-\nmingled in some fashion.\n\n   Placing restrictions on magistrate’s ability to redact infor-\nmation and allowing the government to retain whole data-\nbases of confidential electronic information on the theory that\nsome data relevant to the warrant is “co-mingled” defies com-\nmon sense and the realities of electronic data storage. One of\nthe chief advantages of electronic data storage is that it allows\nlarge volumes of information to be retained in a very small\nspace, such as a computer hard drive. Another advantage of\nelectronic data storage is the ease of searching and examining\ndata. A relational database, such as the one at issue in this\ncase, is one in which the database is organized and accessed\naccording to the relationships between data items without the\nneed for any consideration of physical orientation and rela-\ntionship. Software programs allow the examination and corre-\nlation of information. A relational database provides the\nperfect vehicle for segregating non-relevant information. For\nexample, in this case, a simple search would have yielded the\ninformation responsive to the search warrant.19 However, an\n  19\n    The majority suggests that I would place the searching agents under\na duty to rely on CDT to guide their search, but I suggest no such thing.\n\f19896     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ninherent feature of a relational database is that data is “co-\nmingled.” Instead of using the power of a relational database\nto protect legitimate privacy interests, the majority would\nadopt a rule discouraging—if not precluding—such a use.\nUnder the majority’s approach, the government would be\nentitled to retain all electronic information if “co-mingled.”\nGiven that “co-mingling” is an inherent aspect of electronic\ndatabases, this restriction renders the Fourth Amendment a\nnullity in the electronic context.\n\n   The logic is circulate and the result completely predictable.\nThe government is entitled to seize property without a warrant\nonly if it is “co-mingled” and cannot be segregated. Then, if\na party objects the seizure, the data must be presented to a\nmagistrate judge who must release it back to the government\nintact if the magistrate judge determines that the irrelevant\ndata is “co-mingled” and cannot be segregated. The exercise\nis purely illusory and can only lead to an intellectual cul-de-\nsac. The Fourth Amendment’s probable cause requirement is\nneatly and entirely eliminated.\n\n  The majority not only countenances this procedure, but\nencourages it. I cannot agree. In the electronic age, magistrate\njudges should be required to use all available tools—software\nas well as black marker—to redact confidential information\nnot responsive to a warrant in order to protect the privacy of\ninnocent citizens who are not suspected of any crime.\n\n                                     3\n\n  The profound consequences of the majority rule are readily\ndemonstrated by the case at bar. Because they had no notice\n\nWhen data searching functions are available, as they were here, agents or\ntheir consultants are perfectly capable of conducting key word searches\nthemselves, with or without any information from the party being\nsearched. Here, CDT—a third party entity not suspected of any crime—\noffered to segregate the data utilizing the functions of the program. A fur-\nther, and much better alternative, would be to transfer the data to a magis-\ntrate judge for segregation and management.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING     19897\nof the governments’s seizure, no objections were filed by the\nthirteen other major sports organizations, three unaffiliated\nbusiness entities, and three sports competitions whose data\nwas seized. Therefore, a magistrate will never review that\nunauthorized seizure under the majority holding. Under the\nmajority’s rule, the government will also be allowed to retain\nall of the information it seized from those who did object\nbecause the information is co-mingled and cannot be segre-\ngated without changing its original character.\n\n   There is no need to reinvent the wheel. The Tamura proce-\ndure has been part of our court’s precedent for almost a quar-\nter of a century. Tamura provides a practical and sensible\nmethod by which the government may obtain data to which\nit is rightfully entitled without violating the constitutional\nrights of honest citizens. We should reaffirm Tamura, not\nsupplant it.\n\n                              V\n\n   For similar reasons, I would also affirm Judge Illston’s\ndecision to quash the May 6, 2004, subpoenas. The majority\ncontends that Judge Illston abused her discretion by resting\nher decision to quash the subpoenas on legally insufficient\ngrounds, citing In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated Dec. 10,\n1987, 926 F.2d 847 (9th Cir. 1991), for the proposition that\nsubpoenas and search warrants serve different purposes and\ntherefore arguing that it cannot be considered an abuse to use\nboth methods of obtaining information. However, in this case,\nthe government’s conduct went beyond seeking warrants and\nsubpoenas for the same information at the same time. As dis-\ncussed previously, the government alternately sought subpoe-\nnas and warrants to obtain highly sensitive information from\nevery Major League Baseball player and to continue to keep\nthat information after being ordered to return it. Further, as\npreviously noted, there were no substantiated risks justifying\nthe use of a warrant to obtain the documentary evidence from\na third party under 28 C.F.R. § 59.1(b).\n\f19898   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   In addition, it is worth nothing that the May 6 subpoenas\nrequested much of the same information sought in the April\n30 and prior search warrants. The affidavit to obtain the April\n30 search warrant from Judge Lloyd averred that the material\nwas necessary in part because the records may “establish a\nlink to the charged defendants in this case.” It is an abuse of\nthe grand jury process to use grand jury subpoenas to develop\npost-indictment trial material. See, e.g., In Re Grand Jury\nSubpoena Duces Tecum Dated January 2, 1985 (Simels), 767\nF.2d 26, 29 (2d Cir.1985) (timing of subpoena, first issued\nafter indictment, suggested that its purpose was to obtain trial\nmaterial). The Balco indictments were returned in February.\nTherefore, the issuance of the May 6 grand jury subpoena,\nfollowing on the heels of the search warrant application for\nthe same information indicating that its partial purpose was to\ndevelop links to Balco, suggests an abuse of grand jury pro-\ncess.\n\n   Given the history of this case, the district court’s conclu-\nsion that the filing of these subpoenas was “the culmination\nof a series of actions taken by the government in order to pre-\nvent the MLBPA and CDT’s attempt to move to quash the\nJanuary and March subpoenas” is fully supported by the\nrecord and certainly cannot be said to be an abuse of discre-\ntion.\n\n                              VI\n\n   I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the media has\nstanding on appeal to file a motion to unseal records. I also\nagree that, under the circumstances presented by this case, the\nmotion should be referred to the district courts on remand.\n\n   I write separately to comment on what I view as a regretta-\nble effort by both parties in the district courts to circumvent\nthe procedures we have established to balance the First\nAmendment rights of the press with the confidentiality that is\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          19899\nrequired for some criminal proceedings.20 Specifically, I note\nthat all of the district court proceedings were closed by insis-\ntence of the parties, without notice to the press or public.\n\n   In some instances, courtroom closures were obtained with-\nout prior notice to the district court itself. For example, the\ntranscript of one of the hearings before one of the district\ncourt judges reflects the following colloquy:\n\n       Court:    Why is that, that you are locking the door?\n\n       Clerk:    Since the case was filed under seal.\n\n       Court:    Is this all under seal? * * * You want the\n                 hearings under seal. There was no motion\n                 made to seal the hearing. I wasn’t aware\n                 you wanted it that way.\n\n       Counsel: Your honor, we filed the pleadings under\n                seal. We think this proceeding should be\n                under seal. The information at issue is\n                highly confidential.\n\n   After some colloquy, the court allowed the courtroom to be\nsealed, but admonished counsel to file an appropriate motion\nif they wished any further courtroom proceedings to be closed\nin the future. However, neither the public nor the press were\nnotified that the doors were to be locked and the public\nbarred.\n\n  “Under the first amendment, the press and the public have\na presumed right of access to court proceedings and docu-\nments.” Oregonian Pub. Co. v. District Court, 920 F.2d 1462,\n1465 (9th Cir. 1990) (citing Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior\n  20\n    The government and the Players Association also sought to have oral\nargument in the court of appeals closed to the public. We denied that\nmotion, and a subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n\f19900    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nCourt, 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1985)(“Press-Enterprise I”). “This\npresumed right can be overcome only by an overriding right\nor interest ‘based on findings that closure is essential to pre-\nserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that\ninterest.’ ” Id. (quoting Press-Enterprise I, 464 U.S. at 510)\n\n   In determining questions of public and press access to the\ncourts, courts are to examine whether a right attaches to a par-\nticular proceeding, using the Supreme Court’s “logic and\nexperience” test articulated in Press-Enterprise v. Superior\nCourt of California for the County of Riverside, 478 U.S. 1,\n8-9 (1986) (“Press-Enterprise II”). “If a proceeding fulfills\nboth parts of the test, a qualified First Amendment right of\naccess arises, to be overcome ‘only by an overriding interest\nbased on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher\nvalues and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.’ ” Phoe-\nnix Newspapers, Inc. v. District Court, 156 F.3d 940, 946 (9th\nCir. 1998) (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9-10).\nProvisions for narrow tailoring may include later release of\ntranscripts, or redacted transcripts. Id. at 947.21 In making its\ndecision to close proceedings, “[t]he trial court must articulate\nthis interest ‘along with findings specific enough that a\nreviewing court can determine whether the closure order was\nproperly entered.’ ” Id. at 946-47. None of these procedural\nsteps were undertaken in the district courts.\n\n   To be sure, the right of access to court proceedings is not\nabsolute. Id. at 946. Both parties have legitimate privacy\ninterests to protect. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nrequire “matters affecting a grand jury proceeding to be\nclosed to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters\noccurring before a grand jury.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(5). In\naddition, as I have discussed, the athletes represented by the\nPlayers Association have a very strong privacy interest in\ntheir medical records. However, there are non-grand jury\n  21\n    Indeed, transcripts of court proceedings “must be released when the\nfactors militating in favor of closure no longer exist.” Id. at 947-48.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               19901\nmaterials involved in this case, and there are some proceed-\nings that do not appear to have involved confidential material.22\n\n   In any case, these are matters best considered in the first\ninstance by the district court, with public notice so that the\nFirst Amendment right of access may be balanced with the\nprivacy interests of the parties. Unfortunately, the parties\npresented hearing closure and record sealing as a fait accom-\npli to the district courts, without notice to the press or public.\nNow that we have remanded the motion to unseal, this issue\nmay be addressed.\n\n                                   VII\n\n   In discussions of the alleged use of steroids by baseball\nplayers, much is made about “the integrity of the game.” Even\nmore important is the integrity of our legal system. Perhaps\nbaseball has become consumed by a “Game of Shadows,”23\nbut that is no reason for the government to engage in a “Pros-\necution of Shadows.” The district judges were entirely right\nto order the government to return the thousands of private\nmedical records it wrongfully seized by use of pretext and\nartifice.\n\n   I would affirm the orders of the district court and must\nrespectfully dissent from the majority’s contrary conclusion.\nI concur in the remand of the motion to unseal records.\n  22\n      The government, in at least one proceeding, seemed to indicate that\nit might not oppose unsealing some material, with government counsel\nstating before Judge Mahan: “As a matter of DOJ regulation and policy,\nwe actually have taken the position and we do take the position that there\nisn’t a need to have these proceedings actually sealed, and that is because\nof the paramount interest in having actual public proceedings in court-\nrooms held in public.” However, the government did not object formally\nto sealing the transcript of that hearing, and the transcript has, to date,\nbeen sealed.\n   23\n      Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, Game of Shadows (2006).\n\f",

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                              OPINION\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:\n\n  We must decide whether the United States may retain evi-\ndence it seized from Major League Baseball’s drug testing\nadministrator (and enforce an additional subpoena) as part of\nan ongoing grand jury investigation into illegal steroid use by\nprofessional athletes.\n\n                                    I\n\n   These three consolidated cases arise from the federal inves-\ntigation of the Bay Area Lab Cooperative (“Balco”) and its\nalleged distribution of illegal steroids to professional baseball\nathletes. The investigation began in August 2002 and, over\nthe following several years, produced evidence—including\ngrand jury testimony—establishing probable cause to believe\nthat at least ten major league baseball players received illegal\nsteroids from Balco. Today we decide the government’s\nappeals from the separate adverse orders of three different\ndistrict courts: (1) an order by Judge Florence-Marie Cooper\nin the Central District of California, requiring the government\nto return property seized from Comprehensive Drug Testing,\nInc. in Long Beach, California (“CDT”),1 (2) an order by\nJudge James Mahan in the District of Nevada, requiring the\ngovernment to return property seized from Quest Diagnostics,\nInc. in Las Vegas, Nevada (“Quest”),2 and (3) an order by\nJudge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California,\nquashing the government’s May 6, 2004, subpoenas to CDT\nand Quest that related to the grand jury sitting in San Fran-\ncisco, California.\n  1\n    The courts also required the government to turn over all notes made by\nagents who reviewed the challenged evidence.\n  2\n    Again, the government was also required to give up all notes made by\nreviewing agents.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 19791\n                                     A\n\n   As part of its investigation into Balco, the government in\nNovember 2003 served a grand jury subpoena on Major\nLeague Baseball (“MLB”),3 seeking drug testing information\nfor eleven players4 with connections to Balco. One month\nlater, MLB responded that it had no such information.\n\n   The government then reasoned that because CDT5 and Quest6\nhad tested urine samples from MLB players during 2003,\nthose entities—rather than MLB—had to possess the samples\nand testing records in question. Therefore, the government\nissued subpoenas both to CDT and to Quest, seeking drug\ntesting information for all MLB players. The subpoenas were\nreturnable on February 5, 2004, but the government extended\nthat date to March 4, 2004, after CDT and Quest promised not\nto destroy or to alter any of the evidence requested.\n\n   Despite protracted negotiations, CDT and Quest resisted\nproducing any of the subpoenaed materials, explaining that\nthey would fight production of even a single drug test all the\n  3\n     “Major League Baseball,” an unincorporated association, consists of\ntwo professional baseball leagues—the National League of Professional\nBaseball Clubs and the American League of Professional Baseball Clubs.\n   4\n     The names of the players are under seal and are not disclosed in this\nopinion.\n   5\n     CDT is a third-party administrator of “drug and alcohol testing pro-\ngrams” that was hired to oversee MLB’s drug use evaluation program. The\ncompany includes “top experts in pharmacology, forensic toxicology, lab-\noratory management, medical review, legal, and administrative compli-\nance.” See Comprehensive Drug Testing: About Us, http://\nwww.cdtsolutions.com/about_us.html (last visited Nov. 10, 2006).\n   6\n     Quest offers laboratories that conduct “drugs of abuse testing and ther-\napeutic drug monitoring” with “the most advanced methodologies avail-\nable.” See Quest Diagnostics: Diagnostic Testing & Services, http://\nwww.questdiagnostics.com/brand/business/b_bus_lab_index.html             (last\nvisited Nov. 10, 2006). Quest’s laboratory in Las Vegas performed the\ndrug testing on the player specimens at issue in these consolidated appeals.\n\f19792     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nway to the Supreme Court. Following further negotiations, the\ngovernment, believing that a narrower subpoena might be\neffective, issued new subpoenas on March 3, 2004, seeking\ndocuments related only to eleven7 players with Balco connec-\ntions. These new subpoenas were returnable on April 8, 2004.\n\n   Two days before the new return date, the Major League\nBaseball Players’ Association—the union representing ath-\nletes who play for Major League Baseball8 —informed the\ngovernment that it intended to file a motion to quash the sub-\npoenas. The following day, as promised, CDT and the Play-\ners’ Association filed such a motion in the Northern District\nof California before United States District Judge Jeffrey\nWhite.\n\n                                     B\n\n   After learning of the planned motion to quash, the govern-\nment applied on April 7 and April 8, 2004, for warrants to\nsearch CDT’s Long Beach office and Quest’s Las Vegas labo-\nratory. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Johnson issued a search war-\nrant for the office in his jurisdiction, the Central District of\nCalifornia, and Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leavitt issued a\nsearch warrant for the laboratory in his jurisdiction, the Dis-\ntrict of Nevada.9 Affidavits submitted to support the warrants\nnoted that the information sought was already the subject of\n  7\n     The government later decided not to seek drug testing evidence related\nto one of the eleven players, and on April 22, 2004, sent a letter to the\ncounsel for CDT withdrawing requests for documents related to that\nplayer.\n   8\n     The testing records at issue in these cases were created pursuant to a\ncollective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the\nplayers of Major League Baseball (represented by the Major League Base-\nball Players’ Association).\n   9\n     The pursuit of search warrants in different districts was proper under\nthe applicable federal rule, which gives a magistrate judge the authority\n“to issue a warrant to search for and seize a person or property located\nwithin the district,” “to issue a warrant for a person or property outside the\ndistrict if the person or property is located within the district when the\nwarrant is issued but might move or be moved outside the district before\nthe warrant is executed,” or “in an investigation of domestic terrorism or\ninternational terrorism . . . [to] issue a warrant for a person or property\nwithin or outside that district.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b).\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19793\ngrand jury subpoenas and that a motion to quash was expected.10\nContrary to appellee’s arguments, the government never\nclaimed in its affidavits that any evidence was in danger of\nbeing destroyed.11\n\n   The April 7 and April 8 warrants authorized the seizure of\ndrug test records and specimens for ten named Balco-\nconnected players, as well as “[a]ll manuals, pamphlets, book-\nlets, contracts, agreements and any other materials detailing or\nexplaining” CDT’s or Quest’s “administration of Major\nLeague Baseball’s drug testing program.”12 The warrants also\nauthorized the search of computer equipment, computer stor-\nage devices, and—where an on-site search would be\nimpracticable—seizure of either a copy of all data or the com-\nputer equipment itself. “[L]aw enforcement personnel trained\nin searching and seizing computer data” (designated “com-\nputer personnel”) were responsible for choosing the appropri-\nate course of action to capture the electronic data sought. If\nseizure of all data or equipment was necessary, “appropriately\ntrained personnel” would review the data, retaining the evi-\ndence authorized by the warrant and designating the remain-\nder for return.\n\n   On the morning of April 8, 2004, Special Agent Jeff\nNovitzky (the lead case agent) and eleven other federal agents\n—including Computer Investigative Specialist Agent Joseph\nAbboud—executed the search warrant for CDT’s Long Beach\noffice. Although CDT personnel were initially cooperative,\n   10\n      The affidavit for the search warrant in the District of Nevada advised\nthe court that Quest “intend[ed] to move to quash the subpoena.” Later,\nthat language was crossed out and replaced with a handwritten note: “A\nmotion to quash has been filed. 4.7.04,” followed by Judge Leavitt’s ini-\ntials.\n   11\n      See infra Section III.A.2.\n   12\n      The April 8 warrant also expressly authorized the seizure of “corre-\nspondence” and “e-mails” detailing or explaining Quest’s administration\nof the drug testing program.\n\f19794     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\none of CDT’s directors—after speaking with counsel—\ninformed Agent Novitzky that CDT would not assist federal\nofficers in locating the evidence they were authorized to seize\nand that the agents should “do what they needed to do.” When\ninformed that agents might be forced to seize all computer\nequipment for up to sixty days, the director again contacted\ncounsel, exclaiming that such a seizure would “shut[ ] the\nbusiness down.”\n\n   Throughout the morning and early afternoon, Agent\nNovitzky spoke several times with CDT’s attorney, David\nBancroft. Bancroft asked Agent Novitzky not to seize any-\nthing while he attempted to work out a beneficial solution\nwith the United States Attorney’s Office in San Francisco.\nLater, Bancroft told the agent that CDT had only one hard-\ncopy document eligible for seizure. Around noon, both Agent\nNovitzky and Assistant United States Attorney Jeff Nedrow\nspoke with Bancroft and CDT’s directors via conference call.\nBancroft emphasized that any help CDT provided should not\nbe construed to constitute consent and then informed Nedrow\nand Agent Novitzky that CDT had two computers on which\nagents would find information relevant to the search warrant.\n\n   During this conference call, Agent Novitzky learned that\nagents had discovered a hard-copy document with names and\nidentifying numbers for all MLB players, including some of\nthe ten named Balco players. Agent Novitzky faxed the docu-\nment, which was not the “only document eligible for seizure”\nto which Bancroft had alluded, to Nedrow for preparation of\nanother search warrant to seize specimen samples from Quest\nbased on the identifying numbers.13 One of CDT’s directors\n  13\n     A separate group of federal agents had simultaneously executed a sep-\narate search warrant at Quest’s Las Vegas laboratory, but they were unable\nto locate the specimens to be seized, because the specimens were identi-\nfied by number only. Agents used the master list from CDT to apply for\na third search warrant. The new warrant for Quest was authorized by\nJudge Leavitt in the District of Nevada at 6 p.m. that evening, and agents\nseized the then-identifiable Balco players’ specimens later that same night.\nThis opinion focuses on the search of CDT, because the motions for return\nof property were premised on the government’s conduct during that\nsearch.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             19795\nbecame visibly upset when she noticed the document being\nfaxed. She left the premises, but when she returned, she\nopened a locked drawer and presented agents with a docu-\nment that contained drug testing results for the ten named\nBalco players—the document previously described as the\nonly seizable hard-copy document on site.14\n\n   At 2:35 p.m., a CDT director finally identified a computer\ndirectory containing all of the computer files for CDT’s sports\ndrug testing programs. This directory, labeled by its original\ncompiler as the “Tracey” directory, contained numerous sub-\ndirectories and hundreds of files. Seeing this, Agent Abboud\nrecommended copying the entire directory for off-site analy-\nsis, because of the time and intrusiveness involved in search-\ning the voluminous directory on site. Knowing that the\nwarrant required them to rely upon the advice of a computer\nanalyst—here the advice of Computer Investigative Specialist\nAgent Joseph Abboud—agents copied the directory and\nremoved the copy for later review at government offices.\n\n   The search of the CDT facility concluded shortly after 5\np.m., but before he left the premises, Agent Novitzky\nreviewed with CDT directors the evidence seized during the\nsearch. The documents seized included a twenty-five-page\nmaster list of all MLB players tested during the 2003 season\nand a thirty-four-page list of positive drug testing results for\neight of the ten named Balco players, intermingled with posi-\ntive results for twenty-six other players.15\n  14\n    Some time later, agents located a billing document for CDT’s off-site\nLong Beach storage locker. After agents obtained a fourth warrant, which\nallowed them to search and seize evidence in the locker, a CDT director\nagreed to open the compartment for the agents.\n  15\n   Copies of all seized documents were provided to CDT by the govern-\nment on April 16, 2004.\n\f19796     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                     C\n\n   Upon returning to his office in San Jose, California, Agent\nNovitzky briefly reviewed the contents of the Tracey direc-\ntory, identifying five subdirectories related to MLB. Within\nthese directories, Agent Novitzky identified files authorized\nby magistrate judges for seizure, including the master file of\npositive drug test results.16 On April 26, 2004, the Players’\n  16\n     On April 30, the government applied for a fifth search warrant in the\nNorthern District of California, asking for authorization to “seize” all elec-\ntronic data “regarding drug specimens, drug testing, specimen identifica-\ntion numbers, athlete identification numbers, and drug test results, retained\nby [CDT] . . . pertaining to the drug testing of Major League Baseball\nplayers, located within the copy of a CDT computer sub-directory cur-\nrently in the possession of the [Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)] in San\nJose, California, identified as the ‘Tracey’ sub-directory, bearing the fol-\nlowing computer file group names: (1) ‘MAJOR LEAGUE GROUP’ (2)\n‘MLB BILLING’ (3) ‘MLB Drug SubCommittee’ (4) ‘MLB Follow UP’\n(5) ‘MLB IOC.’ ” Because this copy of the Tracey directory was in the\nhands of the IRS in San Jose, in the Northern District of California, the\ngovernment sought the search warrant in that district. Magistrate Judge\nHoward Lloyd approved the warrant. The government did not notify CDT,\npresumably because the IRS already had in its possession the copy of the\nentire directory containing the relevant materials.\n   The Players’ Association subsequently filed a Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g)\nmotion in the Northern District of California seeking return of any prop-\nerty taken pursuant to the April 30 search warrant, and on August 9, 2004,\nJudge Illston granted this motion. The government did not appeal the order\nand does not dispute it now. Instead, the government asserts that it retains\nthe right to review the Tracey directory based upon the April 7 search war-\nrants, a contention we address in this consolidated appeal.\n   Insofar as the dissent suggests that the pursuit of the April 30 search\nwarrant evidences bad faith harassment by the government and an attempt\nto evade a possibly adverse order on the motion for return of property filed\nin the Central District of California, we decline to speculate. We have no\nreason to believe that the government sought the April 30 warrant for pur-\nposes of harassment, rather than to avoid an additional search of CDT that\nwould have followed from authorization to seize the original copy in the\nCentral District. Since no district court has ever held an evidentiary hear-\ning, and the government complied with the commands of the criminal\nrules to secure search warrants from the magistrate judges in whose dis-\ntricts the property was located, based upon a showing of probable cause\nthat incriminating evidence would be found, we see no signs of bad faith\nto support the district courts’ contrary conclusion.\n\f          UNITED STATES v.

Mag-\nistrate Judge Leavitt in the District of Nevada authorized sei-\nzure of the specimens from Quest, and Magistrate Judge\nRosalyn M. Chapman in the Central District of California\nauthorized the seizure of records from CDT. Again, the gov-\nernment sought and obtained each warrant from the district\ncourt whose jurisdiction encompassed the situs of the property\nto be searched, as directed by Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b).18 The\ngovernment executed the warrants on May 6, and the Players’\nAssociation immediately filed Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) motions\nseeking return of the specimens and records seized.\n\n   On August 19, 2004, Judge Mahan granted the Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 41(g) motion brought by the Players’ Association in\nthe District of Nevada and ordered the government to return\nall specimens seized from Quest and all notes and memoranda\ncompiled by agents who reviewed the evidence, other than\nthose pertaining to the ten Balco players named in the original\nsearch warrant.19 He made findings—without conducting an\n  17\n    Fed.

The motion must be filed in\n      the district where the property was seized. The court must receive\n      evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If\n      it grants the motion, the court must return the property to the\n      movant, but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access\n      to the property and its use in later proceedings.\n   18\n      See supra note 9.\n   19\n      The government moved for a stay of this order because the evidence\nwas otherwise lawfully in its possession pursuant to the subpoena of May\n6, 2004.

See infra note 39.\n   21\n      These subpoenas were not the earliest ones issued in the investigation.\nThe first subpoenas dated to January 16, 2004, and mandated the provision\nof all MLB drug testing records. On March 3, 2004, the government\nobtained narrower subpoenas for eleven Balco-connected players.\n   On April 22, 2004, the government sent a letter to CDT withdrawing the\nJanuary 2004 subpoenas. In the same letter, the government reduced the\nMarch 3, 2004, subpoenas to ten, not eleven, Balco players. At the time\nthe government obtained the May 6 subpoenas, the only outstanding sub-\npoenas were those of March 3, which sought the records of ten players\nwith Balco connections.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19799\nalso pursued in the government’s May 5 search warrants. The\ngovernment sought these later search warrants and subpoenas\non the ground that the April 8 seizures did not provide all\ninformation needed for the investigation.22\n\n   Quest complied with the May 6 subpoena, providing the\ngovernment with hundreds of pages of documents, but the\ngovernment agreed to defer CDT’s compliance pending reso-\nlution of the search warrant litigation. On August 31, 2004,\nhowever, the government revoked the indefinite deferral and\ninstructed CDT to comply with the subpoena by September\n14, 2004. The Players’ Association filed a motion to quash the\nsubpoenas on September 13, 2004.\n\n   In December 2004, after Judge Illston heard argument on\nthe motion but took no testimony, she found that the govern-\nment’s conduct was unreasonable and constituted harassment.\nShe then filed an order quashing the subpoenas, which the\ngovernment timely appealed.\n\n                                    II\n\n  Before we review the orders granting the Fed. R. Crim. P.\n41(g) motions in the Central District of California and the\nDistrict of Nevada, we must decide two jurisdictional issues:\nwhether the Players’ Association has standing to challenge the\nsearch and seizure of evidence from Quest and whether the\ngovernment timely appealed Judge Cooper’s order to return\n  22\n     Recognizing that the documents they seized from CDT pursuant to the\nApril 7 search warrant might not have included all documents relevant to\nthe investigation (even with regard to Balco-related players, see infra note\n37), and deciding that the positive test results uncovered for MLB players\nbeyond the ten with Balco connections could be valuable to the investiga-\ntion, the government asked for a broader warrant on May 6 in the Central\nDistrict of California.\n\f19800     UNITED STATES v.

First, the Players’ Association repre-\nsents all MLB players, each one of whom could certainly sue\nin his own right to seek return of his own drug test records.\nSecond, the interests sought to be protected—the players’ pri-\nvacy interests in their drug testing records—are related to the\norganization’s sole purpose: to represent the best interests of\nMLB players. Third, the Players’ Association sought only the\nreturn of the players’ drug testing information and specimens;\nfor this type of prospective relief, the individual players need\nnot be a party to the action.

R. Crim.

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nProperty” was filed on November 19, 2004. In its opposition\nto that motion, the Players’ Association stated that the “gov-\nernment neither invoke[d] nor satisfie[d] any of the require-\nments of Local Rule 7-18 [“Motion for Reconsideration”] to\nsupport its request for reconsideration.” The appellees’ reply\nbrief suggests that the motion was merely “styled as one for\nreconsideration,” and does not actually qualify as such\nbecause the motion only “asked the court to water down its\nfindings” without claiming that “the Court failed to evaluate\nthe merits.”\n\n   We disagree. Like the dissent, we believe the motion was\nproperly construed as one for reconsideration. Unlike the dis-\nsent, however, we apply the local rule governing motions for\nreconsideration, and do not recharacterize the motion as a\nrequest for “Relief from Judgment or Order” under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 60(b) (“Rule 60(b)”).\n\n  [5] The motion falls squarely within the definition of a\n“Motion for Reconsideration” under C.D. Cal. Local R. 7-18\n(“Local Rule 7-18”). Judge Cooper recognized this when she\nchose to analyze the motion under Local Rule 7-18. This anal-\nysis was proper, for Local Rule 7-18 permits a party to bring\na “Motion for Reconsideration” on the basis of a “manifest\nshowing of a failure to consider material facts presented to the\nCourt before such decision.” C.D. Cal. Local R. 7-18(c). The\ngovernment made its motion on precisely these grounds.\n\n   The dissent agrees that Local Rule 7-18 applies to such\nmotions, and correctly notes that the “Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure do not provide for ‘Motions for Reconsideration.’ ”\nDissent at 19858. Instead, “such motions are creatures of local\nrule or practice.” Id. The dissent then points out a caveat:\n“Where a conflict arises between the two, federal rules must\nprevail.” Id. (citations omitted). From this point, the dissent\ndraws a far more sweeping conclusion: “For the purposes of\nappeal, when a local rule based post-judgment motion for\nreconsideration is made, we construe it either as (1) a motion\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               19803\nto alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59(e) or (2) a motion\nfiled under 60(b) for relief from judgment.” Dissent at 19859\n(citing Am.

The case\nsimply addresses which federal rule to apply to a motion not\nalready treated as a motion for reconsideration under a local\nrule.\n\n   Even more problematically, the dissent places the cart\nbefore the horse by assuming an inconsistency between the\nfederal and local rules before stating which federal rule even\napplies.25 We decline so hastily to dispose of a local rule.\n“Local rules are ‘laws of the United States,’ ” Marshall v.\nGates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686531\"><a href=\"/opinion/686531/66-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1691-30-fedrserv3d-864-bobby-rydell/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v.\nHvass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105634\"><a href=\"/opinion/105634/united-states-v-hvass/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (1958)), and “valid if . . . ‘not\ninconsistent’ with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,’ ” id.\n(citing Fed.

Rule 60(b) reads:\n\n       On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court\n       may relieve a party or a party’s legal representative\n       from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the\n       following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, sur-\n       prise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered\n       evidence which by due diligence could not have\n       been discovered in time to move for a new trial\n       under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore\n       denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresenta-\n  25\n     An initial analysis of the specific local and federal rules is necessary\nin order to decide whether the rules conflict. Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)\ndiffer greatly, and a local rule that appears inconsistent with one may well\nbe consistent with the other. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) (“Motion to Alter\nor Amend Judgment. Any motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be\nfiled no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.”); see infra at\n19803-04 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)).\n\f19804      UNITED STATES v.

In contrast, Local Rule 7-18 provides:\n\n       A motion for reconsideration of the decision on any\n       motion may be made only on the grounds of (a) a\n       material difference in fact or law from that presented\n       to the Court before such decision that in the exercise\n       of reasonable diligence could not have been known\n       to the party moving for reconsideration at the time of\n       such decision, or (b) the emergence of new material\n       facts or a change of law occurring after the time of\n       such decision, or (c) a manifest showing of a failure\n       to consider material facts presented to the Court\n       before such decision.\n\nC.D. Cal. Local R. 7-18 (emphasis added). The government’s\nmotion clearly falls under Local Rule 7-18(c), because, as the\ndissent points out, the government “assert[ed] that the court\nhad ignored evidence and arguments.” Dissent at 19863. In\ncontrast, the motion does not fall within Rule 60(b), for the\ngovernment did not request relief “from the operation of the\njudgment” but simply and expressly asked the court to “re-\nconsider and modify several aspects of this order which inac-\ncurately characterize the government’s actions.”26\n\n   The government neither requested Rule 60(b) relief nor\ncited the grounds for such relief, which include “mistake,\n  26\n   For the same reason, the motion is not one to “alter or amend the judg-\nment” under Fed.

We agree with her determi-\nnation that the shorter delay here was reasonable. One factor\nsupporting its “reasonableness” is that neither the government\nnor the movants received the order until November 2, 2004.\nGiven these circumstances, we do not believe Judge Cooper’s\ndecision to hear the motion was impermissible under the “rea-\nsonable time” period permitted under Local Rule 7-18.

In her October 1 order, Judge Cooper\naccepted this argument, finding that:\n\n     [I]n seeking the warrant (not the correct procedure\n     for obtaining documents from a third party who is\n     not a suspect), the Government explained to the\n     Magistrate that the records in question were in dan-\n     ger of being destroyed.

Magistrate Judge Johnson expressly\nfound to the contrary, and neither judge heard any evidence\nfrom witnesses as the Player’s Association had urged. In\napplying for the search warrants in this case, the government\nnever informed any judge that evidence was in danger of\nbeing destroyed. Remarkably, despite its submission of four-\nteen volumes of supplemental excerpts of record, the Players’\nAssociation provides only a solitary citation to show such\n“blatant misrepresentation.” Tellingly, the only arguable allu-\nsion to destruction of evidence is found in the government’s\nopposition to the Players’ Association’s Fed. R. Crim. P.\n41(g) motion—made after execution of the search warrants,\nnot to obtain them. There, the government retrospectively\nexplained that it “had good-faith reasons to believe that CDT\nwas detrimentally delaying the investigation, and that there\nwas some danger of the availability of the sought-after\nrecords being jeopardized.” The government never suggested\nthis concern as a reason for any court to grant a search war-\nrant in the first place. The district court’s finding to the con-\ntrary was clearly erroneous.\n\n   The Players’ Association also accuses the government of\nrepeatedly failing to inform judges from whom search war-\nrants were obtained that CDT was seeking to quash the sub-\npoena. The dissent accepts this argument and paints a picture\nof deliberate concealment. Unfortunately, this picture is not\nsupported by the record. The dissent contends that “[t]he gov-\nernment never brought to the magistrate judge’s attention that\nthere was a motion pending in the Northern District of Cali-\nfornia to quash the grand jury subpoena.” Dissent at 19836.\nHowever, in his search warrant affidavit filed on April 7,\n2004, Agent Novitsky expressly advised the court that “CDT\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             19811\nhas declined to comply with the [March 3 grand jury] sub-\npoena and has stated its intent to attempt to quash the subpoe-\nna.”\n\n   The government had no reason to refer to a pending motion\nto quash the grand jury subpoena, as no such motion was filed\nprior to April 7, 2004. Indeed, Agent Novitsky filed for the\nsearch warrant in the Central District on the same day that\nCDT moved to quash the grand jury subpoena in the Northern\nDistrict.32 Parties must reveal relevant facts, but they are not\nrequired to be prophetic.\n\n   [10] The record reflects similar candor on the part of gov-\nernment agents in the District of Nevada, where the govern-\nment submitted affidavits for a search warrant also on April\n7. There, too, the government advised the court of the existing\nsubpoena as well as Quest’s intention “to move to quash the\nsubpoena.” Alerted to the impending motion to quash, Judge\nLeavitt noted the date when the motion ultimately was filed.33\nAs in the Central District of California, the record contradicts\nany suggestion that the government failed to reveal a pending\nmotion to quash.\n\n                                   3\n\n   The Players’ Association next argues that the government\nused the search warrants for the records of the ten named\nBalco players as a pretext to seize the records of other MLB\nplayers. In support, they cite United States v. Rettig, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1978), where the police obtained a warrant for\nmarijuana paraphernalia after failing a day earlier to obtain a\nwarrant to search for evidence of a cocaine smuggling con-\nspiracy. Id. at 422-23. During the ensuing search, officers told\n  32\n      The record does not contain evidence that the motion to quash was\nfiled in the Northern District early enough in the day for the government\nto know of it before filing its affidavit in the Central District.\n   33\n      See supra note 10.\n\f19812    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nthe suspect’s wife to “tell us where [the cocaine] is so we\ndon’t have to mess up your house.” Id. at 422 n.1.\n\n   Such egregious police misconduct did not occur here.\nAgents executing the warrant at CDT were authorized to seize\nthe drug testing records of the ten named Balco players. In\ntheir lawful search for those records, they found paper and\nelectronic data related to those players, intermingled with data\npertaining to additional MLB players not mentioned in the\nsearch warrant. One document, at issue here, was a spread-\nsheet of positive drug test results, where results for eight of\nthe ten named Balco players were intermingled with results\nfor other MLB players. Because the agents saw that the\nspreadsheet clearly contained information within the scope of\nthe warrant, they seized the spreadsheet for off-site review.\n\n   [11] The record contains no support for the assertion that\nagents specifically targeted and seized records unrelated to the\nplayers mentioned in the search warrant. To the contrary, the\nagents narrowed their seizures to files containing information\non the named Balco players, and during the May 6 search at\nQuest, they seized specimens belonging only to the ten Balco\nplayers. Finally, the agents copied relevant files in order to\navoid an excessively long and intrusive on-site search,\nalthough duplication risked the loss of deleted documents that\nwould only be visible on the original drives.\n\n  [12] We see no evidence of bad faith or pretext here.\n\n                               4\n\n   Nor does the seizure of intermingled documents demon-\nstrate “a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 325 (stating the first factor\nweighing in favor of equitable jurisdiction over a motion for\nreturn of property).

Id. at 876-77. The Beusch court concluded\nthat no Fourth Amendment violation occurred when agents\nseized “single files and single ledgers, i.e., single items which,\nthough theoretically separable, in fact constitute one volume\nor file folder.” Id. at 877.\n\n   The Beusch court expressly limited its reach, however:\n“[T]he reasons we have given for allowing [such] seizure may\nnot apply to sets of ledgers or files, but because that is not the\ncase here, we find it unnecessary to discuss it further.” Id.\nThree years later, the court addressed the seizure of sets of\nfiles. See Tamura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Tamura, the court\nreviewed the conduct of officers executing a search warrant,\nwhich authorized seizure of three specific categories of\nrecords from a Los Angeles office. Id. at 594. In that case,\nagents seized—without any limiting effort—files unrelated to\nthe items mentioned in the search warrant. Id. at 595. The\nTamura court condemned such “wholesale seizure for later\ndetailed examination of records not described in a warrant.”\nId.\n\n   Unfortunately, the Tamura court did not answer a more dif-\nficult question: “Because seizable materials are seldom found\nneatly separated from their non-seizable counterparts, how\nmuch separating must police do at the scene to avoid taking\n\f19814      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nitems that are neither contraband nor evidence of criminal\nactivity?” Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 1088. As the Hill court\nnoted, the answer turns upon “reasonableness,” id., a standard\nthat offers little guidance to government agents. Understand-\nably, the Tamura court sought to give more concrete advice\nto help agents remain within the bounds of the Fourth Amend-\nment. The court suggested:\n\n       In the comparatively rare instances where documents\n       are so intermingled that they cannot feasibly be\n       sorted on site, we suggest that the Government and\n       law enforcement officials generally can avoid violat-\n       ing fourth amendment rights by sealing and holding\n       the documents pending approval by a magistrate of\n       a further search, in accordance with the procedures\n       set forth in the American Law Institute’s Model\n       Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure.\n\nTamura, 694 F.2d at 595-96 (emphasis added). Given that the\nTamura court found that the agents had violated Fourth\nAmendment rights by making a “wholesale seizure,” id. at\n595, this alternative, protective approach was advisory dicta\nin that case. See Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 1090 (noting that\nafter the Tamura court “held that the government’s wholesale\nseizure of company documents was illegal because the agents\nintentionally seized materials they knew were not covered by\nthe warrant . . . the Tamura court suggested, albeit in dicta,\nthat [for such seizure of all computer storage media] a warrant\nwould be appropriate.” (emphasis added)).34\n\n  [14] The Tamura court also stated that substitute protective\nprocedures could be specified in a search warrant, pursuant to\nwhich “all items in a set of files may be inspected during a\nsearch.” Id. at 595 (emphasis added).

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               19815\nsearch warrants spelled out such specific procedures that the\nagents were to follow. We believe that the agents in the cases\nat bar complied with the procedures specified in the warrant:\n\n       Upon searching the premises, law enforcement per-\n       sonnel trained in searching and seizing computer\n       data (the “computer personnel”) . . . [to] make an ini-\n       tial review of any computer equipment and storage\n       devices to determine whether these items can be\n       searched on-site in a reasonable amount of time and\n       without jeopardizing the ability to preserve the data.\n       ...\n\n       If the computer personnel determine that it is not\n       practical to perform an on-site search or make an on-\n       site copy of the data within a reasonable amount of\n       time, then the computer equipment and storage\n       devices will be seized and transported to an appro-\n       priate law enforcement laboratory for review.\n\nThe government executed the warrant under the guidance of\nAgent Abboud—a Computer Investigative Specialist,35 and\ntook care to avoid unreasonable seizures.\n\n   Even so, the Players’ Association contends that the govern-\nment breached the warrant’s protocol, because Agent\nNovitzky opened and viewed the contents of the Tracey direc-\ntory, rather than leaving Agent Abboud to search alone.\nUnder this view, only Agent Abboud qualified as the “appro-\npriately trained personnel” and no other agent had authority\nto open and to view CDT computer data. However, the plain\n  35\n     We note that these requirements are not the mandates of the Fourth\nAmendment. If the warrant had not specified the need for computer ana-\nlysts, police would have been “free to hire such experts to help them con-\nduct a search . . . and it may well be praiseworthy for them to do so. . . .\nBut the Fourth Amendment does not require it.” Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d at\n1088 (citing Tamura and other cases that suggest the involvement of spe-\ncialized personnel) (citations omitted).\n\f19816     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nlanguage of the search warrant does not exclude the assistance\nof other law enforcement officers—especially for tasks\ninvolving non-digital work (such as seeking cooperation from\npersons on site). The warrant only required that computer per-\nsonnel assess the possibility of on site search completion. It\ndid not preclude others from assisting the computer personnel.36\nThe sort of assistance provided by Agent Novitzky, a non-\nspecialized law enforcement officer, was permissible under\nthe search warrant and was reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\n   [15] Moreover, the agents did not remove files without a\nrelation to the Balco investigation and did not seize entire cat-\negories of documents to coerce employees into cooperation,\nas did the agents in Tamura. See 694 F.2d at 595. Their ulti-\nmate decision to remove a relevant number of files for off-site\nreview stemmed not from disregard of privacy rights, but\nfrom sensitivity to the ongoing disruption caused by the\nsearch to CDT—an innocent third party in the underlying\n  36\n    We do not believe that the warrant can be fairly read to require com-\nputer personnel to execute all aspects of the search. For example, the more\nbasic computer recoveries could easily be completed by nonspecialized\nlaw enforcement officers, considering that the type of files at issue were\nsimple spreadsheets. In today’s world anyone with the most rudimentary\ncomputer skills qualifies as “appropriately trained” when it comes to open-\ning and viewing basic spreadsheets on a modern computer: presumably\nany computer user can double-click a selected document or press the\n“Enter” key after selecting the desired file.\n   We recognize that, had CDT stored test results in a Relational Database\nManagement System requiring specialized expertise to extract data, only\nan agent specifically trained in using such a system might be considered\n“appropriately trained.” However, we do not interpret the warrant to\nrequire only Computer Investigative Specialists to perform elementary\ntasks such as scan a spreadsheet for the persons named in a search warrant,\nparticularly when, in the end, the spreadsheets would still have been\nseized. The search warrant form employed in these cases authorized a\nsearch by “Any Special Agent[s] with the United States Internal Revenue\nService or any other authorized officer,” and was not restricted to searches\nonly by computer investigative specialists.\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 19817\ninvestigation. The agents permitted CDT to retain the original\nTracey directory, even though they later explained that this\ndecision may have prevented them from accessing deleted or\ntemporary files that could not be transferred by duplication.37\nThe agents took only a limited set of clearly relevant disks\nand a copy of the Tracey directory, which included informa-\ntion on players specifically named in the search warrant. Fur-\nthermore, just eight days after the search warrant, the agents\nprovided copies of all seized documents to CDT. Here again,\nthe agents demonstrated the careful regard absent in Tamura.38\n\n   We reject the dissent’s view that government officials\nshould limit their computer searches to key words suggested\nby a searched party. Criticizing the government for “cop[y-\ning] the entire directory” rather than “copying only the subdi-\nrectories that pertained to Major League Baseball,” the dissent\nsuggests that the government should have trusted CDT to\n   37\n      Recognizing that the documents they seized on April 8 may not have\nincluded all documents relevant to the investigation, Agent Novitzky\nasked for a broader warrant on May 5 in the Central District of California.\nHe explained that “IRS Special Agent Jeff Jack, a Computer Investigative\nSpecialist . . . gave me specific examples of deleted files or temporary files\ncreated when printing a file that cannot be[ ] seen or retrieved from a sim-\nple copy of a computer sub-directory, but may be retrievable using foren-\nsic tools, if allowed to examine the entire computer system.” Had the\ngovernment engaged in a “wholesale seizure” of all possibly relevant\nmaterial, as in Tamura, they surely would have seized the entire comput-\ners, rather than made duplicates so as to allow CDT to continue its use of\nthe originals.

Like most searched\nparties, CDT had an incentive to avoid giving over documents\nthe government might not know to miss. The government had\nno reason to confine its search to “key words” such as the\nnames of the baseball players. Such a limited search could\neasily have overlooked relevant documents, as it would have\nin the case of the seizures at Quest. There, testing results were\nnot saved by key word at all. They were labeled with identifi-\ncation numbers, whose connection to specific players could\nnot be found within the document or at the facility, but were\nlinked in a document kept in a storage locker located at a dif-\nferent address. See supra Section I.B, notes 13-14 and accom-\npanying text.\n\n   [17] The government was not required to believe, and had\nno reason to assume, that all relevant documents in the Tracey\nDirectory would be listed under the names of the baseball\nplayers in the warrant. The government’s decision to copy the\nentire directory represented a conscientious effort to seek out\nall the evidence covered by the search warrant.

In seizing\nthese files, the government did not show “callous disregard\nfor the constitutional rights of the movant,” Ramsden, 2 F.3d\nat 325, but instead displayed attentiveness both to the war-\nrant’s precautionary procedures and to the importance of\navoiding unnecessary disruption of CDT’s business opera-\ntions. For these reasons, we conclude that the first prong of\nthe Ramsden analysis (the existence of “callous disregard”)\nweighs against invocation of the district court’s equitable\njurisdiction over the Fed.

See\nRamsden, 2 F.3d at 326 (holding that three factors justified\nexercise of equitable jurisdiction to hear Fed. R. Crim. P.\n41(g) motion).

The advisory committee note explains: “If the United\nStates has a need for the property in an investigation or prose-\ncution, its retention of the property generally is reasonable.”\nFed. R. Crim. P. 41 advisory committee’s note.\n\n   [21] It is when the government no longer needs the prop-\nerty as evidence that a presumption arises, giving the owner\na right to have the property returned. Fitzen, 80 F.3d at 388.\nHere, the government already has provided copies of all docu-\nments seized, and it states that the remaining evidence is\nessential to its investigation and prosecution of the distribu-\ntion of illegal steroids. This legitimate law enforcement pur-\npose makes return of the intermingled evidence improper, as\nthe files were seized legally under the search warrant and our\nprecedent.\n\n   Moreover, even in cases where agents seized too much evi-\ndence, we have noted that return of property should follow\nonly a particularly egregious violation: “The issue is whether\nthe Government’s conduct was sufficiently reprehensible in\nthis case to warrant this sanction.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 327.\nIn Ramsden, we refused to impose this extreme sanction on\npolice who had time to obtain a warrant but made no effort\nto do so and “simply chose not to comply with [their] obliga-\ntions under the Fourth Amendment.” Id. at 325, 327.\n\n   [22] Our governing precedent offers no support for a full\nreturn of the intermingled evidence. Indeed, both the Beusch\nand Tamura courts underscored the need for effective crimi-\nnal law enforcement. Thus, the Beusch court resolved: “As\n\f19822     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nlong as an item appears, at the time of the search, to contain\nevidence reasonably related to the purposes of the search,\nthere is no reason—absent some other Fourth Amendment\nviolation—to suppress it.” 596 F.2d at 877. Even the Tamura\ncourt—which determined that the agents unambiguously\nflouted the limits of the search warrant—concluded: “[W]e\ncannot say, although we find it a close case, that the officers\nso abused the warrant’s authority that the otherwise valid war-\nrant was transformed into a general one, thereby requiring all\nfruits to be suppressed.” Tamura, 694 F.2d at 597.\n\n   In Tamura, the government did not seek to use evidence at\ntrial that fell outside the scope of the warrant. Therefore, the\ncourt found return of the seized property inappropriate, even\nthough some evidence had been unlawfully taken. In the cases\nbefore us today, the government has made clear that it desires\nto use only information related to the ten named Balco players\nand to other players who tested positive—and who therefore\nmay have become targets of an expanded grand jury\ninvestigation—as a result of intermingled information we\nhave determined was seized lawfully under the warrant.\nWhile we agree that some information still retained by the\ngovernment, at least in duplicate, may fall outside the scope\nof the warrant, we do not believe a return of the lawfully\nseized intermingled evidence properly remedies that wrong.40\n\n   [23] Thus, the district courts erred in granting the Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 41(g) motions and ordering the government to return\nall evidence seized from CDT and Quest—and all related\nnotes by agents who reviewed the evidence—that did not\nrelate to the ten Balco players expressly named in the search\nwarrants.\n  40\n    The orders of the two district courts would require the return of all\nevidence other than that related to the ten named players. We have\ndescribed in detail why this view misinterprets Tamura in a way that\nwould invalidate lawful and reasonable searches and seizures. It would\nalso hamper the public interest in full and comprehensive investigations as\nleads unfold in the course of the grand jury’s inquiries.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19823\n                                     B\n\n   [24] We are persuaded that the government’s seizure of\nintermingled evidence for off-site review was lawful and rea-\nsonable, and we view the two orders requiring return of all\nproperty related to players not specifically named as both\nunjustified and improper. However, the government has yet to\ncomply with its duty of adequate off-site review. Tamura\noffered a suggested procedure for review by a neutral magis-\ntrate, and we conclude that such review is necessary to ensure\nthat the seizure of intermingled computer records remains rea-\nsonable.\n\n   The Tamura court urged that off-site review be conducted\nby a magistrate, in order to avoid giving the task to a party\nwith an interest in retaining too much.41 We cannot accept the\ngovernment’s argument that it may retain all evidence simply\nbecause it assured the Players’ Association and CDT (without\nsigns of bad faith) that it did not intend to use all the files. In\nthe case of a lawful and reasonable seizure of intermingled\ncomputer records for off-site review, as at bar, our precedents\nand the general reasonableness mandate of the Fourth Amend-\nment require the supervision of a magistrate. It is not reason-\nable to allow the government to seize an indeterminately\nbounded array of computer data only later to set its own stan-\ndards for review and retention thereof.42\n  41\n      It is not necessary that a magistrate always give advance authorization\nfor seizures of intermingled evidence. Here, as in United States v. Hay,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771007\"><a href=\"/opinion/771007/united-states-v-alexander-montagu-hay/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2000), we do not read Tamura to require prior\nauthorization for off-site review. See id. at 637 (finding Tamura “inappo-\nsite . . . for its suggestion that magistrate judges should approve seizure\nof materials beyond those described in the warrant before wholesale\nremoval occurs” (emphasis added)). However, we still read Tamura to\napply in a significant way in the context of lawful seizures of intermingled\ncomputer data.\n   42\n      We do not belabor the government’s alleged failure to follow its own\ninternal guidelines. The dissent takes note that the U.S. Attorney’s manual\nstates “that a search warrant should normally not be used to obtain confi-\n\f19824     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n  It is true that Tamura proposed a pragmatic approach, and\nnot a constitutional rule. We recognize that some courts in\nother circuits have questioned the procedures advised in\nTamura. One district court in Michigan explained: “The Court\ndeclines to follow Tamura, at least in this case, because\nTamura did not involve computer files and therefore did not\nconsider the specific problems associated with conducting a\nsearch for computerized records.” Scott-Emuakpor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">288443</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8. Although declining to apply Tamura’s prag-\nmatic approach to computer searches, Judge Quist stated:\n“This is not to suggest that seizure of all computer disks is\npermissible whenever the warrant authorizes the seizure of\ncomputer records.” Id. Another court, also referencing\nTamura, noted that in the modern computer context a “ ‘sug-\ngestion’ by a panel of the Ninth Circuit in a 20-plus year old\ncase is not persuasive.” United States v. Kaufman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2304345</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 n.3 (D. Kan).\n\n   Like these district courts from other circuits, we recognize\nthat the computer era adds new complexity to the test of rea-\nsonableness under the Fourth Amendment. Precisely for this\nreason, we view Tamura as especially important in the com-\nputer context. Although indeed writing over two decades ago,\nthe Tamura court appreciated the same dual—and sometimes\nconflicting—interests of minimizing the intrusiveness of\nsearches and containing the breadth of seizures. The Tamura\ncourt stated that “large-scale removal of material” can be jus-\ntified “where on-site sorting is infeasible and no other practi-\ncal alternative exists,” Tamura, 694 F.2d at 596, but also\n\ndential materials such as treatment records,” and that the Department of\nJustice’s guidelines disfavor use of a search warrant where a subpoena\nwould suffice. See Dissent at 19866. The existence of those guidelines is\nnot disputed. Yet, quite simply, the government’s guidelines do not dictate\nwhat is “reasonable” under the Fourth Amendment. If its guidelines did\nso, the government would have every reason to enact permissive internal\nrules. We have no reason or authority to give the government that perverse\nincentive.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 19825\nadvised that a magistrate should oversee the off-site review of\ndocuments. We conclude that upon a proper post-seizure\nmotion by the aggrieved parties, the record should be sealed\nand reviewed by a magistrate—such as the one who originally\nissued the warrant.43 This procedure affords the necessary pro-\ntection against unreasonable retention of property after a sei-\nzure of intermingled computer data.\n\n   Insofar as the dissent emphasizes the crucial need to set\nparameters on government seizures and retention of intermin-\ngled computer evidence, we agree. On the other hand, the dis-\nsent attempts to limit computer searches and seizures to an\nunreasonable degree—one neither warranted by the Constitu-\ntion nor by our precedent. The dissent would affirm the dis-\ntrict courts’ Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) orders in toto, relying upon\nTamura yet failing to recognize the continued relevance of\nBeusch. This extreme approach, which would forbid the sei-\nzure of intermingled data, would compel law enforcement\nagents, when unexpectedly confronted with intermingled\ncomputer data, to give up the search and leave. They could\nonly return to the scene if equipped with a new warrant autho-\nrizing removal of the specific intermingled evidence, repeat-\ning this procedure until all relevant intermingled evidence\nwere obtained. After many such warrants and intrusions, the\nintermingled evidence might well no longer be intact. More-\nover, rather than limit the intrusiveness of a search and sei-\n   43\n      The dissent mistakenly concludes that this procedure allows the gov-\nernment to establish “what the Fourth Amendment required it to do in the\nfirst : instance: [that] probable cause exists to seize and search the proper-\nty.” Dissent at 19894. The point of the Tamura procedure is to ensure that\nintermingled documents, legitimately seized for off-site review under a\nwarrant supported by probable cause, do not contain documents that turn\nout, upon scrutiny, to be easily separable. In a seizure of a plethora of doc-\numents containing relevant material interspersed with irrelevant docu-\nments, it is predictable that some documents, although legitimately seized\nfor off-site review, turn out to be separable without changing the nature\nof the relevant documents. The purpose of the Tamura procedure is to\nmonitor the off-site separation process, not to establish probable cause.\n\f19826     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nzure of intermingled computer data by allowing the\ngovernment to remove the whole for off-site review, the dis-\nsent’s approach would magnify unnecessarily the burdens\nimposed by computer search warrants, both on the govern-\nment and on the parties searched, with no corresponding ben-\nefit in light of the constitutional linchpin of reasonableness in\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\n   [25] We conclude that, while the government may seize\nintermingled data for off-site review to minimize intrusive-\nness of a computer search, it may not retain or use the evi-\ndence after proper objections are raised, unless a magistrate\nsubsequently reviews and filters the evidence off-site.44 The\nmagistrate must adhere to our precedent in a balanced man-\nner. In her review, the magistrate should apply our precedent,\nincluding Beusch, which permits the seizure of single ledgers\nor files with intermingled data. In the context of computer\nfiles, we believe that most seized materials can be pared down\nconsiderably, but that certain files—spreadsheets of only a\nfew pages, for example—may be retained in whole.45\n\n  After the magistrate determines which sealed items fall\nwithin the search warrant, the government may retain and use\n  44\n      We note that the government has little to lose by following this pre-\ncaution. A magistrate will allocate to the government whatever property\nit may legitimately retain under the warrant. Yet if agents rely on their\nown judgment, they may err on the side of retaining items outside the\nsearch warrant or err on the side of returning evidence our precedents\nwould permit them to retain.\n   45\n      In this analysis, the magistrate may consider relevant, among other\nfactors: 1) whether evidence mentioned in the search warrant can be sepa-\nrated from unrelated evidence by copying or moving files, but without cre-\nating new documents, 2) whether the file, if printed, would fill more than\na typical paper ledger (of the sort in Beusch), 3) whether excision of the\nunrelated portions of the document would distort the character of the origi-\nnal document. This list is neither exhaustive nor mandatory, but offers rel-\nevant considerations for a magistrate to determine what evidence the\ngovernment can reasonably retain after a lawful seizure of intermingled\ndigital data.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19827\nsuch items; all others must be returned to the person or entity\nsearched.46 The government is always free to seek judicial\nauthorization, either through subsequent search warrants or\ndistrict court authorization on review of the magistrate’s rul-\nings, to justify expansion of the investigation upon proper\nshowing of any item’s relevancy to suspected criminal behav-\nior uncovered during review of the evidence initially seized.\n\n   [26] In this case, we conclude that the proper remedy is to\nremand these Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) matters to the appropriate\ndistrict courts, for the purpose of sealing the materials seized\nunder the search warrants and transferring them to a magis-\ntrate for expeditious review and isolation of the files that the\ngovernment may legally retain.\n\n                                     V\n\n   Finally, we consider the government’s appeal of Judge Ills-\nton’s order quashing the May 6 subpoenas, which sought drug\ntesting records and specimens for all MLB players who tested\npositive for steroids.47\n\n   [27] Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(2), a “court may quash\n. . . [a] subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or\noppressive.” The district court found that the May 2004 sub-\npoenas constituted harassment and were unreasonable.48\n  46\n      This approach does not permit the government to seize computer files\n“wholesale,” without any effort to limit the documents seized. Nothing we\nsuggest lifts the Fourth Amendment’s bar on “unreasonable searches and\nseizures.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. Like the Beusch and Tamura courts, we\npoint out the parameters of a reasonable search and seizure in the complex\ncontext of intermingled files. Case-by-case evaluation remains essential,\nbecause our Founding Fathers chose a general prohibition on unreasonable\nsearches; they did not create a rigid rule that could at times prove too per-\nmissive and at times prove too strict.\n   47\n      We review a district court’s decision to quash a grand jury subpoena\nfor abuse of discretion. In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 803 F.2d at 496.\n   48\n      The district court did not find that the subpoenas were oppressive.\n\f19828   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   To support its finding, the district court pointed to United\nStates v. American Honda Motor Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248483\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248483/united-states-v-american-honda-motor-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D.\nIll. 1967). In American Honda, the government issued sub-\npoenas that were “substantially identical” to one another but\nin different locations. Id. at 819. As a result, Honda was faced\nwith producing the same documents repeatedly, and the court\nfound this to be harassment. Id. at 819-20. American Honda,\nhowever, does not preclude the government from pursuing the\nsame information through the contemporaneous issuance of\nsubpoenas and applications for search warrants.\n\n   We addressed the issuance of contemporaneous search war-\nrants and subpoenas in In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated\nDecember 10, 1987, 926 F.2d at 854. There we upheld the\nvalidity of the subpoenas against the challenge that “the sub-\npoenas were served at the same time as the search warrants\nand the federal agents attempted to ‘enforce’ the subpoenas\nthrough immediate seizure of the documents.” Id. at 854. Not-\ning that the challenge to the subpoenas received no support in\nprecedent, we clarified the differences between subpoenas and\nsearch warrants:\n\n    Subpoenas are not search warrants. They involve dif-\n    ferent levels of intrusion on a person’s privacy. A\n    search warrant allows the officer to enter the per-\n    son’s premises, and to examine for himself the per-\n    son’s belongings. The officer, pursuant to the\n    warrant, determines what is seized.\n\nId. By comparison:\n\n    Service of a forthwith subpoena does not authorize\n    an entry into a private residence. Furthermore, the\n    person served determines whether he will surrender\n    the items identified in the subpoena or challenge the\n    validity of the subpoena prior to compliance.\n\nId. We concluded that “[t]hese differences are not eliminated\nby the fact that the search warrants and subpoenas were deliv-\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19829\nered at the same time” and observed that the complaining\nparty had “failed to show that the papers that are described in\nthe subpoenas are outside the scope of a legitimate investiga-\ntion by the grand jury.” Id. at 854-55. In addition, we specifi-\ncally emphasized the fact that the defendant was given almost\na month to comply with the subpoenas. Id. at 854.\n\n   [28] Therefore, the district court erred in finding the issu-\nance of subpoenas and the contemporaneous execution of\nsearch warrants to be unreasonable. The Players’ Association\nhas not argued that the evidence sought by the subpoenas is\n“outside the scope of a legitimate investigation by the grand\njury.” Id. at 855. The subpoenas were not returnable on the\nsame day that the search warrants were executed. As in In re\nGrand Jury Subpoenas, the return dates on the subpoenas\nwere over a month from the date on which the warrants were\nexecuted. The district court declared the May 6 subpoenas an\n“unreasonable insurance” policy, but it failed to recognize the\ndifferent purposes and requirements of the warrant as com-\npared to the subpoena and the legitimate concern that produc-\ntion of relevant evidence to the grand jury would be unduly\ndelayed. See id. at 854. It was error to conflate the two dis-\ntinct tools. Insurance it may have been; but, under the Fourth\nAmendment, unreasonable it was not.\n\n   The district court also deemed the government’s actions\nunreasonable because it found that the agents sought search\nwarrants in three separate districts in an attempt to avoid a\nruling on the motion to quash the existing subpoenas of Janu-\nary and March 2004. We note that granting the motion to\nquash would not have prevented the government from seeking\nthe search warrants, particularly given the existence of proba-\nble cause. As the Fourth Circuit has noted, “the fact that a\ngrand jury subpoena existed . . . at the time of the search obvi-\nously had no effect upon whether probable cause existed to\nsearch . . . for documents which were properly included\nwithin the warrant’s scope.” United States v.

In the appeals at bar,\nthe records contain extremely sensitive information, espe-\ncially the drug-testing records. If revealed, this information\ncould adversely affect the reputations of many competitive\nbaseball players. Therefore, the motion to unseal requires a\ncareful balancing of the interests at stake. See id. (noting that\naccess to judicial records may be limited to protect the pri-\nvacy interests of the litigants, such as to avoid disclosure of\n“sources of business information that might harm a litigant’s\ncompetitive standing”).\n\n   Although we have jurisdiction to conduct a merits analysis\nof the motion to unseal, the district courts—having greater\nfamiliarity with the records51 —are in a better position to bal-\nance the privacy interests and to determine which materials\nare protected grand jury materials. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).\n  50\n     Gerstein premises his motion on Ninth Circuit Rule 27-13(c). That\nrule states: “During the pendency of an appeal, any party may file a\nmotion with this court requesting that matters filed under seal either in the\ndistrict court or in this court be unsealed. Any motion shall be served on\nall parties.” Id. (emphasis added). Although Joshua Gerstein is not a\n“party” under this rule, his standing derives from his constitutional interest\nand does not depend upon the applicability of Ninth Circuit Rule 27-13(c).\n  51\n    Sensitive portions of the records were neither revealed nor discussed\nat oral argument before this court. See supra note 49.\n\f19832     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nTherefore, we refer the Gerstein motion to the district courts\nfor consideration upon remand.52\n\n                                   VII\n\n   We now summarize the resolution of these consolidated\nappeals. We conclude that the government’s seizures were\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and that the district\ncourts erred in ruling that Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) required\nreturn of all property and agent review notes unrelated to the\nten expressly named Balco players.\n\n   At the same time, we recognize limits to the government’s\nright to retain evidence seized, even where a broad seizure is\nreasonable in order to avoid lengthy and intrusive on-site\ninspection. Our Fourth Amendment precedents explain that\nthe government may retain single “ledgers” of intermingled\nevidence, but may not keep separate, unrelated evidence. A\nmagistrate is in the best position to sort through the actual evi-\ndence and to determine those files that may be kept when\naggrieved parties seek relief. Readily separable evidence\nunrelated to persons named in the search warrants must be\nreturned. The Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) cases must be remanded\nto the District of Nevada and Central District of California to\npermit such review of the sealed documents by magistrates.\n\n   With regard to the May 6 subpoenas, which covered the\nsame evidence as the contemporaneous search warrants, we\nconclude the order of the Northern District of California\nquashing the subpoenas was an abuse of discretion. The\nrecord, illuminated by caselaw, reveals that the subpoenas\nwere not unreasonable and did not constitute harassment.\n  52\n    In the Central District of California and District of Nevada, the motion\ncan be addressed during the remand pursuant to this opinion. See infra\nSection VII. The motion will need to be separately decided in the Northern\nDistrict of California.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19833\n   [30] Therefore, the orders of the Central District of Califor-\nnia, the District of Nevada, and the Northern District of Cali-\nfornia cannot stand. The three cases consolidated in this\nappeal are hereby\n\n  REVERSED in part and REMANDED in part.\n\n\n\nTHOMAS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   One of the three extremely able district court judges who\nrejected the government’s argument summarized it best, stat-\ning: “What happened to the Fourth Amendment? Was it\nrepealed somehow?”\n\n   Although it only had a search warrant for data concerning\neleven Major League Baseball players, the government seized\nthousands of medical records and test results involving every\nsingle Major League Baseball player. The government did not\nstop there, seizing thousands of other medical records for\nindividuals in thirteen other major sports organizations, three\nunaffiliated business entities, and three sports competitions.\nThe government now seeks to retain all of the medical infor-\nmation it obtained about persons who were not the subject of\nany criminal inquiry.\n\n   The stakes in this case are high. The government claims the\nright to search—without warrant or even a suspicion of crimi-\nnal activity—any patient’s confidential medical record con-\ntained in a computer directory so long as it has a legitimate\nwarrant or subpoena for any other individual patient’s record\nthat may be contained as part of data stored on the same com-\nputer. The government attempts to justify this novel theory on\na breathtaking expansion of the “plain view” doctrine, which\nclearly has no application to intermingled private electronic\ndata.\n\f19834   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   As radical as the government’s position is, the majority\ngoes even further. It holds that the government—without war-\nrant or even a suspicion of criminal activity—may seize,\nretain, and view all confidential records in any electronic\ndatabase on which private data responsive to a warrant\nresides. Under the majority’s holding, a magistrate would be\nrequired to review the seized data for probable cause after sei-\nzure only if an aggrieved party made a motion. Even then, if\nthe magistrate concluded that the irrelevant data was “co-\nmingled,” the government would be entitled to retain the con-\nfidential medical records. This new theory was not argued by\nany party, nor presented to any district judge at any time dur-\ning the course of these protracted and hotly contested pro-\nceedings.\n\n   The scope of the majority’s new holding in the digital age\ncould not be greater; it removes confidential electronic\nrecords from the protections of the Fourth Amendment. The\nholding also squarely conflicts with the sound and sensible\nprocedural protections detailed in United States v. Tamura,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982), which direct the government to seal and\nhold documents containing intermingled data pending\napproval of a magistrate of a further search.\n\n   I agree with the careful findings and conclusions of the\nthree district judges who rejected the government’s position.\nFor that reason, and because of the profound consequences of\nthe majority’s opinion on the privacy of medical records\nthroughout the United States, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                               I\n\n   The investigation in this case ostensibly involved Bay Area\nLab Co-Operative, popularly referenced as “Balco.” The gov-\nernment suspected Balco of distributing illegal steroids to cer-\ntain athletes, including some Major League Baseball players.\nThe government knew that, pursuant to a collective bargain-\ning agreement between the Major League Players Association\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19835\n(“Players Association” or “MLBPA”) and Major League\nBaseball, confidential testing had been analyzed by Compre-\nhensive Drug Testing, Inc. (“CDT”), and other laboratories,\nfor the sole purpose of determining whether Major League\nBaseball should adopt an individualized steroid testing pro-\ngram.\n\n   Through the collective bargaining agreement, the players\nwere assured that the testing would be anonymous and confi-\ndential, and that the samples and individual data would be\ndestroyed upon tabulation of the results. The only object of\nthe exercise was to determine the approximate magnitude of\napparent steroid use with the goal of fashioning appropriate\npolicies to address it. The collective bargaining agreement\nacknowledged and anticipated that the tests for some players\nmight well yield positive results due to the ingestion of legal\nand proper over-the-counter supplements.\n\n   Although information developed by the government in its\ncriminal investigation pointed only to specific individuals\nwho might be involved with Balco, the government served a\ngrand jury subpoena on CDT on January 16, 2004, seeking\ndrug tests for all major league baseball players. After receiv-\ning the subpoena, the Players Association and CDT contacted\nthe United States Attorneys’ Office to discuss their concerns\nwith the breadth of the subpoena. At the government’s\nrequest, the Players Association, CDT, and Major League\nBaseball prepared and presented a “white paper” to the gov-\nernment detailing the provisions of the collective bargaining\nagreement pertaining to testing, with emphasis on the many\nconfidentiality provisions, and raising concerns about the\ninvasion of the constitutionally-protected privacy interests of\nthe players who were not involved in the Balco investigation.\n\n   The Players Association and CDT assured the government\nin writing that CDT would maintain all of the subpoenaed\nrecords until the disputes were resolved by negotiation or liti-\ngation. On February 4, 2003, the Chief of the Criminal Divi-\n\f19836    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nsion wrote the counsel for CDT indicating that the\ngovernment had accepted the assurances by CDT that none of\nthe materials sought by the subpoena would be destroyed or\naltered pending the government’s reconsideration of the sub-\npoena and a motion to quash the subpoena, if filed.\n\n   On February 12, 2004, the grand jury returned a 42-count\nindictment against Victor Conte, Jr. (Balco’s founder), James\nJ. Valente (Balco’s Vice President), Greg F. Anderson (a\ntrainer), and Remi Korchemny (a track coach). The charges\nagainst the defendants included conspiracy to possess with\nintent to distribute anabolic steroids, possession with intent to\ndistribute anabolic steroids, introduction and delivery of mis-\nbranded drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud,\nand misbranding of drugs held for sale with intent to defraud.\n\n   On March 3, the government served a second grand jury\nsubpoena on CDT, seeking information on only eleven named\nbaseball players. However, it did not withdraw the January 16\nsubpoena. On April 7, with no compromise reached and with\na return date passed, the Players Association filed a motion in\nthe Northern District of California in San Francisco to quash\nthe CDT subpoena. The motion was assigned to Judge Jeffery\nS. White.\n\n   After learning that a motion to quash would be filed but\nbefore the motion could be heard, the government applied for\na search warrant to search the CDT offices for the same infor-\nmation it was seeking in the grand jury subpoena. The search\nwarrant application was made some 240 miles away in\nanother federal judicial district, without notice to the Players\nAssociation or to the district court in the Northern District of\nCalifornia.\n\n  In the search warrant proceedings in the Central District of\nCalifornia, the government never brought to the magistrate\njudge’s attention that there was a motion pending before\nJudge White in the Northern District of California to quash\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19837\nthe grand jury subpoena. The affidavit did not disclose that\nthe Players Association had joined the motion. Rather, the\naffidavit stated:\n\n      The referenced grand jury subpoena, for the items\n      listed in Attachment B, was issued; however, while\n      not denying that they have the requested materials,\n      CDT has declined to comply with the subpoena and\n      has stated its intent to attempt to quash the subpoena.1\n\n   The affidavit did not disclose that CDT had agreed in writ-\ning to keep the data and other materials secured until the\nscope of the grand jury subpoena was settled, either through\nnegotiation or a ruling on a motion to quash. Rather, the affi-\ndavit justified removing computer data and equipment from\nthe searched premises on the basis that the computer data\ncould be concealed, altered, or destroyed by the user.\n\n   The affidavit also informed the magistrate judge that\n“[c]omputer hardware and storage devices may contain\n‘booby traps’ that destroy or alter data if certain procedures\nare not scrupulously followed.” It noted that computer data\nwas “particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nmodification or destruction.”\n\n   The government did not have any evidence or reason to\nbelieve that CDT had engaged in steganography, booby-\ntrapping computers, or any type of data destruction or alter-\n  1\n    Some months later, Judge Illston asked the government: “Did you\nexplain to Judge Johnson what was happening before Judge White, even\non the day that you got him to issue the warrant?” Government counsel\nreplied, “We did inform Judge Johnson of the existence of the grand jury\nsubpoena and it’s in the warrant application of Judge Johnson that defense\nhad indicated that it wanted to move to quash the subpoena. So we did\nindicate to Judge Johnson there was a disputed grand jury issue. Yes, it\nwas disclosed to Judge Johnson.” Neither the warrant application nor the\naffidavit filed in support of the application contain any reference to pend-\ning proceedings before Judge White.\n\f19838    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nation. To the contrary, it had accepted in writing CDT’s assur-\nances “that CDT will maintain and preserve all materials\ncalled for by the first subpoena as well as any materials called\nfor by the new subpoena” and that “CDT would not destroy\nor alter any of the materials called for by either of the subpoe-\nnas.” However, the plain import of the application was that\nCDT was improperly resisting compliance with a valid grand\njury subpoena and data was in jeopardy of being destroyed.\n\n   Based on the government’s application, a search warrant\nwas issued by Magistrate Judge Jeffery W. Johnson in the\nCentral District of California in Los Angeles. The warrant\nauthorized the seizure of records regarding drug specimens,\ntesting, and test results of only ten specifically named Major\nLeague baseball players. The warrant also provided that if the\ncomputer data seized did not fall within any of the items to\nbe seized or is not otherwise legally seized, the government\nwould return the data. The affidavit provided by Special\nAgent Novitzky in support of the issuance of the warrants\nstated that obtaining information to link the test results to\nindividual players was necessary “to ensure that samples of\nindividuals not associated with Balco are left undisturbed.”\n\n   The warrant was issued one day after the motion to quash\nthe grand jury subpoena had been filed in the Northern Dis-\ntrict of California. Upon arrival at the premises of CDT on the\nmorning of the search, Special Agent Novitzky and other\nagents discussed with CDT’s attorney the need to search\nCDT’s computers.\n\n   The information sought in the search warrant was contained\nin three places: a segregated list only containing information\nabout the ten athletes that were subject of the search warrant;\na master list of the drug test results for all Major League\nBaseball players; and a computer directory (often referred to\nas the “Tracey directory”) that contained information and\nmedical test results for hundreds of other baseball players and\nathletes engaged in professional sports. Counsel for CDT\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING              19839\nrequested that all material pertaining to the specific items\nlisted in the warrant be reviewed and redacted by a magistrate\njudge or special master before it was seen by the government.\nThe government refused the request.2 The government also\nrejected CDT’s offer to provide the records it had already seg-\nregated concerning the small subset of players at issue.\n\n   In addition to the segregated materials, the government\nseized the master list, the entire Tracey Directory (which con-\nsisted of more than 2,900 files), lists of teams and players and\ndrug testing details, and eleven diskettes, all of which con-\ntained drug-test results on hundreds of Major League Baseball\nplayers and other athletes. The agents searching the Tracey\ndirectory at the scene concluded that certain of the subdirecto-\nries appeared to contain information not called for by the war-\nrant. Rather than copying only the subdirectories that\npertained to Major League Baseball, the agents copied the\nentire directory. In fact, the directory contained 2,911 files\nthat had nothing to do with Major League Baseball drug test-\ning, but rather contained test results for numerous other sports\nentities and business organizations. Dr. Jean Joseph of CDT\nlater stated in an affidavit that the directory was easily\nsearched by key word and would have provided the test infor-\nmation about the ten players in a short period of time.\n\n   Judge Cooper later specifically found that “[o]nce the items\nwere seized the requirement of the search warrant that any\nseized items not covered by the warrant be first screened and\nsegregated by computer personnel was completely ignored.”\nShe further found that Agent Novitzky himself reviewed the\nseized computer data and used what he learned to obtain the\nsubsequent search warrants issued in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, the Central District of California, and Nevada.\n  2\n    Department of Justice Guidelines provide that, in cases involving con-\nfidential patient information, a search warrant “shall be executed in such\na manner as to minimize, to the greatest extent practicable, scrutiny of\nconfidential materials.” 28 C.F.R. § 59.4(b)(4).\n\f19840   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n  After the initial search, and based on the search results, the\ngovernment sought and obtained that day a second search\nwarrant from Magistrate Judge Johnson for a search of a stor-\nage facility maintained by CDT.\n\n   On the same day, the government also applied for a search\nwarrant in the District of Nevada. The warrant sought infor-\nmation in the business files of Quest Diagnostics, Inc., a labo-\nratory that had also been involved in the administration of\nMajor League Baseball’s drug testing program in 2003. The\nwarrant was limited to information concerning the ten base-\nball players identified in the Los Angles search warrant. The\naffidavit filed in support of the warrant did not disclose the\nhistory of the issuance of the grand jury subpoena or the filing\nof a motion to quash the subpoena. Based on the information\nprovided by the government, Magistrate Judge Lawrence\nLeavitt issued the warrant, and the warrant was executed.\n\n   On April 9, 2004, the Players Association arranged an\nemergency hearing before Judge White, before whom the\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena was pending. The\nPlayers Association sought an order restricting the govern-\nment from disseminating any information it had obtained until\nthe Players Association had an opportunity to litigate the\nmotion to quash or a Rule 41 motion to return the seized prop-\nerty. The government argued that Judge White had no juris-\ndiction over the items seized pursuant to the search warrants,\neven though the grand jury subpoena sought the same materi-\nals.\n\n   The government represented to the court that it would not\ndisseminate the information and would negotiate in good faith\nabout the seized items. Judge White accepted that representa-\ntion. He noted that he did not have jurisdiction over the items\nseized pursuant to the warrants, but that the motions to quash\nthe grand jury subpoenas remained pending before him. Judge\nWhite acknowledged that the position of the Players Associa-\ntion was “well taken with respect to the U.S. Attorney’s man-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19841\nual and the government allegedly not following proper\nprocedure,” but that the Players Association had other avail-\nable remedies to resolve that issue on the merits.\n\n   On April 22, 2004, the government wrote CDT indicating\nthat it was withdrawing the January 16, 2004, subpoena and\nmodifying the subpoena of March 3, 2004. The government\ndid not inform Judge White of these actions and the January\n16 subpoena was never withdrawn.\n\n   On April 24, CDT and the Players Association filed a\nmotion in the Central District of California for return of the\nseized property or, in the alternative, appointment of a special\nmaster to redact those records so that the government retained\ndrug test results for only the ten players named in the warrant.\n\n   On April 30, 2004, the government filed its opposition to\nthe motion to return property in the Central District. In its\nopposition, despite the existence of an agreement with CDT\nthat CDT would not destroy or alter documents, the govern-\nment argued that it “had good-faith reasons to believe that\nCDT was detrimentally delaying the investigation, and that\nthere was some danger of the sought-after records being jeop-\nardized.” The government also argued that this jeopardy justi-\nfied proceeding with a search warrant under DOJ guidelines.\n\n  On the same date, April 30, 2004, based on what it had\nfound in the first search, the government sought a new search\nwarrant in the Northern District of California in San Jose for\nCDT electronic files it already had in its possession in the\nTracey Directory concerning all players whose test results\nwere positive.\n\n   In contrast to the affidavit supplied in the first warrant\napplication, which purported to “to ensure that samples of\nindividuals not associated with Balco are left undisturbed,”\nthe affidavit of Agent Novitzky in support of this warrant\napplication sought “authorization to conduct a thorough\n\f19842   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nreview of all major league baseball-related computer data”\nand “to seize all data pertaining to illegal drug use by any\nmember of major league baseball.”\n\fUNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING   19843\n                                    Volume 2 of 2\n\f19844   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n\n\n\n   The affidavit conceded that no specific information had\nbeen uncovered linking Balco to any individual baseball play-\ners beyond the ten listed in the April 7, 2004, search warrant.\nHowever, in contrast to the first warrant application, Agent\nNovitzky averred that even though there was no evidence that\nhad been developed to link the ballplayers who were not listed\nin the first warrant to Balco, “it is logical to assume that a\nreview of the drug testing records for other players may pro-\nvide additional evidence of the use of similar illegal\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19845\nperformance-enhancing drugs which establishes a link to the\ncharged defendants in the charged [Balco] case, given the rel-\natively small number of professional baseball players and the\nclosely-knit professional baseball community.”\n\n   The affidavit in support of issuance of the warrant did not\ndisclose that a grand jury subpoena had been issued for the\nsame material and that a motion to quash the subpoena was\npending in the very same district.\n\n   The affidavit also did not disclose that the parties were liti-\ngating in the Central District of California a motion for return\nof the seized property — the very property which was subject\nof the new search warrant request. Based on the information\nprovided by the government, Magistrate Judge Howard W.\nLloyd issued a new search warrant for the same material that\nthe government had already searched and seized.\n\n   On May 5, 2004, the government sought a search warrant\nin the District of Nevada for information contained in the files\nat Quest Diagnostics concerning all baseball players who,\naccording to the information collected in the CDT search, had\ntested positive for steroids. The application conceded that\nthere was no specific evidence linking these players to Balco.\nThe warrant was issued by Magistrate Judge Leavitt. A large\nnumber of physical samples of bodily fluids were taken (later\nreported by the government to be 250 to 300 because of mul-\ntiple samples given by the players), which the government\ntransported to a lab in Los Angeles.\n\n   On May 5, 2004, the government sought a search warrant\nin the Central District of California in Los Angeles before a\ndifferent magistrate judge for all information contained in the\nfiles at CDT concerning all baseball players who, according\nto the information collected in the CDT search, had a positive\nmarker for steroids. The application conceded that there was\nno specific evidence linking these players to Balco. Neither\nthe application nor the affidavit filed in support of the applica-\n\f19846   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ntion disclosed the pending proceedings concerning the grand\njury subpoenas. Based on the information provided by the\ngovernment, the warrant was issued by Magistrate Judge\nRosalyn Chapman.\n\n   On May 6, 2004, after it had executed the search warrants,\nthe government served grand jury subpoenas on CDT and\nQuest for the same materials it had sought in the April 30 and\nMay 5 search warrants. The subpoena contained the names of\nthe baseball players that had allegedly tested positive, even\nthough the government knew that the information Quest pos-\nsessed was only identifiable by number and even though the\ngovernment had assured the Players Association and Judge\nWhite that it would not disclose the names. The government\nsent a letter to Quest Diagnostics instructing the company not\nto disclose to anyone the government’s request for documents\n“indefinitely” because “[a]ny such disclosure could impede\nthe investigation being conducted and thereby interfere with\nthe enforcement of the law.”\n\n   On May 21, 2004, CDT and the Players Association filed\na motion in the District of Nevada for a return of the property\nseized from Quest Diagnostics. On June 7, 2004, CDT and the\nPlayers Association filed a motion in the Northern District of\nCalifornia for return of the electronic documents seized from\nCDT pursuant to the April 30 search warrant issued by Magis-\ntrate Judge Lloyd in the Northern District.\n\n   On July 9, 2004, Judge White held a hearing on the motion\nto quash the grand jury subpoenas, but deferred action pend-\ning rulings on the motions for return of property seized pursu-\nant to the search warrants.\n\n   On August 9, 2004, Judge Susan Illston held a hearing on\nthe motion for return of the electronic data seized by the gov-\nernment pursuant to the April 30 warrant. When asked by\nJudge Illston why the government hadn’t just waited to let\nJudge White rule on the motions to quash the grand jury sub-\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            19847\npoena rather than seeking search warrants for the same mate-\nrial, the government responded:\n\n      What the government really perceived ultimately as\n      a conscious decision on the part of the Major League\n      Baseball Players Association and the other parties\n      associated with it just refused to comply with what\n      the government felt was [sic] legitimate grand jury\n      subpoenas.\n\n   Later in the hearing the government argued that the search\nwarrant was necessary because a motion to quash had been\nfiled.\n\n      Counsel: The concern here was, to say, okay, we’re\n               going to face a brick wall from this legal\n               avenue . . . .\n\n      Judge:      What brick wall?\n\n      Counsel: The brick wall was . . .\n\n      Judge:      Judge White?\n\n      Counsel: No, no, not at all. It was the concern that\n               the requests or that discussions about\n               moving to quash the subpoena would be\n               something that would be dragged out.\n\n   At a later hearing, counsel for government confirmed that\nit would not have sought to obtain the search warrants if the\naffected parties had not filed a motion to quash the grand jury\nsubpoena.3 However, the Department of Justice Guidelines\n  3\n   A hearing on December 10, 2004, discussed infra, contains this collo-\nquy:\n      Counsel:   And the government never would have done the\n                 search warrants if the grand jury process could have\n\f19848    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nprovide that “The fact that the disinterested third party pos-\nsessing the materials may have grounds to challenge a sub-\npoena or other legal process is not in itself a legitimate basis\nfor the use of a search warrant.” 28 C.F.R. § 59.4.\n\n   The government primarily argued that, even though the\nmaterial seized may not have been authorized under the\nsearch warrant, seizure was appropriate under the “plain\nview” doctrine. The court engaged in an extensive colloquy\nabout the search, ascertaining that the data was contained in\na file that could not be accessed readily without assistance,\nand that the agent had to scroll through 1,200 results to obtain\nthe positive tests that formed the basis of the later search war-\nrants. After noting that the government had not provided any\ncase to support its contention that the plain view doctrine\napplied in the computer context, Judge Illston made the fol-\nlowing findings:\n\n    I find absolutely staggering the implications about\n    what you say about the plain view doctrine in the\n    computer set up. In a way nothing is in plain view\n    because with the disk you look at it, you don’t see\n    anything until you stick it in the computer and it\n    does take quite a lot of work really to bring it up on\n    the screen.\n\n              worked out. But it didn’t. I feel —\n   Court:     Say that last thing one more time. What you —\n   Counsel:   What I just said was we may not have ever done the\n              search warrants if the subpoena process worked out.\n   Court:     But, I mean, there was a subpoena process pending in\n              this building before Judge White.\n   Counsel:   Yes.\n   Court:     At the time you went and got your search warrants,\n              and you didn’t allow that process to complete itself.\n   Counsel:   That is true.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19849\n    So, it’s not in plain view in the sense of walking into\n    the room and seeing the scale on the desk. It takes\n    a whole lot of work to get there.\n\n    First off, none of it is cursory, there are whole indus-\n    tries that have developed in order to make it possible\n    for the disk to show up on the screen that way. So\n    it’s not cursory review. I don’t think it’s plain view.\n    I don’t think I have to go that far or make that kind\n    of choice with respect to issues that are certainly\n    going to arise. . . . Where it requires sorting through\n    information which really is on a data base, somehow\n    it’s being organized in different formats, you could\n    organize it in a format based on the ten names,\n    instead of taking it in other kinds of formats, then\n    scrolling across and taking names and information\n    off the screen, when it’s clearly information that\n    isn’t part of what was originally within the autho-\n    rized search warrant, I just think is impermissible.\n\n  Judge Illston then granted the motion for return of seized\nproperty, with the following findings from the bench:\n\n       So, having looked at the Ramsden factors set out,\n    [there are] apparently four factors. One, whether the\n    government displayed a callous disregard for the\n    constitutional rights, two, whether the [movant] has\n    an individual right and need for the property he\n    wants returned, three, whether the [movant] would\n    be irreparably injured by denying the motion for\n    return of property, and four, whether the [movant]\n    has an adequate remedy at law for a redress of his\n    grievance. I find all four factors have been met here.\n\n       I think the government has displayed, in the chro-\n    nology of things that we’ve seen, in the way that the\n    case was taken from one judge to another judge, in\n    the way that as soon as it was challenged in one\n\f19850   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    court, it was immediately litigated in another court\n    without full information being shared among the\n    courts, that to me makes it a callous disregard for\n    constitutional rights. I think, it’s a seizure beyond\n    what was authorized by the search warrant, therefore\n    it violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\n       Number two, I think [that both movants] here\n    have an interest and need for the property returned.\n    I think they need it returned and not so much\n    because they need it back, they got it, you got it, I\n    think what they need to get back from you what they\n    have, what you’ve taken from them because of the\n    privacy rights and the circumstances under which\n    this material was given.\n\n       Whether the [movant] would be irreparably\n    injured by denying the return of the property, I think\n    they would, and I think indeed there would be, that\n    the injury that will be suffered by volunteers not\n    being able to confidently provide testing under\n    promise of privacy would irreparably injure not only\n    major league baseball, I can’t imagine that there’s\n    going to be any voluntary agreement to do this kind\n    of testing, that’s probably over with already, but also\n    just has implications that are very negative for these\n    [movants], and whether the [movant] has an ade-\n    quate remedy at law, I don’t think there is any rem-\n    edy at law for the redress of these grievances.\n\n    I’m going to grant the motion.\n\n   On August 13, in the Central District of California, Magis-\ntrate Judge Johnson issued a report and recommendation rec-\nommending denial of the motion for return of property seized\nat CDT.\n\n On August 19, in the District of Nevada, Judge James C.\nMahan held a hearing on the motion filed by the Players\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19851\nAssociation for the return of the property seized at Quest\nDiagnostics pursuant to the search warrants. The government\ndid not disclose to Judge Mahan or the Players Association\nthat it had served on Quest a grand jury subpoena for the same\nmaterials, coupled with a letter instructing Quest to keep that\nfact confidential indefinitely. At the conclusion of the hearing,\nJudge Mahan orally granted the motion. On September 7,\nJudge Mahan filed a written order granting the motion for\nreturn of the property. Judge Mahan found, in relevant part,\nthat:\n\n    2.   Under Ramsden v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628126\"><a href=\"/opinion/628126/terence-philip-ramsden-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n         (9th Cir. 1993), this Court has equitable jurisdic-\n         tion to order return of that seized property. All\n         of the factors identified in Ramsden supporting\n         jurisdiction are present. The government cal-\n         lously disregarded the affected players’ constitu-\n         tional rights. The MLBPA, as representative for\n         the players, has an individual interest in and\n         need for the property that it wants returned. The\n         MLBPA would be irreparably injured if the\n         property were not returned. And the MLBPA\n         has no adequate remedy at law for redress of the\n         grievances.\n\n    3.   Under the particular circumstances of this case,\n         it was unreasonable for the Government to\n         refuse to follow the procedures set forth in\n         United States v. Tamura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n         1982), upon learning that drug-testing records\n         for the ten athletes named in the original April\n         8 warrants executed at Quest and at Comprehen-\n         sive Drug Testing, Inc. were co-mingled with\n         records for other athletes not named in those\n         warrants.\n\n   After issuance of the order, the government declined to\nreturn the material seized from Quest in Nevada, contending\n\f19852   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nit was entitled to retain it under the authority of the new May\n6 grand jury subpoena. To that end, the government filed a\nstay motion with Judge Mahan, arguing that it had a right to\nretain the data and samples based on the May 6 grand jury\nsubpoena, which had issued after the seizures of the material\nhad occurred. The government argued that Judge White was\nthe only judge who had jurisdiction to decide that issue. Judge\nMahan denied the stay motion. The government maintained\nthat the May 6 grand jury subpoenas independently authorized\nretention of the data and specimens; therefore, the Players\nAssociation and CDT filed a motion to quash the May 6 sub-\npoena in the Northern District of California.\n\n   On October 1, 2004, in the Central District of California,\nJudge Cooper declined to adopt Magistrate Judge Johnson’s\nrecommendation, and granted the motion for return of the\nseized CDT property. She noted that she joined “an appar-\nently ever increasing number of district judges who have held\nthat the Government’s execution of the Search Warrant at\nissue in this case demonstrated a callous disregard for the con-\nstitutional rights of the movants and their members.”\n\n  With respect to the Ramsden factors, Judge Cooper found:\n\n       All four considerations weigh in favor of the mov-\n    ing parties in this case. In assessing whether the gov-\n    ernment displayed a callous disregard for the rights\n    of the persons whose records were seized, it is\n    important to focus on the Ninth Circuit opinion in\n    United States v. Tamura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982). At\n    the time of the search, Tamura was certainly settled\n    law in the Circuit, and Tamura establishes a proce-\n    dure to be followed when documents to be seized are\n    intermingled with other documents. “. . . . [T]he\n    wholesale seizure for later detained examination of\n    records not described in a warrant is significantly\n    more intrusive, and has been characterized as ‘the\n    kind of investigatory dragnet that the fourth amend-\n\f    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19853\nment was designed to prevent.’[citation].” Id. at 595.\nTherefore, law enforcement officials are to seal and\nhold such intermingled documents “pending\napproval by a magistrate of a further search . . . .\nWholesale removal must be monitored by the judg-\nment of a neutral, detached magistrate.” Id. at 596.\nIt is particularly telling in this case that just such a\nprocedure was proposed to the Government at the\ntime of the search, and rejected.\n\n   Nor is the viewing of the seized files legitimized\nby the Plain View doctrine. Under the exception to\nthe warrant requirement, an officer may seize what\nhe plainly views, so long as he has a lawful right to\naccess the evidence itself and its incriminating char-\nacter is immediately apparent. Horton v. California,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112448\"><a href=\"/opinion/112448/horton-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136 (1990). Here, the agent did not\nhave a lawful right to access the computer records\nand diskettes, and, as evidence provided in connec-\ntion with the Motion reveals, the evidence observed\nis not necessarily incriminating. The Declaration of\nDr. Joseph states that the ingestion of nutritional\nsupplements can produce a “positive” test for ste-\nroids.\n\n   The Government demonstrated a callous disregard\nfor the rights of persons whose records were seized\nand searched outside the warrants.\n\n   The second consideration, whether the moving\nparty has an interest and need for return of the prop-\nerty, is easily answered. The athletes in question vol-\nuntarily submitted to urine testing for steroids, as\npart of an agreement that all results would remain\nconfidential and be used only for statistical analysis.\nTheir interest in privacy is obvious.\n\n  The third consideration, whether the moving party\nhas an interest and need for return of the property is\n\f19854   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    easily answered. The careers of these athletes could\n    be profoundly, negatively affected by release of\n    these records, and their return is vitally important.\n    The harm they would suffer if the records were\n    released (even if the positive tests are shown to be\n    innocuous) would be irreparable.\n\n       Finally, it is evident that the movants have no\n    other legal remedy. No motion to suppress the evi-\n    dence is available to them; they are neither defen-\n    dants nor suspects, and no case exists in which this\n    issue could be litigated.\n\n  In addition to her findings and conclusions, Judge Cooper\nadded these comments in a section labeled “Serious Con-\ncerns:”\n\n       The documents presented to the Court in connec-\n    tion with this Motion reveal extremely troubling\n    conduct on the part of the Government. The picture\n    painted is one of almost desperate effort to acquire\n    evidence by whatever means could be utilized. The\n    Government negotiated with movants’ attorneys\n    over the breadth of the grand jury subpoenas;\n    received assurances in writing that the records of the\n    ten athletes would be secured while the Court\n    resolved the issue, and the day after the issue was\n    presented to a Court, went to another district and\n    sought a search warrant. That conduct would be sus-\n    pect in itself. But in seeking the warrant (not the cor-\n    rect procedure for obtaining documents for a third\n    party who is not a suspect), the Government\n    explained to the Magistrate that the records in ques-\n    tion were in danger of being destroyed. This is bla-\n    tant misrepresentation, as demonstrated by the\n    records in this case.\n\n     Four days after Movants filed a motion before\n    Magistrate Judge Johnson for return of the property,\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING      19855\n    the Government obtained a further warrant from a\n    Magistrate Judge in the Northern District of Califor-\n    nia. And while a motion for return of that property\n    was pending, the Government obtained two more\n    warrants in the Central District of California (not\n    from Magistrate Judge Johnson) and in Nevada. The\n    image of quickly and skillfully moving the cup so no\n    one can find the pea would be humorous if the mat-\n    ter were not so serious.\n\n   Noting that “the Government is held to a far higher stan-\ndard than has been demonstrated in this case,” and that “this\nis the third District Court Order compelling the Government\nto return property illegally seized,” Judge Cooper ordered\nreturn of the seized CDT property forthwith.\n\n   On December 10, 2004, Judge Illston held a hearing on the\nPlayers Association motion to intervene and to quash the May\n6, 2004 grand jury subpoenas served on CDT and Quest. At\nthe conclusion of the hearing, Judge Illston made the follow-\ning oral findings and conclusions:\n\n       I find that the MLBPA has the right to intervene\n    in this matter under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n    24(a), as it has an interest in the samples and test\n    results in the possession of CDT and Quest, which\n    were created with the promise of anonymity under\n    the mandatory testing of the 2002 collective bargain-\n    ing agreement.\n\n       The May 6th, 2004 subpoenas were the culmina-\n    tion of a series of actions taken by the government\n    in order to prevent MLBPA and CDT’s attempt to\n    move to quash the January and March subpoenas.\n    Instead of allowing the matter to be resolved in a sin-\n    gle proceeding before Judge White, the government\n    executed a series of search warrants in three different\n\f19856   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    districts once it learned that petitioners would move\n    to quash the January and March subpoenas.\n\n       The government has provided no substantial\n    explanation of why this course of action was neces-\n    sary. Given that the government had no other basis\n    for issuing the April search warrants and preempting\n    the subpoenas served of Quest and CDT, the deci-\n    sion appears to have been a tactical decision to pre-\n    vent the parties from raising objections before Judge\n    White, which is unreasonable and constitutes harass-\n    ment similar to the conduct in United States v. Amer-\n    ican Honda.\n\n       Furthermore, the May 6th subpoenas were served\n    after the government had obtained evidence pursuant\n    to the April 7 and April 30 search warrants, which\n    has now been determined to have been illegally\n    seized. Some of the information sought in the May\n    6th subpoena was already in the government’s pos-\n    session at the time the subpoena was served on CDT\n    and Quest; therefore, the Court finds that the May\n    6th subpoena served as an unreasonable insurance\n    policy as recognized in the motion for the return of\n    seized property cited in the papers, 681 F.Supp. [sic]\n\n      For these reasons the court grants petitioner’s\n    motion to quash the May 6th subpoena served on\n    Quest and CDT as an abuse of the grand jury process\n    and unreasonable under Federal Rule of Criminal\n    Procedure 17(c).\n\n   On October 18, 2005, as a result of a plea agreement, Balco\nfounder Victor Conte received a sentence of eight months\nimprisonment, with four months of the sentence to be served\nin home confinement. James Valente, Balco’s vice president,\nwas sentenced to probation. Trainer Greg Anderson was sen-\ntenced to six months imprisonment, with three of the six\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19857\nmonths to be spent in home confinement. On February 25,\n2006, track coach Remi Korchemny was sentenced to one\nyear of probation.\n\n   In reviewing both the order quashing the grand jury sub-\npoena and the orders granting the motions for return of prop-\nerty pursuant to Fed.

For\nthe same reasons—although the majority does not reach this\nissue—I would also hold that the Players Association had\norganizational standing to file the Rule 41(g) motion for\nreturn of the property seized from CDT.\n\n   However, I respectfully disagree that the government\ntimely appealed Judge Cooper’s order granting the motion for\nreturn of property.\n\f19858    UNITED STATES v.

The Players Association contends that\nwe lack jurisdiction due to the government’s untimely filing.\nThe government contends that the time for filing an appeal\nwas tolled by its filing of a “Motion for Reconsideration” with\nthe district court.\n\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not provide for\n“Motions for Reconsideration.” Rather, such motions are\ncreatures of local rule or practice. In this case, the govern-\nment’s motion was filed pursuant to Local Rule 7-18 of the\nCentral District of California. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n83 authorizes district courts to make rules governing their\nown practices so long as they are “not inconsistent with [the\nFederal Rules].” Where a conflict arises between the two, fed-\neral rules must prevail.

Because the government’s motion to reconsider was\n\f         UNITED STATES v.

Graham Red Squirrel, 954 F.2d\nat 1463 n.35.\n\n   For these reasons, I disagree with the analysis offered by\nthe parties and by the majority. The government’s argument\nthat “courts liberally construe post-judgment motions as ade-\nquate to toll the time for filing a notice of appeal” is squarely\nforeclosed by circuit law under these circumstances. The\ncases cited by the government pertain only to motions timely\nfiled within the ten day period described in Rule 59(e), not to\nmotions filed outside the ten day window.

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   To summarize: Consistent with our precedent and the rules,\nI would hold that the government’s untimely motion for\nreconsideration should be construed as a Rule 60(b) motion.\nBecause the government did not file a notice of appeal of the\noriginal order within the period required by Rule 4(a)(1)(B),\nwe lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the original\norder. I would hold that we have jurisdiction to consider the\ndistrict court’s denial of the motion for reconsideration, but\nour review is confined to it.\n\n                              B\n\n   We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration con-\nstrued as a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion, Sch.\nDist.

Therefore, our review is\nconfined to whether Judge Cooper abused her discretion in\ndenying the government’s motion for reconsideration and\ndoes not extend to the merits of the underlying order.\n\n   When we review a motion for reconsideration under Rule\n60(b), we analyze the district court’s decision under the usual\nRule 60(b) factors, “which provide[ ] for reconsideration only\nupon a showing of (1) mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect;\n(2) newly discovered evidence; (3) fraud; (4) avoid judgment;\n(5) a satisfied or discharged judgment; or (6) ‘extraordinary\ncircumstances’ which would justify relief.” Fuller, 950 F.2d\nat 1442. In its reconsideration motion, the government did not\ncontend there was any mistake, surprise, excusable neglect,\nnewly discovered evidence, fraud, void judgment, satisfied or\ndischarged judgment, or extraordinary circumstances. Rather,\nthe government simply asked the district court to modify its\nfinding, suggesting that the court had failed to consider evi-\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19863\ndence already in the record. A district court does not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying a Rule 60(b) motion when it simply\nrepeats its earlier arguments. Backlund v. Barnhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461648\"><a href=\"/opinion/461648/william-backlund-and-patricia-backlund-his-wife-amy-backlund-a-minor/\"><span class=\"volume\">778</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1388 (9th Cir. 1985).\n\n   In response to the government’s motion, the district court\nexamined each of the government’s assertions that the court\nhad ignored evidence and arguments. In its order denying\nreconsideration, the district court carefully explained how it\nhad considered the evidence and arguments in the first\ninstance, but found them unconvincing. As the district court\nproperly concluded, the motion for reconsideration amounted\nonly to “[t]he Government’s mere disagreement with the\nCourt’s interpretation of the evidence and its opinions . . . .”\nUnder these circumstances, the district court certainly did not\nabuse its discretion in denying the government’s motion.6 I\nwould affirm the order of the district court denying the gov-\nernment’s motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                    III\n\n  I agree with the majority that the district courts properly\nexercised equitable jurisdiction over the Rule 41(g) motions.7\n   6\n     The local rule under which the motion was filed contains similar\nrestrictions to those contained in Rule 60(b). It provides that “[a] motion\nfor reconsideration on any motion may be made only on the grounds of\n(a) a material difference in law or fact from that presented to the Court\nbefore such decision that in the exercise of reasonable diligence could not\nhave been known to the party moving for reconsideration at the time of\nsuch decision, or (b) the emergence of new material factors or a change\nof law occurring after the time of such decision, or (c) a manifest showing\nof a failure to consider material facts presented to the Court before such\ndecision.” Local Rule 7-18. Clearly, the government offered no new evi-\ndence that was not available to it at the time the motion was made and no\nsuggestion of a change in law. Its only argument was that the district court\nfailed to consider material facts already presented, a contention that the\ndistrict court squarely addressed in its order.\n   7\n     For the purposes of this section, I will analyze Judge Cooper’s order\ngranting Rule 41(g) relief on the merits along with Judge Mahan’s similar\norder, even though I believe that we lack jurisdiction to consider the mer-\nits of Judge Cooper’s original order as I explained in Section II.\n\f19864    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nRamsden identified four factors that district courts must con-\nsider before exercising equitable jurisdiction to order the\nreturn of property, namely whether: (1) the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant; (2) the movant has an individual interest in and the\nneed for the property he wants returned; (3) the movant would\nbe irreparably injured by denying return of the property; and\n(4) the movant has an adequate remedy at law for the redress\nof his grievance. 2 F.3d at 324.\n\n   Although I agree with the majority that the district courts\nproperly exercised equitable jurisdiction, I disagree with the\nmajority’s analysis in reaching that conclusion. Because the\nequitable jurisdictional analysis in large part drives the analy-\nsis of the merits of the Rule 41(g) decisions, it is important\nto detail my differences with the majority on the issue.\n\n                               A\n\n   The first Ramsden factor is whether the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant. The majority concludes the government did not. I\nrespectfully disagree with that conclusion. The record amply\nsupports the conclusion of the district courts that the govern-\nment displayed callous disregard for the constitutional rights\nof the movants.\n\n                               1\n\n   The district judges concluded, among other things, that the\ngovernment sought and executed the search warrants and took\nsubsequent legal action as a tactical measure to prevent the\nPlayers Association and CDT from litigating their motion to\nquash and other objections to the wholesale production of\nCDT data. The record supports this conclusion. The govern-\nment applied for, and executed, the initial search warrants\nafter CDT and the Players Association informed the govern-\nment it would be filing a motion to quash the grand jury sub-\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19865\npoenas. Government counsel conceded on the record that the\nmotivation for seeking the search warrants was the “brick\nwall” presented by the filing of the motions to quash, even\nthough DOJ guidelines state that “[t]he fact that the disinter-\nested third party possessing the materials may have grounds\nto challenge a subpoena or other legal process is not in itself\na legitimate basis for the use of a search warrant.” 28 C.F.R.\n§ 59.4.\n\n   The majority repeatedly points out that the DOJ guidelines\ndo not give rise to substantive rights. That may be so, but it\nis beside the point. The guidelines form a baseline from which\nto judge the reasonableness of unjustified deviations from the\nstandard practices they outline. The guidelines plainly state\nthat it is not legitimate to use a search warrant because a party\nmay be challenging a subpoena; the government admitted that\nthis was precisely the reason it issued the warrants in this\ncase.\n\n   Further, as Judge Cooper found, the use of a search warrant\nto obtain documents from a third party is inappropriate. The\nDepartment of Justice Guidelines address this point specifi-\ncally:\n\n    A search warrant should not be used to obtain docu-\n    mentary materials believed to be in the private pos-\n    session of a disinterested third party unless it appears\n    that the use of a subpoena, summons, request, or\n    other less intrusive alternative means of obtaining\n    the materials would substantially jeopardize the\n    availability or usefulness of the materials sought, and\n    the application for the warrant has been authorized\n    as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n28 C.F.R. § 59.4(a)(1); see also U.S. Attorney’s Manual § 9-\n19.210.\n\f19866     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n  The U.S. Attorney’s Manual also provides that a search\nwarrant should normally not be used to obtain confidential\nmaterials such as treatment records. §§ 9-19.220, 9-19.230.\n\n   The simple and undisputed fact is that the government\ndeviated from its usual and appropriate protocol. Documents\nheld in the possession of third parties are appropriately\nobtained through use of grand jury subpoena, not search war-\nrant. The record is quite clear that the government used the\nvehicle of a search warrant only because it thought its grand\njury subpoenas might be contested. As the DOJ Guidelines\nrecognize, that is an inappropriate use of a search warrant.\nThe district judges were entitled on the basis of the record to\nfind that the government undertook this action in an attempt\nto prevent the Players Association and CDT from litigating\nthe merits of their objections to the grand jury subpoenas.\n\n   Further, the entire record of the case shows a repeated pat-\ntern of the government attempting to prevent a full hearing on\nthe merits of the Players Association legal challenges. In vir-\ntually each hearing in which CDT and the Players Association\narticulated their objections, the government argued that\nanother court had primary jurisdiction or that the action of\nanother court dictated the result.8 The record supports the dis-\ntrict courts’ collective conclusion that, as Judge Cooper put it,\nthe government’s actions constituted a “desperate effort to\n  8\n    To provide but a few examples: Before Judge White, who was consid-\nering the initial motion to quash, the government argued that he should\ndefer ruling because he had no jurisdiction over the materials seized by the\nwarrant. The government urged Judge Illston to wait to decide the Rule\n41(g) motion until Magistrate Judge Johnson had ruled on the separate\nRule 41(g) motion. The government urged Judge Johnson to consider that\nprobable cause had already been established by the issuance of a search\nwarrant by Magistrate Judge Lloyd. The government contended Judge\nMahan lacked jurisdiction to order the property seized under the warrant\nreturned because it had separately obtained a grand jury subpoena for the\nsame item, urging him to wait until Judge White had ruled on the motion\nto quash (not disclosing that it had asked Judge White to defer until the\nRule 41(g) motions had been decided).\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING      19867\nacquire evidence by whatever means could be utilized,” by\nmeans of “quickly and skillfully moving the cup so no one\ncan find the pea.”\n\n                              2\n\n   The record also amply supports the conclusion of the dis-\ntrict courts that the government made misleading statements\nin its application for search warrants.\n\n   The application contained lengthy representations about\nhow computer data could be destroyed and stated that “while\nnot denying that they have the requested materials, CDT has\ndeclined to comply with the subpoena and has stated its intent\nto quash the subpoena.” The affidavit did not disclose that\nCDT had agreed in writing to keep the data and other materi-\nals secured until the scope of the grand jury subpoena was set-\ntled, either through negotiation or a ruling on a motion to\nquash. The affidavit did not disclose that the Chief of the\nCriminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office had\naccepted the assurances in writing.\n\n  Rather, the affidavit justified removing computer data and\nequipment from the searched premises on the basis that:\n\n    Computer users can attempt to conceal data within\n    computer equipment and storage devices through a\n    number of methods, including the use of innocuous\n    or misleading filenames and extensions. . . . Com-\n    puter users can also attempt to conceal data by using\n    encryption, which means that a password or device,\n    such as a “dongle” or “keycard,” is necessary to\n    decrypt the data into readable form. In addition,\n    computer users can conceal data within another\n    seemingly unrelated and innocuous file in a process\n    called “steganography.” For example, by using ste-\n    ganography, a computer user can conceal text in an\n    image file which cannot be viewed when the image\n\f19868    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    file is opened. Therefore, a substantial amount of\n    time is necessary to extract and sort through data that\n    is concealed or encrypted to determine whether it is\n    evidence, contraband or instrumentalities of a crime.\n\n   The affidavit also informed the magistrate judge that\n“[c]omputer hardware and storage devices may contain\n‘booby traps’ that destroy or alter data if certain procedures\nare not scrupulously followed.” It noted that computer data\nwas “particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nmodification or destruction.”\n\n   The government did not have any evidence or reason to\nbelieve that CDT had engaged in steganography, booby-\ntrapping computers, or any type of data destruction or alter-\nation. To the contrary, it had accepted in writing CDT’s assur-\nances “that CDT will maintain and preserve all materials\ncalled for by the first subpoena as well as any materials called\nfor by the new subpoena” and that “CDT would not destroy\nor alter any of the materials called for by either of the subpoe-\nnas.” The plain import of the application was that CDT was\nimproperly resisting compliance with a valid grand jury sub-\npoena and data was in jeopardy of being destroyed. It implied\nthat CDT was not being forthright about the information it\npossessed, when in fact there was no suggestion that CDT\nwas attempting to mislead the government in any respect.\n\n   The search warrant application did not disclose that the\nPlayers Association, on behalf of the individuals whose medi-\ncal files were at issue, had intervened and had joined CDT’s\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena. The application did\nnot disclose the history of negotiations between the parties,\nand that the concern was about the breadth of the subpoena.\nThe application did not disclose that the written assurances\nmade by CDT and accepted by the government contemplated\nresolving the disputed issues through a motion to quash if\nnecessary. Rather, the application implied that CDT was tak-\ning unjustified unilateral action.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19869\n   Given these undisputed facts, the district judges were enti-\ntled to find that the government had made misleading state-\nments in the search warrant applications.\n\n                               3\n\n   The record amply supports that finding that the actions of\nthe government in executing the search warrants were a mere\npretext for inappropriately obtaining confidential medical data\nabout Major League Baseball players who were not under any\nparticularized suspicion of criminal activity. The government\nfirst sought the information about all Major League Baseball\nplayers in its initial grand jury subpoena. After objection from\nthe Players Association and CDT, the government (without\nwithdrawing its initial subpoena) issued a new subpoena lim-\nited to information about players about whom the government\nhad a reasonable suspicion were connected to Balco.\n\n   The initial search warrant purported to be limited to the\nplayers associated with Balco. Indeed, the affidavit purported\nto justify obtaining information to link test results to individ-\nual players “to ensure that samples of individuals not associ-\nated with Balco are left undisturbed.” However, once it had\ntaken all of the data off site, it proceeded with new warrants\nto search the data it already possessed for evidence of positive\nsteroid markers. There was no evidence in the exhaustive\nBalco investigation that any of these players had any connec-\ntion to Balco, as the government concedes.\n\n   When the entire record is examined, it appears that the gov-\nernment was attempting to obtain all medical data about all\nMajor League Baseball players, and using the search warrant\nfor the limited number of players as a pretext for doing so.\nThe procedure employed by the government at the search but-\ntresses this conclusion. CDT had segregated the information\nabout the ballplayers who were the subject of the search war-\nrant. However, the agents insisted on taking the entire direc-\ntory of information about all players. To the extent the data\n\f19870   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nresponsive to the warrant had not been provided in the segre-\ngated material, the information could have easily been iso-\nlated on site. Yet the government insisted on removing the\nentire directory.\n\n   CDT suggested using the Tamura procedure, under which\na magistrate judge would first examine the data and segregate\nthe non-confidential material. However, the government\nrejected that approach. Instead, the government seized every-\nthing, then examined it, then sought additional search war-\nrants as protection against its unauthorized search.\n\n   These facts, among many others from the record, more than\nadequately support the conclusion that the government used\nthe limited warrants as a pretext for conducting an unautho-\nrized general search—a tactic we rejected in United States v.\nRettig, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1978).\n\n                               4\n\n   The majority finally justifies the government’s actions by\nconcluding that the government had the right to seize all of\nthe medical data because the data was “intermingled” with\ndata responsive to the warrant. This conclusion is the one with\nwhich I have the most profound disagreement with the major-\nity.\n\n   There is no doubt that the agents did not comply with the\nwarrant. They seized an enormous amount of personal prop-\nerty belonging to individuals not under any suspicion of crim-\ninal activity. A warrantless search is, of course, presumptively\nunreasonable.

(quotation marks and cita-\n    tions omitted).\n\n   The government concedes that it had no probable cause or\neven particularized reasonable suspicion that could have\nformed the basis for the issuance of a search warrant to obtain\nthe physical samples, and the data obtained from testing the\nsamples, concerning the players who were not involved in the\nBalco investigation. The government’s particularized warrants\nwere limited to ten identified players whom the government\nalleged it had reason to believe were involved with Balco.\n\n   The majority endorses the warrantless seizure and search of\nconfidential medical information pertaining to individuals not\nunder any criminal suspicion, reasoning that the existence of\na handful of relevant records justifies the seizure and subse-\nquent search of thousands of irrelevant records. I respectfully\ndisagree.\n\n   The majority’s holding squarely conflicts with our prior\nprecedent. For decades, we have eschewed the indiscriminate\nsearch and seizure of materials that are not responsive to a\nvalid search warrant. In Tamura, we stated that “the whole-\nsale seizure for later detailed examination of records not\ndescribed in a warrant . . . has been characterized as ‘the kind\nof investigatory dragnet that the fourth amendment was\ndesigned to prevent.’ ” 694 F.2d at 595 (quoting United States\nv.

Cal.\n2004) (Kozinski, J., sitting by designation).\n\n   Here, it was clear to the investigating officers that they\nwere seizing a sizable amount of data that was not responsive\nto the warrant. Indeed, the Tracey directory itself was deter-\nmined to contain 2,911 files, with an unknown amount of data\nin each file, that were not connected with Major League Base-\nball player drug testing at all. The directory contained test\nresults for thirteen other sports organizations, two business\nentities, and three sports competitions. The sub-directories\nwere quite clearly named, so that it was obvious to the casual\nobserver that if the files in the directories correlated to the\nname—and there was no reason to think otherwise—the mate-\nrial had nothing to do with the ten players listed in the war-\nrant. In the files that concerned Major League Baseball\nplayers, there was information on approximately 1,200 play-\ners, with multiple test results.9\n\n   The majority relies on United States v. Beusch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"365597\"><a href=\"/opinion/365597/united-states-v-willi-beusch-and-deak-company-of-california-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1979), to establish that the government’s seizure\nof the entire Tracey directory was reasonable. However, as\nthe majority acknowledges, this court “limited the reach of\nBeusch’s holding to ‘single files and single ledgers, i.e., single\nitems which, though theoretically separable, in fact constitute\none volume or file folder.’ ”\n  9\n    The majority tries to distinguish what the agents did here from what\ntranspired in Tamura by stating that, here, the agents took only a copy of\nthe Tracey Directory and not the master files as was the case in Tamura.\nYet when the countervailing interest is privacy and not merely the disrup-\ntion of business, that interest suffers whether it is copies or originals that\nare seized. The majority also points out that the agents here did not take\nthe whole computer or all of the computers in CDT’s office. This distinc-\ntion fails to recognize the difference between the computer age and the\npaper age. All of the files in one directory on one computer in today’s\nworld could very well constitute the equivalent of all the files in an entire\noffice in yesterday’s paper era.\n\f            UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           19873\n   Here, the government seized the entire Tracey directory,\nnot only the individual spreadsheet containing the Major\nLeague Baseball players’ test results. In Beusch, we specifi-\ncally stated that “[t]he reasons we have given for allowing\ntheir seizure may not apply to sets of ledgers or files . . . .”\n596 F.2d at 877. On many computers, all of a user’s docu-\nments are found in a single directory. To apply Beusch to the\ncomputer context in the way the majority suggests would per-\nmit the government to seize all the documents on a given\ncomputer if only one document therein was responsive to the\nwarrant. This is precisely what Beusch explicitly said it did\nnot intend to permit in the paper documents context.\n\n   The majority’s holding that the government was entitled to\nseize all records in the file because the non-Balco drug test\nresults were “intermingled” in the same file puts Americans’\nmost basic privacy interests in jeopardy. Such a rule would\nentitle the government to seize the medical records of anyone\nwho had the misfortune of visiting a hospital or belonging to\na health care provider that kept patient records in any sort of\nmaster file which also contained the data of a person whose\ninformation was subject to a search warrant. I agree entirely\nwith Judge Illston’s observation that the implications of\napproving such behavior are staggering. Under the majority’s\nholding, no laboratory or hospital or health care facility could\nguarantee the confidentiality of records.\n\n  The majority attempts to discount this possibility, but offers\nno principled reason why it does not apply in hundreds of\nother contexts. Indeed, under questioning from the district\njudges, the government did not discount the possibility of\nother widespread searches.10\n  10\n     For example, a hearing before Magistrate Judge Johnson contained the\nfollowing colloquy between government counsel and the Court:\n       Court:   * * * If there is some other drug testing lab apart\n                from CDT, would you ever use — but the test for the\n                ten were at CDT.

Based on the theory that it’s sys-\n                 temic. And so there’s a problem, there’s a problem.\n                 And we know that these other labs test athletes, too.\n                 So can you just go search?\n    Counsel:     Yes, your honor.\n   Similarly, in another hearing Judge Illston asked government counsel\nwhether he thought it was possible to take the information from the Tracey\ndirectory concerning other sports organizations and use individual test\nresults of athletes to launch another investigation. Strikingly, Judge Illston\nposed it as a hypothetical, but the government did not appear to deny that\nofficers may have viewed individual records in other sports:\n    Court:       What if hockey had a subdirectory that had positive\n                 results and he clicked on it to make sure it was what\n                 it said it was, by George, that’s what it was, what\n                 about that?\n    Counsel:     I don’t know in checking to make sure it was hockey\n                 that didn’t happen. If it did happen, I would think that\n                 theoretically Agent Novitsky would have the right to\n                 either request a search warrant or, I suppose, if you\n                 looked at it enough, it’s possible that it was obvious,\n                 it was plain view, it was other drug use by hockey\n                 players. So there might be a legal entitlement for\n                 Agent Novitzsky to use that and do something with\n                 it. It hasn’t happened in this case. I suppose that’s\n                 theoretically possible, again, you would have, I\n                 believe, probable cause to believe that evidence in\n                 there would lead to other persons potentially involved\n                 in disputable criminal drugs, which is the crime that’s\n                 under investigation.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        19875\n    The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment cate-\n    gorically prohibits the issuance of any warrant\n    except one “particularly describing the place to be\n    searched and the persons or things to be seized.” The\n    manifest purpose of this particularity requirement\n    was to prevent general searches. By limiting the\n    authorization to search to the specific areas and\n    things for which there is probable cause to search,\n    the requirement ensures that the search will be care-\n    fully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on\n    the character of the wide-ranging exploratory\n    searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\n\n   Unfortunately, the majority’s theory—as well as the\ngovernment’s—causes just this type of result. The more sensi-\nble theory with respect to electronic data is to enforce the pro-\ncedure outlined in Tamura and require that a neutral\nmagistrate examine the co-mingled data that the government\nproposes to seize to make sure that private information that\nthe government is not authorized to see remains private.\nAgents who expect to encounter intermingled data or who\nunexpectedly encounter it may not review the data unabated,\nbut must seek a magistrate’s guidance on how to proceed.\nThis procedure need not impose impossible burdens on law\nenforcement. After seizure, the data is secure and may be\nreviewed in an “informed and deliberate” manner by a “neu-\ntral and detached” magistrate, rather than being secreted for\nindiscriminate examination by government officials.\n\n  Tamura described a procedure that would impose a check\non the government’s ability to engage in such behavior. We\nadvised that where “documents are so intermingled that they\ncannot be feasibly sorted on site,” that law enforcement offi-\ncers should “seal[ ] and hold[ ] the documents pending\napproval by a magistrate . . . .” Id. at 595-96. As we noted:\n\n    The essential safeguard required is that wholesale\n    removal must be monitored by the judgment of a\n\f19876       UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n       neutral, detached magistrate. In the absence of an\n       exercise of such judgment prior to the seizure in the\n       present case, it appears to us that the seizure, even\n       though convenient under the circumstances, was\n       unreasonable.\n\nId. at 596 (footnote omitted).11\n\n   The majority overrules the Tamura procedure, allowing the\ngovernment to search and seize documents without prior mag-\nistrate approval. This holding conflicts with Tamura.\n\n   Therefore, I respectfully disagree with the majority’s asser-\ntion that the government’s action in this case complied with\nthe Fourth Amendment, and that the procedures outlined in\nTamura should be rejected. There is no doubt that the agents\nviolated the terms of the search warrant.\n\n                                      5\n\n   The government did not advocate the position adopted by\nthe majority. The government’s sole justification for the war-\nrantless seizure of the data of the unlisted players is that it was\nin “plain view,” which is one of the limited exceptions to the\nFourth Amendment’s warrant requirement. Although the\nmajority did not reach this question, the theory formed the\nentire basis for the government’s legal justification for its\nactions and was the primary focus of the proceedings before\nthe district courts. Therefore, it is important to address it to\n  11\n   The Tenth Circuit adopted the Tamura approach specifically in the\ncomputer context in Carey, holding that:\n       Where officers come across relevant documents so intermingled\n       with irrelevant documents that they cannot feasibly be sorted at\n       the site, the officers may seal or hold the documents pending\n       approval by a magistrate of the conditions and limitations on a\n       further search through the documents.\n172 F.3d at 1275.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19877\ndemonstrate the soundness of the various decisions by the dis-\ntrict courts.\n\n   The plain view doctrine is based on the assumption that if\nthere is probable cause for the search, and the officer is\nlegally entitled to be at the premises under the Fourth Amend-\nment, seizure of an object in plain view that is contraband or\nevidence of a crime does not involve an invasion of privacy.\nPayton, 445 U.S. at 586-87. The Supreme Court has identified\nseveral conditions that must be satisfied before a plain view\nseizure of an object is upheld: (1) the officer conducting the\nseizure must lawfully arrive at the position from which the\nobject is plainly seen; (2) the object must be in plain view; (3)\nthe object’s incriminating character must be “immediately\napparent,” that is, the officer must have probable cause to\nbelieve the object is contraband or evidence of a crime; and\n(4) the officer must have a lawful right of access to the object\nitself.

After an extensive colloquy, Judge Illston con-\ncluded that the computer data seized was not in “plain view.”\nNot only is this factual conclusion not clearly erroneous, the\nundisputed record completely supports her conclusion under\nany standard of review.\n\f19878   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   As Judge Illston pointed out, this was not a case in which\nan incriminating photo or similar evidence could be viewed\non a computer screen; rather, at best, it involved scrolling\nthrough thousands of records none of which were immedi-\nately visible. In its application for a search warrant, the gov-\nernment justified removal of data and computer equipment on\nthe basis that:\n\n    The volume of data stored on many computer sys-\n    tems and storage devices will typically be so large\n    that it will be highly impractical to search for data\n    during the execution of the physical search of the\n    premises. A single megabyte of storage space is the\n    equivalent of 500 double-spaced pages of text. A\n    single gigabyte of storage space, or 1,000\n    megabytes, is the equivalent of 500,000 double-\n    spaced pages of text. Storage devices capable of\n    storing fifteen gigabytes of data are now common-\n    place in desktop computers. Consequently, each non-\n    networked desktop computer found during a search\n    can easily contain the equivalent of 7.5 million pages\n    of data, which, if printed out, would completely fill\n    a 10′ x 12′ x 10′ room to the ceiling.\n\n  The government also indicated in its affidavit that it would\nbe using consulting computer specialists to analyze the data.\nThe affidavit explained:\n\n    Searching computer systems is highly technical pro-\n    cess which requires specific expertise and special-\n    ized equipment. There are so many types of\n    computer hardware and software in use today that it\n    is impractical to bring to the search site all of the\n    necessary technical manuals and specialized equip-\n    ment to conduct a thorough search. In addition, it\n    may also be necessary to consult with computer per-\n    sonnel who have specific expertise in the type of\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING      19879\n    computer software application or operating system\n    that is being searched.\n\n   According to the government, the search of the computers\nat CDT could not be completed at the scene. There were, in\nfact, 16 computers. However, one computer was eventually\nisolated and data retrieved. As Special Agent Novitsky’s\nmemorandum of activity stated:\n\n    At approximately 2:35 p.m., S/A Abboud began\n    working on a computer with [a CDT employee].\n    [She] directed us to a computer in the office labeled\n    “E” for purposes of the search warrant and sketch.\n    At this computer, [she] identified a sub-directory\n    entitled “Tracey”, which she said contained all of the\n    computer documents for CDT’s sports drug testing\n    division. A cursory review of the subdirectory indi-\n    cated multiple further subdirectories and several\n    hundred computer files. As authorized by the war-\n    rant, because of the length of time it would take to\n    search each file and the intrusiveness it would cause\n    on CDT, it was decided to make a complete copy of\n    the “Tracey” subdirectory in order to perform a\n    search of it in the IRS-CID offices at a later time.\n\n   Agent Novitsky later explained in a subsequent affidavit\nthat:\n\n    This subdirectory contained hundreds of files and a\n    significant amount of computer data. After consult-\n    ing with agents at the scene specifically trained in\n    the search of computers, we determined that we\n    could not realistically search the entire directory on-\n    site in a reasonable amount of time. We therefore\n    made the determination to copy the entire sub-\n    directory.\n\n  After it was examined, the Tracey directory itself was\ndetermined to contain 2,911 files, with an unknown amount\n\f19880   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nof data in each file, that were not connected with Major\nLeague Baseball player drug testing at all. In the files that\nconcerned Major League Baseball players, there was informa-\ntion on approximately 1,200 players, with multiple test\nresults.\n\n   Given these circumstances, the data seized cannot be con-\nsidered to be in “plain view.” As the Supreme Court has\nnoted, “If, however, the police lack probable cause to believe\nthat an object in plain view is contraband without conducting\nsome further search of the object — i.e., if its incriminating\ncharacter is not immediately apparent, the plain view doctrine\ncannot justify its seizure.” Dickerson, 508 U.S. at 375 (alter-\nations and quotations omitted). The data now sought by the\ngovernment was not “obvious to the senses” at the scene, nor\nwere the positive tests in “plain view” from a glance at a com-\nputer screen. The data required analysis and thorough exami-\nnation off-site before the data at issue was discovered.\n\n   The “plain view” doctrine is inapplicable in the general\nelectronic context because it is at complete odds with the\nunderlying theory of the doctrine. As the Supreme Court has\nexplained:\n\n    The theory of that doctrine consists of extending to\n    nonpublic places such as the home, where searches\n    and seizures without a warrant are presumptively\n    unreasonable, the police’s longstanding authority to\n    make warrantless seizures in public places of such\n    objects as weapons and contraband. And the practi-\n    cal justification for that extension is the desirability\n    of sparing police, whose viewing of the object in the\n    course of a lawful search is as legitimate as it would\n    have been in a public place, the inconvenience and\n    risk—to themselves or to preservation of the\n    evidence—of going to obtain a warrant.\n\nHorton, 480 U.S. at 326-27 (internal citations omitted).\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19881\n   Neither of those considerations is present when we consider\nthe off-site examination of electronic data. As the government\nessentially acknowledged in its search warrant applications,\nexamination of computer data is a forensic exercise. It neces-\nsarily involves the application of software to interpret the\ndata; without external software aid, the data would appear\nonly as binary numbers. In addition, as in this case, the gov-\nernment often requires computer specialists to decipher the\ndata. Electronic data is simply not the kind of evidence that\nforms a natural extension of an officer’s discovery of obvious\ncontraband in a public place. The fact that further careful\nelectronic assistance is required outside the searched premises\nto interpret the data belies the “practical” justification that\nthere is insufficient time to obtain a warrant. Indeed, electron-\nically assisted searches of binary numbers bear a closer\nresemblance to the thermal imaging searches of homes that\nthe Supreme Court rejected as violative of the Fourth Amend-\nment in Kyllo v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118443\"><a href=\"/opinion/118443/kyllo-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001).\n\n  The ultimate fact that, after the assistance of electronic soft-\nware programs, the data may be observed “in plain view”\ndoes not alter this conclusion. As the Supreme Court has\nwarned:\n\n    [I]n the vast majority of cases, any evidence seized\n    by the police will be in plain view, at least at the\n    moment of seizure. The problem with the “plain\n    view” doctrine has been to identify the circum-\n    stances in which plain view has legal significance\n    rather than being simply the normal concomitant of\n    any search, legal or illegal.\n\nCoolidge, 403 U.S. at 465.\n\n  The off-site forensic examination of computer data is sim-\nply not one of those circumstances that fits the “plain view”\nparadigm. Indeed, to hold otherwise would be to write out the\nFourth Amendment’s particularity requirement with respect to\n\f19882   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nelectronic data and to transform particularized search warrants\ninto general search warrants, with the government authorized\nto conduct indiscriminate, dragnet searches.\n\n                               b\n\n   The government also failed to sustain its burden to estab-\nlish the plain view exception because, as the district courts\nfound, the incriminating character of the information was not\n“immediately apparent.” It was clear under the testing proto-\ncol that positive tests did not necessarily reflect steroid use;\nthe use of nutritional supplements—which is common in pro-\nfessional sports—could also yield a false positive. In addition,\nthere are a whole host of legitimate reasons for individuals to\nbe prescribed steroid products. The CDT testing was not\nundertaken to test individual players; but rather to provide a\nsurvey for the possible establishment of an individual drug\ntesting protocol.\n\n   What the government relied on was sheer speculation that\nthe presence of positive steroid markers would mean that the\nathlete had received steroids without prescription from some\nunknown person. The crime that the government was inter-\nested in pursuing was the illegal distribution of steroids. The\nevidence of a positive test was not affirmative evidence of any\ndistribution. The government’s theory was that, armed with\nthe test results, the government could then summon the athlete\nbefore a grand jury to see if it could obtain evidence from\nwhom and under what circumstances the athlete may have\nobtained steroids.\n\n   However, the mere suspicion of criminal activity or the sus-\npicion of knowledge of a criminal activity is not sufficient to\nsustain a seizure of evidence under the plain view doctrine.\nAs the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear, the “imme-\ndiately apparent” requirement means that the law enforcement\nofficer must have probable cause to seize the property that the\nofficer observed in plain view. As the Court explained:\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             19883\n     We now hold that probable cause is required. To say\n     otherwise would be to cut the “plain view” doctrine\n     loose from its theoretical and practical moorings. . . .\n     Dispensing with the need for a warrant is worlds\n     apart from permitting a lesser standard of cause for\n     the seizure than a warrant would require, i.e., the\n     standard of probable cause. No reason is apparent\n     why an object should routinely be seizable on lesser\n     grounds, during an unrelated search and seizure, than\n     would have been needed to obtain a warrant for that\n     same object if it had been known to be on the prem-\n     ises.\n\nArizona v.

For those players, the govern-\nment provided extensive information showing their alleged\nconnection to Balco. However, the government conceded that\nit had no information connecting any of the other players to\nBalco. Indeed, it made that clear in both its affidavits and sub-\nsequent hearings. The affidavit provided to Judge Lloyd spec-\nulated that evidence might be developed linking the players\nwho tested positive to Balco “because of the closely-knit pro-\nfessional baseball community,” but also speculated that the\npositive test results could suggest “another significant source\nof illegal performance-enhancing drugs.” In fact, the govern-\nment had no evidence whatsoever that it tendered in support\nof either theory. The government did not have any informa-\ntion concerning who might be involved in any distribution\nscheme; in fact, it had no idea at all.12\n  12\n     For example, the government engaged in the following colloquy at\none hearing:\n    Counsel:   Your honor, it’s evidence because it’s evidence of an\n               illegal distribution of steroids to other people.\n    Court:     From where?\n    Counsel:   From where? That’s an excellent question, and that is\n               why we need the evidence.\n\f19884    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The government did not submit any evidence contradicting\nthe affidavits indicating the possibility of false positives and\nthat a positive result did not necessarily indicate illegal steroid\nuse. There was no specific target of the investigation against\nwhom the government sought incriminating evidence.\n\n   Mere speculation is not sufficient to establish probable\ncause. United States v. Howard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493964\"><a href=\"/opinion/493964/united-states-v-randy-ray-howard-united-states-of-america-v-robert-leroy/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (9th Cir.\n1987). Perhaps the government had reasonable suspicion, but\nthat is not sufficient to justify a seizure under the plain view\ndoctrine. See Hicks, 480 U.S. at 326 (holding that “probable\ncause is required”); Payton, 445 U.S. at 587 (explaining the\nplain view requirement that there be “probable cause to asso-\nciate the property with criminal activity.”).\n\n                                6\n\n   For all of these reasons, I would hold that the finding that\nthe government acted in callous disregard of the rights of the\nplayers is completely supported by the record. The district\ncourts made no error, much less a clear error, in finding that\nthe first Ramsden factor was satisfied. The district courts\nrightfully rejected the government’s “plain view” justifica-\ntion, and I respectfully disagree with the majority’s new rule\nrejecting the sound procedures described in Tamura.\n\n                                B\n\n   The second Ramsden factor is whether the movant has an\nindividual interest in and the need for the property he wants\nreturned. I agree with the majority and the district courts that\nthe Players Association satisfied this requirement. At issue are\nthe Fourth Amendment rights of the players. As we know, the\nFourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures into areas in which they have a legiti-\nmate expectation of privacy. Katz v.

L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996).14\n  14\n    HIPAA was far from Congress’s first foray into privacy protection. As\nthe United States Department of Heath and Human Services noted:\n       In the 1970s, individual privacy was paramount in the passage of\n       the Fair Credit Reporting Act (1970), the Privacy Act (1974), the\n       Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (1974), and the Right\n       to Financial Privacy Act (1978). These key laws were followed\n       in the next decade by another series of statutes, including the Pri-\n       vacy Protection Act (1980), the Electronic Communications Pri-\n       vacy Act (1986), the Video Privacy Protection Act (1988), and\n       the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (1988). In the last ten\n       years, Congress and the President have passed additional legal\n       privacy protection through, among others, the Telephone Con-\n       sumer Protection Act (1991), the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act\n       (1994), the Telecommunications Act (1996), the Children’s\n       Online Privacy Protection Act (1998), the Identity Theft and\n       Assumption Deterrence Act (1998), and Title V of the Gramm-\n       Leach-Bliley Act (1999) governing financial privacy.\n         In 1997, a Presidential advisory commission, the Advisory\n       Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19887\nIn the regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA, the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services\nemphasized the importance of maintaining the privacy of\nmedical information, concluding that “[p]rivacy is a funda-\nmental right” and that “[a] right to privacy in personal infor-\nmation has historically found expression in American law.”15\n65 Fed.Reg. at 82,464.\n\n   In sum, given controlling legal authority, there is no ques-\ntion that the baseball players who participated in the random\ntesting had a justified expectation of privacy in the test results\nand, in particular, that the test results would not be disclosed.16\n\n    Care Industry, recognized the need for patient privacy protection\n    in its recommendations for a Consumer Bill of Rights and\n    Responsibilities (November 1997). In 1997, Congress enacted the\n    Balanced Budget Act (Public Law 105-34), which added lan-\n    guage to the Social Security Act (18 U.S.C. 1852) to require\n    Medicare+Choice organizations to establish safeguards for the\n    privacy of individually identifiable patient information. Similarly,\n    the Veterans Benefits section of the U.S. Code provides for confi-\n    dentiality of medical records in cases involving drug abuse, alco-\n    holism or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle cell anemia (38\n    U.S.C. 7332).\nStandards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, 65\nFed.Reg. 82,462, 82,469 (Dec. 28, 2000) (codified at former 45 C.F.R. pts.\n160, 164 (2002)).\n   15\n      The Department also emphasized that “While privacy is one of the\nkey values on which our society is built, it is more than an end in itself.\nIt is also necessary for the effective delivery of health care, both to indi-\nviduals and to populations. . . . The need for privacy of health information,\nin particular, has long been recognized as critical to the delivery of needed\nmedical care.” 65 Fed.Reg. at 82,467.\n   16\n      That the athletes had a justified, reasonable expectation of privacy in\nthe urine samples themselves that were seized by the government is\nbeyond question. See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112219\"><a href=\"/opinion/112219/skinner-v-railway-labor-executives-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615-617 (1989) (“it is clear that the collection and testing of\nurine intrudes upon expectations of privacy that society has long recog-\nnized as reasonable . . . .”).\n\f19888    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   Of course, under appropriate circumstances, justified pri-\nvacy expectations may be altered by contract. Yin, 95 F.3d at\n872. In this instance, the ballplayers’ privacy expectations\nwere heightened, not diminished, by the collective bargaining\nagreement between the Major League Baseball Players Asso-\nciation and Major League Baseball. The agreement was\nforged after years of impasse concerning steroid testing and,\nas I have discussed, called for anonymous testing to determine\nthe scope of the problem. To that end, the agreement pro-\nvided, in relevant part that:\n\n    1. During the 2003 season (which shall include\n    spring training but not include the post-season), all\n    Players will be subject to two tests (one initial test\n    and one follow-up test conducted not less than five\n    and not more than seven days following the initial\n    test) at unannounced times for the presence of\n    Schedule III steroids (“Survey Testing”). In addition\n    the Office of Commissioner shall have the right to\n    conduct additional Survey Testing in 2003 in which\n    up to 240 players, selected at random, may be tested.\n\n    2. If the results of the Survey Testing conducted in\n    2003 show that more than 5% of Players tested test\n    positive for Steroids, all Players will be subject to\n    two unannounced tests (an initial test and a followup\n    test five to seven days later) for Steroids during the\n    2004 season (“Program Testing”). If a Player tests\n    positive in the Program Testing, he shall immedi-\n    ately be placed on the Clinical Track and shall be\n    subject to discipline for further violations. The Pro-\n    gram Testing shall continue each season until less\n    than 2.5% of the Players tested test positive for Ste-\n    roids for two consecutive seasons combined.\n\n   In short, the only objective of the 2003 testing was to ascer-\ntain whether the threshold had been exceeded; it was not\nintended to test and monitor individual baseball players.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       19889\nIndeed, the testing protocol was designed to prevent the iden-\ntification of individual players and the matching of players\nwith test results. The record does not reflect whether any indi-\nvidual player was even informed of his testing results for the\n2003 sample year.\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement contains numerous\nprovisions assuring confidentiality. For example, the section\nconcerning the testing protocol provides:\n\n       The confidentiality of the Player’s participation in\n    the Program is essential to the Program’s success.\n    Except as provided in Section 8, the Office of the\n    Commissioner, the Association, HPAC, Club per-\n    sonnel, and all of their members, affiliates, agents,\n    consultants and employees are prohibited from pub-\n    licly disclosing information about the Player’s test\n    results, Initial Evaluation, diagnosis, Treatment Pro-\n    gram (including whether a Player is on either the\n    Clinical or Administrative Track), prognosis or com-\n    pliance with the Program.\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement specified in great\ndetail the manner of collection of data and, in particular pro-\nvided that:\n\n    At the conclusion of any Survey Test, and after the\n    results of all tests have been calculated, all test\n    results, including any identifying characteristics, will\n    be destroyed in a process jointly supervised by the\n    Office of the Commissioner and the Association.\n\n   The record contains many more references to the assurance\ngiven Major League Baseball players that the 2003 tests\nwould be anonymous and kept confidential, which are unnec-\nessary to detail. There simply is no doubt whatsoever that the\nplayers had a justified, constitutionally protected privacy\ninterest in the test results — an interest that was further\n\f19890    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nenhanced by the many protections and contractual obligations\ncontained in the collective bargaining agreement under which\nthe tests were conducted.\n\n   In sum, the players had a significant privacy interest in the\nmedical records and physical specimens. There is no doubt\nthat the players have an individual interest in and a need for\nthe property to be returned. Thus, the second Ramden factor\nis satisfied.\n\n                               C\n\n   I agree with the majority and the district courts that the\nplayers would be irreparably injured by denying the return of\nproperty. As the majority notes, the government has already\nconceded that the players have no adequate remedy at law for\nthe redress of their grievances. Therefore, the third and fourth\nRamsden factors are satisfied.\n\n   For these reasons, I agree with the majority that the district\ncourts properly exercised equitable jurisdiction. However, I\nwould hold that the district courts correctly found that all four\nRamsden factors were satisfied. I disagree with the majority\nthat the government’s actions properly respected the privacy\nrights of the players.\n\n                               IV\n\n   We review a district court decision to exercise its equitable\njurisdiction under Rule 41(g) under the deferential abuse of\ndiscretion standard. Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 324. I not only fail to\nsee any abuse of discretion in the decisions by the district\njudges to exercise their equitable jurisdiction, I agree entirely\nwith the district courts that the seized property should be\nreturned.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                19891\n                                     A\n\n   The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1989 amendments to\nRule 41(g) tell us that “reasonableness under all of the cir-\ncumstances” should be the governing standard for determin-\ning whether property should be returned. (emphasis added).\nThose same notes state that “[i]f the United States has a need\nfor the property in an investigation or prosecution, its reten-\ntion of the property generally is reasonable,” but that “in cer-\ntain circumstances . . . equitable considerations might justify\nrequiring the government to return or destroy all copies.” Id.17\n\n   Deciding between the two hinges on “whether the Govern-\nment’s conduct was sufficiently reprehensible in this case to\nwarrant this sanction.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 327. As the actions\nI have discussed make clear, the government’s behavior was\nsufficiently reprehensible and the privacy interests of the\nplayers who were neither named in the warrant nor implicated\nin any criminal activity sufficiently important to affirm the\ngranting of the 41(g) motions. Simply put, there is no reason\nfor the government to retain confidential medical information\nand bodily fluids of citizens who are not under any particular-\nized suspicion of criminal activity.\n\n                                     B\n\n   I have already detailed my disagreement with the majori-\nty’s evisceration of the Tamura procedure. In addition to that,\nI strongly disagree with the new procedure adopted by the\nmajority to supplant Tamura. The majority proposes that the\n  17\n     The cases the majority cites for the proposition that return of property\nis inappropriate when the government still needs it as evidence are hardly\nanalogous to the present case.

As the Supreme Court observed\nmany decades ago:\n\n    The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is\n    not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies\n    law enforcement the support of the usual inferences\n    which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its pro-\n    tection consists in requiring that those inferences be\n    drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead\n    of being judged by the officer engaged in the often\n    competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\n\nJohnson v.

As the\nSupreme Court explained in Aguilar v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106865\"><a href=\"/opinion/106865/aguilar-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1964):\n\n    The reasons for [the neutral and detached magistrate]\n    rule go to the foundations of the Fourth Amendment.\n    A contrary rule “that evidence sufficient to support\n    a magistrate’s disinterested determination to issue a\n    search warrant will justify the officers in making a\n    search without a warrant would reduce the Amend-\n\f          UNITED STATES v.

Under the\nmajority’s holding, the government is newly empowered to\nsearch the data before the magistrate authorizes the search.\nThis flips the traditional relationship of the magistrate to the\nsearching officer on its head. In all other contexts, the magis-\ntrate stands between the government and the privacy of indi-\nviduals; in the majority’s proposed world, the magistrate only\nappears after the privacy interests have been invaded.\n\n   Worse, under the majority’s holding, the seized material is\nnot presented to a magistrate at all except upon a “proper\npost-seizure motion by the aggrieved parties.” In other words,\nif no motion is made, there is never an “informed and deliber-\nate” examination of probable cause by a “neutral and\ndetached magistrate.” The government simply keeps and\nsearches the confidential data it seized without any suspicion\nof criminal activity. But how precisely is an honest citizen to\nknow if his or her confidential medical records have been\nseized by the government so that he or she may seek redress?\nThe search warrant is not directed to the innocent party; it is\nserved on the data repository. In the case at bar, the parties\nknew of the seizure of data pursuant to the search warrant\nbecause they were litigating (or at least thought they were liti-\ngating) the production of the material pursuant to a grand jury\nsubpoena. However, at least until this opinion has been\nissued, no one in the National Hockey League knew that the\ngovernment had seized medical records pertaining to its play-\ners without a warrant. Indeed, in the normal case, when a\nsearch warrant is directed to a third party, the innocent citizen\nwhose privacy interests are at stake will have no notice what-\nsoever that his privacy interests have been compromised.18\n  18\n    This problem is one of the reasons why the use of search warrants\nagainst third parties is strongly discouraged.\n\f19894    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nWithout notice, the “aggrieved party” will have no opportu-\nnity to make a “proper post-seizure motion” to have the mate-\nrial reviewed by the magistrate. The oddity of the majority’s\nholding is readily apparent: those suspected of crime or\ninvolved in some manner in the underlying criminal investiga-\ntion will learn of the seizure and can take steps to protect their\nFourth Amendment rights. However, the completely innocent\ncitizen with no involvement in the underlying investigation\nwhose data has been seized will not have notice or any oppor-\ntunity to protest. It is quite difficult to understand how this\nprocedure protects the right of law-abiding citizens “to be\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\nunreasonable searches and seizures.”\n\n   Even if, as in this case, a representative of the innocent “ag-\ngrieved party” had sufficient notice of the seizure, the inno-\ncent citizen is now required under the majority holding to hire\nan attorney and make a “proper post-seizure motion” to\nrequire the government do to what the Fourth Amendment\nrequired it to do in the first instance: establish before a neutral\nand detached magistrate that probable cause exists to seize\nand search the property.\n\n  In sum, under the majority’s holding, the eversion of the\nFourth Amendment is thus rendered complete. The govern-\nment is entitled to warrantless searches and seizures without\nprobable cause or particularized suspicion, and the honest citi-\nzen bears the cost and the burden of showing that the govern-\nment should have demonstrated probable cause before seizing\nand searching the law-abiding citizen’s personal property.\n\n                                2\n\n   The majority’s holding unfortunately does not stop with\nrequiring citizens to force the government to establish proba-\nble cause. Under the majority holding, even if a neutral and\ndetached magistrate concludes after an informed and deliber-\nate examination of the data that the government has not estab-\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             19895\nlished probable cause, the magistrate is not directed to limit\nthe seizure. To the contrary, if the magistrate determines that\nconfidential data cannot be separated, or cannot be separated\n“without creating new documents,” or that the unrelated con-\nfidential information cannot be excised “without distorting the\ncharacter of the original document,” then the government is\nentitled to keep the unrelated confidential data without show-\ning probable cause or reasonable suspicion. In the age of elec-\ntronic data, this holding virtually eliminates Fourth\nAmendment protections for confidential data. The usual prac-\ntice is to err on the side of redaction for the protection of\nthose whose privacy interests may be unnecessarily jeopar-\ndized. Unfortunately, the majority tilts the balance in the\nopposite direction, encouraging magistrates to allow the gov-\nernment to retain all unrelated data if the original data is co-\nmingled in some fashion.\n\n   Placing restrictions on magistrate’s ability to redact infor-\nmation and allowing the government to retain whole data-\nbases of confidential electronic information on the theory that\nsome data relevant to the warrant is “co-mingled” defies com-\nmon sense and the realities of electronic data storage. One of\nthe chief advantages of electronic data storage is that it allows\nlarge volumes of information to be retained in a very small\nspace, such as a computer hard drive. Another advantage of\nelectronic data storage is the ease of searching and examining\ndata. A relational database, such as the one at issue in this\ncase, is one in which the database is organized and accessed\naccording to the relationships between data items without the\nneed for any consideration of physical orientation and rela-\ntionship. Software programs allow the examination and corre-\nlation of information. A relational database provides the\nperfect vehicle for segregating non-relevant information. For\nexample, in this case, a simple search would have yielded the\ninformation responsive to the search warrant.19 However, an\n  19\n    The majority suggests that I would place the searching agents under\na duty to rely on CDT to guide their search, but I suggest no such thing.\n\f19896     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ninherent feature of a relational database is that data is “co-\nmingled.” Instead of using the power of a relational database\nto protect legitimate privacy interests, the majority would\nadopt a rule discouraging—if not precluding—such a use.\nUnder the majority’s approach, the government would be\nentitled to retain all electronic information if “co-mingled.”\nGiven that “co-mingling” is an inherent aspect of electronic\ndatabases, this restriction renders the Fourth Amendment a\nnullity in the electronic context.\n\n   The logic is circulate and the result completely predictable.\nThe government is entitled to seize property without a warrant\nonly if it is “co-mingled” and cannot be segregated. Then, if\na party objects the seizure, the data must be presented to a\nmagistrate judge who must release it back to the government\nintact if the magistrate judge determines that the irrelevant\ndata is “co-mingled” and cannot be segregated. The exercise\nis purely illusory and can only lead to an intellectual cul-de-\nsac. The Fourth Amendment’s probable cause requirement is\nneatly and entirely eliminated.\n\n  The majority not only countenances this procedure, but\nencourages it. I cannot agree. In the electronic age, magistrate\njudges should be required to use all available tools—software\nas well as black marker—to redact confidential information\nnot responsive to a warrant in order to protect the privacy of\ninnocent citizens who are not suspected of any crime.\n\n                                     3\n\n  The profound consequences of the majority rule are readily\ndemonstrated by the case at bar. Because they had no notice\n\nWhen data searching functions are available, as they were here, agents or\ntheir consultants are perfectly capable of conducting key word searches\nthemselves, with or without any information from the party being\nsearched. Here, CDT—a third party entity not suspected of any crime—\noffered to segregate the data utilizing the functions of the program. A fur-\nther, and much better alternative, would be to transfer the data to a magis-\ntrate judge for segregation and management.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING     19897\nof the governments’s seizure, no objections were filed by the\nthirteen other major sports organizations, three unaffiliated\nbusiness entities, and three sports competitions whose data\nwas seized. Therefore, a magistrate will never review that\nunauthorized seizure under the majority holding. Under the\nmajority’s rule, the government will also be allowed to retain\nall of the information it seized from those who did object\nbecause the information is co-mingled and cannot be segre-\ngated without changing its original character.\n\n   There is no need to reinvent the wheel. The Tamura proce-\ndure has been part of our court’s precedent for almost a quar-\nter of a century. Tamura provides a practical and sensible\nmethod by which the government may obtain data to which\nit is rightfully entitled without violating the constitutional\nrights of honest citizens. We should reaffirm Tamura, not\nsupplant it.\n\n                              V\n\n   For similar reasons, I would also affirm Judge Illston’s\ndecision to quash the May 6, 2004, subpoenas. The majority\ncontends that Judge Illston abused her discretion by resting\nher decision to quash the subpoenas on legally insufficient\ngrounds, citing In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated Dec. 10,\n1987, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556527\"><a href=\"/opinion/556527/in-re-grand-jury-subpoenas-dated-december-10-1987-does-i-through-iv-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1991), for the proposition that\nsubpoenas and search warrants serve different purposes and\ntherefore arguing that it cannot be considered an abuse to use\nboth methods of obtaining information. However, in this case,\nthe government’s conduct went beyond seeking warrants and\nsubpoenas for the same information at the same time. As dis-\ncussed previously, the government alternately sought subpoe-\nnas and warrants to obtain highly sensitive information from\nevery Major League Baseball player and to continue to keep\nthat information after being ordered to return it. Further, as\npreviously noted, there were no substantiated risks justifying\nthe use of a warrant to obtain the documentary evidence from\na third party under 28 C.F.R. § 59.1(b).\n\f19898   UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   In addition, it is worth nothing that the May 6 subpoenas\nrequested much of the same information sought in the April\n30 and prior search warrants. The affidavit to obtain the April\n30 search warrant from Judge Lloyd averred that the material\nwas necessary in part because the records may “establish a\nlink to the charged defendants in this case.” It is an abuse of\nthe grand jury process to use grand jury subpoenas to develop\npost-indictment trial material. See, e.g., In Re Grand Jury\nSubpoena Duces Tecum Dated January 2, 1985 (Simels), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454794\"><a href=\"/opinion/454794/in-re-grand-jury-subpoena-duces-tecum-dated-january-2-1985-robert-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (2d Cir.1985) (timing of subpoena, first issued\nafter indictment, suggested that its purpose was to obtain trial\nmaterial). The Balco indictments were returned in February.\nTherefore, the issuance of the May 6 grand jury subpoena,\nfollowing on the heels of the search warrant application for\nthe same information indicating that its partial purpose was to\ndevelop links to Balco, suggests an abuse of grand jury pro-\ncess.\n\n   Given the history of this case, the district court’s conclu-\nsion that the filing of these subpoenas was “the culmination\nof a series of actions taken by the government in order to pre-\nvent the MLBPA and CDT’s attempt to move to quash the\nJanuary and March subpoenas” is fully supported by the\nrecord and certainly cannot be said to be an abuse of discre-\ntion.\n\n                              VI\n\n   I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the media has\nstanding on appeal to file a motion to unseal records. I also\nagree that, under the circumstances presented by this case, the\nmotion should be referred to the district courts on remand.\n\n   I write separately to comment on what I view as a regretta-\nble effort by both parties in the district courts to circumvent\nthe procedures we have established to balance the First\nAmendment rights of the press with the confidentiality that is\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          19899\nrequired for some criminal proceedings.20 Specifically, I note\nthat all of the district court proceedings were closed by insis-\ntence of the parties, without notice to the press or public.\n\n   In some instances, courtroom closures were obtained with-\nout prior notice to the district court itself. For example, the\ntranscript of one of the hearings before one of the district\ncourt judges reflects the following colloquy:\n\n       Court:    Why is that, that you are locking the door?\n\n       Clerk:    Since the case was filed under seal.\n\n       Court:    Is this all under seal? * * * You want the\n                 hearings under seal. There was no motion\n                 made to seal the hearing. I wasn’t aware\n                 you wanted it that way.\n\n       Counsel: Your honor, we filed the pleadings under\n                seal. We think this proceeding should be\n                under seal. The information at issue is\n                highly confidential.\n\n   After some colloquy, the court allowed the courtroom to be\nsealed, but admonished counsel to file an appropriate motion\nif they wished any further courtroom proceedings to be closed\nin the future. However, neither the public nor the press were\nnotified that the doors were to be locked and the public\nbarred.\n\n  “Under the first amendment, the press and the public have\na presumed right of access to court proceedings and docu-\nments.” Oregonian Pub.

None of these procedural\nsteps were undertaken in the district courts.\n\n   To be sure, the right of access to court proceedings is not\nabsolute. Id. at 946. Both parties have legitimate privacy\ninterests to protect. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nrequire “matters affecting a grand jury proceeding to be\nclosed to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters\noccurring before a grand jury.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(5). In\naddition, as I have discussed, the athletes represented by the\nPlayers Association have a very strong privacy interest in\ntheir medical records. However, there are non-grand jury\n  21\n    Indeed, transcripts of court proceedings “must be released when the\nfactors militating in favor of closure no longer exist.” Id. at 947-48.\n\f          UNITED STATES v.

Unfortunately, the parties\npresented hearing closure and record sealing as a fait accom-\npli to the district courts, without notice to the press or public.\nNow that we have remanded the motion to unseal, this issue\nmay be addressed.\n\n                                   VII\n\n   In discussions of the alleged use of steroids by baseball\nplayers, much is made about “the integrity of the game.” Even\nmore important is the integrity of our legal system. Perhaps\nbaseball has become consumed by a “Game of Shadows,”23\nbut that is no reason for the government to engage in a “Pros-\necution of Shadows.” The district judges were entirely right\nto order the government to return the thousands of private\nmedical records it wrongfully seized by use of pretext and\nartifice.\n\n   I would affirm the orders of the district court and must\nrespectfully dissent from the majority’s contrary conclusion.\nI concur in the remand of the motion to unseal records.\n  22\n      The government, in at least one proceeding, seemed to indicate that\nit might not oppose unsealing some material, with government counsel\nstating before Judge Mahan: “As a matter of DOJ regulation and policy,\nwe actually have taken the position and we do take the position that there\nisn’t a need to have these proceedings actually sealed, and that is because\nof the paramount interest in having actual public proceedings in court-\nrooms held in public.” However, the government did not object formally\nto sealing the transcript of that hearing, and the transcript has, to date,\nbeen sealed.\n   23\n      Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, Game of Shadows (2006).\n\f</pre>",
