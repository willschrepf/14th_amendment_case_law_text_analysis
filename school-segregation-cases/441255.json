Southwick, Circuit Judge:*\n       Plaintiff Jane Doe, on behalf of her two minor daughters, filed suit against\nthe Vermilion Parish School Board. She claimed that single-sex classes were\nbeing conducted in violation of the Constitution and federal law. The current\nappeal is from the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction.\n       We AFFIRM.\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       Jane Doe is the mother of Joan and Jill Doe, who attend public schools\noperated by the Vermilion Parish School Board (“Vermilion” or the “Board”).\nDuring the 2009-2010 school year, Joan was an eighth-grader and Jill a sixth-\ngrader at Rene A. Rost Middle School. At school orientation on August 4, 2009,\nDoe learned that her daughters had been placed in core classes in which only\ngirls were allowed. This assignment was mandatory.\n       A little more than a month later, Doe filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Louisiana. She claimed that the\nBoard’s single-sex education program violated various federal regulations\nimplementing Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, and other laws. She sought injunctive and other relief.\n       The record reveals that Rost Middle School Principal David Dupuis\ninitiated the single-sex education program. In 2008, he asked the Board to allow\nhim to conduct an experiment for his doctoral dissertation in which some eighth-\ngraders would be placed in single-sex classes during the middle third of the\n2008-2009 school year. His proposal included studies describing the benefits of\nsingle-sex education, but he did not include studies that identified negative\nconsequences of such education. The Board approved his request.\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR . R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR .\nR. 47.5.4.\n\n                                              2\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 3 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\n      In June 2009, Dupuis presented the Board with a summary of the results.\nHis data showed significantly improved academic performance and a 52 percent\ndecline in behavioral problems during the single-sex term. He claimed that\ngrades declined after the students returned to coed classes.\n      Dupuis’s data was inaccurate. The district court said “it sure looks like he\nfudged a bunch of the numbers” in order to support his conclusion that single-sex\neducation improved academic performance. Doe’s expert analyzed the school’s\ngrading records and testified that grades actually declined during the period of\nsingle-sex education.\n      Dupuis’s analysis of the behavioral data was also inaccurate. He admitted\nin court that the introduction of a state-mandated “positive behavior support”\nsystem had improved student behavior, not single-sex education.\n      In 2009, Vermilion’s superintendent and Board were unaware of these\nproblems and were “impressed” with Dupuis’s purported results. The Board\nvoted to approve single-sex education “at any of the middle schools on an\noptional basis based on what the staff and administration at the school felt.” In\ndiscovery, Vermilion admitted that Dupuis’s research and presentations were\nthe sole basis for the Board’s decision to justify the new program. In court, the\nsuperintendent added that the Board also relied upon the input of teachers and\na few parents who favored single-sex education.\n      After securing Board approval, Rost Middle School assigned students for\nthe 2009-2010 school year to single-sex classes in each core subject, which are\nmath, science, language arts, social studies, and reading. In each grade, two\nall-boy and two all-girl classes were designated. A fifth class was coeducational.\nParents were first told of the single-sex classes at the August orientation.\n      Counsel for Doe soon thereafter wrote school officials to contend that the\nprogram was illegal, in part because the single-sex classes were not voluntary.\nThe superintendent testified that after reviewing the letter, he and the Board’s\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 4 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 10-30378\n\nattorney determined that “we were exactly in violation. . . . We weren’t aware of\nthe law. We didn’t go back and research it to see the proper way of doing that.\n. . . [W]e were in violation. There is no doubt about it.”\n      “The law” to which the superintendent was referring was a set United\nStates Department of Education regulations on structuring a program of same-\nsex classes.       In 2006, the Department of Education issued regulations\nauthorizing public schools to offer single-sex education options under certain\nconditions. Generally speaking, single-sex public education is permitted when:\n      (i) Each single-sex class or extracurricular activity is based on the\n      [school’s]1 important objective--\n             (A) To improve educational achievement of its students,\n             through a [school’s] overall established policy to provide\n             diverse educational opportunities, provided that the\n             single-sex nature of the class or extracurricular activity\n             is substantially related to achieving that objective; or\n             (B) To meet the particular, identified educational needs\n             of its students, provided that the single-sex nature of\n             the class or extracurricular activity is substantially\n             related to achieving that objective;\n      (ii) The [school] implements its objective in an evenhanded manner;\n      (iii) Student enrollment in a single-sex class or extracurricular\n      activity is completely voluntary; and\n      (iv) The [school] provides to all other students, including students\n      of the excluded sex, a substantially equal coeducational class or\n      extracurricular activity in the same subject or activity.\n34 C.F.R. § 106.34(b)(1)(i)-(iv).\n      The regulations list certain exceptions to this general standard and detail\nhow single-sex education programs will be reviewed. Id. § 106.34(a), (b)(4). For\nexample, every two years a participating school must evaluate its program\n      to ensure that single-sex classes or extracurricular activities are\n      based upon genuine justifications and do not rely on overly broad\n      generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences\n      of either sex and that any single-sex classes or extracurricular\n\n      1\n          We have substituted the word “recipient” with “school” for simplicity.\n\n                                               4\n\f     Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 5 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                    No. 10-30378\n\n      activities are substantially related to the achievement of the\n      important objective for the classes or extracurricular activities.\nId. § 106.34(b)(4)(i).2 The Department of Education and the Department of\nJustice have filed an amicus brief in this case describing these regulations as\npermitting a narrow exception to the general rule of coeducation.\n      These regulations provide some foundation for a public school’s attempt\nto experiment with single-sex education. We express no view today on whether\nthese regulations are contrary to Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause, or the\nother authorities Doe cites. At this stage, we note only that there is some\ncurrently-existing authority for a school to utilize same-sex programs to improve\neducational outcomes.\n      Upon learning of these regulations, the Board attempted to confirm its\nprogram by making the single-sex classes voluntary. It provided consent forms\nto parents and asked them to mark whether they wanted single-sex or coed\nclasses for their children.\n      After the consent forms were received, though, Dupuis made a series of\nphone calls to parents who had selected coed classes. He convinced over 30\nfamilies to move their children into single-sex classes. There is no evidence that\nhe called a parent who initially chose single-sex to discuss the possibility of\nswitching to coed. As a result, Rost Middle School’s coed classes for the 2009-\n2010 school year were 73 percent boys and 27 percent girls, when the population\nof the school was closer to 55 percent boys and 45 percent girls.\n      Doe first sought to have both daughters opt out. Her older daughter Joan\nremained in the single-sex class after Dupuis talked to Joan at school about her\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        The regulations sought to apply the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996), which interpreted the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment in the context of single-sex public higher education. 71 Fed. Reg.\n62530-01, 62535-38 (Oct. 25, 2006).\n\n                                           5\n\f     Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 6 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                      No. 10-30378\n\nplacement. The younger daughter, Jill, was transferred into a coed class at the\ntime the complaint was filed.\n       Doe learned that these coed classes were disproportionately filled with\nstudents with special needs and Individual Education Plans (“IEPs”).3 Parents\nof these students stated Vermilion had threatened to abandon their child’s IEP\nif they elected the single-sex class.            One parent said Principal Dupuis\nencouraged her to move her child into the single-sex class because her child\nwould be “pushed harder” there and that single-sex was “a better class”; Dupuis\nadmitted the former quote but denied saying the latter.\n       Of the 38 IEP students with more severe impairments, 37 were placed into\ncoed classes. At the same time, all of the IEP students that were “talented and\ngifted” were spread throughout the single-sex classes.4\n       As a result of these assignments, the average GPA of students in coed\nclasses was, for the fifth, sixth, and eighth grades, a minimum of 0.4 points, or\napproximately half a grade, below the average GPA of students in single-sex\nclasses. The results for the seventh grade were less uniform, but the coed\nclasses generally had lower GPAs than the single-sex classes.\n       While Vermilion intentionally placed IEP students in the coed section, it\nwas not clear whether it did so to encourage other students to select single-sex\nclasses, for teacher convenience, or for other reasons. There apparently had\nbeen a prior request from a teacher to group the IEP students in one classroom.\n       There were several other differences between the coed and single-sex\nclasses. The coed classes had physically and mentally disabled students come\nin for one hour of instruction each day; those students never came into the\n\n\n       3\n       IEPs are part of the mechanism to implement the federal Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act. See 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.\n      4\n        At Rost Middle School in 2009-2010, a total of 69 students had IEPs. Seventeen of\nthese students were also classified as “talented and gifted.”\n\n                                             6\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 7 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\nsingle-sex classes. Similarly, a group of students working toward their GED\noccasionally came into the coed classes but never into the single-sex classes.\n      This evidence reveals differences between the two categories of classes.\nEven so, Vermilion’s pleadings described its single-sex education program as\n“equal but separate.” It argued that regardless of the classroom composition,\neach of the core courses was “taught by the same teacher with the same\nstate-mandated curriculum, same tests, same schedule, same resources, same\nclassroom and same materials.”       Vermilion asserted that this “substantial\nequality” was permitted by the Department of Education regulations.\n      Vermilion acknowledged at least one intentional deviation from the “equal\nbut separate” concept.     It would use different teaching strategies in the\nsingle-sex classes “in order to tailor learning toward the strengths and needs of\nboys or girls.” This included assigning different books to boys and girls based on\ntheir perceived interests. It also included teaching with “action techniques”\nwith boys but “a more quiet environment” with girls. Vermilion says it continues\nto use sex-based “differential teaching strategies” during the current school year.\n      On April 19, 2010, the district court issued its ruling. The court described\na number of problems with Vermilion’s single-sex program, including “significant\nflaws” in Dupuis’s data and “an extreme lack of oversight over this program at\nthe fault of both the Vermilion Parish School Board and Principal David\nDupuis.”    The court held that any discrimination by Vermilion was\nunintentional, and on that basis denied Doe’s motion for injunctive relief.\n      The district court went further than just denying the injunction. Citing\n“the best interests of the children,” the court ordered Vermilion to follow a 10-\nstep plan to implement single-sex education during the 2010-2011 school year.\nThe plan required, among other things, better parental notice about single-sex\neducation, two additional coed sections in each grade, a more even gender\ndistribution of students, and IEP services in each type of classroom. It also\n\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 8 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-30378\n\nallowed parents who objected to single-sex education to move their child to any\nfully-coed public school nearest their residence. Several of these improvements\nhad been suggested by Vermilion in a post-hearing memorandum. Doe appealed.\n      The duration of the court’s order is uncertain.          The order required\nVermilion “to implement the following plan in future school years with\nsupervision by the Court for one year.” What is clear is that the court’s oversight\nends with the imminent expiration of the current school year.\n      In May 2010, Joan Doe completed eighth grade and graduated from Rost\nMiddle School. Jill Doe is now a seventh grader, enrolled again in a coed class.\n                                  DISCUSSION\n      This court has jurisdiction over “[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts\n. . . granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions.” Texas\nMidstream Gas Servs., LLC v. City of Grand Prairie, 608 F.3d 200, 204 (5th Cir.\n2010) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1)) (quotation marks omitted).\n      Our jurisdiction extends to the entire order from which Doe appeals,\nincluding that portion of the order that required Vermilion to take certain steps\nin administering its 2010-2011 single-sex education program.            “[A]n order\ngranting or refusing an injunction brings before the appellate court the entire\norder, not merely the propriety of injunctive relief . . . .” Magnolia Marine\nTransp. Co. v. Laplace Towing Corp., 964 F.2d 1571, 1580 (5th Cir. 1992)\n(quotation marks and citation omitted).\n      A preliminary injunction is not to be issued lightly. See Bluefield Water\nAss’n, Inc. v. City of Starkville, Miss., 577 F.3d 250, 253 (5th Cir. 2009). A\nfortiori, an appellate court should with at least equal care consider whether to\norder a preliminary injunction that a district court denied. We review a district\ncourt’s decision on an injunction for an abuse of discretion, regardless of whether\nit was granted or denied. Speaks v.

Women’s Med.\nCtr. of Nw. Houston v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2001).\n      After finding “significant flaws” in Vermilion’s justification for single-sex\neducation, as well as Vermilion’s negligent oversight of that program, the district\ncourt concluded that the program was lawful because there was no intentional\ndiscrimination.\n      A plaintiff who claims that a governmental classification explicitly based\non sex violates the Equal Protection Clause, though, does not have to show\ndiscriminatory intent. See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 531, 533; Pers. Adm’r of Mass.\nv. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272-73 (1979). Instead, courts are to apply intermediate\nscrutiny. See LeClerc v. Webb, 419 F.3d 405, 420 (5th Cir. 2005). Intermediate\nscrutiny places the burden “entirely on the State” to demonstrate an\n“exceedingly persuasive” justification for the classification. Virginia, 518 U.S.\nat 533.\n      In addition to the Equal Protection issue, the district court did not address\nDoe’s remaining arguments that Vermilion’s single-sex education program\nviolated: (1) the plain language of Title IX; (2) Title IX implementing regulations\nfrom the United States Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human\nServices, and Homeland Security; and (3) the 2006 Department of Education\nregulations on single-sex education we quoted above.\n      For a preliminary injunction, each element of this test must be satisfied:\n      (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial\n      threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued, (3) that\n      the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any\n      harm that will result if the injunction is granted, and (4) that the\n      grant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest.\n\n\nSpeaks, 445 F.3d at 399-400 (citation omitted). The district court did not discuss\nthese factors, but as we noted, it denied an injunction for other reasons.\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f     Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 10 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-30378\n\n      Vermilion argues that we need not reach the merits because we should\ndismiss the appeal for lack of standing and mootness.           We address these\narguments first, cognizant that the “actual case or controversy must exist in\nevery stage in the judicial process.” Motient Corp. v. Dondero, 529 F.3d 532, 537\n(5th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted); see U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.\n      We conclude that there is standing, but based on the current record we\ncannot determine if the issues surrounding future injunctive relief are moot.\nI.    Standing\n      Vermilion does not contest that Joan, the older daughter, had standing to\nbring the suit.   Joan was enrolled in a single-sex class in 2009-2010, and\ngraduated from Rost Middle School in May 2010.\n      As to the younger daughter, Jill, Vermilion argues that she lacks standing\nto challenge same-sex classes because she was and currently is enrolled in a coed\nclass. After being moved from a single-sex class into a coed class in September\n2009, Jill remained in the coed class throughout that school year. She is again\nenrolled in a coed class this school year. Vermilion contends that as a non-\nparticipant, Jill has not been injured by the single-sex program. Doe responds\nthat she is injured by being subjected to a discriminatory practice, that\nVermilion’s single-sex program denies her “the benefit of a true coeducational\neducation,” and that she testified to the specifics of how her coed education is\nunequal and inadequate.\n      To establish standing, “a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a\nconcrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, that the\ninjury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that it is likely that a favorable\ndecision will redress that injury.” Mass. v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 517 (2007)\n(citation omitted). Here, only the first element is disputed.\n      We find some guidance in the Supreme Court’s analysis of standing for\nparents who challenged a public school assignment policy utilizing race as a\n\n                                         10\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 11 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\nfactor. Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701,\n713, 718 (2007).    The Seattle school district allowed incoming ninth-grade\nstudents to apply to attend any of its high schools. Id. at 711. When a school\nwas too popular or unpopular, one of the factors the district would use to select\nwhich students would attend was the applicant’s race. Id. at 711-12. The\ndistrict wanted a certain degree of racial balance and used the circumstance of\nthe over- and under-subscribed schools to strive toward that balance. Id.\n      The district argued that the parent group lacked standing for future\ninjunctive relief because the injuries its members claimed were too speculative,\ni.e., only if their children applied to a school that had too many applicants would\nrace become a factor; even when that occurred, the factor of race might actually\nadvantage the applicant. Id. at 718-19. Chief Justice Roberts held the plaintiffs\nhad standing. Id. He wrote that “one form of injury under the Equal Protection\nClause is being forced to compete in a race-based system that may prejudice the\nplaintiff, an injury that the members of Parents Involved can validly claim on\nbehalf of their children.” Id. at 719 (citations omitted).\n      The Court relied on a previous decision in which a contractor was held to\nhave standing when he complained of having to compete for federal projects that\ngave an advantage to bidders who employed minority subcontractors. Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 204 (1995). Even though the contractor\nsought injunctive relief, which necessarily would apply to future contracts in\nwhich the result of its bid could not yet be known, the Court held there was\nstanding. Id. at 212. In reaching that decision, the Adarand opinion applied the\nrequirements for Article III standing that a plaintiff have suffered an injury that\nis “(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural\nor hypothetical.” Id. at 211 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n560 (1992)) (quotation marks omitted). The allegations supported that Adarand\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 12 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\nwas prevented “from competing on an equal footing.” Id. (quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n      In our case, Jill’s argument on standing is not the same as in Parents\nInvolved or Adarand.     In these two precedents, the injury was potentially\nmissing out on being admitted to the school a plaintiff perceived to be best, or\nnot to get a contract for which it had not yet bid. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at\n719; Adarand, 515 U.S. at 212.       Jill’s argument basically is that the sex-\nclassification at her school has reduced the quality of education. There is no\n“best school” to which Jill could not be admitted or advantage she was denied\nthat others are receiving.\n      Jill’s claim of standing is that the creation of same-sex classes has\nprevented her from getting the education she would otherwise receive. Her\nexamples of shortcomings include that there are a disproportionate number of\nIEP students in Rost Middle School’s coed classrooms. Further, based on her\nexperience in both kinds of classrooms, she testified that the coed classroom: (1)\nused different subject-matter tests; (2) had a teacher’s aide that spoke loudly to\nother students and distracted her; and (3) had a teacher read tests aloud. She\nalso said other students taunted her for being in the “special needs class.”\n      Therefore, standing for Jill is based on the argument that both the coed\nand the same-sex classes are inferior to what would be available were this\nprogram not in place. Girls are effectively denied the benefits of being in the\nsame classroom with boys. Though there is a coed class in which those benefits\nwould be available, the argument is that the same-sex classes prevent quality\ncoed classes from being offered. She also argues that girls are subjected to an\nunfavorable education and teaching methods based on stereotypes. There is\nsome evidence to support that. She further alleges that her own coed classroom\nhas been modified unfavorably by the imposition of gender sorting.\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\f      Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 13 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-30378\n\n       Though there are distinctions that can be made from Parents Involved and\nAdarand, we accept that Jill’s allegations of injury, resulting from a diminished\nquality of education due to the creation of same-sex classes, are sufficient to\nconfer standing.\nII.    Mootness\n       The Supreme Court has referred to mootness as “the doctrine of standing\nset in a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the\ncommencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its\nexistence (mootness).” United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388,\n397 (1980) (quoting Monaghan, Constitutional Adjudication: The Who and\nWhen, 82 Yale L.J. 1363, 1384 (1973)) (quotation marks omitted).\n       Both parties agree that this interlocutory appeal is moot as to Joan Doe\nbecause she graduated from Rost Middle School in May 2010. Any injunctive\nrelief this court could provide would not apply to her. “As is so often the case in\nsuits for injunctive relief brought by students, graduation or impending\ngraduation renders their claims for injunctive relief moot” as they “will not\nbenefit from a favorable ruling[.]” Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 874\n(5th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). Joan’s claims for damages, though, can\nproceed in the district court. See id. at 875.\n       A.    Mootness as to Jill for the 2009-2011 School Years\n       The harder question is whether the issue of an injunction is moot as to Jill,\nwho remains a student at the school. She is a seventh-grader in the school year\nthat will soon end, and may attend Rost Middle School for one more year after\nthat. Vermilion’s central argument as to mootness regarding Jill is that “in both\nher complaint and in her motion for injunctive relief, plaintiff sought relief only\nwith regards to the 2009-2010 school year which concluded in May of 2010 and,\nas a result, there is no pending case or controversy.” This is an argument that\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 14 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\nthe issue Doe presented to the district court was limited to the 2009-2010 school\nyear. See Harris v. City of Houston, 151 F.3d 186, 190-91 (5th Cir. 1998).\n      We begin our analysis of whether that is a fair characterization by looking\nclosely at Doe’s September 8, 2009, motion for injunctive relief. There we find\na request to halt single-sex education at Rost Middle School “in the 2009-2010\nacademic year.”\n      Somewhat differently, the first and last sentence of that same motion\nrequested injunctive relief until “decision on the merits in this case”; similarly,\nthe proposed order attached to Doe’s brief in support of the motion was not time-\nlimited.   Doe’s complaint, filed the same day, also requested a permanent\ninjunction to prevent “Defendants from segregating any class or educational\nprogram by sex” and “[p]ermanently enjoin all Defendants . . . to take all\naffirmative steps necessary . . . to prevent similar future occurrences.” This\nreflects Doe’s argument that no amended policy or procedural improvement can\nsave single-sex public education.\n      The record after the September 2009 complaint is also instructive. On\nJanuary 5, 2010, the district court notified the parties that, “to be quite honest\nwith you, I don’t think anything is going to change for this school year but it\ncould change for next school year one way or the other.” Vermilion did not object\nto carrying Doe’s motion and applying it to the 2010-2011 school year. That is\nthe school year, though nearing the end, in which our decision is being issued.\n      Throughout the parties’ voluminous filings in Spring 2010, neither\ncharacterized Doe’s request for relief as time-limited.      Vermilion offered a\n“Proposed Plan for 2010-2011 School Year” containing eight paragraphs of\nimprovements for a continued single-sex education program. Vermilion’s current\narguments about the temporal limitations on the injunction are inconsistent\nwith the arguments it made in district court.\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 15 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\n      Further, during the hearing on injunctive relief, Jane Doe personally\nasked that any injunction not take effect during the 2009-2010 school year\nbecause it could disrupt the students and impede state testing. She instead\nasked the court to return the school to coeducation starting in the 2010-2011\nschool year. Vermilion did not object and instead solicited testimony from its\nofficials that Rost Middle School could make appropriate changes to its single-\nsex education program for the 2010-2011 school year.\n      The district court’s order required Vermilion “to implement the following\nplan in future school years with supervision by the Court for one year.” Until\nfurther order of the court, then, or perhaps until Vermilion decided no longer to\nhave same-sex classes, the rules outlined in the order were to be followed.\n      In summary, we accept that a close look at the motion by itself would not\nsupport that an injunction was explicitly requested beyond a now-passed school\nyear. Such a close look would not resolve the issue, though. “Even if not raised\nby the pleadings, once issues are presented and argued without objection by\nopposing counsel, such issues are tried by the implied consent of the parties and\nare treated as if they had been raised in the pleadings.” Apple Barrel Prods.,\nInc. v. Beard, 730 F.2d 384, 389 (5th Cir. 1984) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)).\nVermilion suggested in the district court that modifications be made to its\nprogram during the 2010-2011 school year. In making that suggestion, it did not\ncontend that Doe’s request was time-limited.\n      There was support in the pleadings, reinforced by the manner in which the\nissue was presented, and further supported by the actual order from the district\ncourt, to indicate that there was a clear issue of enjoining single-sex classes at\nthe time of the motion and into the future.\n      We also conclude, though, that the propriety of injunctive relief for the\nfirst and second relevant school years, i.e., 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, has become\neffectively moot during the pendency of this appeal. Much for the reasons\n\n                                       15\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 16 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-30378\n\noffered by Doe at the February 2010 hearing in district court applicable to the\n2009-2010 year, it is now too late in the 2010-2011 year to order any immediate\nchange in classes. Stopping same-sex classes for the remainder of this school\nyear would not be meaningful relief because it would not benefit anyone and\nwould be sufficiently disruptive to be harmful. See Pederson, 213 F.3d at 874.\nThe propriety of that much of the trial court’s ruling is functionally moot.\n       B.     Mootness for Future School Years\n       The remaining time-frame for our analysis of mootness is that which starts\nat the end of the current school year and extends into so much of the future as\nis needed to reach a final resolution in this case. Will Jill continue to have a\npersonal stake in injunctive relief?\n       The order from which this appeal was taken allowed same-sex classes to\ncontinue, denied the preliminary injunction that would have required\nabandoning same-sex classes beginning with the 2010-2011 school year, and held\nthat only for that school year the court would supervise the operation of the\nclasses. We have interpreted the presentation of these issues in the district\ncourt to include a request for an injunction for all subsequent school years\npending the resolution of the case on the merits. The injunction requested was\ndenied, but a court order setting certain requirements for future same-sex\nclasses was put in place. That order seemed to continue until altered.\n       We must ask whether there is enough in this record to resolve whether Jill\nhas a personal stake in the resolution of injunctive relief applicable to all future\nclass years until this matter is resolved on the merits. We do not know if Jill\nwill be enrolled at Rost Middle School in the next school year, whether there will\nbe same-sex classes offered there and, if so, whether they will be in the same\nform as ordered by the district court for 2010-2011.5 The court order required\n\n       5\n         A voluntary cessation of single-sex education would not foreclose forward-looking\ninjunctive relief unless “it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation\n\n                                              16\n\f     Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 17 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                          No. 10-30378\n\nsame-sex classes to be conducted in a certain way, but we do not interpret it to\nrequire such classes to exist.\n       For all these reasons, we conclude that we cannot determine whether\nissues are moot regarding the district court’s refusal to issue an injunction to bar\nsame-sex classes that would apply to school years after the one now ending. We\ntherefore remand for that determination. If the questions are found not to be\nmoot, then what the future holds will also be for the district court to resolve on\nremand.\n       Even without the issues of mootness that cannot be resolved, we also do\nnot find enough in this record to make a de novo review of the court’s order on\nthe injunction. The four factors relevant to that determination cannot be applied\nin a factual vacuum. See Speaks, 445 F.3d at 399-400. The same factual\nuncertainties about the future time period to which a preliminary injunction\nwould apply that we just discussed as to mootness, also would require us to\nremand for further proceedings even were the mootness concerns nonexistent.\n       We therefore leave undisturbed the April 19, 2010 order that denied Doe’s\nrequest for an injunction during the pendency of the litigation.\n                                        CONCLUSION\n       On remand, if Vermilion desires to continue same-sex classes and seeks\nto justify them under the 2006 Department of Education regulations, the district\ncourt must consider whether the classes meet those standards. Unless the issue\nis avoidable, the district court will then need to consider whether federal law and\nthe Constitution permit that program.\n       If injunctive relief is again requested, the district court will review what\nVermilion proposes for the future. See ICEE Distribs., Inc. v. J&J Snack Foods\nCorp., 445 F.3d 841, 849-50 (5th Cir. 2006) (reconsideration of preliminary\n\n\n. . . that the alleged violation will recur . . . .” Pederson, 213 F.3d at 874 (citation omitted); see\nHernandez v. Cremer, 913 F.2d 230, 235 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                                 17\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 18 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-30378\n\ninjunction issues may be appropriate when the facts and circumstances have\nchanged). Even when a preliminary injunction is appropriate, though, “it is\nfrequently desirable in such cases to expedite the trial on the merits.” Allied\nMktg. Grp, Inc. v. CDL Mktg., Inc., 878 F.2d 806, 815 (5th Cir. 1989) (citation\nomitted). The most expedient way for the parties to receive “considered plenary\nreview” on future appeal is to proceed to a decision on the merits. Neb. Press\nAss’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 547 (1976). We encourage the parties to reach the\nmerits on a full record before again presenting this court with these issues. See\nBlack Fire Fighters Ass’n of Dallas v. City of Dallas, Tex., 905 F.2d 63, 66 (5th\nCir. 1990).\n      AFFIRMED. Vermilion’s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED.

Southwick, Circuit Judge:*\n       Plaintiff Jane Doe, on behalf of her two minor daughters, filed suit against\nthe Vermilion Parish School Board. She claimed that single-sex classes were\nbeing conducted in violation of the Constitution and federal law. The current\nappeal is from the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction.\n       We AFFIRM.\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       Jane Doe is the mother of Joan and Jill Doe, who attend public schools\noperated by the Vermilion Parish School Board (“Vermilion” or the “Board”).\nDuring the 2009-2010 school year, Joan was an eighth-grader and Jill a sixth-\ngrader at Rene A. Rost Middle School. At school orientation on August 4, 2009,\nDoe learned that her daughters had been placed in core classes in which only\ngirls were allowed. This assignment was mandatory.\n       A little more than a month later, Doe filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Louisiana. She claimed that the\nBoard’s single-sex education program violated various federal regulations\nimplementing Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, and other laws. She sought injunctive and other relief.\n       The record reveals that Rost Middle School Principal David Dupuis\ninitiated the single-sex education program. In 2008, he asked the Board to allow\nhim to conduct an experiment for his doctoral dissertation in which some eighth-\ngraders would be placed in single-sex classes during the middle third of the\n2008-2009 school year. His proposal included studies describing the benefits of\nsingle-sex education, but he did not include studies that identified negative\nconsequences of such education. The Board approved his request.\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR . R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR .\nR. 47.5.4.\n\n                                              2\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 3 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\n      In June 2009, Dupuis presented the Board with a summary of the results.\nHis data showed significantly improved academic performance and a 52 percent\ndecline in behavioral problems during the single-sex term. He claimed that\ngrades declined after the students returned to coed classes.\n      Dupuis’s data was inaccurate. The district court said “it sure looks like he\nfudged a bunch of the numbers” in order to support his conclusion that single-sex\neducation improved academic performance. Doe’s expert analyzed the school’s\ngrading records and testified that grades actually declined during the period of\nsingle-sex education.\n      Dupuis’s analysis of the behavioral data was also inaccurate. He admitted\nin court that the introduction of a state-mandated “positive behavior support”\nsystem had improved student behavior, not single-sex education.\n      In 2009, Vermilion’s superintendent and Board were unaware of these\nproblems and were “impressed” with Dupuis’s purported results. The Board\nvoted to approve single-sex education “at any of the middle schools on an\noptional basis based on what the staff and administration at the school felt.” In\ndiscovery, Vermilion admitted that Dupuis’s research and presentations were\nthe sole basis for the Board’s decision to justify the new program. In court, the\nsuperintendent added that the Board also relied upon the input of teachers and\na few parents who favored single-sex education.\n      After securing Board approval, Rost Middle School assigned students for\nthe 2009-2010 school year to single-sex classes in each core subject, which are\nmath, science, language arts, social studies, and reading. In each grade, two\nall-boy and two all-girl classes were designated. A fifth class was coeducational.\nParents were first told of the single-sex classes at the August orientation.\n      Counsel for Doe soon thereafter wrote school officials to contend that the\nprogram was illegal, in part because the single-sex classes were not voluntary.\nThe superintendent testified that after reviewing the letter, he and the Board’s\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 4 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 10-30378\n\nattorney determined that “we were exactly in violation. . . . We weren’t aware of\nthe law. We didn’t go back and research it to see the proper way of doing that.\n. . . [W]e were in violation. There is no doubt about it.”\n      “The law” to which the superintendent was referring was a set United\nStates Department of Education regulations on structuring a program of same-\nsex classes.       In 2006, the Department of Education issued regulations\nauthorizing public schools to offer single-sex education options under certain\nconditions. Generally speaking, single-sex public education is permitted when:\n      (i) Each single-sex class or extracurricular activity is based on the\n      [school’s]1 important objective--\n             (A) To improve educational achievement of its students,\n             through a [school’s] overall established policy to provide\n             diverse educational opportunities, provided that the\n             single-sex nature of the class or extracurricular activity\n             is substantially related to achieving that objective; or\n             (B) To meet the particular, identified educational needs\n             of its students, provided that the single-sex nature of\n             the class or extracurricular activity is substantially\n             related to achieving that objective;\n      (ii) The [school] implements its objective in an evenhanded manner;\n      (iii) Student enrollment in a single-sex class or extracurricular\n      activity is completely voluntary; and\n      (iv) The [school] provides to all other students, including students\n      of the excluded sex, a substantially equal coeducational class or\n      extracurricular activity in the same subject or activity.\n34 C.F.R. § 106.34(b)(1)(i)-(iv).\n      The regulations list certain exceptions to this general standard and detail\nhow single-sex education programs will be reviewed. Id. § 106.34(a), (b)(4). For\nexample, every two years a participating school must evaluate its program\n      to ensure that single-sex classes or extracurricular activities are\n      based upon genuine justifications and do not rely on overly broad\n      generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences\n      of either sex and that any single-sex classes or extracurricular\n\n      1\n          We have substituted the word “recipient” with “school” for simplicity.\n\n                                               4\n\f     Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 5 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                    No. 10-30378\n\n      activities are substantially related to the achievement of the\n      important objective for the classes or extracurricular activities.\nId. § 106.34(b)(4)(i).2 The Department of Education and the Department of\nJustice have filed an amicus brief in this case describing these regulations as\npermitting a narrow exception to the general rule of coeducation.\n      These regulations provide some foundation for a public school’s attempt\nto experiment with single-sex education. We express no view today on whether\nthese regulations are contrary to Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause, or the\nother authorities Doe cites. At this stage, we note only that there is some\ncurrently-existing authority for a school to utilize same-sex programs to improve\neducational outcomes.\n      Upon learning of these regulations, the Board attempted to confirm its\nprogram by making the single-sex classes voluntary. It provided consent forms\nto parents and asked them to mark whether they wanted single-sex or coed\nclasses for their children.\n      After the consent forms were received, though, Dupuis made a series of\nphone calls to parents who had selected coed classes. He convinced over 30\nfamilies to move their children into single-sex classes. There is no evidence that\nhe called a parent who initially chose single-sex to discuss the possibility of\nswitching to coed. As a result, Rost Middle School’s coed classes for the 2009-\n2010 school year were 73 percent boys and 27 percent girls, when the population\nof the school was closer to 55 percent boys and 45 percent girls.\n      Doe first sought to have both daughters opt out. Her older daughter Joan\nremained in the single-sex class after Dupuis talked to Joan at school about her\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        The regulations sought to apply the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v.\nVirginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118056\"><a href=\"/opinion/118056/united-states-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996), which interpreted the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment in the context of single-sex public higher education. 71 Fed.

The younger daughter, Jill, was transferred into a coed class at the\ntime the complaint was filed.\n       Doe learned that these coed classes were disproportionately filled with\nstudents with special needs and Individual Education Plans (“IEPs”).3 Parents\nof these students stated Vermilion had threatened to abandon their child’s IEP\nif they elected the single-sex class.            One parent said Principal Dupuis\nencouraged her to move her child into the single-sex class because her child\nwould be “pushed harder” there and that single-sex was “a better class”; Dupuis\nadmitted the former quote but denied saying the latter.\n       Of the 38 IEP students with more severe impairments, 37 were placed into\ncoed classes. At the same time, all of the IEP students that were “talented and\ngifted” were spread throughout the single-sex classes.4\n       As a result of these assignments, the average GPA of students in coed\nclasses was, for the fifth, sixth, and eighth grades, a minimum of 0.4 points, or\napproximately half a grade, below the average GPA of students in single-sex\nclasses. The results for the seventh grade were less uniform, but the coed\nclasses generally had lower GPAs than the single-sex classes.\n       While Vermilion intentionally placed IEP students in the coed section, it\nwas not clear whether it did so to encourage other students to select single-sex\nclasses, for teacher convenience, or for other reasons. There apparently had\nbeen a prior request from a teacher to group the IEP students in one classroom.\n       There were several other differences between the coed and single-sex\nclasses. The coed classes had physically and mentally disabled students come\nin for one hour of instruction each day; those students never came into the\n\n\n       3\n       IEPs are part of the mechanism to implement the federal Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act. See 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.\n      4\n        At Rost Middle School in 2009-2010, a total of 69 students had IEPs. Seventeen of\nthese students were also classified as “talented and gifted.”\n\n                                             6\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 7 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\nsingle-sex classes. Similarly, a group of students working toward their GED\noccasionally came into the coed classes but never into the single-sex classes.\n      This evidence reveals differences between the two categories of classes.\nEven so, Vermilion’s pleadings described its single-sex education program as\n“equal but separate.” It argued that regardless of the classroom composition,\neach of the core courses was “taught by the same teacher with the same\nstate-mandated curriculum, same tests, same schedule, same resources, same\nclassroom and same materials.”       Vermilion asserted that this “substantial\nequality” was permitted by the Department of Education regulations.\n      Vermilion acknowledged at least one intentional deviation from the “equal\nbut separate” concept.     It would use different teaching strategies in the\nsingle-sex classes “in order to tailor learning toward the strengths and needs of\nboys or girls.” This included assigning different books to boys and girls based on\ntheir perceived interests. It also included teaching with “action techniques”\nwith boys but “a more quiet environment” with girls. Vermilion says it continues\nto use sex-based “differential teaching strategies” during the current school year.\n      On April 19, 2010, the district court issued its ruling. The court described\na number of problems with Vermilion’s single-sex program, including “significant\nflaws” in Dupuis’s data and “an extreme lack of oversight over this program at\nthe fault of both the Vermilion Parish School Board and Principal David\nDupuis.”    The court held that any discrimination by Vermilion was\nunintentional, and on that basis denied Doe’s motion for injunctive relief.\n      The district court went further than just denying the injunction. Citing\n“the best interests of the children,” the court ordered Vermilion to follow a 10-\nstep plan to implement single-sex education during the 2010-2011 school year.\nThe plan required, among other things, better parental notice about single-sex\neducation, two additional coed sections in each grade, a more even gender\ndistribution of students, and IEP services in each type of classroom.

Several of these improvements\nhad been suggested by Vermilion in a post-hearing memorandum. Doe appealed.\n      The duration of the court’s order is uncertain.          The order required\nVermilion “to implement the following plan in future school years with\nsupervision by the Court for one year.” What is clear is that the court’s oversight\nends with the imminent expiration of the current school year.\n      In May 2010, Joan Doe completed eighth grade and graduated from Rost\nMiddle School.

Standing\n      Vermilion does not contest that Joan, the older daughter, had standing to\nbring the suit.   Joan was enrolled in a single-sex class in 2009-2010, and\ngraduated from Rost Middle School in May 2010.\n      As to the younger daughter, Jill, Vermilion argues that she lacks standing\nto challenge same-sex classes because she was and currently is enrolled in a coed\nclass. After being moved from a single-sex class into a coed class in September\n2009, Jill remained in the coed class throughout that school year. She is again\nenrolled in a coed class this school year. Vermilion contends that as a non-\nparticipant, Jill has not been injured by the single-sex program. Doe responds\nthat she is injured by being subjected to a discriminatory practice, that\nVermilion’s single-sex program denies her “the benefit of a true coeducational\neducation,” and that she testified to the specifics of how her coed education is\nunequal and inadequate.\n      To establish standing, “a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a\nconcrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, that the\ninjury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that it is likely that a favorable\ndecision will redress that injury.” Mass. v.

The Seattle school district allowed incoming ninth-grade\nstudents to apply to attend any of its high schools. Id. at 711. When a school\nwas too popular or unpopular, one of the factors the district would use to select\nwhich students would attend was the applicant’s race. Id. at 711-12. The\ndistrict wanted a certain degree of racial balance and used the circumstance of\nthe over- and under-subscribed schools to strive toward that balance. Id.\n      The district argued that the parent group lacked standing for future\ninjunctive relief because the injuries its members claimed were too speculative,\ni.e., only if their children applied to a school that had too many applicants would\nrace become a factor; even when that occurred, the factor of race might actually\nadvantage the applicant. Id. at 718-19. Chief Justice Roberts held the plaintiffs\nhad standing. Id. He wrote that “one form of injury under the Equal Protection\nClause is being forced to compete in a race-based system that may prejudice the\nplaintiff, an injury that the members of Parents Involved can validly claim on\nbehalf of their children.” Id. at 719 (citations omitted).\n      The Court relied on a previous decision in which a contractor was held to\nhave standing when he complained of having to compete for federal projects that\ngave an advantage to bidders who employed minority subcontractors.

Even though the contractor\nsought injunctive relief, which necessarily would apply to future contracts in\nwhich the result of its bid could not yet be known, the Court held there was\nstanding.

In reaching that decision, the Adarand opinion applied the\nrequirements for Article III standing that a plaintiff have suffered an injury that\nis “(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural\nor hypothetical.” Id. at 211 (quoting Lujan v.

(quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n      In our case, Jill’s argument on standing is not the same as in Parents\nInvolved or Adarand.     In these two precedents, the injury was potentially\nmissing out on being admitted to the school a plaintiff perceived to be best, or\nnot to get a contract for which it had not yet bid. Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at\n719; Adarand, 515 U.S. at 212.       Jill’s argument basically is that the sex-\nclassification at her school has reduced the quality of education. There is no\n“best school” to which Jill could not be admitted or advantage she was denied\nthat others are receiving.\n      Jill’s claim of standing is that the creation of same-sex classes has\nprevented her from getting the education she would otherwise receive. Her\nexamples of shortcomings include that there are a disproportionate number of\nIEP students in Rost Middle School’s coed classrooms. Further, based on her\nexperience in both kinds of classrooms, she testified that the coed classroom: (1)\nused different subject-matter tests; (2) had a teacher’s aide that spoke loudly to\nother students and distracted her; and (3) had a teacher read tests aloud. She\nalso said other students taunted her for being in the “special needs class.”\n      Therefore, standing for Jill is based on the argument that both the coed\nand the same-sex classes are inferior to what would be available were this\nprogram not in place. Girls are effectively denied the benefits of being in the\nsame classroom with boys. Though there is a coed class in which those benefits\nwould be available, the argument is that the same-sex classes prevent quality\ncoed classes from being offered. She also argues that girls are subjected to an\nunfavorable education and teaching methods based on stereotypes. There is\nsome evidence to support that. She further alleges that her own coed classroom\nhas been modified unfavorably by the imposition of gender sorting.\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\f      Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 13 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-30378\n\n       Though there are distinctions that can be made from Parents Involved and\nAdarand, we accept that Jill’s allegations of injury, resulting from a diminished\nquality of education due to the creation of same-sex classes, are sufficient to\nconfer standing.\nII.    Mootness\n       The Supreme Court has referred to mootness as “the doctrine of standing\nset in a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the\ncommencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its\nexistence (mootness).” United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110228\"><a href=\"/opinion/110228/united-states-parole-commn-v-geraghty/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n397 (1980) (quoting Monaghan, Constitutional Adjudication: The Who and\nWhen, 82 Yale L.J. 1363, 1384 (1973)) (quotation marks omitted).\n       Both parties agree that this interlocutory appeal is moot as to Joan Doe\nbecause she graduated from Rost Middle School in May 2010. Any injunctive\nrelief this court could provide would not apply to her. “As is so often the case in\nsuits for injunctive relief brought by students, graduation or impending\ngraduation renders their claims for injunctive relief moot” as they “will not\nbenefit from a favorable ruling[.]” Pederson v. La. State Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 874\n(5th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). Joan’s claims for damages, though, can\nproceed in the district court. See id. at 875.\n       A.    Mootness as to Jill for the 2009-2011 School Years\n       The harder question is whether the issue of an injunction is moot as to Jill,\nwho remains a student at the school. She is a seventh-grader in the school year\nthat will soon end, and may attend Rost Middle School for one more year after\nthat. Vermilion’s central argument as to mootness regarding Jill is that “in both\nher complaint and in her motion for injunctive relief, plaintiff sought relief only\nwith regards to the 2009-2010 school year which concluded in May of 2010 and,\nas a result, there is no pending case or controversy.” This is an argument that\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 14 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\nthe issue Doe presented to the district court was limited to the 2009-2010 school\nyear. See Harris v. City of Houston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756676\"><a href=\"/opinion/756676/nos-97-20138-98-20001/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190-91 (5th Cir. 1998).\n      We begin our analysis of whether that is a fair characterization by looking\nclosely at Doe’s September 8, 2009, motion for injunctive relief. There we find\na request to halt single-sex education at Rost Middle School “in the 2009-2010\nacademic year.”\n      Somewhat differently, the first and last sentence of that same motion\nrequested injunctive relief until “decision on the merits in this case”; similarly,\nthe proposed order attached to Doe’s brief in support of the motion was not time-\nlimited.   Doe’s complaint, filed the same day, also requested a permanent\ninjunction to prevent “Defendants from segregating any class or educational\nprogram by sex” and “[p]ermanently enjoin all Defendants . . . to take all\naffirmative steps necessary . . . to prevent similar future occurrences.” This\nreflects Doe’s argument that no amended policy or procedural improvement can\nsave single-sex public education.\n      The record after the September 2009 complaint is also instructive. On\nJanuary 5, 2010, the district court notified the parties that, “to be quite honest\nwith you, I don’t think anything is going to change for this school year but it\ncould change for next school year one way or the other.” Vermilion did not object\nto carrying Doe’s motion and applying it to the 2010-2011 school year. That is\nthe school year, though nearing the end, in which our decision is being issued.\n      Throughout the parties’ voluminous filings in Spring 2010, neither\ncharacterized Doe’s request for relief as time-limited.      Vermilion offered a\n“Proposed Plan for 2010-2011 School Year” containing eight paragraphs of\nimprovements for a continued single-sex education program. Vermilion’s current\narguments about the temporal limitations on the injunction are inconsistent\nwith the arguments it made in district court.\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 15 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-30378\n\n      Further, during the hearing on injunctive relief, Jane Doe personally\nasked that any injunction not take effect during the 2009-2010 school year\nbecause it could disrupt the students and impede state testing. She instead\nasked the court to return the school to coeducation starting in the 2010-2011\nschool year. Vermilion did not object and instead solicited testimony from its\nofficials that Rost Middle School could make appropriate changes to its single-\nsex education program for the 2010-2011 school year.\n      The district court’s order required Vermilion “to implement the following\nplan in future school years with supervision by the Court for one year.” Until\nfurther order of the court, then, or perhaps until Vermilion decided no longer to\nhave same-sex classes, the rules outlined in the order were to be followed.\n      In summary, we accept that a close look at the motion by itself would not\nsupport that an injunction was explicitly requested beyond a now-passed school\nyear. Such a close look would not resolve the issue, though. “Even if not raised\nby the pleadings, once issues are presented and argued without objection by\nopposing counsel, such issues are tried by the implied consent of the parties and\nare treated as if they had been raised in the pleadings.” Apple Barrel Prods.,\nInc. v. Beard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433080\"><a href=\"/opinion/433080/apple-barrel-productions-inc-a-texas-corporation-and-betty-sue-faglie/\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (5th Cir. 1984) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)).\nVermilion suggested in the district court that modifications be made to its\nprogram during the 2010-2011 school year. In making that suggestion, it did not\ncontend that Doe’s request was time-limited.\n      There was support in the pleadings, reinforced by the manner in which the\nissue was presented, and further supported by the actual order from the district\ncourt, to indicate that there was a clear issue of enjoining single-sex classes at\nthe time of the motion and into the future.\n      We also conclude, though, that the propriety of injunctive relief for the\nfirst and second relevant school years, i.e., 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, has become\neffectively moot during the pendency of this appeal. Much for the reasons\n\n                                       15\n\f    Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 16 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-30378\n\noffered by Doe at the February 2010 hearing in district court applicable to the\n2009-2010 year, it is now too late in the 2010-2011 year to order any immediate\nchange in classes. Stopping same-sex classes for the remainder of this school\nyear would not be meaningful relief because it would not benefit anyone and\nwould be sufficiently disruptive to be harmful. See Pederson, 213 F.3d at 874.\nThe propriety of that much of the trial court’s ruling is functionally moot.\n       B.     Mootness for Future School Years\n       The remaining time-frame for our analysis of mootness is that which starts\nat the end of the current school year and extends into so much of the future as\nis needed to reach a final resolution in this case. Will Jill continue to have a\npersonal stake in injunctive relief?\n       The order from which this appeal was taken allowed same-sex classes to\ncontinue, denied the preliminary injunction that would have required\nabandoning same-sex classes beginning with the 2010-2011 school year, and held\nthat only for that school year the court would supervise the operation of the\nclasses. We have interpreted the presentation of these issues in the district\ncourt to include a request for an injunction for all subsequent school years\npending the resolution of the case on the merits. The injunction requested was\ndenied, but a court order setting certain requirements for future same-sex\nclasses was put in place. That order seemed to continue until altered.\n       We must ask whether there is enough in this record to resolve whether Jill\nhas a personal stake in the resolution of injunctive relief applicable to all future\nclass years until this matter is resolved on the merits. We do not know if Jill\nwill be enrolled at Rost Middle School in the next school year, whether there will\nbe same-sex classes offered there and, if so, whether they will be in the same\nform as ordered by the district court for 2010-2011.5 The court order required\n\n       5\n         A voluntary cessation of single-sex education would not foreclose forward-looking\ninjunctive relief unless “it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation\n\n                                              16\n\f     Case: 10-30378 Document: 00511437364 Page: 17 Date Filed: 04/06/2011\n\n\n\n                                          No. 10-30378\n\nsame-sex classes to be conducted in a certain way, but we do not interpret it to\nrequire such classes to exist.\n       For all these reasons, we conclude that we cannot determine whether\nissues are moot regarding the district court’s refusal to issue an injunction to bar\nsame-sex classes that would apply to school years after the one now ending. We\ntherefore remand for that determination. If the questions are found not to be\nmoot, then what the future holds will also be for the district court to resolve on\nremand.\n       Even without the issues of mootness that cannot be resolved, we also do\nnot find enough in this record to make a de novo review of the court’s order on\nthe injunction. The four factors relevant to that determination cannot be applied\nin a factual vacuum. See Speaks, 445 F.3d at 399-400. The same factual\nuncertainties about the future time period to which a preliminary injunction\nwould apply that we just discussed as to mootness, also would require us to\nremand for further proceedings even were the mootness concerns nonexistent.\n       We therefore leave undisturbed the April 19, 2010 order that denied Doe’s\nrequest for an injunction during the pendency of the litigation.\n                                        CONCLUSION\n       On remand, if Vermilion desires to continue same-sex classes and seeks\nto justify them under the 2006 Department of Education regulations, the district\ncourt must consider whether the classes meet those standards. Unless the issue\nis avoidable, the district court will then need to consider whether federal law and\nthe Constitution permit that program.\n       If injunctive relief is again requested, the district court will review what\nVermilion proposes for the future.
