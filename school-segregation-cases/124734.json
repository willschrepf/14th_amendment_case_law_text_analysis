(“Unity”) and Jamie Hill-Daniel, M.D., from December 2009 to March 2011. Pending\n\nbefore the Court is the plaintiff’s claim that Dr. Hill-Daniel and Unity acted negligently by\n\nfailing to refer her in a timely manner for diagnostic testing of her breasts and for failing to take\n\ncertain other steps to ensure the timely diagnosis of her breast cancer. During a week-long bench\n\ntrial, the Court heard evidence on the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant. 1 For the reasons\n\n\n1\n The Court’s jurisdiction over this suit is not disputed. The parties agree that Unity and Dr. Hill-Daniel are deemed\nto be employees of the Public Health Service eligible for Federal Tort Claims Act malpractice coverage pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 223(g) because Unity is a grantee of the Department of Health and Human Services. Def.’s Proposed\nConcls. of Law at 1 n.1; Pl.’s Corrected Proposed Concls. of Law at 1 n.1. The FTCA also requires as a\njurisdictional predicate that the plaintiff exhaust her administrative remedies. See 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a); McNeil v.\nUnited States, 508 U.S. 106, 107 (1993); GAF Corp. v. United States, 818 F.2d 901, 904 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In this\ncase, the defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff has exhausted her administrative remedies. See Compl. ¶ 2\n(plaintiff alleges that on September 19, 2011, the plaintiff presented claims to the U.S. Department of Health &\nHuman Services and that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services failed to issue any determination on\nthe plaintiff’s claim within the mandatory six-month administrative waiting period); Answer ¶ 2 (defendant admits\nthat the plaintiff presented claims to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services on or about September 19,\n2011 and that the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services has failed to issue an determination of the\nplaintiff’s claim).\n\fexplained below, the Court concludes that the plaintiff has sustained her burden of proof on the\n\nnegligence claim, that judgment must be entered for the plaintiff, and that damages will be\n\nawarded in the amount of $4,458,582.17.\n\nI.     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       On March 23, 2012, the plaintiff initiated this medical malpractice lawsuit by filing a\n\ncomplaint against the United States alleging that the defendant was negligent in multiple\n\nrespects, including:\n\n       1. Failing to timely diagnose and treat the plaintiff’s breast cancer;\n\n       2. Failing to timely and appropriately order and obtain diagnostic studies in light of the\n          plaintiff’s medical history, complaints, signs, and symptoms;\n\n       3. Failing to appreciate the seriousness of the plaintiff’s condition;\n\n       4. Failing to provide appropriate and timely follow-up care;\n\n       5. Failing to timely and appropriately examine the plaintiff;\n\n       6. Failing to timely and appropriately obtain, interpret, and act upon the plaintiff’s\n          medical history and physical findings;\n\n       7. Failing to timely and appropriately assess the plaintiff’s condition;\n\n       8. Failing to timely and appropriately obtain consultations and/or interventions from\n          other health care providers;\n\n       9. Failing to make timely and appropriate referrals for diagnostic testing, care, and\n          treatment; and\n\n       10. Failing to take timely and appropriate steps to protect the health and well-being of the\n           plaintiff.\n\nCompl., ECF No. 1, ¶ 18.\n\n       At the plaintiff’s request, the Court imposed an expedited discovery and motions\n\nschedule, see Scheduling Order, ECF No. 9, and an expedited trial date, see Pretrial Order, ECF\n\n\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fNo. 20. 2 Shortly before trial, the defendant moved to amend its answer to the complaint to add a\n\ndefense of contributory negligence, and the plaintiff moved to preclude the defendant from\n\nnewly asserting the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and any claim of negligence\n\non the part of a third-party, Providence Hospital. See Pl.’s Mot. to Preclude New Assertions of\n\nContributory Negligence Defense and Any Claims of Negligence By Providence Hosp., ECF No.\n\n36; Def.’s Mem. Opp. to Pl.’s Mot. to Preclude Assertion of Contributory Negligence and Any\n\nClaims of Negligence by Providence Hospital and Mot. to Am. Answer, ECF No. 40. For the\n\nreasons stated at the hearing on these motions, on June 18, 2013, the Court granted the plaintiff’s\n\nmotion in part and denied the defendant’s motion, precluding as untimely the defendant’s\n\nassertion of a contributory negligence affirmative defense but permitting the defendant’s\n\nadmission of evidence regarding negligence on the part of Providence Hospital. See Minute\n\nOrder (June 18, 2013). 3, 4\n\n\n2\n  The schedule was subsequently modified upon requests made by both parties. See Minute Order (August 22,\n2012) (granting joint motion to amend scheduling order); Minute Order (November 16, 2012) (granting consent\nmotion for extension of time to complete discovery and for the defendant’s expert witness disclosures); Minute\nOrder (March 11, 2013 (granting joint motion to extend scheduling order); Minute Order (April 22, 2013) (granting\njoint motion for extension of time to complete discovery and to file motions in limine).\n3\n The Court relied on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c), which requires a defendant to state any affirmative\ndefenses, including contributory negligence, in a pleading responsive to the complaint. The purpose of that\nrequirement is to give the opposing party notice of the defense and to permit the opposing party to develop in\ndiscovery and present both evidence and argument before the district court responsive to the defense. Failure to\ncomply with Rule 8(c)’s timing requirement generally results in the waiver of that defense and its exclusion from the\ncase. Harris v. Secretary, 126 F.3d 339, 343 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citing Banks v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tele. Co.,\n802 F.2d 1416, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). The Court, however, recognized that “the purpose of pleading is to facilitate\na proper decision on the merits,” id., and that a defendant should be granted leave to amend an answer “when justice\nso requires,” in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15. FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(2). Courts in this Circuit\nevaluate when “justice so requires,” by looking to a number of factors, including whether the moving party engaged\nin undue delay and whether undue prejudice to the opposing party would result by virtue of allowance of the\namendment. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). Assessing the circumstances of this case, the Court\nfound that both undue delay and unfair prejudice would result if the defendant were permitted to amend its answer\nmore than nine months after the deadline set out in the applicable Scheduling Order for such amendments, and just\ntwo weeks before the bench trial was scheduled to commence. The plaintiff convincingly argued that her approach\nin discovery would have differed had she known of the defendant’s intention to prove contributory negligence –\nwhich, in this jurisdiction, operates as a complete bar to recovery – and with discovery closed at the time that the\ndefendant finally raised it, the plaintiff had lost that opportunity. See Atchinson v. District of Columbia, 73 F.3d\n418, 427 (D.C. Cir. 1996); (upholding the district court’s denial of the plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend a\ncomplaint because the district court found that the change would be prejudicial, and noting that the plaintiff had filed\n\n\n                                                               3\n\f         Over the course of the one-week bench trial, the plaintiff testified on her own behalf and\n\npresented the testimony of two of her treating physicians, four medical experts, and three\n\ndamages witness. In response, the defendant called the plaintiff’s primary care physician, two\n\nUnity employees, one employee of Providence Hospital, one of the plaintiff’s treating\n\nphysicians, and three medical expert witnesses. The defendant also played the videotaped de\n\nbene esse deposition of one damages expert witness. Following the conclusion of the bench trial,\n\nboth parties submitted proposed conclusions of law. See Pl.’s Corrected Proposed Concls. of\n\nLaw, ECF No. 63; 5 Def.’s Proposed Concls. of Law, ECF No. 65. In addition, the parties\n\nsubmitted three iterations of a Proposed Findings of Fact Table (“FOF Table”), in which they\n\nproposed individual findings of fact, and noted which facts were in dispute. See Order, ECF No.\n\n45 (explaining FOF Table); see also Proposed Findings of Fact, ECF No. 54 (“1st FOF Table”);\n\nProposed Findings of Fact, ECF No. 64 (“2d FOF Table”); Proposed Findings of Fact, ECF No.\n\n68 (“3rd FOF Table”). The Court has considered these submissions along with the testimony\n\nand exhibits at trial. 6\n\n\n\n\nhis motion for leave to amend “on the eve of trial, when discovery was complete,” that discovery would likely have\ndiffered and that the strategy and nature of the defendant officer’s defense probably would have also differed); cf.\nDoes I through III v. District of Columbia, 815 F. Supp. 2d 208, 216 & n.4 (D.D.C. 2011) (granting the plaintiff\nleave to amend his complaint because discovery on the merits was not closed and the proposed amendment would\nnot substantially alter the defendant’s discovery); Dove v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 221 F.R.D. 246, 249\n(D.D.C. 2004) (granting the defendant leave to amend its answer to assert a new affirmative defense when litigation\nwas in its early stages before the parties had appeared for an initial scheduling conference or even commenced\ndiscovery); Morgan v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 262 F.R.D. 5, 10 (D.D.C. 2009) (granting defendant leave to amend its\nanswer to assert the new affirmative defenses of claim preclusion and issue preclusion when the “litigation [was] in\nits nascent stages”).\n4\n  This case was re-assigned to the presiding Judge on June 17, 2013.\n5\n  The plaintiff timely filed her original proposed conclusions of law on July 5, 2013, ECF No. 54, but with leave of\nthe Court, filed a corrected proposed conclusions of law on July 16, 2013, ECF No. 63.\n6\n  The Court received the following exhibits into evidence during the bench trial: fifty-eight Plaintiff’s Exhibits: 1,\n3, 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 50A, 50 B,\n51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 67, 68, 73, 104, 106A, 106B, 106C, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118;\nand sixteen Defendant’s Exhibits: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 15, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 36, 37, 38.\n\n\n                                                                  4\n\f        Based upon the testimony presented and exhibits admitted at the trial, the Court makes\n\nthe findings of fact set forth below and further states its conclusions of law. See FED. R. CIV. P.\n\n52(a)(1) (“In an action tried on the facts without a jury . . . the court must find the facts specially\n\nand state its conclusions of law separately. The findings and conclusions may be stated on the\n\nrecord after the close of the evidence or may appear in an opinion or a memorandum of decision\n\nfiled by the court.”).\n\nII.     FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n        A.      OVERVIEW OF WITNESSES\n\n                1.

Lurito, Ph.D. Plaintiff also played an\n\naudio recording of excerpts from the deposition testimony of her primary care physician, Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel.\n\n                         a)     John Sutherland, M.D.\n\n        Dr. Sutherland is a board-certified family physician, who maintained private practices in\n\nMinneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, for eleven years, and has practiced in academic institutions\n\nin Minneapolis, Illinois, and Iowa for the past thirty-three years. Pl.’s Ex. 35 (Dr. Sutherland’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\fCV); Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 31:2–:5, 34:3–:5. Dr. Sutherland testified as one of two medical\n\nexperts for the plaintiff on the national standard of care applicable to a family practice physician\n\nregarding a primary care physician’s appropriate response to a patient’s breast complaints,\n\nincluding the steps necessary to ensure that diagnostic testing and specialty consultations are\n\nperformed on a timely basis. Id. at 32:22–33:5. Specifically, Dr. Sutherland opined that Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel breached the national standard of care by: (1) failing to fully investigate the\n\nplaintiff’s breast complaints on December 3, 2009; (2) failing either to schedule a return visit for\n\nthe plaintiff thirty to sixty days after the December 3, 2009 visit to reassess her complaints, or to\n\nrefer the plaintiff immediately for diagnostic imaging studies on that date; (3) delaying the\n\nplaintiff’s diagnosis by cancelling and rescheduling appointments multiple times; and (4) failing\n\nto take measures to expedite diagnostic testing after Dr. Hill-Daniel palpated a mass in the\n\nplaintiff’s left breast and lymph nodes under her left armpit on October 18, 2010. Id. at 37:9–\n\n:24, 50:18–55:5.\n\n                       b)      Shilisa Rhodes\n\n       The plaintiff testified about her visits with Dr. Hill-Daniel regarding her breast\n\ncomplaints, when Dr. Hill-Daniel allegedly failed to take the steps that would have led to an\n\nearlier diagnosis of her breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 78:11–83:25, 92:10–98:12. She\n\nalso testified about her experiences with Unity, her medical history, the referral process that she\n\nwent through to receive diagnostic imaging, and the harm that her diagnosis of Stage IV breast\n\ncancer has caused. Id. at 76:16–77:4, 84:1–91:25, 96:22–108:12.\n\n                       c)      F.

Dr. Tucker testified as the plaintiff’s expert about the behavior and\n\npathology of breast cancer, and its prognosis, diagnosis, staging, and curability. He opined that\n\nthe plaintiff’s breast cancer was Stage I in December 2009, and that if it had been diagnosed and\n\ntreated at that point, it would most likely have been cured. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 11:14–:19.\n\nHe also opined that sometime between July and November 2010, her cancer became Stage II by\n\nmetastasizing to the lymph nodes, and that it became Stage IV incurable cancer by metastasizing\n\nto her bone sometime between December 2010 and February 2011. Id. at 47:14–48:11, 49:17–\n\n:25.\n\n                        d)      Katherine Margo, M.D.\n\n        Dr. Margo is a board-certified family doctor who has practiced family medicine for\n\nthirty-one years and is currently a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania with a\n\nfamily medicine practice.

Pl.’s Ex. 38, at\n\n2 (Dr. Pushkas’s CV); see also Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 61:16–:17. Dr. Pushkas testified as one\n\nof plaintiff’s expert witnesses about the staging and progression of breast cancer. Dr. Pushkas\n\nopined that in December 2009, the plaintiff had Stage I breast cancer, that it progressed to Stage\n\nII sometime between July and August 2010, and that it progressed to Stage IV sometime between\n\nDecember 2010 and March 2011. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 67:16–69:5, 74:16–:24. Dr. Pushkas\n\nalso opined that if the plaintiff’s breast cancer had been diagnosed and treated while Stage I, she\n\nwould likely have had a 98% chance of survival, id. at 77:14–78:6; and while Stage II, a chance\n\nof survival in the 70% range. Id. at 78:14–:23. He also opined that with her Stage IV breast\n\ncancer diagnosis, she has only a 15–17% chance of five-year survival.

Nurse Patterson testified about the “cost and services for hospice care and\n\npalliative care” for the plaintiff through the end of the plaintiff’s life. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at\n\n\n\n\n                                                      9\n\f93:9–:15. In evaluating medical costs for the plaintiff’s care, Nurse Patterson examined\n\npalliative and hospice care, medical care, counseling services, and home care and/or hospice\n\ninpatient treatment. Id. at 94:13–17. Based on Ms. Tecala’s recommendation that the plaintiff\n\nattend weekly counseling sessions with a psychologist or social worker, Nurse Patterson\n\nestimated the cost of counseling for the plaintiff as $175 per week for 18 months, for a total of\n\n$13,650. Id. at 94:20–:22, 95:11; Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10. Nurse Patterson also opined that patients\n\nusually require palliative and hospice care for the last six months of life. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at\n\n94:13–:17. On that basis, she estimated the cost of six months of hospice care at $200 per day\n\nfor ninety days of in-home care ($18,000 total), and $700 per day for ninety days of inpatient\n\ncare, ($63,000 total). Id. at 96:6–:10, 96:25–97: 2; Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10. For the plaintiff’s medical\n\ncosts, Nurse Patterson estimated that during the last six months of her life, the plaintiff will\n\nrequire an oncologist’s care at $200 per visit, twice per month, for a total cost of $2,400; a\n\nprimary care physician’s care twice per month at $70 per visit, for a total cost of $840; and a pain\n\nmanagement specialist once a month at $500 per visit, for a total cost of $3,000. Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 56 at 97:15–18; Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10. Nurse Patterson estimated the cost of a twenty-four-hour\n\nper day in-home health aide for the last three months of the plaintiff’s life at $23 an hour, for a\n\ntotal of $49,680. Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10. In total, Nurse Patterson estimated the cost of the plaintiff’s\n\nfuture care needs at $150,570. Trial Tr.

Pl.’s Ex. 41, at 1.\n\nHe specializes in the area of determining economic loss. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 10:18–:20. Dr.\n\nLurito testified that the plaintiff could expect to suffer three types of economic loss: loss of\n\nearnings, loss of household services and future care costs. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 12:14–:23.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     10\n\fAs to loss of earnings, Dr. Lurito testified that the plaintiff would earn $737,715 in today’s\n\ndollars if her income stayed the same for the rest of her working life, which he assumed would\n\nend at age 65. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 13:13–:15; 14:1–:20; 15:14–:25. Dr. Lurito testified that\n\nhe applied a discount rate of 3.5 percent to all of his calculations to reflect the interest on the\n\njudgment. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 16:16–22; 17:16-:21; 23:4–:11; 25:24–26:1. Dr. Lurito\n\ncalculated the economic value of the loss of the plaintiff’s household services – which Dr. Lurito\n\ngenerally defined as the ability to provide childcare services to the plaintiff’s children – to be\n\nbetween $508,121 and $652,939. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 20:5–:13; 21:13–18. Dr. Lurito\n\ntestified that the range represents the difference between household services being provided until\n\nthe plaintiff’s youngest child reaches age eighteen or age twenty-one. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at\n\n21:5–:9. Finally, Dr. Lurito testified that the plaintiff’s future care costs, i.e., the costs of her\n\ntreatment until her death, were between $146,682 and $149,886. 7 Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 25:5–\n\n:11.\n\n                  2.       Defendant’s Witnesses\n\n         The defendant presented the testimony of the following nine witnesses, whose testimony\n\nis briefly summarized below: Dr. Hill-Daniel; Terita Jones; Diana Lapp, M.D.; Richard Carter,\n\nM.D.; Marshal Williams; two medical expert witnesses in the national standard of care, William\n\nMcLaurin Bethea Jr., M.D., and Edward Graeme Koch, M.D.; one medical expert witness in\n\noncology, John M. Feigert, M.D.; and one expert witness in economics, Gloria Hurdle, Ph.D. (by\n\nvideo deposition).\n\n                           a)       Jamie Hill-Daniel, M.D.\n\n\n\n7\n  Dr. Lurito applied a 3.75 or 4 percent “escalation rate” to some of the estimates Nurse Patterson provided to reflect\nthe increase in costs over the time in which the plaintiff would need future care, as well as applying a 3.5 percent\ndiscount rate to the costs to develop a present cost estimate that differs slightly from Nurse Patterson’s estimate.\n\n\n                                                              11\n\f       Dr. Hill-Daniel is a board-certified family medicine doctor with a practice at Unity’s\n\nCongress Heights location. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 60:10–:16, 61:15–:19, 64:23–:25. Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel testified that she also works as an assistant clinical professor for the Georgetown School\n\nof Medicine, the George Washington School of Medicine, and the Georgetown Residency\n\nProgram, and that she acts as both a staff physician and an attending physician at Providence\n\nHospital, with admitting privileges. Id. at 61:23–64:3. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified about her\n\ntreatment of the plaintiff as her primary care physician and, in particular, for the plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaints about pain, tenderness and knots in her breasts. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that even in\n\nhindsight, she would not have responded to the plaintiff’s breast complaints any differently than\n\nshe did. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 47:4–:15.\n\n                       b)      Terita Lynette Jones\n\n       Terita Jones is a care management support person for Unity at the Congress Heights\n\nlocation. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 8:23–9:8. Ms. Jones testified about how Unity processes\n\nreferrals and obtains insurance authorizations. She testified that she processes over fifty referrals\n\nper day for Dr. Hill-Daniel and three other physicians, and that she processed the referrals and\n\nauthorizations for the plaintiff to obtain diagnostic tests at Providence Hospital. Id. at 9:12–:14,\n\n26:7–:8. She also testified that she re-processed the plaintiff’s paperwork on November 3, 2010\n\nafter the plaintiff appeared for her appointment at Providence Hospital to obtain a diagnostic\n\nultrasound but could not obtain the test because Dr. Hill-Daniel had entered the wrong code on\n\nthe plaintiff’s referral and authorization forms. Id. at 22:14–31:21.\n\n                       c)      Diana Lapp, M.D.\n\n       Dr. Lapp is the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Vice President for Medical\n\nAdministration for Unity, and she testified about the policies and procedures in place to handle\n\n\n\n\n                                                      12\n\fthe between 550 and 600 patients seen each week at Unity’s Congress Heights location. Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 72 at 71:16–:20; 77:13–:15. Dr. Lapp testified that at a typical visit to Unity, a patient\n\nwill generally see a registration assistant for check-in, then a medical assistant who takes down\n\nher complaints, and then the doctor. Id. at 84:5–86:13. A patient may see a doctor either by\n\nmaking an appointment or walking in. Id. at 83:1–:6.\n\n                           d)       Richard Carter, M.D. 8\n\n         Dr. Carter is an emergency medicine doctor at Howard University Hospital who treated\n\nthe plaintiff for breast complaints on May 19, 2010. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 119:13–:15. Dr.\n\nCarter testified that his records of the visit reflect that the plaintiff’s chief complaint was\n\ntenderness in her left breast. Id. at 119:11–:12. He performed a physical exam and found\n\nmultiple tender breast cysts – one of which was particularly large – and no signs of infection. Id.\n\nat 122:6–123:23. Dr. Carter testified that he told the plaintiff to follow up with her primary care\n\nphysician. Id. at 123:24–124:9.\n\n                           e)       Marsha Williams\n\n         Ms. Williams is employed as a front desk registration clerk at Providence Hospital with\n\nresponsibility for performing intake for patients who have appointments for diagnostic\n\nmammograms, regular mammograms, ultrasounds, and bone-density scans. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n8\n  Dr. Carter was subpoenaed to appear at trial by counsel for the defendant. Before he took the stand to testify,\nplaintiff’s counsel raised an objection that defendant’s counsel had improperly spoken with Dr. Carter about the\nplaintiff’s care without proper authorization under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966\n(“HIPAA”). Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 108:12–:24. Two lead attorneys for the defendant orally represented to the\nCourt that they had never spoken to Dr. Carter. See id. 108:25–109:2, 109:20–:24. The Court determined that the\nbest course was to proceed with Dr. Carter’s examination, which would clarify the factual dispute about whether Dr.\nCarter had, in fact, been interviewed by defense counsel, and permit the parties to brief the issue of the alleged\nHIPAA violation after conclusion of the trial. Id. at 111:20–112:3. Just moments before Dr. Carter took the witness\nstand, however, a third attorney for the defendant, who did not examine any of the witnesses at trial, came forward\nand identified himself as the defense counsel who had interviewed Dr. Carter at the express direction of one of the\ntwo lead attorneys. Neither of the two lead defense attorneys, when denying any contact with Dr. Carter, had\nindicated to the Court that they had knowledge of any contact by another defense counsel with Dr. Carter or that\nanother attorney on the defense team had actually been directed to interview him. These blatant omissions by the\ntwo lead defense attorneys fall short of the level of candor that this Court expects under Rule 3.3 of the D.C. Rules\nof Professional Conduct.\n\n\n                                                             13\n\f72 at 141:4–:21. Ms. Williams testified that she was working when the plaintiff came in for an\n\nultrasound test on November 3, 2010, but the plaintiff could not have the procedure done\n\nbecause the code on her referral and insurance authorization was not accepted by Providence\n\nHospital. Id. at 144:21–146:6, 147:9–148:24. Ms. Williams also testified that in 2010 to 2011,\n\nultrasound appointments were scheduled about a week in advance, but if there were a need, they\n\ncould be scheduled within a couple of days, and that mammograms could be scheduled within a\n\nweek or two. Id. at 146:19–147:4.\n\n                        f)      Gloria Hurdle, Ph.D.\n\n        Dr. Hurdle is an economist with a Ph.D. in economics. Def.’s Ex. 28, at 1. Dr. Hurdle’s\n\nvideotaped de bene esse deposition was played during the bench trial and a transcript of Dr.\n\nHurdle’s deposition was introduced into evidence as Defendant’s Exhibit 36. Dr. Hurdle\n\ntestified about the plaintiff’s lost net earnings, lost household services, and future care costs.\n\nDef.’s Ex. 36 at 11:12–:24. Dr. Hurdle testified she calculated the plaintiff’s lost net income by\n\nassuming that the only change to the plaintiff’s salary over time would be inflation and by\n\nsubtracting a discount rate of 8.98 percent, to reflect the “riskiness” of the plaintiff’s ability to\n\nearn future wages. Id. at 15:3–:5, 18:14–19:12, 21:9–:17. In calculating these lost wages, Dr.\n\nHurdle used work-life expectancy tables to estimate that the plaintiff would have worked twenty-\n\nseven years between 2012 and retirement at age sixty-five. Id. at 29:2–5. She further reduced\n\nthe lost net income estimate by subtracting the amount of the plaintiff’s “consumption” during\n\nher lifetime. Id. at 15:9–:12. In estimating the loss of household services, Dr. Hurdle applied the\n\nsame discount rate of 8.98 percent and estimated the pecuniary loss to the plaintiff as between\n\n$166,521 (if calculated up to the plaintiff’s youngest child turning eighteen) and $191,239 (if\n\ncalculated up to the plaintiff’s youngest child turning twenty-one). Id. at 27:4–:7, 27:19. Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       14\n\fHurdle calculated the plaintiff’s total cost of future care as between $90,434 (if the plaintiff uses\n\nin-home hospice care) and $111,889 (if the plaintiff uses inpatient hospice care). Id. at 37:12–\n\n13.\n\n                       g)      William McLaurin Bethea Jr., M.D.\n\n       Dr. Bethea is board-certified in internal medicine and practiced in Norfolk Virginia from\n\n1977 until his retirement in 2012. Def.’s Ex. 24, at 2 (Dr. Bethea’s CV). Dr. Bethea testified as\n\na defense expert witness regarding the national standard of care regarding a family medicine\n\ndoctor’s responsibility to investigate and diagnose a patient’s complaints for breast cancer. Dr.\n\nBethea opined that Dr. Hill-Daniel satisfied the national standard of care at the plaintiff’s first\n\nvisit for breast complaints in December 2009 by reassuring her of the benign nature of her\n\nconcerns, advising her to change her bra, and prescribing pain medication, and that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel also satisfied the national standard of care in her treatment of the plaintiff at subsequent\n\nvisits in early 2010 when she did not ask the plaintiff about the status of any breast complaints.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 21:12–:19, 35:21–36:10. He also testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not\n\ndeviate from the standard of care after the plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 visit, when Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel palpated a mass in the plaintiff’s left breast and lymph nodes under her left armpit,\n\ndespite permitting five-months to elapse between the visit and the diagnosis of breast cancer,\n\nalthough he conceded that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s treatment at that time did not meet best practices.\n\nId. at 40:14–45:23.\n\n                       h)      Edward Graeme Koch, M.D.\n\n       Dr. Koch is board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology. Def.’s Ex. 25, at 1(Dr. Koch’s\n\nCV). He has practiced as an obstetrician and gynecologist since 1975 and currently contracts as\n\na gynecologist at the OB/GYN department of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      15\n\fand has a private gynecology practice. Id.; see also Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 66:21–68:7. Dr.\n\nKoch testified as a defense expert witness regarding the national standard of care for a family\n\nmedicine physician to assess and diagnose a patient’s breast complaints. Dr. Koch opined that\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel did not deviate from the applicable standard of care by treating the plaintiff’s\n\nsymptoms at the December 3, 2009 visit and ensuring the plaintiff that the symptoms were\n\nbenign, by not following-up on the plaintiff’s breast complaints at her subsequent visits, by\n\nordering a six week follow-up period after referring the plaintiff for a diagnostic ultrasound, and\n\nby then proceeding to order a mammogram and a biopsy in that progression. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n73 at 76:9–79:6, 85:5–:18, 95:20–98:14, 99:1–105:9.\n\n                       i)      John M. Feigert, M.D.\n\n       Dr. Feigert is a hematologist oncologist who is board-certified in internal medicine,\n\nhematology, and oncology. Def.’s Ex. 26, at 1(Dr. Feigert’s CV); see also Trial Tr.

Dr. Feigert testified as a defense expert on the character,\n\nqualities, staging, and prognosis of breast cancer. Dr. Feigert opined that as of December 3,\n\n2009, the plaintiff’s cancer was at least Stage III-B because it had already infiltrated her skin,\n\nand that it was likely Stage IV because it had probably also metastasized into her bone. Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 57 at 30:13–:18. He also testified that, based upon his opinion about the staging of the\n\nplaintiff’s cancer, if diagnosed in December 2009, the plaintiff’s chance of survival would have\n\nbeen less than 50%. Id. at 61:10–:25.\n\n       B.      CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT\n\n1. The majority of the witnesses who provided testimony during the bench trial were expert\n\n   witnesses and the plaintiff’s treating physicians. The witnesses generally testified credibly.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     16\n\f   Ms. Jones, Dr. Lapp, and Ms. Williams also testified as non-party fact witnesses and they\n\n   presented the facts of which they had first-hand knowledge in a frank and candid manner.\n\n2. The Court found the plaintiff to be entirely credible. Her testimony was consistent. For\n\n   example, despite a lengthy and aggressive cross-examination about how long she had been\n\n   feeling knots in her breast when she visited Dr. Hill-Daniel in December 2009, her\n\n   recollection that she only began feeling them around the time of that visit never wavered.\n\n   See Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 108:24–109:1 (“Q: Did you tell [Dr. Hill-Daniel] that you had\n\n   been having the knot for three years before [December 3, 2009]? A: No.”); id. at 113:6–:9\n\n   (“So, if you went back to Fort Washington in August 2010, and if we are counting back three\n\n   years from 2010, would you agree that you knew about those knots in 2007? A: No, I did not\n\n   know about the knots in 2007.”); id. at 113:11–:15 (Responding to a question from defense\n\n   counsel about whether she testified at her deposition that she had been feeling the knots for\n\n   three years prior to the December 3, 2009, visit, the plaintiff replied “I mean, I probably\n\n   didn’t understand the question. But I know in 2007, I did not have no knots on my left\n\n   breast. . . . I mean, I wouldn’t agree that I had the knots in 2006 because I know I didn’t\n\n   have no knots in 2006.”); Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 43:6–44:1 (On redirect, the plaintiff’s\n\n   counsel quoted this passage from the deposition transcript: “Question: Right. But you told\n\n   them that you had them for three years? This is August of 2010. Answer: I had the knot\n\n   when I seen Dr. Hill-Daniel, so more, I mean came at that time. [Question:] Did you have\n\n   those lumps for three years prior to August of 2010? Answer: Not that I recall. I had them\n\n   at the time I went to see Hill-Daniel. So I don’t know if they – it wasn’t there before I went\n\n   to see her, like the first visit I complained about the knot. [Question:] You had them before\n\n   that? . . . Answer: No, I didn’t. The first time that I seen, actually seen the knot was the first\n\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\f   time I visited her in December of 2009. Question: And you – your testimony is that you did\n\n   not have any lumps in your breast prior to December of 2009? Answer: I had – I haven’t\n\n   had no lumps before – I mean before that December visit that I know of.”). All the while, the\n\n   plaintiff’s demeanor was firm, but not defensive.\n\n3. Furthermore, despite an unexplained lapse in memory regarding her visit to the emergency\n\n   room at Howard University Hospital on May 19, 2010, the plaintiff was forthcoming and\n\n   straightforward. She readily admitted when she did not personally remember an event, and\n\n   she did not appear to substitute speculation about what might have occurred for actual\n\n   memory. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 82:19–:23 (“The Court: Were you, during [the\n\n   January 8, 2010] visit, still having pain and tenderness in your breasts? Do you recall? The\n\n   Witness: I don’t remember at that time. But I know I just remembered what she told me\n\n   about the problems that I had with the knot and the pain in my left breast.”); id. at 83:15–:25\n\n   (“Q: Let’s talk about the April 30th, 2010 visit with Dr. Hill-Daniel. Do you recall going to\n\n   see Dr. Hill-Daniel on this date for a checkup and problems with your eyes? A: Yes. Q:\n\n   Okay. At that time, do you recall if Dr. Hill-Daniel asked you if you were having any\n\n   problems with your breasts? A: No. Q: Were you having any problems with your breasts?\n\n   A: Actually, no. Q: Was the knot still present? A: It was the same thing as from the first\n\n   visit in 2009.”).\n\n4. The Court also found Dr. Hill-Daniel to be credible in some areas and not in others. Despite\n\n   Dr. Hill-Daniel’s insistence that she remembered her encounters with the plaintiff first-hand,\n\n   it was clear to the Court that her memory of the events giving rise to this case – particularly\n\n   those that took place in 2009 and early 2010 – was based on what was written in the patient\n\n   progress notes, and generalizations about her patients. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n\n\n\n                                                    18\n\f50:13–:24 (“Q: Do you recall testifying in your deposition that you had no recall of\n\nconversations that were not recorded in the medical records? Do you recall giving that\n\ntestimony? A: At the beginning of the deposition, yes, I said I didn’t recall other than what\n\nwas in the chart. But by the end of the deposition, even [the plaintiff’s counsel] noted that I\n\ndid recall other instances with more interactions with [the plaintiff] than came out during the\n\ndeposition. Q: And apparently since the deposition, you’ve had further recall about the\n\nconversations that you had with [the plaintiff]; is that accurate to say? A: Yes.”). Dr. Hill\n\nDaniel sees an average of twenty to twenty-two patients per day, five days per week, Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 71 at 65:6–8; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 88:2–14, and there was nothing about the\n\nplaintiff’s December 2009, January 2010, or April 2010 visits that seemed particularly\n\nnotable to Dr. Hill-Daniel at the time. Moreover, when asked questions about what happened\n\nduring the plaintiff’s various visits, Dr. Hill-Daniel often responded by referring to what was\n\nwritten in the progress note. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 4:6–:12 (“Q: And what\n\nhistory did the patient give you [on December 3, 2009]? A: As noted in the chart, [the\n\nplaintiff] came in with . . . .”); id. at 20:13–:17 (“Q: What course of action did you take to\n\nresolve the complaints [at the January 8, 2010 visit]? A: Well, as you see from the history,\n\nwhen someone comes in basically questioning fertility, we do counseling for family\n\nplanning.”). Sometimes Dr. Hill-Daniel responded to questions about her interactions with\n\nthe plaintiff by referring to her general practices. See, e.g., id. at 10:3–:15 (Q: Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel, would you show us how you did the physical examination of Ms. Rhodes’ breasts?\n\nHow did you examine her breasts? . . . A: Sure. To do a clinical breast exam, we ask the\n\nwoman to disrobe from the waist up. So, I asked her to take her shirt and her bra off . . . .\n\nWhen I came in the room, I have the patient sit on the examination table. The first part of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f   exam is observation. So, I look at her breasts while she is sitting . . . . And then I have the\n\n   patient lie supine on the table and I begin the exam.”). These characteristics cast some doubt\n\n   on the credibility of Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony regarding details of the plaintiff’s early visits\n\n   that were not recorded in the progress notes, and the Court has some concern that her\n\n   testimony about those visits was based on wishful speculation rather than personal memory.\n\n5. In addition, Dr. Hill-Daniel displayed some signs of dissembling, such as the evasive nature\n\n   of her answers to questions about whether she was or was not the plaintiff’s primary care\n\n   physician, see, e.g., id. at 48:3–:15 (stating that “as I stated before in my deposition, at the\n\n   time I didn’t necessarily consider her my patient,” but conceding that in accordance with\n\n   Unity policy, “I would have considered her my patient by then”), and her inadequate\n\n   explanations about certain notations in the plaintiff’s medical records, see, e.g., id. at 6:19–\n\n   7:10 (asked by the Court why she wrote “no history of cancer in first degree relatives”\n\n   despite her testimony that she asked Ms. Rhodes “if she had any family history of breast\n\n   cancer,” Dr. Hill-Daniel responded with an explanation of the medical significance of family\n\n   history in first-degree relatives and stated “So, it’s very, I guess for myself, I wanted to be\n\n   clear of what she is saying, that even though she is saying that there is no family history, but\n\n   there’s definitely – she’s definitely denying any first degree relative”).\n\n       C.      PLAINTIFF’S BACKGROUND\n\n1. At the time of the bench trial, the plaintiff was 27-years old. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   6:2–:5. She is a high school graduate, id. at 6:12–:15, who was employed as a food service\n\n   worker at United Medical Center from 2009 until March 2013. Id. 6:8–:11, 104:8–13. She\n\n   stopped working in March 2013 because the pain she experienced from her breast cancer,\n\n   which had metastasized to her bones, prevented her from standing for the amount of time her\n\n\n\n\n                                                     20\n\f   job required. Id. 103:14–104:1. Since then, she has interviewed for other jobs, id. 103:5–:7,\n\n   and she was recently hired by a cleaning company, id. 103:7–:9. At the time of the bench\n\n   trial, she was waiting for that job offer to be finalized. Id. She is not married and has two\n\n   children, who at the time of the bench trial were eight and nine years old. Id. 75:4–:11.\n\n2. Both of the plaintiff’s grandmothers were diagnosed with breast cancer before the events that\n\n   gave rise to this action. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 75:21–76:11. Her paternal grandmother\n\n   died of breast cancer in 1994, id. at 76:1–:6, and her maternal grandmother was diagnosed\n\n   with breast cancer in her thirties and was living at the time of trial, id. at 76:5–:11.\n\n       D.      DR. HILL-DANIEL’S PRACTICE AND UNITY PROCEDURES\n\n1. Dr. Hill-Daniel sees an average of about twenty to twenty-two patients per day as a family\n\n   practice physician at the Congress Heights location of Unity. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 65:6–\n\n   :8; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 88:2–:14. Each patient is allotted a fifteen-minute visit. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 71 at 65:11–:12. Dr. Hill-Daniel performs breast exams regularly as part of the\n\n   annual exams for women, called “well-woman visits,” and when a patient has a specific\n\n   breast complaint. Id. at 66:6–:8, 73:7–:10. It is very rare for Dr. Hill-Daniel to see a woman\n\n   under the age of thirty for a specific breast complaint. Id. at 66:9–:11.\n\n2. Dr. Lapp, a representative of Unity, testified that when a patient first comes in to the\n\n   Congress Heights location of Unity, the patient is seen by a registration assistant, and then\n\n   speaks with a medical assistant before seeing the provider. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 84:5–:9.\n\n   The registration assistant records information related to the visit – i.e. type of visit,\n\n   established patient or new patient – in the electronic medical record under “reason for\n\n   appointment.” Id. at 84:22–85:5. The patient then sees a medical assistant, who asks why\n\n   the patient has come in for a visit and records the patient’s answer in the electronic medical\n\n\n\n\n                                                      21\n\f   record, also under “reason for appointment.” Id. at 85:5–:7. Dr. Lapp testified that\n\n   communication between the medical assistant and the physician is largely done electronically\n\n   or by paper, id. at 85:20–86:3, and that by the time the physician sees the patient, the medical\n\n   assistant has already turned to the next patient. Id. at 86:4–:13.\n\n3. Dr. Hill-Daniel first saw the plaintiff as a patient for a well-woman visit on July 25, 2008.\n\n   Def.’s Ex. 1, at 3; Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 73:5–:12. Dr. Hill-Daniel saw the plaintiff again\n\n   in September 2008, April 2009, and August 2009 for complaints unrelated to the plaintiff’s\n\n   breasts. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 4–6; Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 75:9–:22, 76:10–:17, 77:6–:19. Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel testified that although the plaintiff was never formally assigned as a patient to Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel, doctors at Unity assume the role of primary care physician for a particular\n\n   patient after seeing the patient three times. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 48:18–:21. By the time\n\n   of the plaintiff’s December 2009 visit to the Unity clinic, Dr. Hill-Daniel had seen her at least\n\n   four separate times. Id. at 48:22–25.\n\n       E.      THE PLAINTIFF’S VISIT WITH DR. HILL-DANIEL ON DECEMBER 3,\n               2009\n\n1. The plaintiff visited the Congress Heights location of Unity on December 3, 2009, for a\n\n   scheduled visit with Dr. Hill-Daniel. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 78:17–:25; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066.\n\n   There is some dispute as to whether the plaintiff told the Unity healthcare providers that she\n\n   felt a knot specifically in her left breast or whether she described feeling knots in both\n\n   breasts.\n\n       a) The plaintiff testified that she told Dr. Hill-Daniel that she had soreness and\n\n            tenderness in both of her breasts, and a pain and a knot in her left breast. Trial Tr.\n\n            ECF No. 55 at 78:12–:16 (the plaintiff’s testimony that the reason for her visit was\n\n            “soreness and tenderness in both of [her] breasts and pain and a knot in [her] left\n\n\n\n                                                      22\n\f   breast”); see also id. at 17:19–:22. She testified that the pain had started about a\n\n   month before the appointment. Id. at 78:20–79:2. There is no dispute that the\n\n   plaintiff asked Dr. Hill-Daniel for a mammogram. Id. at 78:14–:15 (plaintiff’s\n\n   testimony that she asked Dr. Hill-Daniel for a mammogram); Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n   13:23–:24 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony that at the December 3, 2009 appointment, the\n\n   plaintiff asked her “if she needed a mammogram for her complaint”).\n\nb) Dr. Hill-Daniel denied that the plaintiff complained of a knot in the left breast, but\n\n   testified that she complained that both breasts were sore and had knots in them. Trial\n\n   Tr. ECF No. 58 at 4:7–:12 (“[The plaintiff] held under her breasts and basically just\n\n   motioned that both breasts were tender and felt lumpy.”). According to Dr. Hill-\n\n   Daniel, she specifically asked if there was any particular place where the plaintiff felt\n\n   the “knot,” and the plaintiff did not identify any specific location. Id. at 18:18–:23\n\n   (“So, during the course of our exam, I asked her, you know, is there a particular\n\n   place, you know, where do you feel the knot? And she couldn’t give me any specific\n\n   place. And when I asked her, she just, again, said, they’re all over. So basically\n\n   saying that both breasts felt sore and knots in them, not one specific knot.”).\n\nc) The Unity progress note for the plaintiff’s December 3, 2009 visit lists as the reason\n\n   for appointment as “1. Medical – Adult Est Patient 2. Sore, tender breasts 3. Knots in\n\n   them.” Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1013. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that the\n\n   individual who recorded the plaintiff’s “reason for appointment” was the medical\n\n   assistant with whom she was working on December 3, 2009. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n   3:17–:21. The progress note for the December 3, 2009, visit also contains Dr. Hill-\n\n   Daniel’s notes, which stated in pertinent part: “Patient presents for new complaint of\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f           breast tenderness and lumpiness. Pt states tender all the time denies pregnancy and\n\n           no change with menstrual cycle. Pt also concerned that breast are [sic] lumpy.”\n\n           Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Pl.’s Ex. 1 at 1013.\n\n2. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that her note “tender all the time” meant to her that the patient did\n\n   not feel pain that is waxing and waning. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 6:3–6 (“[I]t’s not waxing\n\n   and waning, the pain is not in the morning versus in the evening. She is specifically saying\n\n   that she feels uncomfortable all the time with the pain.”). She further interpreted her note,\n\n   “no change with menstrual cycle,” explaining this meant that there was no change in the\n\n   symptoms associated with the patient’s menstrual cycle, and her observation that the plaintiff\n\n   was menstruating during the time of the visit. Id. at 5:15–:21.\n\n3. The defendant disputes whether the plaintiff told Dr. Hill-Daniel or the medical assistant\n\n   about her family history of breast cancer, and whether Dr. Hill-Daniel asked the plaintiff\n\n   about her family history of breast cancer beyond her first-degree relatives.\n\n       a) The plaintiff testified emphatically that, at the December 3, 2009 appointment, she\n\n           told one of the health care providers with whom she spoke about her family history of\n\n           breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 79:13–:16 (“Q: And you mentioned that you\n\n           had discussion with Dr. Hill-Daniel about cancer. Would you describe for us what\n\n           the nature of the discussion was? A: I told her I had two grandmothers that had\n\n           breast cancer.”), 128:17–:18 (“Yes, I told them at Unity that I had a family history of\n\n           breast cancer.”), 129:5–:6 (“I told them numerous times when I was, when I seen the\n\n           nurse before I seen Dr. Hill-Daniel.”). Indeed, the plaintiff explained that the fact that\n\n           both her grandmothers suffered from breast cancer worried her when she felt a knot in\n\n\n\n\n                                                      24\n\f           her breast and is the reason that she made the appointment to see Dr. Hill-Daniel in\n\n           December 2009 and expressly requested a mammogram. Id. at 78:11–:16.\n\n       b) The note prepared by the medical assistant makes no mention of the plaintiff’s\n\n           grandmothers’ breast cancer. The progress report from the December 3, 2009\n\n           appointment prepared by Dr. Hill-Daniel states only that “Pt denies family hx of\n\n           breast ca in first degree relative.” Def.’s Ex. 1 at 8. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that the\n\n           first-degree relative is “a mother, sister, father.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 6:17. A\n\n           grandparent is a second degree relative. Id. at 7:14.\n\n       c) Although Dr. Hill-Daniel’s progress note indicates information only about cancer in a\n\n           “first-degree relative,” Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she recalls asking the plaintiff\n\n           more broadly whether she had any family history of breast cancer, to which the\n\n           plaintiff said “no.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 6:4–:5.\n\n4. Dr. Hill-Daniel performed a clinical breast exam on the plaintiff, which the plaintiff\n\n   described as “a quick pat-down,” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 79:4–:9; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n   9:16–:20, and found no abnormalities, Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 62:6–:9. Dr. Hill-Daniel did\n\n   not feel, or palpate, a mass in the plaintiff’s breast or her lymph nodes during the exam, nor\n\n   did she find any retractions. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at\n\n   58:7–:15. A retraction looks like a pucker in the skin, and can be a symptom of breast cancer\n\n   if the cancer is close to the skin. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 58:7–:15. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified\n\n   that she did not write down any differential diagnosis – the list of possible diagnoses – in the\n\n   progress note. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 15:1–16:7. Nevertheless, she testified that her top\n\n   two possible diagnoses were fibrocystic changes related to hormones and underwire bra. Id.\n\n   at 55:15–:17. The term “fibrocystic changes,” also called fibrocystic disease, means normal\n\n\n\n\n                                                     25\n\f   breast tissue that is tender and feels lumpy due to hormonal changes with a woman’s\n\n   menstrual cycle. Id. at 56:14–:17. Dr. Hill-Daniel acknowledged, however, that she did not\n\n   record “fibrocystic changes” as her diagnosis on the progress note; rather, she entered the\n\n   diagnostic code “breast disorder not otherwise specified.” Id. at 13:2–:22; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at\n\n   1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that breast cancer was not on her\n\n   differential diagnosis. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 55:11–:14.\n\n5. The plaintiff testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel told her that she was too young to have breast\n\n   cancer and too young for a mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 79:10–:19. Dr. Hill\n\n   Daniel denied telling the plaintiff that she was too young to have breast cancer, Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 58 at 14:18–:24, but acknowledged that she reassured the plaintiff that her concerns were\n\n   benign, id. at 13:21–:22. The progress note reflects that Dr. Hill-Daniel “reassured [the\n\n   plaintiff] about the benign nature of her concern” and determined that “no imaging [was]\n\n   warranted at this time.” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n   recommended that the plaintiff change her bra to non-underwire, and prescribed 800 mg of\n\n   Ibuprofen three times per day with one refill. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 14:5–:9.\n\n6. On the progress note, the letters “PRN,” which means “as needed,” are written under the title\n\n   “follow-up.” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 16:8–:9. Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel testified that she asked the plaintiff “to follow up if she didn’t have any relief of\n\n   the pain, or if her symptoms persisted.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 16:12–18. She did not\n\n   schedule or direct the plaintiff to return for a follow-up appointment within any specific time\n\n   frame. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 61:15–:23. The plaintiff testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel never\n\n   told her that she should follow-up under any circumstances. Id. at 20:22–21:7.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     26\n\f7. The standard of care experts disagreed as to what the national standard of care required Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel to do for a patient presenting with the plaintiff’s symptoms.\n\n       a) The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Sutherland, testified that when a patient presents\n\n           complaining of a knot in one breast and noncyclic pain, and with a family history of\n\n           two grandmothers with breast cancer, the national standard of care for a family care\n\n           doctor requires the doctor to order diagnostic imaging, even if the doctor does not\n\n           palpate a mass. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 47:12–:23. At the very least, the national\n\n           standard of care requires the doctor to schedule a follow-up visit for the patient thirty\n\n           to sixty days later to determine whether the symptoms persist and still warrant\n\n           imaging. Id. at 37:19–:24.\n\n       b) The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Margo, testified that when a patient presents complaining\n\n           of a palpable lump, tenderness and pain – even if the doctor does not feel a mass\n\n           herself – the national standard of care for a family care doctor requires the doctor to\n\n           include breast cancer in her differential diagnosis and schedule a follow-up visit for\n\n           the patient for four to six weeks later to ensure that the problem has gone away and to\n\n           reexamine the patient at a different stage in her menstrual cycle. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n           70 at 60:22–61:2 (“[T]he national standard required her to make sure she had a\n\n           follow-up visit to make sure the problem went away and that she informed the patient\n\n           of the possibility that this wasn’t benign, that maybe it probably was, but that we\n\n           can’t be sure until we follow it through.”), 61:15–62:3 (“Q: And what specific\n\n           follow-up was Dr. Hill-Daniel required to order? A: To make sure she had an\n\n           appointment to follow up in the next four to six weeks.”), 64:4–:8 (“[B]reast cancer\n\n           has to be on the diagnosis since that’s the most dangerous thing to miss.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    27\n\f   According to Dr. Margo, the national standard of care does not require the doctor\n\n   under those circumstances to order imaging before the follow-up visit. Id. at 62:24–\n\n   63:2.\n\nc) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified because the patient was a twenty-four\n\n   year old woman presenting with soreness and knots in both breasts, and upon\n\n   examination the physician felt no masses, but made “bilateral fibrocystic findings,”\n\n   Dr. Hill-Daniel met the national standard of care for a family practice physician by\n\n   prescribing pain medication and a different bra. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 22:9–:11,\n\n   30:14–:24. He testified that under those circumstances, the national standard of care\n\n   for a family practice physician does not require referral for imaging. Id. at 29:21–\n\n   30:5. He also testified that it would be inappropriate to list cancer on the differential\n\n   diagnosis because cancer would be “so far down on the list of probabilities.” Id. at\n\n   31:24–32:14.\n\nd) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Koch, testified that because the patient is a twenty-four\n\n   year old woman complaining of “sore, tender breasts, plural . . . and she feels knots in\n\n   them,” has no family history of breast cancer, and upon physical examination the\n\n   physician finds no masses, no retractions, and no lymph nodes, Dr. Hill-Daniel met\n\n   the national standard of care by advising the patient to change the type of bra she\n\n   wears, prescribing pain medication, and asking her to follow up if the problem does\n\n   not go away. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 77:9–79:3, 83:2–:18, 86:19–87:7. He testified\n\n   that under those circumstances, the national standard of care for a family practice\n\n   physician does not require referral for imaging. Id. at 80:1–:3, 85:10–86:17. He also\n\n   testified on cross-examination, in concurrence with the plaintiff’s experts, that it\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f            would violate the national standard of care for a physician under those circumstances\n\n            not to tell the patient to come back if the breast problems continue. Id. at 128:8–:17.\n\n            Moreover, in further concurrence with the plaintiff’s experts, Dr. Koch opined that if\n\n            a patient presents with bilateral tenderness in her breast and a discrete lump or knot,\n\n            and pain in one breast, and the physician could not feel the lump, the national\n\n            standard of care would require the physician to bring the patient back within six\n\n            weeks to three months for follow-up. Id. at 129:3–:25.\n\n       F.      THE PLAINTIFF’S MEDICAL HISTORY FROM JANUARY 2009 TO\n               AUGUST 2010\n\n1. The plaintiff returned to Unity on January 8, 2010 – thirty-six days after her December 3,\n\n   2009 visit – for an appointment with Dr. Hill-Daniel regarding fertility issues. Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   no. 58 at 19:12–:14, 20:8–:12; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1064; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 9. Dr. Hill-Daniel did not\n\n   ask the plaintiff about her breast symptoms during that visit or examine her breasts. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 21:7–:9, 71:25–72:11. The Ibuprofen prescribed by Dr. Hill-Daniel for the\n\n   plaintiff at the previous appointment appears on the progress note for the January 8, 2010\n\n   visit as a “current medication,” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1064; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 9, and Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n   testified that she was aware that the plaintiff was continuing to take the Ibuprofen. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 19:12–:14, 20:8–:12.\n\n2. The plaintiff returned to Unity again on April 30, 2010, for a check-up and for problems with\n\n   her eyes. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1062; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 11. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she did not\n\n   recall any conversation with the plaintiff about her breasts during that visit, Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 58 at 21:17–22:18, 48:17–:25. She also testified that during that visit, she did not\n\n   specifically ask the plaintiff if she was having problems with her breasts, Trial Tr. 53:17–:22,\n\n   although she testified from recollection that she did ask the plaintiff if she had any other\n\n\n\n                                                     29\n\f   issues or complaints, to which the plaintiff responded “no,” id. at 23:2–:4. The plaintiff’s\n\n   testimony confirmed that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not inquire about her breasts at this follow-up\n\n   visit: when asked if she recalled whether Dr. Hill-Daniel asked her if she was having any\n\n   problems with her breasts at the April 30, 2010 visit, the plaintiff responded, “no.” Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 55 at 83:15–:21.\n\n3. On May 19, 2010, the plaintiff was seen by an emergency physician, Dr. Carter, at Howard\n\n   University Hospital. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23061; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 68; Trial Tr. ECF No. 72\n\n   116:5–:11. The chief complaint as documented on the record for that visit is “knot on l[ef]t\n\n   breast,” Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23061; Def.’s Ex. 3. The medical history recorded by Dr. Carter\n\n   included “left breast tenderness for greater than a year,” and indicated that the pain was\n\n   “continual.” Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 69; Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 119:11–:12,\n\n   119:21–:24. Dr. Carter’s notes also state that he found no discharge from the nipple, no\n\n   warmth, and no redness – meaning no signs of infection. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s Ex.\n\n   3, at 69; Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 122:18–123:2. There is no indication in the notes that the\n\n   plaintiff had any ulcerations or skin nodules on her breasts. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s\n\n   Ex. 3, at 69. Dr. Carter testified that he palpated the plaintiff’s breasts and found tender cysts\n\n   in both breasts, with one large tender cyst in the left breast, and tenderness in both breasts.\n\n   Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 123:5–:8, 134:2–:5. Dr. Carter documented the results of the exam\n\n   with a diagram in the patient record. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 69. Dr. Carter\n\n   testified that he wrote, “Patient advised to follow up with primary care provider for full\n\n   evaluation, possible biopsy” in the plaintiff’s record, which means that he probably told the\n\n   plaintiff to see her primary care doctor and get a further workup. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at\n\n   123:7–:8, 124:1–:18; Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 69. He prescribed 800mg of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    30\n\f   Motrin and Tylenol with Codeine. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23065; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 72. The plaintiff\n\n   signed the discharge form and was given a copy to take home. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23065;\n\n   Def.’s Ex. 3, at 72; Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 135:12–:16. Among the “additional notes”\n\n   written on the discharge form was, “Follow up with your primary care doctor.” Pl.’s Ex.\n\n   104, at 23065; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 72. The plaintiff testified that she did not remember this visit\n\n   to Howard University Hospital. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 84:6–:8 (“Q: Do you recall going to\n\n   Howard University Hospital on May 19th, 2010? A: I don’t remember that visit.”); id. at\n\n   87:22–:25 (“The Court: Now, Ms. Rhodes, it’s clear from your responses to the last several\n\n   questions that you don’t have a memory of going to Howard on May 19th, 2010, right? A:\n\n   Right.”).\n\n4. On August 9, 2010, the plaintiff visited the emergency room at Fort Washington Hospital.\n\n   Pl.’s Ex. 6, at 6003. The patient record for the plaintiff’s visit, which was completed by a\n\n   health care provider, lists her complaint as “knot in left breast x 3 years.” Id. The plaintiff\n\n   testified that she went to Fort Washington because she “had soreness and tenderness in [her]\n\n   breast and pain and a knot in [her] left breast.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 89:21–:24. She\n\n   further testified that she did not recall telling anyone that the knots had been present for three\n\n   years, and that the knots had only been present since 2009. Id. at 89:21–:24, 90:6–:8.\n\n   According to the plaintiff, the emergency room doctors at Fort Washington Hospital told her\n\n   to set up an appointment with her primary care doctor for a mammogram because something\n\n   very serious was going on with her left breast. Id. at 90:12–:18. The discharge paper from\n\n   that visit lists the diagnosis as “left breast lumps,” and under “discharge instructions,” is\n\n   written, “you need f/u for further evaluation. Very important.” Pl.’s Ex. 6, at 6002, 6004.\n\n   The plaintiff testified that this was the first time that a doctor had told her to schedule an\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\f   appointment for a mammogram and that it was important to do so. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   91:22–:25.\n\n       G.       PLAINTIFF’S VISIT WITH DR. HILL-DANIEL ON OCTOBER 18, 2010\n\n1. On August 10, 2010 – the day after her visit to Fort Washington Hospital – the plaintiff\n\n   called Unity and asked for the first available appointment to see Dr. Hill-Daniel because she\n\n   needed a mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 92:1–:13. She was given an appointment for\n\n   September 9, 2010. Pl.’s Ex. 33. Unity cancelled that appointment shortly before it was\n\n   scheduled to take place because Dr. Hill-Daniel was scheduled to be on hospital rounds that\n\n   week. Pl.’s Ex. 33; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 25:2–:16, 107:21–22. Unity rescheduled the\n\n   appointment for September 24, 2010. Pl.’s Ex. 33. The September 24, 2010 appointment\n\n   was also cancelled by Unity. Pl.’s Ex. 33; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 25:2–19, 107:24–108:4.\n\n   Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that Unity cancelled the appointment on the day it was scheduled to\n\n   take place because she was called to the hospital. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 25:17–:19. Unity\n\n   rescheduled the appointment for October 18, 2010. Pl.’s Ex. 33. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified\n\n   that the plaintiff could have seen another doctor or come in to Unity as a walk-in patient if\n\n   she did not want to wait to see Dr. Hill-Daniel. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 25:25–26:15. The\n\n   defendant presented no evidence that the plaintiff was told that these options were available\n\n   to her at the time, nor did the defendant present any evidence that the personnel at Unity,\n\n   who spoke to the plaintiff about the original or the re-scheduled appointments, made any\n\n   inquiry about why the plaintiff was requesting an mammogram as soon as possible in order\n\n   to evaluate the urgency of the need for an appointment.\n\n2. The plaintiff was seen by Dr. Hill-Daniel on October 18, 2010, more than two months after\n\n   her initial call to Unity to schedule an appointment. Pl.’s Ex. 33. The Unity progress note\n\n\n\n\n                                                   32\n\f   for that appointment and Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony reflect that the plaintiff presented with a\n\n   “new complaint of bumps in her breast,” and that the plaintiff could feel bumps in her left\n\n   breast that had been getting bigger. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 24:15–:18.\n\n   The progress note also reflects that the plaintiff had been seen in the emergency room\n\n   regarding the bumps and that she was told to follow up with her doctor to get a referral for a\n\n   mammogram. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 24:18–:21. The plaintiff testified\n\n   that she showed the papers from Fort Washington Hospital to Dr. Hill-Daniel “for her\n\n   actually to believe me about what I was saying about my breasts . . . because they had seen\n\n   something on my breasts that she didn’t see, for me to get a mammogram.” Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 55 at 96:1–:10.\n\n3. At the October 18, 2010, visit, Dr. Hill-Daniel performed a breast exam and palpated\n\n   multiple nodules in the plaintiff’s left breast and an enlarged lymph node in her left axilla\n\n   (under her armpit). Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 27:10–:15; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n   also observed multiple scars on the left breast, some of which were overlying nodules. Trial\n\n   Tr. ECF No. 58 at 27:10–:13; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that an enlarged\n\n   lymph node can be a sign of infection or breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 27:16–:25.\n\n   She also testified that she was not sure if the plaintiff had an infection, abscess, or cancer, but\n\n   that she found no indication of any infection, such as drainage from the site, fever, or chills.\n\n   Id. 28:2–:4, 28:10–:13. The assessment or diagnosis that Dr. Hill-Daniel wrote on the\n\n   progress note was “breast neoplasm not otherwise specified.” Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12.\n\n4. Dr. Hill-Daniel ordered a referral for the plaintiff to get a breast ultrasound. Def.’s Ex. 1, at\n\n   12. The progress note for the October 18, 2010 appointment reflects a “follow up”\n\n   timeframe of six weeks. Id. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she “felt six weeks was enough\n\n\n\n\n                                                     33\n\f   time for [the plaintiff] to get the referral, make her appointments, get the exam done, and\n\n   report back to [her].” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:3–:5.\n\n5. The parties dispute whether Dr. Hill-Daniel discussed the urgency of obtaining an ultrasound\n\n   with the plaintiff.\n\n       a) Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she “basically stressed the importance of her to get the\n\n            study done and come back to me for the results so we could figure out what else we\n\n            needed to do.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:1–:3; see also id. at 95:16–:18 (“I told her\n\n            that she needed to get [the ultrasound] done. And I told her, because of this I’m\n\n            going to give you the referral now so you can go ahead and schedule.”), 95:22–:24 (“I\n\n            told her that I didn’t know what the mass was, that she needs to get the ultrasound\n\n            done so we could figure out what was going on.”).\n\n       b) When asked whether Dr. Hill-Daniel told her how quickly she was supposed to have\n\n            the ultrasound performed, the plaintiff testified that she did not discuss the ultrasound\n\n            with her. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 97:3–:6 (“She didn’t give me no discussion about\n\n            the ultrasound.”). There is no indication on the progress note that Dr. Hill-Daniel told\n\n            the plaintiff why she needed an ultrasound or with what urgency. The plaintiff\n\n            emphasizes that this is significant because when Dr. Hill-Daniel counseled the\n\n            plaintiff that her complaints were “benign” during the December 3, 2009, visit, she\n\n            documented the conversation on the progress note. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1,\n\n            at 8.\n\n       H.       UNITY’S REFERRAL PROCESS\n\n1. The plaintiff was insured by D.C. Chartered Health Plan (“D.C. Chartered”) for the entire\n\n   period of time relevant to this action. See Pl.’s Ex. 55 (D.C. Chartered Health Plan referral\n\n\n\n\n                                                     34\n\f   verifications for Shilisa Rhodes). D.C. Chartered requires Unity to obtain an insurance\n\n   authorization, called a “DIVA,” before a patient can receive a referral for an ultrasound or\n\n   mammogram at Providence Hospital. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:21–24, 30:18–:24;\n\n   Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 144:8–:10. Unity employs care management support persons to\n\n   process referrals and obtain authorizations. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 9:11. Terita Jones is the\n\n   care management support person who works with Dr. Hill-Daniel, as well as three other\n\n   doctors, to process over fifty referrals each day. Id. at 14:12–:17, 26:3–:8. Ms. Jones\n\n   testified that the doctors send referral forms to her electronically. Id. at 14:12–:17, 16:9–:23.\n\n   She then prints out the form, called the “Unity Physician Referral” form (“Referral”), calls\n\n   the insurance company, and inputs the referral information by following the prompts on the\n\n   telephone. Id. at 18:13–:22. She then enters the authorization code on the Referral\n\n   electronically, and D.C. Chartered faxes the DIVA to her. Id. at 16:9–:23. The patient needs\n\n   to present both the Referral and the DIVA at Providence Hospital to obtain an ultrasound or\n\n   mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 30:18–:24.\n\n2. The Referral and the DIVA contain two numeric codes: the ICD-9 and the CPT. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 72 at 143:13–:15, 143:20–:24. The ICD-9 code corresponds to the diagnosis given\n\n   to the patient. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 30:5–:13. The CPT code corresponds to the medical\n\n   procedure being ordered. Id. at 30:14–:16. The codes on the DIVA and the Referral must\n\n   match; if they don’t match, the patient cannot have the procedure. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at\n\n   151:19–:25. The referring doctor is responsible for choosing the correct codes. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 102:21–103:1.\n\n3. The patient must pick up the DIVA and referral from the care management support person,\n\n   who in this case was Ms. Jones, and bring those forms to Providence at the time of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    35\n\f   scheduled referred procedure. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 30:18–:24. Sometimes Unity\n\n   provides the patient with the DIVA and referral on the same day as the patient’s visit, and\n\n   sometimes the patient has to return to Unity a few days later to pick the forms up. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 72 at 88:7–:11. The referring physician may mark a referral “urgent.” Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 44:25. In that case, the care management support person is supposed to take\n\n   the referral out of turn and work on it immediately to get the authorization, and provide the\n\n   patient with the forms quickly. Id. at 44:25–45:4. If the forms are prepared on a different\n\n   day than the patient’s visit with Unity, Ms. Jones calls the patient by phone to advise that the\n\n   forms are ready for pick-up. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 25:20–26:18. Ms. Jones does not\n\n   communicate with the patient about the urgency of the referred procedure and the scheduling\n\n   of the referred procedure with Providence or other health care facility remains the patient’s\n\n   responsibility. Id. at 27:2–:21, 88:7–:22.\n\n4. Marsha Williams, a Providence Hospital front desk registration clerk who schedules\n\n   appointments for diagnostic and screening mammograms and breast ultrasounds, testified\n\n   that in 2010, Providence Hospital kept a schedule of mammograms for up to a period of\n\n   ninety days into the future. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 156:11–:13. She also testified that the\n\n   scheduling clerk determines an available date for imaging studies, which depends upon the\n\n   urgency of the test. Id. at 144:11–:20. Ms. Williams testified that in 2010 and 2011,\n\n   ultrasounds were generally scheduled about a week out, mammograms about a day out, and\n\n   diagnostic mammograms, about two to three days out. Id. at 146:19–147:4. Ultrasounds\n\n   take longer to schedule because the technician works only 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., which\n\n   means that Providence is able to perform only five ultrasounds per day. Id. at 145:20–\n\n   146:11.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\f       I.     THE PLAINTIFF’S DIAGNOSTIC TESTS\n\n1. Dr. Hill-Daniel generated a referral for Ms. Jones to obtain an ultrasound at Providence\n\n   Hospital on the day of the plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 visit, and she asked Ms. Jones to\n\n   obtain the authorization so that the plaintiff could leave Unity with the Referral and DIVA\n\n   in-hand. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:8–:11; Def.’s Ex. 2, at 1. Ms. Jones was not instructed\n\n   to, and did not, tell the plaintiff anything about the urgency in making the ultrasound\n\n   appointment, how long she should take before making the appointment, or when the\n\n   appointment should be scheduled. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 67:7–:16. The Referral lists the\n\n   authorization end date for the ultrasound as January 16, 2011, or three months from the date\n\n   of the plaintiff’s October, 2010 visit. Id. at 68:6–:15. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12. The Referral\n\n   allows the patient to make an appointment between the date of issuance and the referral\n\n   verification authorization end date. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 121; Pl.’s Ex. 55, at 55004; Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 72 at 67:17–68:5.\n\n2. Providence Hospital does not have a record of when the plaintiff called to schedule her\n\n   ultrasound appointment, but it is undisputed that the appointment was scheduled for\n\n   November 3, 2010, at 10:30 a.m. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1059; Def.’s Ex. 2, at 3. The plaintiff went\n\n   to Providence Hospital that morning, but she was unable to have the ultrasound because the\n\n   Referral contained an IDC-9 code, which had been provided by Dr. Hill-Daniel, that was\n\n   incorrect. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 103:2–:13; ECF No. 72 at 145:7–:11, 157:13–:14. Ms.\n\n   Williams testified that the IDC-9 code on the plaintiff’s Referral was “239.3,” which is an\n\n   unspecific diagnosis code that Providence Hospital does not use because it does not tell the\n\n   hospital exactly what is wrong with the patient. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 157:18–158:9. Ms.\n\n   Williams called Unity at 10:30 a.m. that day and spoke with Ms. Jones. Id. at 22:14–:23;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   37\n\f   Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1059. She told Ms. Jones that the plaintiff was at Providence Hospital, and that\n\n   the ICD-9 code needed to be changed for the plaintiff to get the ultrasound. Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 72 at 22:15–:16.\n\n3. Ms. Jones testified that she notified Dr. Hill-Daniel about the need for the code change by\n\n   sending her an electronic alert through the electronic records system, which signaled Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel that she had a message. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 23:13–24:3. The message\n\n   stated, “Patient is at appt ICD-9 code needs to be changed if you can please change code so\n\n   that pt can be seen her appt is at 10:30 tech person leaves at 11:00 am this is for mammo\n\n   procedure code should be 611.72.” Id. at 23:2–:10; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1059. Ms. Jones also\n\n   testified that she went to Dr. Hill-Daniel’s office to tell her that about the electronic alert, but\n\n   Dr. Hill-Daniel was not in her office. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 24:4–:10, 25:4–:11. Dr. Hill-\n\n   Daniel changed the code at 12:37 p.m. and sent the Referral back to Ms. Jones. Id. at 24:11–\n\n   :18. Ms. Jones faxed the Referral and DIVA back to Providence sometime between 1:00\n\n   p.m. and 3:23 p.m. the same day. Id. at 29:15–30:8, 30:20–:25. By that time, however, the\n\n   technician at Providence Hospital had left for the day. Id. at 23:2–:10. After faxing the\n\n   referral and DIVA to Providence Hospital, Ms. Jones called the plaintiff and told her that the\n\n   Referral had been faxed to Providence Hospital and that she could pick up a copy from\n\n   Unity. Id. at 31:2–:16. Ms. Jones testified that it was necessary for the plaintiff to pick up\n\n   the Referral from Unity at that point because it had been faxed to Providence after 11:00 a.m.\n\n   Id. at 31:17–:21. The plaintiff picked up the referral the next day on November 4, 2010. Id.\n\n   at 34:4–:22.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      38\n\f4. The ultrasound was rescheduled for December 14, 2010, and was performed that day, almost\n\n   two full months after Dr. Hill-Daniel had palpated left breast lumps and an enlarged lymph\n\n   node. Pl.’s Ex. 13, at 1; Def.’s Ex. 5, at 1.\n\n5. The ultrasound report of December 14, 2010, describes the left breast as having a solid mass\n\n   at one o’clock, which corresponds to the palpable mass, small focal calcifications within the\n\n   mass, and small nodules in the breast tissues which correspond to dark skin lesions. Pl.’s Ex.\n\n   13, at 1; Def.’s Ex. 5, at 1. The report stated that “while the [large mass with calcifications]\n\n   may be a fibroadenoma, more aggressive lesion cannot be excluded.” Id. The radiologist\n\n   recommended a left mammogram and noted, “[u]nfortunately this exam cannot be authorized\n\n   at this time and needs to be scheduled.” Id. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she assumed the\n\n   radiologist meant that the plaintiff did not have the DIVA authorization necessary to perform\n\n   the recommended mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 39:22–40:4.\n\n6. Dr. Hill-Daniel received the ultrasound report in the mail almost two weeks later, on\n\n   December 27, 2010. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 41:7–8 She generated a referral for a\n\n   mammogram three days later, on December 30, 2010, sent it to Ms. Jones for authorization,\n\n   and asked Ms. Jones to call the plaintiff when it was ready. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 41:11–\n\n   :15. Although Dr. Hill-Daniel marked the Referral “urgent” on December 30, 2010 so the\n\n   authorization would be completed before the end of the day, the plaintiff was not notified that\n\n   it was ready for pick up until January 7, 2011, more than a week after Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n   approved the referral and more than three weeks after the ultrasound showed the possibility\n\n   of an “aggressive lesion.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 39:12–:25, 40:25–41:2.\n\n7. Ms. Jones did not receive the referral from Dr. Hill-Daniel until January 6, 2011, because she\n\n   had been on vacation from December 28, 2010 to January 5, 2011. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at\n\n\n\n\n                                                    39\n\f     36:3–:12. On January 6, 2011, at 4:18 p.m., Ms. Jones tried to get the DIVA authorization,\n\n     but was unsuccessful because the CPT code used by Dr. Hill-Daniel was, again, wrong. Id.\n\n     at 36:9–:25, 37:1–:12. The code could not be changed at that time because Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n     had already left for the day. Id. 36:23–37:9. Dr. Hill-Daniel corrected the code the following\n\n     day, January 7, 2011. Id. at 37:1–:12. The same day, the plaintiff was notified by phone that\n\n     the referral was ready to be picked up. Id. at 39:1–:7.\n\n8.   Dr. Hill-Daniel did not call the plaintiff or otherwise directly communicate with the plaintiff\n\n     about the mammogram referral. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 97:22–98:2, 99:10–:14. She did not\n\n     communicate the urgency of the need to get a mammogram to the plaintiff, did not tell Ms.\n\n     Jones to communicate the urgency to the plaintiff, and did not write anything on the\n\n     mammogram Referral that would indicate how quickly the mammogram should be done.\n\n     Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 98:3–99:9. The “urgent” notation that communicates the urgency of\n\n     processing the Referral to Ms. Jones does not appear on the forms that the patient receives.\n\n     Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 39:15–:25. Ms. Jones also did not communicate to the plaintiff about\n\n     the urgency of obtaining the mammogram. Id. at 40:18–:23. The Referral for the\n\n     mammogram listed the authorization end date as October 18, 2011, providing a nine-month\n\n     period to obtain the mammogram. Pl.’s Ex. 57, at 1061; Def.’s Ex. 2, at 5.\n\n9. The plaintiff received a mammogram at Providence Hospital on February 9, 2011. Trial Tr.\n\n     ECF No. 58 at 43:2–:5. The next day, on February 10, 2011, the radiologist called Dr. Hill-\n\n     Daniel and reported his concerns that the mammogram was highly suspicious for cancer and\n\n     recommended that Dr. Hill-Daniel send the plaintiff for a biopsy. Id. at 43:13–:22. Dr. Hill-\n\n     Daniel telephoned the plaintiff to let her know that she was generating a referral to a surgeon\n\n     so that the plaintiff could get a biopsy. Id. at 111:8–:10. Dr. Hill-Daniel referred the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                                      40\n\f   to Providence surgeon Mark Johnson, M.D. for the biopsy. Pl.’s Ex. 44, at 110:21–111:7;\n\n   Def.’s Ex. 2, at 6. Although Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she could have called the\n\n   Providence Hospital radiology department – where she had admitting privileges – to try to\n\n   get the plaintiff’s appointment moved up, Dr. Hill-Daniel did not contact Dr. Johnson or his\n\n   office to expedite the scheduling of the biopsy. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 116:8–117:4; Pl.’s\n\n   Ex. 44, at 110:21–111:17. Dr. Hill-Daniel generated the referral, and the plaintiff was\n\n   responsible for picking it up from the Unity clinic, calling Dr. Johnson’s office, and\n\n   scheduling the biopsy. Pl.’s Ex. 44, at 108:18–:22.\n\n10. The plaintiff saw Dr. Johnson in his office on March 2, 2011, for a consultation. Pl.’s Ex. 1,\n\n   at 1040; Def.’s Ex. 7. The breast biopsy was performed one week later, on March 8, 2011.\n\n   Pl.’s Ex. 3, at 3001; Def.’s Ex. 8, at 3001. The results of the breast biopsy indicated that the\n\n   mass in the plaintiff’s left breast was invasive ductal carcinoma. Pl.’s Ex. 3, at 3001; Def.’s\n\n   Ex. 8, at 3001.\n\n11. Both parties agree that when the plaintiff was diagnosed with breast cancer on March 8,\n\n   2011, she had advanced stage incurable breast cancer. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 333 (citing Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 55 at 111:7–:9). A PET scan performed on March 28, 2011 and a bone scan\n\n   performed on March 31, 2011 showed that the cancer had metastasized to bones in her right\n\n   shoulder and left scapula. Pl.’s Ex. 8 at 8097, Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 65:12–:16. Dr. Feigert\n\n   testified that the March PET scan showed that the cancer had metastasized to at least eight\n\n   different sites in her bones. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 30:6–:8. Plaintiff does not dispute this.\n\n   3rd FOF Table ¶ 374.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    41\n\f12. The experts dispute whether Dr. Hill-Daniel’s role in the five-month delay between the\n\n   plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 visit and her breast cancer diagnosis violated the applicable\n\n   standard of care.\n\n       a) The plaintiff’s experts, Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Margo, opined that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s\n\n           failure to expedite the diagnostic tests violated the national standard of care for a\n\n           family care doctor. Dr. Sutherland testified that in light of Dr. Hill-Daniel’s findings\n\n           during the plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 visit, the national standard of care required her\n\n           to ensure that the plaintiff got a diagnostic ultrasound within a week, Trial Tr. ECF\n\n           No. 69 at 54:2–:12, and to obtain a diagnosis within two to three weeks of the\n\n           October visit, id. at 54:19–55:5. He testified that it was Dr. Hill-Daniel’s\n\n           responsibility to keep track of the patient and follow-up herself, or ask her staff to\n\n           follow-up, if she did not receive the diagnostic test results within this time period. Id.\n\n           at 56:13–57:7. Dr. Margo opined that Dr. Hill-Daniel ordered the tests in the correct\n\n           order – ultrasound, then mammogram and, finally, biopsy – but that the national\n\n           standard of care required Dr. Hill-Daniel to ensure that the ultrasound was performed\n\n           within two weeks of the October visit, and that the final breast cancer diagnosis was\n\n           made within two to three weeks of the October visit. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 82:4–\n\n           83:5.\n\n       b) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not violate the\n\n           national standard of care by ordering an ultrasound, mammogram, and biopsy in that\n\n           progression. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 41:4–:13, 43:3–:9, 43:18–44:9. In response to\n\n           questions from the Court, however, Dr. Bethea testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s\n\n           detection of lymph node involvement was a “game-changer,” and that, with that\n\n\n\n\n                                                     42\n\f   finding, it was not appropriate to wait six weeks before an ultrasound was performed.\n\n   Id. at 40:24–41:4. He also testified that “if you have an isolated lesion and an axillary\n\n   node, you can skip both [the ultrasound and mammogram] and go straight to biopsy\n\n   and be well in the standard of care.” Id. at 42:5–:8.\n\nc) Notably, while the progression of diagnostic tests may have been satisfactory, Dr.\n\n   Bethea was not so sanguine about the timing of the diagnostic tests in this case. Dr.\n\n   Bethea testified that the timing of the tests did not satisfy “best practices,” which is\n\n   the standard of care that he conforms to as a physician. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at\n\n   45:15–:17 (“If we were speaking best practice, I would not be here defending this\n\n   situation.”). Nonetheless, by drawing a distinction between “best practices” and “the\n\n   national standard of care,” Dr. Bethea testified that the timing of the tests did satisfy\n\n   the standard of care, which he defined as taking into consideration the circumstances\n\n   under which the care is delivered. Id. at 45:4–:10 (“The standard of care, as I said\n\n   earlier, is what a patient has the right to expect under the circumstances in which it’s\n\n   delivered. There are very different sets of circumstances within the medical world,\n\n   and it’s becoming more and more different as time goes on, unfortunately.”); 46:19–\n\n   :23 (“These days, unfortunately, doctors lose control of the situation in big medical\n\n   centers, such as where this occurred. They don’t lose control of it in a practice like\n\n   mine. So it’s two entirely different circumstances.”); 47:5–:11 (“So there are all sorts\n\n   of situations, medical, political, insurance, money. The whole situation is changing\n\n   the approach, in my opinion, much for the worse. This is a good example of that. So\n\n   you can be within the standard of care, as I think this situation was, but be far outside\n\n   the best practice model.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f       d) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Koch, testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel satisfied the national\n\n           standard of care on October 18, 2010, by prescribing a six-week follow-up period for\n\n           the plaintiff to obtain an ultrasound. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 101:25–102:7. He\n\n           testified that the plaintiff’s failure to follow up within that timeframe was her\n\n           responsibility. See id. at 105:17–:22. He also testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel acted\n\n           within the national standard of care by ordering an ultrasound, mammogram, and\n\n           biopsy in that order, id. at 103:19–104:8, and that the physician had no responsibility\n\n           to act to expedite the plaintiff’s appointments for diagnostic tests, id. at 110:22–\n\n           111:20 (“The national standard of care, in its basic tenet, is that if you find something\n\n           and you give the patient an order to get it and give the instructions of the phone\n\n           number and how to get it, then it becomes the patient’s responsibility to follow\n\n           through and get the test done.”). He did concede, however, that “there’s certainly an\n\n           obligation on a physician’s part to impart some need to expedite things.” Id. at\n\n           113:2–:3.\n\n13. After her breast cancer diagnosis, the plaintiff had a series of imaging studies and scans,\n\n   including CT scans of her brain on March 24, 2011 and February 1, 2012, Pl.’s Ex. 15, 25; a\n\n   CT scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis on March 24, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 16; PET/CT scans\n\n   on March 28, 2011, April 3, 2011, and September 17, 2012, Pl.’s Ex. 17, 19, 28; a whole\n\n   body bone scan on March 31, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 18; MRIs of the pelvis on May 12, 2011, and\n\n   July 15, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 21, 23; an MRI of both breasts on April 4, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 20; an MRI\n\n   of the thoracic spine and lumbar spine on May 28, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 22; a CT scan of the thorax\n\n   on July 18, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 24; and a CT scan of her neck on February 1, 2012, Pl.’s Ex. 26.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     44\n\f14. Ms. Rhodes’s cancer treatment began on March 25, 2011, when she began receiving\n\n   hormone therapy with the drug Tamoxifen. Pl.’s Ex. 8, at 8098.\n\n       J.      THE PROGRESSION OF THE PLAINTIFF’S BREAST CANCER\n\n1. The parties agree that the plaintiff has both ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal\n\n   carcinoma. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 339 (citing Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 17:5–:9). The plaintiff’s\n\n   expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that only invasive ductal carcinoma is used for staging because it\n\n   is the only type of breast cancer that invades into adjacent cells and the only part that is\n\n   potentially lethal. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 18:24–:25. The natural tendency of breast cancer\n\n   when it becomes invasive is to migrate to lymph nodes and then to distant metastatic sites.\n\n   Id. at 20:24–21:1.\n\n2. The parties also agree that staging of cancer is important to define the patient’s prognosis and\n\n   treatment options. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 28:20–25. The staging convention used for breast\n\n   cancer in the United States is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (“AJCC”) Staging\n\n   Protocol. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 337 (citing Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:10–:12). Under that\n\n   protocol, there are four stages of breast cancer, with Stage I being the least severe and Stage\n\n   IV being the most severe. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:13–:14. The size and extent of the\n\n   invasive component is what is relevant to staging. Id. at 19:21–:23. If invasive breast cancer\n\n   goes untreated, it will eventually evolve from Stage I to Stage IV. Id. at 20:20–:22. AJCC\n\n   stage is the single most important predictor of outcome. Id. at 21:24–:25.\n\n3. The stage of a patient’s cancer is determined by three characteristics, called the “TNM\n\n   classification.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:15–:18; Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 28:9–:14. T\n\n   stands for the tumor size and extent within the breast; N stands for lymph node involvement;\n\n   and M stands for distant metastases, meaning the spread of the cancer into other areas, such\n\n\n\n\n                                                     45\n\f   as bone, brain, lung, liver, etc. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:17–:22. Stage I denotes a small\n\n   tumor size (T1 to T2), no lymph node involvement (N0), and no metastatic disease (M0). Id.\n\n   at 13:13–:18. Stage II denotes a bigger tumor size (T1, T2, or T3), possible early lymph\n\n   node metastasis, but confined to just a few lymph nodes (N1), and no evidence of metastatic\n\n   disease (M0). Id. at 13:19–:23. Stage III denotes any size tumor (T1, T2, T3, or T4), greater\n\n   nodal involvement, meaning more lymph nodes involved and bulkier lymph nodes, but no\n\n   metastatic disease (M0). Id. at 14:8–:12. When the cancer tumor has invaded the skin, the\n\n   cancer is defined as T4, which is at least Stage III. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 39:4–:5. Finally,\n\n   Stage IV is defined by the presence of metastatic disease (M1). Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   14:13–:16. The experts also agreed that breast cancers have a relatively uniform growth rate.\n\n   Id. at 31:22–:23.\n\n4. Both parties agree that when the plaintiff was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2011,\n\n   she had advanced stage incurable breast cancer. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 333 (citing Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 55 at 11:7–:9). They disagree, however, about how and when her cancer progressed\n\n   through the stages.\n\n       General Progression\n\n5. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, opined that the plaintiff progressed from Stage I cancer by\n\n   first developing lymph node metastases, and then subsequently developing distant\n\n   metastases. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 47:18–:22. That is a representative progression in\n\n   patients with invasive duct carcinoma and it is the progression seen in the great majority of\n\n   patients. Id. at 47:18–:23. According to Dr. Tucker, based upon this progression, the\n\n   plaintiff’s breast cancer was curable in December 2009, and progressed to advanced stage\n\n   incurable cancer before March 2011, id. at 11:6–:9 (Dr. Tucker’s testimony that “it is my\n\n\n\n\n                                                   46\n\f    opinion that the breast cancer was curable in December of 2009, but by the time March 2011\n\n    had arrived, it was advanced stage, which meant that it was incurable at that point in time”).\n\n6. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, testified that by December 2009, the plaintiff already\n\n    had Stage III or, more likely, Stage IV incurable breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at\n\n    30:13–:18.\n\n         Stage of cancer in December 2009\n\n7. Dr. Tucker testified that in his opinion, in December 2009, the plaintiff had Stage I cancer\n\n    with a T value of 1, an N value of 0, and an M value of 0. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 32:5–:20,\n\n    44:15–:18, 45:11–:14.\n\n         a) To discern the T value, Dr. Tucker estimated the size of the plaintiff’s tumor in\n\n             December 2009. Since no imaging studies of the plaintiff’s breasts were done at that\n\n             time, he extrapolated from measurements of her tumor size that were taken in\n\n             December 2010 and March 2011. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 33:18–34:12. The\n\n             December 2010 measurement (1.9 centimeters) was taken from the plaintiff’s\n\n             December 14, 2010 ultrasound, and the March 2011 measurements were taken from\n\n             the March 24, 2011 CT scan (2.8 centimeters) and a March 28, 2011 PET CT scan\n\n             (2.6 centimeters). 9 Id. Dr. Tucker considered each of these tests to be reliable tools\n\n             for measuring tumor size. Id. at 33:18–34:12. Dr. Tucker plotted the size of the\n\n             tumor at the times of the ultrasound, the CT scan, and the PET CT scan on a graph\n\n             with time on one axis and tumor size on the other. Id. at 34:13–:19. Then, because\n\n             cancer has a relatively constant growth rate – a characteristic that both parties\n\n             acknowledge, see 3rd FOF Table ¶ 353 –, he drew a straight line connecting the three\n\n9\n Dr. Tucker explained the .2 centimeter difference between the March 24, 2011 measurement and the March 28,\n2011 measurement as a result of the fact that tumors are not spherical and just a slight rotation of the body can cause\nsmall incremental changes in imaging size. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 34:7–:12.\n\n\n                                                              47\n\f           data points and extending on both ends. According to Dr. Tucker, the point on the\n\n           line that corresponded with December 2009 also corresponded to a tumor size of\n\n           approximately one half to one centimeter. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 34:13–:21.\n\n           Because Dr. Tucker considered the tumor to be fast growing – a characterization\n\n           about which the defendant’s expert disagrees – he opined that the tumor was\n\n           nominally around one centimeter at its greatest dimension in December 2009 and well\n\n           under the two centimeter ceiling for the AJCC T1 category. Id. at 35:1–:6.\n\n       b) Dr. Tucker opined that in December 2009, the plaintiff’s cancer had an N value of 0\n\n           because: (1) he found no evidence of nodal metastatic disease in the records of the\n\n           plaintiff’s December 2009 appointment; and (2) the incidence of lymph node\n\n           metastasis in a patient with a one or two centimeter tumor is low. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n           55 at 44:17–45:10.\n\n       c) Dr. Tucker further opined that in December 2009, the plaintiff cancer had an M value\n\n           of 0 because: (1) if the plaintiff had metastatic disease in December 2009, she likely\n\n           would not be alive today; (2) the plaintiff had a high growth rate cancer; and (3) the\n\n           plaintiff would have developed symptoms of metastases, such as pain, dizziness,\n\n           headaches, seizure, or liver disease, in the fifteen-month period before her December\n\n           2009 appointment and when her cancer was finally diagnosed. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55\n\n           at 45:17–46:20.\n\n8. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, opined that by December 2009, the plaintiff already had\n\n   Stage III or, more likely, Stage IV incurable breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 30:13–\n\n   :18. Dr. Feigert described the following grounds for his opinion: (1) the extent of the cancer\n\n   that was discovered sixteen months later on an MRI; (2) the slow to average growth rate of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    48\n\fthe tumor, as evidenced by the tumor’s average mitotic rate and low Ki-67 value, and (3) the\n\nfavorable genetic profile of the cancer as hormonal receptor positive, HER2 negative. Dr.\n\nFeigert testified that the plaintiff’s April 4, 2011 MRI report showed a tumor over ten\n\ncentimeters in size and “very extensive involvement of the plaintiff’s skin with cancer over a\n\nvery large portion of the breast.” Id. at 31:22–32:5, 34:2–:20, 37:8–:13, 38:9–:10. Dr.\n\nFeigert testified that the radiologist’s report describes “generalized advanced thickening of\n\nthe skin” over the entire breast, which is visible on the MRI image. Id. at 34:12–:20. He\n\nviewed as significant the radiologist’s notations in the report of “evidence of extensive\n\ncarcinoma of the breast is noted with skin invasion” and “immediately direct extension into\n\nthe skin is felt to be present superiorly.” Id. at 35:1:10, 36:23–37:7. Dr. Feigert testified that\n\nsince no imaging of the plaintiff’s breast from December 2009 exists, he had to work\n\nbackward from the imaging that was available. Id. at 37:19–38:6. Due to the extensive\n\nnature of the skin involvement in April 2011, Dr. Feigert opined that it was “exceedingly\n\nlikely that there would have been at least one cancerous cell in the skin” in December 2009.\n\nId. at 38:6–:22. Dr. Feigert also pointed to (1) Dr. Hill-Daniel’s note in the plaintiff’s\n\nprogress note of October 18, 2010, identifying “multiple scars on left breast with some\n\noverlying nodules”; (2) the note on the report from the plaintiff’s December 14, 2010\n\nultrasound, stating “sub centimeter nodules in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast\n\ncorrespond to skin lesions,” as evidence of the extent of skin involvement. Id. at 40:7–41:20.\n\nAccording to Dr. Feigert, since even a single cancer cell in the skin makes the patient a Stage\n\nIII-B, T4, the plaintiff likely had at least Stage III-B cancer in December 2009. Id. at 38:15–\n\n:22 (“[A]ll you need is a single cancer cell in the skin, as of December of ’09 to make this\n\npatient a Stage III-B, the T4, with skin invasion. That’s why I wanted to demonstrate on this\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f   MRI how extensive it was in April of ’11 to make a rational argument that there would have\n\n   certainly been at least a microscopic and in my opinion macroscopic disease in the skin 16\n\n   months earlier.”). Dr. Feigert testified that the misdiagnosis of a Stage III or Stage IV cancer\n\n   as Stage I is “all too common.” Id. at 49:4–50:1 (“[I]n hindsight the explanation for why the\n\n   cancer comes back is there must have been metastases before the surgery.”).\n\n9. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Pushkas, testified that in his opinion, the plaintiff had Stage I\n\n   breast cancer in December 2009. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 67:22–68:2. He testified that T4\n\n   tumors are tumors that extend directly into the skin or chest wall and cause ulcerations and\n\n   nodules on the skin. Id. at 80:13–:14. He also testified that these ulcerations or nodules are\n\n   usually visible or, if not, there may be confounding skin abnormalities. Id. at 80:18–:23. Dr.\n\n   Pushkas testified that there was no indication in Dr. Hill-Daniel’s notes from the plaintiff’s\n\n   December 2009 or October 2010 visits, or in the notes from the plaintiff’s visits to Howard\n\n   University or Fort Washington Medical Center, that would suggest direct extension of the\n\n   cancer into the skin by ulceration or visible nodules on the skin. Id. at 81:3–:13. He further\n\n   testified that he saw no evidence in any of those medical records between December 2009\n\n   and the end of 2010 that would suggest T4 cancer. Id. at 81:14–82:9.\n\n       Progression of cancer after December 2009\n\n10. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that, in his opinion, the cancer progressed from\n\n   Stage I to Stage II, meaning the plaintiff developed lymph node metastases, sometime\n\n   between July and November 2010. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 47:24–48:11. Dr. Tucker also\n\n   testified that the cancer progressed to Stage IV sometime between December 2010 and\n\n   February 2011. Dr. Tucker relied on the extent of the distant metastasis shown on the March\n\n   24, 2011, PET CT scan and a subsequent technetium 99 scan. Id. at 49:20–50:5. According\n\n\n\n\n                                                     50\n\f   to Dr. Tucker, the metastatic disease was distributed among bony sites, but the sites were few\n\n   in number and there was no evidence of visceral involvement (brain, lungs, liver, or other\n\n   body sites). Id. at 50:10–:15. Metastases take time to develop, but how long this takes is a\n\n   function of the cancer’s growth rate. Id. at 50:16–23. Based on his opinion that the\n\n   plaintiff’s cancer has a high growth rate and the extent of the metastases in March 2011, Dr.\n\n   Tucker calculated that the plaintiff’s cancer would have metastasized distantly between July\n\n   and November 2010. Id. at 48:1–:3.\n\n11. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Pushkas, opined that the plaintiff’s disease probably became Stage\n\n   II disease during the summer of 2010, probably in July or August. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at\n\n   74:23–:24. The grounds for his opinion were that no lymph nodes were felt in December of\n\n   2009, but they were easily palpable ten months later, in October 2010, and showed on the\n\n   later imaging studies, and that lymph node involvement is dependent on the size of the\n\n   primary tumor. Id. 74:20–75:16.\n\n12. Dr. Bowers, the diagnostic radiologist who interpreted the plaintiff’s pelvis MRIs from May\n\n   12, 2011 and July 15, 2011, and who wrote the corresponding reports, testified that the May\n\n   12, 2011, MRI showed three early metastatic lesions. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 53:16–:25.\n\n   These pelvis lesions were not present on the March 2011 CT scan nor was abnormal activity\n\n   in those areas reflected on the bone scan conducted on March 31, 2011. Id. at 54:5–:15.\n\n   Accordingly, he testified that he considered the metastatic lesions to be new as of May 2011.\n\n   Id. at 54:16–:18. On the report, he wrote that his impression was “several lesions . . . that are\n\n   suspicious for early bony metastatic disease.” Pl.’s Ex. 21.\n\n13. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, agreed with the plaintiff’s experts that by March 31,\n\n   2011, the plaintiff’s cancer had metastasized into the bone, Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 65:4–:6,\n\n\n\n\n                                                    51\n\f   65:12–:16, based on his opinion that her cancer was already at a Stage III-B or IV by\n\n   December 2009, id. at 67:18–68:12.\n\n       The growth rate of the plaintiff’s cancer\n\n14. Both parties agree that the growth rate of a cancer will contribute to stage progression. Trial\n\n   Tr. ECF No. 55 at 24:6–:7. The parties’ experts disagreed, however, about the growth rate of\n\n   the plaintiff’s cancer. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that the plaintiff’s cancer is\n\n   fast growing, id. at 46:9–:10, whereas the defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, testified that it has\n\n   an average to slow growth rate, Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 93:3–:6.\n\n15. Dr. Tucker and Dr. Feigert agreed that breast cancer’s histopathological grade provides\n\n   useful prognostic information that helps with treatment decisions. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   22:2; Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 46:23–:25, 48:4–:6. The grading of breast cancer is correlated\n\n   to the aggressiveness of the cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 46:23–:25, 48:4–:6. The grading\n\n   system endorsed by the AJCC is the Scarff Bloom Richardson System (also referred to as the\n\n   Nottingham grading scheme), which has three grades. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 22:8–:13,\n\n   71:23–72:1. The grade of the cancer is determined by measuring three characteristics of the\n\n   cancer cells under a microscope: the tubules, the atypia, and the mitotic rate. Id. at 24:11–\n\n   25:5. The tubule component describes how well the cancer makes small ducts that give the\n\n   tumor its origin. Id. at 24:12–:14. The atypia component describes how typical the nucleus\n\n   of the cancer cell is. Id. at 24:14–:19. The mitotic rate component describes the number of\n\n   cells in the process of dividing. Id. at 24:19–:22. Each of these components is scored on a\n\n   scale of one to three, and the sum of the scores determines the grade. Id. at 24:22–25:5. A\n\n   total score of three, four, or five equals a grade one; a total score of six or seven equals a\n\n\n\n\n                                                     52\n\f   grade two; and a total score of eight or nine equals a grade three. Id. at 25:6–:13. The higher\n\n   the grade, the more aggressive the tumor. Id. at 24:6–:9; Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 46:23–:25.\n\n16. The treating pathologists at Providence Hospital graded the plaintiff’s tumor as a grade three,\n\n   or the most aggressive type of tumor. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 78:19–:23. This grade was\n\n   calculated from a tubule score of 3, an atypia score of 3 and a mitotic rate score of 2. Def.’s\n\n   Ex. 8, at 3001; Pl.’s Ex. 3, at 3001.\n\n17. The experts disagreed about the importance of the grade for describing the cancer’s growth\n\n   rate, the independent significance of each of the individual component scores, and the\n\n   importance of certain other indicators for predicting the growth rate of the cancer.\n\n       a) The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that the grade is the second most\n\n           important predictor of outcome with breast cancer and that the higher the grade of the\n\n           cancer, the faster the growth. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 22:2, 23:24–24:5. According\n\n           to Dr. Tucker, because the plaintiff’s cancer is grade three, the plaintiff’s breast\n\n           cancer has a high growth rate. Id. at 32:2–:3. Dr. Tucker also testified that all three\n\n           characteristics (tubules, atypia, and mitotic rate) are necessary to determine the\n\n           growth rate of the cancer and no individual component of the grade is a significant\n\n           predictor of the cancer’s growth rate on its own. Id. at 25:14–:25. Dr. Tucker\n\n           testified that the level of Ki-67 – a “proliferation marker” that measures expression of\n\n           synthesizing DNA – cannot be used to predict tumor growth rate. Id. at 63:12–:22\n\n           (use of Ki-67 to measure the growth rate of a tumor is a “misuse of the marker.”).\n\n       b) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, testified that the grade of the cancer is a measure\n\n           of its aggressiveness, which is distinct from growth rate. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at\n\n           92:18–:21 (“[W]e often see aggression correlating with growth rate, but not always.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     53\n\f            Aggression could be a slow growing cancer that is invading into the tissues. So as\n\n            medical oncologists we distinguish the two.”). According to Dr. Feigert, while the\n\n            plaintiff’s cancer is aggressive, it is not particularly fast growing. Id. at 46:22–48:8,\n\n            52:20–:22, 53:10–:12. Dr. Feigert also testified that the part of the grading system\n\n            that indicates the cancer’s growth rate is the mitotic rate because it reflects how fast\n\n            the cells are dividing. Id. at 46:22–47:14. The plaintiff’s mitotic rate was determined\n\n            by the physicians at Providence Hospital to be a two out of three. Id. at 79:11–:12.\n\n            According to Dr. Feigert, that level indicates that while the plaintiff’s tumor is\n\n            aggressive, its growth rate is average. Id. at 79:11–:13. Dr. Feigert also testified that\n\n            the level of Ki-67 is a predictor of tumor growth rate and that the plaintiff’s Ki-67\n\n            value indicates a slow-growing cancer. Id. at 75:15–:19, 77:14–:19, 79:11–:12. Dr.\n\n            Feigert acknowledged, however, that the Ki-67 level was developed to predict the\n\n            responsiveness of a cancer to particular treatment options. Id. at 76:4–:10. He further\n\n            acknowledged that the AJCC has rejected the incorporation of proliferation markers\n\n            such as Ki-67 into its staging system, and that the Ki-67 level does not seem to\n\n            reliably predict prognosis. Id. at 76:11–77:4. Dr. Feigert attempted to bolster his\n\n            description of the plaintiff’s cancer by noting that the genetic profile of her cancer,\n\n            Luminal A, suggests a relatively slow growth rate. Id. at 63:18–:24.\n\n       K.      Breast cancer prognoses\n\n1. The parties agree on the basic probabilities of survival at the various stages of breast cancer.\n\n   Dr. Pushkas testified that the SEER Survival Monograph on Breast Cancer (“SEER\n\n   database”) is a reliable and authoritative source for determining the probability of survival\n\n   from breast cancer in its various stages, Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 63:5–:19, which the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      54\n\f   defendant does not dispute, 3rd FOF Table ¶ 390. The SEER database represents a\n\n   compilation of data from over 300,000 cases reported from all over the United States. Trial\n\n   Tr. ECF No. 56 at 62:17–:21, 63:13–:19. According to the SEER Survival Monograph, the\n\n   average overall survival for Stage I breast cancer is ninety-eight percent, id. at 77:14–:16; the\n\n   average ten-year survival for Stage II breast cancer is in the low- to mid-seventy percent\n\n   range, id. at 78:7–:13, and the five-year survival for Stage IV breast cancer is fiteen percent,\n\n   id. at 83:5–84:1.\n\n2. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Pushkas, testified that in his opinion, given what he knows about\n\n   the plaintiff and the nature of her cancer, the plaintiff would have had a ninety-eight percent\n\n   survival rate when her cancer was Stage I, Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 77:22–78:6, and a seventy\n\n   percent ten-year survival when her cancer was Stage II, id. at 78:14–:23. If the plaintiff’s\n\n   breast cancer had been diagnosed at Stage I or Stage II, there is a substantial probability that\n\n   her cancer would have been cured. Id. at 79:5–:13.\n\n3. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that the cure rate for Stage I breast cancer is\n\n   eighty to eighty-five percent over five years, and for Stage II breast cancer is over fifty\n\n   percent, Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 49:11–:13. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, testified that\n\n   the chance of survival for a patient with Stage III-B or Stage IV breast cancer is less than\n\n   fifty percent. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 61:24–:25.\n\n       L.      The plaintiff’s medical treatment\n\n1. Dr. Yoo, the plaintiff’s oncologist since January 30, 2012, Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 20:20–:21,\n\n   testified that since her diagnosis, the plaintiff has undergone hormone treatment,\n\n   chemotherapy, mastectomy, and radiation therapy, and has been medically induced into\n\n   menopause. Pl.’s Ex. 8, at 8113–14. Her treatment began with hormone therapy, using a\n\n\n\n\n                                                      55\n\f   drug called Tamoxifen, from March 25, 2011 to April 12, 2011, followed by neoadjuvant\n\n   chemotherapy until July 2011. Pl.’s Ex. 8 at 8098. A CAT scan taken at that time showed\n\n   that the mass in the plaintiff’s breast mass had significantly decreased with the\n\n   chemotherapy. Id. The plaintiff underwent a mastectomy of her left breast at Providence\n\n   Hospital on September 13, 2011. Id. The plaintiff’s treatments have been modified\n\n   numerous times since then based on the changing nature of her reactions and the cancer’s\n\n   reactions to them. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 27:24–34:9. Since the plaintiff’s cancer is\n\n   incurable, her treatment has been palliative and directed to pain management. Id. at 28:20–\n\n   :25, 34:13–:20. At some time in the future, no more treatments will be available to the\n\n   plaintiff. Id. at 34:10–:16.\n\n2. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Pushkas, opined that if the plaintiff’s breast cancer had been\n\n   diagnosed sometime between December 2009 and mid-February 2010, her course of\n\n   treatment would have been different. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 71:22–72:12. In his opinion,\n\n   an imaging study would have showed an abnormal finding. Id. at 72:5. The physician then\n\n   would have ordered a biopsy for tissue confirmation. Id. at 72:5–:9. Once the biopsy\n\n   revealed cancer, she would have been evaluated for the metastatic disease spread elsewhere\n\n   in the body, which in Dr. Pushkas’s opinion would not have been found. Id. at 72:10–:13.\n\n   Next, the plaintiff would have undergone a mastectomy to remove the breast and the lymph\n\n   nodes in the armpit. Id. at 72:12–:20. In light of his opinion that the cancer would not have\n\n   spread to the lymph nodes by that time, the plaintiff would have been treated either with\n\n   hormone treatment alone – because her cancer has been shown to be hormone dependent for\n\n   its growth – or chemotherapy. Id. at 72:21–73:12. Due to the plaintiff’s young age at the\n\n   time, Dr. Pushkas would have recommended a twenty-four week course of chemotherapy\n\n\n\n\n                                                    56\n\f   instead of hormone treatment. Id. at 73:2–12. He opined that this course of treatment would\n\n   have cured the plaintiff of cancer, with only repeated examinations as the necessary follow-\n\n   up. Id. at 73:11–:12.\n\n3. Dr. Pushkas also testified that if the plaintiff’s breast cancer had been diagnosed at or around\n\n   when she was Stage II, the treatment protocol would have been largely the same as the\n\n   treatment he recommended at Stage I. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 76:4–:10. The only\n\n   difference, in his opinion, is that if the plaintiff had ten or more involved lymph nodes in the\n\n   armpit, a radiotherapist would have recommended radiation treatment after the mastectomy.\n\n   Id. at 76:9–:15.

The Plaintiff’s Economic Damages\n\n1. Through expert witnesses, both parties presented an estimate of the economic damages the\n\n   plaintiff incurred as a result of the delayed diagnosis of her breast cancer. Pl.’s Exs. 31, 53,\n\n   54; Def.’s Exs. 36, 37. Both parties’ economic expert witnesses analyzed the economic\n\n   losses the plaintiff would be expected to incur from loss of wages, loss of household services,\n\n   and the cost of future care. See id.\n\n       a) The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Lurito, assumed the plaintiff would work until retirement at\n\n            age sixty-five, based on the information he had been given regarding the plaintiff’s\n\n            intentions. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 13:13–:16. He conservatively assumed that the\n\n            plaintiff’s wages would be static, increasing only to keep pace with inflation,\n\n            throughout that entire period. Id. at 14:9–:14. Dr. Lurito applied a 3.5 percent after-\n\n            tax discount rate to his estimates of the plaintiff’s lost future wages. Id. at 17:19–:21.\n\n            The discount rate Dr. Lurito used took into account the amount of interest the plaintiff\n\n            could earn on the lump sum of wages provided so as not to overcompensate the\n\n            plaintiff. Id. at 16:16–22; 17:5–:7. Dr. Lurito did not deduct any personal\n\n            maintenance or consumption costs from his estimate because the plaintiff is still alive.\n\n            Id. at 19:18–:24. Based on these calculations, Dr. Lurito opined the plaintiff’s lost\n\n            wages amount to $737,715. Id. at 15:21–:23.\n\n       b) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, agreed with one of the plaintiff’s expert’s\n\n            assumptions, namely, that the plaintiff’s wages would remain static, adjusted for\n\n            inflation, over her lifetime. Def.’s Ex. 36 at 15:3–8. She differed in three other\n\n            assumptions, however. First, Dr. Hurdle assumed a shorter length of the plaintiff’s\n\n            work life expectancy and estimated this period to be twenty-seven more years, in\n\n\n\n\n                                                      59\n\f             reliance on statistical work life tables that measure the average working life of a\n\n             woman with the plaintiff’s age and education background. Def.’s Ex. 36, at 29:2–:3.\n\n             Second, Dr. Hurdle differed from the plaintiff’s expert in the after-tax discount rate,\n\n             for which Dr. Hurdle used 8.98 percent. Id. at 21:15–16. That rate, according to Dr.\n\n             Hurdle, took into account the “riskiness of the future earnings that the plaintiff would\n\n             have but-for this injury.” Id. at 18:16–:19. She based this discount rate on the rate\n\n             for which one could obtain a two-year, unsecured loan or the rate a credit card\n\n             company would charge. See id. at 20:5–:24. Finally, unlike the plaintiff’s economic\n\n             expert, Dr. Hurdle deducted consumption, or the percent of the plaintiff’s income she\n\n             would be expected to spend on herself, from the amount of future wages she\n\n             estimated. Id. at 15:9–:14. Based on these calculations, Dr. Hurdle determined the\n\n             plaintiff’s lost wages amount to between $116,176 and $139,740. Id. at 23:5–:9.\n\n2. Both experts agreed that the plaintiff’s economic damages would include the loss of\n\n     household services, which refers to the services the plaintiff would have been able to provide\n\n     to her children had the injury not occurred. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 20:5–:13; Def.’s Ex. 36\n\n     at 25:20–:25, 26:1–:2. The plaintiff’s expert calculated this loss by determining the cost of a\n\n     live-in nanny for the plaintiff’s two children until the youngest child turned eighteen or\n\n     twenty-one and subtracted the value of the services the plaintiff will be able to provide for\n\n     approximately the next two years. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 20:25, 21:1–:4; 21:22–:25. Using\n\n     this methodology, Dr. Lurito opined the plaintiff would suffer economic losses of between\n\n     $508,122 and $652,939. 10 Dr. Lurito applied a 3.5 percent discount rate to his calculations.\n\n\n10\n   The lower end of the range is the number calculated until the plaintiff’s youngest child reaches age eighteen while\nthe higher end of the range is calculated until the plaintiff’s youngest child reaches age twenty-one. Tr. ECF No. 71\nat 21:7–:18.\n\n\n\n                                                              60\n\f     Id. at 23:4–:7. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, calculated loss of household services in\n\n     two ways: the wages for a live-in nanny and the statistical value of the plaintiff’s time\n\n     according to economic statistics tables. Def.’s Ex. 36 at 23:18–:25; 24:17–:24. The\n\n     defendant calculated the value of the plaintiff’s household services based on the plaintiff’s\n\n     youngest child needing services until age eighteen or twenty-one. Id. at 23:23–:24. Dr.\n\n     Hurdle applied an 8.98 percent discount rate to these calculations, assuming the need to\n\n     compensate for the risk that the plaintiff may not have been able to perform these services\n\n     even without the injury and whether the plaintiff’s “children would need that care.” Id. at\n\n     24:8–:12. Using the live-in nanny method of calculation, Dr. Hurdle opined the plaintiff\n\n     stood to lose $367,062. Id. at 27:15. Using the statistical table method, Dr. Hurdle opined\n\n     the plaintiff would suffer between $166,521 and $191,239 in losses. Id. at 27:6–:7.\n\n3. To determine the cost of the plaintiff’s future medical care, both economists relied upon the\n\n     report submitted by Nurse Patterson, the plaintiff’s expert. 11 Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 24:5–\n\n     :9; Def.’s Ex. 36 at 30:11–:17. Nurse Patterson stated the plaintiff would require\n\n     approximately 1.5 years of future care, see Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:13–:17, and in her\n\n     report, Nurse Patterson identified four areas of future care costs: psychological counseling,\n\n     hospice care, medical care, and nursing services. Pl.’s Ex. 53. Dr. Lurito, the plaintiff’s\n\n     expert, estimated the future medical care costs the plaintiff is likely to incur are between\n\n     $146,682 and $149,886 based on the potential escalation of costs over the next 1.5 years and\n\n     applying a 3.5 percent discount rate. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 25:21–:25; 26:1; 26:6–11. The\n\n     defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, adjusted Nurse Patterson’s estimates to provide a range of\n\n     estimated costs for obtaining counseling and in-home nursing services, with a low range\n\n\n11\n Nurse Patterson’s calculations include the recommendations of the plaintiff’s social worker, Mila Tecala. Tr. ECF\nNo. 56 at 94:20–:22.\n\n\n                                                            61\n\f   determined by using District of Columbia wage rates, and, for the upper range, using the\n\n   actual costs to a client for such counseling. Def.’s Ex. 36 at 31:3–:11; 35:2–:23. For in-\n\n   patient hospice care, Dr. Hurdle opined the plaintiff could move into a nursing home and use\n\n   out-patient hospice care (being brought into the nursing home) instead of moving into a\n\n   hospice. Id. at 36:5–:20. Overall, Dr. Hurdle estimated the lower bound for future care\n\n   costs, including in-patient hospice care, to be $90,434 and the upper bound to be $111,889.\n\n   Id. at 37:12–:13.\n\n       N.     The Plaintiff’s Non-Economic Damages\n\n1. The plaintiff is seeking non-economic damages in the amount of $6 million in addition to\n\n   economic damages. Compl. at 8, ECF No. 1. To describe the plaintiff’s non-economic\n\n   damages for pain and suffering, the plaintiff provided, in addition to her own testimony, the\n\n   testimony of her treating oncologist and the licensed social worker who evaluated her mental\n\n   health.\n\n2. The plaintiff’s oncologist, Dr. Yoo, testified the plaintiff was “very saddened” when he\n\n   informed her that her cancer was incurable. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 23:16. With respect to\n\n   her physical condition, he testified the plaintiff was complaining continuously of bone pain\n\n   as of February 14, 2012. Trial Id. at 24:7–:8. As Dr. Yoo continued to treat the plaintiff, he\n\n   testified, she complained of worsening bone pain, particularly in the “low back, hip and\n\n   multiple joints.” Id. at 28:4–:10. At times, the plaintiff was taking narcotic pain relievers to\n\n   alleviate her bone pain. Id. at 33:17–:18. Dr. Yoo testified that he didn’t “recollect there was\n\n   a significant pain free, truly pain-free period” between the time he began treating her in\n\n   January 2012 and the time of trial. Id. at 33:25–34:5. The treatments rendered the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                                    62\n\f   temporarily post-menopausal, id. at 30:6–:10, and caused her to be bloated and gain weight.\n\n   Id. at 31:22–:23.\n\n3. Ms. Tecala, who evaluated the plaintiff’s mental health in 2012 and again in 2013, Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 70 at 94:13–16, testified that the plaintiff was diagnosed with depression in 2012.\n\n   Id. at 95:23. Ms. Tecala testified the plaintiff told her “she only could sleep maybe four or\n\n   five hours a night” and “stays in bed or stays on the couch and watches TV because she [is]\n\n   too tired or too much in pain to do anything” other than take her children to school and pick\n\n   them up from school. Id. at 97:2–:9. Ms. Tecala noted the plaintiff “had the saddest\n\n   demeanor” and “spoke almost in a whisper, as if talking took so much effort.” Id. at 97:13–\n\n   :16. In testifying about the difference in evaluations between 2012 and 2013, Ms. Tecala\n\n   opined that the plaintiff was more depressed in 2013, id. at 99:18–:21, and Ms. Tecala\n\n   testified the plaintiff is suffering from the loss of health, body parts, and “body experiences\n\n   like pain and suffering.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 9:18–:23. She also testified the plaintiff is\n\n   experiencing anticipatory grieving for her impending death. Id. at 10:5–:15. The plaintiff,\n\n   Ms. Tecala testified, is “very concerned about her children . . . and what would happen to\n\n   them when she dies.” Id. at 12:12–:15. The plaintiff does not “have the energy or the\n\n   wherewithal to [play with her children] because she is in pain.” Id. at 14:7–:8.\n\n4. The plaintiff testified that she had to quit her job because of “the pains that I had been having\n\n   in my body, which was, I couldn’t stand for a long period of time.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   103:14–:16. She testified she is unable to pursue her goal of exploring the world because of\n\n   her doctor appointments. Id. at 104:24–105:6. In addition, the chemotherapy has reduced\n\n   the plaintiff’s strength and energy levels. Id. at 105:12–:18. She has lost all of her hair. Id.\n\n   at 105:22. The plaintiff testified she no longer wants to be around people and spends most of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    63\n\f       her days in bed. Id. at 106:1–:7. She feels guilty she will not “be here for long for my kids\n\n       to give them the things that they need.” Id. at 107:6–:9.\n\nIII.      CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n          In reaching the conclusions of law, the Court evaluates the evidence to determine whether\n\nthe plaintiff has established each element of the negligence claim against the defendant by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. See District of Columbia v. Price, 759 A.2d 181, 183 (D.C.\n\n2000) (“In order to show negligence, a plaintiff must establish, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, the applicable standard of care, a breach of that standard by the defendant, and a causal\n\nrelationship between the breach and the plaintiff’s injury.”) (citing District of Columbia v.\n\nWilson, 721 A.2d 591, 597 (D.C. 1998)); Clark v. Feder Semo & Bard, P.C., 895 F. Supp. 2d 7,\n\n29 (D.D.C. 2012) (D.D.C. Aug. 15, 2012) (“The Court reviews the evidence under the ‘default\n\nrule for civil cases,’ the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ standard.”) (citing CIGNA Corp. v.\n\nAmara, 131 S. Ct. 1866, 1881 (2011)); see also Ascom Hasler Mailing Systems, Inc. v. United\n\nStates Postal Service, 885 F. Supp. 2d 156, 181 (D.D.C. 2012). 12 The Court first reviews the\n\napplicable legal standards for negligence claims for medical malpractice under the FTCA, and\n\nthen assesses whether the plaintiff has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, each of the\n\nelements for her negligence claim against the defendant.\n\n          A.      THE APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n                  1.       The Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n           The United States, as a sovereign, is absolutely immune from suit and, unless Congress\n\nhas unequivocally consented to permit a cause of action, no court has jurisdiction to entertain a\n\nclaim against the United States. United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586-87 (1941); United\n\n12\n  The defendant would bear the same burden of proof to establish any affirmative defense of contributory\nnegligence, but, in this case, as discussed above, the Court precluded the defendant from belatedly asserting this\ndefense. See Minute Order (June 18, 2013).\n\n\n                                                              64\n\fStates v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399 (1976). Congress created a limited waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity of the United States by enacting the FTCA, the provisions of which must be strictly\n\nconstrued in favor of the United States. See Dep’t of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 261\n\n(1999); United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980); United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S.\n\n111, 117-18 (1979); Tri-State Hosp. Supply Corp. v. United States, 341 F.3d 571, 575 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n         The FTCA creates liability for certain torts committed by agencies of the United States or\n\ntheir employees “in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like\n\ncircumstances . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 2674; see also Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214,\n\n217-18 (2008) (“In the FTCA, Congress waived the United States’ sovereign immunity for\n\nclaims arising out of torts committed by federal employees.”). The Supreme Court has explained\n\nthat “the effect of the Tort Claims Act is to waive immunity from recognized causes of action,\n\nnot to visit the Government with novel and unprecedented liabilities.” United States v. Brown,\n\n348 U.S. 110, 112-13 (1954) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, the\n\nliability of the United States for the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its employees,\n\nacting within the scope of their employment, is determined “in accordance with the law of the\n\nplace where the act or omission occurred.” 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1). The Supreme Court has\n\n“consistently held that § 1346(b)’s reference to the ‘law of the place’ means law of the State –\n\nthe source of substantive liability under the FTCA.” FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 478 (1994)\n\n(collecting cases); Molzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 305 (1992) (in medical malpractice\n\ncases “the extent of the United States’ liability under the FTCA is generally determined by\n\nreference to state law”). Hence, the FTCA incorporates state law, including the elements of an\n\nalleged tort as defined by state tort law. Tri-State Hosp. Supply Corp., 341 F.3d at 576. Since\n\n\n\n\n                                                    65\n\fthe alleged acts and omissions giving rise to the plaintiff’s negligence claim against the\n\ngovernment occurred in the District of Columbia, the parties do not dispute that the law of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia applies. See Pl.’s Corrected Proposed Concls. of Law (“Pl.’s Concls.”) at 2;\n\nDef.’s Proposed Concls. of Law (“Def.’s Concls.”) at 2. Thus, the liability of the United States\n\nis measured against the standards for medical malpractice in the District of Columbia.\n\n               2.      Negligence Standard for Medical Malpractice\n\n       Under District of Columbia law, the plaintiff in a medical malpractice action must\n\ndemonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence three elements: (1) the applicable standard of\n\ncare; (2) the fact that the defendant, through his or her actions or inactions, deviated from that\n\nstandard of care; (3) and that a causal relationship exists between the defendant’s deviation and\n\nthe plaintiff’s injuries. Flores-Hernandez v. United States, 910 F. Supp. 2d 64, 72, *17-18\n\n(D.D.C. Dec. 18, 2012) (enumerating tripartite burden in medical malpractice actions) (citing\n\nWashington v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 579 A.2d 177, 181 (D.C. 1990)); Ornoff v. Kuhn & Kogan,\n\nChartered, 549 A.2d 728, 731 (D.C. 1998); Psychiatric Inst. of Wash. v. Allen, 509 A. 2d 619,\n\n623-24 (D.C. 1986)); see also Burton v. United States, 668 F. Supp. 2d 86, 98 (D.D.C. 2009);\n\nAppleton v. United States, 180 F. Supp. 2d 177, 182 (D.D.C. 2002) (in FTCA negligence suit, the\n\nplaintiff “bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, to demonstrate the\n\napplicable standard of care, deviation from that standard, and the causal relationship between the\n\ndeviation and plaintiff’s injury”) (citing Messina v. District of Columbia, 663 A.2d 535, 537-38\n\n(D.C. 1995)); Giordano v. Sherwood, 968 A.2d 494, 498 (D.C. 2009); Nwaneri v. Sandidge, 931\n\nA.2d 466, 470 (D.C. 2007).\n\n       Each of these elements usually must be proven by expert testimony. Porter v. McHugh,\n\n850 F. Supp. 2d 264, 267 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing Cleary v. Group Health Ass’n, 691 A.2d 148,\n\n\n\n\n                                                     66\n\f153 (D.C. 1997) (“Generally, in a medical malpractice negligence action, the plaintiff must\n\npresent medical expert testimony to establish the standard of care, expert testimony that the\n\ndefendant’s conduct deviated from that standard of care, and expert testimony establishing that\n\nthe alleged deviation proximately caused the plaintiff’s injuries”)); see also Woldeamanuel v.\n\nGeorgetown Univ. Hosp., 703 A.2d 1243, 1245 (D.C. 1997). “While absolute certainty is not\n\nrequired, opinion evidence that is conjectural or speculative is not permitted.” Sponaugle v. Pre-\n\nTerm, Inc., 411 A.2d 366, 367 (D.C. 1980). Indeed, the requirement of expert testimony is\n\ndesigned to mitigate the risk that findings might be “based on mere conjecture or speculation[,]”\n\nor incorrect assumptions. Giordano, 968 A.2d at 498. Where the experts disagree, the task of\n\nthe finder of fact is to evaluate the sufficiency of the foundation for each proffered opinion, as\n\nmeasured against the factual evidence and the applicable medical or scientific principle. See id.;\n\nNwaneri, 931 A.2d at 470; Washington, 579 A.2d at 181; Haidak v. Corso, 841 A.2d 316, 327\n\n(D.C. 2004) (“Expert testimony may be excluded when the expert is unable to show a reliable\n\nbasis for [his] theory.”). As discussed below, the plaintiff has carried her burden on each of\n\nthese elements.\n\n       B.      THE DEFENDANT WAS NEGLIGENT IN FAILING TIMELY TO\n               DIAGNOSE THE PLAINTIFF’S BREAST CANCER.\n\n       The parties agree that the applicable standard of care is a national standard, “not just a\n\nlocal custom.” Nwaneri, 931 A.2d at 470 (quoting Travers v. District of Columbia, 672 A.2d\n\n566, 568 (D.C. 1996)); Flores-Hernandez, 910 F. Supp. 2d at 72. Generally, the applicable\n\nstandard of care for all health care professionals and facilities is the “course of action that a\n\nreasonably prudent doctor with the defendant’s specialty would have taken under the same or\n\nsimilar circumstances.” Strickland v. Pinder, 899 A.2d 770, 773 (D.C. 2006) (quoting Meek v.\n\nShepard, 484 A.2d 579, 581 (D.C. 1984)); Morrison v. MacNamara, 407 A.2d 555, 561 (D.C.\n\n\n\n                                                      67\n\f1979) (stating that the standard is “that degree of reasonable care and skill expected of members\n\nof the medical profession under the same or similar circumstances”). Since Dr. Hill-Daniel is a\n\nfamily practice doctor, the parties agree that the applicable standard is the national standard of\n\ncare for a reasonably prudent family practice doctor. The plaintiff alleges that Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nbreached that standard at multiple points during her treatment of the plaintiff. The Court agrees,\n\nand addresses each alleged breach below.\n\n               1.      December 2009–April 2010\n\n       Based on the factual circumstances in this case and the testimony of the expert witnesses,\n\nthe Court finds that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s conclusions and the corresponding treatment plan that she\n\nprescribed during the plaintiff’s December 3, 2009 visit were not within the national standard of\n\ncare for a family practice doctor.\n\n       Both of the plaintiff’s experts testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel first breached the national\n\nstandard of care by failing to consider breast cancer as part of her “differential diagnosis,” which\n\nis the list of possible diagnoses for a particular set of symptoms. Dr. Sutherland testified that\n\nbreast cancer “absolutely” had to be included on the differential diagnosis of the plaintiff’s breast\n\ncomplaints at the December 9, 2009 visit. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 39:25–40:8. Dr. Margo\n\nexpressed the same opinion. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70. at 64:6–:8. Notably, Dr. Margo’s opinion\n\nwas premised entirely on the words written on the progress note for the plaintiff’s December 3,\n\n2009, visit: that the plaintiff came in because of “pain and tenderness in her breasts,” that she\n\ncomplained of “tenderness and lumpiness,” that there was no change in this pain or lumpiness\n\nwith her menstrual cycle, and that upon examination, Dr. Hill-Daniel found no masses, no\n\nretractions, and no visible lymph nodes. See id. at 54:12–58:22. Dr. Margo emphasized the\n\nsignificance of the notation that the symptoms did not change with the plaintiff’s menstrual\n\n\n\n\n                                                     68\n\fcycle. According to Dr. Margo, women tend to get cysts in their breasts that go away after their\n\nperiod, so the fact that the plaintiff’s lumpiness did not change with her menstrual cycle made\n\nthat diagnosis less likely. Id. at 55:20–:23. Dr. Sutherland also focused primarily on the\n\nundisputedly non-cyclic nature of the plaintiff’s complaints. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 39:20–24\n\n(“So the differential diagnosis in noncyclical breast pain would include potentially chest wall\n\ntenderness, breast cancer. But the differential diagnosis had to be developed that would consider\n\nall the different possibilities.”).\n\n        Relying primarily on the plaintiff’s young age and on what they perceived as the bilateral\n\nnature of her complaints, i.e., meaning that they pertained to both breasts, defendant’s experts\n\nDr. Bethea and Dr. Koch testified that the national standard of care did not require Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel to consider breast cancer as part of her differential diagnosis. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at\n\n32:8–:12 (Dr. Bethea’s testimony that for a “[t]wenty-four year-old with bilateral benign\n\nfibrocystic findings, it would be inappropriate to list cancer as a very real concern simply\n\nbecause it would not be a very real concern. It would be a very rare occurrence.”); id. at 89:8–\n\n:15 (Dr. Koch’s testimony that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s assessment was “perfectly reasonable” for a\n\n“twenty-four-year-old woman complaining of bilateral breast pain and lumpiness in her\n\nbreasts.”).\n\n        The Court finds, in addition, that the plaintiff’s experts succeeded in showing that young\n\nage is not a credible reason for declining to list breast cancer on a differential diagnosis for a\n\nwoman presenting with the plaintiff’s complaints of feeling a “knot” in her breast and\n\nnoncyclical pain, in the context of a medical history of both grandmothers’ having breast cancer.\n\nDr. Sutherland testified that “many breast cancers that are diagnosed in this country today come\n\nfrom the findings of the patient’s own self breast examination, and that’s particularly true in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      69\n\fyounger individuals when routine screening isn’t necessarily done.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at\n\n38:7–:12. Dr. Margo added that “young women often aren’t that sensitized to their body, so a\n\nyoung woman coming in complaining of breast lumps, which is not a common complaint of\n\nyoung women, I would pay more attention to it.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 78:25–79:4.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Margo testified that even though the incidence of breast cancer is rare in women\n\nof the plaintiff’s age, “young women tend to have very aggressive breast cancers,” so it is\n\nparticularly important to diagnose a young woman’s breast cancer early. Id. at 78:19–:22. In her\n\nexpert opinion, breast cancer had to be on the differential diagnosis because “it was the most\n\ndangerous thing to miss.” Id. at 64:6–:8; see also id. 65:16–:18 (Dr, Margo’s testimony that “if\n\nit’s something that would be really terrible if you missed it, then you need to make sure you’re\n\nright” that the cause of the concerns is not that thing).\n\n       The defendants’ experts’ reliance on the bilateral nature of the plaintiff’s complaints also\n\ndiminishes the credibility of their opinions. See Haidak v. Corso, 841 A.2d 316, 327 (D.C.\n\n2004) (“Expert testimony may be excluded when the expert is unable to show a reliable basis for\n\n[his] theory.”). The plaintiff testified that she told Dr. Hill-Daniel during the December 3, 2009\n\nvisit that she had a pain and a knot in her left breast. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 78:13–:14 (“I told\n\nher that I had soreness and tenderness in both of my breasts, and a pain and a knot in my left\n\nbreast.”). Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that the plaintiff did not specify that the knot was in one\n\nparticular breast, Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 4:7–:12 (“As noted in the chart, [the plaintiff] came in\n\nwith a new complaint of breast tenderness and lumpiness. She stated that her breasts were tender\n\nall the time. When I asked her in more detail about that, she actually held under her breasts and\n\nbasically just motioned that both breasts were tender and felt lumpy.”); id. at 18:18–:23 (Upon\n\nquestioning by the Court about whether Dr. Hill-Daniel asked the plaintiff about her use of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      70\n\fterm “knot,” Dr. Hill-Daniel responded, “So, during the course of our exam, I asked her, you\n\nknow, is there a particular place, you know, where do you feel the knot? And she couldn’t give\n\nme any specific place. And when I asked her, she just, again, said, they’re all over. So basically\n\nsaying that both breasts felt sore and knots in them [sic], not one specific knot.”). Yet, the\n\nplaintiff’s recollection that she complained of finding a knot in her left breast is wholly\n\nconsistent with the description of symptoms that she undisputedly gave to medical providers at\n\nHoward University Hospital and Fort Washington Hospital in the following months, see Pl.’s Ex.\n\n104, at 23061 (Howard University Hospital medical record from May 19, 2010 describing chief\n\ncomplaint as “knots on left breast”); Pl.’s Ex. 6, at 6003 (Fort Washington medical record from\n\nAugust 9, 2010 describing patient’s complaint as “knot on LT breast”). The parties also agree\n\nthat the notation on the Unity progress note for the December 3, 2009, visit is ambiguous as to\n\nwhether the complaint of lumpiness pertained to one breast or both breasts. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1013;\n\nDef.’s Ex. 1, at 8 (“Pt also concerned that breast [singular] are [plural] lumpy.”). When\n\nquestioned about the significance of this notation, Dr. Hill-Daniel became particularly defensive.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 59:18–:25 (“Q: And how did you spell breast? Just spell it out for us the\n\nway you wrote it in your note. A: B.R.E.S.T. [sic] Q: Okay. And that would indicate singular?\n\nA: The verb used after that is plural, [are]. So that breast is a typo. Q: Or the word [are] is a\n\ntypo? A: It’s more common to leave off an S than to change a verb.”). In light of all of these\n\nfactors, the Court is inclined to believe the plaintiff’s testimony that she specifically complained\n\nto the healthcare providers at Unity about a knot in her left breast, in addition to complaining that\n\nshe felt tenderness and lumpiness in her breasts generally.\n\n       Dr. Sutherland also testified that the plaintiff’s family history of breast cancer increased\n\nthe importance of including breast cancer on the differential diagnosis because the fact that her\n\n\n\n\n                                                     71\n\ftwo grandmothers were both diagnosed with breast cancer increased her risk. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n69 at 40:4–:8 (“And one of the other reasons, you know, for that is she was at higher risk also\n\nbecause of the family history. She had two grandmothers that had family – or have a history of\n\nbreast cancer, which increases her risk.”). He testified that an article about screening guidelines\n\nfor breast cancer, as part of the Guam breast and cervical cancer early detection program,\n\nsupports that opinion, Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 4:6–:9, and, indeed, the article states that one or\n\nmore first-or second-degree relatives with breast cancer at an early age (less than 40-50 years of\n\nage) can be a red flag suggestive of genetic susceptibility to breast cancer. Pl.’s Ex. 67, at 4.\n\n        Whether the plaintiff informed Dr. Hill-Daniel about her family history of breast cancer\n\nis another disputed matter. The plaintiff testified that she told both Dr. Hill-Daniel and the\n\nmedical assistant at Unity that her two grandmothers had been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 79:16 (responding to counsel’s question “would you describe for us . . .\n\nthe nature of the discussion [that she had with Dr. Hill-Daniel about cancer],” the plaintiff said,\n\n“I told her I had two grandmothers that had breast cancer,”); id. at 128:17–:18, 129:5–:6\n\n(testifying that she “told them at Unity” that she had a family history of breast cancer and that\n\nshe “told them numerous times when I was, when I seen the nurse before I seen Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel”). Dr. Hill-Daniel’s denial that the plaintiff mentioned her grandmothers’ breast cancer is\n\nnot inconsistent with the plaintiff’s testimony that she disclosed this critical family medical\n\nhistory to the medical assistant. Doctors and medical assistants at Unity generally communicate\n\nonly through written notes in the medical record, and any information obtained by the medical\n\nassistant at the short initial interview with a patient about the reason for the visit that is not\n\ndocumented by the assistant may never reach the treating physician. At the same time, a patient\n\nwho has unburdened herself in an initial interview with a medical professional by describing\n\n\n\n\n                                                       72\n\fpertinent symptoms, history or concerns may rightly believe that the key information will be\n\nhandled appropriately and passed along as needed without the need for repetition.\n\n         In this case, the medical assistant’s notes concerning the December 9, 2009 visit do not\n\nrelay any of the deep concern that the plaintiff described herself as having, in large part due to\n\nher grandmothers’ history of breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 80:4–:12. Rather, this note\n\nconsists of abbreviated descriptions of the plaintiff’s concerns documented in three bullet points.\n\nPl.’s Ex. 1, at 1013; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. Important medical history information that the plaintiff\n\ntold the medical assistant may not have reached Dr. Hill-Daniel because of a lapse in the written\n\ncommunication of the medical assistant. The Court credits the plaintiff’s recollection that she\n\nmentioned her grandmothers’ breast cancer to Unity medical personnel based on her testimony\n\nthat her knowledge of what happened with her grandmothers is what prompted her concern about\n\nher own breast pain and lumpiness in the first place, and her request for a mammogram. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 55 at 80:4–:12. According to Dr. Sutherland, Dr. Hill-Daniel had the responsibility\n\nto pursue whether the plaintiff had any relatives with breast cancer beyond her mother and\n\nsisters. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 71:7–:10. The progress note contains no evidence that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel even asked the plaintiff whether she had grandparents with breast cancer. The progress\n\nnote states only that there is no history of breast cancer in “first-degree relatives,” which is\n\ndefined as a mother, sister, father, or brother, and it is silent as to all other degrees of relatives.\n\nPl.’s Ex. 1, at 1013; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. In sum, Dr. Hill-Daniel’s view that the plaintiff had no\n\nfamily history of breast cancer was incorrect because the plaintiff reported her family history at\n\nleast to the medical assistant, the medical assistant clearly did not write it down, and Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel never inquired further. 13\n\n\n13\n  It is also worth noting that during the bench trial, Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she would not have changed her\nassessment or her actions in December 2009 even if she had known about the plaintiff’s grandmothers’ history of\n\n\n                                                              73\n\f         On the basis of the credible expert testimony, the Court therefore finds that the national\n\nstandard of care required Dr. Hill-Daniel to consider breast cancer as part of her differential\n\ndiagnosis for the plaintiff on December 3, 2009.\n\n         Yet Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that breast cancer was not on her differential diagnosis.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 15:1–25, 55:11–:14 (“A: And you knew [that breast cancer in women\n\nunder thirty is most likely diagnosed by detection of a palpable mass] on December 3, 2009, yet\n\nwith this knowledge, you did not have breast cancer on your differential diagnosis, correct? A:\n\nNothing in the -- correct.”). In fact, it is clear that Dr. Hill-Daniel determined at the December\n\n2009 visit that the plaintiff’s condition was decidedly not breast cancer. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified\n\nthat she reassured the plaintiff that her concerns were benign – meaning not cancer. Id. at 13:21–\n\n:22 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony that she reassured the plaintiff that her concerns were “benign”);\n\nid. at 63:9–:11 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony agreeing that “the term benign refers to a condition,\n\ntumor or growth that is not cancerous”). Dr. Hill-Daniel’s reassurance of the plaintiff and clear\n\nminimization of the plaintiff’s own view about the need for a mammogram or some form of\n\ndiagnostic testing clearly colored the urgency with which the future treatment of the plaintiff by\n\nthis physician and Unity subsequently unfolded. When the Court asked Dr. Hill-Daniel why she\n\ndid not tell the plaintiff to follow up within a specified time period, Dr. Hill-Daniel responded:\n\n“At the time, I felt this was a self-limiting process, meaning that I thought her breast pain, her\n\ntenderness, would spontaneously resolve on her own.” Id. at 17:14–:19. 14\n\n\nbreast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 7:21–8:6 (“Q: And if she had told you that she had a family history of breast\ncancer, with respect to her two grandmothers, how would have changed your assessment, or would it have? A:\nWell, for that particular visit, it may not have changed my plan of care. But I would have counseled [the plaintiff]\ndifferently about the need for future screening . . . .”).\n14\n   The defendant asserts that at the December 2009 appointment, Dr. Hill-Daniel diagnosed the plaintiff with\n“fibrocystic changes,” also known as “fibrotic disease,” see 3rd FOF Table ¶¶ 48(B) (“Her assessment was coded as\n‘breast disorders not otherwise specified.’ It gives reference to the patient’s pain and that it is mostly fibrocystic\nchanges.”), 62(B) (“Dr. Hill-Daniel believed from her initial assessment that the plaintiff had fibrocystic disease of\nboth breasts.”). This characterization is simply not supported by the medical record, the diagnostic code that Dr.\n\n\n                                                              74\n\f         The plaintiff’s experts next testified that because Dr. Hill-Daniel was required to have\n\nbreast cancer on the differential diagnosis for the plaintiff, she was also required to take steps to\n\nrule it out. Dr. Sutherland was the only expert who opined that based on the plaintiff’s\n\npresentation as a twenty-four year old non-lactating woman with noncyclic pain and no\n\nsuspicious findings on examination, the national standard of care required Dr. Hill-Daniel to\n\nrefer her for a diagnostic ultrasound. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 42:1–:7. He based his opinion on\n\nan algorithm published by the California Department of Health as a guideline for primary care\n\nphysicians in 2005, and incorporated into the Guam Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection\n\nProgram Screening Guidelines for Breast Cancer. Pl.’s Exs. 67, 106; Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at\n\n43:23–44:3. Although the defendant attacks this study as inapplicable to a twenty-four year old\n\nwoman, there is no indication that the algorithm is dependent on age. Moreover, the defendant’s\n\nexperts did not present any competing study or protocol based in the scientific literature that\n\nwould suggest that whether to order diagnostic imaging depends on the patient’s age. 15\n\n         Dr. Sutherland ultimately testified that at the very least, the national standard of care\n\nrequired Dr. Hill-Daniel to schedule the plaintiff for a return visit in the next thirty to sixty days\n\nto see whether or not her complaints of noncyclic pain and knots remained and to repeat the\n\nbreast examination. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 37:19–:24. Dr. Margo also testified that the next\n\nstep required by the national standard of care was to schedule an appointment for the plaintiff to\n\nfollow-up about her breast complaints in the next four to six weeks. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at\n\n61:15–:23. Even the defendant’s expert, Dr. Koch, opined that Dr. Hill-Daniel had “an\n\n\nHill-Daniel used, or the testimony in this case. In fact, Dr. Carter testified that fibrotic disease “comes and goes\nwith menses,” Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 133:15–:16, and Dr. Hill-Daniel clearly documented in the medical record\n“no change with menstrual cycle,” Pl.’s Ex. 1 at 1013; Def.’s Ex. 1 at 8.\n15\n  Although defendant’s counsel alluded to a competing protocol during her cross-examination of Dr. Sutherland,\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 83:23 –87:6, the article to which she referred was not admitted as evidence in this case and\nnone of defendant’s expert witnesses testified that their opinions were informed by it.\n\n\n                                                               75\n\fobligation to say, if your symptoms do not go away . . . with the interventions that I suggested,\n\nplease come back to be reevaluated.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 127:17–:21. Dr. Hill-Daniel took\n\nno such steps to further assess whether the plaintiff had breast cancer. Rather, she reassured the\n\nplaintiff of the benign nature of her concern, told her that no imaging was warranted,\n\nrecommended that she change her bra, and prescribed her a strong dose of Ibuprofen.\n\n        While there is no dispute that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not schedule, or insist on the scheduling\n\nof, a follow-up appointment for the plaintiff in the next two months, there is some dispute over\n\nwhat Dr. Hill-Daniel did tell the plaintiff regarding follow-up, if anything. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\ntestified that she recalled telling the plaintiff “to follow up if she didn’t have any relief of the\n\npain, or if her symptoms persisted,” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 16:12–:18. The plaintiff, on the\n\nother hand, testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel never mentioned any follow-up to her at all. Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 70 at 20:22–21:7. Under the heading of “follow-up,” the progress note contains only\n\nthe nonspecific notation, “PRN,” – meaning “as needed.” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8;\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 16:8–:9 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony that PRN stands for “as needed”).\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds the plaintiff’s testimony to be credible and finds that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel did not adequately explain to the plaintiff when, or even if, she should follow up.\n\n        Whatever Dr. Hill-Daniel told the plaintiff about follow-up, there is no question that she\n\nunwarrantedly told the plaintiff that her symptoms were not cause for concern. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\ntestified that she told the plaintiff that her symptoms were benign, i.e. non-cancerous, Pl.’s Ex. 1,\n\nat 1013 & Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8 (progress note for December 3, 2009 visit, stating under “treatment”\n\nthat “Pt reassured about benign nature iof [sic] her concern”); see also Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n63:9–:11 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony agreeing that “the term benign refers to a condition, tumor\n\nor growth that is not cancerous”), which, according to Dr. Margo, Dr. Hill-Daniel did not have\n\n\n\n\n                                                       76\n\fenough information to do. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 60:10–:14. The problem with making such\n\nan unsubstantiated assurance, according to Dr. Margo, is the patient will stop paying attention to\n\nthe symptoms or will not bring them up to the physician again in the future because she thinks\n\nthat the problem is benign. Id. at 61:3–:11. Dr. Margo explained that Dr. Hill-Daniel “didn’t\n\nleave the door open for something other than a benign problem.” Id. at 60:16–:19. Even if Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel had told the plaintiff during her December 2009 visit that she should follow-up if her\n\nsymptoms persisted, she also conveyed the clear indication that the plaintiff should have no\n\nconcern about any danger from the persistence of her symptoms. The defendant’s expert, Dr.\n\nKoch, conceded to the Court that the only reason a patient would follow-up about persistent\n\nsymptoms after being assured of their benign nature would be for further pain management.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 91:20–92:5 (suggesting other medical modalities for pain management\n\nthat the doctor could have prescribed if the patient were to return complaining that her symptoms\n\nwere persisting). 16\n\n         The defendant’s experts, Dr. Bethea and Dr. Koch, testified that in their opinions the\n\nnational standard of care did not require Dr. Hill-Daniel to schedule a follow-up appointment or\n\norder diagnostic imaging. As with their opinions about the differential diagnosis, both of them\n\nrelied primarily on the plaintiff’s age and the fact that her complaints of pain and lumpiness were\n\n“bilateral” or occurring in both breasts. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 32:8–:12 (“Twenty-four year-\n\nold with bilateral benign fibrocystic findings, it would be inappropriate to list cancer as a very\n\nreal concern simply because it would not be a very real concern. It would be a very rare\n\n16\n  Despite Dr. Hill-Daniel’s failure to schedule a follow-up visit for the plaintiff, Dr. Hill-Daniel had additional\nopportunities to follow-up with the plaintiff when she saw the plaintiff for unrelated complaints on January 8, 2011,\nand April 30, 2011. While the Court declines to hold as a general matter that doctors must review all of a patient’s\npast symptoms and discuss them with the patient to ensure that they are not persisting, in this case, the progress\nnotes for the January and April, 2011 visits reflect that the plaintiff was still being prescribed pain-killing\nmedication for her breast pain and this, at a minimum, could have prompted an inquiry into whether that medication\nwas still needed. Dr. Hill-Daniel missed these two opportunities to inquire into the persistence of the plaintiff’s\nbreast symptoms. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 21:5–:9; 77:21–:23.\n\n\n                                                             77\n\foccurrence.”); id. at 86:19–87:7 (explaining that the national standard of care does not require a\n\nreferral for imaging when “if you listen to the patient, you listen to what she has to say, she’s\n\ntalking about a bilateral issue. She is talking about the breasts being uncomfortable, and she\n\nfeels that they are lumpy, and you do a physical examination on the patient, and you don’t find\n\nanything there”); id. at 89:8–:15 (“[S]he took in the chief complaint; she did a physical exam;\n\nshe made an assessment, and she gave the patient suggestions for management, and then she\n\ninvited the patient to come back should the symptoms continue. It was a perfectly reasonable\n\nthing to do in a twenty-four-year-old woman complaining of bilateral breast pain and lumpiness\n\nin her breasts.”). The Court discounts the value of these opinions for the same reasons the\n\ndefendant’s experts’ opinions regarding the differential diagnosis are discounted: not only is the\n\nage of the patient not dispositive as to whether a breast “knot” is benign, the plaintiff’s testimony\n\nthat she complained specifically about a knot in her left breast is credible. Moreover, the defense\n\nexperts did not address the fact that the plaintiff’s breast complaints were noncyclical. Thus, the\n\ngrounds on which the defense experts based their opinion about the defendant’s compliance with\n\nthe national standard of care at the December 2009 visit in terms of diagnosis, follow-up care,\n\nand treatment are not predicated on the material factual findings in this case. This faulty premise\n\nalso invalidates Dr. Bethea’s testimony that if a physician were to schedule a follow-up with\n\nevery patient presenting with the plaintiff’s symptoms, it would “flood the system unnecessarily\n\nwith essentially zero return on your effort.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 27:1–:4.\n\n       Accordingly, the Court finds that Dr. Hill-Daniel breached the national standard of care\n\non December 3, 2009 by, at the very least, not scheduling a follow-up visit for the plaintiff in\n\nthirty to sixty days to reassess the plaintiff’s complaints of bilateral breast pain and a knot in her\n\nleft breast, and to repeat a breast examination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      78\n\f                  2.       August–October 2010\n\n         The plaintiff next argues that Dr. Hill Daniel and Unity breached the national standard of\n\ncare by delaying for more than two months the plaintiff’s appointment for a mammogram\n\nreferral after the plaintiff first attempted to make the appointment. The plaintiff testified that,\n\nafter her visit to the emergency room at Fort Washington Hospital where she was advised that\n\nobtaining a mammogram was “very important,” 17 she called Unity the very next day and asked\n\nthe receptionist to schedule the first available appointment to see Dr. Hill Daniel because she\n\nneeded a mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 92:1–:13. She was first given an appointment\n\ndate of September 9, 2010, but Unity cancelled that appointment and another rescheduled\n\nappointment for September 24, 2011 before the plaintiff finally saw Dr. Hill-Daniel on October\n\n18, 2010. Pl.’s Ex. 33.\n\n         The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Sutherland, testified that when Unity cancelled the plaintiff’s\n\nSeptember 9, 2010, appointment, the standard of care required Unity to reschedule it “as quickly\n\nas possible, and I think certainly within a week at the maximum.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at\n\n51:16–:18. He opined that if it were not possible for Dr. Hill-Daniel to see her during that time,\n\nshe should have been scheduled to see one of Dr. Hill-Daniel’s colleagues. Id. at 51:18–22. As\n\nto the second time the appointment was rescheduled, Dr. Sutherland opined that rescheduling the\n\nappointment as quickly as possible was particularly imperative because the plaintiff had already\n\nbeen waiting to be seen for several extra weeks. Id. at 52:5–:9.\n\n\n\n\n17\n  The defendant appears to dispute that the health-care providers at Fort Washington Hospital told the plaintiff that\nshe needed a mammogram. See 3rd FOF Table ¶ 90(B) (“There is no indication from the Fort Washington medical\nrecord that the Plaintiff was told to get a mammogram.”). However, the progress note from the plaintiff’s October\n18, 2011 visit with Dr. Hill-Daniel, which states “P tseen [sic] in ER regarding mass but was told to f/u with PMD\nfor mammogram,” is consistent with the plaintiff’s testimony that she was told at Fort Washington Hospital that she\nneeded a mammogram, Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 90:12–:14.\n\n\n                                                              79\n\f       Dr. Sutherland based his opinion on “the fact that the reason for that request [for a\n\nmammogram] was the fact that a mass had been found at Fort Washington and she was told to\n\nproceed to get – see her primary care physician for further testing.” Id. at 51:2–:7. There is no\n\nevidence in the record, however, that the plaintiff actually told the receptionist at the time that\n\nshe called to make her appointment, or during the period of time over which her appointments\n\nwere rescheduled, about her experience at Fort Washington, the mass they palpated in her left\n\nbreast, or their recommendation that it was “very important” that she follow up with her primary\n\ncare physician. As described above, the plaintiff testified only that she asked for the first\n\navailable appointment because she needed a mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 92:1–:13.\n\n       The Court is troubled that the receptionist did not inquire into the basis for the urgency\n\nthat the plaintiff expressed in seeing Dr. Hill-Daniel, particularly in the face of her explicit\n\nrequest for a mammogram referral, and with the length of time that that it took for Unity to fit the\n\nplaintiff in to be seen by a physician. While clerical personnel certainly are not expected to have\n\nthe same level of expertise as other medical professionals, personnel responsible for cancelling\n\nand re-scheduling appointments at a medical clinic should have sufficient training to inquire into\n\na patient’s perspective or understanding regarding the timing needs for an doctor’s visit, or to\n\nconfer with a physician when the schedule does not permit an appointment within the time-frame\n\nthe patient believed is required. Instead, the Unity scheduling personnel, with whom the plaintiff\n\nspoke, approached the making of an appointment as a purely ministerial task without any\n\nmedical implications, and this is simply not the case when the context is a medical clinic\n\nproviding primary care.\n\n       Moreover, the defendant’s assertion that the plaintiff should have made an appointment\n\nwith another doctor or visited the clinic as a “walk-in” is simply not persuasive. Def.’s Concls.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      80\n\fat 11–12. The doctor at the Fort Washington Hospital Emergency Room specifically told the\n\nplaintiff to “go back to your doctor.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 90:22–:24. At the time, Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel was the plaintiff’s primary care physician and she was the doctor that the plaintiff had\n\ninitially gone to with her breast complaints. The defendant also presented no evidence that the\n\nplaintiff was advised by anyone at Unity at the time of the cancellation of her two appointments\n\nwith her primary care physician, or at any other time, that she had the option of scheduling an\n\nappointment with another doctor, or that she could continue to come in for walk-in visits after\n\nshe had been assigned a primary care physician. Although the plaintiff had visited Unity as a\n\nwalk-in patient in the past, all of the records of her walk-in visits are from before Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nbecame assigned as the plaintiff’s primary care physician. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 14–16; see also Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 72 at 82:5–:10.\n\n       Yet, because the plaintiff has not provided any expert opinion regarding the national\n\nstandard of care applicable to medical clinics for the re-scheduling of cancelled doctor visits in\n\nlight of the facts as presented in this case, the Court cannot find that the plaintiff has proven by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the delay attendant to the cancellation and re-scheduling of\n\ntwo appointments that the plaintiff had with Dr. Hill-Daniel in September and October, 2011\n\nconstituted a breach of the national standard of care.\n\n               3.      October 18, 2010–March 8, 2011\n\n       Finally, the plaintiff asserts that Dr. Hill-Daniel was negligent in permitting almost five\n\nmonths to pass between the October 18, 2010 appointment and her March 8, 2011 breast cancer\n\ndiagnosis.\n\n       There is no dispute that Dr. Hill-Daniel examined the plaintiff on October 18, 2010, and\n\npalpated “multiple small mobile nodules” in her left breast and lymph nodes in her left axilla.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      81\n\fPl.’s Ex. 1, at 1060; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. While all of the experts agreed that Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nordered the correct tests in a permissible progression, both of the plaintiff’s family medicine\n\nexperts testified that under these circumstances, the national standard of care required a quick\n\nevaluation through this progression of imaging and biopsy to determine whether the\n\nabnormalities were breast cancer. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 81:15–:17 (Dr. Margo’s testimony\n\nthat the national standard of care required “very quick evaluation with imaging and referral to a\n\nspecialist to take care of it if it turns out, in fact, to be breast cancer”); Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at\n\n53:16–:18 (“In light of those findings with the history, it was Dr. Hill-Daniel’s responsibility to\n\nexpedite diagnostic testing as soon as possible.”). Both of the plaintiff’s experts also testified\n\nthat the national standard of care required that the plaintiff’s breast cancer be diagnosed in no\n\nmore than two to three weeks in total. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 82:10–:25 (Dr. Margo); Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 69 at 54:19–55:5 (Dr. Sutherland). Within this overarching timeframe, Dr. Sutherland\n\ntestified that the national standard of care required that the diagnostic ultrasound be done within\n\na week of the October visit, Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 54:2–:12, and Dr. Margo testified that the\n\nrequired time was two weeks, Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 82:10–82:25.\n\n        The defendant’s expert, Dr. Koch, testified that the national standard of care was satisfied\n\nby the physician prescribing a six-week follow-up period during which the patient should get the\n\nultrasound. When pressed on the appropriate timeframe for obtaining diagnostic tests, however,\n\nDr. Koch expressed significant doubt about his qualifications to make any judgment about how\n\nlong diagnostic measures for breast cancer should take. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 11:16–:22 (“I\n\nthink an oncologist could speak to that much better than I . . . . I would probably let an\n\noncologist, you know, speak [to] that.”). The Court therefore does not credit his judgment about\n\nwhat the standard of care requires with respect to the diagnostic process for breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       82\n\f       The defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s actions did not violate\n\nthe national standard of care, but said, in response to questioning by the Court, that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel’s detection of lymph node involvement was a “game-changer,” and that once that\n\nhappened, it was not appropriate to wait six weeks before an ultrasound was performed. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 73 at 40:24–41:2. He then attempted to backpedal by redefining the national\n\nstandard of care as dependent on the practical circumstances under which the care is delivered –\n\nin particular, the financial circumstances of the medical institution and the type of insurance that\n\nthe patient has. See id. at 44:4–47:11. Finally, he confused the matter by opining that “[t]he\n\ntime frame does not dictate the compliance with the standard of care. It dictates compliance with\n\nbest practice.” Id. at 49:6–:9. The law in this jurisdiction, however, establishes that the conduct\n\nof a health care provider, whether a physician or institution, should be measured against the\n\nnational standard of care, which in turn depends on the course that is followed nationally by\n\nphysicians or institutions in the same field as the defendant. Washington v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr.,\n\n579 A.2d 177, 181 (D.C. 1990) (defining national standard of care for an institution as reliant on\n\nwhat a reasonably prudent institution, at the time of the plaintiff’s injury, and according to\n\nnational standards, would have done). Moreover, the standard must be established through\n\n“reference to a published standard, [discussion] of the described course of treatment with\n\npractitioners outside the District . . . at seminars or conventions, or through presentation of\n\nrelevant data.” Strickland v. Pinder, 899 A.2d 770, 770 (D.C. 2006); see also Travers v. District\n\nof Columbia, 672 A.2d 566, 568 (D.C. 1996) (“There must be, then, evidence that a particular\n\ncourse of treatment is followed nationally.”). Dr. Bethea’s opinion that it was appropriate for Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel to prescribe a six-week follow up period is not based on a national standard for\n\nfamily care physicians or for institutions that offer primary care services to patients. Rather, it\n\n\n\n\n                                                     83\n\fseems to be based on his opinion that different standards apply depending on the institutional\n\ncontext in which treatment is delivered. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 46:19–:23 (“These\n\ndays, unfortunately, doctors lose control of the situation in big medical centers, such as where\n\nthis occurred. They don’t lose control of it in a practice like mine. So it’s two entirely different\n\ncircumstances.”). That understanding does not comport with the law in this jurisdiction.\n\n       Assessing whether Dr. Hill-Daniel satisfied any of the expert witness’s constructions of\n\nthe national standard of care, the Court must consider that Dr. Hill Daniel did nothing to expedite\n\nany of the tests that she ordered for the plaintiff, and that there is no evidence that she or any of\n\nher staff explained to the plaintiff the appropriate timeframe for obtaining the tests or the reason\n\nwhy it was important to obtain them quickly. As to the ultrasound, Dr. Hill-Daniel wrote a\n\nreferral and sent it to Ms. Jones for processing. Although Dr. Hill-Daniel asked Ms. Jones to\n\nexpedite the insurance authorization process, the plaintiff was not notified that Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nhad asked Ms. Jones to expedite the referral, and Dr. Hill-Daniel did not direct Ms. Jones to\n\ndiscuss the timing of the ultrasound with the plaintiff. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she\n\n“basically stressed the importance of her to get the study done and come back to me for the\n\nresults so we could figure out what else we needed to do,” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:1–:3, but\n\nthis nonspecific recollection does not speak to the timeframe she used or the explanation she\n\ngave for why “figure[ing] out what else we needed to do” was important. Moreover, there is no\n\nnotation on the progress note that Dr. Hill-Daniel actually told the plaintiff the importance of\n\nhaving the procedure done quickly, and the plaintiff testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not give her\n\nany indication of how quickly the procedure should be done. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 97:4–:6\n\n(“Q: [D]id Dr. Hill-Daniel tell you about how quickly you were supposed to have the ultrasound\n\nperformed? A: She didn’t give me no discussion about the ultrasound.”). Dr. Hill-Daniel also\n\n\n\n\n                                                      84\n\ftestified on cross-examination that she did not remember specifically telling the plaintiff that she\n\nshould get an appointment for the ultrasound within one to two weeks. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n96:25–97:3. Rather, the notation in the progress note says that the prescribed follow-up is six\n\nweeks, and Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that “I felt six weeks was enough time for her to get the\n\nreferral, make her appointments, get the exam done and report back to me.” Id. at 28:24–29:5.\n\n       Thus, reviewing the evidence as a whole shows that while Dr. Hill-Daniel may have told\n\nthe plaintiff that the ultrasound was important to diagnose her symptoms, she did not tell the\n\nplaintiff that she needed to get it done quickly or explain that the reason it was important was to\n\nrule out the possibility that she had breast cancer. Relaying the urgency of having the test\n\nperformed quickly would have been particularly important in this case, given that Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nhad assured the plaintiff that her concerns were benign and could be treated with a change in her\n\nbra, only ten months earlier.\n\n       Moreover, although it is not clear that Dr. Hill-Daniel told the plaintiff to follow-up at all,\n\nthe best-case scenario is that Dr. Hill-Daniel told the plaintiff that the follow-up time was six-\n\nweeks. This is far longer than the one to two-week timeframe that the plaintiff’s experts testified\n\nthat the national standard of care required. Even the defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified that\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel’s detection of lymph node involvement was a “game changer,” and that once that\n\nhappened, it was not appropriate to wait six weeks before an ultrasound was performed. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 73 at 39:23–41:2. The defendant’s other family medicine expert, Dr. Koch, who\n\nasserted that Dr. Hill-Daniel was within the standard of care by giving the plaintiff a six-week\n\nfollow-up for the October 18, 2011 appointment, also testified that “there’s certainly an\n\nobligation on a physician’s part to impart some need to expedite things.” Id. at 113:2–:3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     85\n\f       More troubling is that on November 3, 2011 – more than two weeks after the October 18,\n\n2011 visit – Dr. Hill-Daniel became aware that the plaintiff had gone to Providence Hospital to\n\nhave the ultrasound done, and that she was unable to have the procedure because of an error that\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel herself had made with the IDC-9 code on the plaintiff’s referral form. When Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel corrected the code, she was aware that the ultrasound technician had already left for\n\nthe day and, thus, that the plaintiff would have to reschedule the ultrasound appointment.\n\nNonetheless, Dr. Hill-Daniel still did nothing to ensure that the plaintiff would be able to have\n\nthe ultrasound done quickly. She did not call the radiologist at Providence Hospital or direct her\n\nstaff to call. She did not even call the plaintiff to make sure she was aware that she should try to\n\nhave the procedure rescheduled quickly. Dr. Sutherland testified that as the physician\n\nresponsible for the management of the patient, Dr. Hill-Daniel was required to take a leadership\n\nrole and/or delegate to her staff to make sure that the ultrasound was done within a week. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 69 at 55:14–57:7. Yet, two weeks after she wrote the referral, Dr. Hill-Daniel knew\n\nthat the plaintiff still had not been able to have the ultrasound and Dr. Hill-Daniel did nothing.\n\n       Dr. Hill-Daniel finally received the ultrasound report on December 27, 2011, with the\n\nalarming finding that “a more aggressive lesion cannot be excluded.” Pl.’s Ex. 13, at 1; Def.’s\n\nEx. 5, at 1. Dr. Hill-Daniel also saw the radiologist’s recommendation that she refer the plaintiff\n\nfor a mammogram. At this point, Dr. Hill-Daniel had to be aware that it had taken the plaintiff\n\ntwo months to have the diagnostic ultrasound. In addition, Dr. Hill-Daniel knew that the\n\nabnormal result from the ultrasound meant that the plaintiff potentially had breast cancer. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 58 at 98:3–:9 (“Q: You knew [the plaintiff] potentially might have cancer. And\n\nyou knew now that you had an abnormal result from an ultrasound, right? A: Yes. Q: And you\n\ndidn’t tell her anything about how quickly she should get the mammogram? A: No, I can’t\n\n\n\n\n                                                     86\n\frecall speaking to her.”). Yet, Dr. Hill-Daniel still did nothing to ensure that the plaintiff\n\nreceived a quick diagnosis or at least was aware of the urgency of the situation. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\ndid not even contact the plaintiff herself, let alone take the time to explain to the plaintiff that the\n\nmammogram needed to be done quickly and why. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 113:2–:3. Rather, Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel generated a referral for a mammogram of the left breast as directed by the\n\nradiologist, sent it to Ms. Jones for authorization, and asked Ms. Jones to call the plaintiff to pick\n\nup the referral form and schedule an appointment. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 41:11–:15. In fact,\n\nwhile Dr. Hill-Daniel marked the referral for the mammogram as urgent and sent it to Ms. Jones\n\nelectronically on December 30, 2011 in order to expedite the insurance authorization process,\n\nshe did not even take care to discover that Ms. Jones was out of the office and would not return –\n\nor therefore process the referral – for an entire week. As a result, the plaintiff’s diagnosis was\n\ndelayed further.\n\n        The plaintiff finally had the mammogram, which she had originally requested in\n\nDecember, 2009 and, again, in September, 2010 and, again, in October, 2010, performed on\n\nFebruary 9, 2011. After receiving a call from the radiologist at Providence Hospital regarding\n\nthe abnormal results of the plaintiff’s mammogram, Dr. Hill-Daniel contacted the plaintiff on\n\nFebruary 10, 2011. Dr. Hill-Daniel told the plaintiff during this telephone call that the plaintiff\n\nneeded to be seen by a surgeon for a biopsy, but she still did not communicate the urgency of the\n\nsituation to her or the reason for the biopsy. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 111:8–112:1. In fact, Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel testified that she would not have used the word cancer with the plaintiff because you\n\n“don’t have that diagnosis until the biopsy is done.” Id. at 111:23–:25. Despite knowing how\n\nlong the diagnostic process had already taken, and despite having admitting privileges at\n\nProvidence Hospital, Dr. Hill-Daniel did not call the surgeon to whom she referred the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                                       87\n\fin order to expedite the biopsy. See id. 116:21–:25 (Dr. Hill-Daniel acknowledged that it was\n\nmore likely that the test would have been scheduled quicker if she had called Providence\n\nHospital than if the plaintiff called). The biopsy was not performed until March 8, 2011 – nearly\n\na month after Dr. Hill-Daniel first learned about the mammogram results, and nearly five months\n\nafter she had palpated the nodules in the plaintiff’s left breast and the lymph nodes in the axilla.\n\n       Defendant cites Forman v. Pillsbury, 753 F. Supp. 14, 19 (D.D.C. 1990), for the\n\nproposition that a rule requiring a physician to take significant measures to ensure that a properly\n\ninformed patient follows the doctor’s instructions would be unworkable and overly paternalistic.\n\nDef.’s Concls. at 14. That case is distinguishable. In Forman, doctors at Mt. Sinai Hospital had\n\nprescribed a medication for the patient and, aware that the medication could suppress white\n\nblood cell production, they recommended in a clear communication to the patient that he follow\n\na schedule to closely monitor his white blood cell count while on the medication. Id. at 15–17.\n\nThe patient failed to adhere to the schedule, however, and while on the medication, the patient’s\n\nwhite blood cell count dropped, causing him to suffer coronary arrest and die. Id. at 16. His\n\nmother sued his physician for medical malpractice, arguing that the monitoring schedule\n\nrepresented the standard of care and that her son’s physicians were required to abide by it. Id.\n\nThe only allegation of negligence at trial was the doctor’s failure to monitor the patient’s white\n\nblood cell count on one particular occasion. The court first found that the plaintiff had not\n\nproved that the failure to monitor on that one occasion was the proximate cause of the patient’s\n\nharm. Id. at 18. It next found that even if there were sufficient evidence to support a finding of\n\nproximate cause, the plaintiff had not presented sufficient expert testimony to support her theory\n\nof the standard of care. Id. The court stated that the plaintiff’s expert discounted the fact that the\n\nplaintiff “was well aware of the schedule and the importance of monitoring the patient’s white\n\n\n\n\n                                                     88\n\fblood count” and that nonetheless, the plaintiff failed to take the patient to the doctor\n\nconsistently. Id. at 19. The court rejected the expert’s testimony that a doctor has “the duty to\n\nmake sure that a patient comes to the office for treatment,” holding instead that the “defendant’s\n\nobligation consisted of informing plaintiff of the need for monitoring and performing the tests\n\nwith plaintiff’s cooperation.” Id.\n\n         This Court agrees that the patient must take responsibility for following a doctor’s orders,\n\nbut the problem here is that the patient was not given the information that she needed and to\n\nwhich the national standard of care entitled her, in order to obtain the appropriate level of care.\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel failed to express the urgency with which the plaintiff needed to have the\n\ndiagnostic tests performed and failed to explain to her the appropriate time frame to schedule the\n\ntests. Moreover, after discovering that her own error delayed the plaintiff’s ability to obtain the\n\nmedically necessary tests, Dr. Hill-Daniel still did nothing to expedite the timeframe or even to\n\nimpart to the plaintiff that the timeframe should be expedited. With clear knowledge of the\n\nlength of time it took for the plaintiff to have the ultrasound performed, Dr. Hill-Daniel still took\n\nno steps to assist the plaintiff in obtaining the follow-on mammogram and the biopsy in a more\n\nexpedited fashion or even to explain to the plaintiff that it was important that she do so. Unlike\n\nin Forman, there is no evidence here that the plaintiff was “well aware” of the appropriate\n\nschedule for obtaining her diagnostic tests or why it was important that they be done quickly.\n\n         At a minimum, all four experts ultimately agreed that the national standard of care\n\nrequired Dr. Hill-Daniel to impart some need to expedite testing once she palpated the nodules in\n\nthe plaintiff’s left breast and lymph nodes and to not impede the plaintiff’s ability to do so. 18 Dr.\n\n\n18\n  As explained above, plaintiff’s experts’ reliably testified that the appropriate schedule was one to two weeks to\nobtain the diagnostic ultrasound, and two to three weeks to reach the ultimate diagnosis. As a practical matter,\nhowever, the Court finds that the standard is well short of the eight weeks it actually took to obtain the diagnostic\nultrasound and the five months that it took to reach the ultimate diagnosis in this case.\n\n\n                                                               89\n\fHill-Daniel failed to do that. Therefore, the plaintiff has successfully proven that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel’s actions – or inaction – breached the national standard of care.\n\n       C.        THE TREATING PHYSICIAN’S BREACH OF THE NATIONAL\n                 STANDARD OF CARE WAS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE\n                 PLAINTIFF’S PROGRESSION FROM STAGE I TO STAGE IV CANCER.\n\n       The Court also finds that the plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel’s breach of the national standard of care caused her breast cancer to progress\n\nfrom a Stage I curable disease to the Stage IV incurable disease that she now faces.\n\n       “It is a bedrock rule of . . . tort . . . law that a defendant is only liable for harms he\n\nproximately caused.” United States v. Monzel, 641 F.3d 528, 535 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing\n\nRESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM § 26 cmt. a\n\n(2010) (calling proximate cause a “requirement[] for liability in tort”)); see also McGaughey v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, 684 F.3d 1355, 1358 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“A plaintiff claiming negligence\n\nmust prove not only that the defendant owed her a duty of care that was breached but that the\n\nbreach proximately caused her injury. Failure to show proximate cause is fatal to a negligence\n\nclaim.”) (internal citations omitted); W. Page Keeton et al., PROSSER AND KEETON ON THE LAW\n\nOF TORTS § 41,   at 263 (5th ed. 1984) (“An essential element of the plaintiff’s cause of action for\n\nnegligence, or . . . any other tort, is that there be some reasonable connection between the act or\n\nomission of the defendant and the damage which the plaintiff has suffered. This connection\n\nusually is dealt with by the courts in terms of what is called ‘proximate cause’ . . . .”)). To show\n\nproximate cause, a plaintiff must proffer expert testimony “based on a reasonable degree of\n\nmedical certainty, that the defendant’s negligence is more likely than anything else to have been\n\nthe cause (or a cause) of the plaintiff’s injuries.” Giordano v. Sherwood, 968 A.2d 494, 502\n\n(D.C. 2009) (quoting Psychiatric Inst. of Wash. v. Allen, 509 A.2d 619, 624 (D.C. 1986)). “The\n\n\n\n\n                                                       90\n\f‘more likely than not’ standard is firmly embedded in our law.” Grant v. Am. Nat’l Red Cross,\n\n745 A.2d 316, 319 (D.C. 2000).\n\n         The parties do not grapple with the application of this standard to a case, like this one,\n\nwhere the plaintiff claims that the physician’s negligence was her failure to diagnose an existing\n\ncondition that, when left untreated, would progress to an incurable and deadly disease. In\n\nFlores-Hernandez v. United States, 910 F. Supp. 2d 64 (D.D.C. 2012), another judge on this\n\nCourt addressed application of the causation standard to a physician who was negligent in failing\n\nto diagnose the plaintiff’s cancer at an earlier stage. The plaintiff alleged that the physician\n\nnegligently delayed referring her for diagnostic gynecological testing for cervical cancer and\n\nthat, had the doctor referred her for testing earlier, specialists would have diagnosed and\n\ncompletely treated her condition as a pre-malignancy or early stage cancer, rather than Stage\n\nIVA cervical cancer, as it was ultimately diagnosed two years later. Id. After finding that the\n\nplaintiff had sustained her burden on negligence, the court characterized the plaintiff’s burden on\n\ncausation as proving that if the plaintiff had been referred to a gynecologist sooner, it was more\n\nlikely than not that the course of treatment she received would have led to the treatment and\n\neradication of her condition sooner, before it advanced to stage IVA. See id. at 77–78. 19\n\n         Similarly here, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that if Dr. Hill-Daniel had\n\nsatisfied the national standard of care, it is more likely than not that the course of treatment she\n\n19\n   There is some ambiguity as to whether the “more likely than not” standard applies in the narrow category of cases\ninvolving negligent treatment of a potentially fatal condition. In Grant v. Am. Nat’l Red Cross, the D.C. Court of\nAppeals left open the possibility that a previous case, Ferell v. Rosenbaum, 691 A.2d 641 (D.C. 1997), had eased the\nburden of proof in such cases to the “lost chance” doctrine, i.e., that if proper treatment had been given in\naccordance with the standard of care, the patient would have a greater chance of avoiding harm. 745 A.2d 316, 322\n(D.C. 2000). The Grant court stated: “In such a case, the lost chance doctrine may well make sense because of the\ndifficulty of differentiating between the consequences of a pre-existing condition and those flowing from the\nnegligent failure to ameliorate it.” Id. at 322. The court, however, refused to establish such a separate standard, id.\nat 321 (“Upon analysis, we do not read Ferrell as deviating from the basic standard of proof of causation by\nprobability.”), and ultimately, the court distinguished the case before it from Ferell on the facts. Id. at 322–23. This\ncourt need not determine whether Ferrell eased the burden of proof for causation in this case, because the plaintiff\nhas proved causation under the well-established stricter standard.\n\n\n                                                               91\n\fwould have received would have led to the treatment and cure of her breast cancer. To\n\ndetermine whether the plaintiff has satisfied that burden, the Court will evaluate the sufficiency\n\nof the plaintiff’s expert testimony to show, based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\n\nfirst, that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s satisfaction of the standard of care would have led to a diagnosis\n\nwhen the cancer was at an earlier stage, and next, that if the plaintiff’s cancer had been\n\ndiagnosed at that earlier stage, is it more likely than not that the course of treatment she would\n\nhave received would have led to the treatment and eradication of her cancer.\n\n               1. A Follow-up Examination In Compliance With the Standard of Care\n                  Within Thirty to Sixty Days after the Plaintiff’s December 3, 2009 visit\n                  Would More Likely Than Not Have Produced A Cancer Diagnosis While\n                  the Condition was Stage I.\n\n       Relying on the opinions of her experts Dr. Tucker and Dr. Pushkas, the plaintiff argues\n\nthat if Dr. Hill-Daniel had satisfied the standard of care on December 3, 2009 by setting up an\n\nappointment for the plaintiff to return after thirty to sixty days in order to reevaluate her breast\n\npain and knots, instead of reassuring her during that visit that her symptoms were benign, the\n\nplaintiff’s breast cancer was more likely to have been diagnosed while it was Stage I. Notably,\n\nthe defendant has not contested that diagnostic imaging would have led to a breast cancer\n\ndiagnosis, even as early as December 2009. Instead, the defendant argues, based on testimony\n\nfrom its expert Dr. Feigert, that the plaintiff’s breast cancer was already at Stage III-B or even\n\nStage IV at the time of her first appointment with Dr. Hill-Daniel expressing concerns about her\n\nbreasts and requesting a mammogram. Thus, according to the defendant, even if Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nbreached the standard of care in her treatment of the plaintiff in December 2009, this was not the\n\nproximate cause of her Stage IV breast cancer. For the reasons explained below, Dr. Feigert’s\n\nopinion is simply not persuasive. The Court concludes that the plaintiff has carried her burden of\n\nshowing that had Dr. Hill-Daniel directed the plaintiff to return for another visit in thirty to sixty\n\n\n\n                                                      92\n\fdays after December 3, 2009, it is more likely than not that her breast cancer would have been\n\ndetected while it was Stage I.\n\n       To explain this conclusion, the Court will first address the expert testimony regarding\n\nwhen the plaintiff’s cancer would have been diagnosed if Dr. Hill-Daniel had satisfied the\n\nstandard of care, and it will then address the expert testimony concerning the stage of the cancer\n\nat that point. See Flores-Hernandez v. United States, 910 F. Supp. 2d at 77–78 (stating that\n\n“[t]he question is not solely whether [the plaintiff] already had cancer” at the time of the alleged\n\nnegligence, but whether if the physician had complied with the national standard of care, “the\n\ncourse of treatment she received would have led to the treatment and eradication of her condition\n\nsooner, before it advanced to Stage IVA”).\n\n                       a) Reevaluation of the Plaintiff Within Thirty to Sixty Days of The\n                          December 3, 2009 visit Would Likely Have Resulted in Diagnosis of\n                          Her Cancer Between January and July 2010.\n\n       As already pointed out, the defendant presented no expert opinion that would dispute the\n\nplaintiff’s position that her cancer would have been diagnosed earlier had Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nsatisfied the standard of care at the December 3, 2009 visit. While conceding this point, the\n\ndefendant relies upon the testimony of its expert Dr. Feigert that by December 2009, the\n\nplaintiff’s cancer was already at such an advanced stage that it would have been incurable no\n\nmatter what Dr. Hill-Daniel had done at that appointment. Nonetheless, since the plaintiff bears\n\nthe burden of proof on all aspects of her claim, the Court must still assess the sufficiency of the\n\nplaintiff’s evidence on this question, and the Court finds that the evidence demonstrates to a\n\nreasonable degree of medical certainty that had Dr. Hill-Daniel scheduled an appointment for the\n\nplaintiff to return for re-evaluation of her breast complaints within thirty to sixty days after\n\nDecember 3, 2009, the plaintiff’s cancer would have been diagnosed sometime between January\n\nand July 2010.\n\n\n                                                      93\n\f       First, it is clear to the Court that had Dr. Hill-Daniel not told the plaintiff at the December\n\n3, 2009 visit that her breast concerns were benign, but instead scheduled a follow-up\n\nappointment for the plaintiff in order to rule out the possibility of breast cancer, the plaintiff\n\nwould have attended the follow-up appointment and reported that the knot in her breast was still\n\npresent. The evidence at trial showed that the plaintiff attended every scheduled appointment\n\nwith her health care providers concerning her breast complaints. Moreover, the plaintiff raised\n\nthe concern about her breast in the first instance, and she obviously thought it was important\n\nenough to schedule and attend the initial visit, so the Court has no doubt that she would have\n\nattended the follow-up visit. In addition, the plaintiff testified that in January 2010, the knot in\n\nher left breast remained about the same as it had been in December. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at\n\n20:5–:9 (“Q: And the lumps in your breasts were still there; is that correct? A: The knot in my\n\nleft breast? Q: Were still there; isn’t that correct? Q: Yeah. It was about the same.”). Even by\n\nApril 30, 2010, the knot in her left breast had not changed. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 83:24–:25\n\n(“Q: Was the knot still present? A: It was the same thing as from the first visit in 2009.”).\n\n       In addition, Dr. Sutherland testified that if Dr. Hill-Daniel had conducted another breast\n\nexamination thirty to sixty days after the December 3, 2009 appointment, Dr. Hill-Daniel would\n\nhave felt the mass in the plaintiff’s left breast. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 50:10–:11 (“[M]y opinion\n\nis that Dr. Hill-Daniel would have felt the mass at that point[.]”); see also Trial Tr. ECF No. 70\n\nat 78:10–:13 (Dr. Margo’s testimony that Dr. Hill-Daniel “well may have felt something\n\n[abnormal in the plaintiff’s left breast] in January and/or April [2010]” given the outcome). The\n\nopinion of Dr. Feigert, the defendant’s expert, that by that time the plaintiff’s cancer was already\n\nStage III-B or Stage IV, only bolsters the credibility of Dr. Sutherland’s opinion that the knot\n\nwould have been palpable to Dr. Hill-Daniel in January or February of 2010.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      94\n\f       Regardless of whether Dr. Hill-Daniel would have felt the knot at the follow-up visit, the\n\nnational standard of care would have required Dr. Hill-Daniel to order a diagnostic ultrasound\n\nmerely on the grounds that the plaintiff’s symptoms had not changed with her menstrual cycle.\n\nId. at 77:4–:7 (Dr. Margo’s testimony that the reason that the patient should be followed up in\n\nfour to six weeks is to check whether the symptoms are actually cyclical in nature even if the\n\npatient told the physician that they were not cyclical because “sometimes people aren’t aware\n\nthat there’s a cyclical nature, even if there is, so that by waiting for another period, you can take\n\nthat into account as well”); Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 46:22–47:23 (Dr. Sutherland’s testimony that\n\nwhen a nonlactating woman presents with noncyclic breast pain, the national standard of care for\n\na family medicine doctor requires referral for diagnostic imaging).\n\n       The plaintiff presented adequate expert testimony that diagnostic imaging would have\n\nuncovered plaintiff’s cancer at that stage. Id. at 47:23–48:5 (Dr. Sutherland’s testimony that if\n\ndiagnostic imaging had been ordered at the December 3, 2009 visit, it is more likely than not that\n\nan ultrasound would have revealed a suspicious mass in the left breast). The defendant presented\n\nno evidence that disputed that opinion and, again, Dr. Feigert’s opinion that the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nwas already Stage III-B or Stage IV by that point supports Dr. Sutherland’s testimony that the\n\ncancer would have been visible on a diagnostic imaging test, such as an ultrasound.\n\n       Finally, it is likely that if Dr. Hill-Daniel had satisfied the national standard of care by\n\ncommunicating to the plaintiff the importance of the test and the appropriate timeframe for\n\nscheduling those tests, as well as encouraging, rather than impeding, her ability to have the tests\n\nperformed when scheduled, the plaintiff’s diagnostic process would have proceeded from\n\nultrasound referral to ultimate diagnosis in less time than the five months it eventually took. If\n\nultrasound referral to ultimate diagnosis had taken the mere two to three weeks that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     95\n\fplaintiff’s experts Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Margo testified that it should have taken, the plaintiff’s\n\ncancer would have been diagnosed sometime between January 18, 2010 (thirty days from\n\nDecember 3, 2009 plus an additional two weeks for diagnosis) and February 22, 2010 (sixty days\n\nfrom December 3, 2009 plus an additional three weeks for diagnosis). Even if it had taken five\n\nmonths to proceed from the ultrasound referral to the ultimate diagnosis, the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nwould have been diagnosed by July 1, 2010 (sixty days after December 3, 2009 plus an\n\nadditional five months for diagnosis).\n\n        Using the most conservative estimate, the Court concludes that plaintiff’s expert\n\ntestimony showed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that had Dr. Hill-Daniel satisfied\n\nthe national standard of care by scheduling a follow-up visit for the plaintiff thirty to sixty days\n\nafter December 3, 2009, the plaintiff’s breast cancer would have been diagnosed before July\n\n2010.\n\n                       b) The Plaintiff’s Cancer was Stage I Until Sometime Before July 2010 at\n                          the Earliest, When it Progressed to Stage II.\n\n        The Court must next determine whether the plaintiff’s expert testimony showed, to a\n\nreasonable degree of medical certainty, that her cancer would have been less advanced than\n\nStage IV if it had been diagnosed before July 1, 2010. At the outset, the parties do not dispute\n\nthat the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis is the best predictor of prognosis. See Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 55 at 21:24–22:1 (Dr. Tucker); see also 3rd FOF Table ¶ 345–46 (listing as “not disputed”\n\nthe facts: (1) “Most of the outcome of breast cancer is determined by the AJCC stage,” and\n\n(2) “[AJCC] stage is the single most important predictor of outcome”). The experts in this case\n\npresented two completely divergent opinions on the issue of the staging of the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nin December 2009 and in the few months following that visit. Specifically, the plaintiff’s\n\nexperts, Dr. Tucker and Dr. Pushkas, testified that the plaintiff’s breast cancer was Stage I at the\n\n\n\n                                                     96\n\fDecember 3, 2009 visit and remained Stage I until at least July 2010. The defendant’s expert,\n\nDr. Fiegert, testified that the plaintiff’s breast cancer was already Stage III-B – meaning it had\n\ninvaded her skin – or even more likely Stage IV – meaning that the distant metastasis beyond the\n\nbreast was widespread – at the time of her December 2009 visit. The Court finds the opinions of\n\nplaintiff’s expert Dr. Tucker to be entirely persuasive, and corroborated by Dr. Pushkas. 20\n\n         Dr. Tucker’s opinions about the progression of the plaintiff’s cancer are supported in\n\nseveral ways. First, his opinions are straightforward and consistent. As a general matter, he\n\nfounded his opinions in the scientific and medical literature, and did not overstate the\n\nconclusiveness of new and untested scientific conclusions. For example, he testified on direct\n\nexamination that cancers have a relatively uniform growth rate, but that the growth rate may\n\nincrease as a small tumor gets larger, especially as the tumor becomes metastatic. Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 55 at 31:22–32:4. This influenced his conclusion that the growth rate of the plaintiff’s\n\ncancer may have increased over time. Id. at 64:1–:6. At the same time, he acknowledged that\n\nthe variations were relatively small and that to try to determine how the growth rate of a\n\nparticular tumor might change “would be conjecture.” Id. at 32:1–:4. As a result, he used the\n\nmore conservative linear growth rate to extrapolate the size of the plaintiff’s tumor in December\n\n2009 from measurements that were taken in 2011. Id. at 34:13–:21, 36:3–:8 (“[T]his would be a\n\nlinear scale proportionate linear scale on calendar days from this point on.”). During cross-\n\nexamination, Dr. Tucker was steady and consistent, as illustrated by the following unsuccessful\n\nattempt by defense counsel to impeach him:\n\n                Q: . . . You have testified during your deposition and stated in your report\n         not only that Ms. Rhodes’ cancer was growing very rapidly between December\n\n\n20\n  Although both Dr. Tucker and Dr. Pushkas testified that the plaintiff had Stage I breast cancer in December 2009,\nand that it did not progress to Stage II until July 2010, at the earliest, the Court will rely on the expert opinion of Dr.\nTucker because he provided a more comprehensive foundation for his opinions.\n\n\n                                                                 97\n\f       2009 and the time of the diagnosis in March 2011, but that the growth rate was\n       accelerating, correct?\n               A: More likely than not, it probably was accelerating, yes.\n               Q: And you have stated that the cancer started out as a low grade cancer,\n       but that it transformed into a higher grade cancer over time, correct?\n               A: No, that is a mischaracterization of my deposition testimony. I never\n       said that it was a low grade cancer. My deposition testimony was that it may have\n       been a lower grade at some point in time, but I don’t believe that it was ever a low\n       grade cancer. We just don’t see that.\n\nId. at 64:1–:14. Moreover, Dr. Tucker grounded his opinion in the scientific literature: he cited\n\nan article from the American Journal of Roentgenology, which – despite defense counsel’s\n\nskepticism, id. at 65:25–69:6, – appears to the Court to support his conclusions. Pl.’s Ex. 52, at\n\nD-46 (table summarizing the histological grade of cancer by size and pattern).\n\n       What most distinguishes Dr. Tucker’s and Dr. Feigert’s opinions regarding the stage of\n\nthe plaintiff’s cancer in December 2009, is that Dr. Tucker’s opinion corresponds with the\n\nmedical evidence that was presented at trial, whereas Dr. Feigert’s opinion simply does not. Cf.\n\nFlores-Hernandez, 910 F. Supp. 2d 64, 79 (finding expert witness’s opinions to be not credible\n\nin part because they were inconsistent with the medical evidence presented at trial). First, it is\n\nundisputed that by the end of March 2011, the cancer had metastasized to approximately eight\n\nbony sites in the plaintiff’s right shoulder and left scapula, which, Dr. Tucker testified, is\n\nrelatively few for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 50:2–:13; see\n\nalso Pl.’s Ex. 8 at 8097; 3rd FOF Table ¶ 374. There was no evidence of visceral involvement,\n\nmeaning involvement of the brain, lungs, liver, or other body sites. Id. at 50:14–:15. In addition,\n\nthe report from the May 12, 2011 MRI of the plaintiff’s pelvis notes that the results were\n\n“suspicious for early bone metastatic disease.” Pl.’s Ex. 21 at 1. The radiologist who read the\n\nMRI and wrote the report, Dr. Bowers, testified at trial that the lesions on the pelvis were not\n\nvisible on the March 2011 CT scan and bone scan, which had been taken just two months earlier.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      98\n\fTrial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 54:3–:18. He testified that in his experience, these circumstances\n\ndemonstrate that the metastasis had been present for less than a year and probably less than six\n\nmonths. 21\n\n         Second, the defendant produced no evidence that the plaintiff had any physical\n\nmanifestations of metastases until October 18, 2010, when Dr. Hill-Daniel palpated possible\n\nlymph node involvement, despite the fact that multiple medical providers examined her breast\n\ncomplaints between December 2009 and October 2010. A brief review of this evidence,\n\nincluding the testimony of the plaintiff’s actual treating physicians and their documented\n\nobservations of the plaintiff’s condition in her medical records, demonstrate the purely\n\nspeculative and unsupported nature of Dr. Feigert’s opinion.\n\n         Multiple experts, including the defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified that the spread of\n\ncancer to the lymph nodes is often detected by palpation of lymph nodes in the axilla, or armpit.\n\nSee Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 58:19–:22 (plaintiff’s expert Dr. Margo’s testimony that if a\n\nphysician feels a lymph node, it is worrisome because it can indicate lymph node involvement);\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 24:22–:25 (defendant’s expert Dr. Bethea testifying that “no\n\nlympdenopathy” – or no palpable lymph nodes – “says there’s no evidence of cancer that has\n\nspread to the axilla. That’s one of the areas or sites of spread of cancer.”); Trial Tr. ECF No. 56\n\nat 75:4–:5 (plaintiff’s expert Dr. Pushkas testifying that “palpable lymph nodes are more likely to\n\nbe involved than non-palpable lymph nodes”). Yet, the first physical evidence of lymph node\n\ninvolvement is Dr. Hill-Daniel’s notation in the progress note for the plaintiff’s October 18, 2011\n\nvisit: “palpable LN in L Axilla.” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1024.\n\n\n\n\n21\n  The Court notes, however, that it is not entirely clear whether this statement referred to the plaintiff’s metastatic\ndisease generally or only to the two metastasis sites in her pelvis. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 56:1–:11.\n\n\n                                                                99\n\f        Similarly, plaintiff’s expert Dr. Pushkas testified that metastasis to the skin often has\n\nvisible signs. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 80:21–81:2 (Dr. Pushkas’s testimony that skin\n\ninvolvement is “usually visible” and can look like ulcerations or nodules on the skin or can\n\nsometimes make the skin look like the skin of an orange”). Even Dr. Feigert testified that while\n\nmicroscopic involvement of the skin might not show any changes to the surface of the skin, gross\n\ninfiltration can cause thickening or hardening or nodules on the skin. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at\n\n39:12–:19. Yet, at the plaintiff’s December 3, 2009 visit to Unity, Dr. Hill-Daniel detected no\n\npalpable lymph nodes and no evidence of discoloration or hardening of the skin. Moreover, Dr.\n\nCarter, who examined the plaintiff at Howard University Hospital in May, 2010, did not make\n\nany notations about palpable lymph nodes or abnormalities in the skin despite making thorough\n\nnotations about the nodules he palpated in the plaintiff’s breasts. See Pl.’s Ex. 104. Likewise,\n\nthe healthcare provider who examined the plaintiff at Fort Washington Hospital on August 9,\n\n2010, did not note any palpable lymph nodes or lesions. While the defendant asserts that there is\n\npurportedly a note on the Fort Washington Medical Center record that there were “lesions”\n\npresent on the plaintiff’s breast, 3rd FOF Table ¶ 432(B), no such notation is apparent on the\n\nrecord that was admitted into evidence. Pl.’s Ex. 6. In fact, the record of the visit contains a\n\nprinted portion that says, “Return to the ER if you feel worse or if you have any problems. You\n\nshould especially return if you develop any of the symptoms circled below.” Pl.’s Ex. 6, at 6004.\n\nTwo of the options were “worse redness” and “worse swelling,” but the provider circled only\n\n“redness” and “swelling,” and excluded the word “worse,” suggesting that the plaintiff did not\n\nhave those symptoms at the time of her visit. Id. The provider also wrote “skin ulceration”\n\nunder the list of symptoms that should trigger a return visit, suggesting that he or she detected no\n\nsigns of skin infiltration. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     100\n\f         Finally, the plaintiff’s treating oncologist, Dr. Yoo, testified that the plaintiff’s bony\n\nmetastases have caused her acute pain at the metastasis sites. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 46:3–:8,\n\n47:14–:18, 50:2–:25, 51:14–52:13. Even Dr. Feigert agreed that “maybe other patients don’t\n\nhave painful bony metastatic disease, but we know the plaintiff does.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at\n\n90:22–:24 (“Sadly she does, that’s correct.”). Yet, for the ten month period between December\n\n2009 and October 2010, no medical record for the plaintiff documents any complaint about bone\n\npains, undermining Dr. Feigert’s opinion that her cancer had already metastasized to such an\n\nextent as Stage IV. 22\n\n         In an apparent effort to get around the lack of any medical evidence supporting his\n\nopinion, Dr. Feigert testified that in December 2009, the metastases might have been only a\n\nsingle malignant cell that had spread to the skin or bones, and that such a small-scale spread\n\nwould not necessarily cause symptoms. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 95:13–:21. He did not\n\nadequately explain, however, why the plaintiff had no symptoms associated with a metastatic\n\nbreast cancer for the next ten months. 23\n\n\n\n\n22\n  In addition, Dr. Feigert’s opinion that the plaintiff’s cancer had already spread to her skin by December 2009 was\nbased primarily on what he described as the extensive infiltration of the breast cancer to the plaintiff’s skin ten\nmonths later, in October 2010. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 31:15–:18. That description, however, is simply not\nsupported by the record. No reference to “discoloration” of the breast is contained in the progress note for the\nplaintiff’s October 18, 2010 appointment, Pl.’s Ex. 1 at 1024; Def.’s Ex. 1 at 12, despite Dr. Hill-Daniel’s\nrecollection during her testimony that the “first thing [she] noticed” at the plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 appointment\nwas that she had a discoloration over the left breast. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 27:10–:12. The only notation in the\nprogress note that might suggest skin involvement states “multiple scars on L breast some overlying nodules,” but\nneither party provided testimony about the meaning of this notation, and whatever Dr. Hill-Daniel observed did not\nprompt her to the conclusion that the plaintiff had such advanced breast cancer that it had progressed to “extensive\ninfiltration” of the skin. The Court also notes that the defendant’s assertion in the FOF Table that “[i]n October of\n2010, Dr. Hill-Daniel is able to palpate ‘obvious evidence of gross skin infiltration’ on Ms. Rhodes’ skin and she\ndescribes it in her October 2010 note” is misleading as those words – “obvious evidence of gross skin infiltration” –\nare not written or described in the progress note for the October 18, 2010 visit. See 3rd FOF Table ¶ 430(B).\n23\n  Perhaps Dr. Feigert expected the Court to find his opinion more credible, despite the lack of corroborating medical\nevidence in the plaintiff’s medical records, in light of his view that her cancer had a slow to average growth rate.\nFor the reasons that will be explained below, the Court also does not find his views on the growth rate of the cancer\nto be persuasive.\n\n\n                                                             101\n\f       The Court is satisfied that Dr. Tucker provided a sufficient scientific and medical\n\nfoundation for his opinion that the plaintiff’s breast cancer was Stage I between December 2009\n\nand July 2010. He estimated the size of the plaintiff’s tumor by extrapolating from the size as\n\nmeasured in three different studies – an ultrasound, CT scan, and PET CT scan – and a linear\n\ngrowth rate, which both parties agree best characterizes the way that cancer tumors grow, 3rd\n\nFOF Table ¶ 354. He further testified that the conclusion he reached about the small size of the\n\ntumor in December 2009 was consistent with the high growth rate of the cancer, as illustrated by\n\nthe high grade on the AJCC-endorsed Nottingham grading system that the radiologist who read\n\nthe plaintiff’s ultrasound report assessed it to have. His opinion that the plaintiff had no nodal\n\ninvolvement or distant metastases on December 3, 2009, was based on the evidence that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel did not palpate any lymph nodes at the December 3, 2009 visit or see any evidence of\n\nspreading to the skin, and that the plaintiff did not complain of any symptoms that are associated\n\nwith lymph node or distant metastasis. No physical evidence of lymph node involvement is\n\ncorroborated by the low probability of lymph node involvement with a one centimeter tumor.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 44:24–45:1 (“85 percent of patients even with a high grade one\n\ncentimeter invasive duct cancer, don’t have lymph node metastases.”).\n\n       Defendant unconvincingly challenges the scientific foundation for this opinion by\n\nattacking Dr. Tucker’s method of estimating the cancer’s growth rate. To determine relative\n\ngrowth rate, Dr. Tucker relied on the tumor’s overall histological grade on the AJCC-endorsed\n\nNottingham grading system. According to Dr. Tucker, the fact that the plaintiff’s cancer has the\n\nhighest Nottingham grade of 3 indicates that it is a fast growing cancer. Dr. Feigert, on the other\n\nhand, testified that while the overall Nottingham grade conveys the “aggressiveness” of the\n\ncancer, which he defined as the potential to invade the blood stream and spread into the body,\n\n\n\n\n                                                    102\n\fTrial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 48:12–:18, the growth rate is controlled by one particular component of\n\nthe grade: the mitotic rate, which is the number of cells dividing at one point in time. Id. at\n\n48:7–:8. According to Dr. Feigert, while the high Nottingham grade of the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nshowed that it was aggressive, its mitotic rate score of 2 out of a potential score of 3 indicated\n\nthat it does not have a particularly high growth rate. Id. at 46:12–:15, 46:22–47:14. Dr. Feigert\n\ncited the low expression of a substance called Ki-67 in the plaintiff’s cancer cells, which is a\n\nmeasure of the cancer cells’ expression of synthesizing DNA, as suggesting that its growth rate\n\nwas slow to average. Id. at 51:8–:19.\n\n       By contrast to Dr. Feigert’s reliance on mitotic rate, Dr. Tucker provided a convincing\n\nscientific argument for why mitotic rate alone is not an accepted way of measuring growth rate.\n\nDr. Tucker explained that many cancer cells may have defective DNA, so despite the appearance\n\nof many cells dividing, not many will survive. Thus, even if the mitotic rate is elevated, that\n\nmight not correspond to tumor growth directly. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 61:10–:23. Dr. Tucker’s\n\ntestimony was both consistent and grounded in the AJCC guidelines, which do not parse out\n\nmitotic cell division scores to evaluate a tumor’s prognosis but rely on a combination of three\n\nattributes. See id. at 25:23–:25 (“It is the combination of these three attributes together in this\n\nscoring system that has the greatest correlation with growth rate.”); id. at 58:15–:19 (“We do not\n\nuse the individual features to determine prognosis. Prognosis is solely derived from the\n\ncombined score. It is not allowed to pick out individual attributes and make judgments on\n\noutcome or growth rate or prognosis based on solitary findings.”); id. at 61:10–:12 (“[A]s I said\n\nwith the other attributes, we can’t take the individual characteristics and draw conclusions about\n\ngrowth rate from them[.]”). Even Dr. Feigert admitted that in practice, pathologists utilize the\n\noverall Nottingham grade to predict tumor growth without parsing out the individual components\n\n\n\n\n                                                     103\n\fof the system. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 78:5–:18. At one point, Dr. Feigert also admitted that the\n\ngrade reflects both the aggressiveness of the cancer and its growth potential. Id. at 78:5–:7.\n\n         Dr. Tucker also convincingly and unwaveringly testified that despite the label of Ki-67 as\n\na “proliferation marker,” Ki-67 expression is a prognostic indicator that tells doctors whether a\n\npatient would be likely to benefit from chemotherapy. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 63:12–:25. The\n\nway that many chemotherapy drugs work is by disrupting DNA synthesis, so if the cancer shows\n\na high Ki-67 expression, it is more likely that those drugs will work with that particular type of\n\ncancer. Id. Even Dr. Feigert admitted that the AJCC has rejected the incorporation of\n\nproliferation markers such as Ki-67 in its staging system, and instead relies on the Nottingham\n\ngrading system with reliance of multiple attributes to predict growth rate. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57\n\nat 76:11–78:6. Dr. Feigert did not produce any medical protocol that accepted Ki-67 expression\n\nas a reliable measure of growth rate in the manner that he was using it as a basis of his opinion. 24\n\n         It is also worth mentioning that several aspects of Dr. Feigert’s testimony cast doubt on\n\nthe reliability of his opinions. First, cross-examination revealed that Dr. Feigert submitted two\n\nvery different expert reports – one dated December 15, 2012, and a second dated February 15,\n\n2013. Id. at 74:10–:16. The first report characterized the plaintiff’s cancer as “very aggressive,”\n\ncontained no mention of Ki-67, and did not characterize the plaintiff’s cancer as slow-growing.\n\n24\n   Dr. Feigert and Dr. Tucker also disagreed about what imaging test provides the most reliable measurement of\ntumor size. The measurements that Dr. Tucker relied on were derived from ultrasound and CT scan images,\nwhereas the measurements that Dr. Feigert relied on were derived from MRI images. The CT scan images from\nMarch 24 and March 28, 2011 showed the size of the plaintiff’s tumor as 2.8 centimeters and 2.6 centimeters,\nrespectively. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 33:24–34:12. The MRI image from April 4, 2011 showed the size of the\nplaintiff’s tumor as up to 10 centimeters. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 38:8–:10, 44:3–:5; Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 44:10–\n:17. Dr. Tucker testified that MRI imaging provides a good measure of overall tumor size, but it is not used for\npurposes of grading the tumor under the AJCC system. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 38:10–:15. That is because the\nstaging system is only concerned with invasive cancer, not cancer with no potential to spread (called carcinoma in\nsitu). According to Dr. Tucker, the MRI test is not used for staging purposes because it shows both invasive cancer\nas well as carcinoma in situ. Id. at 36:13–:20. Ultrasound is the preferred method for staging purposes because\nultrasound is not as good at picking up carcinoma in situ. Id. The Court is inclined to accept Dr. Tucker’s opinion\nbecause it found his opinions generally more grounded in the plaintiff’s medical records than those of Dr. Feigert;\nhowever, it need not resolve this particular dispute because the defendant did not specifically challenge Dr. Tucker’s\nestimation of tumor size; it only disputed whether any cancer had spread beyond the left breast before July 2010.\n\n\n                                                             104\n\fId. at 74:19–75:14. Only in the second report – submitted a mere two months after the first – did\n\nDr. Feigert parse the definition of an “aggressive” cancer, and opine that the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nwas slow-growing. Id. at 75:11–:14. In addition, there were significant inconsistencies in how\n\nDr. Feigert characterized the extent of the plaintiff’s cancer in December 2009. He\n\nacknowledged at trial that his report described “extensive progression of bony metastatic disease\n\nin December of 2009.” Id. at 90:20–:21. Yet, to explain how the plaintiff remained generally\n\nfree of symptoms of metastatic cancer (e.g., no lymph node involvement, no skin involvement,\n\nand no bone pains), he testified that “it reflects the fact that many patients with metastatic breast\n\ncancer don’t have symptoms. Certainly now when it’s microscopic.” Id. at 90:16–:19. These\n\ninconsistencies trigger concern about the bases of his opinions.\n\n       The Court acknowledges that it is impossible to know with certainty the stage of the\n\nplaintiff’s cancer in December 2009 because no imaging or other testing was performed at that\n\ntime. The negligence standard does not require absolute certainty, however, but only a\n\nreasonable degree of certainty. Sponaugle v. Pre-Term, Inc., 411 A.2d 366, 367 (D.C. 1980)\n\n(“While absolute certainty is not required, opinion evidence that is conjectural or speculative is\n\nnot permitted.”). Accordingly, the Court finds, based on Dr. Tucker’s expert opinions, that\n\nplaintiff has proved the following to a reasonable degree of medical certainty:\n\n           •   On December 3, 2009, the plaintiff’s tumor was between one centimeter and one\n\n               and a half centimeters in diameter, giving her a T value of 1 on the AJCC scale.\n\n           •   On December 3, 2009, the plaintiff’ had no nodal involvement, giving her an N\n\n               value of 0 on the AJCC scale.\n\n           •   On December 3, 2009, the plaintiff had no distant metastases, giving her an M\n\n               value of 0 on the AJCC scale.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     105\n\f            •   Because a T1/N0/M0 breast cancer corresponds to Stage I on the AJCC staging\n\n                scale, the plaintiff had Stage I breast cancer on December 3, 2009.\n\n            •   The earliest that the plaintiff’ breast cancer became Stage II was July 2010.\n\n        Since the Court has already found that the plaintiff met her burden of showing by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s satisfaction of the national standard of care\n\nwould have led to a diagnosis of the plaintiff’s breast cancer by July 1, 2010 at the very latest,\n\nand the plaintiff has shown with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that her cancer still\n\nwould have been at Stage I at that point, the Court finds that plaintiff has proven that had Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel satisfied the national standard of care, it is more likely than not that the plaintiff’s\n\ncancer would have been diagnosed at Stage I.\n\n                2.      If the plaintiff’s Breast Cancer Had Been Diagnosed at Stage I, the\n                        Treatment She Would Have Received Would Likely Have Cured It.\n\n        Finally, the Court concludes that plaintiff’s evidence at trial demonstrated that had the\n\nplaintiff’s breast cancer been diagnosed at Stage I, it is more likely than not that the treatment\n\nshe would have received would have cured it. See Ferrell, 691 A.2d at 651–52 (stating that to\n\ndetermine whether the negligence was a “substantial factor” in causing the harm, a court must\n\nfind that there was a substantial possibility of survival and that the defendant destroyed it).\n\nPlaintiff’s expert Dr. Pushkas testified that overall survival for Stage I breast cancer is 98%.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 77:14–:16. His opinion is grounded in statistics from the SEER Survival\n\nMonograph for breast cancer, a compilation of over 300,000 cases reported from all over the\n\nUnited States. Id. at 63:13–:19. Defendant does not dispute Dr. Pushkas’s testimony that the\n\nSEER Survival Monograph is a reliable and authoritative source for determining the probability\n\nof survival from breast cancer in its various stages. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 390 (citing Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 56 at 63:5–:11). Moreover, Dr. Tucker testified that a Stage I lesion has a cure rate in the\n\n\n\n                                                      106\n\forder of about 80 to 85% over five years, Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 11:18–:19, and that it is\n\ntreatable for cure in a great majority of cases. Id. at 47:5–:9. Although Dr. Feigert testified that\n\nnot all patients with Stage I disease survive, he acknowledged that “most do.” Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n57 at 49:21–:23. He also testified that the plaintiff’s cancer is subtype Luminal A, which\n\ngenerally carries the highest survival rates of all forms of cancer, and that it has other biological\n\nfeatures that are characteristic of favorable prognosis. Id. at 69:1–:14. This expert testimony\n\nsatisfies the Court that had the plaintiff’s cancer been diagnosed and treated at Stage I, it is more\n\nlikely than not that it would have been cured. Since the plaintiff’s cancer was not diagnosed\n\nuntil it was Stage IV, however, all of the experts, as well as the plaintiff’s treating oncologist,\n\nagreed that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s negligence eliminated any possibility that Ms. Hill-Daniel will\n\nsurvive her disease. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:1–:2 (Dr. Tucker); Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 23:9–\n\n:16 (Dr. Yoo); 3rd FOF Table ¶ 11 (listing as “not disputed” the fact that “Stage IV breast cancer\n\nis incurable”).\n\n       Accordingly, the Court finds that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s negligence is more likely than not to\n\nhave been a proximate cause of the injuries the plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer\n\nas a result of having incurable breast cancer.\n\n       D.         Damages\n\n       In determining the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, the Court is guided\n\nby the fundamental principle underlying the “American rule on damages” as set forth in the\n\n“seminal case” of Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555 (1931).\n\nHill v. Republic of Iraq, 328 F.3d 680, 684 (D.C. Cir. 2003). In Story Parchment Co., the\n\nSupreme Court stated:\n\n       Where the tort itself is of such a nature as to preclude the ascertainment of the\n       amount of damages with certainty, it would be a perversion of fundamental\n\n\n\n                                                     107\n\f       principles of justice to deny all relief to the injured person, and thereby relieve the\n       wrong-doer from making any amend for his acts. In such case, while the damages\n       may not be determined by mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if the\n       evidence show the extent of damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference,\n       although the result be only approximate.\n\n\n282 U.S. at 562. The Supreme Court emphasized “the clear distinction” in the standard of proof\n\nnecessary to establish a plaintiff’s entitlement to damages and to assess the amount of those\n\ndamages. Id. (“[T]here is a clear distinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish\n\nthe fact that petitioner had sustained some damage, and the measure of proof necessary to enable\n\nthe jury to fix the amount”). While a plaintiff must prove entitlement to damages with\n\nreasonable certainty or preponderance of the evidence, proof of the amount of damages only\n\nrequires a reasonable estimate. See id.; see also Samaritan Inns, Inc. v. District of Columbia, 114\n\nF.3d 1227, 1235 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (plaintiff must “prove the fact of injury with reasonable\n\ncertainty, [and prove] the amount of damages . . . based on a reasonable estimate”); Wood v.\n\nDay, 859 F.2d 1490, 1493 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (plaintiff need only provide “some reasonable basis\n\non which to estimate damages”) (quoting Romer v. District of Columbia, 449 A.2d 1097, 1100\n\n(D.C. 1982)); Abraham v. Gendlin, 172 F.2d 881, 883 (D.C. Cir. 1949)(“[T]here is a clear\n\ndistinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish the fact of damage and the\n\nmeasure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix the amount.”).\n\n       Thus, the Court’s task is to “‘make a just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on\n\nrelevant data,’” United States ex rel. Miller v. Bill Harbert Int'l Constr., Inc., 608 F.3d 871, 905\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251, 264 (1946)). Such\n\nrelevant data may include “probable and inferential as well as direct . . . and positive proof.”\n\nBigelow, 327 U.S. at 264.\n\n       In setting about this task, the Court is mindful that damages “may not be determined by\n\n\n\n                                                    108\n\fmere speculation or guess . . . although the result may be only approximate.” Hill, 328 F.3d at\n\n684. Moreover, under District of Columbia law, “[a]n award of damages must . . . avoid[]\n\nextravagant awards that bear little or no relation to the actual injury involved.” Campbell-Crane\n\n& Assocs. v. Stamenkovic, 44 A.3d 924, 945 (D.C. 2012) (internal citations omitted). In other\n\nwords, the damages award “must be proportional to the harm actually suffered.” Phillips v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, 458 A.2d 722, 726 (D.C. 1983).\n\n       Finally, the D.C. Circuit has instructed that the trial court must explain the reasons for the\n\ndetermination of the damages award and tether these reasons to the record. See Eureka Inv.\n\nCorp. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 743 F.2d 932, 940 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“[I]t is essential that the trial\n\ncourt give sufficient indication of how it computed the amount so that the reviewing court can\n\ndetermine whether it is supported by the record.”) (citing Hatahley v. United States, 351 U.S.\n\n173, 182 (1956)); see also Safer v. Perper, 569 F.2d 87, 100 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“The measure of\n\ndamages and method of computation [must] be exposed so as to inform the litigants and afford a\n\npossibility of intelligent review.”). The Court now turns to this important task.\n\n       The plaintiff has requested both economic and noneconomic damages in five distinct\n\ncategories: past medical expenses, future care costs, future lost earnings, loss of household\n\nservices, and pain and suffering. See Pl.’s Concls. at 46–47. At the outset, the Court finds that\n\nthe plaintiff has proven she is entitled to damages in all five categories. “[A] plaintiff may\n\nrecover damages for past economic losses if such losses are ‘reasonably proved,’ while a\n\nplaintiff may recover for future harm only by a reasonable certainty or preponderance of the\n\nevidence.” Hill, 328 F. 3d at 684. In this case, the plaintiff has “reasonably proved” that her past\n\nmedical expenses have been incurred as a result of the defendant’s negligence.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    109\n\f       The other four categories of damages address future costs. When damages are sought for\n\nthe “future consequences of a tort, damages are available only if such consequences are\n\nreasonably certain.” Wood v. Day, 859 F.2d 1490, 1493 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (internal citation\n\nomitted); see also Hill, 328 F. 3d at 684; Green v. United States Postal Serv., 589 F. Supp. 2d 58,\n\n69 (D.D.C. 2008). The District of Columbia views “reasonably certain” consequences to be\n\nthose where “it is more likely than not (a greater than 50% chance) that the projected\n\nconsequence will occur.” Moattar v. Foxhall Surgical Assocs., 694 A.2d 435, 439 (D.C. 1997)\n\n(quoting Wilson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 684 F.2d 111, 119 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). The parties\n\ndo not dispute that the plaintiff will continue to need substantial medical care. Def.’s Ex. 36 at\n\n30:11–:17 (“I used . . . the number of years that Ms. Patterson estimated . . . and she said that Ms.\n\nRhodes would need one and a half years of future care costs.”); Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10 (projecting\n\ncosts for future care through the end of the plaintiff’s life). It is equally beyond dispute that the\n\nplaintiff will suffer some amount of lost wages, incur costs through the loss of household\n\nservices, and incur non-economic damages for pain and suffering. Thus, each of the future costs\n\nis “reasonably certain” to occur. Therefore, the only issue before the Court is the amount of\n\ndamages to award for these future costs.\n\n       The Court explains below the basis for its ruling on the amount of damages in each of\n\nthese categories.\n\n               1.      Past Medical Expenses\n\n       The parties have stipulated that the plaintiff’s medical bills included in the plaintiff’s\n\nExhibit 31, totaling $33,285.17, “are fair and reasonable and that they are related to medical\n\nservices that were made necessary as a result of the evolution of Miss Rhodes’ cancer into stage\n\nIV.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 8:22–9:11. This amount apparently excludes those medical\n\n\n\n\n                                                     110\n\fexpenses, which had originally been part of the plaintiff’s claim for past medical expenses but\n\nthe parties agreed were “not properly recoverable.” Id. at 8:11–:13. It is axiomatic that a\n\ndefendant is only liable for those damages proximately caused by the defendant’s actions. See,\n\ne.g., Monzel, 641 F.3d at 535; cf. Graham v. Roberts, 441 F.2d 995, 997 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (in\n\ndental malpractice case in which the defendant permitted the patient’s condition to worsen\n\nprogressively by failing to refer the patient to a specialist, defendant was liable for all damages\n\nunless he introduces evidence from which a fair apportionment can be made) (citing\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS, §§ 433A, 433B, and 450 (1965), and PROSSER ON TORTS §\n\n43 (3rd ed. 1964)); Cooper v. Berzin, 621 A.2d 395, 400-401 (D.C. 1993) (“[W]here the plaintiff\n\nmet its burden to prove culpability and damages and neither party offered evidence of\n\napportionment, the plaintiff was entitled to recover fully unless the defendant offered evidence\n\nwhy he should not fairly be held responsible for all of the damages”).\n\n         Based upon the parties stipulation that the medical bills contained in exhibit 31 would not\n\nhave been incurred but for the progression of the plaintiff’s cancer to Stage IV, the Court finds\n\nthat these bills are attributable to the defendant’s negligence in the diagnosis and treatment of the\n\nplaintiff. See Trial Tr. ECF No.70 8:22–9:11. Therefore, the Court awards past medical\n\nexpenses to the plaintiff for all of these medical bills, in the total amount of $33,285.17.\n\n                  2.        Future Care Costs\n\n         Both parties’ economics experts based their opinions about the cost of the plaintiff’s\n\nfuture care at least in part on the recommendations of the plaintiff’s rehabilitation nurse expert,\n\nNurse Patterson, and the plaintiff’s social worker, Mila Tecala. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 24:5–:9;\n\nDef’s Ex. 36 at 30:11–:17. 25 Nevertheless, the estimates for future care costs differ due to\n\n\n25\n  The parties generally agree on the cost the plaintiff will incur for outpatient hospice case, (the plaintiff’s expert\nestimates $18,000 and the defendant’s expert estimates $17,516), and the cost of medical consultations (the\n\n\n                                                               111\n\fdifferences in the cost estimates for: (1) psychological services (ranging from a lower bound\n\nestimated by the defendant’s expert to be $2,932, and an upper bound estimated by the plaintiff’s\n\nexpert to be $12,814); (2) the cost of a home health aide (estimated by the defendant’s expert to\n\nbe $32,980 and by the plaintiff’s expert to be $49,680); and (3) the cost for inpatient hospice care\n\n(estimated by the defendant’s expert to be $35,032 and by the plaintiff’s expert to be $63,152).\n\nSee Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 4; Def.’s Ex. 37 at 20.\n\n         The method used by the defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, to estimate future care costs is\n\nunconvincing. For counseling and for a home health aide, Dr. Hurdle makes a fundamental error\n\nin logic. Dr. Hurdle calculated the costs for these services using the average wages for a person\n\nin the home health and counseling fields. Def.’s Ex. 37 at 16–18. By Dr. Hurdle’s logic, the\n\nplaintiff would be required to enter the employment market, hire her own counselor and home\n\nhealth aide as employees, and pay them the average hourly wage in the District of Columbia\n\n(including “legally required benefits”). See id. The Court will not require the plaintiff to\n\nbecome an employer in order to meet her health care needs. It is far more logical that the\n\nplaintiff will use a service to obtain home health care and counseling assistance, and that the\n\nservice will charge her, as a client, the market rate for this special assistance. The plaintiff’s\n\nexperts correctly calculated the costs of her future home health care and counseling service on\n\nthis basis rather than based on the amount that the services pay to their employees in wages, as\n\nthe defendant’s expert suggests. See Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 4; Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:20–:25; 95:1–\n\n:7.\n\n\n\n\nplaintiff’s expert estimates $6,240 and the defendant’s expert estimates $6,108). See Pl.’s Ex. 54, at 4; Def.’s Ex.\n37, at 18–19. The differences are accounted for by the application of slightly different inflation rates by each\nestimate. See id. The total of these additional services is $24,240 from the plaintiff’s expert’s estimate and $23, 624\nfor the defendant’s expert’s estimate. See id.\n\n\n                                                             112\n\f       The method used by the plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Lurito, to estimate the cost of a home\n\nhealth aide and individual counseling is far more realistic. He relied upon Nurse Patterson’s\n\ncalculations, which are derived from the recommendation of a counselor, who based these costs\n\non her knowledge of actual costs in this area for these services, Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:20–\n\n:22, and the expertise of Nurse Patterson, an undisputed expert in the field of nurse rehabilitation\n\nwho provides life care planning, case management and care coordination. Id. at 93:7–:19.\n\n       In estimating the cost of in-patient hospice care, Dr. Hurdle’s reasoning is, again, flawed.\n\nBy contrast to the plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Hurdle declined to accept Nurse Patterson’s cost\n\nestimate, which was based on the cost of the specific hospice facility recommended by the\n\nplaintiff’s treating physician. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:22–:25. Instead, Dr. Hurdle posited\n\nthat, if in-patient hospice care is necessary, the plaintiff “could go to a nursing home and receive\n\noutpatient hospice care at that nursing home.” Def.’s Ex. 37 at 19. She then used a private\n\ninsurance company study of the 2012 market rates in the Washington, D.C. area to determine the\n\nminimal cost for a nursing home at $200 a day. Yet, she admits in her report that the same study\n\nindicated the average cost of a nursing home in the D.C. area is more than 30 percent higher than\n\n$200 a day and she uses this average cost as the upper bound for her calculations. See id. The\n\nCourt believes in-patient hospice care means hospice care in a hospice, not in an assisted living\n\nfacility designed for another purpose.\n\n       The difference in damage amount estimates between the plaintiff’s expert and the\n\ndefendant’s expert is the difference between reality and abstraction. The Court finds that Dr.\n\nLurito’s calculations are logical and reasonable based on actual surveys and health care expertise\n\nfrom practitioners. See Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 4; Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:20–:25; 95:1–:7. Dr.\n\nHurdle’s estimates, on the other hand, are based on theoretical economics that appear focused\n\n\n\n\n                                                    113\n\fonly on yielding the lowest possible cost. Such economic theory provides limited usefulness in\n\ncompensating the plaintiff for the very real and actual cost of health care she will need in the\n\nshort amount of time she has left to live. Therefore, the Court finds the plaintiff’s expert’s\n\nestimates of future health care costs to be reliably based on actual costs for the requisite services\n\nin this area, and awards $149,886 for this component of the damages award.\n\n               3.      Future Lost Earnings\n\n       The economics experts in this case developed widely divergent numbers when estimating\n\nthe value of the plaintiff’s future lost earnings. The estimate from the plaintiff’s expert, Dr.\n\nLurito, is $737,715, Trial Tr., ECF No. 71 at 15:22–:23, and the estimate from the defendant’s\n\nexpert, Dr. Hurdle, ranges from $106,020 to $129,219. Def.’s Ex. 37 at 20. The discrepancy in\n\nthe numbers results from three major differences in the two experts’ calculations: (1) the\n\ndeduction of “consumption” expenses, (2) the difference in discount rates, and (3) the difference\n\nin the estimated number of years the plaintiff would be expected to work. The Court discusses\n\neach of these differences below.\n\n                       a) Consumption Expenses\n\n       Consumption expenses account for the “things that [the plaintiff] personally would be\n\nusing, such as food, clothing, her own personal entertainment, her own personal health insurance\n\nor life insurance, things that are just related to her own personal expenditures that no longer\n\nwould be needed if she . . . had passed away.” Def.’s Ex. 36 at 15:22–25; 16:1–3. Dr. Hurdle\n\ndeducted these consumption expenses from the wages the plaintiff could be expected to earn. Id.\n\nat 15:9–12. Dr. Lurito did not. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 19:22. Dr. Lurito bluntly explained that\n\nhis reason for not deducting consumption expenses was “[b]ecause Miss Rhodes is not dead.”\n\nId. at 19:24. That explanation is correct under District of Columbia law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     114\n\f       Lost wages “represent[] the amount that the injured party would have earned but for the\n\ninjury.” Moattar, 694 A.2d at 438 (quoting District of Columbia v. Barriteau, 399 A.2d 563,\n\n567 n.6 (D.C. 1979)). “The allowance for such recovery is consonant with the principal purpose\n\nfor compensatory damages in such cases, which is to make the victim whole.” Id. Consumption\n\nor personal maintenance expenses are typically deducted in wrongful death actions where “the\n\namount the deceased would have required to maintain himself” is deducted from a lost wages\n\nclaim. See Runyon v. District of Columbia, 463 F.2d 1319, 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1972); Baker v.\n\nSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahirya, 775 F. Supp. 2d 48, 79 (D.D.C. 2011) (deducting\n\npersonal maintenance expenses from lost wages in wrongful death action); Burton v. United\n\nStates, 668 F. Supp. 2d 86, 111-12 (D.D.C. 2009) (same); Hughes v. Pender, 391 A.2d 259, 262\n\n(D.C. 1978) (same). These deductions are made because the money the deceased would have\n\nspent on personal maintenance during her lifetime “would not have been available to her estate.”\n\nBaker, 775 F. Supp. 2d at 79. This consideration simply does not come into play outside the\n\ncontext of a wrongful death action.\n\n       In a personal injury action, the party suing is the actual party injured and the recovery\n\nwill go to her. Thus, it makes no sense to deduct the plaintiff’s own consumption costs from her\n\naward, as she is the one who will be using the lost wages for maintenance of herself. The\n\nSupreme Court acknowledged this fundamental difference in Jones and Laughlin Steel\n\nCorporation v. Pfeifer, 462 U.S. 523 (1983). In that case, the Supreme Court noted that lost\n\nwages are “intended to compensate the worker for the diminution” of her income stream. Id. at\n\n533. The Court pointed out that one difference between the lost wages awarded in a personal\n\ninjury action and those awarded in a wrongful death action is that the former benefits the injured\n\nparty while the latter benefits the injured party’s heirs. See id. at 533 n.8.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     115\n\f       In urging the Court to accept her analysis, the defendant’s expert noted that she used the\n\nmethodology of deducting consumption expenses in an estimate she prepared for the special\n\nmaster for distribution of the 9/11 Victim’s Fund. Def.’s Ex. 36, 17:6–:11. In that context, Dr.\n\nHurdle admits, however, that “the people that I was doing it for were already dead.” Id. at\n\n40:14–:16. Significantly, Dr. Hurdle testified that she has never deducted personal consumption\n\nexpenses before in a personal injury case. Id. at 41:15–:18 (“[P]ersonal consumption is only\n\ndeducted in a case where the person . . . whose income we are projecting is dead and not using\n\nthat portion of her income for her own benefit.”).\n\n       Nevertheless, the defendant persists in urging Dr. Hurdle’s deduction of personal\n\nconsumption from the lost wages award in this personal injury case. The defendant relies on\n\npure dictum in a footnote in George Washington University v. Waas, 648 A.2d 178, 182 n.7\n\n(D.C. 1994), where the District of Columbia Court of Appeals briefly mentioned that an expert in\n\nthat case calculated the lost wages of a living victim with “an increase of 7% annually to account\n\nfor inflation, promotions and productive growth, and a reduction for state and federal taxes and\n\npersonal maintenance.” Def.’s Concls. at 21. No other analysis was offered in Waas regarding\n\nwhy the personal maintenance was deducted, under what circumstances such a deduction would\n\nbe appropriate, or why it mattered for the resolution of that case. Indeed, the computation of\n\ndamages was apparently not an issue before the court, which focused instead on whether the trial\n\ncourt appropriately gave a contributory negligence jury instruction to the jury. Waas, 648 A.2d\n\nat 179. This Court declines to give any weight to this dictum.\n\n       In any event, Waas predates Moattar v. Foxhall Surgical Associates, 694 A.2d 435 (D.C.\n\n1997), where the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that, in a personal injury action,\n\nunlike in a wrongful death action, the appropriate measure of future economic damages is “the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     116\n\famount that the injured party would have earned but for the injury.” Moattar, 694 A.2d at 438.\n\nAt issue in Moattar was whether it was appropriate for a jury to consider the wages a plaintiff\n\nwould have earned had her life expectancy not been substantially shortened by the defendant\n\nphysician’s negligence. 26 Id. The court held that loss of future wages in a personal injury action\n\nis “not a premature attempt to recover wrongful death and survival damages . . . but an element\n\nof damages recoverably by the injured party during her lifetime,” even when the plaintiff’s\n\nimminent death was predicted. Id. at 437–38 (emphasis in original).\n\n         The defendant’s precise argument—that lost future income in a personal injury case\n\nshould be treated the same as it is treated in wrongful death actions—was clearly rejected by the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals in Moattar. Indeed, not even the dissent in Moattar\n\nagreed with the defendant’s argument, but instead expressly noted that damages for lost future\n\nwages “serve different purposes and are measured differently” when awarded to the living victim\n\non a personal injury claim than when awarded to survivors in a wrongful death claim. Id. at 444\n\nn.5 (King, J. dissenting). One difference in the measurement identified by the dissent is that\n\n“[p]ost-death economic damages represent the sum that would accrue to the estate,” and\n\n“[b]ecause the deceased has no living expenses,” those personal consumption expenses “must be\n\nsubtracted from the income determined to be lost.” Id. In short, the legal support in this\n\njurisdiction for the defendant’s proposed method of deducting consumption expenses from the\n\ndamages awarded for future lost wages on a personal injury action involving a plaintiff with a\n\n\n\n\n26\n   Expert testimony in Moattar indicated it was “more likely than not” that the plaintiff would die within four years\nof trial due to the delayed diagnosis of her breast cancer attributable to the defendant’s negligence. See Moattar,\n694 A.2d at 436–37.\n\n\n                                                             117\n\fshortened life span due to the defendant’s negligence, just as such expenses are deducted in\n\nwrongful death actions, is sparse to nonexistent. 27\n\n        The Court rejects the defense expert’s suggested consumption deduction. While such a\n\ndeduction has been applied in wrongful death actions, it is not appropriate in a personal injury\n\naction to deduct an amount to reflect the plaintiff’s personal consumption from the damages\n\nawarded for future lost wages.\n\n                          b) Discount Rates\n\n        The parties’ experts also dispute the discount rate that should apply to the plaintiff’s\n\naward. The discount rate is the amount an award is reduced to account for the investment\n\nincome an individual may make upon receipt of a lump sum award. See Dugar v. Wash. Metro\n\nArea Transit Auth., 565 F. Supp. 2d 120, 126 n.11 (D.D.C. 2008) (explaining that the amount\n\nthat the injured party would have earned but for the injury “must be reduced to [its] present\n\nvalue, using a valid discount rate” to produce “the present value of the loss of future earnings”)\n\n(quoting District of Columbia v. Barriteau, 399 A.2d 563, 567 n.6 (D.C. 1979)). The plaintiff’s\n\nexpert, Dr. Lurito, used a discount rate of 3.5 percent, which he considered to be “high in today’s\n\nmarket.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 17:19–:21. He based his analysis on the amount of interest\n\nthat could be earned from investing the lump sum in United States government bonds, which,\n\naccording to Dr. Lurito, are yielding between 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent, based on the bond’s\n\nmaturity date. Id. at 18:20–:25.\n\n\n27\n  The defendant also cites Doe v. United States, 737 F. Supp. 155 (D.R.I. 1990), for the proposition that\nconsumption must be deducted from estimates of lost wages in a personal injury action. Reliance on this case is\nmisplaced, however, for at least two reasons. First, the court in Doe was applying Rhode Island law, which makes\nthis case from outside this jurisdiction inapplicable. See Doe, 737 F. Supp. at 162 (applying Rhode Island law to\ndamages calculation). Second, the court in Doe adopted the government’s argument that, under the circumstances at\nissue in that case, the personal injury action was “more analogous to a wrongful death action in which deductions\nare made for the living expenses a decedent would have incurred” because of the plaintiff’s imminent death. See id.\nat 164. The defendant in this case has never made or even suggested an argument here that this case should be\nconverted into and treated as a wrongful death action. The Court therefore finds Doe unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                                           118\n\f        The defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, used an 8.98 percent discount rate, which\n\napproximately reflects the rate at which a person would be able to receive a credit card loan.\n\nDef.’s Ex. 36, at 20:5–:24; 21:14–:16. In Dr. Hurdle’s opinion, the higher discount rate “reflects\n\nthe riskiness of the future earnings that the plaintiff would have but for this injury.” Def. Ex. 36\n\nat 18:16–:18. Dr. Hurdle indicated that a discount rate that incorporates considerations of risk is\n\nused in the commercial context, because in determining what profit a company would have\n\nmade, “[i]t is pretty common now, I think, with respect to lost profit cases to consider the\n\nriskiness of the firm that is losing their profits.” Id. at 19:22–:25.\n\n        Dr. Hurdle did not testify that she had used this form of discount rate in any other\n\npersonal injury suit. Nor did the defendant point to a single personal injury case which used this\n\nmethod of essentially bumping-up the discount rate to account for risk. Indeed, in support of Dr.\n\nHurdle’s novel theory, the defendant cites only a single case from outside this jurisdiction that,\n\nironically, declined to incorporate risk into the discount rate. See O’Shea v. Riverway Towing\n\nCo., 677 F.2d 1194, 1201 (7th Cir. 1982) (upholding jury award where damages were calculated\n\nusing only inflation rate and real interest rate with no additional discount for risk).\n\n        The Supreme Court has been clear as to how the discount rate should be determined,\n\nstating: “The discount rate should be based on the rate of interest that would be earned on ‘the\n\nbest and safest investments.’” Pfeifer, 462 U.S. at 537 (quoting Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v.\n\nKelly, 241 U.S. 485, 491 (1916)). Courts both in and outside this jurisdiction have used the\n\nPfeifer standard to calculate net after tax discount rates in personal injury awards. See United\n\nStates v. Williams, No. 09-0026, 2013 WL 2285165, at *5 (D.D.C. May 24, 2013) (applying 7\n\npercent discount rate but noting it was “relatively high”); Calva-Cerqueira v. United States, 281\n\nF. Supp. 2d 279, 296-98 (D.D.C. 2003) (following Pfeiffer standard and using a 4.5 percent\n\n\n\n\n                                                      119\n\fdiscount rate); see also Ammar v. United States, 342 F.3d 133, 147 (2d Cir. 2003) (stating “the\n\ndiscount rate should reflect only the time value of the money” and noting a default discount rate\n\nof two percent is appropriate); Trevino v. United States, 804 F.2d 1512, 1517 (9th Cir. 1986)\n\n(following Pfeifer in calculating discount rate and noting “[t]he reason that risk-free investments\n\nare preferred to more remunerative but riskier investments is that the plaintiff should not be\n\nfaced with the burden of becoming a full-time broker merely to safeguard his award”).\n\n       Dr. Lurito based his discount rate on the yield rates for United States government bonds,\n\nwhich he considered to be “the best and safest investments” available. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at\n\n18:11–:25. The Court concludes that Dr. Lurito’s discount rate has a firm and reliable basis that\n\ncomports with the legal principles for application of a discount rate set forth in Pfeifer.\n\n                       c) Working Life\n\n       The final major difference between the two expert economists’ assumptions in\n\ndetermining the plaintiff’s future lost wages is the estimated length of time that the plaintiff\n\nwould continue working but for the defendant’s negligence. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Lurito,\n\nbased his estimate of 38.8 years on the plaintiff’s stated intent to work until age 65. Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 71 at 13:13–:16. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, based her estimate on tables from\n\na single economics journal article, published in 2006, that indicated the statistical average work\n\nlife for a woman of the plaintiff’s age was 27.37 years. Def.’s Ex. 37 at 8. Thus, a gap of over a\n\ndecade separates the experts’ assumption about the plaintiff’s work expectancy period and this\n\nhas a concomitant effect on the calculation of damages.\n\n       “The amount that the injured party would have earned but for the injury is not susceptible\n\nto precise measurement.” Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. McDavitt, 804 A.2d 275, 290 (D.C.\n\n2002) (internal quotation omitted). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has noted “in\n\n\n\n\n                                                     120\n\fevaluating lost earning capacity, the plaintiff’s occupational abilities, industriousness, work\n\nhabits, and experience are relevant.” Id. Thus, the focus in determining a plaintiff’s work\n\nexpectancy is on the particular plaintiff herself. “Statistics . . . are only one tool which may be\n\nused by an expert in forming an opinion.” 28 Weil v. Seltzer, 873 F.2d 1453, 1465 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n         Here, Dr. Lurito relied on the plaintiff’s express intent to work until the age of 65, which\n\nwas a very reasonable assumption for an expert to make given the plaintiff’s circumstances. The\n\nplaintiff is a single mother of two small children, with a high school education, and without an\n\nindependent source of wealth. See Trial Tr., ECF No. 55 at 74:17–:23; 75:1–11. It is entirely\n\nreasonable to believe that a woman in the plaintiff’s position would work (indeed, may find\n\nherself without a choice but to work) continuously until the age of 65. Moreover, the plaintiff’s\n\nwork ethic was on display during the trial, where she mentioned actively seeking a job even in\n\nher debilitated condition. See id. at 102:25; 103:1–9 (stating she had recently secured\n\nemployment with a cleaning company). It is also entirely common for courts in this district and\n\nthe local courts in the District of Columbia to credit an injured party’s intent to work until\n\nretirement age. See Buonocore v. Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nos. 06-\n\n727, 08-529, 2013 WL 351546, at *25 (calculating lost wages up to retirement age); Belkin v.\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran, 667 F. Supp. 2d 8, 15 (D.D.C. 2009) (same); Price v. Socialist People’s\n\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, 384 F. Supp. 2d 120, 137 (D.D.C. 2005) (same); United Mine Workers\n\nof Am., Int’l Union v. Moore, 717 A.2d 332, 340 (D.C. 1998) (crediting injured party’s statement\n\nfor worklife expectancy); Charles H. Tompkins Co. v. Girolami, 566 A.2d 1074, 1076 n.4 (D.C.\n\n28\n   In Weil, the jury was faced with the same choice with which the Court is faced here: the testimony of the injured\nparty (in Weil it was the injured party’s spouse) that she would work until a certain age, on the one hand, and a\nstatistical model, on the other. See Weil, 873 F.2d at 1464-65. The D.C. Circuit made clear that it was appropriate\nfor an expert to rely upon the “self-serving testimony” of the injured party “concerning the anticipated work-life\nexpectancy” so long as that expert was open to cross-examination. Id. at 1465.\n\n\n                                                             121\n\f1989) (“The court properly instructed the jury that [statistical] tables are only one factor (not\n\nconclusive) for it to consider in connection with other evidence of the claimant’s ‘health, habits,\n\nand activity’ in determining this claimant’s work-life expectancy.”).\n\n       Notably, while Dr. Hurdle cites statistics from one economics journal article to calculate\n\nthe plaintiff’s expected working life, she offers no reasons why the Court should accept those\n\nstatistics, why they are reliable, or why she chose those particular statistics or source. See Def.’s\n\nEx. 37 at 8 n.17 (citing Kurt Krueger et al., WORKLIFE IN A MARKOV MODEL WITH FULL-TIME\n\nAND PART-TIME ACTIVITY,      19 J. FORENSIC ECON. 80 (2006)). Set against the plaintiff’s\n\nstatement of intent and circumstances, as well as the caselaw that generally uses the retirement\n\nage of 65 in determining the work expectancy period, the Court finds that the assumption of the\n\nplaintiff’s expert, Dr. Lurito, that the plaintiff would have worked until age 65 to be firmly\n\ngrounded in the record and imminently reasonable.\n\n                                              *       *       *\n\n       In sum, the Court rejects as legally suspect or unreliable the key assumptions underlying\n\nthe defendant expert’s calculation of lost wages in favor of the plaintiff’s expert’s method for\n\ncomputing this aspect of the damages award. Therefore, the Court awards the plaintiff $737,715\n\nfor future lost wages.\n\n               4.        Loss of Household Services\n\n       Both parties concede that the loss of household services, which are described by the\n\nplaintiff’s expert as “the value of the services . . . Miss Rhodes would have provided to the\n\nchildren absent what’s happened to her,” are appropriate in this case. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 71\n\nat 20:22–25; Def.’s Ex. 37 at 12–13. The plaintiff’s expert estimates the loss of household\n\nservices to range from $508,121 to $652,939, Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 5, while the defendant’s expert\n\n\n\n\n                                                     122\n\festimates the loss to range from $164,729 to $347,628, depending on the method the defendant’s\n\nexpert used to calculate the loss. See Def.’s Ex. 37 at 15. Both parties calculate the loss of\n\nhousehold services to when the plaintiff’s youngest child reaches either the age of 18 or 21, well\n\npast the plaintiff’s estimated life expectancy. See Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 3; Def.’s Ex. 37 at 12–15.\n\n       The value of household services awarded in a personal injury case is to compensate the\n\ninjured party for her inability to do all of the things she was once able to do. See Lariscy v.\n\nUnited States, 655 F. Supp. 1053, 1058 (D.D.C. 1987). The plaintiff’s children are not parties to\n\nthis action and therefore the computation of the loss of household services do not inure to their\n\nbenefit but must be limited to the anticipated lifespan of the plaintiff. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 71\n\nat 20:22–25.\n\n       Here, there is no doubt the plaintiff is unable to do everything she was once able to do in\n\ntaking care of her children and her household. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 14:7–:8 (“[The\n\nplaintiff] doesn’t have the energy or the wherewithal to do it because she is in pain.”). Nurse\n\nPatterson also testified that there will come a time when, as a result of her Stage IV cancer, the\n\nplaintiff will be virtually unable to function at home and will need hospice care, quite possibly\n\nnecessitating a move into an assisted care facility. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 96:12–:24.\n\n       Both economics experts based their loss of household services estimates on the\n\nassumption that the plaintiff would be unable to provide for herself or her children as of January\n\n1, 2014, and that her life expectancy does not extend beyond October, 2014. See Pl.’s Ex. 54, at\n\n3–4; Def.’s Ex. 37, at 3, 12. Thus, the value of the household services the plaintiff will not be\n\nable to provide for during that ten month period must be determined. Once again, the parties’\n\nexperts differ as to how they calculate the value of lost household services.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    123\n\f       Dr. Lurito, the plaintiff’s expert, derived his valuation by determining the replacement\n\ncost, or what it would cost to hire a live-in nanny to provide the “household/parental services”\n\nthe plaintiff will no longer be able to provide due to her illness. Pl.’s Ex. 54, at 3. He estimated\n\nthat “the cost for a live-in homemaker to care for the children is at least $124 per day in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia area.” Id.\n\n       Dr. Hurdle, the defendant’s expert, offered two different estimates to account for the loss\n\nof household services. First, Dr. Hurdle accepted the plaintiff’s expert’s estimate for the cost of\n\na live-in nanny ($124 per day) and reduced the cost using an 8.98 percent discount rate to\n\naccount for the “risks associated with the need for a homemaker. For example, Ms. Rhodes\n\nherself may be able to provide these services for longer than assumed . . . or a relative other than\n\na live-in homemaker may choose to care for the children.” Def.’s Ex. 37, at 12. She also offered\n\nan alternative methodology where she used economic statistics tables to estimate the “average\n\nhourly value of household production in the District of Columbia.” Id. at 13 (citing Expectancy\n\nData, THE DOLLAR VALUE OF A DAY: 2010 DOLLAR VALUATION (2011)). The tables are\n\napparently based on a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor\n\nStatistics to determine “the number of hours that the average person spends performing\n\nhousehold services and the average wage that a person performing those services would earn.”\n\nId. This statistic does not appear to take account of the level of supervision required for small\n\nchildren, which is the actual circumstance of the plaintiff’s situation. Once again, Dr. Hurdle’s\n\ntheory is not grounded in the reality the plaintiff will experience.\n\n       Even if, as Dr. Hurdle suggests, the plaintiff is able to provide some household services\n\nin 2014, Def.’s Ex. 37, at 12, the plaintiff’s young children will require constant supervision and\n\nthe plaintiff’s home will require housekeeping when the plaintiff becomes incapacitated. It is\n\n\n\n\n                                                     124\n\freasonable to assume, in estimating the cost to the plaintiff for the loss of household services,\n\nthat she will have to pay market rates for a child care professional and/or a housekeeper to keep\n\nher household running. Dr. Lurito’s estimate uses such a market rate in determining the costs the\n\nplaintiff will incur. Therefore, the Court finds the plaintiff’s expert’s daily cost estimate to be\n\nwell-grounded in the record and particularized to the plaintiff’s circumstances.\n\n         The plaintiff’s expert estimates it will cost approximately $124 per day to compensate the\n\nplaintiff for her loss of household services. Pl.’s Ex. 54, at 3. The plaintiff is expected to be\n\nunable to provide household services beginning on January 1, 2014, which would represent a ten\n\nmonth gap before the end of her life expectancy during which she will need to pay for such\n\nservices. See Pl.’s Ex. 54, at 3–4; Def.’s Ex. 37, at 3, 12. At $124 per day for 304 days (the\n\nnumber of days in the year ending October 31), the Court finds $37,696 to be an appropriate\n\naward for the plaintiff’s loss of household services. 29\n\n                  5.       Pain and Suffering\n\n         Finally, the plaintiff requests a non-economic damages award of $6 million for her pain\n\nand suffering. Pl.’s. Concls. at 47. The defendant has failed to address the issue of non-\n\neconomic damages at all in its proposed conclusions of law. See generally Def.’s Concls. Thus,\n\nthe Court is left with virtually no response to the plaintiff’s request in determining the\n\n“notoriously difficult” matter of “determining an appropriate figure for intangible losses such as\n\nemotional suffering.” Bodoff v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 424 F. Supp. 2d 74, 86 (D.D.C. 2006).\n\nAny decision is obviously fact specific and the fact finder “has broad discretion in calculating\n\ndamages for pain and suffering.” See Stern v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 F. Supp. 2d 286, 300\n\n(D.D.C. 2003) (citing Taylor v. Washington Terminal Co., 409 F.2d 145, 150 (D.C. Cir. 1969)).\n\n\n29\n  Considering the amount awarded covers less than one year, it is unnecessary to apply any discount rate to this\naward.\n\n\n                                                            125\n\f       A brief survey of other medical malpractice and FTCA cases has yielded a wide variety\n\nof non-economic damages awards. See, e.g., Dugar v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 565 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 120, 127–28 (D.D.C. 2008) ($90,000 for pain and suffering awarded to plaintiff who\n\nexperienced a fractured clavicle in a bus accident); Calva-Cerqueira v. United States, 281 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 279, 294-95 (D.D.C. 2003) ($5 million in non-economic damages awarded to plaintiff,\n\nwho suffered brain damage and significant physical disfigurement as a result of defendant’s\n\nnegligence in vehicular accident); Primus v. Galgano, 329 F.3d 236, 239-240 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n($960,000 award for future pain and suffering upheld in case where plaintiff, due to her\n\nphysician’s malpractice, was not diagnosed with breast cancer for two years after the doctor\n\ninitially examined the patient); Kasongo v. United States, 523 F. Supp. 2d 759, 762 (N.D. Ill.\n\n2007) ($1 million awarded in pain and suffering to the family of an AIDS patient, whose doctor\n\nfailed to diagnosis her lactic acidosis, which resulted in her death); Fairhurst v. United States,\n\nNo. 03CV601, 2006 WL 2190553, at *4 (N.D. Fla. Aug. 1, 2006) ($400,000 awarded for pain\n\nand suffering for a cancer misdiagnosis).\n\n       More recently, a District of New Jersey court was confronted with a similar challenge of\n\ndetermining the amount of damages in an FTCA case brought by a plaintiff, who visited her\n\ndoctor when she was 41-years-old “requesting a mammogram and complaining of pain and a\n\nlump,” but was not diagnosed with breast cancer for an additional twenty-one months because\n\nher doctor violated the national standard of care. Fletcher v. St. Joseph Reg’l Med. Ctr., No. 10-\n\n1499, 2013 WL 1651806, at *7 (D.N.J. Apr. 15, 2013). In Fletcher, the plaintiff’s survival rate\n\ndropped from an 87.4 percent 10-year survival rate to zero. Id. at *11. The court awarded the\n\nplaintiff $3.25 million in non-economic pain and suffering damages. Id. at *10. The plaintiff in\n\nFletcher, like the plaintiff here, lost her breast and experienced “pain, suffering, loss of\n\n\n\n\n                                                     126\n\fenjoyment of life, anxiety, and fear of dying.” Id. at *10. Both the Fletcher plaintiff and the\n\nplaintiff in this case saw their breast cancer prognosis drop from likely survival to imminent\n\ndeath as a result of their physicians failing to follow the national standard of care and\n\nappropriately diagnose their breast cancer. See id. at *7-8. Both women now face cancers that\n\nhave metastasized into their bones, leading to great pain and suffering. Id. at 9. The Court finds\n\nthe facts in Fletcher remarkably similar to the facts here and therefore views it as a useful\n\nbenchmark.\n\n       A prerequisite for a pain and suffering damage award under District of Columbia law is\n\nthat the victim’s suffering must be “conscious” in order to be compensable. See Doe, 492 A.2d\n\nat 861. Juries in the District of Columbia are further instructed, when considering a damages\n\naward, that they may consider: (1) the extent and duration of any physical injuries sustained by\n\nthe plaintiff; (2) the effects that any physical injuries have on the overall physical and emotional\n\nwell-being of the plaintiff; (3) any physical pain and emotional distress that the plaintiff has\n\nsuffered in the past; (4) any physical pain and emotional distress that the plaintiff may suffer in\n\nthe future; (5) any disfigurement or deformity suffered by the plaintiff, as well as any humiliation\n\nor embarrassment associated with the disfigurement or deformity; (6) any inconvenience the\n\nplaintiff has experienced; and (7) any inconvenience the plaintiff may experience in the future.\n\nD.C. Standardized Civil Jury Instruction §13.01, 1-7; see also Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ramos, 782\n\nA.2d 280, 282 (D.C. 2001) (describing jury instruction provided in automobile accident case).\n\nThese instructions provide useful reference here.\n\n       Here, the plaintiff lives in constant pain and has not had a “significant pain free, truly\n\npain free period” since at least January, 2012. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 34:4–:5. Thus, the\n\n“extent and duration” of her injuries is continuous and will be so until her death. As for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    127\n\feffect her injuries “have on the overall physical and emotional well-being of the plaintiff” and\n\nemotional distress, the plaintiff experiences sadness and deep and constant feelings of guilt about\n\nthe way her impending death will affect her children. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 107:6–:9;\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 12:12–:15. She also fears death and the prospect of being unable to take\n\ncare of herself. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 14:2–:4 (“Her fear of death is probably just as strong\n\nas her fear of living . . . with pain and suffering and not able to function at all and play with her\n\nchildren.”). The District of Columbia also instructs jurors to consider “disfigurement or\n\ndeformity” and, here, the plaintiff has suffered through the loss of her breast and her hair due to\n\nher mastectomy and the effects of her chemotherapy. Id. at 9:19–:21; 31:22–:23; Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 55 at 105:19–:22. Finally, regarding past and future inconvenience, the plaintiff is conscious\n\nevery day of her life that she will die soon, leaving her young children without a mother. See\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 107:6–:9. Furthermore, at some point in the future, efforts at treating her\n\nsymptoms will fail and her pain will continue to grow worse. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 34:10–\n\n:20 (noting “at some point in the future . . . no treatment will be available” to the plaintiff and\n\nhospice care will be necessary).\n\n       Any determination of a non-economic damages award is, by necessity, fact-intensive and\n\ntailored to the specific circumstances of the plaintiff. As in the determination of past care costs,\n\nhowever, it is necessary to determine to what extent the plaintiff’s non-economic damages are\n\ncaused by the progression of her cancer to Stage IV and are segregable from damages she would\n\nhave suffered had her cancer been properly diagnosed and treated at Stage I. See III.D.1 supra.\n\nThe plaintiff does not allege, nor could she prove, that she would have endured no pain and\n\nsuffering if not for the defendant’s negligence. Indeed, as the plaintiff’s experts noted, the\n\nplaintiff most likely would have undergone a mastectomy and chemotherapy even had her cancer\n\n\n\n\n                                                     128\n\fbeen caught at Stage I. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 72:12–:20; 73:2–:10. Although her survival\n\nrate would have been nearly 100 percent, the plaintiff would always have lived in some fear that\n\nher cancer would return. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 77:14–:16. The Court is mindful in\n\nevaluating the plaintiff’s request for an award of $6 million that, even absent the defendant’s\n\nnegligence, she would have suffered some level of pain and suffering.\n\n        Nevertheless, the fact that the defendant’s negligence converted what was a likely\n\nsurvivable diagnosis to a certain death sentence has caused and will continue to cause pain and\n\nsuffering far beyond what the plaintiff would have endured had the defendant caught the\n\nplaintiff’s cancer when she first presented with symptoms. Again, the Court finds the Fletcher\n\ncourt’s award instructive, but notes that the plaintiff here has the added feelings of sadness and\n\nworries about leaving her children motherless and is more than a decade younger than the\n\nplaintiff in Fletcher and is therefore losing that much more of her life. Consequently, the Court\n\nfinds, upon consideration of the seven factors enumerated in the District of Columbia’s jury\n\ninstructions and the decisions in this and other Districts in similar FTCA cases, that an award of\n\n$3.5 million for non-economic damages is reasonably appropriate.\n\n                                          *       *         *\n\n        In total, the Court awards the following in economic and non-economic damages to the\n\nplaintiff:\n\n        -    $33,285.17 for the cost of past medical care;\n\n        -    $149,886 for the cost of future medical care;\n\n        -    $737,715 for future lost wages;\n\n        -    $37,696 for the loss of household services; and\n\n        -    $3,500,000 for pain and suffering.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      129\n\fThese costs total $4,458,582.17.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds Dr. Hill-Daniel breached the applicable\n\nnational standard of care in her treatment of the plaintiff as her primary care physician and this\n\nnegligence was the proximate cause of the progression of the plaintiff’s breast cancer from Stage\n\nI to incurable Stage IV. The Court further finds that the plaintiff has proven the costs she has\n\nalready incurred for medical expenses directly attributable to the defendant’s negligence and a\n\nreasonable estimate of the costs she will incur going forward. Therefore, the Court will enter\n\njudgment in favor of the plaintiff and award damages in the amount of $4,458,582.17.\n\n       A separate order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             Digitally signed by Beryl A.

(“Unity”) and Jamie Hill-Daniel, M.D., from December 2009 to March 2011. Pending\n\nbefore the Court is the plaintiff’s claim that Dr. Hill-Daniel and Unity acted negligently by\n\nfailing to refer her in a timely manner for diagnostic testing of her breasts and for failing to take\n\ncertain other steps to ensure the timely diagnosis of her breast cancer. During a week-long bench\n\ntrial, the Court heard evidence on the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant. 1 For the reasons\n\n\n1\n The Court’s jurisdiction over this suit is not disputed. The parties agree that Unity and Dr. Hill-Daniel are deemed\nto be employees of the Public Health Service eligible for Federal Tort Claims Act malpractice coverage pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 223(g) because Unity is a grantee of the Department of Health and Human Services. Def.’s Proposed\nConcls. of Law at 1 n.1; Pl.’s Corrected Proposed Concls. of Law at 1 n.1. The FTCA also requires as a\njurisdictional predicate that the plaintiff exhaust her administrative remedies.

See Compl. ¶ 2\n(plaintiff alleges that on September 19, 2011, the plaintiff presented claims to the U.S. Department of Health &\nHuman Services and that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services failed to issue any determination on\nthe plaintiff’s claim within the mandatory six-month administrative waiting period); Answer ¶ 2 (defendant admits\nthat the plaintiff presented claims to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services on or about September 19,\n2011 and that the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services has failed to issue an determination of the\nplaintiff’s claim).\n\fexplained below, the Court concludes that the plaintiff has sustained her burden of proof on the\n\nnegligence claim, that judgment must be entered for the plaintiff, and that damages will be\n\nawarded in the amount of $4,458,582.17.\n\nI.     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       On March 23, 2012, the plaintiff initiated this medical malpractice lawsuit by filing a\n\ncomplaint against the United States alleging that the defendant was negligent in multiple\n\nrespects, including:\n\n       1. Failing to timely diagnose and treat the plaintiff’s breast cancer;\n\n       2. Failing to timely and appropriately order and obtain diagnostic studies in light of the\n          plaintiff’s medical history, complaints, signs, and symptoms;\n\n       3. Failing to appreciate the seriousness of the plaintiff’s condition;\n\n       4. Failing to provide appropriate and timely follow-up care;\n\n       5. Failing to timely and appropriately examine the plaintiff;\n\n       6. Failing to timely and appropriately obtain, interpret, and act upon the plaintiff’s\n          medical history and physical findings;\n\n       7. Failing to timely and appropriately assess the plaintiff’s condition;\n\n       8. Failing to timely and appropriately obtain consultations and/or interventions from\n          other health care providers;\n\n       9. Failing to make timely and appropriate referrals for diagnostic testing, care, and\n          treatment; and\n\n       10. Failing to take timely and appropriate steps to protect the health and well-being of the\n           plaintiff.\n\nCompl., ECF No. 1, ¶ 18.\n\n       At the plaintiff’s request, the Court imposed an expedited discovery and motions\n\nschedule, see Scheduling Order, ECF No. 9, and an expedited trial date, see Pretrial Order, ECF\n\n\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fNo. 20. 2 Shortly before trial, the defendant moved to amend its answer to the complaint to add a\n\ndefense of contributory negligence, and the plaintiff moved to preclude the defendant from\n\nnewly asserting the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and any claim of negligence\n\non the part of a third-party, Providence Hospital. See Pl.’s Mot. to Preclude New Assertions of\n\nContributory Negligence Defense and Any Claims of Negligence By Providence Hosp., ECF No.\n\n36; Def.’s Mem. Opp. to Pl.’s Mot. to Preclude Assertion of Contributory Negligence and Any\n\nClaims of Negligence by Providence Hospital and Mot. to Am. Answer, ECF No. 40. For the\n\nreasons stated at the hearing on these motions, on June 18, 2013, the Court granted the plaintiff’s\n\nmotion in part and denied the defendant’s motion, precluding as untimely the defendant’s\n\nassertion of a contributory negligence affirmative defense but permitting the defendant’s\n\nadmission of evidence regarding negligence on the part of Providence Hospital. See Minute\n\nOrder (June 18, 2013). 3, 4\n\n\n2\n  The schedule was subsequently modified upon requests made by both parties. See Minute Order (August 22,\n2012) (granting joint motion to amend scheduling order); Minute Order (November 16, 2012) (granting consent\nmotion for extension of time to complete discovery and for the defendant’s expert witness disclosures); Minute\nOrder (March 11, 2013 (granting joint motion to extend scheduling order); Minute Order (April 22, 2013) (granting\njoint motion for extension of time to complete discovery and to file motions in limine).\n3\n The Court relied on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c), which requires a defendant to state any affirmative\ndefenses, including contributory negligence, in a pleading responsive to the complaint. The purpose of that\nrequirement is to give the opposing party notice of the defense and to permit the opposing party to develop in\ndiscovery and present both evidence and argument before the district court responsive to the defense. Failure to\ncomply with Rule 8(c)’s timing requirement generally results in the waiver of that defense and its exclusion from the\ncase. Harris v. Secretary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184335\"><a href=\"/opinion/184335/harris-geraldine-v-vet-affairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citing Banks v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tele. Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"477929\"><a href=\"/opinion/477929/gladys-banks-v-chesapeake-and-potomac-telephone-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1416</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). The Court, however, recognized that “the purpose of pleading is to facilitate\na proper decision on the merits,” id., and that a defendant should be granted leave to amend an answer “when justice\nso requires,” in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15. FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(2). Courts in this Circuit\nevaluate when “justice so requires,” by looking to a number of factors, including whether the moving party engaged\nin undue delay and whether undue prejudice to the opposing party would result by virtue of allowance of the\namendment. See Foman v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182 (1962). Assessing the circumstances of this case, the Court\nfound that both undue delay and unfair prejudice would result if the defendant were permitted to amend its answer\nmore than nine months after the deadline set out in the applicable Scheduling Order for such amendments, and just\ntwo weeks before the bench trial was scheduled to commence. The plaintiff convincingly argued that her approach\nin discovery would have differed had she known of the defendant’s intention to prove contributory negligence –\nwhich, in this jurisdiction, operates as a complete bar to recovery – and with discovery closed at the time that the\ndefendant finally raised it, the plaintiff had lost that opportunity. See Atchinson v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710872\"><a href=\"/opinion/710872/richard-atchinson-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (D.C.

In response, the defendant called the plaintiff’s primary care physician, two\n\nUnity employees, one employee of Providence Hospital, one of the plaintiff’s treating\n\nphysicians, and three medical expert witnesses. The defendant also played the videotaped de\n\nbene esse deposition of one damages expert witness. Following the conclusion of the bench trial,\n\nboth parties submitted proposed conclusions of law.

FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n        A.      OVERVIEW OF WITNESSES\n\n                1.       Plaintiff’s Witnesses\n\n        The plaintiff presented the testimony of the following ten witnesses, whose testimony is\n\nbriefly summarized below: Shilisa Rhodes; her treating oncologist, Dal Yoo, M.D.; the\n\nradiologist who interpreted two of her diagnostic images, Joel Bowers, M.D.; two expert\n\nwitnesses in the national standard of care, John Sutherland, M.D., and Katherine Margo, M.D.;\n\none expert witness in pathology, F. Lee Tucker, M.D.; one expert witness in oncology, Peter\n\nPushkas, M.D.; one expert witness in the psychology of loss and grief, Mila R. Tecala, MSW,\n\nACSW, LICSW, DCSW; one expert witness in end of life costs, Terri Sue Patterson, RN, MSN,\n\nCRRN; and one expert witness in economics, Richard J. Lurito, Ph.D. Plaintiff also played an\n\naudio recording of excerpts from the deposition testimony of her primary care physician, Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel.\n\n                         a)     John Sutherland, M.D.\n\n        Dr. Sutherland is a board-certified family physician, who maintained private practices in\n\nMinneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, for eleven years, and has practiced in academic institutions\n\nin Minneapolis, Illinois, and Iowa for the past thirty-three years. Pl.’s Ex. 35 (Dr. Sutherland’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\fCV); Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 31:2–:5, 34:3–:5. Dr. Sutherland testified as one of two medical\n\nexperts for the plaintiff on the national standard of care applicable to a family practice physician\n\nregarding a primary care physician’s appropriate response to a patient’s breast complaints,\n\nincluding the steps necessary to ensure that diagnostic testing and specialty consultations are\n\nperformed on a timely basis. Id. at 32:22–33:5. Specifically, Dr. Sutherland opined that Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel breached the national standard of care by: (1) failing to fully investigate the\n\nplaintiff’s breast complaints on December 3, 2009; (2) failing either to schedule a return visit for\n\nthe plaintiff thirty to sixty days after the December 3, 2009 visit to reassess her complaints, or to\n\nrefer the plaintiff immediately for diagnostic imaging studies on that date; (3) delaying the\n\nplaintiff’s diagnosis by cancelling and rescheduling appointments multiple times; and (4) failing\n\nto take measures to expedite diagnostic testing after Dr. Hill-Daniel palpated a mass in the\n\nplaintiff’s left breast and lymph nodes under her left armpit on October 18, 2010.

Dr. Tucker testified as the plaintiff’s expert about the behavior and\n\npathology of breast cancer, and its prognosis, diagnosis, staging, and curability. He opined that\n\nthe plaintiff’s breast cancer was Stage I in December 2009, and that if it had been diagnosed and\n\ntreated at that point, it would most likely have been cured. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 11:14–:19.\n\nHe also opined that sometime between July and November 2010, her cancer became Stage II by\n\nmetastasizing to the lymph nodes, and that it became Stage IV incurable cancer by metastasizing\n\nto her bone sometime between December 2010 and February 2011.

Dr. Pushkas testified as one\n\nof plaintiff’s expert witnesses about the staging and progression of breast cancer. Dr. Pushkas\n\nopined that in December 2009, the plaintiff had Stage I breast cancer, that it progressed to Stage\n\nII sometime between July and August 2010, and that it progressed to Stage IV sometime between\n\nDecember 2010 and March 2011. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 67:16–69:5, 74:16–:24. Dr. Pushkas\n\nalso opined that if the plaintiff’s breast cancer had been diagnosed and treated while Stage I, she\n\nwould likely have had a 98% chance of survival, id. at 77:14–78:6; and while Stage II, a chance\n\nof survival in the 70% range.

Nurse Patterson testified about the “cost and services for hospice care and\n\npalliative care” for the plaintiff through the end of the plaintiff’s life. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at\n\n\n\n\n                                                      9\n\f93:9–:15. In evaluating medical costs for the plaintiff’s care, Nurse Patterson examined\n\npalliative and hospice care, medical care, counseling services, and home care and/or hospice\n\ninpatient treatment. Id. at 94:13–17. Based on Ms. Tecala’s recommendation that the plaintiff\n\nattend weekly counseling sessions with a psychologist or social worker, Nurse Patterson\n\nestimated the cost of counseling for the plaintiff as $175 per week for 18 months, for a total of\n\n$13,650. Id. at 94:20–:22, 95:11; Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10. Nurse Patterson also opined that patients\n\nusually require palliative and hospice care for the last six months of life. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at\n\n94:13–:17. On that basis, she estimated the cost of six months of hospice care at $200 per day\n\nfor ninety days of in-home care ($18,000 total), and $700 per day for ninety days of inpatient\n\ncare, ($63,000 total). Id. at 96:6–:10, 96:25–97: 2; Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10. For the plaintiff’s medical\n\ncosts, Nurse Patterson estimated that during the last six months of her life, the plaintiff will\n\nrequire an oncologist’s care at $200 per visit, twice per month, for a total cost of $2,400; a\n\nprimary care physician’s care twice per month at $70 per visit, for a total cost of $840; and a pain\n\nmanagement specialist once a month at $500 per visit, for a total cost of $3,000. Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 56 at 97:15–18; Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10. Nurse Patterson estimated the cost of a twenty-four-hour\n\nper day in-home health aide for the last three months of the plaintiff’s life at $23 an hour, for a\n\ntotal of $49,680. Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10. In total, Nurse Patterson estimated the cost of the plaintiff’s\n\nfuture care needs at $150,570. Trial Tr.

Pl.’s Ex. 41, at 1.\n\nHe specializes in the area of determining economic loss. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 10:18–:20. Dr.\n\nLurito testified that the plaintiff could expect to suffer three types of economic loss: loss of\n\nearnings, loss of household services and future care costs. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 12:14–:23.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     10\n\fAs to loss of earnings, Dr. Lurito testified that the plaintiff would earn $737,715 in today’s\n\ndollars if her income stayed the same for the rest of her working life, which he assumed would\n\nend at age 65. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 13:13–:15; 14:1–:20; 15:14–:25. Dr. Lurito testified that\n\nhe applied a discount rate of 3.5 percent to all of his calculations to reflect the interest on the\n\njudgment. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 16:16–22; 17:16-:21; 23:4–:11; 25:24–26:1. Dr. Lurito\n\ncalculated the economic value of the loss of the plaintiff’s household services – which Dr. Lurito\n\ngenerally defined as the ability to provide childcare services to the plaintiff’s children – to be\n\nbetween $508,121 and $652,939. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 20:5–:13; 21:13–18. Dr. Lurito\n\ntestified that the range represents the difference between household services being provided until\n\nthe plaintiff’s youngest child reaches age eighteen or age twenty-one. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at\n\n21:5–:9. Finally, Dr. Lurito testified that the plaintiff’s future care costs, i.e., the costs of her\n\ntreatment until her death, were between $146,682 and $149,886. 7 Trial Tr.

Feigert, M.D.; and one expert witness in economics, Gloria Hurdle, Ph.D. (by\n\nvideo deposition).\n\n                           a)       Jamie Hill-Daniel, M.D.\n\n\n\n7\n  Dr. Lurito applied a 3.75 or 4 percent “escalation rate” to some of the estimates Nurse Patterson provided to reflect\nthe increase in costs over the time in which the plaintiff would need future care, as well as applying a 3.5 percent\ndiscount rate to the costs to develop a present cost estimate that differs slightly from Nurse Patterson’s estimate.\n\n\n                                                              11\n\f       Dr. Hill-Daniel is a board-certified family medicine doctor with a practice at Unity’s\n\nCongress Heights location. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 60:10–:16, 61:15–:19, 64:23–:25. Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel testified that she also works as an assistant clinical professor for the Georgetown School\n\nof Medicine, the George Washington School of Medicine, and the Georgetown Residency\n\nProgram, and that she acts as both a staff physician and an attending physician at Providence\n\nHospital, with admitting privileges. Id. at 61:23–64:3. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified about her\n\ntreatment of the plaintiff as her primary care physician and, in particular, for the plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaints about pain, tenderness and knots in her breasts. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that even in\n\nhindsight, she would not have responded to the plaintiff’s breast complaints any differently than\n\nshe did. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 47:4–:15.\n\n                       b)      Terita Lynette Jones\n\n       Terita Jones is a care management support person for Unity at the Congress Heights\n\nlocation. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 8:23–9:8. Ms. Jones testified about how Unity processes\n\nreferrals and obtains insurance authorizations. She testified that she processes over fifty referrals\n\nper day for Dr. Hill-Daniel and three other physicians, and that she processed the referrals and\n\nauthorizations for the plaintiff to obtain diagnostic tests at Providence Hospital. Id. at 9:12–:14,\n\n26:7–:8. She also testified that she re-processed the plaintiff’s paperwork on November 3, 2010\n\nafter the plaintiff appeared for her appointment at Providence Hospital to obtain a diagnostic\n\nultrasound but could not obtain the test because Dr. Hill-Daniel had entered the wrong code on\n\nthe plaintiff’s referral and authorization forms. Id. at 22:14–31:21.\n\n                       c)      Diana Lapp, M.D.\n\n       Dr. Lapp is the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Vice President for Medical\n\nAdministration for Unity, and she testified about the policies and procedures in place to handle\n\n\n\n\n                                                      12\n\fthe between 550 and 600 patients seen each week at Unity’s Congress Heights location. Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 72 at 71:16–:20; 77:13–:15. Dr. Lapp testified that at a typical visit to Unity, a patient\n\nwill generally see a registration assistant for check-in, then a medical assistant who takes down\n\nher complaints, and then the doctor. Id. at 84:5–86:13. A patient may see a doctor either by\n\nmaking an appointment or walking in. Id. at 83:1–:6.\n\n                           d)       Richard Carter, M.D. 8\n\n         Dr. Carter is an emergency medicine doctor at Howard University Hospital who treated\n\nthe plaintiff for breast complaints on May 19, 2010. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 119:13–:15. Dr.\n\nCarter testified that his records of the visit reflect that the plaintiff’s chief complaint was\n\ntenderness in her left breast. Id. at 119:11–:12. He performed a physical exam and found\n\nmultiple tender breast cysts – one of which was particularly large – and no signs of infection. Id.\n\nat 122:6–123:23. Dr. Carter testified that he told the plaintiff to follow up with her primary care\n\nphysician. Id. at 123:24–124:9.\n\n                           e)       Marsha Williams\n\n         Ms. Williams is employed as a front desk registration clerk at Providence Hospital with\n\nresponsibility for performing intake for patients who have appointments for diagnostic\n\nmammograms, regular mammograms, ultrasounds, and bone-density scans. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n8\n  Dr. Carter was subpoenaed to appear at trial by counsel for the defendant. Before he took the stand to testify,\nplaintiff’s counsel raised an objection that defendant’s counsel had improperly spoken with Dr. Carter about the\nplaintiff’s care without proper authorization under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966\n(“HIPAA”). Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 108:12–:24. Two lead attorneys for the defendant orally represented to the\nCourt that they had never spoken to Dr. Carter. See id. 108:25–109:2, 109:20–:24. The Court determined that the\nbest course was to proceed with Dr. Carter’s examination, which would clarify the factual dispute about whether Dr.\nCarter had, in fact, been interviewed by defense counsel, and permit the parties to brief the issue of the alleged\nHIPAA violation after conclusion of the trial. Id. at 111:20–112:3. Just moments before Dr. Carter took the witness\nstand, however, a third attorney for the defendant, who did not examine any of the witnesses at trial, came forward\nand identified himself as the defense counsel who had interviewed Dr. Carter at the express direction of one of the\ntwo lead attorneys. Neither of the two lead defense attorneys, when denying any contact with Dr. Carter, had\nindicated to the Court that they had knowledge of any contact by another defense counsel with Dr. Carter or that\nanother attorney on the defense team had actually been directed to interview him. These blatant omissions by the\ntwo lead defense attorneys fall short of the level of candor that this Court expects under Rule 3.3 of the D.C. Rules\nof Professional Conduct.\n\n\n                                                             13\n\f72 at 141:4–:21. Ms. Williams testified that she was working when the plaintiff came in for an\n\nultrasound test on November 3, 2010, but the plaintiff could not have the procedure done\n\nbecause the code on her referral and insurance authorization was not accepted by Providence\n\nHospital. Id. at 144:21–146:6, 147:9–148:24. Ms. Williams also testified that in 2010 to 2011,\n\nultrasound appointments were scheduled about a week in advance, but if there were a need, they\n\ncould be scheduled within a couple of days, and that mammograms could be scheduled within a\n\nweek or two.

Dr. Hurdle’s\n\nvideotaped de bene esse deposition was played during the bench trial and a transcript of Dr.\n\nHurdle’s deposition was introduced into evidence as Defendant’s Exhibit 36. Dr. Hurdle\n\ntestified about the plaintiff’s lost net earnings, lost household services, and future care costs.\n\nDef.’s Ex. 36 at 11:12–:24. Dr. Hurdle testified she calculated the plaintiff’s lost net income by\n\nassuming that the only change to the plaintiff’s salary over time would be inflation and by\n\nsubtracting a discount rate of 8.98 percent, to reflect the “riskiness” of the plaintiff’s ability to\n\nearn future wages. Id. at 15:3–:5, 18:14–19:12, 21:9–:17. In calculating these lost wages, Dr.\n\nHurdle used work-life expectancy tables to estimate that the plaintiff would have worked twenty-\n\nseven years between 2012 and retirement at age sixty-five. Id. at 29:2–5. She further reduced\n\nthe lost net income estimate by subtracting the amount of the plaintiff’s “consumption” during\n\nher lifetime. Id. at 15:9–:12. In estimating the loss of household services, Dr. Hurdle applied the\n\nsame discount rate of 8.98 percent and estimated the pecuniary loss to the plaintiff as between\n\n$166,521 (if calculated up to the plaintiff’s youngest child turning eighteen) and $191,239 (if\n\ncalculated up to the plaintiff’s youngest child turning twenty-one). Id. at 27:4–:7, 27:19. Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       14\n\fHurdle calculated the plaintiff’s total cost of future care as between $90,434 (if the plaintiff uses\n\nin-home hospice care) and $111,889 (if the plaintiff uses inpatient hospice care).

Def.’s Ex. 24, at 2 (Dr. Bethea’s CV). Dr. Bethea testified as\n\na defense expert witness regarding the national standard of care regarding a family medicine\n\ndoctor’s responsibility to investigate and diagnose a patient’s complaints for breast cancer. Dr.\n\nBethea opined that Dr. Hill-Daniel satisfied the national standard of care at the plaintiff’s first\n\nvisit for breast complaints in December 2009 by reassuring her of the benign nature of her\n\nconcerns, advising her to change her bra, and prescribing pain medication, and that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel also satisfied the national standard of care in her treatment of the plaintiff at subsequent\n\nvisits in early 2010 when she did not ask the plaintiff about the status of any breast complaints.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 21:12–:19, 35:21–36:10. He also testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not\n\ndeviate from the standard of care after the plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 visit, when Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel palpated a mass in the plaintiff’s left breast and lymph nodes under her left armpit,\n\ndespite permitting five-months to elapse between the visit and the diagnosis of breast cancer,\n\nalthough he conceded that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s treatment at that time did not meet best practices.\n\nId. at 40:14–45:23.\n\n                       h)      Edward Graeme Koch, M.D.\n\n       Dr. Koch is board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology.

Dr. Koch opined that\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel did not deviate from the applicable standard of care by treating the plaintiff’s\n\nsymptoms at the December 3, 2009 visit and ensuring the plaintiff that the symptoms were\n\nbenign, by not following-up on the plaintiff’s breast complaints at her subsequent visits, by\n\nordering a six week follow-up period after referring the plaintiff for a diagnostic ultrasound, and\n\nby then proceeding to order a mammogram and a biopsy in that progression. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n73 at 76:9–79:6, 85:5–:18, 95:20–98:14, 99:1–105:9.\n\n                       i)      John M. Feigert, M.D.\n\n       Dr. Feigert is a hematologist oncologist who is board-certified in internal medicine,\n\nhematology, and oncology. Def.’s Ex. 26, at 1(Dr. Feigert’s CV); see also Trial Tr. ECF No. 57\n\nat 22:20–23:7. He currently works in private practice in Arlington, Virginia. Def.’s Ex. 26, at 1;\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 23:14–:18. Dr. Feigert testified as a defense expert on the character,\n\nqualities, staging, and prognosis of breast cancer. Dr. Feigert opined that as of December 3,\n\n2009, the plaintiff’s cancer was at least Stage III-B because it had already infiltrated her skin,\n\nand that it was likely Stage IV because it had probably also metastasized into her bone. Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 57 at 30:13–:18. He also testified that, based upon his opinion about the staging of the\n\nplaintiff’s cancer, if diagnosed in December 2009, the plaintiff’s chance of survival would have\n\nbeen less than 50%. Id. at 61:10–:25.\n\n       B.      CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT\n\n1. The majority of the witnesses who provided testimony during the bench trial were expert\n\n   witnesses and the plaintiff’s treating physicians. The witnesses generally testified credibly.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     16\n\f   Ms. Jones, Dr. Lapp, and Ms. Williams also testified as non-party fact witnesses and they\n\n   presented the facts of which they had first-hand knowledge in a frank and candid manner.\n\n2. The Court found the plaintiff to be entirely credible. Her testimony was consistent. For\n\n   example, despite a lengthy and aggressive cross-examination about how long she had been\n\n   feeling knots in her breast when she visited Dr. Hill-Daniel in December 2009, her\n\n   recollection that she only began feeling them around the time of that visit never wavered.\n\n   See Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 108:24–109:1 (“Q: Did you tell [Dr. Hill-Daniel] that you had\n\n   been having the knot for three years before [December 3, 2009]? A: No.”); id. at 113:6–:9\n\n   (“So, if you went back to Fort Washington in August 2010, and if we are counting back three\n\n   years from 2010, would you agree that you knew about those knots in 2007? A: No, I did not\n\n   know about the knots in 2007.”); id. at 113:11–:15 (Responding to a question from defense\n\n   counsel about whether she testified at her deposition that she had been feeling the knots for\n\n   three years prior to the December 3, 2009, visit, the plaintiff replied “I mean, I probably\n\n   didn’t understand the question. But I know in 2007, I did not have no knots on my left\n\n   breast. . . . I mean, I wouldn’t agree that I had the knots in 2006 because I know I didn’t\n\n   have no knots in 2006.”); Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 43:6–44:1 (On redirect, the plaintiff’s\n\n   counsel quoted this passage from the deposition transcript: “Question: Right. But you told\n\n   them that you had them for three years? This is August of 2010. Answer: I had the knot\n\n   when I seen Dr. Hill-Daniel, so more, I mean came at that time. [Question:] Did you have\n\n   those lumps for three years prior to August of 2010? Answer: Not that I recall. I had them\n\n   at the time I went to see Hill-Daniel. So I don’t know if they – it wasn’t there before I went\n\n   to see her, like the first visit I complained about the knot. [Question:] You had them before\n\n   that? . . . Answer: No, I didn’t. The first time that I seen, actually seen the knot was the first\n\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\f   time I visited her in December of 2009. Question: And you – your testimony is that you did\n\n   not have any lumps in your breast prior to December of 2009? Answer: I had – I haven’t\n\n   had no lumps before – I mean before that December visit that I know of.”). All the while, the\n\n   plaintiff’s demeanor was firm, but not defensive.\n\n3. Furthermore, despite an unexplained lapse in memory regarding her visit to the emergency\n\n   room at Howard University Hospital on May 19, 2010, the plaintiff was forthcoming and\n\n   straightforward. She readily admitted when she did not personally remember an event, and\n\n   she did not appear to substitute speculation about what might have occurred for actual\n\n   memory. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 82:19–:23 (“The Court: Were you, during [the\n\n   January 8, 2010] visit, still having pain and tenderness in your breasts? Do you recall? The\n\n   Witness: I don’t remember at that time. But I know I just remembered what she told me\n\n   about the problems that I had with the knot and the pain in my left breast.”); id. at 83:15–:25\n\n   (“Q: Let’s talk about the April 30th, 2010 visit with Dr. Hill-Daniel. Do you recall going to\n\n   see Dr. Hill-Daniel on this date for a checkup and problems with your eyes? A: Yes. Q:\n\n   Okay. At that time, do you recall if Dr. Hill-Daniel asked you if you were having any\n\n   problems with your breasts? A: No. Q: Were you having any problems with your breasts?\n\n   A: Actually, no. Q: Was the knot still present? A: It was the same thing as from the first\n\n   visit in 2009.”).\n\n4. The Court also found Dr. Hill-Daniel to be credible in some areas and not in others. Despite\n\n   Dr. Hill-Daniel’s insistence that she remembered her encounters with the plaintiff first-hand,\n\n   it was clear to the Court that her memory of the events giving rise to this case – particularly\n\n   those that took place in 2009 and early 2010 – was based on what was written in the patient\n\n   progress notes, and generalizations about her patients. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n\n\n\n                                                    18\n\f50:13–:24 (“Q: Do you recall testifying in your deposition that you had no recall of\n\nconversations that were not recorded in the medical records? Do you recall giving that\n\ntestimony? A: At the beginning of the deposition, yes, I said I didn’t recall other than what\n\nwas in the chart. But by the end of the deposition, even [the plaintiff’s counsel] noted that I\n\ndid recall other instances with more interactions with [the plaintiff] than came out during the\n\ndeposition. Q: And apparently since the deposition, you’ve had further recall about the\n\nconversations that you had with [the plaintiff]; is that accurate to say? A: Yes.”). Dr. Hill\n\nDaniel sees an average of twenty to twenty-two patients per day, five days per week, Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 71 at 65:6–8; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 88:2–14, and there was nothing about the\n\nplaintiff’s December 2009, January 2010, or April 2010 visits that seemed particularly\n\nnotable to Dr. Hill-Daniel at the time. Moreover, when asked questions about what happened\n\nduring the plaintiff’s various visits, Dr. Hill-Daniel often responded by referring to what was\n\nwritten in the progress note. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 4:6–:12 (“Q: And what\n\nhistory did the patient give you [on December 3, 2009]? A: As noted in the chart, [the\n\nplaintiff] came in with . . . .”); id. at 20:13–:17 (“Q: What course of action did you take to\n\nresolve the complaints [at the January 8, 2010 visit]? A: Well, as you see from the history,\n\nwhen someone comes in basically questioning fertility, we do counseling for family\n\nplanning.”). Sometimes Dr. Hill-Daniel responded to questions about her interactions with\n\nthe plaintiff by referring to her general practices. See, e.g., id. at 10:3–:15 (Q: Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel, would you show us how you did the physical examination of Ms. Rhodes’ breasts?\n\nHow did you examine her breasts? . . . A: Sure. To do a clinical breast exam, we ask the\n\nwoman to disrobe from the waist up. So, I asked her to take her shirt and her bra off . . . .\n\nWhen I came in the room, I have the patient sit on the examination table. The first part of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f   exam is observation. So, I look at her breasts while she is sitting . . . . And then I have the\n\n   patient lie supine on the table and I begin the exam.”). These characteristics cast some doubt\n\n   on the credibility of Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony regarding details of the plaintiff’s early visits\n\n   that were not recorded in the progress notes, and the Court has some concern that her\n\n   testimony about those visits was based on wishful speculation rather than personal memory.\n\n5. In addition, Dr. Hill-Daniel displayed some signs of dissembling, such as the evasive nature\n\n   of her answers to questions about whether she was or was not the plaintiff’s primary care\n\n   physician, see, e.g., id. at 48:3–:15 (stating that “as I stated before in my deposition, at the\n\n   time I didn’t necessarily consider her my patient,” but conceding that in accordance with\n\n   Unity policy, “I would have considered her my patient by then”), and her inadequate\n\n   explanations about certain notations in the plaintiff’s medical records, see, e.g., id. at 6:19–\n\n   7:10 (asked by the Court why she wrote “no history of cancer in first degree relatives”\n\n   despite her testimony that she asked Ms. Rhodes “if she had any family history of breast\n\n   cancer,” Dr. Hill-Daniel responded with an explanation of the medical significance of family\n\n   history in first-degree relatives and stated “So, it’s very, I guess for myself, I wanted to be\n\n   clear of what she is saying, that even though she is saying that there is no family history, but\n\n   there’s definitely – she’s definitely denying any first degree relative”).\n\n       C.      PLAINTIFF’S BACKGROUND\n\n1. At the time of the bench trial, the plaintiff was 27-years old. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   6:2–:5. She is a high school graduate, id. at 6:12–:15, who was employed as a food service\n\n   worker at United Medical Center from 2009 until March 2013. Id. 6:8–:11, 104:8–13. She\n\n   stopped working in March 2013 because the pain she experienced from her breast cancer,\n\n   which had metastasized to her bones, prevented her from standing for the amount of time her\n\n\n\n\n                                                     20\n\f   job required. Id. 103:14–104:1. Since then, she has interviewed for other jobs, id. 103:5–:7,\n\n   and she was recently hired by a cleaning company, id. 103:7–:9. At the time of the bench\n\n   trial, she was waiting for that job offer to be finalized. Id. She is not married and has two\n\n   children, who at the time of the bench trial were eight and nine years old. Id. 75:4–:11.\n\n2. Both of the plaintiff’s grandmothers were diagnosed with breast cancer before the events that\n\n   gave rise to this action. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 75:21–76:11. Her paternal grandmother\n\n   died of breast cancer in 1994, id. at 76:1–:6, and her maternal grandmother was diagnosed\n\n   with breast cancer in her thirties and was living at the time of trial, id. at 76:5–:11.\n\n       D.      DR. HILL-DANIEL’S PRACTICE AND UNITY PROCEDURES\n\n1. Dr. Hill-Daniel sees an average of about twenty to twenty-two patients per day as a family\n\n   practice physician at the Congress Heights location of Unity. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 65:6–\n\n   :8; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 88:2–:14. Each patient is allotted a fifteen-minute visit. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 71 at 65:11–:12. Dr. Hill-Daniel performs breast exams regularly as part of the\n\n   annual exams for women, called “well-woman visits,” and when a patient has a specific\n\n   breast complaint. Id. at 66:6–:8, 73:7–:10. It is very rare for Dr. Hill-Daniel to see a woman\n\n   under the age of thirty for a specific breast complaint. Id. at 66:9–:11.\n\n2. Dr. Lapp, a representative of Unity, testified that when a patient first comes in to the\n\n   Congress Heights location of Unity, the patient is seen by a registration assistant, and then\n\n   speaks with a medical assistant before seeing the provider. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 84:5–:9.\n\n   The registration assistant records information related to the visit – i.e. type of visit,\n\n   established patient or new patient – in the electronic medical record under “reason for\n\n   appointment.” Id. at 84:22–85:5. The patient then sees a medical assistant, who asks why\n\n   the patient has come in for a visit and records the patient’s answer in the electronic medical\n\n\n\n\n                                                      21\n\f   record, also under “reason for appointment.” Id. at 85:5–:7. Dr. Lapp testified that\n\n   communication between the medical assistant and the physician is largely done electronically\n\n   or by paper, id. at 85:20–86:3, and that by the time the physician sees the patient, the medical\n\n   assistant has already turned to the next patient. Id. at 86:4–:13.\n\n3. Dr. Hill-Daniel first saw the plaintiff as a patient for a well-woman visit on July 25, 2008.\n\n   Def.’s Ex. 1, at 3; Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 73:5–:12. Dr. Hill-Daniel saw the plaintiff again\n\n   in September 2008, April 2009, and August 2009 for complaints unrelated to the plaintiff’s\n\n   breasts. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 4–6; Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 75:9–:22, 76:10–:17, 77:6–:19. Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel testified that although the plaintiff was never formally assigned as a patient to Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel, doctors at Unity assume the role of primary care physician for a particular\n\n   patient after seeing the patient three times. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 48:18–:21. By the time\n\n   of the plaintiff’s December 2009 visit to the Unity clinic, Dr. Hill-Daniel had seen her at least\n\n   four separate times. Id. at 48:22–25.\n\n       E.      THE PLAINTIFF’S VISIT WITH DR. HILL-DANIEL ON DECEMBER 3,\n               2009\n\n1. The plaintiff visited the Congress Heights location of Unity on December 3, 2009, for a\n\n   scheduled visit with Dr. Hill-Daniel. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 78:17–:25; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066.\n\n   There is some dispute as to whether the plaintiff told the Unity healthcare providers that she\n\n   felt a knot specifically in her left breast or whether she described feeling knots in both\n\n   breasts.\n\n       a) The plaintiff testified that she told Dr. Hill-Daniel that she had soreness and\n\n            tenderness in both of her breasts, and a pain and a knot in her left breast. Trial Tr.\n\n            ECF No. 55 at 78:12–:16 (the plaintiff’s testimony that the reason for her visit was\n\n            “soreness and tenderness in both of [her] breasts and pain and a knot in [her] left\n\n\n\n                                                      22\n\f   breast”); see also id. at 17:19–:22. She testified that the pain had started about a\n\n   month before the appointment. Id. at 78:20–79:2. There is no dispute that the\n\n   plaintiff asked Dr. Hill-Daniel for a mammogram. Id. at 78:14–:15 (plaintiff’s\n\n   testimony that she asked Dr. Hill-Daniel for a mammogram); Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n   13:23–:24 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony that at the December 3, 2009 appointment, the\n\n   plaintiff asked her “if she needed a mammogram for her complaint”).\n\nb) Dr. Hill-Daniel denied that the plaintiff complained of a knot in the left breast, but\n\n   testified that she complained that both breasts were sore and had knots in them. Trial\n\n   Tr. ECF No. 58 at 4:7–:12 (“[The plaintiff] held under her breasts and basically just\n\n   motioned that both breasts were tender and felt lumpy.”). According to Dr. Hill-\n\n   Daniel, she specifically asked if there was any particular place where the plaintiff felt\n\n   the “knot,” and the plaintiff did not identify any specific location. Id. at 18:18–:23\n\n   (“So, during the course of our exam, I asked her, you know, is there a particular\n\n   place, you know, where do you feel the knot? And she couldn’t give me any specific\n\n   place. And when I asked her, she just, again, said, they’re all over. So basically\n\n   saying that both breasts felt sore and knots in them, not one specific knot.”).\n\nc) The Unity progress note for the plaintiff’s December 3, 2009 visit lists as the reason\n\n   for appointment as “1. Medical – Adult Est Patient 2. Sore, tender breasts 3. Knots in\n\n   them.” Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1013. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that the\n\n   individual who recorded the plaintiff’s “reason for appointment” was the medical\n\n   assistant with whom she was working on December 3, 2009. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n   3:17–:21. The progress note for the December 3, 2009, visit also contains Dr. Hill-\n\n   Daniel’s notes, which stated in pertinent part: “Patient presents for new complaint of\n\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f           breast tenderness and lumpiness. Pt states tender all the time denies pregnancy and\n\n           no change with menstrual cycle. Pt also concerned that breast are [sic] lumpy.”\n\n           Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Pl.’s Ex. 1 at 1013.\n\n2. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that her note “tender all the time” meant to her that the patient did\n\n   not feel pain that is waxing and waning. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 6:3–6 (“[I]t’s not waxing\n\n   and waning, the pain is not in the morning versus in the evening. She is specifically saying\n\n   that she feels uncomfortable all the time with the pain.”). She further interpreted her note,\n\n   “no change with menstrual cycle,” explaining this meant that there was no change in the\n\n   symptoms associated with the patient’s menstrual cycle, and her observation that the plaintiff\n\n   was menstruating during the time of the visit. Id. at 5:15–:21.\n\n3. The defendant disputes whether the plaintiff told Dr. Hill-Daniel or the medical assistant\n\n   about her family history of breast cancer, and whether Dr. Hill-Daniel asked the plaintiff\n\n   about her family history of breast cancer beyond her first-degree relatives.\n\n       a) The plaintiff testified emphatically that, at the December 3, 2009 appointment, she\n\n           told one of the health care providers with whom she spoke about her family history of\n\n           breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 79:13–:16 (“Q: And you mentioned that you\n\n           had discussion with Dr. Hill-Daniel about cancer. Would you describe for us what\n\n           the nature of the discussion was? A: I told her I had two grandmothers that had\n\n           breast cancer.”), 128:17–:18 (“Yes, I told them at Unity that I had a family history of\n\n           breast cancer.”), 129:5–:6 (“I told them numerous times when I was, when I seen the\n\n           nurse before I seen Dr. Hill-Daniel.”). Indeed, the plaintiff explained that the fact that\n\n           both her grandmothers suffered from breast cancer worried her when she felt a knot in\n\n\n\n\n                                                      24\n\f           her breast and is the reason that she made the appointment to see Dr. Hill-Daniel in\n\n           December 2009 and expressly requested a mammogram. Id. at 78:11–:16.\n\n       b) The note prepared by the medical assistant makes no mention of the plaintiff’s\n\n           grandmothers’ breast cancer. The progress report from the December 3, 2009\n\n           appointment prepared by Dr. Hill-Daniel states only that “Pt denies family hx of\n\n           breast ca in first degree relative.” Def.’s Ex. 1 at 8. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that the\n\n           first-degree relative is “a mother, sister, father.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 6:17. A\n\n           grandparent is a second degree relative. Id. at 7:14.\n\n       c) Although Dr. Hill-Daniel’s progress note indicates information only about cancer in a\n\n           “first-degree relative,” Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she recalls asking the plaintiff\n\n           more broadly whether she had any family history of breast cancer, to which the\n\n           plaintiff said “no.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 6:4–:5.\n\n4. Dr. Hill-Daniel performed a clinical breast exam on the plaintiff, which the plaintiff\n\n   described as “a quick pat-down,” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 79:4–:9; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n   9:16–:20, and found no abnormalities, Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 62:6–:9. Dr. Hill-Daniel did\n\n   not feel, or palpate, a mass in the plaintiff’s breast or her lymph nodes during the exam, nor\n\n   did she find any retractions. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at\n\n   58:7–:15. A retraction looks like a pucker in the skin, and can be a symptom of breast cancer\n\n   if the cancer is close to the skin. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 58:7–:15. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified\n\n   that she did not write down any differential diagnosis – the list of possible diagnoses – in the\n\n   progress note. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 15:1–16:7. Nevertheless, she testified that her top\n\n   two possible diagnoses were fibrocystic changes related to hormones and underwire bra. Id.\n\n   at 55:15–:17. The term “fibrocystic changes,” also called fibrocystic disease, means normal\n\n\n\n\n                                                     25\n\f   breast tissue that is tender and feels lumpy due to hormonal changes with a woman’s\n\n   menstrual cycle. Id. at 56:14–:17. Dr. Hill-Daniel acknowledged, however, that she did not\n\n   record “fibrocystic changes” as her diagnosis on the progress note; rather, she entered the\n\n   diagnostic code “breast disorder not otherwise specified.” Id. at 13:2–:22; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at\n\n   1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that breast cancer was not on her\n\n   differential diagnosis. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 55:11–:14.\n\n5. The plaintiff testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel told her that she was too young to have breast\n\n   cancer and too young for a mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 79:10–:19. Dr. Hill\n\n   Daniel denied telling the plaintiff that she was too young to have breast cancer, Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 58 at 14:18–:24, but acknowledged that she reassured the plaintiff that her concerns were\n\n   benign, id. at 13:21–:22. The progress note reflects that Dr. Hill-Daniel “reassured [the\n\n   plaintiff] about the benign nature of her concern” and determined that “no imaging [was]\n\n   warranted at this time.” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n   recommended that the plaintiff change her bra to non-underwire, and prescribed 800 mg of\n\n   Ibuprofen three times per day with one refill. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 14:5–:9.\n\n6. On the progress note, the letters “PRN,” which means “as needed,” are written under the title\n\n   “follow-up.” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 16:8–:9. Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel testified that she asked the plaintiff “to follow up if she didn’t have any relief of\n\n   the pain, or if her symptoms persisted.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 16:12–18. She did not\n\n   schedule or direct the plaintiff to return for a follow-up appointment within any specific time\n\n   frame. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 61:15–:23. The plaintiff testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel never\n\n   told her that she should follow-up under any circumstances. Id. at 20:22–21:7.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     26\n\f7. The standard of care experts disagreed as to what the national standard of care required Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel to do for a patient presenting with the plaintiff’s symptoms.\n\n       a) The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Sutherland, testified that when a patient presents\n\n           complaining of a knot in one breast and noncyclic pain, and with a family history of\n\n           two grandmothers with breast cancer, the national standard of care for a family care\n\n           doctor requires the doctor to order diagnostic imaging, even if the doctor does not\n\n           palpate a mass. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 47:12–:23. At the very least, the national\n\n           standard of care requires the doctor to schedule a follow-up visit for the patient thirty\n\n           to sixty days later to determine whether the symptoms persist and still warrant\n\n           imaging. Id. at 37:19–:24.\n\n       b) The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Margo, testified that when a patient presents complaining\n\n           of a palpable lump, tenderness and pain – even if the doctor does not feel a mass\n\n           herself – the national standard of care for a family care doctor requires the doctor to\n\n           include breast cancer in her differential diagnosis and schedule a follow-up visit for\n\n           the patient for four to six weeks later to ensure that the problem has gone away and to\n\n           reexamine the patient at a different stage in her menstrual cycle. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n           70 at 60:22–61:2 (“[T]he national standard required her to make sure she had a\n\n           follow-up visit to make sure the problem went away and that she informed the patient\n\n           of the possibility that this wasn’t benign, that maybe it probably was, but that we\n\n           can’t be sure until we follow it through.”), 61:15–62:3 (“Q: And what specific\n\n           follow-up was Dr. Hill-Daniel required to order? A: To make sure she had an\n\n           appointment to follow up in the next four to six weeks.”), 64:4–:8 (“[B]reast cancer\n\n           has to be on the diagnosis since that’s the most dangerous thing to miss.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    27\n\f   According to Dr. Margo, the national standard of care does not require the doctor\n\n   under those circumstances to order imaging before the follow-up visit. Id. at 62:24–\n\n   63:2.\n\nc) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified because the patient was a twenty-four\n\n   year old woman presenting with soreness and knots in both breasts, and upon\n\n   examination the physician felt no masses, but made “bilateral fibrocystic findings,”\n\n   Dr. Hill-Daniel met the national standard of care for a family practice physician by\n\n   prescribing pain medication and a different bra. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 22:9–:11,\n\n   30:14–:24. He testified that under those circumstances, the national standard of care\n\n   for a family practice physician does not require referral for imaging. Id. at 29:21–\n\n   30:5. He also testified that it would be inappropriate to list cancer on the differential\n\n   diagnosis because cancer would be “so far down on the list of probabilities.” Id. at\n\n   31:24–32:14.\n\nd) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Koch, testified that because the patient is a twenty-four\n\n   year old woman complaining of “sore, tender breasts, plural . . . and she feels knots in\n\n   them,” has no family history of breast cancer, and upon physical examination the\n\n   physician finds no masses, no retractions, and no lymph nodes, Dr. Hill-Daniel met\n\n   the national standard of care by advising the patient to change the type of bra she\n\n   wears, prescribing pain medication, and asking her to follow up if the problem does\n\n   not go away. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 77:9–79:3, 83:2–:18, 86:19–87:7. He testified\n\n   that under those circumstances, the national standard of care for a family practice\n\n   physician does not require referral for imaging. Id. at 80:1–:3, 85:10–86:17. He also\n\n   testified on cross-examination, in concurrence with the plaintiff’s experts, that it\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f            would violate the national standard of care for a physician under those circumstances\n\n            not to tell the patient to come back if the breast problems continue. Id. at 128:8–:17.\n\n            Moreover, in further concurrence with the plaintiff’s experts, Dr. Koch opined that if\n\n            a patient presents with bilateral tenderness in her breast and a discrete lump or knot,\n\n            and pain in one breast, and the physician could not feel the lump, the national\n\n            standard of care would require the physician to bring the patient back within six\n\n            weeks to three months for follow-up. Id. at 129:3–:25.\n\n       F.      THE PLAINTIFF’S MEDICAL HISTORY FROM JANUARY 2009 TO\n               AUGUST 2010\n\n1. The plaintiff returned to Unity on January 8, 2010 – thirty-six days after her December 3,\n\n   2009 visit – for an appointment with Dr. Hill-Daniel regarding fertility issues. Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   no. 58 at 19:12–:14, 20:8–:12; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1064; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 9. Dr. Hill-Daniel did not\n\n   ask the plaintiff about her breast symptoms during that visit or examine her breasts. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 21:7–:9, 71:25–72:11. The Ibuprofen prescribed by Dr. Hill-Daniel for the\n\n   plaintiff at the previous appointment appears on the progress note for the January 8, 2010\n\n   visit as a “current medication,” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1064; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 9, and Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n   testified that she was aware that the plaintiff was continuing to take the Ibuprofen. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 19:12–:14, 20:8–:12.\n\n2. The plaintiff returned to Unity again on April 30, 2010, for a check-up and for problems with\n\n   her eyes. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1062; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 11. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she did not\n\n   recall any conversation with the plaintiff about her breasts during that visit, Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 58 at 21:17–22:18, 48:17–:25. She also testified that during that visit, she did not\n\n   specifically ask the plaintiff if she was having problems with her breasts, Trial Tr. 53:17–:22,\n\n   although she testified from recollection that she did ask the plaintiff if she had any other\n\n\n\n                                                     29\n\f   issues or complaints, to which the plaintiff responded “no,” id. at 23:2–:4. The plaintiff’s\n\n   testimony confirmed that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not inquire about her breasts at this follow-up\n\n   visit: when asked if she recalled whether Dr. Hill-Daniel asked her if she was having any\n\n   problems with her breasts at the April 30, 2010 visit, the plaintiff responded, “no.” Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 55 at 83:15–:21.\n\n3. On May 19, 2010, the plaintiff was seen by an emergency physician, Dr. Carter, at Howard\n\n   University Hospital. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23061; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 68; Trial Tr. ECF No. 72\n\n   116:5–:11. The chief complaint as documented on the record for that visit is “knot on l[ef]t\n\n   breast,” Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23061; Def.’s Ex. 3. The medical history recorded by Dr. Carter\n\n   included “left breast tenderness for greater than a year,” and indicated that the pain was\n\n   “continual.” Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 69; Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 119:11–:12,\n\n   119:21–:24. Dr. Carter’s notes also state that he found no discharge from the nipple, no\n\n   warmth, and no redness – meaning no signs of infection. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s Ex.\n\n   3, at 69; Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 122:18–123:2. There is no indication in the notes that the\n\n   plaintiff had any ulcerations or skin nodules on her breasts. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s\n\n   Ex. 3, at 69. Dr. Carter testified that he palpated the plaintiff’s breasts and found tender cysts\n\n   in both breasts, with one large tender cyst in the left breast, and tenderness in both breasts.\n\n   Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 123:5–:8, 134:2–:5. Dr. Carter documented the results of the exam\n\n   with a diagram in the patient record. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 69. Dr. Carter\n\n   testified that he wrote, “Patient advised to follow up with primary care provider for full\n\n   evaluation, possible biopsy” in the plaintiff’s record, which means that he probably told the\n\n   plaintiff to see her primary care doctor and get a further workup. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at\n\n   123:7–:8, 124:1–:18; Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23062; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 69. He prescribed 800mg of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    30\n\f   Motrin and Tylenol with Codeine. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23065; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 72. The plaintiff\n\n   signed the discharge form and was given a copy to take home. Pl.’s Ex. 104, at 23065;\n\n   Def.’s Ex. 3, at 72; Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 135:12–:16. Among the “additional notes”\n\n   written on the discharge form was, “Follow up with your primary care doctor.” Pl.’s Ex.\n\n   104, at 23065; Def.’s Ex. 3, at 72. The plaintiff testified that she did not remember this visit\n\n   to Howard University Hospital. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 84:6–:8 (“Q: Do you recall going to\n\n   Howard University Hospital on May 19th, 2010? A: I don’t remember that visit.”); id. at\n\n   87:22–:25 (“The Court: Now, Ms. Rhodes, it’s clear from your responses to the last several\n\n   questions that you don’t have a memory of going to Howard on May 19th, 2010, right? A:\n\n   Right.”).\n\n4. On August 9, 2010, the plaintiff visited the emergency room at Fort Washington Hospital.\n\n   Pl.’s Ex. 6, at 6003. The patient record for the plaintiff’s visit, which was completed by a\n\n   health care provider, lists her complaint as “knot in left breast x 3 years.” Id. The plaintiff\n\n   testified that she went to Fort Washington because she “had soreness and tenderness in [her]\n\n   breast and pain and a knot in [her] left breast.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 89:21–:24. She\n\n   further testified that she did not recall telling anyone that the knots had been present for three\n\n   years, and that the knots had only been present since 2009. Id. at 89:21–:24, 90:6–:8.\n\n   According to the plaintiff, the emergency room doctors at Fort Washington Hospital told her\n\n   to set up an appointment with her primary care doctor for a mammogram because something\n\n   very serious was going on with her left breast. Id. at 90:12–:18. The discharge paper from\n\n   that visit lists the diagnosis as “left breast lumps,” and under “discharge instructions,” is\n\n   written, “you need f/u for further evaluation. Very important.” Pl.’s Ex. 6, at 6002, 6004.\n\n   The plaintiff testified that this was the first time that a doctor had told her to schedule an\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\f   appointment for a mammogram and that it was important to do so. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   91:22–:25.\n\n       G.       PLAINTIFF’S VISIT WITH DR. HILL-DANIEL ON OCTOBER 18, 2010\n\n1. On August 10, 2010 – the day after her visit to Fort Washington Hospital – the plaintiff\n\n   called Unity and asked for the first available appointment to see Dr. Hill-Daniel because she\n\n   needed a mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 92:1–:13. She was given an appointment for\n\n   September 9, 2010. Pl.’s Ex. 33. Unity cancelled that appointment shortly before it was\n\n   scheduled to take place because Dr. Hill-Daniel was scheduled to be on hospital rounds that\n\n   week. Pl.’s Ex. 33; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 25:2–:16, 107:21–22. Unity rescheduled the\n\n   appointment for September 24, 2010. Pl.’s Ex. 33. The September 24, 2010 appointment\n\n   was also cancelled by Unity. Pl.’s Ex. 33; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 25:2–19, 107:24–108:4.\n\n   Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that Unity cancelled the appointment on the day it was scheduled to\n\n   take place because she was called to the hospital. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 25:17–:19. Unity\n\n   rescheduled the appointment for October 18, 2010. Pl.’s Ex. 33. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified\n\n   that the plaintiff could have seen another doctor or come in to Unity as a walk-in patient if\n\n   she did not want to wait to see Dr. Hill-Daniel. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 25:25–26:15. The\n\n   defendant presented no evidence that the plaintiff was told that these options were available\n\n   to her at the time, nor did the defendant present any evidence that the personnel at Unity,\n\n   who spoke to the plaintiff about the original or the re-scheduled appointments, made any\n\n   inquiry about why the plaintiff was requesting an mammogram as soon as possible in order\n\n   to evaluate the urgency of the need for an appointment.\n\n2. The plaintiff was seen by Dr. Hill-Daniel on October 18, 2010, more than two months after\n\n   her initial call to Unity to schedule an appointment. Pl.’s Ex. 33. The Unity progress note\n\n\n\n\n                                                   32\n\f   for that appointment and Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony reflect that the plaintiff presented with a\n\n   “new complaint of bumps in her breast,” and that the plaintiff could feel bumps in her left\n\n   breast that had been getting bigger. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 24:15–:18.\n\n   The progress note also reflects that the plaintiff had been seen in the emergency room\n\n   regarding the bumps and that she was told to follow up with her doctor to get a referral for a\n\n   mammogram. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12; Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 24:18–:21. The plaintiff testified\n\n   that she showed the papers from Fort Washington Hospital to Dr. Hill-Daniel “for her\n\n   actually to believe me about what I was saying about my breasts . . . because they had seen\n\n   something on my breasts that she didn’t see, for me to get a mammogram.” Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 55 at 96:1–:10.\n\n3. At the October 18, 2010, visit, Dr. Hill-Daniel performed a breast exam and palpated\n\n   multiple nodules in the plaintiff’s left breast and an enlarged lymph node in her left axilla\n\n   (under her armpit). Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 27:10–:15; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n   also observed multiple scars on the left breast, some of which were overlying nodules. Trial\n\n   Tr. ECF No. 58 at 27:10–:13; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that an enlarged\n\n   lymph node can be a sign of infection or breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 27:16–:25.\n\n   She also testified that she was not sure if the plaintiff had an infection, abscess, or cancer, but\n\n   that she found no indication of any infection, such as drainage from the site, fever, or chills.\n\n   Id. 28:2–:4, 28:10–:13. The assessment or diagnosis that Dr. Hill-Daniel wrote on the\n\n   progress note was “breast neoplasm not otherwise specified.” Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12.\n\n4. Dr. Hill-Daniel ordered a referral for the plaintiff to get a breast ultrasound. Def.’s Ex. 1, at\n\n   12. The progress note for the October 18, 2010 appointment reflects a “follow up”\n\n   timeframe of six weeks. Id. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she “felt six weeks was enough\n\n\n\n\n                                                     33\n\f   time for [the plaintiff] to get the referral, make her appointments, get the exam done, and\n\n   report back to [her].” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:3–:5.\n\n5. The parties dispute whether Dr. Hill-Daniel discussed the urgency of obtaining an ultrasound\n\n   with the plaintiff.\n\n       a) Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she “basically stressed the importance of her to get the\n\n            study done and come back to me for the results so we could figure out what else we\n\n            needed to do.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:1–:3; see also id. at 95:16–:18 (“I told her\n\n            that she needed to get [the ultrasound] done. And I told her, because of this I’m\n\n            going to give you the referral now so you can go ahead and schedule.”), 95:22–:24 (“I\n\n            told her that I didn’t know what the mass was, that she needs to get the ultrasound\n\n            done so we could figure out what was going on.”).\n\n       b) When asked whether Dr. Hill-Daniel told her how quickly she was supposed to have\n\n            the ultrasound performed, the plaintiff testified that she did not discuss the ultrasound\n\n            with her. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 97:3–:6 (“She didn’t give me no discussion about\n\n            the ultrasound.”). There is no indication on the progress note that Dr. Hill-Daniel told\n\n            the plaintiff why she needed an ultrasound or with what urgency. The plaintiff\n\n            emphasizes that this is significant because when Dr. Hill-Daniel counseled the\n\n            plaintiff that her complaints were “benign” during the December 3, 2009, visit, she\n\n            documented the conversation on the progress note. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1,\n\n            at 8.\n\n       H.       UNITY’S REFERRAL PROCESS\n\n1. The plaintiff was insured by D.C. Chartered Health Plan (“D.C. Chartered”) for the entire\n\n   period of time relevant to this action. See Pl.’s Ex. 55 (D.C. Chartered Health Plan referral\n\n\n\n\n                                                     34\n\f   verifications for Shilisa Rhodes). D.C. Chartered requires Unity to obtain an insurance\n\n   authorization, called a “DIVA,” before a patient can receive a referral for an ultrasound or\n\n   mammogram at Providence Hospital. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:21–24, 30:18–:24;\n\n   Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 144:8–:10. Unity employs care management support persons to\n\n   process referrals and obtain authorizations. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 9:11. Terita Jones is the\n\n   care management support person who works with Dr. Hill-Daniel, as well as three other\n\n   doctors, to process over fifty referrals each day. Id. at 14:12–:17, 26:3–:8. Ms. Jones\n\n   testified that the doctors send referral forms to her electronically. Id. at 14:12–:17, 16:9–:23.\n\n   She then prints out the form, called the “Unity Physician Referral” form (“Referral”), calls\n\n   the insurance company, and inputs the referral information by following the prompts on the\n\n   telephone. Id. at 18:13–:22. She then enters the authorization code on the Referral\n\n   electronically, and D.C. Chartered faxes the DIVA to her. Id. at 16:9–:23. The patient needs\n\n   to present both the Referral and the DIVA at Providence Hospital to obtain an ultrasound or\n\n   mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 30:18–:24.\n\n2. The Referral and the DIVA contain two numeric codes: the ICD-9 and the CPT. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 72 at 143:13–:15, 143:20–:24. The ICD-9 code corresponds to the diagnosis given\n\n   to the patient. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 30:5–:13. The CPT code corresponds to the medical\n\n   procedure being ordered. Id. at 30:14–:16. The codes on the DIVA and the Referral must\n\n   match; if they don’t match, the patient cannot have the procedure. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at\n\n   151:19–:25. The referring doctor is responsible for choosing the correct codes. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 102:21–103:1.\n\n3. The patient must pick up the DIVA and referral from the care management support person,\n\n   who in this case was Ms. Jones, and bring those forms to Providence at the time of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    35\n\f   scheduled referred procedure. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 30:18–:24. Sometimes Unity\n\n   provides the patient with the DIVA and referral on the same day as the patient’s visit, and\n\n   sometimes the patient has to return to Unity a few days later to pick the forms up. Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 72 at 88:7–:11. The referring physician may mark a referral “urgent.” Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 58 at 44:25. In that case, the care management support person is supposed to take\n\n   the referral out of turn and work on it immediately to get the authorization, and provide the\n\n   patient with the forms quickly. Id. at 44:25–45:4. If the forms are prepared on a different\n\n   day than the patient’s visit with Unity, Ms. Jones calls the patient by phone to advise that the\n\n   forms are ready for pick-up. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 25:20–26:18. Ms. Jones does not\n\n   communicate with the patient about the urgency of the referred procedure and the scheduling\n\n   of the referred procedure with Providence or other health care facility remains the patient’s\n\n   responsibility. Id. at 27:2–:21, 88:7–:22.\n\n4. Marsha Williams, a Providence Hospital front desk registration clerk who schedules\n\n   appointments for diagnostic and screening mammograms and breast ultrasounds, testified\n\n   that in 2010, Providence Hospital kept a schedule of mammograms for up to a period of\n\n   ninety days into the future. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 156:11–:13. She also testified that the\n\n   scheduling clerk determines an available date for imaging studies, which depends upon the\n\n   urgency of the test. Id. at 144:11–:20. Ms. Williams testified that in 2010 and 2011,\n\n   ultrasounds were generally scheduled about a week out, mammograms about a day out, and\n\n   diagnostic mammograms, about two to three days out. Id. at 146:19–147:4. Ultrasounds\n\n   take longer to schedule because the technician works only 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., which\n\n   means that Providence is able to perform only five ultrasounds per day. Id. at 145:20–\n\n   146:11.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\f       I.     THE PLAINTIFF’S DIAGNOSTIC TESTS\n\n1. Dr. Hill-Daniel generated a referral for Ms. Jones to obtain an ultrasound at Providence\n\n   Hospital on the day of the plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 visit, and she asked Ms. Jones to\n\n   obtain the authorization so that the plaintiff could leave Unity with the Referral and DIVA\n\n   in-hand. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:8–:11; Def.’s Ex. 2, at 1. Ms. Jones was not instructed\n\n   to, and did not, tell the plaintiff anything about the urgency in making the ultrasound\n\n   appointment, how long she should take before making the appointment, or when the\n\n   appointment should be scheduled. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 67:7–:16. The Referral lists the\n\n   authorization end date for the ultrasound as January 16, 2011, or three months from the date\n\n   of the plaintiff’s October, 2010 visit. Id. at 68:6–:15. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 12. The Referral\n\n   allows the patient to make an appointment between the date of issuance and the referral\n\n   verification authorization end date. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 121; Pl.’s Ex. 55, at 55004; Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 72 at 67:17–68:5.\n\n2. Providence Hospital does not have a record of when the plaintiff called to schedule her\n\n   ultrasound appointment, but it is undisputed that the appointment was scheduled for\n\n   November 3, 2010, at 10:30 a.m. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1059; Def.’s Ex. 2, at 3. The plaintiff went\n\n   to Providence Hospital that morning, but she was unable to have the ultrasound because the\n\n   Referral contained an IDC-9 code, which had been provided by Dr. Hill-Daniel, that was\n\n   incorrect. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 103:2–:13; ECF No. 72 at 145:7–:11, 157:13–:14. Ms.\n\n   Williams testified that the IDC-9 code on the plaintiff’s Referral was “239.3,” which is an\n\n   unspecific diagnosis code that Providence Hospital does not use because it does not tell the\n\n   hospital exactly what is wrong with the patient. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 157:18–158:9. Ms.\n\n   Williams called Unity at 10:30 a.m. that day and spoke with Ms. Jones. Id. at 22:14–:23;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   37\n\f   Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1059. She told Ms. Jones that the plaintiff was at Providence Hospital, and that\n\n   the ICD-9 code needed to be changed for the plaintiff to get the ultrasound. Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 72 at 22:15–:16.\n\n3. Ms. Jones testified that she notified Dr. Hill-Daniel about the need for the code change by\n\n   sending her an electronic alert through the electronic records system, which signaled Dr.\n\n   Hill-Daniel that she had a message. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 23:13–24:3. The message\n\n   stated, “Patient is at appt ICD-9 code needs to be changed if you can please change code so\n\n   that pt can be seen her appt is at 10:30 tech person leaves at 11:00 am this is for mammo\n\n   procedure code should be 611.72.” Id. at 23:2–:10; Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1059. Ms. Jones also\n\n   testified that she went to Dr. Hill-Daniel’s office to tell her that about the electronic alert, but\n\n   Dr. Hill-Daniel was not in her office. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 24:4–:10, 25:4–:11. Dr. Hill-\n\n   Daniel changed the code at 12:37 p.m. and sent the Referral back to Ms. Jones. Id. at 24:11–\n\n   :18. Ms. Jones faxed the Referral and DIVA back to Providence sometime between 1:00\n\n   p.m. and 3:23 p.m. the same day. Id. at 29:15–30:8, 30:20–:25. By that time, however, the\n\n   technician at Providence Hospital had left for the day. Id. at 23:2–:10. After faxing the\n\n   referral and DIVA to Providence Hospital, Ms. Jones called the plaintiff and told her that the\n\n   Referral had been faxed to Providence Hospital and that she could pick up a copy from\n\n   Unity. Id. at 31:2–:16. Ms. Jones testified that it was necessary for the plaintiff to pick up\n\n   the Referral from Unity at that point because it had been faxed to Providence after 11:00 a.m.\n\n   Id. at 31:17–:21. The plaintiff picked up the referral the next day on November 4, 2010. Id.\n\n   at 34:4–:22.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      38\n\f4. The ultrasound was rescheduled for December 14, 2010, and was performed that day, almost\n\n   two full months after Dr. Hill-Daniel had palpated left breast lumps and an enlarged lymph\n\n   node. Pl.’s Ex. 13, at 1; Def.’s Ex. 5, at 1.\n\n5. The ultrasound report of December 14, 2010, describes the left breast as having a solid mass\n\n   at one o’clock, which corresponds to the palpable mass, small focal calcifications within the\n\n   mass, and small nodules in the breast tissues which correspond to dark skin lesions. Pl.’s Ex.\n\n   13, at 1; Def.’s Ex. 5, at 1. The report stated that “while the [large mass with calcifications]\n\n   may be a fibroadenoma, more aggressive lesion cannot be excluded.” Id. The radiologist\n\n   recommended a left mammogram and noted, “[u]nfortunately this exam cannot be authorized\n\n   at this time and needs to be scheduled.” Id. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she assumed the\n\n   radiologist meant that the plaintiff did not have the DIVA authorization necessary to perform\n\n   the recommended mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 39:22–40:4.\n\n6. Dr. Hill-Daniel received the ultrasound report in the mail almost two weeks later, on\n\n   December 27, 2010. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 41:7–8 She generated a referral for a\n\n   mammogram three days later, on December 30, 2010, sent it to Ms. Jones for authorization,\n\n   and asked Ms. Jones to call the plaintiff when it was ready. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 41:11–\n\n   :15. Although Dr. Hill-Daniel marked the Referral “urgent” on December 30, 2010 so the\n\n   authorization would be completed before the end of the day, the plaintiff was not notified that\n\n   it was ready for pick up until January 7, 2011, more than a week after Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n   approved the referral and more than three weeks after the ultrasound showed the possibility\n\n   of an “aggressive lesion.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 39:12–:25, 40:25–41:2.\n\n7. Ms. Jones did not receive the referral from Dr. Hill-Daniel until January 6, 2011, because she\n\n   had been on vacation from December 28, 2010 to January 5, 2011. Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at\n\n\n\n\n                                                    39\n\f     36:3–:12. On January 6, 2011, at 4:18 p.m., Ms. Jones tried to get the DIVA authorization,\n\n     but was unsuccessful because the CPT code used by Dr. Hill-Daniel was, again, wrong. Id.\n\n     at 36:9–:25, 37:1–:12. The code could not be changed at that time because Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\n     had already left for the day. Id. 36:23–37:9. Dr. Hill-Daniel corrected the code the following\n\n     day, January 7, 2011. Id. at 37:1–:12. The same day, the plaintiff was notified by phone that\n\n     the referral was ready to be picked up. Id. at 39:1–:7.\n\n8.   Dr. Hill-Daniel did not call the plaintiff or otherwise directly communicate with the plaintiff\n\n     about the mammogram referral. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 97:22–98:2, 99:10–:14. She did not\n\n     communicate the urgency of the need to get a mammogram to the plaintiff, did not tell Ms.\n\n     Jones to communicate the urgency to the plaintiff, and did not write anything on the\n\n     mammogram Referral that would indicate how quickly the mammogram should be done.\n\n     Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 98:3–99:9. The “urgent” notation that communicates the urgency of\n\n     processing the Referral to Ms. Jones does not appear on the forms that the patient receives.\n\n     Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 39:15–:25. Ms. Jones also did not communicate to the plaintiff about\n\n     the urgency of obtaining the mammogram. Id. at 40:18–:23. The Referral for the\n\n     mammogram listed the authorization end date as October 18, 2011, providing a nine-month\n\n     period to obtain the mammogram. Pl.’s Ex. 57, at 1061; Def.’s Ex. 2, at 5.\n\n9. The plaintiff received a mammogram at Providence Hospital on February 9, 2011. Trial Tr.\n\n     ECF No. 58 at 43:2–:5. The next day, on February 10, 2011, the radiologist called Dr. Hill-\n\n     Daniel and reported his concerns that the mammogram was highly suspicious for cancer and\n\n     recommended that Dr. Hill-Daniel send the plaintiff for a biopsy. Id. at 43:13–:22. Dr. Hill-\n\n     Daniel telephoned the plaintiff to let her know that she was generating a referral to a surgeon\n\n     so that the plaintiff could get a biopsy. Id. at 111:8–:10. Dr. Hill-Daniel referred the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                                      40\n\f   to Providence surgeon Mark Johnson, M.D. for the biopsy. Pl.’s Ex. 44, at 110:21–111:7;\n\n   Def.’s Ex. 2, at 6. Although Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she could have called the\n\n   Providence Hospital radiology department – where she had admitting privileges – to try to\n\n   get the plaintiff’s appointment moved up, Dr. Hill-Daniel did not contact Dr. Johnson or his\n\n   office to expedite the scheduling of the biopsy. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 116:8–117:4; Pl.’s\n\n   Ex. 44, at 110:21–111:17. Dr. Hill-Daniel generated the referral, and the plaintiff was\n\n   responsible for picking it up from the Unity clinic, calling Dr. Johnson’s office, and\n\n   scheduling the biopsy. Pl.’s Ex. 44, at 108:18–:22.\n\n10. The plaintiff saw Dr. Johnson in his office on March 2, 2011, for a consultation. Pl.’s Ex. 1,\n\n   at 1040; Def.’s Ex. 7. The breast biopsy was performed one week later, on March 8, 2011.\n\n   Pl.’s Ex. 3, at 3001; Def.’s Ex. 8, at 3001. The results of the breast biopsy indicated that the\n\n   mass in the plaintiff’s left breast was invasive ductal carcinoma. Pl.’s Ex. 3, at 3001; Def.’s\n\n   Ex. 8, at 3001.\n\n11. Both parties agree that when the plaintiff was diagnosed with breast cancer on March 8,\n\n   2011, she had advanced stage incurable breast cancer. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 333 (citing Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 55 at 111:7–:9). A PET scan performed on March 28, 2011 and a bone scan\n\n   performed on March 31, 2011 showed that the cancer had metastasized to bones in her right\n\n   shoulder and left scapula. Pl.’s Ex. 8 at 8097, Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 65:12–:16. Dr. Feigert\n\n   testified that the March PET scan showed that the cancer had metastasized to at least eight\n\n   different sites in her bones. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 30:6–:8. Plaintiff does not dispute this.\n\n   3rd FOF Table ¶ 374.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    41\n\f12. The experts dispute whether Dr. Hill-Daniel’s role in the five-month delay between the\n\n   plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 visit and her breast cancer diagnosis violated the applicable\n\n   standard of care.\n\n       a) The plaintiff’s experts, Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Margo, opined that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s\n\n           failure to expedite the diagnostic tests violated the national standard of care for a\n\n           family care doctor. Dr. Sutherland testified that in light of Dr. Hill-Daniel’s findings\n\n           during the plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 visit, the national standard of care required her\n\n           to ensure that the plaintiff got a diagnostic ultrasound within a week, Trial Tr. ECF\n\n           No. 69 at 54:2–:12, and to obtain a diagnosis within two to three weeks of the\n\n           October visit, id. at 54:19–55:5. He testified that it was Dr. Hill-Daniel’s\n\n           responsibility to keep track of the patient and follow-up herself, or ask her staff to\n\n           follow-up, if she did not receive the diagnostic test results within this time period. Id.\n\n           at 56:13–57:7. Dr. Margo opined that Dr. Hill-Daniel ordered the tests in the correct\n\n           order – ultrasound, then mammogram and, finally, biopsy – but that the national\n\n           standard of care required Dr. Hill-Daniel to ensure that the ultrasound was performed\n\n           within two weeks of the October visit, and that the final breast cancer diagnosis was\n\n           made within two to three weeks of the October visit. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 82:4–\n\n           83:5.\n\n       b) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not violate the\n\n           national standard of care by ordering an ultrasound, mammogram, and biopsy in that\n\n           progression. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 41:4–:13, 43:3–:9, 43:18–44:9. In response to\n\n           questions from the Court, however, Dr. Bethea testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s\n\n           detection of lymph node involvement was a “game-changer,” and that, with that\n\n\n\n\n                                                     42\n\f   finding, it was not appropriate to wait six weeks before an ultrasound was performed.\n\n   Id. at 40:24–41:4. He also testified that “if you have an isolated lesion and an axillary\n\n   node, you can skip both [the ultrasound and mammogram] and go straight to biopsy\n\n   and be well in the standard of care.” Id. at 42:5–:8.\n\nc) Notably, while the progression of diagnostic tests may have been satisfactory, Dr.\n\n   Bethea was not so sanguine about the timing of the diagnostic tests in this case. Dr.\n\n   Bethea testified that the timing of the tests did not satisfy “best practices,” which is\n\n   the standard of care that he conforms to as a physician. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at\n\n   45:15–:17 (“If we were speaking best practice, I would not be here defending this\n\n   situation.”). Nonetheless, by drawing a distinction between “best practices” and “the\n\n   national standard of care,” Dr. Bethea testified that the timing of the tests did satisfy\n\n   the standard of care, which he defined as taking into consideration the circumstances\n\n   under which the care is delivered. Id. at 45:4–:10 (“The standard of care, as I said\n\n   earlier, is what a patient has the right to expect under the circumstances in which it’s\n\n   delivered. There are very different sets of circumstances within the medical world,\n\n   and it’s becoming more and more different as time goes on, unfortunately.”); 46:19–\n\n   :23 (“These days, unfortunately, doctors lose control of the situation in big medical\n\n   centers, such as where this occurred. They don’t lose control of it in a practice like\n\n   mine. So it’s two entirely different circumstances.”); 47:5–:11 (“So there are all sorts\n\n   of situations, medical, political, insurance, money. The whole situation is changing\n\n   the approach, in my opinion, much for the worse. This is a good example of that. So\n\n   you can be within the standard of care, as I think this situation was, but be far outside\n\n   the best practice model.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f       d) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Koch, testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel satisfied the national\n\n           standard of care on October 18, 2010, by prescribing a six-week follow-up period for\n\n           the plaintiff to obtain an ultrasound. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 101:25–102:7. He\n\n           testified that the plaintiff’s failure to follow up within that timeframe was her\n\n           responsibility. See id. at 105:17–:22. He also testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel acted\n\n           within the national standard of care by ordering an ultrasound, mammogram, and\n\n           biopsy in that order, id. at 103:19–104:8, and that the physician had no responsibility\n\n           to act to expedite the plaintiff’s appointments for diagnostic tests, id. at 110:22–\n\n           111:20 (“The national standard of care, in its basic tenet, is that if you find something\n\n           and you give the patient an order to get it and give the instructions of the phone\n\n           number and how to get it, then it becomes the patient’s responsibility to follow\n\n           through and get the test done.”). He did concede, however, that “there’s certainly an\n\n           obligation on a physician’s part to impart some need to expedite things.” Id. at\n\n           113:2–:3.\n\n13. After her breast cancer diagnosis, the plaintiff had a series of imaging studies and scans,\n\n   including CT scans of her brain on March 24, 2011 and February 1, 2012, Pl.’s Ex. 15, 25; a\n\n   CT scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis on March 24, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 16; PET/CT scans\n\n   on March 28, 2011, April 3, 2011, and September 17, 2012, Pl.’s Ex. 17, 19, 28; a whole\n\n   body bone scan on March 31, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 18; MRIs of the pelvis on May 12, 2011, and\n\n   July 15, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 21, 23; an MRI of both breasts on April 4, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 20; an MRI\n\n   of the thoracic spine and lumbar spine on May 28, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 22; a CT scan of the thorax\n\n   on July 18, 2011, Pl.’s Ex. 24; and a CT scan of her neck on February 1, 2012, Pl.’s Ex. 26.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     44\n\f14. Ms. Rhodes’s cancer treatment began on March 25, 2011, when she began receiving\n\n   hormone therapy with the drug Tamoxifen. Pl.’s Ex. 8, at 8098.\n\n       J.      THE PROGRESSION OF THE PLAINTIFF’S BREAST CANCER\n\n1. The parties agree that the plaintiff has both ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal\n\n   carcinoma. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 339 (citing Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 17:5–:9). The plaintiff’s\n\n   expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that only invasive ductal carcinoma is used for staging because it\n\n   is the only type of breast cancer that invades into adjacent cells and the only part that is\n\n   potentially lethal. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 18:24–:25. The natural tendency of breast cancer\n\n   when it becomes invasive is to migrate to lymph nodes and then to distant metastatic sites.\n\n   Id. at 20:24–21:1.\n\n2. The parties also agree that staging of cancer is important to define the patient’s prognosis and\n\n   treatment options. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 28:20–25. The staging convention used for breast\n\n   cancer in the United States is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (“AJCC”) Staging\n\n   Protocol. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 337 (citing Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:10–:12). Under that\n\n   protocol, there are four stages of breast cancer, with Stage I being the least severe and Stage\n\n   IV being the most severe. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:13–:14. The size and extent of the\n\n   invasive component is what is relevant to staging. Id. at 19:21–:23. If invasive breast cancer\n\n   goes untreated, it will eventually evolve from Stage I to Stage IV. Id. at 20:20–:22. AJCC\n\n   stage is the single most important predictor of outcome. Id. at 21:24–:25.\n\n3. The stage of a patient’s cancer is determined by three characteristics, called the “TNM\n\n   classification.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:15–:18; Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 28:9–:14. T\n\n   stands for the tumor size and extent within the breast; N stands for lymph node involvement;\n\n   and M stands for distant metastases, meaning the spread of the cancer into other areas, such\n\n\n\n\n                                                     45\n\f   as bone, brain, lung, liver, etc. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:17–:22. Stage I denotes a small\n\n   tumor size (T1 to T2), no lymph node involvement (N0), and no metastatic disease (M0). Id.\n\n   at 13:13–:18. Stage II denotes a bigger tumor size (T1, T2, or T3), possible early lymph\n\n   node metastasis, but confined to just a few lymph nodes (N1), and no evidence of metastatic\n\n   disease (M0). Id. at 13:19–:23. Stage III denotes any size tumor (T1, T2, T3, or T4), greater\n\n   nodal involvement, meaning more lymph nodes involved and bulkier lymph nodes, but no\n\n   metastatic disease (M0). Id. at 14:8–:12. When the cancer tumor has invaded the skin, the\n\n   cancer is defined as T4, which is at least Stage III. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 39:4–:5. Finally,\n\n   Stage IV is defined by the presence of metastatic disease (M1). Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   14:13–:16. The experts also agreed that breast cancers have a relatively uniform growth rate.\n\n   Id. at 31:22–:23.\n\n4. Both parties agree that when the plaintiff was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2011,\n\n   she had advanced stage incurable breast cancer. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 333 (citing Trial Tr. ECF\n\n   No. 55 at 11:7–:9). They disagree, however, about how and when her cancer progressed\n\n   through the stages.\n\n       General Progression\n\n5. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, opined that the plaintiff progressed from Stage I cancer by\n\n   first developing lymph node metastases, and then subsequently developing distant\n\n   metastases. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 47:18–:22. That is a representative progression in\n\n   patients with invasive duct carcinoma and it is the progression seen in the great majority of\n\n   patients. Id. at 47:18–:23. According to Dr. Tucker, based upon this progression, the\n\n   plaintiff’s breast cancer was curable in December 2009, and progressed to advanced stage\n\n   incurable cancer before March 2011, id. at 11:6–:9 (Dr. Tucker’s testimony that “it is my\n\n\n\n\n                                                   46\n\f    opinion that the breast cancer was curable in December of 2009, but by the time March 2011\n\n    had arrived, it was advanced stage, which meant that it was incurable at that point in time”).\n\n6. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, testified that by December 2009, the plaintiff already\n\n    had Stage III or, more likely, Stage IV incurable breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at\n\n    30:13–:18.\n\n         Stage of cancer in December 2009\n\n7. Dr. Tucker testified that in his opinion, in December 2009, the plaintiff had Stage I cancer\n\n    with a T value of 1, an N value of 0, and an M value of 0. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 32:5–:20,\n\n    44:15–:18, 45:11–:14.\n\n         a) To discern the T value, Dr. Tucker estimated the size of the plaintiff’s tumor in\n\n             December 2009. Since no imaging studies of the plaintiff’s breasts were done at that\n\n             time, he extrapolated from measurements of her tumor size that were taken in\n\n             December 2010 and March 2011. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 33:18–34:12. The\n\n             December 2010 measurement (1.9 centimeters) was taken from the plaintiff’s\n\n             December 14, 2010 ultrasound, and the March 2011 measurements were taken from\n\n             the March 24, 2011 CT scan (2.8 centimeters) and a March 28, 2011 PET CT scan\n\n             (2.6 centimeters). 9 Id. Dr. Tucker considered each of these tests to be reliable tools\n\n             for measuring tumor size. Id. at 33:18–34:12. Dr. Tucker plotted the size of the\n\n             tumor at the times of the ultrasound, the CT scan, and the PET CT scan on a graph\n\n             with time on one axis and tumor size on the other. Id. at 34:13–:19. Then, because\n\n             cancer has a relatively constant growth rate – a characteristic that both parties\n\n             acknowledge, see 3rd FOF Table ¶ 353 –, he drew a straight line connecting the three\n\n9\n Dr. Tucker explained the .2 centimeter difference between the March 24, 2011 measurement and the March 28,\n2011 measurement as a result of the fact that tumors are not spherical and just a slight rotation of the body can cause\nsmall incremental changes in imaging size. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 34:7–:12.\n\n\n                                                              47\n\f           data points and extending on both ends. According to Dr. Tucker, the point on the\n\n           line that corresponded with December 2009 also corresponded to a tumor size of\n\n           approximately one half to one centimeter. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 34:13–:21.\n\n           Because Dr. Tucker considered the tumor to be fast growing – a characterization\n\n           about which the defendant’s expert disagrees – he opined that the tumor was\n\n           nominally around one centimeter at its greatest dimension in December 2009 and well\n\n           under the two centimeter ceiling for the AJCC T1 category. Id. at 35:1–:6.\n\n       b) Dr. Tucker opined that in December 2009, the plaintiff’s cancer had an N value of 0\n\n           because: (1) he found no evidence of nodal metastatic disease in the records of the\n\n           plaintiff’s December 2009 appointment; and (2) the incidence of lymph node\n\n           metastasis in a patient with a one or two centimeter tumor is low. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n           55 at 44:17–45:10.\n\n       c) Dr. Tucker further opined that in December 2009, the plaintiff cancer had an M value\n\n           of 0 because: (1) if the plaintiff had metastatic disease in December 2009, she likely\n\n           would not be alive today; (2) the plaintiff had a high growth rate cancer; and (3) the\n\n           plaintiff would have developed symptoms of metastases, such as pain, dizziness,\n\n           headaches, seizure, or liver disease, in the fifteen-month period before her December\n\n           2009 appointment and when her cancer was finally diagnosed. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55\n\n           at 45:17–46:20.\n\n8. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, opined that by December 2009, the plaintiff already had\n\n   Stage III or, more likely, Stage IV incurable breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 30:13–\n\n   :18. Dr. Feigert described the following grounds for his opinion: (1) the extent of the cancer\n\n   that was discovered sixteen months later on an MRI; (2) the slow to average growth rate of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    48\n\fthe tumor, as evidenced by the tumor’s average mitotic rate and low Ki-67 value, and (3) the\n\nfavorable genetic profile of the cancer as hormonal receptor positive, HER2 negative. Dr.\n\nFeigert testified that the plaintiff’s April 4, 2011 MRI report showed a tumor over ten\n\ncentimeters in size and “very extensive involvement of the plaintiff’s skin with cancer over a\n\nvery large portion of the breast.” Id. at 31:22–32:5, 34:2–:20, 37:8–:13, 38:9–:10. Dr.\n\nFeigert testified that the radiologist’s report describes “generalized advanced thickening of\n\nthe skin” over the entire breast, which is visible on the MRI image. Id. at 34:12–:20. He\n\nviewed as significant the radiologist’s notations in the report of “evidence of extensive\n\ncarcinoma of the breast is noted with skin invasion” and “immediately direct extension into\n\nthe skin is felt to be present superiorly.” Id. at 35:1:10, 36:23–37:7. Dr. Feigert testified that\n\nsince no imaging of the plaintiff’s breast from December 2009 exists, he had to work\n\nbackward from the imaging that was available. Id. at 37:19–38:6. Due to the extensive\n\nnature of the skin involvement in April 2011, Dr. Feigert opined that it was “exceedingly\n\nlikely that there would have been at least one cancerous cell in the skin” in December 2009.\n\nId. at 38:6–:22. Dr. Feigert also pointed to (1) Dr. Hill-Daniel’s note in the plaintiff’s\n\nprogress note of October 18, 2010, identifying “multiple scars on left breast with some\n\noverlying nodules”; (2) the note on the report from the plaintiff’s December 14, 2010\n\nultrasound, stating “sub centimeter nodules in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast\n\ncorrespond to skin lesions,” as evidence of the extent of skin involvement. Id. at 40:7–41:20.\n\nAccording to Dr. Feigert, since even a single cancer cell in the skin makes the patient a Stage\n\nIII-B, T4, the plaintiff likely had at least Stage III-B cancer in December 2009. Id. at 38:15–\n\n:22 (“[A]ll you need is a single cancer cell in the skin, as of December of ’09 to make this\n\npatient a Stage III-B, the T4, with skin invasion. That’s why I wanted to demonstrate on this\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f   MRI how extensive it was in April of ’11 to make a rational argument that there would have\n\n   certainly been at least a microscopic and in my opinion macroscopic disease in the skin 16\n\n   months earlier.”). Dr. Feigert testified that the misdiagnosis of a Stage III or Stage IV cancer\n\n   as Stage I is “all too common.” Id. at 49:4–50:1 (“[I]n hindsight the explanation for why the\n\n   cancer comes back is there must have been metastases before the surgery.”).\n\n9. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Pushkas, testified that in his opinion, the plaintiff had Stage I\n\n   breast cancer in December 2009. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 67:22–68:2. He testified that T4\n\n   tumors are tumors that extend directly into the skin or chest wall and cause ulcerations and\n\n   nodules on the skin. Id. at 80:13–:14. He also testified that these ulcerations or nodules are\n\n   usually visible or, if not, there may be confounding skin abnormalities. Id. at 80:18–:23. Dr.\n\n   Pushkas testified that there was no indication in Dr. Hill-Daniel’s notes from the plaintiff’s\n\n   December 2009 or October 2010 visits, or in the notes from the plaintiff’s visits to Howard\n\n   University or Fort Washington Medical Center, that would suggest direct extension of the\n\n   cancer into the skin by ulceration or visible nodules on the skin. Id. at 81:3–:13. He further\n\n   testified that he saw no evidence in any of those medical records between December 2009\n\n   and the end of 2010 that would suggest T4 cancer. Id. at 81:14–82:9.\n\n       Progression of cancer after December 2009\n\n10. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that, in his opinion, the cancer progressed from\n\n   Stage I to Stage II, meaning the plaintiff developed lymph node metastases, sometime\n\n   between July and November 2010. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 47:24–48:11. Dr. Tucker also\n\n   testified that the cancer progressed to Stage IV sometime between December 2010 and\n\n   February 2011. Dr. Tucker relied on the extent of the distant metastasis shown on the March\n\n   24, 2011, PET CT scan and a subsequent technetium 99 scan. Id. at 49:20–50:5. According\n\n\n\n\n                                                     50\n\f   to Dr. Tucker, the metastatic disease was distributed among bony sites, but the sites were few\n\n   in number and there was no evidence of visceral involvement (brain, lungs, liver, or other\n\n   body sites). Id. at 50:10–:15. Metastases take time to develop, but how long this takes is a\n\n   function of the cancer’s growth rate. Id. at 50:16–23. Based on his opinion that the\n\n   plaintiff’s cancer has a high growth rate and the extent of the metastases in March 2011, Dr.\n\n   Tucker calculated that the plaintiff’s cancer would have metastasized distantly between July\n\n   and November 2010. Id. at 48:1–:3.\n\n11. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Pushkas, opined that the plaintiff’s disease probably became Stage\n\n   II disease during the summer of 2010, probably in July or August. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at\n\n   74:23–:24. The grounds for his opinion were that no lymph nodes were felt in December of\n\n   2009, but they were easily palpable ten months later, in October 2010, and showed on the\n\n   later imaging studies, and that lymph node involvement is dependent on the size of the\n\n   primary tumor. Id. 74:20–75:16.\n\n12. Dr. Bowers, the diagnostic radiologist who interpreted the plaintiff’s pelvis MRIs from May\n\n   12, 2011 and July 15, 2011, and who wrote the corresponding reports, testified that the May\n\n   12, 2011, MRI showed three early metastatic lesions. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 53:16–:25.\n\n   These pelvis lesions were not present on the March 2011 CT scan nor was abnormal activity\n\n   in those areas reflected on the bone scan conducted on March 31, 2011. Id. at 54:5–:15.\n\n   Accordingly, he testified that he considered the metastatic lesions to be new as of May 2011.\n\n   Id. at 54:16–:18. On the report, he wrote that his impression was “several lesions . . . that are\n\n   suspicious for early bony metastatic disease.” Pl.’s Ex. 21.\n\n13. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, agreed with the plaintiff’s experts that by March 31,\n\n   2011, the plaintiff’s cancer had metastasized into the bone, Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 65:4–:6,\n\n\n\n\n                                                    51\n\f   65:12–:16, based on his opinion that her cancer was already at a Stage III-B or IV by\n\n   December 2009, id. at 67:18–68:12.\n\n       The growth rate of the plaintiff’s cancer\n\n14. Both parties agree that the growth rate of a cancer will contribute to stage progression. Trial\n\n   Tr. ECF No. 55 at 24:6–:7. The parties’ experts disagreed, however, about the growth rate of\n\n   the plaintiff’s cancer. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that the plaintiff’s cancer is\n\n   fast growing, id. at 46:9–:10, whereas the defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, testified that it has\n\n   an average to slow growth rate, Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 93:3–:6.\n\n15. Dr. Tucker and Dr. Feigert agreed that breast cancer’s histopathological grade provides\n\n   useful prognostic information that helps with treatment decisions. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   22:2; Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 46:23–:25, 48:4–:6. The grading of breast cancer is correlated\n\n   to the aggressiveness of the cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 46:23–:25, 48:4–:6. The grading\n\n   system endorsed by the AJCC is the Scarff Bloom Richardson System (also referred to as the\n\n   Nottingham grading scheme), which has three grades. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 22:8–:13,\n\n   71:23–72:1. The grade of the cancer is determined by measuring three characteristics of the\n\n   cancer cells under a microscope: the tubules, the atypia, and the mitotic rate. Id. at 24:11–\n\n   25:5. The tubule component describes how well the cancer makes small ducts that give the\n\n   tumor its origin. Id. at 24:12–:14. The atypia component describes how typical the nucleus\n\n   of the cancer cell is. Id. at 24:14–:19. The mitotic rate component describes the number of\n\n   cells in the process of dividing. Id. at 24:19–:22. Each of these components is scored on a\n\n   scale of one to three, and the sum of the scores determines the grade. Id. at 24:22–25:5. A\n\n   total score of three, four, or five equals a grade one; a total score of six or seven equals a\n\n\n\n\n                                                     52\n\f   grade two; and a total score of eight or nine equals a grade three. Id. at 25:6–:13. The higher\n\n   the grade, the more aggressive the tumor. Id. at 24:6–:9; Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 46:23–:25.\n\n16. The treating pathologists at Providence Hospital graded the plaintiff’s tumor as a grade three,\n\n   or the most aggressive type of tumor. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 78:19–:23. This grade was\n\n   calculated from a tubule score of 3, an atypia score of 3 and a mitotic rate score of 2. Def.’s\n\n   Ex. 8, at 3001; Pl.’s Ex. 3, at 3001.\n\n17. The experts disagreed about the importance of the grade for describing the cancer’s growth\n\n   rate, the independent significance of each of the individual component scores, and the\n\n   importance of certain other indicators for predicting the growth rate of the cancer.\n\n       a) The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that the grade is the second most\n\n           important predictor of outcome with breast cancer and that the higher the grade of the\n\n           cancer, the faster the growth. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 22:2, 23:24–24:5. According\n\n           to Dr. Tucker, because the plaintiff’s cancer is grade three, the plaintiff’s breast\n\n           cancer has a high growth rate. Id. at 32:2–:3. Dr. Tucker also testified that all three\n\n           characteristics (tubules, atypia, and mitotic rate) are necessary to determine the\n\n           growth rate of the cancer and no individual component of the grade is a significant\n\n           predictor of the cancer’s growth rate on its own. Id. at 25:14–:25. Dr. Tucker\n\n           testified that the level of Ki-67 – a “proliferation marker” that measures expression of\n\n           synthesizing DNA – cannot be used to predict tumor growth rate. Id. at 63:12–:22\n\n           (use of Ki-67 to measure the growth rate of a tumor is a “misuse of the marker.”).\n\n       b) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, testified that the grade of the cancer is a measure\n\n           of its aggressiveness, which is distinct from growth rate. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at\n\n           92:18–:21 (“[W]e often see aggression correlating with growth rate, but not always.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     53\n\f            Aggression could be a slow growing cancer that is invading into the tissues. So as\n\n            medical oncologists we distinguish the two.”). According to Dr. Feigert, while the\n\n            plaintiff’s cancer is aggressive, it is not particularly fast growing. Id. at 46:22–48:8,\n\n            52:20–:22, 53:10–:12. Dr. Feigert also testified that the part of the grading system\n\n            that indicates the cancer’s growth rate is the mitotic rate because it reflects how fast\n\n            the cells are dividing. Id. at 46:22–47:14. The plaintiff’s mitotic rate was determined\n\n            by the physicians at Providence Hospital to be a two out of three. Id. at 79:11–:12.\n\n            According to Dr. Feigert, that level indicates that while the plaintiff’s tumor is\n\n            aggressive, its growth rate is average. Id. at 79:11–:13. Dr. Feigert also testified that\n\n            the level of Ki-67 is a predictor of tumor growth rate and that the plaintiff’s Ki-67\n\n            value indicates a slow-growing cancer. Id. at 75:15–:19, 77:14–:19, 79:11–:12. Dr.\n\n            Feigert acknowledged, however, that the Ki-67 level was developed to predict the\n\n            responsiveness of a cancer to particular treatment options. Id. at 76:4–:10. He further\n\n            acknowledged that the AJCC has rejected the incorporation of proliferation markers\n\n            such as Ki-67 into its staging system, and that the Ki-67 level does not seem to\n\n            reliably predict prognosis. Id. at 76:11–77:4. Dr. Feigert attempted to bolster his\n\n            description of the plaintiff’s cancer by noting that the genetic profile of her cancer,\n\n            Luminal A, suggests a relatively slow growth rate. Id. at 63:18–:24.\n\n       K.      Breast cancer prognoses\n\n1. The parties agree on the basic probabilities of survival at the various stages of breast cancer.\n\n   Dr. Pushkas testified that the SEER Survival Monograph on Breast Cancer (“SEER\n\n   database”) is a reliable and authoritative source for determining the probability of survival\n\n   from breast cancer in its various stages, Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 63:5–:19, which the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      54\n\f   defendant does not dispute, 3rd FOF Table ¶ 390. The SEER database represents a\n\n   compilation of data from over 300,000 cases reported from all over the United States. Trial\n\n   Tr. ECF No. 56 at 62:17–:21, 63:13–:19. According to the SEER Survival Monograph, the\n\n   average overall survival for Stage I breast cancer is ninety-eight percent, id. at 77:14–:16; the\n\n   average ten-year survival for Stage II breast cancer is in the low- to mid-seventy percent\n\n   range, id. at 78:7–:13, and the five-year survival for Stage IV breast cancer is fiteen percent,\n\n   id. at 83:5–84:1.\n\n2. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Pushkas, testified that in his opinion, given what he knows about\n\n   the plaintiff and the nature of her cancer, the plaintiff would have had a ninety-eight percent\n\n   survival rate when her cancer was Stage I, Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 77:22–78:6, and a seventy\n\n   percent ten-year survival when her cancer was Stage II, id. at 78:14–:23. If the plaintiff’s\n\n   breast cancer had been diagnosed at Stage I or Stage II, there is a substantial probability that\n\n   her cancer would have been cured. Id. at 79:5–:13.\n\n3. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Tucker, testified that the cure rate for Stage I breast cancer is\n\n   eighty to eighty-five percent over five years, and for Stage II breast cancer is over fifty\n\n   percent, Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 49:11–:13. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Feigert, testified that\n\n   the chance of survival for a patient with Stage III-B or Stage IV breast cancer is less than\n\n   fifty percent. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 61:24–:25.\n\n       L.      The plaintiff’s medical treatment\n\n1. Dr. Yoo, the plaintiff’s oncologist since January 30, 2012, Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 20:20–:21,\n\n   testified that since her diagnosis, the plaintiff has undergone hormone treatment,\n\n   chemotherapy, mastectomy, and radiation therapy, and has been medically induced into\n\n   menopause. Pl.’s Ex. 8, at 8113–14. Her treatment began with hormone therapy, using a\n\n\n\n\n                                                      55\n\f   drug called Tamoxifen, from March 25, 2011 to April 12, 2011, followed by neoadjuvant\n\n   chemotherapy until July 2011. Pl.’s Ex. 8 at 8098. A CAT scan taken at that time showed\n\n   that the mass in the plaintiff’s breast mass had significantly decreased with the\n\n   chemotherapy. Id. The plaintiff underwent a mastectomy of her left breast at Providence\n\n   Hospital on September 13, 2011. Id. The plaintiff’s treatments have been modified\n\n   numerous times since then based on the changing nature of her reactions and the cancer’s\n\n   reactions to them. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 27:24–34:9. Since the plaintiff’s cancer is\n\n   incurable, her treatment has been palliative and directed to pain management. Id. at 28:20–\n\n   :25, 34:13–:20. At some time in the future, no more treatments will be available to the\n\n   plaintiff. Id. at 34:10–:16.\n\n2. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Pushkas, opined that if the plaintiff’s breast cancer had been\n\n   diagnosed sometime between December 2009 and mid-February 2010, her course of\n\n   treatment would have been different. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 71:22–72:12. In his opinion,\n\n   an imaging study would have showed an abnormal finding. Id. at 72:5. The physician then\n\n   would have ordered a biopsy for tissue confirmation. Id. at 72:5–:9. Once the biopsy\n\n   revealed cancer, she would have been evaluated for the metastatic disease spread elsewhere\n\n   in the body, which in Dr. Pushkas’s opinion would not have been found. Id. at 72:10–:13.\n\n   Next, the plaintiff would have undergone a mastectomy to remove the breast and the lymph\n\n   nodes in the armpit. Id. at 72:12–:20. In light of his opinion that the cancer would not have\n\n   spread to the lymph nodes by that time, the plaintiff would have been treated either with\n\n   hormone treatment alone – because her cancer has been shown to be hormone dependent for\n\n   its growth – or chemotherapy. Id. at 72:21–73:12. Due to the plaintiff’s young age at the\n\n   time, Dr. Pushkas would have recommended a twenty-four week course of chemotherapy\n\n\n\n\n                                                    56\n\f   instead of hormone treatment. Id. at 73:2–12. He opined that this course of treatment would\n\n   have cured the plaintiff of cancer, with only repeated examinations as the necessary follow-\n\n   up. Id. at 73:11–:12.\n\n3. Dr. Pushkas also testified that if the plaintiff’s breast cancer had been diagnosed at or around\n\n   when she was Stage II, the treatment protocol would have been largely the same as the\n\n   treatment he recommended at Stage I. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 76:4–:10. The only\n\n   difference, in his opinion, is that if the plaintiff had ten or more involved lymph nodes in the\n\n   armpit, a radiotherapist would have recommended radiation treatment after the mastectomy.\n\n   Id. at 76:9–:15. In Dr. Pushkas’s opinion, however, the plaintiff would not have had more\n\n   than ten involved lymph nodes in the armpit. Id. at 76:18–:5, 77:24–78:5.\n\n4. The opinions of the pathology and oncology expert witnesses, as well as the plaintiff’s\n\n   treating oncologist, regarding the stage of, prognosis of, and recommended treatment for, the\n\n   plaintiff’s breast cancer at the times of the alleged acts of negligence by Dr. Hill-Daniel and\n\n   Unity are summarized by the Court in the following chart:\n\n\n\n\n                                                    57\n\f  Time of    Corresponding Event            Witness             Cancer        Prognosis        Recommended\n Diagnosis                                                       Stage                           Course of\n                                                                                                Treatment\nDecember     The plaintiff visits Dr.      Dr. Tucker          Stage I        80-85% cure\n2009–April   Hill-Daniel three times:      (Plaintiff’s                       rate over five\n                                           expert)                            years\n2010         -December 3, 2009, for her    Dr. Pushkas         Stage I        98% survival.

The Plaintiff’s Economic Damages\n\n1. Through expert witnesses, both parties presented an estimate of the economic damages the\n\n   plaintiff incurred as a result of the delayed diagnosis of her breast cancer. Pl.’s Exs. 31, 53,\n\n   54; Def.’s Exs. 36, 37. Both parties’ economic expert witnesses analyzed the economic\n\n   losses the plaintiff would be expected to incur from loss of wages, loss of household services,\n\n   and the cost of future care. See id.\n\n       a) The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Lurito, assumed the plaintiff would work until retirement at\n\n            age sixty-five, based on the information he had been given regarding the plaintiff’s\n\n            intentions. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 13:13–:16. He conservatively assumed that the\n\n            plaintiff’s wages would be static, increasing only to keep pace with inflation,\n\n            throughout that entire period. Id. at 14:9–:14. Dr. Lurito applied a 3.5 percent after-\n\n            tax discount rate to his estimates of the plaintiff’s lost future wages. Id. at 17:19–:21.\n\n            The discount rate Dr. Lurito used took into account the amount of interest the plaintiff\n\n            could earn on the lump sum of wages provided so as not to overcompensate the\n\n            plaintiff. Id. at 16:16–22; 17:5–:7. Dr. Lurito did not deduct any personal\n\n            maintenance or consumption costs from his estimate because the plaintiff is still alive.\n\n            Id. at 19:18–:24. Based on these calculations, Dr. Lurito opined the plaintiff’s lost\n\n            wages amount to $737,715. Id. at 15:21–:23.\n\n       b) The defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, agreed with one of the plaintiff’s expert’s\n\n            assumptions, namely, that the plaintiff’s wages would remain static, adjusted for\n\n            inflation, over her lifetime. Def.’s Ex. 36 at 15:3–8. She differed in three other\n\n            assumptions, however. First, Dr. Hurdle assumed a shorter length of the plaintiff’s\n\n            work life expectancy and estimated this period to be twenty-seven more years, in\n\n\n\n\n                                                      59\n\f             reliance on statistical work life tables that measure the average working life of a\n\n             woman with the plaintiff’s age and education background. Def.’s Ex. 36, at 29:2–:3.\n\n             Second, Dr. Hurdle differed from the plaintiff’s expert in the after-tax discount rate,\n\n             for which Dr. Hurdle used 8.98 percent. Id. at 21:15–16. That rate, according to Dr.\n\n             Hurdle, took into account the “riskiness of the future earnings that the plaintiff would\n\n             have but-for this injury.” Id. at 18:16–:19. She based this discount rate on the rate\n\n             for which one could obtain a two-year, unsecured loan or the rate a credit card\n\n             company would charge. See id. at 20:5–:24. Finally, unlike the plaintiff’s economic\n\n             expert, Dr. Hurdle deducted consumption, or the percent of the plaintiff’s income she\n\n             would be expected to spend on herself, from the amount of future wages she\n\n             estimated. Id. at 15:9–:14. Based on these calculations, Dr. Hurdle determined the\n\n             plaintiff’s lost wages amount to between $116,176 and $139,740. Id. at 23:5–:9.\n\n2. Both experts agreed that the plaintiff’s economic damages would include the loss of\n\n     household services, which refers to the services the plaintiff would have been able to provide\n\n     to her children had the injury not occurred. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 20:5–:13; Def.’s Ex. 36\n\n     at 25:20–:25, 26:1–:2. The plaintiff’s expert calculated this loss by determining the cost of a\n\n     live-in nanny for the plaintiff’s two children until the youngest child turned eighteen or\n\n     twenty-one and subtracted the value of the services the plaintiff will be able to provide for\n\n     approximately the next two years. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 20:25, 21:1–:4; 21:22–:25. Using\n\n     this methodology, Dr. Lurito opined the plaintiff would suffer economic losses of between\n\n     $508,122 and $652,939. 10 Dr. Lurito applied a 3.5 percent discount rate to his calculations.\n\n\n10\n   The lower end of the range is the number calculated until the plaintiff’s youngest child reaches age eighteen while\nthe higher end of the range is calculated until the plaintiff’s youngest child reaches age twenty-one. Tr. ECF No. 71\nat 21:7–:18.\n\n\n\n                                                              60\n\f     Id. at 23:4–:7. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, calculated loss of household services in\n\n     two ways: the wages for a live-in nanny and the statistical value of the plaintiff’s time\n\n     according to economic statistics tables. Def.’s Ex. 36 at 23:18–:25; 24:17–:24. The\n\n     defendant calculated the value of the plaintiff’s household services based on the plaintiff’s\n\n     youngest child needing services until age eighteen or twenty-one. Id. at 23:23–:24. Dr.\n\n     Hurdle applied an 8.98 percent discount rate to these calculations, assuming the need to\n\n     compensate for the risk that the plaintiff may not have been able to perform these services\n\n     even without the injury and whether the plaintiff’s “children would need that care.” Id. at\n\n     24:8–:12. Using the live-in nanny method of calculation, Dr. Hurdle opined the plaintiff\n\n     stood to lose $367,062. Id. at 27:15. Using the statistical table method, Dr. Hurdle opined\n\n     the plaintiff would suffer between $166,521 and $191,239 in losses. Id. at 27:6–:7.\n\n3. To determine the cost of the plaintiff’s future medical care, both economists relied upon the\n\n     report submitted by Nurse Patterson, the plaintiff’s expert. 11 Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 24:5–\n\n     :9; Def.’s Ex. 36 at 30:11–:17. Nurse Patterson stated the plaintiff would require\n\n     approximately 1.5 years of future care, see Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:13–:17, and in her\n\n     report, Nurse Patterson identified four areas of future care costs: psychological counseling,\n\n     hospice care, medical care, and nursing services. Pl.’s Ex. 53. Dr. Lurito, the plaintiff’s\n\n     expert, estimated the future medical care costs the plaintiff is likely to incur are between\n\n     $146,682 and $149,886 based on the potential escalation of costs over the next 1.5 years and\n\n     applying a 3.5 percent discount rate. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 25:21–:25; 26:1; 26:6–11. The\n\n     defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, adjusted Nurse Patterson’s estimates to provide a range of\n\n     estimated costs for obtaining counseling and in-home nursing services, with a low range\n\n\n11\n Nurse Patterson’s calculations include the recommendations of the plaintiff’s social worker, Mila Tecala. Tr. ECF\nNo. 56 at 94:20–:22.\n\n\n                                                            61\n\f   determined by using District of Columbia wage rates, and, for the upper range, using the\n\n   actual costs to a client for such counseling. Def.’s Ex. 36 at 31:3–:11; 35:2–:23. For in-\n\n   patient hospice care, Dr. Hurdle opined the plaintiff could move into a nursing home and use\n\n   out-patient hospice care (being brought into the nursing home) instead of moving into a\n\n   hospice. Id. at 36:5–:20. Overall, Dr. Hurdle estimated the lower bound for future care\n\n   costs, including in-patient hospice care, to be $90,434 and the upper bound to be $111,889.\n\n   Id. at 37:12–:13.\n\n       N.     The Plaintiff’s Non-Economic Damages\n\n1. The plaintiff is seeking non-economic damages in the amount of $6 million in addition to\n\n   economic damages. Compl. at 8, ECF No. 1. To describe the plaintiff’s non-economic\n\n   damages for pain and suffering, the plaintiff provided, in addition to her own testimony, the\n\n   testimony of her treating oncologist and the licensed social worker who evaluated her mental\n\n   health.\n\n2. The plaintiff’s oncologist, Dr. Yoo, testified the plaintiff was “very saddened” when he\n\n   informed her that her cancer was incurable. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 23:16. With respect to\n\n   her physical condition, he testified the plaintiff was complaining continuously of bone pain\n\n   as of February 14, 2012. Trial Id. at 24:7–:8. As Dr. Yoo continued to treat the plaintiff, he\n\n   testified, she complained of worsening bone pain, particularly in the “low back, hip and\n\n   multiple joints.” Id. at 28:4–:10. At times, the plaintiff was taking narcotic pain relievers to\n\n   alleviate her bone pain. Id. at 33:17–:18. Dr. Yoo testified that he didn’t “recollect there was\n\n   a significant pain free, truly pain-free period” between the time he began treating her in\n\n   January 2012 and the time of trial. Id. at 33:25–34:5. The treatments rendered the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                                    62\n\f   temporarily post-menopausal, id. at 30:6–:10, and caused her to be bloated and gain weight.\n\n   Id. at 31:22–:23.\n\n3. Ms. Tecala, who evaluated the plaintiff’s mental health in 2012 and again in 2013, Trial Tr.\n\n   ECF No. 70 at 94:13–16, testified that the plaintiff was diagnosed with depression in 2012.\n\n   Id. at 95:23. Ms. Tecala testified the plaintiff told her “she only could sleep maybe four or\n\n   five hours a night” and “stays in bed or stays on the couch and watches TV because she [is]\n\n   too tired or too much in pain to do anything” other than take her children to school and pick\n\n   them up from school. Id. at 97:2–:9. Ms. Tecala noted the plaintiff “had the saddest\n\n   demeanor” and “spoke almost in a whisper, as if talking took so much effort.” Id. at 97:13–\n\n   :16. In testifying about the difference in evaluations between 2012 and 2013, Ms. Tecala\n\n   opined that the plaintiff was more depressed in 2013, id. at 99:18–:21, and Ms. Tecala\n\n   testified the plaintiff is suffering from the loss of health, body parts, and “body experiences\n\n   like pain and suffering.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 9:18–:23. She also testified the plaintiff is\n\n   experiencing anticipatory grieving for her impending death. Id. at 10:5–:15. The plaintiff,\n\n   Ms. Tecala testified, is “very concerned about her children . . . and what would happen to\n\n   them when she dies.” Id. at 12:12–:15. The plaintiff does not “have the energy or the\n\n   wherewithal to [play with her children] because she is in pain.” Id. at 14:7–:8.\n\n4. The plaintiff testified that she had to quit her job because of “the pains that I had been having\n\n   in my body, which was, I couldn’t stand for a long period of time.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at\n\n   103:14–:16. She testified she is unable to pursue her goal of exploring the world because of\n\n   her doctor appointments. Id. at 104:24–105:6. In addition, the chemotherapy has reduced\n\n   the plaintiff’s strength and energy levels. Id. at 105:12–:18. She has lost all of her hair. Id.\n\n   at 105:22. The plaintiff testified she no longer wants to be around people and spends most of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    63\n\f       her days in bed. Id. at 106:1–:7. She feels guilty she will not “be here for long for my kids\n\n       to give them the things that they need.” Id. at 107:6–:9.\n\nIII.

Since Dr. Hill-Daniel is a\n\nfamily practice doctor, the parties agree that the applicable standard is the national standard of\n\ncare for a reasonably prudent family practice doctor. The plaintiff alleges that Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nbreached that standard at multiple points during her treatment of the plaintiff. The Court agrees,\n\nand addresses each alleged breach below.\n\n               1.      December 2009–April 2010\n\n       Based on the factual circumstances in this case and the testimony of the expert witnesses,\n\nthe Court finds that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s conclusions and the corresponding treatment plan that she\n\nprescribed during the plaintiff’s December 3, 2009 visit were not within the national standard of\n\ncare for a family practice doctor.\n\n       Both of the plaintiff’s experts testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel first breached the national\n\nstandard of care by failing to consider breast cancer as part of her “differential diagnosis,” which\n\nis the list of possible diagnoses for a particular set of symptoms. Dr. Sutherland testified that\n\nbreast cancer “absolutely” had to be included on the differential diagnosis of the plaintiff’s breast\n\ncomplaints at the December 9, 2009 visit. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 39:25–40:8. Dr. Margo\n\nexpressed the same opinion. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70. at 64:6–:8. Notably, Dr. Margo’s opinion\n\nwas premised entirely on the words written on the progress note for the plaintiff’s December 3,\n\n2009, visit: that the plaintiff came in because of “pain and tenderness in her breasts,” that she\n\ncomplained of “tenderness and lumpiness,” that there was no change in this pain or lumpiness\n\nwith her menstrual cycle, and that upon examination, Dr. Hill-Daniel found no masses, no\n\nretractions, and no visible lymph nodes. See id. at 54:12–58:22. Dr. Margo emphasized the\n\nsignificance of the notation that the symptoms did not change with the plaintiff’s menstrual\n\n\n\n\n                                                     68\n\fcycle. According to Dr. Margo, women tend to get cysts in their breasts that go away after their\n\nperiod, so the fact that the plaintiff’s lumpiness did not change with her menstrual cycle made\n\nthat diagnosis less likely. Id. at 55:20–:23. Dr. Sutherland also focused primarily on the\n\nundisputedly non-cyclic nature of the plaintiff’s complaints. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 39:20–24\n\n(“So the differential diagnosis in noncyclical breast pain would include potentially chest wall\n\ntenderness, breast cancer. But the differential diagnosis had to be developed that would consider\n\nall the different possibilities.”).\n\n        Relying primarily on the plaintiff’s young age and on what they perceived as the bilateral\n\nnature of her complaints, i.e., meaning that they pertained to both breasts, defendant’s experts\n\nDr. Bethea and Dr. Koch testified that the national standard of care did not require Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel to consider breast cancer as part of her differential diagnosis. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at\n\n32:8–:12 (Dr. Bethea’s testimony that for a “[t]wenty-four year-old with bilateral benign\n\nfibrocystic findings, it would be inappropriate to list cancer as a very real concern simply\n\nbecause it would not be a very real concern. It would be a very rare occurrence.”); id. at 89:8–\n\n:15 (Dr. Koch’s testimony that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s assessment was “perfectly reasonable” for a\n\n“twenty-four-year-old woman complaining of bilateral breast pain and lumpiness in her\n\nbreasts.”).\n\n        The Court finds, in addition, that the plaintiff’s experts succeeded in showing that young\n\nage is not a credible reason for declining to list breast cancer on a differential diagnosis for a\n\nwoman presenting with the plaintiff’s complaints of feeling a “knot” in her breast and\n\nnoncyclical pain, in the context of a medical history of both grandmothers’ having breast cancer.\n\nDr. Sutherland testified that “many breast cancers that are diagnosed in this country today come\n\nfrom the findings of the patient’s own self breast examination, and that’s particularly true in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      69\n\fyounger individuals when routine screening isn’t necessarily done.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at\n\n38:7–:12. Dr. Margo added that “young women often aren’t that sensitized to their body, so a\n\nyoung woman coming in complaining of breast lumps, which is not a common complaint of\n\nyoung women, I would pay more attention to it.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 78:25–79:4.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Margo testified that even though the incidence of breast cancer is rare in women\n\nof the plaintiff’s age, “young women tend to have very aggressive breast cancers,” so it is\n\nparticularly important to diagnose a young woman’s breast cancer early. Id. at 78:19–:22. In her\n\nexpert opinion, breast cancer had to be on the differential diagnosis because “it was the most\n\ndangerous thing to miss.” Id. at 64:6–:8; see also id. 65:16–:18 (Dr, Margo’s testimony that “if\n\nit’s something that would be really terrible if you missed it, then you need to make sure you’re\n\nright” that the cause of the concerns is not that thing).\n\n       The defendants’ experts’ reliance on the bilateral nature of the plaintiff’s complaints also\n\ndiminishes the credibility of their opinions. See Haidak v. Corso, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327 (D.C.\n\n2004) (“Expert testimony may be excluded when the expert is unable to show a reliable basis for\n\n[his] theory.”). The plaintiff testified that she told Dr. Hill-Daniel during the December 3, 2009\n\nvisit that she had a pain and a knot in her left breast. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 78:13–:14 (“I told\n\nher that I had soreness and tenderness in both of my breasts, and a pain and a knot in my left\n\nbreast.”). Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that the plaintiff did not specify that the knot was in one\n\nparticular breast, Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 4:7–:12 (“As noted in the chart, [the plaintiff] came in\n\nwith a new complaint of breast tenderness and lumpiness. She stated that her breasts were tender\n\nall the time. When I asked her in more detail about that, she actually held under her breasts and\n\nbasically just motioned that both breasts were tender and felt lumpy.”); id. at 18:18–:23 (Upon\n\nquestioning by the Court about whether Dr. Hill-Daniel asked the plaintiff about her use of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      70\n\fterm “knot,” Dr. Hill-Daniel responded, “So, during the course of our exam, I asked her, you\n\nknow, is there a particular place, you know, where do you feel the knot? And she couldn’t give\n\nme any specific place. And when I asked her, she just, again, said, they’re all over. So basically\n\nsaying that both breasts felt sore and knots in them [sic], not one specific knot.”). Yet, the\n\nplaintiff’s recollection that she complained of finding a knot in her left breast is wholly\n\nconsistent with the description of symptoms that she undisputedly gave to medical providers at\n\nHoward University Hospital and Fort Washington Hospital in the following months, see Pl.’s Ex.\n\n104, at 23061 (Howard University Hospital medical record from May 19, 2010 describing chief\n\ncomplaint as “knots on left breast”); Pl.’s Ex. 6, at 6003 (Fort Washington medical record from\n\nAugust 9, 2010 describing patient’s complaint as “knot on LT breast”). The parties also agree\n\nthat the notation on the Unity progress note for the December 3, 2009, visit is ambiguous as to\n\nwhether the complaint of lumpiness pertained to one breast or both breasts. Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1013;\n\nDef.’s Ex. 1, at 8 (“Pt also concerned that breast [singular] are [plural] lumpy.”). When\n\nquestioned about the significance of this notation, Dr. Hill-Daniel became particularly defensive.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 59:18–:25 (“Q: And how did you spell breast? Just spell it out for us the\n\nway you wrote it in your note. A: B.R.E.S.T. [sic] Q: Okay. And that would indicate singular?\n\nA: The verb used after that is plural, [are]. So that breast is a typo. Q: Or the word [are] is a\n\ntypo? A: It’s more common to leave off an S than to change a verb.”). In light of all of these\n\nfactors, the Court is inclined to believe the plaintiff’s testimony that she specifically complained\n\nto the healthcare providers at Unity about a knot in her left breast, in addition to complaining that\n\nshe felt tenderness and lumpiness in her breasts generally.\n\n       Dr. Sutherland also testified that the plaintiff’s family history of breast cancer increased\n\nthe importance of including breast cancer on the differential diagnosis because the fact that her\n\n\n\n\n                                                     71\n\ftwo grandmothers were both diagnosed with breast cancer increased her risk. Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n69 at 40:4–:8 (“And one of the other reasons, you know, for that is she was at higher risk also\n\nbecause of the family history. She had two grandmothers that had family – or have a history of\n\nbreast cancer, which increases her risk.”). He testified that an article about screening guidelines\n\nfor breast cancer, as part of the Guam breast and cervical cancer early detection program,\n\nsupports that opinion, Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 4:6–:9, and, indeed, the article states that one or\n\nmore first-or second-degree relatives with breast cancer at an early age (less than 40-50 years of\n\nage) can be a red flag suggestive of genetic susceptibility to breast cancer. Pl.’s Ex. 67, at 4.\n\n        Whether the plaintiff informed Dr. Hill-Daniel about her family history of breast cancer\n\nis another disputed matter. The plaintiff testified that she told both Dr. Hill-Daniel and the\n\nmedical assistant at Unity that her two grandmothers had been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 79:16 (responding to counsel’s question “would you describe for us . . .\n\nthe nature of the discussion [that she had with Dr. Hill-Daniel about cancer],” the plaintiff said,\n\n“I told her I had two grandmothers that had breast cancer,”); id. at 128:17–:18, 129:5–:6\n\n(testifying that she “told them at Unity” that she had a family history of breast cancer and that\n\nshe “told them numerous times when I was, when I seen the nurse before I seen Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel”). Dr. Hill-Daniel’s denial that the plaintiff mentioned her grandmothers’ breast cancer is\n\nnot inconsistent with the plaintiff’s testimony that she disclosed this critical family medical\n\nhistory to the medical assistant. Doctors and medical assistants at Unity generally communicate\n\nonly through written notes in the medical record, and any information obtained by the medical\n\nassistant at the short initial interview with a patient about the reason for the visit that is not\n\ndocumented by the assistant may never reach the treating physician. At the same time, a patient\n\nwho has unburdened herself in an initial interview with a medical professional by describing\n\n\n\n\n                                                       72\n\fpertinent symptoms, history or concerns may rightly believe that the key information will be\n\nhandled appropriately and passed along as needed without the need for repetition.\n\n         In this case, the medical assistant’s notes concerning the December 9, 2009 visit do not\n\nrelay any of the deep concern that the plaintiff described herself as having, in large part due to\n\nher grandmothers’ history of breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 80:4–:12. Rather, this note\n\nconsists of abbreviated descriptions of the plaintiff’s concerns documented in three bullet points.\n\nPl.’s Ex. 1, at 1013; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. Important medical history information that the plaintiff\n\ntold the medical assistant may not have reached Dr. Hill-Daniel because of a lapse in the written\n\ncommunication of the medical assistant. The Court credits the plaintiff’s recollection that she\n\nmentioned her grandmothers’ breast cancer to Unity medical personnel based on her testimony\n\nthat her knowledge of what happened with her grandmothers is what prompted her concern about\n\nher own breast pain and lumpiness in the first place, and her request for a mammogram. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 55 at 80:4–:12. According to Dr. Sutherland, Dr. Hill-Daniel had the responsibility\n\nto pursue whether the plaintiff had any relatives with breast cancer beyond her mother and\n\nsisters. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 71:7–:10. The progress note contains no evidence that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel even asked the plaintiff whether she had grandparents with breast cancer. The progress\n\nnote states only that there is no history of breast cancer in “first-degree relatives,” which is\n\ndefined as a mother, sister, father, or brother, and it is silent as to all other degrees of relatives.\n\nPl.’s Ex. 1, at 1013; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. In sum, Dr. Hill-Daniel’s view that the plaintiff had no\n\nfamily history of breast cancer was incorrect because the plaintiff reported her family history at\n\nleast to the medical assistant, the medical assistant clearly did not write it down, and Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel never inquired further. 13\n\n\n13\n  It is also worth noting that during the bench trial, Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she would not have changed her\nassessment or her actions in December 2009 even if she had known about the plaintiff’s grandmothers’ history of\n\n\n                                                              73\n\f         On the basis of the credible expert testimony, the Court therefore finds that the national\n\nstandard of care required Dr. Hill-Daniel to consider breast cancer as part of her differential\n\ndiagnosis for the plaintiff on December 3, 2009.\n\n         Yet Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that breast cancer was not on her differential diagnosis.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 15:1–25, 55:11–:14 (“A: And you knew [that breast cancer in women\n\nunder thirty is most likely diagnosed by detection of a palpable mass] on December 3, 2009, yet\n\nwith this knowledge, you did not have breast cancer on your differential diagnosis, correct? A:\n\nNothing in the -- correct.”). In fact, it is clear that Dr. Hill-Daniel determined at the December\n\n2009 visit that the plaintiff’s condition was decidedly not breast cancer. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified\n\nthat she reassured the plaintiff that her concerns were benign – meaning not cancer. Id. at 13:21–\n\n:22 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony that she reassured the plaintiff that her concerns were “benign”);\n\nid. at 63:9–:11 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony agreeing that “the term benign refers to a condition,\n\ntumor or growth that is not cancerous”). Dr. Hill-Daniel’s reassurance of the plaintiff and clear\n\nminimization of the plaintiff’s own view about the need for a mammogram or some form of\n\ndiagnostic testing clearly colored the urgency with which the future treatment of the plaintiff by\n\nthis physician and Unity subsequently unfolded. When the Court asked Dr. Hill-Daniel why she\n\ndid not tell the plaintiff to follow up within a specified time period, Dr. Hill-Daniel responded:\n\n“At the time, I felt this was a self-limiting process, meaning that I thought her breast pain, her\n\ntenderness, would spontaneously resolve on her own.” Id. at 17:14–:19. 14\n\n\nbreast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 7:21–8:6 (“Q: And if she had told you that she had a family history of breast\ncancer, with respect to her two grandmothers, how would have changed your assessment, or would it have? A:\nWell, for that particular visit, it may not have changed my plan of care. But I would have counseled [the plaintiff]\ndifferently about the need for future screening . . . .”).\n14\n   The defendant asserts that at the December 2009 appointment, Dr. Hill-Daniel diagnosed the plaintiff with\n“fibrocystic changes,” also known as “fibrotic disease,” see 3rd FOF Table ¶¶ 48(B) (“Her assessment was coded as\n‘breast disorders not otherwise specified.’ It gives reference to the patient’s pain and that it is mostly fibrocystic\nchanges.”), 62(B) (“Dr. Hill-Daniel believed from her initial assessment that the plaintiff had fibrocystic disease of\nboth breasts.”). This characterization is simply not supported by the medical record, the diagnostic code that Dr.\n\n\n                                                              74\n\f         The plaintiff’s experts next testified that because Dr. Hill-Daniel was required to have\n\nbreast cancer on the differential diagnosis for the plaintiff, she was also required to take steps to\n\nrule it out. Dr. Sutherland was the only expert who opined that based on the plaintiff’s\n\npresentation as a twenty-four year old non-lactating woman with noncyclic pain and no\n\nsuspicious findings on examination, the national standard of care required Dr. Hill-Daniel to\n\nrefer her for a diagnostic ultrasound. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 42:1–:7. He based his opinion on\n\nan algorithm published by the California Department of Health as a guideline for primary care\n\nphysicians in 2005, and incorporated into the Guam Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection\n\nProgram Screening Guidelines for Breast Cancer. Pl.’s Exs. 67, 106; Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at\n\n43:23–44:3. Although the defendant attacks this study as inapplicable to a twenty-four year old\n\nwoman, there is no indication that the algorithm is dependent on age. Moreover, the defendant’s\n\nexperts did not present any competing study or protocol based in the scientific literature that\n\nwould suggest that whether to order diagnostic imaging depends on the patient’s age. 15\n\n         Dr. Sutherland ultimately testified that at the very least, the national standard of care\n\nrequired Dr. Hill-Daniel to schedule the plaintiff for a return visit in the next thirty to sixty days\n\nto see whether or not her complaints of noncyclic pain and knots remained and to repeat the\n\nbreast examination. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 37:19–:24. Dr. Margo also testified that the next\n\nstep required by the national standard of care was to schedule an appointment for the plaintiff to\n\nfollow-up about her breast complaints in the next four to six weeks. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at\n\n61:15–:23. Even the defendant’s expert, Dr. Koch, opined that Dr. Hill-Daniel had “an\n\n\nHill-Daniel used, or the testimony in this case. In fact, Dr. Carter testified that fibrotic disease “comes and goes\nwith menses,” Trial Tr. ECF No. 72 at 133:15–:16, and Dr. Hill-Daniel clearly documented in the medical record\n“no change with menstrual cycle,” Pl.’s Ex. 1 at 1013; Def.’s Ex. 1 at 8.\n15\n  Although defendant’s counsel alluded to a competing protocol during her cross-examination of Dr. Sutherland,\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 83:23 –87:6, the article to which she referred was not admitted as evidence in this case and\nnone of defendant’s expert witnesses testified that their opinions were informed by it.\n\n\n                                                               75\n\fobligation to say, if your symptoms do not go away . . . with the interventions that I suggested,\n\nplease come back to be reevaluated.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 127:17–:21. Dr. Hill-Daniel took\n\nno such steps to further assess whether the plaintiff had breast cancer. Rather, she reassured the\n\nplaintiff of the benign nature of her concern, told her that no imaging was warranted,\n\nrecommended that she change her bra, and prescribed her a strong dose of Ibuprofen.\n\n        While there is no dispute that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not schedule, or insist on the scheduling\n\nof, a follow-up appointment for the plaintiff in the next two months, there is some dispute over\n\nwhat Dr. Hill-Daniel did tell the plaintiff regarding follow-up, if anything. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\ntestified that she recalled telling the plaintiff “to follow up if she didn’t have any relief of the\n\npain, or if her symptoms persisted,” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 16:12–:18. The plaintiff, on the\n\nother hand, testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel never mentioned any follow-up to her at all. Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 70 at 20:22–21:7. Under the heading of “follow-up,” the progress note contains only\n\nthe nonspecific notation, “PRN,” – meaning “as needed.” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1066; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8;\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 16:8–:9 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony that PRN stands for “as needed”).\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds the plaintiff’s testimony to be credible and finds that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel did not adequately explain to the plaintiff when, or even if, she should follow up.\n\n        Whatever Dr. Hill-Daniel told the plaintiff about follow-up, there is no question that she\n\nunwarrantedly told the plaintiff that her symptoms were not cause for concern. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\ntestified that she told the plaintiff that her symptoms were benign, i.e. non-cancerous, Pl.’s Ex. 1,\n\nat 1013 & Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8 (progress note for December 3, 2009 visit, stating under “treatment”\n\nthat “Pt reassured about benign nature iof [sic] her concern”); see also Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n63:9–:11 (Dr. Hill-Daniel’s testimony agreeing that “the term benign refers to a condition, tumor\n\nor growth that is not cancerous”), which, according to Dr. Margo, Dr. Hill-Daniel did not have\n\n\n\n\n                                                       76\n\fenough information to do. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 60:10–:14. The problem with making such\n\nan unsubstantiated assurance, according to Dr. Margo, is the patient will stop paying attention to\n\nthe symptoms or will not bring them up to the physician again in the future because she thinks\n\nthat the problem is benign. Id. at 61:3–:11. Dr. Margo explained that Dr. Hill-Daniel “didn’t\n\nleave the door open for something other than a benign problem.” Id. at 60:16–:19. Even if Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel had told the plaintiff during her December 2009 visit that she should follow-up if her\n\nsymptoms persisted, she also conveyed the clear indication that the plaintiff should have no\n\nconcern about any danger from the persistence of her symptoms. The defendant’s expert, Dr.\n\nKoch, conceded to the Court that the only reason a patient would follow-up about persistent\n\nsymptoms after being assured of their benign nature would be for further pain management.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 91:20–92:5 (suggesting other medical modalities for pain management\n\nthat the doctor could have prescribed if the patient were to return complaining that her symptoms\n\nwere persisting). 16\n\n         The defendant’s experts, Dr. Bethea and Dr. Koch, testified that in their opinions the\n\nnational standard of care did not require Dr. Hill-Daniel to schedule a follow-up appointment or\n\norder diagnostic imaging. As with their opinions about the differential diagnosis, both of them\n\nrelied primarily on the plaintiff’s age and the fact that her complaints of pain and lumpiness were\n\n“bilateral” or occurring in both breasts. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 32:8–:12 (“Twenty-four year-\n\nold with bilateral benign fibrocystic findings, it would be inappropriate to list cancer as a very\n\nreal concern simply because it would not be a very real concern. It would be a very rare\n\n16\n  Despite Dr. Hill-Daniel’s failure to schedule a follow-up visit for the plaintiff, Dr. Hill-Daniel had additional\nopportunities to follow-up with the plaintiff when she saw the plaintiff for unrelated complaints on January 8, 2011,\nand April 30, 2011. While the Court declines to hold as a general matter that doctors must review all of a patient’s\npast symptoms and discuss them with the patient to ensure that they are not persisting, in this case, the progress\nnotes for the January and April, 2011 visits reflect that the plaintiff was still being prescribed pain-killing\nmedication for her breast pain and this, at a minimum, could have prompted an inquiry into whether that medication\nwas still needed. Dr. Hill-Daniel missed these two opportunities to inquire into the persistence of the plaintiff’s\nbreast symptoms. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 21:5–:9; 77:21–:23.\n\n\n                                                             77\n\foccurrence.”); id. at 86:19–87:7 (explaining that the national standard of care does not require a\n\nreferral for imaging when “if you listen to the patient, you listen to what she has to say, she’s\n\ntalking about a bilateral issue. She is talking about the breasts being uncomfortable, and she\n\nfeels that they are lumpy, and you do a physical examination on the patient, and you don’t find\n\nanything there”); id. at 89:8–:15 (“[S]he took in the chief complaint; she did a physical exam;\n\nshe made an assessment, and she gave the patient suggestions for management, and then she\n\ninvited the patient to come back should the symptoms continue. It was a perfectly reasonable\n\nthing to do in a twenty-four-year-old woman complaining of bilateral breast pain and lumpiness\n\nin her breasts.”). The Court discounts the value of these opinions for the same reasons the\n\ndefendant’s experts’ opinions regarding the differential diagnosis are discounted: not only is the\n\nage of the patient not dispositive as to whether a breast “knot” is benign, the plaintiff’s testimony\n\nthat she complained specifically about a knot in her left breast is credible. Moreover, the defense\n\nexperts did not address the fact that the plaintiff’s breast complaints were noncyclical. Thus, the\n\ngrounds on which the defense experts based their opinion about the defendant’s compliance with\n\nthe national standard of care at the December 2009 visit in terms of diagnosis, follow-up care,\n\nand treatment are not predicated on the material factual findings in this case. This faulty premise\n\nalso invalidates Dr. Bethea’s testimony that if a physician were to schedule a follow-up with\n\nevery patient presenting with the plaintiff’s symptoms, it would “flood the system unnecessarily\n\nwith essentially zero return on your effort.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 27:1–:4.\n\n       Accordingly, the Court finds that Dr. Hill-Daniel breached the national standard of care\n\non December 3, 2009 by, at the very least, not scheduling a follow-up visit for the plaintiff in\n\nthirty to sixty days to reassess the plaintiff’s complaints of bilateral breast pain and a knot in her\n\nleft breast, and to repeat a breast examination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      78\n\f                  2.       August–October 2010\n\n         The plaintiff next argues that Dr. Hill Daniel and Unity breached the national standard of\n\ncare by delaying for more than two months the plaintiff’s appointment for a mammogram\n\nreferral after the plaintiff first attempted to make the appointment. The plaintiff testified that,\n\nafter her visit to the emergency room at Fort Washington Hospital where she was advised that\n\nobtaining a mammogram was “very important,” 17 she called Unity the very next day and asked\n\nthe receptionist to schedule the first available appointment to see Dr. Hill Daniel because she\n\nneeded a mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 92:1–:13. She was first given an appointment\n\ndate of September 9, 2010, but Unity cancelled that appointment and another rescheduled\n\nappointment for September 24, 2011 before the plaintiff finally saw Dr. Hill-Daniel on October\n\n18, 2010. Pl.’s Ex. 33.\n\n         The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Sutherland, testified that when Unity cancelled the plaintiff’s\n\nSeptember 9, 2010, appointment, the standard of care required Unity to reschedule it “as quickly\n\nas possible, and I think certainly within a week at the maximum.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at\n\n51:16–:18. He opined that if it were not possible for Dr. Hill-Daniel to see her during that time,\n\nshe should have been scheduled to see one of Dr. Hill-Daniel’s colleagues. Id. at 51:18–22. As\n\nto the second time the appointment was rescheduled, Dr. Sutherland opined that rescheduling the\n\nappointment as quickly as possible was particularly imperative because the plaintiff had already\n\nbeen waiting to be seen for several extra weeks. Id. at 52:5–:9.\n\n\n\n\n17\n  The defendant appears to dispute that the health-care providers at Fort Washington Hospital told the plaintiff that\nshe needed a mammogram. See 3rd FOF Table ¶ 90(B) (“There is no indication from the Fort Washington medical\nrecord that the Plaintiff was told to get a mammogram.”). However, the progress note from the plaintiff’s October\n18, 2011 visit with Dr. Hill-Daniel, which states “P tseen [sic] in ER regarding mass but was told to f/u with PMD\nfor mammogram,” is consistent with the plaintiff’s testimony that she was told at Fort Washington Hospital that she\nneeded a mammogram, Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 90:12–:14.\n\n\n                                                              79\n\f       Dr. Sutherland based his opinion on “the fact that the reason for that request [for a\n\nmammogram] was the fact that a mass had been found at Fort Washington and she was told to\n\nproceed to get – see her primary care physician for further testing.” Id. at 51:2–:7. There is no\n\nevidence in the record, however, that the plaintiff actually told the receptionist at the time that\n\nshe called to make her appointment, or during the period of time over which her appointments\n\nwere rescheduled, about her experience at Fort Washington, the mass they palpated in her left\n\nbreast, or their recommendation that it was “very important” that she follow up with her primary\n\ncare physician. As described above, the plaintiff testified only that she asked for the first\n\navailable appointment because she needed a mammogram. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 92:1–:13.\n\n       The Court is troubled that the receptionist did not inquire into the basis for the urgency\n\nthat the plaintiff expressed in seeing Dr. Hill-Daniel, particularly in the face of her explicit\n\nrequest for a mammogram referral, and with the length of time that that it took for Unity to fit the\n\nplaintiff in to be seen by a physician. While clerical personnel certainly are not expected to have\n\nthe same level of expertise as other medical professionals, personnel responsible for cancelling\n\nand re-scheduling appointments at a medical clinic should have sufficient training to inquire into\n\na patient’s perspective or understanding regarding the timing needs for an doctor’s visit, or to\n\nconfer with a physician when the schedule does not permit an appointment within the time-frame\n\nthe patient believed is required. Instead, the Unity scheduling personnel, with whom the plaintiff\n\nspoke, approached the making of an appointment as a purely ministerial task without any\n\nmedical implications, and this is simply not the case when the context is a medical clinic\n\nproviding primary care.\n\n       Moreover, the defendant’s assertion that the plaintiff should have made an appointment\n\nwith another doctor or visited the clinic as a “walk-in” is simply not persuasive. Def.’s Concls.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      80\n\fat 11–12. The doctor at the Fort Washington Hospital Emergency Room specifically told the\n\nplaintiff to “go back to your doctor.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 90:22–:24. At the time, Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel was the plaintiff’s primary care physician and she was the doctor that the plaintiff had\n\ninitially gone to with her breast complaints. The defendant also presented no evidence that the\n\nplaintiff was advised by anyone at Unity at the time of the cancellation of her two appointments\n\nwith her primary care physician, or at any other time, that she had the option of scheduling an\n\nappointment with another doctor, or that she could continue to come in for walk-in visits after\n\nshe had been assigned a primary care physician. Although the plaintiff had visited Unity as a\n\nwalk-in patient in the past, all of the records of her walk-in visits are from before Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nbecame assigned as the plaintiff’s primary care physician. Def.’s Ex. 1, at 14–16; see also Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 72 at 82:5–:10.\n\n       Yet, because the plaintiff has not provided any expert opinion regarding the national\n\nstandard of care applicable to medical clinics for the re-scheduling of cancelled doctor visits in\n\nlight of the facts as presented in this case, the Court cannot find that the plaintiff has proven by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the delay attendant to the cancellation and re-scheduling of\n\ntwo appointments that the plaintiff had with Dr. Hill-Daniel in September and October, 2011\n\nconstituted a breach of the national standard of care.\n\n               3.      October 18, 2010–March 8, 2011\n\n       Finally, the plaintiff asserts that Dr. Hill-Daniel was negligent in permitting almost five\n\nmonths to pass between the October 18, 2010 appointment and her March 8, 2011 breast cancer\n\ndiagnosis.\n\n       There is no dispute that Dr. Hill-Daniel examined the plaintiff on October 18, 2010, and\n\npalpated “multiple small mobile nodules” in her left breast and lymph nodes in her left axilla.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      81\n\fPl.’s Ex. 1, at 1060; Def.’s Ex. 1, at 8. While all of the experts agreed that Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nordered the correct tests in a permissible progression, both of the plaintiff’s family medicine\n\nexperts testified that under these circumstances, the national standard of care required a quick\n\nevaluation through this progression of imaging and biopsy to determine whether the\n\nabnormalities were breast cancer. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 81:15–:17 (Dr. Margo’s testimony\n\nthat the national standard of care required “very quick evaluation with imaging and referral to a\n\nspecialist to take care of it if it turns out, in fact, to be breast cancer”); Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at\n\n53:16–:18 (“In light of those findings with the history, it was Dr. Hill-Daniel’s responsibility to\n\nexpedite diagnostic testing as soon as possible.”). Both of the plaintiff’s experts also testified\n\nthat the national standard of care required that the plaintiff’s breast cancer be diagnosed in no\n\nmore than two to three weeks in total. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 82:10–:25 (Dr. Margo); Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 69 at 54:19–55:5 (Dr. Sutherland). Within this overarching timeframe, Dr. Sutherland\n\ntestified that the national standard of care required that the diagnostic ultrasound be done within\n\na week of the October visit, Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 54:2–:12, and Dr. Margo testified that the\n\nrequired time was two weeks, Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 82:10–82:25.\n\n        The defendant’s expert, Dr. Koch, testified that the national standard of care was satisfied\n\nby the physician prescribing a six-week follow-up period during which the patient should get the\n\nultrasound. When pressed on the appropriate timeframe for obtaining diagnostic tests, however,\n\nDr. Koch expressed significant doubt about his qualifications to make any judgment about how\n\nlong diagnostic measures for breast cancer should take. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 11:16–:22 (“I\n\nthink an oncologist could speak to that much better than I . . . . I would probably let an\n\noncologist, you know, speak [to] that.”). The Court therefore does not credit his judgment about\n\nwhat the standard of care requires with respect to the diagnostic process for breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       82\n\f       The defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s actions did not violate\n\nthe national standard of care, but said, in response to questioning by the Court, that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel’s detection of lymph node involvement was a “game-changer,” and that once that\n\nhappened, it was not appropriate to wait six weeks before an ultrasound was performed. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 73 at 40:24–41:2. He then attempted to backpedal by redefining the national\n\nstandard of care as dependent on the practical circumstances under which the care is delivered –\n\nin particular, the financial circumstances of the medical institution and the type of insurance that\n\nthe patient has. See id. at 44:4–47:11. Finally, he confused the matter by opining that “[t]he\n\ntime frame does not dictate the compliance with the standard of care. It dictates compliance with\n\nbest practice.” Id. at 49:6–:9. The law in this jurisdiction, however, establishes that the conduct\n\nof a health care provider, whether a physician or institution, should be measured against the\n\nnational standard of care, which in turn depends on the course that is followed nationally by\n\nphysicians or institutions in the same field as the defendant.

Moreover, the standard must be established through\n\n“reference to a published standard, [discussion] of the described course of treatment with\n\npractitioners outside the District . . . at seminars or conventions, or through presentation of\n\nrelevant data.” Strickland v. Pinder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 770 (D.C. 2006); see also Travers v.

Dr. Bethea’s opinion that it was appropriate for Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel to prescribe a six-week follow up period is not based on a national standard for\n\nfamily care physicians or for institutions that offer primary care services to patients. Rather, it\n\n\n\n\n                                                     83\n\fseems to be based on his opinion that different standards apply depending on the institutional\n\ncontext in which treatment is delivered. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 46:19–:23 (“These\n\ndays, unfortunately, doctors lose control of the situation in big medical centers, such as where\n\nthis occurred. They don’t lose control of it in a practice like mine. So it’s two entirely different\n\ncircumstances.”). That understanding does not comport with the law in this jurisdiction.\n\n       Assessing whether Dr. Hill-Daniel satisfied any of the expert witness’s constructions of\n\nthe national standard of care, the Court must consider that Dr. Hill Daniel did nothing to expedite\n\nany of the tests that she ordered for the plaintiff, and that there is no evidence that she or any of\n\nher staff explained to the plaintiff the appropriate timeframe for obtaining the tests or the reason\n\nwhy it was important to obtain them quickly. As to the ultrasound, Dr. Hill-Daniel wrote a\n\nreferral and sent it to Ms. Jones for processing. Although Dr. Hill-Daniel asked Ms. Jones to\n\nexpedite the insurance authorization process, the plaintiff was not notified that Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nhad asked Ms. Jones to expedite the referral, and Dr. Hill-Daniel did not direct Ms. Jones to\n\ndiscuss the timing of the ultrasound with the plaintiff. Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that she\n\n“basically stressed the importance of her to get the study done and come back to me for the\n\nresults so we could figure out what else we needed to do,” Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 29:1–:3, but\n\nthis nonspecific recollection does not speak to the timeframe she used or the explanation she\n\ngave for why “figure[ing] out what else we needed to do” was important. Moreover, there is no\n\nnotation on the progress note that Dr. Hill-Daniel actually told the plaintiff the importance of\n\nhaving the procedure done quickly, and the plaintiff testified that Dr. Hill-Daniel did not give her\n\nany indication of how quickly the procedure should be done. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 97:4–:6\n\n(“Q: [D]id Dr. Hill-Daniel tell you about how quickly you were supposed to have the ultrasound\n\nperformed? A: She didn’t give me no discussion about the ultrasound.”). Dr. Hill-Daniel also\n\n\n\n\n                                                      84\n\ftestified on cross-examination that she did not remember specifically telling the plaintiff that she\n\nshould get an appointment for the ultrasound within one to two weeks. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at\n\n96:25–97:3. Rather, the notation in the progress note says that the prescribed follow-up is six\n\nweeks, and Dr. Hill-Daniel testified that “I felt six weeks was enough time for her to get the\n\nreferral, make her appointments, get the exam done and report back to me.” Id. at 28:24–29:5.\n\n       Thus, reviewing the evidence as a whole shows that while Dr. Hill-Daniel may have told\n\nthe plaintiff that the ultrasound was important to diagnose her symptoms, she did not tell the\n\nplaintiff that she needed to get it done quickly or explain that the reason it was important was to\n\nrule out the possibility that she had breast cancer. Relaying the urgency of having the test\n\nperformed quickly would have been particularly important in this case, given that Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nhad assured the plaintiff that her concerns were benign and could be treated with a change in her\n\nbra, only ten months earlier.\n\n       Moreover, although it is not clear that Dr. Hill-Daniel told the plaintiff to follow-up at all,\n\nthe best-case scenario is that Dr. Hill-Daniel told the plaintiff that the follow-up time was six-\n\nweeks. This is far longer than the one to two-week timeframe that the plaintiff’s experts testified\n\nthat the national standard of care required. Even the defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified that\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel’s detection of lymph node involvement was a “game changer,” and that once that\n\nhappened, it was not appropriate to wait six weeks before an ultrasound was performed. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 73 at 39:23–41:2. The defendant’s other family medicine expert, Dr. Koch, who\n\nasserted that Dr. Hill-Daniel was within the standard of care by giving the plaintiff a six-week\n\nfollow-up for the October 18, 2011 appointment, also testified that “there’s certainly an\n\nobligation on a physician’s part to impart some need to expedite things.” Id. at 113:2–:3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     85\n\f       More troubling is that on November 3, 2011 – more than two weeks after the October 18,\n\n2011 visit – Dr. Hill-Daniel became aware that the plaintiff had gone to Providence Hospital to\n\nhave the ultrasound done, and that she was unable to have the procedure because of an error that\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel herself had made with the IDC-9 code on the plaintiff’s referral form. When Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel corrected the code, she was aware that the ultrasound technician had already left for\n\nthe day and, thus, that the plaintiff would have to reschedule the ultrasound appointment.\n\nNonetheless, Dr. Hill-Daniel still did nothing to ensure that the plaintiff would be able to have\n\nthe ultrasound done quickly. She did not call the radiologist at Providence Hospital or direct her\n\nstaff to call. She did not even call the plaintiff to make sure she was aware that she should try to\n\nhave the procedure rescheduled quickly. Dr. Sutherland testified that as the physician\n\nresponsible for the management of the patient, Dr. Hill-Daniel was required to take a leadership\n\nrole and/or delegate to her staff to make sure that the ultrasound was done within a week. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 69 at 55:14–57:7. Yet, two weeks after she wrote the referral, Dr. Hill-Daniel knew\n\nthat the plaintiff still had not been able to have the ultrasound and Dr. Hill-Daniel did nothing.\n\n       Dr. Hill-Daniel finally received the ultrasound report on December 27, 2011, with the\n\nalarming finding that “a more aggressive lesion cannot be excluded.” Pl.’s Ex. 13, at 1; Def.’s\n\nEx. 5, at 1. Dr. Hill-Daniel also saw the radiologist’s recommendation that she refer the plaintiff\n\nfor a mammogram. At this point, Dr. Hill-Daniel had to be aware that it had taken the plaintiff\n\ntwo months to have the diagnostic ultrasound. In addition, Dr. Hill-Daniel knew that the\n\nabnormal result from the ultrasound meant that the plaintiff potentially had breast cancer. Trial\n\nTr. ECF No. 58 at 98:3–:9 (“Q: You knew [the plaintiff] potentially might have cancer. And\n\nyou knew now that you had an abnormal result from an ultrasound, right? A: Yes. Q: And you\n\ndidn’t tell her anything about how quickly she should get the mammogram? A: No, I can’t\n\n\n\n\n                                                     86\n\frecall speaking to her.”). Yet, Dr. Hill-Daniel still did nothing to ensure that the plaintiff\n\nreceived a quick diagnosis or at least was aware of the urgency of the situation. Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\ndid not even contact the plaintiff herself, let alone take the time to explain to the plaintiff that the\n\nmammogram needed to be done quickly and why. Trial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 113:2–:3. Rather, Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel generated a referral for a mammogram of the left breast as directed by the\n\nradiologist, sent it to Ms. Jones for authorization, and asked Ms. Jones to call the plaintiff to pick\n\nup the referral form and schedule an appointment. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 41:11–:15. In fact,\n\nwhile Dr. Hill-Daniel marked the referral for the mammogram as urgent and sent it to Ms. Jones\n\nelectronically on December 30, 2011 in order to expedite the insurance authorization process,\n\nshe did not even take care to discover that Ms. Jones was out of the office and would not return –\n\nor therefore process the referral – for an entire week. As a result, the plaintiff’s diagnosis was\n\ndelayed further.\n\n        The plaintiff finally had the mammogram, which she had originally requested in\n\nDecember, 2009 and, again, in September, 2010 and, again, in October, 2010, performed on\n\nFebruary 9, 2011. After receiving a call from the radiologist at Providence Hospital regarding\n\nthe abnormal results of the plaintiff’s mammogram, Dr. Hill-Daniel contacted the plaintiff on\n\nFebruary 10, 2011. Dr. Hill-Daniel told the plaintiff during this telephone call that the plaintiff\n\nneeded to be seen by a surgeon for a biopsy, but she still did not communicate the urgency of the\n\nsituation to her or the reason for the biopsy. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 111:8–112:1. In fact, Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel testified that she would not have used the word cancer with the plaintiff because you\n\n“don’t have that diagnosis until the biopsy is done.” Id. at 111:23–:25. Despite knowing how\n\nlong the diagnostic process had already taken, and despite having admitting privileges at\n\nProvidence Hospital, Dr. Hill-Daniel did not call the surgeon to whom she referred the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                                       87\n\fin order to expedite the biopsy. See id. 116:21–:25 (Dr. Hill-Daniel acknowledged that it was\n\nmore likely that the test would have been scheduled quicker if she had called Providence\n\nHospital than if the plaintiff called). The biopsy was not performed until March 8, 2011 – nearly\n\na month after Dr. Hill-Daniel first learned about the mammogram results, and nearly five months\n\nafter she had palpated the nodules in the plaintiff’s left breast and the lymph nodes in the axilla.\n\n       Defendant cites Forman v. Pillsbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460190\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460190/forman-v-pillsbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (D.D.C. 1990), for the\n\nproposition that a rule requiring a physician to take significant measures to ensure that a properly\n\ninformed patient follows the doctor’s instructions would be unworkable and overly paternalistic.\n\nDef.’s Concls. at 14. That case is distinguishable. In Forman, doctors at Mt. Sinai Hospital had\n\nprescribed a medication for the patient and, aware that the medication could suppress white\n\nblood cell production, they recommended in a clear communication to the patient that he follow\n\na schedule to closely monitor his white blood cell count while on the medication. Id. at 15–17.\n\nThe patient failed to adhere to the schedule, however, and while on the medication, the patient’s\n\nwhite blood cell count dropped, causing him to suffer coronary arrest and die. Id. at 16. His\n\nmother sued his physician for medical malpractice, arguing that the monitoring schedule\n\nrepresented the standard of care and that her son’s physicians were required to abide by it. Id.\n\nThe only allegation of negligence at trial was the doctor’s failure to monitor the patient’s white\n\nblood cell count on one particular occasion. The court first found that the plaintiff had not\n\nproved that the failure to monitor on that one occasion was the proximate cause of the patient’s\n\nharm. Id. at 18. It next found that even if there were sufficient evidence to support a finding of\n\nproximate cause, the plaintiff had not presented sufficient expert testimony to support her theory\n\nof the standard of care. Id. The court stated that the plaintiff’s expert discounted the fact that the\n\nplaintiff “was well aware of the schedule and the importance of monitoring the patient’s white\n\n\n\n\n                                                     88\n\fblood count” and that nonetheless, the plaintiff failed to take the patient to the doctor\n\nconsistently. Id. at 19. The court rejected the expert’s testimony that a doctor has “the duty to\n\nmake sure that a patient comes to the office for treatment,” holding instead that the “defendant’s\n\nobligation consisted of informing plaintiff of the need for monitoring and performing the tests\n\nwith plaintiff’s cooperation.” Id.\n\n         This Court agrees that the patient must take responsibility for following a doctor’s orders,\n\nbut the problem here is that the patient was not given the information that she needed and to\n\nwhich the national standard of care entitled her, in order to obtain the appropriate level of care.\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel failed to express the urgency with which the plaintiff needed to have the\n\ndiagnostic tests performed and failed to explain to her the appropriate time frame to schedule the\n\ntests. Moreover, after discovering that her own error delayed the plaintiff’s ability to obtain the\n\nmedically necessary tests, Dr. Hill-Daniel still did nothing to expedite the timeframe or even to\n\nimpart to the plaintiff that the timeframe should be expedited. With clear knowledge of the\n\nlength of time it took for the plaintiff to have the ultrasound performed, Dr. Hill-Daniel still took\n\nno steps to assist the plaintiff in obtaining the follow-on mammogram and the biopsy in a more\n\nexpedited fashion or even to explain to the plaintiff that it was important that she do so. Unlike\n\nin Forman, there is no evidence here that the plaintiff was “well aware” of the appropriate\n\nschedule for obtaining her diagnostic tests or why it was important that they be done quickly.\n\n         At a minimum, all four experts ultimately agreed that the national standard of care\n\nrequired Dr. Hill-Daniel to impart some need to expedite testing once she palpated the nodules in\n\nthe plaintiff’s left breast and lymph nodes and to not impede the plaintiff’s ability to do so. 18 Dr.\n\n\n18\n  As explained above, plaintiff’s experts’ reliably testified that the appropriate schedule was one to two weeks to\nobtain the diagnostic ultrasound, and two to three weeks to reach the ultimate diagnosis. As a practical matter,\nhowever, the Court finds that the standard is well short of the eight weeks it actually took to obtain the diagnostic\nultrasound and the five months that it took to reach the ultimate diagnosis in this case.\n\n\n                                                               89\n\fHill-Daniel failed to do that. Therefore, the plaintiff has successfully proven that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel’s actions – or inaction – breached the national standard of care.\n\n       C.        THE TREATING PHYSICIAN’S BREACH OF THE NATIONAL\n                 STANDARD OF CARE WAS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE\n                 PLAINTIFF’S PROGRESSION FROM STAGE I TO STAGE IV CANCER.\n\n       The Court also finds that the plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nDr. Hill-Daniel’s breach of the national standard of care caused her breast cancer to progress\n\nfrom a Stage I curable disease to the Stage IV incurable disease that she now faces.\n\n       “It is a bedrock rule of . . . tort . . . law that a defendant is only liable for harms he\n\nproximately caused.” United States v.

See id. at 77–78. 19\n\n         Similarly here, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that if Dr. Hill-Daniel had\n\nsatisfied the national standard of care, it is more likely than not that the course of treatment she\n\n19\n   There is some ambiguity as to whether the “more likely than not” standard applies in the narrow category of cases\ninvolving negligent treatment of a potentially fatal condition. In Grant v. Am. Nat’l Red Cross, the D.C. Court of\nAppeals left open the possibility that a previous case, Ferell v. Rosenbaum, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. 1997), had eased the\nburden of proof in such cases to the “lost chance” doctrine, i.e., that if proper treatment had been given in\naccordance with the standard of care, the patient would have a greater chance of avoiding harm. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322\n(D.C. 2000). The Grant court stated: “In such a case, the lost chance doctrine may well make sense because of the\ndifficulty of differentiating between the consequences of a pre-existing condition and those flowing from the\nnegligent failure to ameliorate it.” Id. at 322. The court, however, refused to establish such a separate standard, id.\nat 321 (“Upon analysis, we do not read Ferrell as deviating from the basic standard of proof of causation by\nprobability.”), and ultimately, the court distinguished the case before it from Ferell on the facts. Id. at 322–23. This\ncourt need not determine whether Ferrell eased the burden of proof for causation in this case, because the plaintiff\nhas proved causation under the well-established stricter standard.\n\n\n                                                               91\n\fwould have received would have led to the treatment and cure of her breast cancer. To\n\ndetermine whether the plaintiff has satisfied that burden, the Court will evaluate the sufficiency\n\nof the plaintiff’s expert testimony to show, based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\n\nfirst, that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s satisfaction of the standard of care would have led to a diagnosis\n\nwhen the cancer was at an earlier stage, and next, that if the plaintiff’s cancer had been\n\ndiagnosed at that earlier stage, is it more likely than not that the course of treatment she would\n\nhave received would have led to the treatment and eradication of her cancer.\n\n               1. A Follow-up Examination In Compliance With the Standard of Care\n                  Within Thirty to Sixty Days after the Plaintiff’s December 3, 2009 visit\n                  Would More Likely Than Not Have Produced A Cancer Diagnosis While\n                  the Condition was Stage I.\n\n       Relying on the opinions of her experts Dr. Tucker and Dr. Pushkas, the plaintiff argues\n\nthat if Dr. Hill-Daniel had satisfied the standard of care on December 3, 2009 by setting up an\n\nappointment for the plaintiff to return after thirty to sixty days in order to reevaluate her breast\n\npain and knots, instead of reassuring her during that visit that her symptoms were benign, the\n\nplaintiff’s breast cancer was more likely to have been diagnosed while it was Stage I. Notably,\n\nthe defendant has not contested that diagnostic imaging would have led to a breast cancer\n\ndiagnosis, even as early as December 2009. Instead, the defendant argues, based on testimony\n\nfrom its expert Dr. Feigert, that the plaintiff’s breast cancer was already at Stage III-B or even\n\nStage IV at the time of her first appointment with Dr. Hill-Daniel expressing concerns about her\n\nbreasts and requesting a mammogram. Thus, according to the defendant, even if Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nbreached the standard of care in her treatment of the plaintiff in December 2009, this was not the\n\nproximate cause of her Stage IV breast cancer. For the reasons explained below, Dr. Feigert’s\n\nopinion is simply not persuasive. The Court concludes that the plaintiff has carried her burden of\n\nshowing that had Dr. Hill-Daniel directed the plaintiff to return for another visit in thirty to sixty\n\n\n\n                                                      92\n\fdays after December 3, 2009, it is more likely than not that her breast cancer would have been\n\ndetected while it was Stage I.\n\n       To explain this conclusion, the Court will first address the expert testimony regarding\n\nwhen the plaintiff’s cancer would have been diagnosed if Dr. Hill-Daniel had satisfied the\n\nstandard of care, and it will then address the expert testimony concerning the stage of the cancer\n\nat that point. See Flores-Hernandez v. United States, 910 F. Supp. 2d at 77–78 (stating that\n\n“[t]he question is not solely whether [the plaintiff] already had cancer” at the time of the alleged\n\nnegligence, but whether if the physician had complied with the national standard of care, “the\n\ncourse of treatment she received would have led to the treatment and eradication of her condition\n\nsooner, before it advanced to Stage IVA”).\n\n                       a) Reevaluation of the Plaintiff Within Thirty to Sixty Days of The\n                          December 3, 2009 visit Would Likely Have Resulted in Diagnosis of\n                          Her Cancer Between January and July 2010.\n\n       As already pointed out, the defendant presented no expert opinion that would dispute the\n\nplaintiff’s position that her cancer would have been diagnosed earlier had Dr. Hill-Daniel\n\nsatisfied the standard of care at the December 3, 2009 visit. While conceding this point, the\n\ndefendant relies upon the testimony of its expert Dr. Feigert that by December 2009, the\n\nplaintiff’s cancer was already at such an advanced stage that it would have been incurable no\n\nmatter what Dr. Hill-Daniel had done at that appointment. Nonetheless, since the plaintiff bears\n\nthe burden of proof on all aspects of her claim, the Court must still assess the sufficiency of the\n\nplaintiff’s evidence on this question, and the Court finds that the evidence demonstrates to a\n\nreasonable degree of medical certainty that had Dr. Hill-Daniel scheduled an appointment for the\n\nplaintiff to return for re-evaluation of her breast complaints within thirty to sixty days after\n\nDecember 3, 2009, the plaintiff’s cancer would have been diagnosed sometime between January\n\nand July 2010.\n\n\n                                                      93\n\f       First, it is clear to the Court that had Dr. Hill-Daniel not told the plaintiff at the December\n\n3, 2009 visit that her breast concerns were benign, but instead scheduled a follow-up\n\nappointment for the plaintiff in order to rule out the possibility of breast cancer, the plaintiff\n\nwould have attended the follow-up appointment and reported that the knot in her breast was still\n\npresent. The evidence at trial showed that the plaintiff attended every scheduled appointment\n\nwith her health care providers concerning her breast complaints. Moreover, the plaintiff raised\n\nthe concern about her breast in the first instance, and she obviously thought it was important\n\nenough to schedule and attend the initial visit, so the Court has no doubt that she would have\n\nattended the follow-up visit. In addition, the plaintiff testified that in January 2010, the knot in\n\nher left breast remained about the same as it had been in December. Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at\n\n20:5–:9 (“Q: And the lumps in your breasts were still there; is that correct? A: The knot in my\n\nleft breast? Q: Were still there; isn’t that correct? Q: Yeah. It was about the same.”). Even by\n\nApril 30, 2010, the knot in her left breast had not changed. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 83:24–:25\n\n(“Q: Was the knot still present? A: It was the same thing as from the first visit in 2009.”).\n\n       In addition, Dr. Sutherland testified that if Dr. Hill-Daniel had conducted another breast\n\nexamination thirty to sixty days after the December 3, 2009 appointment, Dr. Hill-Daniel would\n\nhave felt the mass in the plaintiff’s left breast. Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 50:10–:11 (“[M]y opinion\n\nis that Dr. Hill-Daniel would have felt the mass at that point[.]”); see also Trial Tr. ECF No. 70\n\nat 78:10–:13 (Dr. Margo’s testimony that Dr. Hill-Daniel “well may have felt something\n\n[abnormal in the plaintiff’s left breast] in January and/or April [2010]” given the outcome). The\n\nopinion of Dr. Feigert, the defendant’s expert, that by that time the plaintiff’s cancer was already\n\nStage III-B or Stage IV, only bolsters the credibility of Dr. Sutherland’s opinion that the knot\n\nwould have been palpable to Dr. Hill-Daniel in January or February of 2010.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      94\n\f       Regardless of whether Dr. Hill-Daniel would have felt the knot at the follow-up visit, the\n\nnational standard of care would have required Dr. Hill-Daniel to order a diagnostic ultrasound\n\nmerely on the grounds that the plaintiff’s symptoms had not changed with her menstrual cycle.\n\nId. at 77:4–:7 (Dr. Margo’s testimony that the reason that the patient should be followed up in\n\nfour to six weeks is to check whether the symptoms are actually cyclical in nature even if the\n\npatient told the physician that they were not cyclical because “sometimes people aren’t aware\n\nthat there’s a cyclical nature, even if there is, so that by waiting for another period, you can take\n\nthat into account as well”); Trial Tr. ECF No. 69 at 46:22–47:23 (Dr. Sutherland’s testimony that\n\nwhen a nonlactating woman presents with noncyclic breast pain, the national standard of care for\n\na family medicine doctor requires referral for diagnostic imaging).\n\n       The plaintiff presented adequate expert testimony that diagnostic imaging would have\n\nuncovered plaintiff’s cancer at that stage. Id. at 47:23–48:5 (Dr. Sutherland’s testimony that if\n\ndiagnostic imaging had been ordered at the December 3, 2009 visit, it is more likely than not that\n\nan ultrasound would have revealed a suspicious mass in the left breast). The defendant presented\n\nno evidence that disputed that opinion and, again, Dr. Feigert’s opinion that the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nwas already Stage III-B or Stage IV by that point supports Dr. Sutherland’s testimony that the\n\ncancer would have been visible on a diagnostic imaging test, such as an ultrasound.\n\n       Finally, it is likely that if Dr. Hill-Daniel had satisfied the national standard of care by\n\ncommunicating to the plaintiff the importance of the test and the appropriate timeframe for\n\nscheduling those tests, as well as encouraging, rather than impeding, her ability to have the tests\n\nperformed when scheduled, the plaintiff’s diagnostic process would have proceeded from\n\nultrasound referral to ultimate diagnosis in less time than the five months it eventually took. If\n\nultrasound referral to ultimate diagnosis had taken the mere two to three weeks that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     95\n\fplaintiff’s experts Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Margo testified that it should have taken, the plaintiff’s\n\ncancer would have been diagnosed sometime between January 18, 2010 (thirty days from\n\nDecember 3, 2009 plus an additional two weeks for diagnosis) and February 22, 2010 (sixty days\n\nfrom December 3, 2009 plus an additional three weeks for diagnosis). Even if it had taken five\n\nmonths to proceed from the ultrasound referral to the ultimate diagnosis, the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nwould have been diagnosed by July 1, 2010 (sixty days after December 3, 2009 plus an\n\nadditional five months for diagnosis).\n\n        Using the most conservative estimate, the Court concludes that plaintiff’s expert\n\ntestimony showed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that had Dr. Hill-Daniel satisfied\n\nthe national standard of care by scheduling a follow-up visit for the plaintiff thirty to sixty days\n\nafter December 3, 2009, the plaintiff’s breast cancer would have been diagnosed before July\n\n2010.\n\n                       b) The Plaintiff’s Cancer was Stage I Until Sometime Before July 2010 at\n                          the Earliest, When it Progressed to Stage II.\n\n        The Court must next determine whether the plaintiff’s expert testimony showed, to a\n\nreasonable degree of medical certainty, that her cancer would have been less advanced than\n\nStage IV if it had been diagnosed before July 1, 2010. At the outset, the parties do not dispute\n\nthat the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis is the best predictor of prognosis. See Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 55 at 21:24–22:1 (Dr. Tucker); see also 3rd FOF Table ¶ 345–46 (listing as “not disputed”\n\nthe facts: (1) “Most of the outcome of breast cancer is determined by the AJCC stage,” and\n\n(2) “[AJCC] stage is the single most important predictor of outcome”). The experts in this case\n\npresented two completely divergent opinions on the issue of the staging of the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nin December 2009 and in the few months following that visit. Specifically, the plaintiff’s\n\nexperts, Dr. Tucker and Dr. Pushkas, testified that the plaintiff’s breast cancer was Stage I at the\n\n\n\n                                                     96\n\fDecember 3, 2009 visit and remained Stage I until at least July 2010. The defendant’s expert,\n\nDr. Fiegert, testified that the plaintiff’s breast cancer was already Stage III-B – meaning it had\n\ninvaded her skin – or even more likely Stage IV – meaning that the distant metastasis beyond the\n\nbreast was widespread – at the time of her December 2009 visit. The Court finds the opinions of\n\nplaintiff’s expert Dr. Tucker to be entirely persuasive, and corroborated by Dr. Pushkas. 20\n\n         Dr. Tucker’s opinions about the progression of the plaintiff’s cancer are supported in\n\nseveral ways. First, his opinions are straightforward and consistent. As a general matter, he\n\nfounded his opinions in the scientific and medical literature, and did not overstate the\n\nconclusiveness of new and untested scientific conclusions. For example, he testified on direct\n\nexamination that cancers have a relatively uniform growth rate, but that the growth rate may\n\nincrease as a small tumor gets larger, especially as the tumor becomes metastatic. Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 55 at 31:22–32:4. This influenced his conclusion that the growth rate of the plaintiff’s\n\ncancer may have increased over time. Id. at 64:1–:6. At the same time, he acknowledged that\n\nthe variations were relatively small and that to try to determine how the growth rate of a\n\nparticular tumor might change “would be conjecture.” Id. at 32:1–:4. As a result, he used the\n\nmore conservative linear growth rate to extrapolate the size of the plaintiff’s tumor in December\n\n2009 from measurements that were taken in 2011. Id. at 34:13–:21, 36:3–:8 (“[T]his would be a\n\nlinear scale proportionate linear scale on calendar days from this point on.”). During cross-\n\nexamination, Dr. Tucker was steady and consistent, as illustrated by the following unsuccessful\n\nattempt by defense counsel to impeach him:\n\n                Q: . . . You have testified during your deposition and stated in your report\n         not only that Ms. Rhodes’ cancer was growing very rapidly between December\n\n\n20\n  Although both Dr. Tucker and Dr. Pushkas testified that the plaintiff had Stage I breast cancer in December 2009,\nand that it did not progress to Stage II until July 2010, at the earliest, the Court will rely on the expert opinion of Dr.\nTucker because he provided a more comprehensive foundation for his opinions.\n\n\n                                                                 97\n\f       2009 and the time of the diagnosis in March 2011, but that the growth rate was\n       accelerating, correct?\n               A: More likely than not, it probably was accelerating, yes.\n               Q: And you have stated that the cancer started out as a low grade cancer,\n       but that it transformed into a higher grade cancer over time, correct?\n               A: No, that is a mischaracterization of my deposition testimony. I never\n       said that it was a low grade cancer. My deposition testimony was that it may have\n       been a lower grade at some point in time, but I don’t believe that it was ever a low\n       grade cancer. We just don’t see that.\n\nId. at 64:1–:14. Moreover, Dr. Tucker grounded his opinion in the scientific literature: he cited\n\nan article from the American Journal of Roentgenology, which – despite defense counsel’s\n\nskepticism, id. at 65:25–69:6, – appears to the Court to support his conclusions. Pl.’s Ex. 52, at\n\nD-46 (table summarizing the histological grade of cancer by size and pattern).\n\n       What most distinguishes Dr. Tucker’s and Dr. Feigert’s opinions regarding the stage of\n\nthe plaintiff’s cancer in December 2009, is that Dr. Tucker’s opinion corresponds with the\n\nmedical evidence that was presented at trial, whereas Dr. Feigert’s opinion simply does not. Cf.\n\nFlores-Hernandez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (finding expert witness’s opinions to be not credible\n\nin part because they were inconsistent with the medical evidence presented at trial). First, it is\n\nundisputed that by the end of March 2011, the cancer had metastasized to approximately eight\n\nbony sites in the plaintiff’s right shoulder and left scapula, which, Dr. Tucker testified, is\n\nrelatively few for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 50:2–:13; see\n\nalso Pl.’s Ex. 8 at 8097; 3rd FOF Table ¶ 374. There was no evidence of visceral involvement,\n\nmeaning involvement of the brain, lungs, liver, or other body sites. Id. at 50:14–:15. In addition,\n\nthe report from the May 12, 2011 MRI of the plaintiff’s pelvis notes that the results were\n\n“suspicious for early bone metastatic disease.” Pl.’s Ex. 21 at 1. The radiologist who read the\n\nMRI and wrote the report, Dr. Bowers, testified at trial that the lesions on the pelvis were not\n\nvisible on the March 2011 CT scan and bone scan, which had been taken just two months earlier.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      98\n\fTrial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 54:3–:18. He testified that in his experience, these circumstances\n\ndemonstrate that the metastasis had been present for less than a year and probably less than six\n\nmonths. 21\n\n         Second, the defendant produced no evidence that the plaintiff had any physical\n\nmanifestations of metastases until October 18, 2010, when Dr. Hill-Daniel palpated possible\n\nlymph node involvement, despite the fact that multiple medical providers examined her breast\n\ncomplaints between December 2009 and October 2010. A brief review of this evidence,\n\nincluding the testimony of the plaintiff’s actual treating physicians and their documented\n\nobservations of the plaintiff’s condition in her medical records, demonstrate the purely\n\nspeculative and unsupported nature of Dr. Feigert’s opinion.\n\n         Multiple experts, including the defendant’s expert, Dr. Bethea, testified that the spread of\n\ncancer to the lymph nodes is often detected by palpation of lymph nodes in the axilla, or armpit.\n\nSee Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 58:19–:22 (plaintiff’s expert Dr. Margo’s testimony that if a\n\nphysician feels a lymph node, it is worrisome because it can indicate lymph node involvement);\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 73 at 24:22–:25 (defendant’s expert Dr. Bethea testifying that “no\n\nlympdenopathy” – or no palpable lymph nodes – “says there’s no evidence of cancer that has\n\nspread to the axilla. That’s one of the areas or sites of spread of cancer.”); Trial Tr. ECF No. 56\n\nat 75:4–:5 (plaintiff’s expert Dr. Pushkas testifying that “palpable lymph nodes are more likely to\n\nbe involved than non-palpable lymph nodes”). Yet, the first physical evidence of lymph node\n\ninvolvement is Dr. Hill-Daniel’s notation in the progress note for the plaintiff’s October 18, 2011\n\nvisit: “palpable LN in L Axilla.” Pl.’s Ex. 1, at 1024.\n\n\n\n\n21\n  The Court notes, however, that it is not entirely clear whether this statement referred to the plaintiff’s metastatic\ndisease generally or only to the two metastasis sites in her pelvis. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 56:1–:11.\n\n\n                                                                99\n\f        Similarly, plaintiff’s expert Dr. Pushkas testified that metastasis to the skin often has\n\nvisible signs. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 80:21–81:2 (Dr. Pushkas’s testimony that skin\n\ninvolvement is “usually visible” and can look like ulcerations or nodules on the skin or can\n\nsometimes make the skin look like the skin of an orange”). Even Dr. Feigert testified that while\n\nmicroscopic involvement of the skin might not show any changes to the surface of the skin, gross\n\ninfiltration can cause thickening or hardening or nodules on the skin. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at\n\n39:12–:19. Yet, at the plaintiff’s December 3, 2009 visit to Unity, Dr. Hill-Daniel detected no\n\npalpable lymph nodes and no evidence of discoloration or hardening of the skin. Moreover, Dr.\n\nCarter, who examined the plaintiff at Howard University Hospital in May, 2010, did not make\n\nany notations about palpable lymph nodes or abnormalities in the skin despite making thorough\n\nnotations about the nodules he palpated in the plaintiff’s breasts. See Pl.’s Ex. 104. Likewise,\n\nthe healthcare provider who examined the plaintiff at Fort Washington Hospital on August 9,\n\n2010, did not note any palpable lymph nodes or lesions. While the defendant asserts that there is\n\npurportedly a note on the Fort Washington Medical Center record that there were “lesions”\n\npresent on the plaintiff’s breast, 3rd FOF Table ¶ 432(B), no such notation is apparent on the\n\nrecord that was admitted into evidence. Pl.’s Ex. 6. In fact, the record of the visit contains a\n\nprinted portion that says, “Return to the ER if you feel worse or if you have any problems. You\n\nshould especially return if you develop any of the symptoms circled below.” Pl.’s Ex. 6, at 6004.\n\nTwo of the options were “worse redness” and “worse swelling,” but the provider circled only\n\n“redness” and “swelling,” and excluded the word “worse,” suggesting that the plaintiff did not\n\nhave those symptoms at the time of her visit. Id. The provider also wrote “skin ulceration”\n\nunder the list of symptoms that should trigger a return visit, suggesting that he or she detected no\n\nsigns of skin infiltration. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     100\n\f         Finally, the plaintiff’s treating oncologist, Dr. Yoo, testified that the plaintiff’s bony\n\nmetastases have caused her acute pain at the metastasis sites. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 46:3–:8,\n\n47:14–:18, 50:2–:25, 51:14–52:13. Even Dr. Feigert agreed that “maybe other patients don’t\n\nhave painful bony metastatic disease, but we know the plaintiff does.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at\n\n90:22–:24 (“Sadly she does, that’s correct.”). Yet, for the ten month period between December\n\n2009 and October 2010, no medical record for the plaintiff documents any complaint about bone\n\npains, undermining Dr. Feigert’s opinion that her cancer had already metastasized to such an\n\nextent as Stage IV. 22\n\n         In an apparent effort to get around the lack of any medical evidence supporting his\n\nopinion, Dr. Feigert testified that in December 2009, the metastases might have been only a\n\nsingle malignant cell that had spread to the skin or bones, and that such a small-scale spread\n\nwould not necessarily cause symptoms. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 95:13–:21. He did not\n\nadequately explain, however, why the plaintiff had no symptoms associated with a metastatic\n\nbreast cancer for the next ten months. 23\n\n\n\n\n22\n  In addition, Dr. Feigert’s opinion that the plaintiff’s cancer had already spread to her skin by December 2009 was\nbased primarily on what he described as the extensive infiltration of the breast cancer to the plaintiff’s skin ten\nmonths later, in October 2010. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 31:15–:18. That description, however, is simply not\nsupported by the record. No reference to “discoloration” of the breast is contained in the progress note for the\nplaintiff’s October 18, 2010 appointment, Pl.’s Ex. 1 at 1024; Def.’s Ex. 1 at 12, despite Dr. Hill-Daniel’s\nrecollection during her testimony that the “first thing [she] noticed” at the plaintiff’s October 18, 2010 appointment\nwas that she had a discoloration over the left breast. Trial Tr. ECF No. 58 at 27:10–:12. The only notation in the\nprogress note that might suggest skin involvement states “multiple scars on L breast some overlying nodules,” but\nneither party provided testimony about the meaning of this notation, and whatever Dr. Hill-Daniel observed did not\nprompt her to the conclusion that the plaintiff had such advanced breast cancer that it had progressed to “extensive\ninfiltration” of the skin. The Court also notes that the defendant’s assertion in the FOF Table that “[i]n October of\n2010, Dr. Hill-Daniel is able to palpate ‘obvious evidence of gross skin infiltration’ on Ms. Rhodes’ skin and she\ndescribes it in her October 2010 note” is misleading as those words – “obvious evidence of gross skin infiltration” –\nare not written or described in the progress note for the October 18, 2010 visit. See 3rd FOF Table ¶ 430(B).\n23\n  Perhaps Dr. Feigert expected the Court to find his opinion more credible, despite the lack of corroborating medical\nevidence in the plaintiff’s medical records, in light of his view that her cancer had a slow to average growth rate.\nFor the reasons that will be explained below, the Court also does not find his views on the growth rate of the cancer\nto be persuasive.\n\n\n                                                             101\n\f       The Court is satisfied that Dr. Tucker provided a sufficient scientific and medical\n\nfoundation for his opinion that the plaintiff’s breast cancer was Stage I between December 2009\n\nand July 2010. He estimated the size of the plaintiff’s tumor by extrapolating from the size as\n\nmeasured in three different studies – an ultrasound, CT scan, and PET CT scan – and a linear\n\ngrowth rate, which both parties agree best characterizes the way that cancer tumors grow, 3rd\n\nFOF Table ¶ 354. He further testified that the conclusion he reached about the small size of the\n\ntumor in December 2009 was consistent with the high growth rate of the cancer, as illustrated by\n\nthe high grade on the AJCC-endorsed Nottingham grading system that the radiologist who read\n\nthe plaintiff’s ultrasound report assessed it to have. His opinion that the plaintiff had no nodal\n\ninvolvement or distant metastases on December 3, 2009, was based on the evidence that Dr. Hill-\n\nDaniel did not palpate any lymph nodes at the December 3, 2009 visit or see any evidence of\n\nspreading to the skin, and that the plaintiff did not complain of any symptoms that are associated\n\nwith lymph node or distant metastasis. No physical evidence of lymph node involvement is\n\ncorroborated by the low probability of lymph node involvement with a one centimeter tumor.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 44:24–45:1 (“85 percent of patients even with a high grade one\n\ncentimeter invasive duct cancer, don’t have lymph node metastases.”).\n\n       Defendant unconvincingly challenges the scientific foundation for this opinion by\n\nattacking Dr. Tucker’s method of estimating the cancer’s growth rate. To determine relative\n\ngrowth rate, Dr. Tucker relied on the tumor’s overall histological grade on the AJCC-endorsed\n\nNottingham grading system. According to Dr. Tucker, the fact that the plaintiff’s cancer has the\n\nhighest Nottingham grade of 3 indicates that it is a fast growing cancer. Dr. Feigert, on the other\n\nhand, testified that while the overall Nottingham grade conveys the “aggressiveness” of the\n\ncancer, which he defined as the potential to invade the blood stream and spread into the body,\n\n\n\n\n                                                    102\n\fTrial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 48:12–:18, the growth rate is controlled by one particular component of\n\nthe grade: the mitotic rate, which is the number of cells dividing at one point in time. Id. at\n\n48:7–:8. According to Dr. Feigert, while the high Nottingham grade of the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nshowed that it was aggressive, its mitotic rate score of 2 out of a potential score of 3 indicated\n\nthat it does not have a particularly high growth rate. Id. at 46:12–:15, 46:22–47:14. Dr. Feigert\n\ncited the low expression of a substance called Ki-67 in the plaintiff’s cancer cells, which is a\n\nmeasure of the cancer cells’ expression of synthesizing DNA, as suggesting that its growth rate\n\nwas slow to average. Id. at 51:8–:19.\n\n       By contrast to Dr. Feigert’s reliance on mitotic rate, Dr. Tucker provided a convincing\n\nscientific argument for why mitotic rate alone is not an accepted way of measuring growth rate.\n\nDr. Tucker explained that many cancer cells may have defective DNA, so despite the appearance\n\nof many cells dividing, not many will survive. Thus, even if the mitotic rate is elevated, that\n\nmight not correspond to tumor growth directly. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 61:10–:23. Dr. Tucker’s\n\ntestimony was both consistent and grounded in the AJCC guidelines, which do not parse out\n\nmitotic cell division scores to evaluate a tumor’s prognosis but rely on a combination of three\n\nattributes. See id. at 25:23–:25 (“It is the combination of these three attributes together in this\n\nscoring system that has the greatest correlation with growth rate.”); id. at 58:15–:19 (“We do not\n\nuse the individual features to determine prognosis. Prognosis is solely derived from the\n\ncombined score. It is not allowed to pick out individual attributes and make judgments on\n\noutcome or growth rate or prognosis based on solitary findings.”); id. at 61:10–:12 (“[A]s I said\n\nwith the other attributes, we can’t take the individual characteristics and draw conclusions about\n\ngrowth rate from them[.]”). Even Dr. Feigert admitted that in practice, pathologists utilize the\n\noverall Nottingham grade to predict tumor growth without parsing out the individual components\n\n\n\n\n                                                     103\n\fof the system. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 78:5–:18. At one point, Dr. Feigert also admitted that the\n\ngrade reflects both the aggressiveness of the cancer and its growth potential. Id. at 78:5–:7.\n\n         Dr. Tucker also convincingly and unwaveringly testified that despite the label of Ki-67 as\n\na “proliferation marker,” Ki-67 expression is a prognostic indicator that tells doctors whether a\n\npatient would be likely to benefit from chemotherapy. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 63:12–:25. The\n\nway that many chemotherapy drugs work is by disrupting DNA synthesis, so if the cancer shows\n\na high Ki-67 expression, it is more likely that those drugs will work with that particular type of\n\ncancer. Id. Even Dr. Feigert admitted that the AJCC has rejected the incorporation of\n\nproliferation markers such as Ki-67 in its staging system, and instead relies on the Nottingham\n\ngrading system with reliance of multiple attributes to predict growth rate. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57\n\nat 76:11–78:6. Dr. Feigert did not produce any medical protocol that accepted Ki-67 expression\n\nas a reliable measure of growth rate in the manner that he was using it as a basis of his opinion. 24\n\n         It is also worth mentioning that several aspects of Dr. Feigert’s testimony cast doubt on\n\nthe reliability of his opinions. First, cross-examination revealed that Dr. Feigert submitted two\n\nvery different expert reports – one dated December 15, 2012, and a second dated February 15,\n\n2013. Id. at 74:10–:16. The first report characterized the plaintiff’s cancer as “very aggressive,”\n\ncontained no mention of Ki-67, and did not characterize the plaintiff’s cancer as slow-growing.\n\n24\n   Dr. Feigert and Dr. Tucker also disagreed about what imaging test provides the most reliable measurement of\ntumor size. The measurements that Dr. Tucker relied on were derived from ultrasound and CT scan images,\nwhereas the measurements that Dr. Feigert relied on were derived from MRI images. The CT scan images from\nMarch 24 and March 28, 2011 showed the size of the plaintiff’s tumor as 2.8 centimeters and 2.6 centimeters,\nrespectively. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 33:24–34:12. The MRI image from April 4, 2011 showed the size of the\nplaintiff’s tumor as up to 10 centimeters. Trial Tr. ECF No. 57 at 38:8–:10, 44:3–:5; Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 44:10–\n:17. Dr. Tucker testified that MRI imaging provides a good measure of overall tumor size, but it is not used for\npurposes of grading the tumor under the AJCC system. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 38:10–:15. That is because the\nstaging system is only concerned with invasive cancer, not cancer with no potential to spread (called carcinoma in\nsitu). According to Dr. Tucker, the MRI test is not used for staging purposes because it shows both invasive cancer\nas well as carcinoma in situ. Id. at 36:13–:20. Ultrasound is the preferred method for staging purposes because\nultrasound is not as good at picking up carcinoma in situ. Id. The Court is inclined to accept Dr. Tucker’s opinion\nbecause it found his opinions generally more grounded in the plaintiff’s medical records than those of Dr. Feigert;\nhowever, it need not resolve this particular dispute because the defendant did not specifically challenge Dr. Tucker’s\nestimation of tumor size; it only disputed whether any cancer had spread beyond the left breast before July 2010.\n\n\n                                                             104\n\fId. at 74:19–75:14. Only in the second report – submitted a mere two months after the first – did\n\nDr. Feigert parse the definition of an “aggressive” cancer, and opine that the plaintiff’s cancer\n\nwas slow-growing. Id. at 75:11–:14. In addition, there were significant inconsistencies in how\n\nDr. Feigert characterized the extent of the plaintiff’s cancer in December 2009. He\n\nacknowledged at trial that his report described “extensive progression of bony metastatic disease\n\nin December of 2009.” Id. at 90:20–:21. Yet, to explain how the plaintiff remained generally\n\nfree of symptoms of metastatic cancer (e.g., no lymph node involvement, no skin involvement,\n\nand no bone pains), he testified that “it reflects the fact that many patients with metastatic breast\n\ncancer don’t have symptoms. Certainly now when it’s microscopic.” Id. at 90:16–:19. These\n\ninconsistencies trigger concern about the bases of his opinions.\n\n       The Court acknowledges that it is impossible to know with certainty the stage of the\n\nplaintiff’s cancer in December 2009 because no imaging or other testing was performed at that\n\ntime. The negligence standard does not require absolute certainty, however, but only a\n\nreasonable degree of certainty. Sponaugle v. Pre-Term, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367 (D.C. 1980)\n\n(“While absolute certainty is not required, opinion evidence that is conjectural or speculative is\n\nnot permitted.”). Accordingly, the Court finds, based on Dr. Tucker’s expert opinions, that\n\nplaintiff has proved the following to a reasonable degree of medical certainty:\n\n           •   On December 3, 2009, the plaintiff’s tumor was between one centimeter and one\n\n               and a half centimeters in diameter, giving her a T value of 1 on the AJCC scale.\n\n           •   On December 3, 2009, the plaintiff’ had no nodal involvement, giving her an N\n\n               value of 0 on the AJCC scale.\n\n           •   On December 3, 2009, the plaintiff had no distant metastases, giving her an M\n\n               value of 0 on the AJCC scale.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     105\n\f            •   Because a T1/N0/M0 breast cancer corresponds to Stage I on the AJCC staging\n\n                scale, the plaintiff had Stage I breast cancer on December 3, 2009.\n\n            •   The earliest that the plaintiff’ breast cancer became Stage II was July 2010.\n\n        Since the Court has already found that the plaintiff met her burden of showing by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s satisfaction of the national standard of care\n\nwould have led to a diagnosis of the plaintiff’s breast cancer by July 1, 2010 at the very latest,\n\nand the plaintiff has shown with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that her cancer still\n\nwould have been at Stage I at that point, the Court finds that plaintiff has proven that had Dr.\n\nHill-Daniel satisfied the national standard of care, it is more likely than not that the plaintiff’s\n\ncancer would have been diagnosed at Stage I.\n\n                2.      If the plaintiff’s Breast Cancer Had Been Diagnosed at Stage I, the\n                        Treatment She Would Have Received Would Likely Have Cured It.\n\n        Finally, the Court concludes that plaintiff’s evidence at trial demonstrated that had the\n\nplaintiff’s breast cancer been diagnosed at Stage I, it is more likely than not that the treatment\n\nshe would have received would have cured it. See Ferrell, 691 A.2d at 651–52 (stating that to\n\ndetermine whether the negligence was a “substantial factor” in causing the harm, a court must\n\nfind that there was a substantial possibility of survival and that the defendant destroyed it).\n\nPlaintiff’s expert Dr. Pushkas testified that overall survival for Stage I breast cancer is 98%.\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 77:14–:16. His opinion is grounded in statistics from the SEER Survival\n\nMonograph for breast cancer, a compilation of over 300,000 cases reported from all over the\n\nUnited States. Id. at 63:13–:19. Defendant does not dispute Dr. Pushkas’s testimony that the\n\nSEER Survival Monograph is a reliable and authoritative source for determining the probability\n\nof survival from breast cancer in its various stages. 3rd FOF Table ¶ 390 (citing Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 56 at 63:5–:11). Moreover, Dr. Tucker testified that a Stage I lesion has a cure rate in the\n\n\n\n                                                      106\n\forder of about 80 to 85% over five years, Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 11:18–:19, and that it is\n\ntreatable for cure in a great majority of cases. Id. at 47:5–:9. Although Dr. Feigert testified that\n\nnot all patients with Stage I disease survive, he acknowledged that “most do.” Trial Tr. ECF No.\n\n57 at 49:21–:23. He also testified that the plaintiff’s cancer is subtype Luminal A, which\n\ngenerally carries the highest survival rates of all forms of cancer, and that it has other biological\n\nfeatures that are characteristic of favorable prognosis. Id. at 69:1–:14. This expert testimony\n\nsatisfies the Court that had the plaintiff’s cancer been diagnosed and treated at Stage I, it is more\n\nlikely than not that it would have been cured. Since the plaintiff’s cancer was not diagnosed\n\nuntil it was Stage IV, however, all of the experts, as well as the plaintiff’s treating oncologist,\n\nagreed that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s negligence eliminated any possibility that Ms. Hill-Daniel will\n\nsurvive her disease. Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 12:1–:2 (Dr. Tucker); Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 23:9–\n\n:16 (Dr. Yoo); 3rd FOF Table ¶ 11 (listing as “not disputed” the fact that “Stage IV breast cancer\n\nis incurable”).\n\n       Accordingly, the Court finds that Dr. Hill-Daniel’s negligence is more likely than not to\n\nhave been a proximate cause of the injuries the plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer\n\nas a result of having incurable breast cancer.\n\n       D.         Damages\n\n       In determining the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, the Court is guided\n\nby the fundamental principle underlying the “American rule on damages” as set forth in the\n\n“seminal case” of Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101671\"><a href=\"/opinion/101671/story-parchment-co-v-paterson-parchment-paper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1931).\n\nHill v.

Cir. 2003). In Story Parchment Co., the\n\nSupreme Court stated:\n\n       Where the tort itself is of such a nature as to preclude the ascertainment of the\n       amount of damages with certainty, it would be a perversion of fundamental\n\n\n\n                                                     107\n\f       principles of justice to deny all relief to the injured person, and thereby relieve the\n       wrong-doer from making any amend for his acts. In such case, while the damages\n       may not be determined by mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if the\n       evidence show the extent of damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference,\n       although the result be only approximate.\n\n\n282 U.S. at 562. The Supreme Court emphasized “the clear distinction” in the standard of proof\n\nnecessary to establish a plaintiff’s entitlement to damages and to assess the amount of those\n\ndamages. Id. (“[T]here is a clear distinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish\n\nthe fact that petitioner had sustained some damage, and the measure of proof necessary to enable\n\nthe jury to fix the amount”). While a plaintiff must prove entitlement to damages with\n\nreasonable certainty or preponderance of the evidence, proof of the amount of damages only\n\nrequires a reasonable estimate.

At the outset, the Court finds that\n\nthe plaintiff has proven she is entitled to damages in all five categories. “[A] plaintiff may\n\nrecover damages for past economic losses if such losses are ‘reasonably proved,’ while a\n\nplaintiff may recover for future harm only by a reasonable certainty or preponderance of the\n\nevidence.” Hill, 328 F. 3d at 684.

Def.’s Ex. 36 at\n\n30:11–:17 (“I used . . . the number of years that Ms. Patterson estimated . . . and she said that Ms.\n\nRhodes would need one and a half years of future care costs.”); Pl.’s Ex. 53 at 10 (projecting\n\ncosts for future care through the end of the plaintiff’s life). It is equally beyond dispute that the\n\nplaintiff will suffer some amount of lost wages, incur costs through the loss of household\n\nservices, and incur non-economic damages for pain and suffering. Thus, each of the future costs\n\nis “reasonably certain” to occur. Therefore, the only issue before the Court is the amount of\n\ndamages to award for these future costs.\n\n       The Court explains below the basis for its ruling on the amount of damages in each of\n\nthese categories.\n\n               1.      Past Medical Expenses\n\n       The parties have stipulated that the plaintiff’s medical bills included in the plaintiff’s\n\nExhibit 31, totaling $33,285.17, “are fair and reasonable and that they are related to medical\n\nservices that were made necessary as a result of the evolution of Miss Rhodes’ cancer into stage\n\nIV.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 70 at 8:22–9:11. This amount apparently excludes those medical\n\n\n\n\n                                                     110\n\fexpenses, which had originally been part of the plaintiff’s claim for past medical expenses but\n\nthe parties agreed were “not properly recoverable.” Id. at 8:11–:13. It is axiomatic that a\n\ndefendant is only liable for those damages proximately caused by the defendant’s actions. See,\n\ne.g., Monzel, 641 F.3d at 535; cf. Graham v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"296318\"><a href=\"/opinion/296318/raymond-graham-v-vernell-r-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 997 n.3 (D.C.

See Trial Tr. ECF No.70 8:22–9:11. Therefore, the Court awards past medical\n\nexpenses to the plaintiff for all of these medical bills, in the total amount of $33,285.17.\n\n                  2.        Future Care Costs\n\n         Both parties’ economics experts based their opinions about the cost of the plaintiff’s\n\nfuture care at least in part on the recommendations of the plaintiff’s rehabilitation nurse expert,\n\nNurse Patterson, and the plaintiff’s social worker, Mila Tecala. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 24:5–:9;\n\nDef’s Ex. 36 at 30:11–:17. 25 Nevertheless, the estimates for future care costs differ due to\n\n\n25\n  The parties generally agree on the cost the plaintiff will incur for outpatient hospice case, (the plaintiff’s expert\nestimates $18,000 and the defendant’s expert estimates $17,516), and the cost of medical consultations (the\n\n\n                                                               111\n\fdifferences in the cost estimates for: (1) psychological services (ranging from a lower bound\n\nestimated by the defendant’s expert to be $2,932, and an upper bound estimated by the plaintiff’s\n\nexpert to be $12,814); (2) the cost of a home health aide (estimated by the defendant’s expert to\n\nbe $32,980 and by the plaintiff’s expert to be $49,680); and (3) the cost for inpatient hospice care\n\n(estimated by the defendant’s expert to be $35,032 and by the plaintiff’s expert to be $63,152).\n\nSee Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 4; Def.’s Ex. 37 at 20.\n\n         The method used by the defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, to estimate future care costs is\n\nunconvincing. For counseling and for a home health aide, Dr. Hurdle makes a fundamental error\n\nin logic. Dr. Hurdle calculated the costs for these services using the average wages for a person\n\nin the home health and counseling fields. Def.’s Ex. 37 at 16–18. By Dr. Hurdle’s logic, the\n\nplaintiff would be required to enter the employment market, hire her own counselor and home\n\nhealth aide as employees, and pay them the average hourly wage in the District of Columbia\n\n(including “legally required benefits”). See id. The Court will not require the plaintiff to\n\nbecome an employer in order to meet her health care needs. It is far more logical that the\n\nplaintiff will use a service to obtain home health care and counseling assistance, and that the\n\nservice will charge her, as a client, the market rate for this special assistance. The plaintiff’s\n\nexperts correctly calculated the costs of her future home health care and counseling service on\n\nthis basis rather than based on the amount that the services pay to their employees in wages, as\n\nthe defendant’s expert suggests. See Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 4; Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:20–:25; 95:1–\n\n:7.\n\n\n\n\nplaintiff’s expert estimates $6,240 and the defendant’s expert estimates $6,108). See Pl.’s Ex. 54, at 4; Def.’s Ex.\n37, at 18–19. The differences are accounted for by the application of slightly different inflation rates by each\nestimate. See id. The total of these additional services is $24,240 from the plaintiff’s expert’s estimate and $23, 624\nfor the defendant’s expert’s estimate. See id.\n\n\n                                                             112\n\f       The method used by the plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Lurito, to estimate the cost of a home\n\nhealth aide and individual counseling is far more realistic. He relied upon Nurse Patterson’s\n\ncalculations, which are derived from the recommendation of a counselor, who based these costs\n\non her knowledge of actual costs in this area for these services, Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:20–\n\n:22, and the expertise of Nurse Patterson, an undisputed expert in the field of nurse rehabilitation\n\nwho provides life care planning, case management and care coordination. Id. at 93:7–:19.\n\n       In estimating the cost of in-patient hospice care, Dr. Hurdle’s reasoning is, again, flawed.\n\nBy contrast to the plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Hurdle declined to accept Nurse Patterson’s cost\n\nestimate, which was based on the cost of the specific hospice facility recommended by the\n\nplaintiff’s treating physician. Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:22–:25. Instead, Dr. Hurdle posited\n\nthat, if in-patient hospice care is necessary, the plaintiff “could go to a nursing home and receive\n\noutpatient hospice care at that nursing home.” Def.’s Ex. 37 at 19. She then used a private\n\ninsurance company study of the 2012 market rates in the Washington, D.C. area to determine the\n\nminimal cost for a nursing home at $200 a day. Yet, she admits in her report that the same study\n\nindicated the average cost of a nursing home in the D.C. area is more than 30 percent higher than\n\n$200 a day and she uses this average cost as the upper bound for her calculations. See id. The\n\nCourt believes in-patient hospice care means hospice care in a hospice, not in an assisted living\n\nfacility designed for another purpose.\n\n       The difference in damage amount estimates between the plaintiff’s expert and the\n\ndefendant’s expert is the difference between reality and abstraction. The Court finds that Dr.\n\nLurito’s calculations are logical and reasonable based on actual surveys and health care expertise\n\nfrom practitioners. See Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 4; Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 94:20–:25; 95:1–:7. Dr.\n\nHurdle’s estimates, on the other hand, are based on theoretical economics that appear focused\n\n\n\n\n                                                    113\n\fonly on yielding the lowest possible cost. Such economic theory provides limited usefulness in\n\ncompensating the plaintiff for the very real and actual cost of health care she will need in the\n\nshort amount of time she has left to live. Therefore, the Court finds the plaintiff’s expert’s\n\nestimates of future health care costs to be reliably based on actual costs for the requisite services\n\nin this area, and awards $149,886 for this component of the damages award.\n\n               3.      Future Lost Earnings\n\n       The economics experts in this case developed widely divergent numbers when estimating\n\nthe value of the plaintiff’s future lost earnings. The estimate from the plaintiff’s expert, Dr.\n\nLurito, is $737,715, Trial Tr., ECF No. 71 at 15:22–:23, and the estimate from the defendant’s\n\nexpert, Dr. Hurdle, ranges from $106,020 to $129,219. Def.’s Ex. 37 at 20. The discrepancy in\n\nthe numbers results from three major differences in the two experts’ calculations: (1) the\n\ndeduction of “consumption” expenses, (2) the difference in discount rates, and (3) the difference\n\nin the estimated number of years the plaintiff would be expected to work. The Court discusses\n\neach of these differences below.\n\n                       a) Consumption Expenses\n\n       Consumption expenses account for the “things that [the plaintiff] personally would be\n\nusing, such as food, clothing, her own personal entertainment, her own personal health insurance\n\nor life insurance, things that are just related to her own personal expenditures that no longer\n\nwould be needed if she . . . had passed away.” Def.’s Ex. 36 at 15:22–25; 16:1–3. Dr. Hurdle\n\ndeducted these consumption expenses from the wages the plaintiff could be expected to earn. Id.\n\nat 15:9–12. Dr. Lurito did not. Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 19:22. Dr. Lurito bluntly explained that\n\nhis reason for not deducting consumption expenses was “[b]ecause Miss Rhodes is not dead.”\n\nId. at 19:24. That explanation is correct under District of Columbia law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     114\n\f       Lost wages “represent[] the amount that the injured party would have earned but for the\n\ninjury.” Moattar, 694 A.2d at 438 (quoting District of Columbia v. Barriteau, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n567 n.6 (D.C. 1979)). “The allowance for such recovery is consonant with the principal purpose\n\nfor compensatory damages in such cases, which is to make the victim whole.” Id. Consumption\n\nor personal maintenance expenses are typically deducted in wrongful death actions where “the\n\namount the deceased would have required to maintain himself” is deducted from a lost wages\n\nclaim. See Runyon v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"304705\"><a href=\"/opinion/304705/charles-e-runyon-of-the-estate-of-charles-b-runyon-deceased-v-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1322 (D.C.

These deductions are made because the money the deceased would have\n\nspent on personal maintenance during her lifetime “would not have been available to her estate.”\n\nBaker, 775 F. Supp. 2d at 79. This consideration simply does not come into play outside the\n\ncontext of a wrongful death action.\n\n       In a personal injury action, the party suing is the actual party injured and the recovery\n\nwill go to her. Thus, it makes no sense to deduct the plaintiff’s own consumption costs from her\n\naward, as she is the one who will be using the lost wages for maintenance of herself. The\n\nSupreme Court acknowledged this fundamental difference in Jones and Laughlin Steel\n\nCorporation v. Pfeifer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110971\"><a href=\"/opinion/110971/jones-laughlin-steel-corp-v-pfeifer/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983). In that case, the Supreme Court noted that lost\n\nwages are “intended to compensate the worker for the diminution” of her income stream. Id. at\n\n533. The Court pointed out that one difference between the lost wages awarded in a personal\n\ninjury action and those awarded in a wrongful death action is that the former benefits the injured\n\nparty while the latter benefits the injured party’s heirs. See id. at 533 n.8.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     115\n\f       In urging the Court to accept her analysis, the defendant’s expert noted that she used the\n\nmethodology of deducting consumption expenses in an estimate she prepared for the special\n\nmaster for distribution of the 9/11 Victim’s Fund. Def.’s Ex. 36, 17:6–:11. In that context, Dr.\n\nHurdle admits, however, that “the people that I was doing it for were already dead.” Id. at\n\n40:14–:16. Significantly, Dr. Hurdle testified that she has never deducted personal consumption\n\nexpenses before in a personal injury case. Id. at 41:15–:18 (“[P]ersonal consumption is only\n\ndeducted in a case where the person . . . whose income we are projecting is dead and not using\n\nthat portion of her income for her own benefit.”).\n\n       Nevertheless, the defendant persists in urging Dr. Hurdle’s deduction of personal\n\nconsumption from the lost wages award in this personal injury case. The defendant relies on\n\npure dictum in a footnote in George Washington University v. Waas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182 n.7\n\n(D.C. 1994), where the District of Columbia Court of Appeals briefly mentioned that an expert in\n\nthat case calculated the lost wages of a living victim with “an increase of 7% annually to account\n\nfor inflation, promotions and productive growth, and a reduction for state and federal taxes and\n\npersonal maintenance.” Def.’s Concls. at 21. No other analysis was offered in Waas regarding\n\nwhy the personal maintenance was deducted, under what circumstances such a deduction would\n\nbe appropriate, or why it mattered for the resolution of that case. Indeed, the computation of\n\ndamages was apparently not an issue before the court, which focused instead on whether the trial\n\ncourt appropriately gave a contributory negligence jury instruction to the jury. Waas, 648 A.2d\n\nat 179. This Court declines to give any weight to this dictum.\n\n       In any event, Waas predates Moattar v. Foxhall Surgical Associates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\n\n1997), where the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that, in a personal injury action,\n\nunlike in a wrongful death action, the appropriate measure of future economic damages is “the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     116\n\famount that the injured party would have earned but for the injury.” Moattar, 694 A.2d at 438.\n\nAt issue in Moattar was whether it was appropriate for a jury to consider the wages a plaintiff\n\nwould have earned had her life expectancy not been substantially shortened by the defendant\n\nphysician’s negligence. 26 Id. The court held that loss of future wages in a personal injury action\n\nis “not a premature attempt to recover wrongful death and survival damages . . . but an element\n\nof damages recoverably by the injured party during her lifetime,” even when the plaintiff’s\n\nimminent death was predicted. Id. at 437–38 (emphasis in original).\n\n         The defendant’s precise argument—that lost future income in a personal injury case\n\nshould be treated the same as it is treated in wrongful death actions—was clearly rejected by the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals in Moattar. Indeed, not even the dissent in Moattar\n\nagreed with the defendant’s argument, but instead expressly noted that damages for lost future\n\nwages “serve different purposes and are measured differently” when awarded to the living victim\n\non a personal injury claim than when awarded to survivors in a wrongful death claim. Id. at 444\n\nn.5 (King, J. dissenting). One difference in the measurement identified by the dissent is that\n\n“[p]ost-death economic damages represent the sum that would accrue to the estate,” and\n\n“[b]ecause the deceased has no living expenses,” those personal consumption expenses “must be\n\nsubtracted from the income determined to be lost.” Id. In short, the legal support in this\n\njurisdiction for the defendant’s proposed method of deducting consumption expenses from the\n\ndamages awarded for future lost wages on a personal injury action involving a plaintiff with a\n\n\n\n\n26\n   Expert testimony in Moattar indicated it was “more likely than not” that the plaintiff would die within four years\nof trial due to the delayed diagnosis of her breast cancer attributable to the defendant’s negligence. See Moattar,\n694 A.2d at 436–37.\n\n\n                                                             117\n\fshortened life span due to the defendant’s negligence, just as such expenses are deducted in\n\nwrongful death actions, is sparse to nonexistent. 27\n\n        The Court rejects the defense expert’s suggested consumption deduction. While such a\n\ndeduction has been applied in wrongful death actions, it is not appropriate in a personal injury\n\naction to deduct an amount to reflect the plaintiff’s personal consumption from the damages\n\nawarded for future lost wages.\n\n                          b) Discount Rates\n\n        The parties’ experts also dispute the discount rate that should apply to the plaintiff’s\n\naward. The discount rate is the amount an award is reduced to account for the investment\n\nincome an individual may make upon receipt of a lump sum award. See Dugar v. Wash. Metro\n\nArea Transit Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2461613\"><a href=\"/opinion/2461613/dugar-v-washington-metro-area-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126 n.11 (D.D.C. 2008) (explaining that the amount\n\nthat the injured party would have earned but for the injury “must be reduced to [its] present\n\nvalue, using a valid discount rate” to produce “the present value of the loss of future earnings”)\n\n(quoting District of Columbia v. Barriteau, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 n.6 (D.C. 1979)). The plaintiff’s\n\nexpert, Dr. Lurito, used a discount rate of 3.5 percent, which he considered to be “high in today’s\n\nmarket.” Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at 17:19–:21. He based his analysis on the amount of interest\n\nthat could be earned from investing the lump sum in United States government bonds, which,\n\naccording to Dr. Lurito, are yielding between 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent, based on the bond’s\n\nmaturity date. Id. at 18:20–:25.\n\n\n27\n  The defendant also cites Doe v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1446506\"><a href=\"/opinion/1446506/doe-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.R.I. 1990), for the proposition that\nconsumption must be deducted from estimates of lost wages in a personal injury action. Reliance on this case is\nmisplaced, however, for at least two reasons. First, the court in Doe was applying Rhode Island law, which makes\nthis case from outside this jurisdiction inapplicable. See Doe, 737 F. Supp. at 162 (applying Rhode Island law to\ndamages calculation). Second, the court in Doe adopted the government’s argument that, under the circumstances at\nissue in that case, the personal injury action was “more analogous to a wrongful death action in which deductions\nare made for the living expenses a decedent would have incurred” because of the plaintiff’s imminent death. See id.\nat 164. The defendant in this case has never made or even suggested an argument here that this case should be\nconverted into and treated as a wrongful death action. The Court therefore finds Doe unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                                           118\n\f        The defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, used an 8.98 percent discount rate, which\n\napproximately reflects the rate at which a person would be able to receive a credit card loan.\n\nDef.’s Ex. 36, at 20:5–:24; 21:14–:16. In Dr. Hurdle’s opinion, the higher discount rate “reflects\n\nthe riskiness of the future earnings that the plaintiff would have but for this injury.” Def. Ex. 36\n\nat 18:16–:18. Dr. Hurdle indicated that a discount rate that incorporates considerations of risk is\n\nused in the commercial context, because in determining what profit a company would have\n\nmade, “[i]t is pretty common now, I think, with respect to lost profit cases to consider the\n\nriskiness of the firm that is losing their profits.” Id. at 19:22–:25.\n\n        Dr. Hurdle did not testify that she had used this form of discount rate in any other\n\npersonal injury suit. Nor did the defendant point to a single personal injury case which used this\n\nmethod of essentially bumping-up the discount rate to account for risk. Indeed, in support of Dr.\n\nHurdle’s novel theory, the defendant cites only a single case from outside this jurisdiction that,\n\nironically, declined to incorporate risk into the discount rate. See O’Shea v. Riverway Towing\n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403693\"><a href=\"/opinion/403693/margaret-oshea-v-riverway-towing-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201 (7th Cir. 1982) (upholding jury award where damages were calculated\n\nusing only inflation rate and real interest rate with no additional discount for risk).\n\n        The Supreme Court has been clear as to how the discount rate should be determined,\n\nstating: “The discount rate should be based on the rate of interest that would be earned on ‘the\n\nbest and safest investments.’” Pfeifer, 462 U.S. at 537 (quoting Chesapeake & Ohio Ry.

Trial Tr. ECF No. 71 at\n\n18:11–:25. The Court concludes that Dr. Lurito’s discount rate has a firm and reliable basis that\n\ncomports with the legal principles for application of a discount rate set forth in Pfeifer.\n\n                       c) Working Life\n\n       The final major difference between the two expert economists’ assumptions in\n\ndetermining the plaintiff’s future lost wages is the estimated length of time that the plaintiff\n\nwould continue working but for the defendant’s negligence. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Lurito,\n\nbased his estimate of 38.8 years on the plaintiff’s stated intent to work until age 65. Trial Tr.\n\nECF No. 71 at 13:13–:16. The defendant’s expert, Dr. Hurdle, based her estimate on tables from\n\na single economics journal article, published in 2006, that indicated the statistical average work\n\nlife for a woman of the plaintiff’s age was 27.37 years. Def.’s Ex. 37 at 8. Thus, a gap of over a\n\ndecade separates the experts’ assumption about the plaintiff’s work expectancy period and this\n\nhas a concomitant effect on the calculation of damages.\n\n       “The amount that the injured party would have earned but for the injury is not susceptible\n\nto precise measurement.” Nat’l R.R.

Thus, the focus in determining a plaintiff’s work\n\nexpectancy is on the particular plaintiff herself. “Statistics . . . are only one tool which may be\n\nused by an expert in forming an opinion.” 28 Weil v. Seltzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522848\"><a href=\"/opinion/522848/brian-keith-weil-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate-of-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1453</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1465 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n         Here, Dr. Lurito relied on the plaintiff’s express intent to work until the age of 65, which\n\nwas a very reasonable assumption for an expert to make given the plaintiff’s circumstances. The\n\nplaintiff is a single mother of two small children, with a high school education, and without an\n\nindependent source of wealth. See Trial Tr., ECF No. 55 at 74:17–:23; 75:1–11. It is entirely\n\nreasonable to believe that a woman in the plaintiff’s position would work (indeed, may find\n\nherself without a choice but to work) continuously until the age of 65. Moreover, the plaintiff’s\n\nwork ethic was on display during the trial, where she mentioned actively seeking a job even in\n\nher debilitated condition. See id. at 102:25; 103:1–9 (stating she had recently secured\n\nemployment with a cleaning company). It is also entirely common for courts in this district and\n\nthe local courts in the District of Columbia to credit an injured party’s intent to work until\n\nretirement age. See Buonocore v.

See Weil, 873 F.2d at 1464-65. The D.C. Circuit made clear that it was appropriate\nfor an expert to rely upon the “self-serving testimony” of the injured party “concerning the anticipated work-life\nexpectancy” so long as that expert was open to cross-examination. Id. at 1465.\n\n\n                                                             121\n\f1989) (“The court properly instructed the jury that [statistical] tables are only one factor (not\n\nconclusive) for it to consider in connection with other evidence of the claimant’s ‘health, habits,\n\nand activity’ in determining this claimant’s work-life expectancy.”).\n\n       Notably, while Dr. Hurdle cites statistics from one economics journal article to calculate\n\nthe plaintiff’s expected working life, she offers no reasons why the Court should accept those\n\nstatistics, why they are reliable, or why she chose those particular statistics or source. See Def.’s\n\nEx. 37 at 8 n.17 (citing Kurt Krueger et al., WORKLIFE IN A MARKOV MODEL WITH FULL-TIME\n\nAND PART-TIME ACTIVITY,      19 J. FORENSIC ECON. 80 (2006)). Set against the plaintiff’s\n\nstatement of intent and circumstances, as well as the caselaw that generally uses the retirement\n\nage of 65 in determining the work expectancy period, the Court finds that the assumption of the\n\nplaintiff’s expert, Dr. Lurito, that the plaintiff would have worked until age 65 to be firmly\n\ngrounded in the record and imminently reasonable.\n\n                                              *       *       *\n\n       In sum, the Court rejects as legally suspect or unreliable the key assumptions underlying\n\nthe defendant expert’s calculation of lost wages in favor of the plaintiff’s expert’s method for\n\ncomputing this aspect of the damages award. Therefore, the Court awards the plaintiff $737,715\n\nfor future lost wages.\n\n               4.        Loss of Household Services\n\n       Both parties concede that the loss of household services, which are described by the\n\nplaintiff’s expert as “the value of the services . . . Miss Rhodes would have provided to the\n\nchildren absent what’s happened to her,” are appropriate in this case. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 71\n\nat 20:22–25; Def.’s Ex. 37 at 12–13. The plaintiff’s expert estimates the loss of household\n\nservices to range from $508,121 to $652,939, Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 5, while the defendant’s expert\n\n\n\n\n                                                     122\n\festimates the loss to range from $164,729 to $347,628, depending on the method the defendant’s\n\nexpert used to calculate the loss. See Def.’s Ex. 37 at 15. Both parties calculate the loss of\n\nhousehold services to when the plaintiff’s youngest child reaches either the age of 18 or 21, well\n\npast the plaintiff’s estimated life expectancy. See Pl.’s Ex. 54 at 3; Def.’s Ex. 37 at 12–15.\n\n       The value of household services awarded in a personal injury case is to compensate the\n\ninjured party for her inability to do all of the things she was once able to do. See Lariscy v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">655</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1058 (D.D.C. 1987). The plaintiff’s children are not parties to\n\nthis action and therefore the computation of the loss of household services do not inure to their\n\nbenefit but must be limited to the anticipated lifespan of the plaintiff. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 71\n\nat 20:22–25.\n\n       Here, there is no doubt the plaintiff is unable to do everything she was once able to do in\n\ntaking care of her children and her household. See, e.g., Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 14:7–:8 (“[The\n\nplaintiff] doesn’t have the energy or the wherewithal to do it because she is in pain.”). Nurse\n\nPatterson also testified that there will come a time when, as a result of her Stage IV cancer, the\n\nplaintiff will be virtually unable to function at home and will need hospice care, quite possibly\n\nnecessitating a move into an assisted care facility. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 96:12–:24.\n\n       Both economics experts based their loss of household services estimates on the\n\nassumption that the plaintiff would be unable to provide for herself or her children as of January\n\n1, 2014, and that her life expectancy does not extend beyond October, 2014. See Pl.’s Ex. 54, at\n\n3–4; Def.’s Ex. 37, at 3, 12. Thus, the value of the household services the plaintiff will not be\n\nable to provide for during that ten month period must be determined. Once again, the parties’\n\nexperts differ as to how they calculate the value of lost household services.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    123\n\f       Dr. Lurito, the plaintiff’s expert, derived his valuation by determining the replacement\n\ncost, or what it would cost to hire a live-in nanny to provide the “household/parental services”\n\nthe plaintiff will no longer be able to provide due to her illness. Pl.’s Ex. 54, at 3. He estimated\n\nthat “the cost for a live-in homemaker to care for the children is at least $124 per day in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia area.” Id.\n\n       Dr. Hurdle, the defendant’s expert, offered two different estimates to account for the loss\n\nof household services. First, Dr. Hurdle accepted the plaintiff’s expert’s estimate for the cost of\n\na live-in nanny ($124 per day) and reduced the cost using an 8.98 percent discount rate to\n\naccount for the “risks associated with the need for a homemaker. For example, Ms. Rhodes\n\nherself may be able to provide these services for longer than assumed . . . or a relative other than\n\na live-in homemaker may choose to care for the children.” Def.’s Ex. 37, at 12. She also offered\n\nan alternative methodology where she used economic statistics tables to estimate the “average\n\nhourly value of household production in the District of Columbia.” Id. at 13 (citing Expectancy\n\nData, THE DOLLAR VALUE OF A DAY: 2010 DOLLAR VALUATION (2011)). The tables are\n\napparently based on a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor\n\nStatistics to determine “the number of hours that the average person spends performing\n\nhousehold services and the average wage that a person performing those services would earn.”\n\nId. This statistic does not appear to take account of the level of supervision required for small\n\nchildren, which is the actual circumstance of the plaintiff’s situation. Once again, Dr. Hurdle’s\n\ntheory is not grounded in the reality the plaintiff will experience.\n\n       Even if, as Dr. Hurdle suggests, the plaintiff is able to provide some household services\n\nin 2014, Def.’s Ex. 37, at 12, the plaintiff’s young children will require constant supervision and\n\nthe plaintiff’s home will require housekeeping when the plaintiff becomes incapacitated. It is\n\n\n\n\n                                                     124\n\freasonable to assume, in estimating the cost to the plaintiff for the loss of household services,\n\nthat she will have to pay market rates for a child care professional and/or a housekeeper to keep\n\nher household running. Dr. Lurito’s estimate uses such a market rate in determining the costs the\n\nplaintiff will incur. Therefore, the Court finds the plaintiff’s expert’s daily cost estimate to be\n\nwell-grounded in the record and particularized to the plaintiff’s circumstances.\n\n         The plaintiff’s expert estimates it will cost approximately $124 per day to compensate the\n\nplaintiff for her loss of household services. Pl.’s Ex. 54, at 3. The plaintiff is expected to be\n\nunable to provide household services beginning on January 1, 2014, which would represent a ten\n\nmonth gap before the end of her life expectancy during which she will need to pay for such\n\nservices. See Pl.’s Ex. 54, at 3–4; Def.’s Ex. 37, at 3, 12. At $124 per day for 304 days (the\n\nnumber of days in the year ending October 31), the Court finds $37,696 to be an appropriate\n\naward for the plaintiff’s loss of household services. 29\n\n                  5.       Pain and Suffering\n\n         Finally, the plaintiff requests a non-economic damages award of $6 million for her pain\n\nand suffering. Pl.’s. Concls. at 47. The defendant has failed to address the issue of non-\n\neconomic damages at all in its proposed conclusions of law. See generally Def.’s Concls. Thus,\n\nthe Court is left with virtually no response to the plaintiff’s request in determining the\n\n“notoriously difficult” matter of “determining an appropriate figure for intangible losses such as\n\nemotional suffering.” Bodoff v.

Apr. 15, 2013). In Fletcher, the plaintiff’s survival rate\n\ndropped from an 87.4 percent 10-year survival rate to zero. Id. at *11. The court awarded the\n\nplaintiff $3.25 million in non-economic pain and suffering damages. Id. at *10. The plaintiff in\n\nFletcher, like the plaintiff here, lost her breast and experienced “pain, suffering, loss of\n\n\n\n\n                                                     126\n\fenjoyment of life, anxiety, and fear of dying.” Id. at *10. Both the Fletcher plaintiff and the\n\nplaintiff in this case saw their breast cancer prognosis drop from likely survival to imminent\n\ndeath as a result of their physicians failing to follow the national standard of care and\n\nappropriately diagnose their breast cancer. See id. at *7-8. Both women now face cancers that\n\nhave metastasized into their bones, leading to great pain and suffering. Id. at 9. The Court finds\n\nthe facts in Fletcher remarkably similar to the facts here and therefore views it as a useful\n\nbenchmark.\n\n       A prerequisite for a pain and suffering damage award under District of Columbia law is\n\nthat the victim’s suffering must be “conscious” in order to be compensable. See Doe, 492 A.2d\n\nat 861. Juries in the District of Columbia are further instructed, when considering a damages\n\naward, that they may consider: (1) the extent and duration of any physical injuries sustained by\n\nthe plaintiff; (2) the effects that any physical injuries have on the overall physical and emotional\n\nwell-being of the plaintiff; (3) any physical pain and emotional distress that the plaintiff has\n\nsuffered in the past; (4) any physical pain and emotional distress that the plaintiff may suffer in\n\nthe future; (5) any disfigurement or deformity suffered by the plaintiff, as well as any humiliation\n\nor embarrassment associated with the disfigurement or deformity; (6) any inconvenience the\n\nplaintiff has experienced; and (7) any inconvenience the plaintiff may experience in the future.\n\nD.C.

Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 34:4–:5. Thus, the\n\n“extent and duration” of her injuries is continuous and will be so until her death. As for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    127\n\feffect her injuries “have on the overall physical and emotional well-being of the plaintiff” and\n\nemotional distress, the plaintiff experiences sadness and deep and constant feelings of guilt about\n\nthe way her impending death will affect her children. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 107:6–:9;\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 12:12–:15. She also fears death and the prospect of being unable to take\n\ncare of herself. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 14:2–:4 (“Her fear of death is probably just as strong\n\nas her fear of living . . . with pain and suffering and not able to function at all and play with her\n\nchildren.”). The District of Columbia also instructs jurors to consider “disfigurement or\n\ndeformity” and, here, the plaintiff has suffered through the loss of her breast and her hair due to\n\nher mastectomy and the effects of her chemotherapy. Id. at 9:19–:21; 31:22–:23; Trial Tr. ECF\n\nNo. 55 at 105:19–:22. Finally, regarding past and future inconvenience, the plaintiff is conscious\n\nevery day of her life that she will die soon, leaving her young children without a mother. See\n\nTrial Tr. ECF No. 55 at 107:6–:9. Furthermore, at some point in the future, efforts at treating her\n\nsymptoms will fail and her pain will continue to grow worse. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 34:10–\n\n:20 (noting “at some point in the future . . . no treatment will be available” to the plaintiff and\n\nhospice care will be necessary).\n\n       Any determination of a non-economic damages award is, by necessity, fact-intensive and\n\ntailored to the specific circumstances of the plaintiff. As in the determination of past care costs,\n\nhowever, it is necessary to determine to what extent the plaintiff’s non-economic damages are\n\ncaused by the progression of her cancer to Stage IV and are segregable from damages she would\n\nhave suffered had her cancer been properly diagnosed and treated at Stage I. See III.D.1 supra.\n\nThe plaintiff does not allege, nor could she prove, that she would have endured no pain and\n\nsuffering if not for the defendant’s negligence. Indeed, as the plaintiff’s experts noted, the\n\nplaintiff most likely would have undergone a mastectomy and chemotherapy even had her cancer\n\n\n\n\n                                                     128\n\fbeen caught at Stage I. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 72:12–:20; 73:2–:10. Although her survival\n\nrate would have been nearly 100 percent, the plaintiff would always have lived in some fear that\n\nher cancer would return. See Trial Tr. ECF No. 56 at 77:14–:16. The Court is mindful in\n\nevaluating the plaintiff’s request for an award of $6 million that, even absent the defendant’s\n\nnegligence, she would have suffered some level of pain and suffering.\n\n        Nevertheless, the fact that the defendant’s negligence converted what was a likely\n\nsurvivable diagnosis to a certain death sentence has caused and will continue to cause pain and\n\nsuffering far beyond what the plaintiff would have endured had the defendant caught the\n\nplaintiff’s cancer when she first presented with symptoms. Again, the Court finds the Fletcher\n\ncourt’s award instructive, but notes that the plaintiff here has the added feelings of sadness and\n\nworries about leaving her children motherless and is more than a decade younger than the\n\nplaintiff in Fletcher and is therefore losing that much more of her life. Consequently, the Court\n\nfinds, upon consideration of the seven factors enumerated in the District of Columbia’s jury\n\ninstructions and the decisions in this and other Districts in similar FTCA cases, that an award of\n\n$3.5 million for non-economic damages is reasonably appropriate.\n\n                                          *       *         *\n\n        In total, the Court awards the following in economic and non-economic damages to the\n\nplaintiff:\n\n        -    $33,285.17 for the cost of past medical care;\n\n        -    $149,886 for the cost of future medical care;\n\n        -    $737,715 for future lost wages;\n\n        -    $37,696 for the loss of household services; and\n\n        -    $3,500,000 for pain and suffering.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      129\n\fThese costs total $4,458,582.17.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds Dr. Hill-Daniel breached the applicable\n\nnational standard of care in her treatment of the plaintiff as her primary care physician and this\n\nnegligence was the proximate cause of the progression of the plaintiff’s breast cancer from Stage\n\nI to incurable Stage IV. The Court further finds that the plaintiff has proven the costs she has\n\nalready incurred for medical expenses directly attributable to the defendant’s negligence and a\n\nreasonable estimate of the costs she will incur going forward. Therefore, the Court will enter\n\njudgment in favor of the plaintiff and award damages in the amount of $4,458,582.17.\n\n       A separate order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             Digitally signed by Beryl A.
