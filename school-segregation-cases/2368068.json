By agreement of both sides, the claims have been divided into five discrete groups for purposes of trial on the issue of liability. Trial has been completed on the liability issue with respect to the first group, consisting of five African American plaintiffs who assert they suffered racial discrimination in hiring. This order sets forth the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issue of liability regarding this first group of plaintiffs. I conclude that each of these five plaintiffs was the victim of intentional racial discrimination in hiring in violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Introduction</i></h2>\n<p>During the period at issue, Sunland was a residential facility for the profoundly retarded. The defendant State of Florida owned and operated the facility.<sup>[1]</sup> Residents lived in houses, sometimes referred to as \"cottages.\" Basic care for residents, including assistance with such necessities as eating, dressing, bathing and toilet functions, was provided by employees assigned to the various cottages; these caregiving employees were known as \"cottage parents.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The five plaintiffs now before the court applied many times during the period at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1238</span> issue for the job of \"cottage parent.\" The only stated qualifications for the job were a high school diploma or \"[e]xperience in rearing a family or in related custodial or nursing environments\"; such experience could be \"substituted on a year-for-year basis for the high school education requirement.\" The five plaintiffs all had high school diplomas as well as experience of this type, but they were passed over many times for the position of cottage parent. They also applied for but failed to obtain other jobs at Sunland for which they were qualified.</p>\n<p>When it opened, Sunland had separate houses for African Americans and whites, respectively. African Americans were substantially under-represented among Sunland employees. By 1976, the first year at issue in the case at bar, however, segregated housing had been eliminated, and African American hiring was on the upswing. Indeed, Sunland made substantial and commendable efforts to increase African American hiring throughout the 1976-1984 period.</p>\n<p>Still, African American applicants did not receive the same treatment as whites with respect to hiring for the positions at issue. African Americans, including these five plaintiffs, suffered intentional racial discrimination in hiring for these positions throughout this period. This is shown by (1) statistical evidence indicating that Sunland hired a substantially lower percentage of qualified African Americans for these positions than would have been expected if decisions had been made without intentional discrimination, (2) evidence of the goals and policies that Sunland administrators followed during this period intended to raise African American hiring but to do so to a level significantly below the level that would have been achieved by non-discriminatory hiring, and (3) evidence of the specific treatment of the plaintiffs as analyzed under the familiar burden-shifting framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). This order begins by recounting briefly the procedural history of this action, then summarizes the applicable legal principles, and then addresses in turn each of these three sources of proof.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Procedural Background</i></h2>\n<p>This litigation traces its origin to a class action complaint filed in this court on February 11, 1977, alleging a pattern of racial discrimination in initial hiring and promotions at Sunland in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. The first named plaintiff was Mary Worlds; the action became known as the <i>Worlds</i> case. The court initially certified a class but later decertified the class, effective as of June 1, 1985. The court notified former class members that they could seek to intervene by not later than July 31, 1985.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in the case at bar were members of the <i>Worlds</i> class but were not named plaintiffs in that case. When the class was decertified, they filed a timely motion to intervene in <i>Worlds.</i> By order dated April 24, 1987, the court denied the motion. Six days later, on April 30, 1987, plaintiffs filed the case at bar.</p>\n<p>The court in <i>Worlds</i> ultimately ruled that one plaintiff had been the subject of racial discrimination in hiring at Sunland but was entitled to no relief because he had made only token efforts to secure other, readily available employment over a period of some 13 years. The court ruled that the other <i>Worlds</i> plaintiffs had not been victims of racial discrimination. The <i>Worlds</i> plaintiffs appealed, and the state cross-appealed. The parties in the case at bar agreed that this action should be stayed pending resolution of the <i>Worlds</i> appeal.</p>\n<p>By order dated May 13, 1997, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed this court \"on all rulings.\" <i>Worlds v. Department of Health,</i> 116 F.3d 491 (11th Cir.1997) (unpublished opinion at 2). In due course, litigation of the case at bar resumed. Defenses arising from the requirement for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1239</span> the filing of administrative charges as a prerequisite to a Title VII action have been addressed by separate orders and remain pending. Subject to those defenses, this order resolves the issue of liability for the five plaintiffs whose cases have been tried.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Applicable Law</i></h2>\n<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination in employment based on race or other specified characteristics. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a)(1). If, as plaintiffs claim, the persons making hiring decisions at Sunland considered plaintiffs' race as an adverse factor in the employment process, then the state violated Title VII. This legal principle is beyond dispute and, indeed, is not disputed by the state in this case.</p>\n<p>It also is undisputed that plaintiffs who allege intentional discrimination in hiring may prove their cases in at least two ways: through direct evidence of discrimination (for example, testimony or other statements of the employer that race was a reason for the hiring decision at issue) or through the familiar burden-shifting framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), which focuses on the employer's hiring decision with respect to a specific position on a specific occasion. At least in class actions, plaintiffs also may prove their case in a third way: by proof that the employer has followed a pattern or practice of intentional discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co.,</i> 424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976). The parties disagree on whether the pattern or practice method of proof is also available in a case that, like the case at bar, is not a class action.</p>\n<p>It probably would be futile, and in any event it clearly is unnecessary in the case at bar, to attempt to set down an exhaustive list of, and definitive rules governing, the manner in which Title VII plaintiffs may prove their cases. The issue ultimately is whether, in making the employment decision at issue, the employer engaged in intentional discrimination based on a prohibited factor such as race. <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> sets forth a convention by which this issue may be addressed. But <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> does not create additional substantive elements of a Title VII case, over and above intentional discrimination, that a plaintiff must prove in order to prevail. Thus a plaintiff who proves intentional racial discrimination through admissible evidence is entitled to prevail without regard to whether he or she proves a \"prima facie case\" as defined in <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i><sup>[3]</sup> Such evidence may include proof of a pattern or practice, so long as the pattern or practice evidence, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1240</span> together with all the other evidence in the case, shows that the employer engaged in intentional racial discrimination with respect to the particular employment decision at issue.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In the case at bar, plaintiffs have produced no \"direct evidence\" of intentional racial discrimination in hiring during the period at issue. Plaintiffs have proceeded under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> and also have presented statistical and other evidence of a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in hiring. I find that there was a pattern and practice of racially discriminatory hiring for the positions at issue at Sunland during the period 1976-1984. I also conclude that plaintiffs have proven their entitlement to prevail under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> with respect to numerous individual positions. And even if, as the state asserts, plaintiffs properly could proceed only under <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i> plaintiffs' statistical and other evidence would remain admissible on the ultimate question of whether the hiring decisions at issue resulted from intentional racial discrimination. For the reasons that follow, I find that plaintiffs were victims of intentional racial discrimination in violation of Title VII and that, but for that discrimination, they would have been hired for specific positions they have identified.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Proof of Discrimination</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>STATISTICAL PROOF</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Courts long have recognized that statistical evidence may be relevant in assessing whether an employer has engaged in intentional discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States,</i> 433 U.S. 299, 307, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977). Such evidence is relevant in hiring cases because one would expect that, if an employer makes hiring decisions without regard to race, then given enough hiring decisions, the proportion of hires of a given race would approximate the proportion of qualified applicants of that race, other things being equal. <i>Id.; </i><i>International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 324, 339-40 n. 20, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). Some deviation between the percentage of hires and the percentage of qualified applicants, by race, of course would be expected, simply as a result of chance. But the odds that a deviation of a given magnitude would result solely as a matter of chance are also subject to calculation.</p>\n<p>The relevant statistical analysis starts, then, with (1) a compilation of the employer's actual hiring record by race for the type of position at issue during the time period at issue, and (2) a determination of the racial composition of the pool of qualified applicants to the employer for the type of position at issue during the time period at issue. The racial composition of the pool of qualified applicants is sometimes referred to as the \"benchmark,\" because it is the approximate result that race-neutral hiring would achieve, on average, given enough hiring decisions, and it therefore provides a reference or \"benchmark\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1241</span> to which the employer's actual hiring results can be compared.</p>\n<p>In the case at bar, the quality of available information on hiring for the positions at issue, by race, and on qualified applicants for the positions at issue, by race, is far from perfect. Both sides have submitted expert testimony compiling and interpreting statistical evidence derived from the imperfect available information. Not surprisingly, the parties and their experts disagree in various respects.</p>\n<p>The parties' principal disagreement is on the appropriate source that should be used to determine the benchmark. Plaintiffs' expert Dr. David W. Rasmussen has compiled data on actual applications to the Sunland facility for positions of the types and during the periods at issue. Defendants' expert, Dr. Paul H. White, asserts that the data on actual applications are too unreliable to be used, so he has used census data (that is, information on persons designated in the category of jobs at issue in the same geographic area) as a proxy for data on actual applications.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>I find Dr. Rasmussen's analysis credible. I conclude that the actual applicant flow data used by Dr. Rasmussen, while imperfect, are data of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field and thus provide a proper basis for his expert testimony. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 703; <i>see also </i><i>Bazemore v. Friday,</i> 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986) (recognizing that statistical evidence need not be perfect to have probative value and holding erroneous district court's failure to consider probative but imperfect statistical evidence). I find that these actual applicant flow data provide a far better benchmark against which to measure Sunland's hiring record than the census data used by Dr. White. I find that, under the circumstances of this particular case, the census data relied upon by Dr. White provide an unreliable benchmark.</p>\n<p>The positions most at issue with respect to the five plaintiffs whose cases have been tried include the position of cottage parent and other positions within the \"paraprofessional\" category denominated as category EEO 5. Dr. Rasmussen's analysis indicates that the appropriate benchmark for hiring of African Americans in category EEO 5 jobs at Sunland, calculated based on actual applications, was 50%. For the period 1977-1980, however, only 66 of 274 persons hired for such jobs at Sunland (or 24%) were African American. For the period 1981-1984, only 52 of 176 persons hired for such jobs at Sunland (or 29.5%) were African American. These statistics produce standard deviations for these periods of -8.58 and -5.43, respectively, which in turn indicate that, other things being equal, such a low percentage of African American hires would result by chance far less than one time in a thousand. The odds of such a low percentage of African American hires for the 1977-1980 period occurring by chance, and being followed by such a low percentage of African American hires for the 1981-1984 period again by chance, are long indeed.</p>\n<p>Dr. Rasmussen's analysis, including his use of a 50% benchmark, draw additional support from the apparently undisputed evidence of actual hiring at Sunland beginning in 1985. In 1985, Sunland hired 50 new employees in category EEO 5, of which 27 (or 54%) were African American. In 1986, Sunland hired 20 new EEO 5 employees, of which 11 (or 55%) were African American. In 1987, Sunland hired 33 new EEO 5 employees, of which 19 (or 57.6%) were African American. A reasonable inference is that the available pool of EEO 5 applicants at Sunland has approximated 50%, just as Dr. Rasmussen concluded, that from 1976-1984 the race of African American applicants was a negative factor in the hiring process, and that the discrimination ended in 1985.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1242</span> I do not find credible Dr. White's contrary analysis, which resulted in a 30.9% benchmark for African American hiring in category EEO 5 based on census data showing that, in the appropriately-weighted relevant geographic area, 30.9% of persons designated in category EEO 5 jobs were African American. First, as a matter of principle, actual applicant flow data (if available), not census data, provide the appropriate benchmark. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Payne v. Travenol Lab., Inc.,</i> 673 F.2d 798, 823-24 (5th Cir.1982) (recognizing that reliable applicant flow data rather than population data provide appropriate benchmark against which hiring record should be measured). This is because hiring decisions at Sunland were made from applicants for positions at Sunland, not from persons counted in the applicable job category in the census. If, as appears to have been the case, 50% of the qualified applicants for EEO 5 jobs at Sunland were African American while 30.9% of persons counted in the census in category EEO 5 in the geographic area were African American, one would expect Sunland to have hired roughly 50% African Americans for EEO 5 jobs at Sunland, not 30.9%, if indeed hiring at Sunland was done on a race-neutral basis. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Dr. White does not dispute this. He says, however, that Dr. Rasmussen's data are so unreliable they should not be used. Dr. White thus says there is no reliable evidence that in fact 50% of qualified applicants for EEO 5 positions at Sunland during the 1976-1984 period were African American. Dr. White says the best reliable data are the census data, showing that 30.9% of EEO 5 persons in the appropriately-weighted geographic area were African American. Dr. White thus says the appropriate benchmark is 30.9%.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Some of Dr. White's criticisms of Dr. Rasmussen's data are incorrect, and some deal with alleged errors so small that they would have no material effect on Dr. Rasmussen's ultimate conclusions. More fundamentally, Dr. White has identified no race-sensitive errors (that is, errors that would be expected to skew Dr. Rasmussen's results along racial lines), no errors that explain the striking increase in African American hiring for the years 1985-1987, no errors that explain the close correlation between Dr. Rasmussen's benchmark and actual hiring for the years 1985-1987, and no errors that explain the substantial divergence between Dr. White's benchmark and actual hiring for the years 1985-1987.</p>\n<p>This latter point is especially significant. Sunland's hiring record for 1985-1987 is much more consistent with Dr. Rasmussen's view that an appropriate benchmark for African American hiring in category EEO 5 at Sunland was 50% than with Dr. White's view based on census data that an appropriate benchmark was only 30.9%. Dr. White has offered no explanation for why, if his analysis is correct, the hiring rate for African Americans in category EEO 5 at Sunland consistently exceeded 50% for the years 1985-1987.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1243</span> In short, I find that Dr. Rasmussen's 50% benchmark is analytically sound, supported by imperfect but reasonably reliable data, and far more consistent with the undisputed evidence regarding actual hiring during the years 1985-1987 than Dr. White's proposed benchmark.</p>\n<p>That the 50% benchmark dramatically exceeds the 30.9% African American share of EEO 5 persons in the geographic area does not undermine these conclusions. A reasonable hypothesis is that African Americans applied for cottage parent positions at Sunland in numbers disproportionate to their representation in the census. This would not be surprising for at least two reasons. First, as this record confirms without dispute, African Americans faced a substantially higher unemployment rate in the relevant geographic area at the relevant time than whites. There were thus a higher percentage of African Americans looking for work than projected by Dr. White's analysis, which took no account of the relative unemployment rates by race. Second, the position of cottage parent is a demanding and sometimes unpleasant and even demeaning position that one reasonably would expect to attract a disproportionate share of applicants with historically lower expectations and fewer good alternatives; this in turn would include a disproportionate share of African Americans, who in Jackson and surrounding counties of Florida in 1976 and even in 1984 faced not only higher unemployment but also continuing racial discrimination, at least from some employers. Thus one would not reasonably expect the racial breakdown of applicants for the position of cottage parent at Sunland to mirror the census data used by Dr. White, and one would not reasonably be surprised if, as Dr. Rasmussen determined for the period 1976-1984 and as the actual hiring record suggested for the period 1985-1987, as many as 50% or more of the applicants for the position were African American.</p>\n<p>Finally, even Dr. White's own analysis suggests there was racial discrimination in hiring for EEO 5 positions at Sunland for the years 1976-1980. His report concludes that Sunland hired 211 persons in category EEO 5 during that period, only 50 of whom were African American. Using Dr. White's census-based benchmark of 30.9%, one would have expected Sunland to hire 65.2 African Americans, not 50. This produces a standard deviation of -2.187, which social scientists would regard as statistically significant; the odds of such a result occurring by chance, other things being equal, are roughly 3/100. This evidence standing alone is hardly overwhelming, but it does support the conclusion that Sunland's hiring in category EEO 5 was not race neutral.</p>\n<p>In sum, the statistical evidence indicates that Sunland's pattern and practice during the years 1976-1984 was to engage in intentional discrimination against African Americans who, like plaintiffs, applied for positions in category EEO 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>SUNLAND'S EXPRESSED GOALS</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Further support for this conclusion comes from the testimony of Sunland administrators concerning their hiring goals during the 1976-1984 period.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1244</span> As of 1976, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had been in effect for only 12 years and had been applicable to the states for only four years. The Constitution itself and other statutes had of course predated Title VII, but decisions recognizing their effect on state hiring were not of long standing. As of 1976, the workforce at Sunland still reflected the effects of earlier race-based hiring.</p>\n<p>Commendably, Sunland administrators and state officials in Tallahassee were engaged throughout the 1976-1984 period in a good faith effort to improve African American hiring. Unfortunately, they set as a goal bringing African American hiring up to a level that would match the African American population in the geographic area.<sup>[8]</sup> The result was that supervisors who received 50% African American applications were nonetheless under instructions to bring African American hiring up to a level of around 30%. Phrased differently, the message to hiring authorities was that they could discriminate against African American applicants, so long as the frequency of the discrimination was not too severe.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>The actual results obtained at Sunland are consistent with a finding that the announced goal had a discriminatory effect on hiring. Dr. White's benchmark, based on census data for employment category EEO 5, was not substantially different from Sunland's announced goal, based on population. Dr. White's analysis showed that Sunland's African American EEO 5 hiring for the period of 1976-1980 fell significantly (although not drastically) below his benchmark, while by the period 1981-1984, hiring approached his benchmark. A reasonable inference is that African American hiring improved from 1976 forward, reaching the announced goal for the period 1981-1984. The announced goal, however, fell substantially below what Title VII required: non-discriminatory hiring.</p>\n<p>In short, Sunland's administrators had the laudable goal of improving African American hiring. They chose a target employment rate, however, that fell far short of what would be produced by the non-discriminatory hiring the law required, because of a significant divergence between the African American share of the population in the geographic area and the African American share of applications for the positions here at issue. When the flawed target was implemented by hiring authorities, the result was discrimination against African Americans, albeit discrimination less severe than had been in place earlier, and less severe than undoubtedly still was in place among some other employers in Jackson and surrounding counties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS</i>\n</h2>\n<p>That there was employment discrimination at Sunland in the types of position at issue of course does not necessarily mean that the five plaintiffs now before the court were victims of that discrimination. Their specific circumstances may be analyzed under the burden-shifting framework set forth in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) and <i>Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 253-54, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p>Under that framework, the initial burden is on the plaintiff to establish a \"prima facie case.\" The Eleventh Circuit has defined <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1245</span> a prima facie case for this purpose as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[P]laintiffs may establish a prima facie violation by showing that they are members of a group protected by title VII, that they sought and were qualified for positions that [the defendant employer] was attempting to fill, that despite their qualifications they were rejected, and that after their rejection [the employer] either continued to attempt to fill the positions or in fact filled the positions with [persons outside plaintiff's protected class].</blockquote>\n<p><i>Walker v. Mortham,</i> 158 F.3d 1177, 1187 (11th Cir.1998) (bracketing in original in part), <i>quoting </i><i>Crawford v. Western Elec. Co.,</i> 614 F.2d 1300, 1315 (5th Cir.1980), <i>citing </i><i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p>If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to present evidence that it acted for a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. While this burden is \"exceedingly light,\" <i>Holifield v. Reno,</i> 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 (11th Cir.1997), it cannot be met solely by a defendant's presentation of legal argument or after-the-fact rationalizations; the defendant must present \"admissible evidence\" of the actual reason for the action at issue. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). So long as the articulated reason is not based on race or other prohibited characteristics, it need not be a reason that seems wise or logical; under Title VII, an employer lawfully may take action for any non-discriminatory reason, good or bad, fair or unfair, or for no reason at all. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Combs v. Plantation Patterns,</i> 106 F.3d 1519, 1543 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that employee cannot overcome employer's proffered reason \"merely by questioning the wisdom of the employer's reason\").</p>\n<p>If the defendant meets the requirement of presenting evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for its action, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish that defendant's proffered reason is pretextual and that the plaintiff has been the victim of discrimination. On this issue, the statistical and other evidence addressed in earlier sections of this order, as well as all other relevant evidence, may be considered.</p>\n<p>I find that each of the five plaintiffs now before the court has established a <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> prima facie case with respect to various positions; that the state has provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for some of the hiring decisions at issue but has failed to provide such reasons for many others; and that many of the proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons are clearly pretextual. I find that each plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination and that absent such discrimination each plaintiff would have been hired at Sunland during the period at issue. The reasons underlying these conclusions, with specific examples illustrating the reasoning, are set forth in the text below. An appendix to this order sets forth my conclusions with respect to each plaintiff and each specific position at issue.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Prima Facie Case</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff Gwenevere Long is African American. From July 1977 through some time in 1983, she submitted 15 to 20 applications per year to Sunland for positions including cottage parent, residential training <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1246</span> instructor, dietary worker, and laundry worker.<sup>[11]</sup> She was qualified for these positions.<sup>[12]</sup> She was never offered any job. Many of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[13]</sup> Ms. Long has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a prima facie case with respect to each such specifically identified position filled with a white person.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Queen Granberry is African American. She repeatedly applied for positions at Sunland from May 1969 (well before the beginning of the period at issue) through some time in 1980. Among the positions for which she applied were cottage parent, food service aide, residential training instructor, and beautician. She was qualified for these positions.<sup>[14]</sup> She was never offered any job. Many of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[15]</sup> Ms. Granberry has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a prima facie case with respect to each such specifically identified position filled with a white person.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Marinda Hayes is African American. She applied for positions at Sunland approximately eight or nine times per year from the early 1970s (well before the beginning of the period at issue) through some time in 1982. Among the positions for which she applied were cottage parent, food service aide, and cook. She was qualified for these positions.<sup>[16]</sup> She was never offered any job. At least some of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[17]</sup> Ms. Hayes has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1247</span> prima facie case with respect to the specifically identified positions filled with a white person.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Jennifer Pittman is African American. She applied for positions beginning in June 1977, left the geographic area and stopped applying later that year, returned and began applying again in March 1980. Among the positions for which she applied were cottage parent, food service aide, and custodian. She was qualified for these positions but was rejected many times.<sup>[18]</sup> Many of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[19]</sup> Ms. Pittman has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a prima facie case with respect to each such specifically identified position filled with a white person.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Erma Calhoun is African American. She constantly applied for positions at Sunland beginning in 1972 (well before the beginning of the period at issue) and continuing throughout the period at issue. Among the positions for which she applied were cottage parent, food service aide, nursing assistant, and laundry worker. She was qualified for these positions.<sup>[20]</sup> She was never offered any job. Many of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[21]</sup> Ms. Calhoun has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a prima facie case with respect to each such specifically identified position filled with a white person.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Alleged Non-Discriminatory Reasons</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Prior to trial, plaintiffs propounded to the state an interrogatory asking for Sunland's alleged legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for choosing the successful white applicant for every position at issue. The state responded with no specific reason for any decision. The state said that, if plaintiffs \"by competent substantial evidence can establish having applied for any other positions, then Defendants respond upon their best information and belief that the best qualified applicant was chosen.\" <i>See, e.g.</i> Pl.Ex. 71. Under the law of the circuit, such a general, conclusory assertion is not sufficient to meet the employer's burden of providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for a decision, in response to an employee's prima facie case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>IMPACT v. Firestone,</i> 893 F.2d 1189, 1194 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>For some positions, the state failed to proffer any legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for selecting a white applicant over the plaintiff, other than the conclusory interrogatory answer.<sup>[22]</sup> With respect to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1248</span> those positions, plaintiffs are entitled to prevail, based on their presentation of an unrebutted prima facie case.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>For other positions, the state presented evidence at trial over and above its interrogatory answer. I admitted the evidence so that the record would be complete, notwithstanding the unfairness of allowing the state to proceed in this manner. The state's failure to answer the interrogatory with a candid description of the position it intended to present at trial was inexcusable.</p>\n<p>In addition, in many instances the non-discriminatory reason offered by the state at trial was merely an after-the-fact rationalization conjured by a person who did not participate in the hiring decision and did not know the true basis of the decision to hire the white winner. An employer does not meet its burden by proffering such an after-the-fact hypothesis; the employer's burden is to present \"admissible evidence\" of the actual reason for the action at issue. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <i>Lee v. Russell County Bd. of Educ.,</i> 684 F.2d 769, 775 (11th Cir. 1982).<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>These procedural flaws in the state's presentation would justify rejecting the state's proffered explanations. The unavailability of better proof, however, is not solely the state's fault. In a case alleging racial discrimination in a major state institution and seeking equitable relief, the state ought not lightly be foreclosed from presenting its best case on the merits. I thus have considered on the merits the evidence presented by the state at trial regarding Sunland's reasons for the hiring decisions at issue. For the most part, those reasons (if supported by evidence that they were the true reasons) would constitute legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons sufficient to carry the state's intermediate <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, for most positions for which the state offered testimony at trial of a reason why the white winner was selected over the plaintiff, I proceed on the assumption that the state has successfully met its intermediate burden, thus placing on plaintiffs the burden of proving, by the greater weight of the evidence, that each proffered reason was pretextual and that intentional discrimination was a reason for the hiring decision at issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1249</span> C. <i>Pretext</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Some of the state's proffered reasons for hiring decisions were not pretextual. The record establishes that, for the most part, Sunland gave a very strong preference to current Sunland employees over applicants from outside. Sunland gave a substantial, although not necessarily dispositive, preference to veterans. Sunland often, although not always, gave a preference to male applicants for some cottage parent positions (in at least some male cottages) and to female applicants for some cottage parent positions (in at least some female cottages).<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>Beyond these objectively verifiable preferences, however, the state's proffered explanations do not fare as well. The after-the-fact explanations offered by the state's witnesses did not have the ring of truth; they were unpersuasive and often contradictory.</p>\n<p>For example, Sunland hired Jeanette Bruner over plaintiffs Gwenevere Long and Jennifer Pittman for cottage parent position 11986 on January 23, 1981. The state proffered explanations that, first, Ms. Bruner was 40 years old and thus more mature, and second, Ms. Bruner raised six children, which is important experience. I find these explanations pretextual. Plaintiff Marinda Hayes was also approximately 40 years old when she applied for various positions, but that never seemed to help her. Plaintiff Erma Calhoun raised five children, but that never seemed to help her. Factors that are cited only when they help whites, not African Americans, are often pretexts for racial discrimination; I find that to be the case with respect to the reasons given for selecting Ms. Bruner. In fact, Ms. Long was a temporary employee at Sunland at the time of the application and had experience at other nursing facilities; Ms. Pittman had been a temporary employee at Sunland and a teacher's aide at an elementary school; and Ms. Bruner was an Avon salesperson. If there was a legitimate race-neutral reason for hiring Ms. Bruner over Ms. Long and Ms. Pittman, this record does not reflect it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the state's proffered explanation for choosing William Pierce over Ms. Long and Ms. Pittman for cottage parent position 11946 on May 12, 1982, was that he had experience with Sunland clients and staff through his experience with the Washington County School Board. But as of the date of his application, Mr. Pierce had been a teacher's aide for only a month. His other work experience was less than a year shipping and receiving at a uniform company in Tennessee. Ms. Long had spent six months as a CETA employee at Sunland itself and had two years experience at a nearby nursing facility. Ms. Pittman had three months experience at Sunland itself and a year as a teacher's aide in an elementary school. If there was a legitimate race-neutral reason for hiring Mr. Pierce over Ms. Long and Ms. Pittman, this record does not reflect it.</p>\n<p>The state's proffered explanation for choosing Rhonda Reddoch over plaintiff Queen Granberry for cottage parent position 12054 filled October 26, 1979, was that Ms. Reddoch had two children and a high school diploma. Ms. Reddoch had not worked for seven years as of that time. Plaintiff Erma Calhoun had five children and a high school diploma but was never hired; the state did not attempt to explain why Ms. Reddoch's children and high school diploma netted her a job while Ms. Calhoun's similar credentials did not. In any event, Ms. Granberry, who lost out to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1250</span> Ms. Reddoch, also had a high school diploma, and, in addition, Ms. Granberry had cared for her grandmother and a deaf mute aunt for many years, had worked for a year as a teacher's aide and at Sunland as a temporary CETA employee, and had been continuously employed for eight years (a factor cited by the state as a positive factor for successful white applicants). If there was a legitimate raceneutral reason for hiring Ms. Reddoch over Ms. Granberry, this record does not reflect it.</p>\n<p>The state's proffered reason for choosing Mary Lou Elmore over Ms. Granberry for cottage parent position 12031 on February 15, 1980, was that Ms. Elmore was at that time a temporary worker at Sunland. From Ms. Elmore's application, however, it appears she did not even meet the minimum qualifications for the cottage parent position; she had neither a high school education nor enough experience to substitute year for year for the missing education, as required by the written job qualifications. In any event, Ms. Granberry was clearly better qualified than Ms. Elmore. I find the explanation for the hiring of Ms. Elmore pretextual.</p>\n<p>The state's proffered reason for hiring James Gesslein over plaintiff Marinda Hayes for cottage parent position 12005 was that he had 40 hours of junior college credit and had been an orderly at a nursing home. Mr. Gesslein's application reflected one semester of junior college and six months work at the nursing home.<sup>[27]</sup> Ms. Hayes had two years of college and almost 18 months as a part-time care giver. If there was a legitimate race-neutral reason for hiring Mr. Gesslein over Ms. Hayes, this record does not reflect it.</p>\n<p>The state's proffered reason for choosing Donald Perry over plaintiff Jennifer Pittman for service aide position 11630 on April 15, 1983, was that Mr. Perry had done a good job while working at Sunland on a prison release program. Mr. Perry had no high school diploma, had served time in prison for grand theft, and listed as work experience only two day laborer positions of less than a year combined. Ms. Pittman had a high school diploma, was at that time a current Sunland custodial employee (thus qualifying for the virtually dispositive preference for current employees), had additional prior experience at Sunland, and had additional experience as a teacher's aide. There is no evidence that Ms. Pittman had not done good work in her two Sunland positions. I find pretextual the assertion that Mr. Perry was hired because of his good work in the prison release program.</p>\n<p>Finally, the state's proffered reasons for choosing Linwood Daffin over plaintiffs Erma Calhoun and Queen Granberry for cottage parent position 11963 on November 16, 1979, included that this was a position in a male cottage, that Mr. Daffin had a bachelor's degree, that Mr. Daffin worked with other inmates as a chaplain while he was serving a two-year drug trafficking sentence, and that Mr. Daffin had changed jobs four times in three years, showing his willingness to work. But the state interviewed at least three women for the position (including Ms. Granberry), suggesting this was not a \"male position.\" Ms. Calhoun and Ms. Granberry both had experience in patient care facilities much more relevant than experience as a chaplain to fellow prisoners. Mr. Daffin's frequent job changes were hardly a positive factor.<sup>[28]</sup> And in any event, Ms. Calhoun <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1251</span> and Ms. Pittman also were willing to work (as confirmed by their own work histories and by their many applications to Sunland). Commendable as Sunland's willingness to offer employment to a convicted felon may have been, the state did not suggest this was a reason for preferring Mr. Daffin over applicants with no criminal record. I find pretextual the state's proffered reasons for selecting Mr. Daffin over Ms. Calhoun and Ms. Pittman.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Intentional Discrimination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>That plaintiffs have shown that some of the state's proffered explanations for hiring decisions were pretextual does not end the matter. A finding of pretext permits, but does not require, a finding that a plaintiff has been the victim of intentional discrimination.</p>\n<p>I find that each of these five plaintiffs was well qualified for the positions at issue. Each had a high school diploma and significant care-giving experience. Each was intelligent, poised and articulate when she testified at trial.</p>\n<p>I find that each plaintiff would have been hired if the hiring process had been conducted without racial discrimination. I find that each plaintiff was a victim of intentional racial discrimination in each instance for which she established a prima facie case and either (1) the state failed to present a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its decision or (2) the state's proffered reason was pretextual. Intentional racial discrimination is the only reasonable explanation for the clear pattern of hiring decisions at Sunland during the period 1976-1984. Had it not been for that discrimination, plaintiffs would have been hired for jobs that instead went to whites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>\n<p>The five plaintiffs now before the court were well qualified for positions for which they applied at Sunland during the 1976-1984 period. But for intentional racial discrimination, they would have been hired. Accordingly,</p>\n<p>IT IS ORDERED:</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs Gwenevere Long, Queen Granberry, Marinda Hayes, Jennifer Pittman and Erma Calhoun are hereby determined to be entitled to prevail on the issue of liability, subject to defenses relating to the filing of administrative charges. I do <i>not</i> direct the entry of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). By separate notice, the clerk shall set a scheduling conference, at which the scope, sequence and timing of further proceedings, including the desirability of further mediation, will be addressed. The attorneys shall confer with one another at least five days prior to the scheduling conference in a good faith effort to reach agreement on all such issues and shall be prepared to announce any agreements on such issues at the scheduling conference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX 1</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>GWENEVERE LONG</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Successful Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<blockquote>A.

For case of reference, this order refers to the defendants collectively as \"the state.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The job description labeled this \"routine work\" with duties including \"restraining overactive or disciplinary problem retardates, assisting retardates in personal hygiene activities, dispensing prescribed medications and performing general custodial work in the residential cottages.\" The job description included as examples of work performed training or assisting residents in personal hygiene activities, escorting them to and from the dining room or other facilities, feeding residents who could not feed themselves and assisting others, performing laundry and custodial duties, and observing residents for behavioral changes. (Pl.Ex.65.)</p>\n<p>[3]  The use of the terminology \"prima facie case\" in <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> is perhaps unfortunate. The term \"prima facie case\" is sometimes used in other contexts to mean the elements on which the plaintiff <i>must</i> present evidence in order to have the matter submitted to the finder of fact. In Title VII cases, however, a plaintiff need not proceed under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> at all; as is beyond dispute, a plaintiff may proceed based on \"direct evidence\" of intentional discrimination without prop of a <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> \"prima facie case.\" The better view is that a plaintiff also may proceed based on any other evidence from which a finder of fact reasonably could find intentional discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Wright v. Southland Corp.,</i> 187 F.3d 1287, 1292-93 (11th Cir.1999) (noting that a plaintiff may \"forego <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> and simply attempt to prove illegal discrimination `under the ordinary standards of proof'\"), <i>quoting </i><i>EEOC v. Clay Printing Co.,</i> 955 F.2d 936, 940 (4th Cir.1992); <i>Hill v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth.,</i> 841 F.2d 1533, 1540 (11th Cir.) (finding that plaintiffs \"are not required to adopt a <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> approach\" and may use proof of employer actions from which one may infer discriminatory motivation more likely than not), <i>modified,</i> 848 F.2d 1522 (11th Cir.1988). The contrary view would be inconsistent with the plain language of Title VII (which allows recovery for intentional discrimination), the Federal Rules of Evidence and particularly Rule 402 (which provide that relevant evidence generally is admissible and do not restrict proof to a particular method), and cases allowing other plaintiffs (either the government or class representatives) to use other methods of proof with respect to precisely the same substantive Title VII standard (that is, the same issue of intentional discrimination). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (recognizing pattern or practice proof in government action); <i>Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co.,</i> 424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976) (recognizing pattern or practice proof in private class action).</p>\n<p>[4]  Courts have held that, in class actions, a showing of a pattern or practice of discrimination shifts the burden to the employer to show that any individual class member was not a victim of discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co.,</i> 424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976). Under the law of the circuit, however, the same rule apparently does not apply in individual actions such as the case at bar. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Carter v. Three Springs Residential Treatment,</i> 132 F.3d 635, 642 n. 5 (11th Cir.1998) (asserting that statistics alone cannot carry plaintiff's burden of production in individual disparate treatment case); <i>Carmichael v. Birmingham Saw Works,</i> 738 F.2d 1126, 1131 (11th Cir. 1984) (requiring individual disparate treatment plaintiff to point to specific instance of discrimination in order to ascertain economic loss rather than rely exclusively on statistical evidence). Thus in an individual action, the initial burden of production and the ultimate burden of persuasion are on the plaintiff; and a pattern and practice showing, without more, apparently would not be sufficient to carry either burden.</p>\n<p>[5]  Dr. White relied in part on work done earlier by other professionals in his firm. For convenience, I refer to Dr. White to mean not only Dr. White personally but also the others whose work he presented at trial.</p>\n<p>[6]  Dr. White of course is correct that census data may appropriately be considered when reliable applicant flow data are unavailable. Census data also may be considered even when reliable applicant flow data are available. Whether census data are probative, and what they prove, depend on the factual circumstances of the particular case. I have considered the census data and Dr. White's analysis, together with all the evidence in this case, and make the findings and conclusions set forth in the text.</p>\n<p>[7]  Dr. White did assert that prior to 1985, there was a \"preference\" for applicants for the position of cottage parent who were high school graduates, and he suggested that the elimination of this preference in 1985 may have affected hiring by race. The evidence does not support that claim. During the period 1980-1984, the job description for cottage parent required a high school diploma but provided, \"Experience in rearing a family or in related custodial or nursing environments may be substituted on a year-for-year basis for the high school education requirement.\" (Def.Ex.61C.) No preference was given as between applicants with a high school diploma, on the one hand, and applicants with qualifying substitute experience, on the other. In any event, there is no evidence in this record regarding the relative high school graduation rates or substitute experience rates among applicants by race; there is thus no evidence that elimination of the high-school-or-substitute-experience requirement affected hiring by race. More importantly, beginning in 1985, there clearly was no high school requirement. Dr. White has offered no explanation for why Sunland hired more than 50% African Americans in category EEO 5 for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987, if indeed the appropriate benchmark for those years was 30.9%, as he asserts. That hiring in 1985-1987 was consistent with Dr. Rasmussen's benchmark, not with Dr. White's benchmark, had nothing to do with high school diplomas, which clearly were not required in those years. And finally, Dr. Rasmussen's analysis showing the appropriate benchmark as 50% for 1984 and earlier used state lists of <i>qualified</i> applicants, that is, applicants who met the requirement for high school or substitute experience. (The state says those lists were imperfect, and presumably they were, but there is no reason to believe there were material errors or errors skewed along racial lines.)</p>\n<p>[8]  This was the testimony of Melvin L. Herring and Joseph Kennedy. Nobody testified that Sunland's goal at the time was to have hiring mirror the racial distribution of qualified applicants (as one would expect, on average, from nondiscriminatory hiring). The state's affirmative action studies did show applicant flow data, but the testimony was that the actual goal at the facility was based on population.</p>\n<p>[9]  If applicants were 50% African American and 50% white but hiring authorities were told to hire 30% African Americans, then hiring authorities were free to hire whites more than twice as frequently as African Americans (70% compared to 30%), despite receiving equal numbers of applications. A system that gives whites more than twice the chance of being hired, other things being equal, is discriminatory.</p>\n<p>[10]  The positions listed in the appendices are culled from the following sources: (1) application documentation submitted by the parties, (2) plaintiffs' handwritten charts listing all positions applied for during the relevant time period, and (3) positions listed in the state's contemporaneous documentation (Forms 900) as having been applied for by plaintiffs. Findings with respect to the positions are derived from the testimony at trial and all exhibits. The appendices have been compiled without benefit of proposed findings of fact or other detailed submissions from the parties after trial. If any party asserts there are specific factual errors in the appendices or in this order, the party should raise the issue by motion for reconsideration, supported by specific citation to appropriate record sources.</p>\n<p>[11]  This was Ms. Long's uncontradicted testimony. Records no longer exist of all applications for these positions. Documentary evidence does, however, confirm some of Ms. Long's applications. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Pl.Ex. 20B, 20C &amp; 20G; Def.Ex. 65 E-1, E-2 &amp; E-6.</p>\n<p>[12]  Ms. Long received her high school diploma in 1976. Her work experience in the field of providing residential care included almost a year as a dietary aide at Marianna Convalescent Center, a nursing home; more than a year as a nurse's aide at Marianna Convalescent Center; a period beginning in December 1979 as a nurse's aide at Jackson County Convalescent Center; and six-month periods in 1973 and 1980 working in cottages at Sunland under the CETA program. As confirmation she met the minimum requirements of the jobs, Ms. Long was interviewed twice for the position of cottage parent and at least once for resident training instructor.</p>\n<p>[13]  This is a reasonable inference from the number of applications submitted and the percentage of whites hired for positions of this type. In addition, the record includes documentation that for many of the positions for which Ms. Long applied, the successful applicant was white. Examples include cottage parent position 12031 filled February 15, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 20B; Def.Ex. 65 E-1); cottage parent position 12017 filled September 26, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 20C; Def.Ex. 65 E-2); and cottage parent position 11986 filled January 23, 1981 (Pl.Ex. 20L; Def.Ex. 65 E-11).</p>\n<p>[14]  Ms. Granberry graduated from high school in 1967. She received a cosmetology certificate from a junior college in 1968 and maintained a cosmetology license. Her relevant experience included one year as a teacher's aide at a high school and a summer as a CETA worker at Sunland, in addition to caring for her grandmother for three years and for a deaf mute aunt for 15 years. These credentials easily met the qualifications for the positions noted in the text. Ms. Granberry also applied for secretary and clerk-typist positions but was not qualified because she did not have the required state typing certification.</p>\n<p>[15]  Examples include cottage parent position 11986 filled September 28, 1979 (Pl.Ex. 23G; Def.Ex. 65 F. -1); cottage parent position 12053 filled October 26, 1979 (Pl.Ex.23J); (Def.Ex. 65 F. -4); and cottage parent position 12036 filled May 9, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 23T; Def.Ex. 65 F-13).</p>\n<p>[16]  Ms. Hayes graduated from high school in 1961. Her relevant experience included caring for her 88-year-old grandmother, caring for her blind uncle, assisting in caring for her ten siblings, and working as a private caretaker for an individual. These credentials easily met the qualifications for the positions noted in the text. Ms. Hayes also applied for secretary and clerk-typist positions but was not qualified because she did not have the required state typing certification.</p>\n<p>[17]  Examples include cottage parent position 11904 filled on or about January 19, 1982 (Pl.Ex. 24A; Def.Ex. 65 G-1); and cottage parent position 12005 filled on or about January 19, 1982 (Def.Ex. 65 G-1).</p>\n<p>[18]  Ms. Pittman graduated from high school in 1977. Her relevant experience included three months as a CETA worker at Sunland. Ms. Pittman thus clearly was qualified for the position of cottage parent. In addition, she was offered and accepted positions at Sunland as custodian in October 1982 and food service aide in July 1983; she thus clearly was qualified for those positions. The record does not establish that she met the minimum qualifications for other positions for which she applied, including residential training instructor, security guard, trades helper, and nursing assistant.</p>\n<p>[19]  Examples include cottage parent position 11909 filled January 16, 1981 (Pl.Ex. 28C; Def.Ex. 65 H-1); cottage parent position 11986 filled January 23, 1981 (Pl.Ex. 28B; Def.Ex. 65 H-2); and cottage parent position 12020 filled on or about July 1981 (Pl.Ex. 28H; Def.Ex. 65 H-6).</p>\n<p>[20]  Ms. Calhoun graduated from high school in 1973. Her relevant experience included more than four years at Florida State Hospital, the state's public mental health in-patient facility, as a psychological aide and doing food service, housekeeping and custodial work. She also raised five children. These credentials easily met the qualifications for the positions noted in the text. Ms. Calhoun also applied for positions of resident training instructor, cook II, and human service worker, but the record does not establish that she was qualified for these positions.</p>\n<p>[21]  Examples include cottage parent position 12005 filled on or about February 19, 1982 (Pl.Ex. 26Y; Def.Ex. 65 I-22); cottage parent position 12055 filled on January 16, 1981 (Def.Ex. 65 I-17); and cottage parent position 11932 filled on February 19, 1982 (Pl.Ex. 36Z; Def.Ex. 65 I-21).</p>\n<p>[22]  Examples include cottage parent position 12031 filled February 15, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 20B; Def.Ex. 65 E-1) and cottage parent position 12014 filled October 17, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 20G).</p>\n<p>[23]  I credit the prima facie case presented by each plaintiff. I do not credit the state's conclusory assertion that the person hired for each such position was better qualified than the plaintiff. That conclusory assertion (1) is insufficient as a matter of law to carry the employer's burden under <i>McDonnell Douglas;</i> (2) has not been supported by admissible testimony of any person with knowledge of the hiring decisions; (3) is contrary to evidence that in many instances the white winner was not better qualified than unsuccessful African American applicants including plaintiffs; and (4) is not credible.</p>\n<p>[24]  <i>See also </i><i>McDonald v. United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 745 F.2d 1081, 1087 (7th Cir.1984) (stating that defendant's asserted legitimate non-discriminatory reason \"must be based on admissible evidence\"); <i>White v. Vathally,</i> 570 F.Supp. 1431 (D.Mass.1983) (Keeton, J.) (stating that in order to rebut prima facie case of discrimination in hiring, employer must raise a \"genuine issue of fact ... by introducing evidence setting forth the reason for\" the hiring decision at issue), <i>aff'd,</i> 732 F.2d 1037 (1st Cir.1984); <i>Halfond v. Legal Aid Soc'y,</i> 70 F.Supp.2d 155, 163 (E.D.N.Y.1998) (rejecting defendant's reliance on asserted reasons for adverse action in absence of evidence that those reasons were relied upon by actual decision makers); <i>O'Halpin v. Nassau County Police Dep't,</i> 670 F.Supp. 75, 79 (E.D.N.Y.1987) (rejecting defendant's reliance on testimony of counsel who had no personal knowledge of hiring decision at issue; in absence of testimony by decision maker that proffered reason was actual reason for decision, defendant failed to carry its intermediate burden under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i>).</p>\n<p>[25]  The proffered reasons included preference for hiring any current Sunland employee; preference for hiring veterans; preference for having males in at least some cottage parent positions in at least some male cottages and having females in at least some cottage parent positions in at least some female cottages; and various alleged comparative rankings of different types of experience or work history.</p>\n<p>[26]  The state's testimony on the gender preference was not a model of clarity, perhaps because the state was not sure such a gender preference was legal. I assume, for purposes of this case, that the state could properly prefer cottage parents of the same gender as residents for the performance of some of the cottage parents' duties (for example, assisting residents with bathing or toilet functions). In any event, plaintiffs' complaint in the case at bar alleges only racial discrimination, not gender discrimination. Thus, for purposes of this case, if the state applied any gender preference equally to whites and African Americans, the gender preference would not provide a basis for recovery.</p>\n<p>[27]  Mr. Gesslein's employment history also showed frequent job changes, presumably a negative factor.</p>\n<p>[28]  Indeed, the state cited on another occasion a successful white applicant's long tenure in a job as a positive factor, showing stability. The pattern of the state's explanations on this at trial was that long tenure of a successful white applicant was a positive factor, and frequent job changes by a successful white applicant was a positive factor. Even not having been employed at all for a long period was not a negative factor for a successful white applicant. But the plaintiffs' work records were never a positive factor, or at least not positive enough to overcome whatever work record the successful white applicant happened to have. The state's explanations were pretextual.</p>\n\n</div>",

By agreement of both sides, the claims have been divided into five discrete groups for purposes of trial on the issue of liability. Trial has been completed on the liability issue with respect to the first group, consisting of five African American plaintiffs who assert they suffered racial discrimination in hiring. This order sets forth the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issue of liability regarding this first group of plaintiffs. I conclude that each of these five plaintiffs was the victim of intentional racial discrimination in hiring in violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Introduction</i></h2>\n<p>During the period at issue, Sunland was a residential facility for the profoundly retarded. The defendant State of Florida owned and operated the facility.<sup>[1]</sup> Residents lived in houses, sometimes referred to as \"cottages.\" Basic care for residents, including assistance with such necessities as eating, dressing, bathing and toilet functions, was provided by employees assigned to the various cottages; these caregiving employees were known as \"cottage parents.\"<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The five plaintiffs now before the court applied many times during the period at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1238</span> issue for the job of \"cottage parent.\" The only stated qualifications for the job were a high school diploma or \"[e]xperience in rearing a family or in related custodial or nursing environments\"; such experience could be \"substituted on a year-for-year basis for the high school education requirement.\" The five plaintiffs all had high school diplomas as well as experience of this type, but they were passed over many times for the position of cottage parent. They also applied for but failed to obtain other jobs at Sunland for which they were qualified.</p>\n<p>When it opened, Sunland had separate houses for African Americans and whites, respectively. African Americans were substantially under-represented among Sunland employees. By 1976, the first year at issue in the case at bar, however, segregated housing had been eliminated, and African American hiring was on the upswing. Indeed, Sunland made substantial and commendable efforts to increase African American hiring throughout the 1976-1984 period.</p>\n<p>Still, African American applicants did not receive the same treatment as whites with respect to hiring for the positions at issue. African Americans, including these five plaintiffs, suffered intentional racial discrimination in hiring for these positions throughout this period. This is shown by (1) statistical evidence indicating that Sunland hired a substantially lower percentage of qualified African Americans for these positions than would have been expected if decisions had been made without intentional discrimination, (2) evidence of the goals and policies that Sunland administrators followed during this period intended to raise African American hiring but to do so to a level significantly below the level that would have been achieved by non-discriminatory hiring, and (3) evidence of the specific treatment of the plaintiffs as analyzed under the familiar burden-shifting framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802-04, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973). This order begins by recounting briefly the procedural history of this action, then summarizes the applicable legal principles, and then addresses in turn each of these three sources of proof.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Procedural Background</i></h2>\n<p>This litigation traces its origin to a class action complaint filed in this court on February 11, 1977, alleging a pattern of racial discrimination in initial hiring and promotions at Sunland in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. The first named plaintiff was Mary Worlds; the action became known as the <i>Worlds</i> case. The court initially certified a class but later decertified the class, effective as of June 1, 1985. The court notified former class members that they could seek to intervene by not later than July 31, 1985.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in the case at bar were members of the <i>Worlds</i> class but were not named plaintiffs in that case. When the class was decertified, they filed a timely motion to intervene in <i>Worlds.</i> By order dated April 24, 1987, the court denied the motion. Six days later, on April 30, 1987, plaintiffs filed the case at bar.</p>\n<p>The court in <i>Worlds</i> ultimately ruled that one plaintiff had been the subject of racial discrimination in hiring at Sunland but was entitled to no relief because he had made only token efforts to secure other, readily available employment over a period of some 13 years. The court ruled that the other <i>Worlds</i> plaintiffs had not been victims of racial discrimination. The <i>Worlds</i> plaintiffs appealed, and the state cross-appealed. The parties in the case at bar agreed that this action should be stayed pending resolution of the <i>Worlds</i> appeal.</p>\n<p>By order dated May 13, 1997, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed this court \"on all rulings.\" <i>Worlds v. Department of Health,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742534\"><a href=\"/opinion/742534/worlds-v-department-of-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1997) (unpublished opinion at 2). In due course, litigation of the case at bar resumed. Defenses arising from the requirement for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1239</span> the filing of administrative charges as a prerequisite to a Title VII action have been addressed by separate orders and remain pending. Subject to those defenses, this order resolves the issue of liability for the five plaintiffs whose cases have been tried.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Applicable Law</i></h2>\n<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination in employment based on race or other specified characteristics. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a)(1). If, as plaintiffs claim, the persons making hiring decisions at Sunland considered plaintiffs' race as an adverse factor in the employment process, then the state violated Title VII. This legal principle is beyond dispute and, indeed, is not disputed by the state in this case.</p>\n<p>It also is undisputed that plaintiffs who allege intentional discrimination in hiring may prove their cases in at least two ways: through direct evidence of discrimination (for example, testimony or other statements of the employer that race was a reason for the hiring decision at issue) or through the familiar burden-shifting framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802-04, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973), which focuses on the employer's hiring decision with respect to a specific position on a specific occasion. At least in class actions, plaintiffs also may prove their case in a third way: by proof that the employer has followed a pattern or practice of intentional discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109404\"><a href=\"/opinion/109404/franks-v-bowman-transp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109404\"><a href=\"/opinion/109404/franks-v-bowman-transp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1251</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109404\"><a href=\"/opinion/109404/franks-v-bowman-transp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span> (1976). The parties disagree on whether the pattern or practice method of proof is also available in a case that, like the case at bar, is not a class action.</p>\n<p>It probably would be futile, and in any event it clearly is unnecessary in the case at bar, to attempt to set down an exhaustive list of, and definitive rules governing, the manner in which Title VII plaintiffs may prove their cases. The issue ultimately is whether, in making the employment decision at issue, the employer engaged in intentional discrimination based on a prohibited factor such as race. <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> sets forth a convention by which this issue may be addressed. But <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> does not create additional substantive elements of a Title VII case, over and above intentional discrimination, that a plaintiff must prove in order to prevail. Thus a plaintiff who proves intentional racial discrimination through admissible evidence is entitled to prevail without regard to whether he or she proves a \"prima facie case\" as defined in <i>McDonnell Douglas.</i><sup>[3]</sup> Such evidence may include proof of a pattern or practice, so long as the pattern or practice evidence, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1240</span> together with all the other evidence in the case, shows that the employer engaged in intentional racial discrimination with respect to the particular employment decision at issue.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In the case at bar, plaintiffs have produced no \"direct evidence\" of intentional racial discrimination in hiring during the period at issue. Plaintiffs have proceeded under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> and also have presented statistical and other evidence of a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in hiring. I find that there was a pattern and practice of racially discriminatory hiring for the positions at issue at Sunland during the period 1976-1984. I also conclude that plaintiffs have proven their entitlement to prevail under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> with respect to numerous individual positions. And even if, as the state asserts, plaintiffs properly could proceed only under <i>McDonnell Douglas,</i> plaintiffs' statistical and other evidence would remain admissible on the ultimate question of whether the hiring decisions at issue resulted from intentional racial discrimination. For the reasons that follow, I find that plaintiffs were victims of intentional racial discrimination in violation of Title VII and that, but for that discrimination, they would have been hired for specific positions they have identified.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Proof of Discrimination</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>STATISTICAL PROOF</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Courts long have recognized that statistical evidence may be relevant in assessing whether an employer has engaged in intentional discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109724\"><a href=\"/opinion/109724/hazelwood-school-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 307, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109724\"><a href=\"/opinion/109724/hazelwood-school-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2736</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109724\"><a href=\"/opinion/109724/hazelwood-school-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span> (1977). Such evidence is relevant in hiring cases because one would expect that, if an employer makes hiring decisions without regard to race, then given enough hiring decisions, the proportion of hires of a given race would approximate the proportion of qualified applicants of that race, other things being equal. <i>Id.; </i><i>International Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, 339-40 n. 20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1843</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (1977). Some deviation between the percentage of hires and the percentage of qualified applicants, by race, of course would be expected, simply as a result of chance. But the odds that a deviation of a given magnitude would result solely as a matter of chance are also subject to calculation.</p>\n<p>The relevant statistical analysis starts, then, with (1) a compilation of the employer's actual hiring record by race for the type of position at issue during the time period at issue, and (2) a determination of the racial composition of the pool of qualified applicants to the employer for the type of position at issue during the time period at issue. The racial composition of the pool of qualified applicants is sometimes referred to as the \"benchmark,\" because it is the approximate result that race-neutral hiring would achieve, on average, given enough hiring decisions, and it therefore provides a reference or \"benchmark\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1241</span> to which the employer's actual hiring results can be compared.</p>\n<p>In the case at bar, the quality of available information on hiring for the positions at issue, by race, and on qualified applicants for the positions at issue, by race, is far from perfect. Both sides have submitted expert testimony compiling and interpreting statistical evidence derived from the imperfect available information. Not surprisingly, the parties and their experts disagree in various respects.</p>\n<p>The parties' principal disagreement is on the appropriate source that should be used to determine the benchmark. Plaintiffs' expert Dr. David W. Rasmussen has compiled data on actual applications to the Sunland facility for positions of the types and during the periods at issue. Defendants' expert, Dr. Paul H. White, asserts that the data on actual applications are too unreliable to be used, so he has used census data (that is, information on persons designated in the category of jobs at issue in the same geographic area) as a proxy for data on actual applications.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>I find Dr. Rasmussen's analysis credible. I conclude that the actual applicant flow data used by Dr. Rasmussen, while imperfect, are data of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field and thus provide a proper basis for his expert testimony. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 703; <i>see also </i><i>Bazemore v. Friday,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111746\"><a href=\"/opinion/111746/bazemore-v-friday/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111746\"><a href=\"/opinion/111746/bazemore-v-friday/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I find that these actual applicant flow data provide a far better benchmark against which to measure Sunland's hiring record than the census data used by Dr. White. I find that, under the circumstances of this particular case, the census data relied upon by Dr. White provide an unreliable benchmark.</p>\n<p>The positions most at issue with respect to the five plaintiffs whose cases have been tried include the position of cottage parent and other positions within the \"paraprofessional\" category denominated as category EEO 5. Dr. Rasmussen's analysis indicates that the appropriate benchmark for hiring of African Americans in category EEO 5 jobs at Sunland, calculated based on actual applications, was 50%. For the period 1977-1980, however, only 66 of 274 persons hired for such jobs at Sunland (or 24%) were African American. For the period 1981-1984, only 52 of 176 persons hired for such jobs at Sunland (or 29.5%) were African American. These statistics produce standard deviations for these periods of -8.58 and -5.43, respectively, which in turn indicate that, other things being equal, such a low percentage of African American hires would result by chance far less than one time in a thousand. The odds of such a low percentage of African American hires for the 1977-1980 period occurring by chance, and being followed by such a low percentage of African American hires for the 1981-1984 period again by chance, are long indeed.</p>\n<p>Dr. Rasmussen's analysis, including his use of a 50% benchmark, draw additional support from the apparently undisputed evidence of actual hiring at Sunland beginning in 1985. In 1985, Sunland hired 50 new employees in category EEO 5, of which 27 (or 54%) were African American. In 1986, Sunland hired 20 new EEO 5 employees, of which 11 (or 55%) were African American. In 1987, Sunland hired 33 new EEO 5 employees, of which 19 (or 57.6%) were African American. A reasonable inference is that the available pool of EEO 5 applicants at Sunland has approximated 50%, just as Dr. Rasmussen concluded, that from 1976-1984 the race of African American applicants was a negative factor in the hiring process, and that the discrimination ended in 1985.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1242</span> I do not find credible Dr. White's contrary analysis, which resulted in a 30.9% benchmark for African American hiring in category EEO 5 based on census data showing that, in the appropriately-weighted relevant geographic area, 30.9% of persons designated in category EEO 5 jobs were African American. First, as a matter of principle, actual applicant flow data (if available), not census data, provide the appropriate benchmark. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Payne v. Travenol Lab., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"401048\"><a href=\"/opinion/401048/28-fair-emplpraccas-1212-28-empl-prac-dec-p-32647-willie-mae-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span>, 823-24 (5th Cir.1982) (recognizing that reliable applicant flow data rather than population data provide appropriate benchmark against which hiring record should be measured). This is because hiring decisions at Sunland were made from applicants for positions at Sunland, not from persons counted in the applicable job category in the census. If, as appears to have been the case, 50% of the qualified applicants for EEO 5 jobs at Sunland were African American while 30.9% of persons counted in the census in category EEO 5 in the geographic area were African American, one would expect Sunland to have hired roughly 50% African Americans for EEO 5 jobs at Sunland, not 30.9%, if indeed hiring at Sunland was done on a race-neutral basis. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Dr. White does not dispute this. He says, however, that Dr. Rasmussen's data are so unreliable they should not be used. Dr. White thus says there is no reliable evidence that in fact 50% of qualified applicants for EEO 5 positions at Sunland during the 1976-1984 period were African American. Dr. White says the best reliable data are the census data, showing that 30.9% of EEO 5 persons in the appropriately-weighted geographic area were African American. Dr. White thus says the appropriate benchmark is 30.9%.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Some of Dr. White's criticisms of Dr. Rasmussen's data are incorrect, and some deal with alleged errors so small that they would have no material effect on Dr. Rasmussen's ultimate conclusions. More fundamentally, Dr. White has identified no race-sensitive errors (that is, errors that would be expected to skew Dr. Rasmussen's results along racial lines), no errors that explain the striking increase in African American hiring for the years 1985-1987, no errors that explain the close correlation between Dr. Rasmussen's benchmark and actual hiring for the years 1985-1987, and no errors that explain the substantial divergence between Dr. White's benchmark and actual hiring for the years 1985-1987.</p>\n<p>This latter point is especially significant. Sunland's hiring record for 1985-1987 is much more consistent with Dr. Rasmussen's view that an appropriate benchmark for African American hiring in category EEO 5 at Sunland was 50% than with Dr. White's view based on census data that an appropriate benchmark was only 30.9%. Dr. White has offered no explanation for why, if his analysis is correct, the hiring rate for African Americans in category EEO 5 at Sunland consistently exceeded 50% for the years 1985-1987.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1243</span> In short, I find that Dr. Rasmussen's 50% benchmark is analytically sound, supported by imperfect but reasonably reliable data, and far more consistent with the undisputed evidence regarding actual hiring during the years 1985-1987 than Dr. White's proposed benchmark.</p>\n<p>That the 50% benchmark dramatically exceeds the 30.9% African American share of EEO 5 persons in the geographic area does not undermine these conclusions. A reasonable hypothesis is that African Americans applied for cottage parent positions at Sunland in numbers disproportionate to their representation in the census. This would not be surprising for at least two reasons. First, as this record confirms without dispute, African Americans faced a substantially higher unemployment rate in the relevant geographic area at the relevant time than whites. There were thus a higher percentage of African Americans looking for work than projected by Dr. White's analysis, which took no account of the relative unemployment rates by race. Second, the position of cottage parent is a demanding and sometimes unpleasant and even demeaning position that one reasonably would expect to attract a disproportionate share of applicants with historically lower expectations and fewer good alternatives; this in turn would include a disproportionate share of African Americans, who in Jackson and surrounding counties of Florida in 1976 and even in 1984 faced not only higher unemployment but also continuing racial discrimination, at least from some employers. Thus one would not reasonably expect the racial breakdown of applicants for the position of cottage parent at Sunland to mirror the census data used by Dr. White, and one would not reasonably be surprised if, as Dr. Rasmussen determined for the period 1976-1984 and as the actual hiring record suggested for the period 1985-1987, as many as 50% or more of the applicants for the position were African American.</p>\n<p>Finally, even Dr. White's own analysis suggests there was racial discrimination in hiring for EEO 5 positions at Sunland for the years 1976-1980. His report concludes that Sunland hired 211 persons in category EEO 5 during that period, only 50 of whom were African American. Using Dr. White's census-based benchmark of 30.9%, one would have expected Sunland to hire 65.2 African Americans, not 50. This produces a standard deviation of -2.187, which social scientists would regard as statistically significant; the odds of such a result occurring by chance, other things being equal, are roughly 3/100. This evidence standing alone is hardly overwhelming, but it does support the conclusion that Sunland's hiring in category EEO 5 was not race neutral.</p>\n<p>In sum, the statistical evidence indicates that Sunland's pattern and practice during the years 1976-1984 was to engage in intentional discrimination against African Americans who, like plaintiffs, applied for positions in category EEO 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>SUNLAND'S EXPRESSED GOALS</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Further support for this conclusion comes from the testimony of Sunland administrators concerning their hiring goals during the 1976-1984 period.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1244</span> As of 1976, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had been in effect for only 12 years and had been applicable to the states for only four years. The Constitution itself and other statutes had of course predated Title VII, but decisions recognizing their effect on state hiring were not of long standing. As of 1976, the workforce at Sunland still reflected the effects of earlier race-based hiring.</p>\n<p>Commendably, Sunland administrators and state officials in Tallahassee were engaged throughout the 1976-1984 period in a good faith effort to improve African American hiring. Unfortunately, they set as a goal bringing African American hiring up to a level that would match the African American population in the geographic area.<sup>[8]</sup> The result was that supervisors who received 50% African American applications were nonetheless under instructions to bring African American hiring up to a level of around 30%. Phrased differently, the message to hiring authorities was that they could discriminate against African American applicants, so long as the frequency of the discrimination was not too severe.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>The actual results obtained at Sunland are consistent with a finding that the announced goal had a discriminatory effect on hiring. Dr. White's benchmark, based on census data for employment category EEO 5, was not substantially different from Sunland's announced goal, based on population. Dr. White's analysis showed that Sunland's African American EEO 5 hiring for the period of 1976-1980 fell significantly (although not drastically) below his benchmark, while by the period 1981-1984, hiring approached his benchmark. A reasonable inference is that African American hiring improved from 1976 forward, reaching the announced goal for the period 1981-1984. The announced goal, however, fell substantially below what Title VII required: non-discriminatory hiring.</p>\n<p>In short, Sunland's administrators had the laudable goal of improving African American hiring. They chose a target employment rate, however, that fell far short of what would be produced by the non-discriminatory hiring the law required, because of a significant divergence between the African American share of the population in the geographic area and the African American share of applications for the positions here at issue. When the flawed target was implemented by hiring authorities, the result was discrimination against African Americans, albeit discrimination less severe than had been in place earlier, and less severe than undoubtedly still was in place among some other employers in Jackson and surrounding counties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS</i>\n</h2>\n<p>That there was employment discrimination at Sunland in the types of position at issue of course does not necessarily mean that the five plaintiffs now before the court were victims of that discrimination.

So long as the articulated reason is not based on race or other prohibited characteristics, it need not be a reason that seems wise or logical; under Title VII, an employer lawfully may take action for any non-discriminatory reason, good or bad, fair or unfair, or for no reason at all. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Combs v.

On this issue, the statistical and other evidence addressed in earlier sections of this order, as well as all other relevant evidence, may be considered.</p>\n<p>I find that each of the five plaintiffs now before the court has established a <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> prima facie case with respect to various positions; that the state has provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for some of the hiring decisions at issue but has failed to provide such reasons for many others; and that many of the proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons are clearly pretextual. I find that each plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination and that absent such discrimination each plaintiff would have been hired at Sunland during the period at issue. The reasons underlying these conclusions, with specific examples illustrating the reasoning, are set forth in the text below. An appendix to this order sets forth my conclusions with respect to each plaintiff and each specific position at issue.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Prima Facie Case</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff Gwenevere Long is African American. From July 1977 through some time in 1983, she submitted 15 to 20 applications per year to Sunland for positions including cottage parent, residential training <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1246</span> instructor, dietary worker, and laundry worker.<sup>[11]</sup> She was qualified for these positions.<sup>[12]</sup> She was never offered any job. Many of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[13]</sup> Ms. Long has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a prima facie case with respect to each such specifically identified position filled with a white person.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Queen Granberry is African American. She repeatedly applied for positions at Sunland from May 1969 (well before the beginning of the period at issue) through some time in 1980. Among the positions for which she applied were cottage parent, food service aide, residential training instructor, and beautician. She was qualified for these positions.<sup>[14]</sup> She was never offered any job. Many of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[15]</sup> Ms. Granberry has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a prima facie case with respect to each such specifically identified position filled with a white person.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Marinda Hayes is African American. She applied for positions at Sunland approximately eight or nine times per year from the early 1970s (well before the beginning of the period at issue) through some time in 1982. Among the positions for which she applied were cottage parent, food service aide, and cook. She was qualified for these positions.<sup>[16]</sup> She was never offered any job. At least some of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[17]</sup> Ms. Hayes has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1247</span> prima facie case with respect to the specifically identified positions filled with a white person.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Jennifer Pittman is African American. She applied for positions beginning in June 1977, left the geographic area and stopped applying later that year, returned and began applying again in March 1980. Among the positions for which she applied were cottage parent, food service aide, and custodian. She was qualified for these positions but was rejected many times.<sup>[18]</sup> Many of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[19]</sup> Ms. Pittman has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a prima facie case with respect to each such specifically identified position filled with a white person.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Erma Calhoun is African American. She constantly applied for positions at Sunland beginning in 1972 (well before the beginning of the period at issue) and continuing throughout the period at issue. Among the positions for which she applied were cottage parent, food service aide, nursing assistant, and laundry worker. She was qualified for these positions.<sup>[20]</sup> She was never offered any job. Many of the successful applicants were white.<sup>[21]</sup> Ms. Calhoun has met the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> four-part test establishing a prima facie case with respect to each such specifically identified position filled with a white person.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Alleged Non-Discriminatory Reasons</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Prior to trial, plaintiffs propounded to the state an interrogatory asking for Sunland's alleged legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for choosing the successful white applicant for every position at issue. The state responded with no specific reason for any decision. The state said that, if plaintiffs \"by competent substantial evidence can establish having applied for any other positions, then Defendants respond upon their best information and belief that the best qualified applicant was chosen.\" <i>See, e.g.</i> Pl.Ex. 71. Under the law of the circuit, such a general, conclusory assertion is not sufficient to meet the employer's burden of providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for a decision, in response to an employee's prima facie case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>IMPACT v. Firestone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534897\"><a href=\"/opinion/534897/52-fair-emplpraccas-71-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39662-increase-minority/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></a></span>, 1194 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>For some positions, the state failed to proffer any legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for selecting a white applicant over the plaintiff, other than the conclusory interrogatory answer.<sup>[22]</sup> With respect to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1248</span> those positions, plaintiffs are entitled to prevail, based on their presentation of an unrebutted prima facie case.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>For other positions, the state presented evidence at trial over and above its interrogatory answer. I admitted the evidence so that the record would be complete, notwithstanding the unfairness of allowing the state to proceed in this manner. The state's failure to answer the interrogatory with a candid description of the position it intended to present at trial was inexcusable.</p>\n<p>In addition, in many instances the non-discriminatory reason offered by the state at trial was merely an after-the-fact rationalization conjured by a person who did not participate in the hiring decision and did not know the true basis of the decision to hire the white winner. An employer does not meet its burden by proffering such an after-the-fact hypothesis; the employer's burden is to present \"admissible evidence\" of the actual reason for the action at issue. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span>, 255, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The unavailability of better proof, however, is not solely the state's fault. In a case alleging racial discrimination in a major state institution and seeking equitable relief, the state ought not lightly be foreclosed from presenting its best case on the merits. I thus have considered on the merits the evidence presented by the state at trial regarding Sunland's reasons for the hiring decisions at issue. For the most part, those reasons (if supported by evidence that they were the true reasons) would constitute legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons sufficient to carry the state's intermediate <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, for most positions for which the state offered testimony at trial of a reason why the white winner was selected over the plaintiff, I proceed on the assumption that the state has successfully met its intermediate burden, thus placing on plaintiffs the burden of proving, by the greater weight of the evidence, that each proffered reason was pretextual and that intentional discrimination was a reason for the hiring decision at issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1249</span> C. <i>Pretext</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Some of the state's proffered reasons for hiring decisions were not pretextual. The record establishes that, for the most part, Sunland gave a very strong preference to current Sunland employees over applicants from outside. Sunland gave a substantial, although not necessarily dispositive, preference to veterans. Sunland often, although not always, gave a preference to male applicants for some cottage parent positions (in at least some male cottages) and to female applicants for some cottage parent positions (in at least some female cottages).<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>Beyond these objectively verifiable preferences, however, the state's proffered explanations do not fare as well. The after-the-fact explanations offered by the state's witnesses did not have the ring of truth; they were unpersuasive and often contradictory.</p>\n<p>For example, Sunland hired Jeanette Bruner over plaintiffs Gwenevere Long and Jennifer Pittman for cottage parent position 11986 on January 23, 1981. The state proffered explanations that, first, Ms. Bruner was 40 years old and thus more mature, and second, Ms. Bruner raised six children, which is important experience. I find these explanations pretextual. Plaintiff Marinda Hayes was also approximately 40 years old when she applied for various positions, but that never seemed to help her. Plaintiff Erma Calhoun raised five children, but that never seemed to help her. Factors that are cited only when they help whites, not African Americans, are often pretexts for racial discrimination; I find that to be the case with respect to the reasons given for selecting Ms. Bruner. In fact, Ms. Long was a temporary employee at Sunland at the time of the application and had experience at other nursing facilities; Ms. Pittman had been a temporary employee at Sunland and a teacher's aide at an elementary school; and Ms. Bruner was an Avon salesperson. If there was a legitimate race-neutral reason for hiring Ms. Bruner over Ms. Long and Ms. Pittman, this record does not reflect it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the state's proffered explanation for choosing William Pierce over Ms. Long and Ms. Pittman for cottage parent position 11946 on May 12, 1982, was that he had experience with Sunland clients and staff through his experience with the Washington County School Board. But as of the date of his application, Mr. Pierce had been a teacher's aide for only a month. His other work experience was less than a year shipping and receiving at a uniform company in Tennessee. Ms. Long had spent six months as a CETA employee at Sunland itself and had two years experience at a nearby nursing facility. Ms. Pittman had three months experience at Sunland itself and a year as a teacher's aide in an elementary school. If there was a legitimate race-neutral reason for hiring Mr. Pierce over Ms. Long and Ms. Pittman, this record does not reflect it.</p>\n<p>The state's proffered explanation for choosing Rhonda Reddoch over plaintiff Queen Granberry for cottage parent position 12054 filled October 26, 1979, was that Ms. Reddoch had two children and a high school diploma. Ms. Reddoch had not worked for seven years as of that time. Plaintiff Erma Calhoun had five children and a high school diploma but was never hired; the state did not attempt to explain why Ms. Reddoch's children and high school diploma netted her a job while Ms. Calhoun's similar credentials did not. In any event, Ms. Granberry, who lost out to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1250</span> Ms. Reddoch, also had a high school diploma, and, in addition, Ms. Granberry had cared for her grandmother and a deaf mute aunt for many years, had worked for a year as a teacher's aide and at Sunland as a temporary CETA employee, and had been continuously employed for eight years (a factor cited by the state as a positive factor for successful white applicants). If there was a legitimate raceneutral reason for hiring Ms. Reddoch over Ms. Granberry, this record does not reflect it.</p>\n<p>The state's proffered reason for choosing Mary Lou Elmore over Ms. Granberry for cottage parent position 12031 on February 15, 1980, was that Ms. Elmore was at that time a temporary worker at Sunland. From Ms. Elmore's application, however, it appears she did not even meet the minimum qualifications for the cottage parent position; she had neither a high school education nor enough experience to substitute year for year for the missing education, as required by the written job qualifications. In any event, Ms. Granberry was clearly better qualified than Ms. Elmore. I find the explanation for the hiring of Ms. Elmore pretextual.</p>\n<p>The state's proffered reason for hiring James Gesslein over plaintiff Marinda Hayes for cottage parent position 12005 was that he had 40 hours of junior college credit and had been an orderly at a nursing home. Mr. Gesslein's application reflected one semester of junior college and six months work at the nursing home.<sup>[27]</sup> Ms. Hayes had two years of college and almost 18 months as a part-time care giver. If there was a legitimate race-neutral reason for hiring Mr. Gesslein over Ms. Hayes, this record does not reflect it.</p>\n<p>The state's proffered reason for choosing Donald Perry over plaintiff Jennifer Pittman for service aide position 11630 on April 15, 1983, was that Mr. Perry had done a good job while working at Sunland on a prison release program. Mr. Perry had no high school diploma, had served time in prison for grand theft, and listed as work experience only two day laborer positions of less than a year combined. Ms. Pittman had a high school diploma, was at that time a current Sunland custodial employee (thus qualifying for the virtually dispositive preference for current employees), had additional prior experience at Sunland, and had additional experience as a teacher's aide. There is no evidence that Ms. Pittman had not done good work in her two Sunland positions. I find pretextual the assertion that Mr. Perry was hired because of his good work in the prison release program.</p>\n<p>Finally, the state's proffered reasons for choosing Linwood Daffin over plaintiffs Erma Calhoun and Queen Granberry for cottage parent position 11963 on November 16, 1979, included that this was a position in a male cottage, that Mr. Daffin had a bachelor's degree, that Mr. Daffin worked with other inmates as a chaplain while he was serving a two-year drug trafficking sentence, and that Mr. Daffin had changed jobs four times in three years, showing his willingness to work. But the state interviewed at least three women for the position (including Ms. Granberry), suggesting this was not a \"male position.\" Ms. Calhoun and Ms. Granberry both had experience in patient care facilities much more relevant than experience as a chaplain to fellow prisoners. Mr. Daffin's frequent job changes were hardly a positive factor.<sup>[28]</sup> And in any event, Ms. Calhoun <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1251</span> and Ms. Pittman also were willing to work (as confirmed by their own work histories and by their many applications to Sunland). Commendable as Sunland's willingness to offer employment to a convicted felon may have been, the state did not suggest this was a reason for preferring Mr. Daffin over applicants with no criminal record. I find pretextual the state's proffered reasons for selecting Mr. Daffin over Ms. Calhoun and Ms. Pittman.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Intentional Discrimination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>That plaintiffs have shown that some of the state's proffered explanations for hiring decisions were pretextual does not end the matter. A finding of pretext permits, but does not require, a finding that a plaintiff has been the victim of intentional discrimination.</p>\n<p>I find that each of these five plaintiffs was well qualified for the positions at issue. Each had a high school diploma and significant care-giving experience. Each was intelligent, poised and articulate when she testified at trial.</p>\n<p>I find that each plaintiff would have been hired if the hiring process had been conducted without racial discrimination. I find that each plaintiff was a victim of intentional racial discrimination in each instance for which she established a prima facie case and either (1) the state failed to present a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its decision or (2) the state's proffered reason was pretextual. Intentional racial discrimination is the only reasonable explanation for the clear pattern of hiring decisions at Sunland during the period 1976-1984. Had it not been for that discrimination, plaintiffs would have been hired for jobs that instead went to whites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusion</i></h2>\n<p>The five plaintiffs now before the court were well qualified for positions for which they applied at Sunland during the 1976-1984 period. But for intentional racial discrimination, they would have been hired. Accordingly,</p>\n<p>IT IS ORDERED:</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs Gwenevere Long, Queen Granberry, Marinda Hayes, Jennifer Pittman and Erma Calhoun are hereby determined to be entitled to prevail on the issue of liability, subject to defenses relating to the filing of administrative charges. I do <i>not</i> direct the entry of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). By separate notice, the clerk shall set a scheduling conference, at which the scope, sequence and timing of further proceedings, including the desirability of further mediation, will be addressed. The attorneys shall confer with one another at least five days prior to the scheduling conference in a good faith effort to reach agreement on all such issues and shall be prepared to announce any agreements on such issues at the scheduling conference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX 1</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>GWENEVERE LONG</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Successful Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<blockquote>A.

For case of reference, this order refers to the defendants collectively as \"the state.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  The job description labeled this \"routine work\" with duties including \"restraining overactive or disciplinary problem retardates, assisting retardates in personal hygiene activities, dispensing prescribed medications and performing general custodial work in the residential cottages.\" The job description included as examples of work performed training or assisting residents in personal hygiene activities, escorting them to and from the dining room or other facilities, feeding residents who could not feed themselves and assisting others, performing laundry and custodial duties, and observing residents for behavioral changes. (Pl.Ex.65.)</p>\n<p>[3]  The use of the terminology \"prima facie case\" in <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> is perhaps unfortunate. The term \"prima facie case\" is sometimes used in other contexts to mean the elements on which the plaintiff <i>must</i> present evidence in order to have the matter submitted to the finder of fact. In Title VII cases, however, a plaintiff need not proceed under <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> at all; as is beyond dispute, a plaintiff may proceed based on \"direct evidence\" of intentional discrimination without prop of a <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> \"prima facie case.\" The better view is that a plaintiff also may proceed based on any other evidence from which a finder of fact reasonably could find intentional discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Wright v.

The contrary view would be inconsistent with the plain language of Title VII (which allows recovery for intentional discrimination), the Federal Rules of Evidence and particularly Rule 402 (which provide that relevant evidence generally is admissible and do not restrict proof to a particular method), and cases allowing other plaintiffs (either the government or class representatives) to use other methods of proof with respect to precisely the same substantive Title VII standard (that is, the same issue of intentional discrimination). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>International Bhd. of Teamsters v.

Bowman Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109404\"><a href=\"/opinion/109404/franks-v-bowman-transp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109404\"><a href=\"/opinion/109404/franks-v-bowman-transp-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span> (1976). Under the law of the circuit, however, the same rule apparently does not apply in individual actions such as the case at bar. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Carter v. Three Springs Residential Treatment,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749848\"><a href=\"/opinion/749848/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1635-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45148-11-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 642 n. 5 (11th Cir.1998) (asserting that statistics alone cannot carry plaintiff's burden of production in individual disparate treatment case); <i>Carmichael v.

Thus in an individual action, the initial burden of production and the ultimate burden of persuasion are on the plaintiff; and a pattern and practice showing, without more, apparently would not be sufficient to carry either burden.</p>\n<p>[5]  Dr. White relied in part on work done earlier by other professionals in his firm. For convenience, I refer to Dr. White to mean not only Dr. White personally but also the others whose work he presented at trial.</p>\n<p>[6]  Dr. White of course is correct that census data may appropriately be considered when reliable applicant flow data are unavailable. Census data also may be considered even when reliable applicant flow data are available. Whether census data are probative, and what they prove, depend on the factual circumstances of the particular case. I have considered the census data and Dr. White's analysis, together with all the evidence in this case, and make the findings and conclusions set forth in the text.</p>\n<p>[7]  Dr. White did assert that prior to 1985, there was a \"preference\" for applicants for the position of cottage parent who were high school graduates, and he suggested that the elimination of this preference in 1985 may have affected hiring by race. The evidence does not support that claim. During the period 1980-1984, the job description for cottage parent required a high school diploma but provided, \"Experience in rearing a family or in related custodial or nursing environments may be substituted on a year-for-year basis for the high school education requirement.\" (Def.Ex.61C.) No preference was given as between applicants with a high school diploma, on the one hand, and applicants with qualifying substitute experience, on the other. In any event, there is no evidence in this record regarding the relative high school graduation rates or substitute experience rates among applicants by race; there is thus no evidence that elimination of the high-school-or-substitute-experience requirement affected hiring by race. More importantly, beginning in 1985, there clearly was no high school requirement. Dr. White has offered no explanation for why Sunland hired more than 50% African Americans in category EEO 5 for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987, if indeed the appropriate benchmark for those years was 30.9%, as he asserts. That hiring in 1985-1987 was consistent with Dr. Rasmussen's benchmark, not with Dr. White's benchmark, had nothing to do with high school diplomas, which clearly were not required in those years. And finally, Dr. Rasmussen's analysis showing the appropriate benchmark as 50% for 1984 and earlier used state lists of <i>qualified</i> applicants, that is, applicants who met the requirement for high school or substitute experience. (The state says those lists were imperfect, and presumably they were, but there is no reason to believe there were material errors or errors skewed along racial lines.)</p>\n<p>[8]  This was the testimony of Melvin L. Herring and Joseph Kennedy. Nobody testified that Sunland's goal at the time was to have hiring mirror the racial distribution of qualified applicants (as one would expect, on average, from nondiscriminatory hiring). The state's affirmative action studies did show applicant flow data, but the testimony was that the actual goal at the facility was based on population.</p>\n<p>[9]  If applicants were 50% African American and 50% white but hiring authorities were told to hire 30% African Americans, then hiring authorities were free to hire whites more than twice as frequently as African Americans (70% compared to 30%), despite receiving equal numbers of applications. A system that gives whites more than twice the chance of being hired, other things being equal, is discriminatory.</p>\n<p>[10]  The positions listed in the appendices are culled from the following sources: (1) application documentation submitted by the parties, (2) plaintiffs' handwritten charts listing all positions applied for during the relevant time period, and (3) positions listed in the state's contemporaneous documentation (Forms 900) as having been applied for by plaintiffs. Findings with respect to the positions are derived from the testimony at trial and all exhibits. The appendices have been compiled without benefit of proposed findings of fact or other detailed submissions from the parties after trial. If any party asserts there are specific factual errors in the appendices or in this order, the party should raise the issue by motion for reconsideration, supported by specific citation to appropriate record sources.</p>\n<p>[11]  This was Ms. Long's uncontradicted testimony. Records no longer exist of all applications for these positions. Documentary evidence does, however, confirm some of Ms. Long's applications. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Pl.Ex. 20B, 20C &amp; 20G; Def.Ex. 65 E-1, E-2 &amp; E-6.</p>\n<p>[12]  Ms. Long received her high school diploma in 1976. Her work experience in the field of providing residential care included almost a year as a dietary aide at Marianna Convalescent Center, a nursing home; more than a year as a nurse's aide at Marianna Convalescent Center; a period beginning in December 1979 as a nurse's aide at Jackson County Convalescent Center; and six-month periods in 1973 and 1980 working in cottages at Sunland under the CETA program. As confirmation she met the minimum requirements of the jobs, Ms. Long was interviewed twice for the position of cottage parent and at least once for resident training instructor.</p>\n<p>[13]  This is a reasonable inference from the number of applications submitted and the percentage of whites hired for positions of this type. In addition, the record includes documentation that for many of the positions for which Ms. Long applied, the successful applicant was white. Examples include cottage parent position 12031 filled February 15, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 20B; Def.Ex. 65 E-1); cottage parent position 12017 filled September 26, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 20C; Def.Ex. 65 E-2); and cottage parent position 11986 filled January 23, 1981 (Pl.Ex. 20L; Def.Ex. 65 E-11).</p>\n<p>[14]  Ms. Granberry graduated from high school in 1967. She received a cosmetology certificate from a junior college in 1968 and maintained a cosmetology license. Her relevant experience included one year as a teacher's aide at a high school and a summer as a CETA worker at Sunland, in addition to caring for her grandmother for three years and for a deaf mute aunt for 15 years. These credentials easily met the qualifications for the positions noted in the text. Ms. Granberry also applied for secretary and clerk-typist positions but was not qualified because she did not have the required state typing certification.</p>\n<p>[15]  Examples include cottage parent position 11986 filled September 28, 1979 (Pl.Ex. 23G; Def.Ex. 65 F. -1); cottage parent position 12053 filled October 26, 1979 (Pl.Ex.23J); (Def.Ex. 65 F. -4); and cottage parent position 12036 filled May 9, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 23T; Def.Ex. 65 F-13).</p>\n<p>[16]  Ms. Hayes graduated from high school in 1961. Her relevant experience included caring for her 88-year-old grandmother, caring for her blind uncle, assisting in caring for her ten siblings, and working as a private caretaker for an individual. These credentials easily met the qualifications for the positions noted in the text. Ms. Hayes also applied for secretary and clerk-typist positions but was not qualified because she did not have the required state typing certification.</p>\n<p>[17]  Examples include cottage parent position 11904 filled on or about January 19, 1982 (Pl.Ex. 24A; Def.Ex. 65 G-1); and cottage parent position 12005 filled on or about January 19, 1982 (Def.Ex. 65 G-1).</p>\n<p>[18]  Ms. Pittman graduated from high school in 1977. Her relevant experience included three months as a CETA worker at Sunland. Ms. Pittman thus clearly was qualified for the position of cottage parent. In addition, she was offered and accepted positions at Sunland as custodian in October 1982 and food service aide in July 1983; she thus clearly was qualified for those positions. The record does not establish that she met the minimum qualifications for other positions for which she applied, including residential training instructor, security guard, trades helper, and nursing assistant.</p>\n<p>[19]  Examples include cottage parent position 11909 filled January 16, 1981 (Pl.Ex. 28C; Def.Ex. 65 H-1); cottage parent position 11986 filled January 23, 1981 (Pl.Ex. 28B; Def.Ex. 65 H-2); and cottage parent position 12020 filled on or about July 1981 (Pl.Ex. 28H; Def.Ex. 65 H-6).</p>\n<p>[20]  Ms. Calhoun graduated from high school in 1973. Her relevant experience included more than four years at Florida State Hospital, the state's public mental health in-patient facility, as a psychological aide and doing food service, housekeeping and custodial work. She also raised five children. These credentials easily met the qualifications for the positions noted in the text. Ms. Calhoun also applied for positions of resident training instructor, cook II, and human service worker, but the record does not establish that she was qualified for these positions.</p>\n<p>[21]  Examples include cottage parent position 12005 filled on or about February 19, 1982 (Pl.Ex. 26Y; Def.Ex. 65 I-22); cottage parent position 12055 filled on January 16, 1981 (Def.Ex. 65 I-17); and cottage parent position 11932 filled on February 19, 1982 (Pl.Ex. 36Z; Def.Ex. 65 I-21).</p>\n<p>[22]  Examples include cottage parent position 12031 filled February 15, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 20B; Def.Ex. 65 E-1) and cottage parent position 12014 filled October 17, 1980 (Pl.Ex. 20G).</p>\n<p>[23]  I credit the prima facie case presented by each plaintiff. I do not credit the state's conclusory assertion that the person hired for each such position was better qualified than the plaintiff. That conclusory assertion (1) is insufficient as a matter of law to carry the employer's burden under <i>McDonnell Douglas;</i> (2) has not been supported by admissible testimony of any person with knowledge of the hiring decisions; (3) is contrary to evidence that in many instances the white winner was not better qualified than unsuccessful African American applicants including plaintiffs; and (4) is not credible.</p>\n<p>[24]  <i>See also </i><i>McDonald v.

I assume, for purposes of this case, that the state could properly prefer cottage parents of the same gender as residents for the performance of some of the cottage parents' duties (for example, assisting residents with bathing or toilet functions). In any event, plaintiffs' complaint in the case at bar alleges only racial discrimination, not gender discrimination. Thus, for purposes of this case, if the state applied any gender preference equally to whites and African Americans, the gender preference would not provide a basis for recovery.</p>\n<p>[27]  Mr. Gesslein's employment history also showed frequent job changes, presumably a negative factor.</p>\n<p>[28]  Indeed, the state cited on another occasion a successful white applicant's long tenure in a job as a positive factor, showing stability. The pattern of the state's explanations on this at trial was that long tenure of a successful white applicant was a positive factor, and frequent job changes by a successful white applicant was a positive factor. Even not having been employed at all for a long period was not a negative factor for a successful white applicant. But the plaintiffs' work records were never a positive factor, or at least not positive enough to overcome whatever work record the successful white applicant happened to have. The state's explanations were pretextual.</p>\n\n</div>",
