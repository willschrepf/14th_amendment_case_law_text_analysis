It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th\nCir. R. 32.1.\n\fof this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is\n\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n      Stephen Sparks, a Colorado state prisoner, brought a 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\naction complaining about the condition of his confinement. Appearing pro se, he\n\nappeals from the district court’s judgment granting defendants’ motions to\n\ndismiss and summary judgment. W e affirm.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n      Sometime in 1995, Sparks claims to have been incorrectly labeled a gang\n\nmember by Lieutenant Foster w hile at the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility.\n\nUpon transfer to the Limon Correctional Facility, Sparks learned he was\n\nconsidered a security threat and classified within a Security Threat Group (STG).\n\nLater, Sparks was moved to the Sterling Correctional Facility. W hile there,\n\nSparks claims to have been told by Lieutenant Hoffman that he was considered a\n\nleading member of a prison gang called “The Family.” W hen Sparks asked if he\n\ncould file a grievance to prove he is not a gang member, Lieutenant Hoffman said\n\nno.\n\n      Sometime later, Sparks also claims: Captain Nycz at the Sterling\n\nCorrectional Facility forced him to cross a prisoner strike to work in the kitchen\n\ndespite inmate threats to any prisoner who crossed the line; he was selected based\n\non his STG classification and because the prison officials intended to use his\n\nleadership role within the prison population to diffuse the volatile situation;\n\n                                          -2-\n\fLieutenant M agelson of the Sterling Correctional Facility threatened him with\n\nadministrative segregation if he refused the assignment; and the assignment put\n\nhim in charge of other inmates and forced him to do the guard’s job. Sparks\n\nbelieves being labeled a member of “The Family” by prison officials and being\n\nforced to cross the strike line placed his life in danger with rival gangs.\n\n      On October 17, 2003, while still housed at the Sterling Correctional\n\nFacility, Sparks filed an amended complaint against Lieutenant Foster of the\n\nArkansas Valley Correctional Facility; Lieutenants Smelzer and Strode of the\n\nLimon Correctional Facility; and Lieutenants H offman, M agelson and Captain\n\nNycz of the Sterling Correctional Facility. Sparks asserted the defendants\n\nviolated his: (1) Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, (2)\n\nSixth Amendment right to confrontation and (3) Eighth Amendment right to be\n\nfree of cruel and unusual punishment. He sought monetary damages and\n\ninjunctive relief to require prison authorities to establish a procedure for prisoners\n\nto challenge gang or STG classification and to have his name removed from the\n\nSTG list.\n\n      Sparks’ Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment claims rested on the same\n\nfactual assertions. He claimed the defendants denied him the equal protections of\n\nlife and liberty by falsely accusing him of being a gang member without due\n\nprocess of law and the unwarranted label of being a gang member of “The\n\nFamily” constitutes cruel and unusual punishment because it put his life in danger\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwith rival gangs. Further, he claims Nycz, Hoffman and M agelson placed his life\n\nin danger w hen they forced him to cross a prisoner work strike in the facility\n\nkitchen at Sterling Correctional Facility, knowing of threats made against anyone\n\nwho crossed the picket line. Sparks’ Sixth Amendment right to confrontation\n\nclaim was based on the fact he was unable to present witnesses to disprove any\n\ngang affiliation.\n\n      A. M otion To D ismiss\n\n      On M arch 4, 2004, defendants filed a motion to dismiss Sparks’ claims.\n\nThe matter was referred to a magistrate judge who issued a Recommendation for\n\nPartial Dismissal on December 2, 2004. Sparks filed an objection to the\n\nmagistrate’s Recommendation on January 6, 2005. Based in part on the\n\nmagistrate judge’s recommendations, on February 2, 2005, the district judge\n\ndismissed Sparks’ Fourteenth Amendment claim with prejudice because the\n\nColorado prison rules and regulations do not create a liberty interest in not being\n\nlabeled a gang member. The district judge also dismissed Sparks’ Sixth\n\nAmendment claim with prejudice, reasoning the Sixth Amendment only applies to\n\ncriminal proceedings and the gang classification is not a criminal proceeding.\n\nThe district court did not dismiss the Eighth Amendment claim.\n\n      The district judge concluded Sparks’ allegations were sufficient to raise a\n\nquestion whether the defendants deliberately exposed Sparks to harm at the hands\n\nof other inmates. Addressing Sparks’ Eighth Amendment claim against the\n\n                                         -4-\n\fdefendants in their official capacities, it determined the Eleventh Amendment\n\nprecluded Sparks’ claim for monetary damages. Although Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity does not apply to injunctive relief, the district court held injunctive\n\nrelief was moot as to all defendants except Foster, the only defendant currently\n\nemployed at the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility. 1\n\n      As to the Eighth Amendment claims against defendants in their individual\n\ncapacities, the district court denied the motion to dismiss because Sparks had\n\nsufficiently pled an Eighth Amendment claim to warrant monetary damages under\n\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).\n\n      B. M otion for Summary Judgment\n\n      After the district court ruled on the M otion to Dismiss, defendants filed a\n\nM otion for Summary Judgment. Among other arguments, the defendants asserted\n\nSparks failed to exhaust available administrative remedies under the PLRA, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1997e(a) by failing to use the administrative grievance process. Sparks\n\nfiled a “M otion to Deny Defendant(s) M otion for Summary Judgment” and\n\nincluded affidavits regarding the merits of his claims, but did not address the\n\nissue of exhaustion. The summary judgment motion was referred to the\n\nmagistrate judge who recommended defendants’ motion be granted in part and the\n\n      1\n         Prior to the district judge’s ruling, Sparks was transferred back to the\nArkansas V alley Correctional Facility. Contrary to the ruling, however,\nLieutenant Foster left his position at the Arkansas V alley Correctional Facility to\nbecome an STG coordinator at the Colorado State Penitentiary several years prior\nto this complaint being filed.\n\n                                         -5-\n\flaw suit dismissed without prejudice in its entirety based upon Sparks’ failure to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies. Sparks filed an objection to the magistrate\n\njudge’s recommendation on December 20, 2005. In it, Sparks claimed for the\n\nfirst time “[a] trial would reveal through records held by the defendants that the\n\nPlaintiff did attempt to exhaust administrative remedies, by requesting from\n\nfacility chain of command, starting with Plaintiffs’ Case M anager Olsen, to Head\n\nCase M anager Clarkson, and assistant W arden Soares, a grievance on the issue of\n\nbeing forced to work in a hostile area, as a tool to defuse a facility uprising.” (R.\n\nVol. I, Doc. 77 at 2.) Sparks further asserted that once the authorities declined to\n\nissue a grievance the issue was ended.\n\n      On February 21, 2006, the district court ruled on the defendants’ M otion\n\nfor Summary Judgment after considering the magistrate judge’s recommendations.\n\nThe district judge deemed Sparks’ objections to the magistrate’s recommendation\n\nas timely and conducted a de novo review of his objections. The district court\n\ngranted the summary judgment motion and dismissed Sparks’ Eighth Amendment\n\nclaims without prejudice because Sparks failed to prove he exhausted the\n\navailable administrative remedies. A separate judgment dismissing Sparks’\n\ncomplaint with prejudice was entered on February 22, 2006, which incorporated\n\nboth the order granting partial dismissal and the order granting summary\n\njudgment for the defendants.\n\n      Sparks filed a notice of appeal and motion to proceed in form a pauperis\n\n                                          -6-\n\f(ifp) on M arch 22, 2006. The district court denied Sparks’ motion to proceed ifp\n\non April 17, 2006. It determined, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3), the appeal\n\nwas not taken in good faith because Sparks did not show the existence of a\n\nreasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues\n\nraised on appeal. Sparks renew ed his ifp application with this Court and\n\nconsented to the disbursement of partial payments from his prison account toward\n\nthe filing fee.\n\n                                    II. Discussion\n\n       A. Fourteenth and Sixth Amendment Claims\n\n       W e review the district court’s dismissal of Sparks’ claims de novo pursuant\n\nto Rule 12(b)(6), accepting all well-pleaded allegations as true and viewing them\n\nin the light most favorable to Sparks. See Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the Deaf\n\n& Blind, 173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir. 1999). Because Sparks appears pro se,\n\nwe review his pleadings and other papers liberally and hold them to a less\n\nstringent standard than those drafted by attorneys. See Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d\n\n1106, 1110 & n.3 (10th Cir. 1991). Dismissal of a pro se complaint under Rule\n\n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim “is proper only where it is obvious that the\n\nplaintiff cannot prevail on the facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give\n\nhim an opportunity to amend.” Oxendine v. Kaplan, 241 F.3d 1272, 1275 (10th\n\nCir. 2001) (quotation omitted).\n\n       Sparks asserts he was denied Fourteenth Amendment procedural due\n\n                                          -7-\n\fprocess and Sixth Amendment right to confrontation because he was not afforded\n\nthe opportunity to present witnesses and produce evidence to demonstrate he is\n\nnot a gang member. A due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment can\n\nonly be maintained where the government has interfered with a constitutionally\n\ncognizable liberty or property interest. See Bd. of Regents of State C olls. v. Roth,\n\n408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972). Changing a prisoner’s classification generally does not\n\ndeprive him of liberty under the due process clause alone. Hewitt v. Helms, 459\n\nU.S. 460, 468 (1983), overruled on other grounds by Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S.\n\n472, 479-83 (1995). A liberty interest may be implicated, however, when State\n\nlaws and prison regulations create a liberty interest to w hich due process\n\nprotections apply. M eachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 226, 229 (1976).\n\n         In Colorado, “[c]lassification decisions are within the discretion of the\n\nDepartment of Corrections and a particular classification does not implicate any\n\nliberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.”\n\nGreen v. Nadeau, 70 P.3d 574, 577 (Colo. App. 2003) (citing Deason v. Kautzky,\n\n786 P.2d 420, 422 (Colo. 1990) (en banc)). Because Sparks does not have a\n\nliberty interest in a particular classification, be it a gang member or within an\n\nSTG, he cannot maintain an action based on the classification under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the district court properly dismissed Sparks’\n\nclaim.\n\n         The district court also properly dismissed Sparks’ Sixth Amendment claim.\n\n                                            -8-\n\f“The protections provided by the Sixth Amendment are explicitly confined to\n\n‘criminal prosecutions.’” United States v. Deninno, 103 F.3d 82, 86 (10th Cir.\n\n1996) (quoting Austin v. United States, 509 U .S. 602, 608 (1993)). Sparks’\n\nclassification as a gang member was an administrative decision made by the\n\nDepartment of Corrections and not part of a criminal prosecution.\n\n      B. Eighth Amendment Claim\n\n      The district court granted the defendants’ M otion for Summary Judgment\n\nand dismissed Sparks’ Eighth A mendment claim for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies. A district court’s finding of failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies and grant of summary judgment are reviewed de novo.\n\nFitzgerald v. C orrections C orp. of Am., 403 F.3d 1134, 1138, 1140 (10th Cir.\n\n2005). W e apply the same legal standard on review of summary judgment as the\n\ndistrict court. Id. at 1140. W e may “affirm a district court decision on any\n\ngrounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law, even\n\ngrounds not relied upon by the district court.” United States v. Sandoval, 29 F.3d\n\n537, 542 n.6 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n      The PLRA requires prisoners to exhaust available administrative remedies\n\nbefore bringing an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in federal court. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997e(a); Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002). At the time of the district\n\ncourt’s decision, our precedent required prisoners to affirmatively plead\n\nexhaustion. See Steele v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 355 F.3d 1204, 1210 (10th\n\n                                         -9-\n\fCir. 2003) (concluding § 1997e(a) imposes a pleading requirement on the\n\nprisoner). During the pendency of this appeal, the Supreme Court issued Jones v.\n\nBock, wherein it determined “that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense\n\nunder the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specifically plead or\n\ndemonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.” 127 S.Ct. 910, 921 (2007).\n\nW hether a pleading requirement or the subject of an affirmative defense, “there is\n\nno question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted\n\nclaims cannot be brought in court.” Id. at 918-19 (citing Porter, 534 U.S. at 524).\n\n      W hen raising an affirmative defense in a motion for summary judgment,\n\n“[t]he defendant . . . must demonstrate that no disputed material fact exists\n\nregarding the affirmative defense asserted.” Hutchinson v. Pfeil, 105 F.3d 562,\n\n564 (10th Cir. 1997) (citing M iller v. Shell Oil Co., 345 F.2d 891, 893 (10th Cir.\n\n1965)). “If the defendant meets this initial burden, the plaintiff must then\n\ndemonstrate with specificity the existence of a disputed material fact.” Id. “If\n\nthe plaintiff fails to make such a showing, the affirmative defense bars his claim,\n\nand the defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.” Id.\n\n      Here, appellees referred to Colorado Department of Corrections\n\nAdministrative Regulation No. 850-4 which requires an inmate to file a grievance\n\nno later than thirty days from the date the offender knew or should have known of\n\nthe facts giving rise to a grievance. They then noted Sparks alleged he could not\n\nfile a grievance for classification issues but he made no such allegation with\n\n                                         -10-\n\fregard to the violation of his Eighth Amendment rights in association with his\n\ntemporary job assignment in the facility kitchen. Therefore, they contend Sparks’\n\nclaim should be dismissed because he failed to exhaust his remedies. 2\n\n      In his response, Sparks did not mention the exhaustion argument. Although\n\nhe attached two sworn affidavits he authored and numerous grievances, none of\n\nthe materials referenced his Eighth Amendment claim. Rather, he apparently\n\nrelied on his amended complaint, wherein he checked a box indicating he\n\nexhausted the available administrative remedies and explained a prisoner’s\n\nclassification cannot be complained of in the prison system, thus he is allowed to\n\nseek direct relief in court. However, in objection to the magistrate’s\n\nrecommendation for summary judgment based on exhaustion, Sparks claimed he\n\nattempted to exhaust administrative remedies but w as denied the opportunity.\n\nThis was the first time Sparks responded to the failure to exhaust claim.\n\n      In granting the summary judgment motion, the district court determined\n\nthat Sparks failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies for his Eighth\n\nAmendment claim. The district court determined Sparks’ request for a review of\n\n\n\n      2\n        The appellees never filed an answer to Sparks’ complaint or raised the\nissue of exhaustion in their M otion to D ismiss. The issue of exhaustion was first\nraised in their M otion for Summary Judgment.\n       Ordinarily, it is best to plead an affirmative defense in an answer or\namended answer. Ahmad v. Furlong, 435 F.3d 1196, 1202 (10th Cir. 2006).\nHowever, “a defendant may use a motion for summary judgment to test an\naffirmative defense which entitles that party to a judgment as a matter of law.”\nHutchinson, 105 F.3d at 564.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fthe issue does not satisfy the exhaustion requirement because he had to file an\n\ninmate grievance and seek intermediate and final administrative review if the\n\nprison authorities deny the requested relief.\n\n       Sparks asserts on appeal the district court incorrectly ruled on this issue.\n\nHe repeats his argument that administrative review of the issue is foreclosed by\n\nregulation, pointing to the Colorado Department of Corrections Administrative\n\nRegulations grievance procedures which prohibit a grievance for prisoner\n\nclassification. See Colorado Department of Corrections, Admin. Reg. No. 850-04\n\n(A ugust 1, 2003) (“This grievance procedure may not be used to seek review of . .\n\n. classification . . . . Classification is entirely at the discretion of the\n\nadministrative head and classification committee of each institution.”). 3 He now\n\nfurther asserts his case manager determined, because the classification comm ittee\n\nplaced him in the facility kitchen during the prison uprising, his grievance w as a\n\nclassification issue and not subject to review through the grievance procedures.\n\nIn his reply brief, Sparks alleges he requested a grievance on the issue, but his\n\ncase manager directly prevented him from filing grievances.\n\n       Other circuits have held that administrative remedies are not “available”\n\nwhen prison officials refuse to provide prisoners with grievance forms. See\n\n       3\n         Other portions of this regulation have been amended since Sparks filed his\ncomplaint. The amended regulation provides the same prohibition on filing\nclassification grievances with a different indexing format. See Colorado\nDepartment of Corrections, Admin. Reg. No. 850-04(IV)(A)(4) (effective Dec.\n15, 2006).\n\n                                            -12-\n\fM itchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523, 529 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding the district court\n\nerred in dismissing inmate’s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies when court did not address inmate’s allegation that prison officials\n\nfailed to provide necessary grievance forms); M iller v. Norris, 247 F.3d 736, 738,\n\n740 (8th Cir. 2001) (“W e believe that a remedy that prison officials prevent a\n\nprisoner from ‘utiliz[ing]’ is not an ‘available’ remedy under § 1997e(a) . . . .”). 4\n\nSparks’ attempts to frame the issue under this precedent on appeal is too little, too\n\nlate.\n\n        W hile Sparks’ objection to the magistrate’s recommendation was both\n\ntimely and specific, as required by Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, the issue of being denied a grievance form was never brought before\n\nthe magistrate judge for consideration. “In this circuit, theories raised for the\n\nfirst time in objections to the magistrate judge’s report are deemed waived.”\n\nUnited States v. Garfinkle, 261 F.3d 1030, 1032 (10th Cir. 2001). Furthermore,\n\n\n\n        4\n         W e have cited to either one or both of these cases favorably in a number\nof unpublished opinions.

See Rice v. United States, 166 F.3d\n\n1088, 1091-92 (10th Cir. 1999). “W hen a motion for summary judgment is made\n\nand supported [by affidavits with sworn or certified papers], an adverse party may\n\nnot rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party’s pleading, but\n\nthe adverse party’s response, by affidavits or as otherw ise provided in [Rule 56],\n\nmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(e). Sparks’ allegation of being denied a grievance form was not\n\nsupported by sworn pleadings, affidavit, or other evidentiary material. Phillips v.\n\nCalhoun, 956 F.2d 949, 951 n.3 (10th Cir. 1992) (“Unsubstantiated allegations\n\ncarry no probative weight in summary judgment proceedings.”). In this context,\n\nSparks w as required to go beyond his pleadings and set forth specific facts to\n\nshow he was denied grievance forms or was prevented from exhausting available\n\nadministrative remedies. “Rule 56(e) permits a proper summary judgment motion\n\nto be opposed by any of the kinds of evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c),\n\nexcept the mere pleadings themselves . . . .” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n\n317, 324 (1986). Sparks obviously knew the value of an affidavit, since he\n\nsubmitted two attached to his summary judgment response brief. The absence of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fany evidence, other than Sparks’ allegations, is insufficient to preserve the issue. 5\n\n      To the extent Sparks believes other reasons excused him from exhausting\n\nadministrative remedies, he is mistaken. “Even when [a] prisoner seeks relief not\n\navailable in grievance proceedings . . . exhaustion is a prerequisite to suit.”\n\nPorter, 534 U.S. at 524. Thus, Sparks’ claim the administrative procedures w ere\n\nfutile does not excuse a lack of exhaustion. The Supreme Court has stressed it\n\n“will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements\n\nwhere Congress has provided otherwise.” Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741\n\nn.6 (2001).\n\n      Regarding Sparks’ renewed application to proceed ifp on appeal, we have\n\nreview ed his contentions and adopt the district court’s finding that this appeal is\n\nnot taken in good faith. Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 446 (1962).\n\n\n\n\n      5\n         W e note the district court declined to address the remaining arguments\nmade by the appellees in support of summary judgment, in part, because of the\ntotal exhaustion rule. See Ross v. County of Bernalillo, 365 F.3d 1181, 1188-90\n(10th Cir. 2004) (holding where a prisoner submits a complaint with one or more\nunexhausted claims the district court should ordinarily dismiss the entire action\nwithout prejudice). The Supreme Court specifically rejected this rule in Jones v.\nBock. 127 S.Ct. at 923-26. In addition to declaring PLRA exhaustion an\naffirmative defense, the Supreme Court determined the total exhaustion rule does\nnot “comport with the purpose of the PLRA to reduce the quantity of inmate\nsuits.” Id. at 925. Courts must now dismiss unexhausted claims as it encounters\nthem and proceed with exhausted claims on a claim-by-claim basis. Id. at 926.\n       The Supreme Court’s ruling does not change the outcome of this case. The\nEighth A mendment claim was the only remaining claim in the suit. Sparks’\nfailure to exhaust this claim ended the matter and the district court appropriately\ndeclined to address the remainder of appellees’ arguments.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fW e deny Sparks’ motion to proceed ifp and order him to immediately remit the\n\nfull amount of the filing fee.

The case is\n\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n      Stephen Sparks, a Colorado state prisoner, brought a 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\naction complaining about the condition of his confinement. Appearing pro se, he\n\nappeals from the district court’s judgment granting defendants’ motions to\n\ndismiss and summary judgment. W e affirm.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n      Sometime in 1995, Sparks claims to have been incorrectly labeled a gang\n\nmember by Lieutenant Foster w hile at the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility.\n\nUpon transfer to the Limon Correctional Facility, Sparks learned he was\n\nconsidered a security threat and classified within a Security Threat Group (STG).\n\nLater, Sparks was moved to the Sterling Correctional Facility. W hile there,\n\nSparks claims to have been told by Lieutenant Hoffman that he was considered a\n\nleading member of a prison gang called “The Family.” W hen Sparks asked if he\n\ncould file a grievance to prove he is not a gang member, Lieutenant Hoffman said\n\nno.\n\n      Sometime later, Sparks also claims: Captain Nycz at the Sterling\n\nCorrectional Facility forced him to cross a prisoner strike to work in the kitchen\n\ndespite inmate threats to any prisoner who crossed the line; he was selected based\n\non his STG classification and because the prison officials intended to use his\n\nleadership role within the prison population to diffuse the volatile situation;\n\n                                          -2-\n\fLieutenant M agelson of the Sterling Correctional Facility threatened him with\n\nadministrative segregation if he refused the assignment; and the assignment put\n\nhim in charge of other inmates and forced him to do the guard’s job. Sparks\n\nbelieves being labeled a member of “The Family” by prison officials and being\n\nforced to cross the strike line placed his life in danger with rival gangs.\n\n      On October 17, 2003, while still housed at the Sterling Correctional\n\nFacility, Sparks filed an amended complaint against Lieutenant Foster of the\n\nArkansas Valley Correctional Facility; Lieutenants Smelzer and Strode of the\n\nLimon Correctional Facility; and Lieutenants H offman, M agelson and Captain\n\nNycz of the Sterling Correctional Facility. Sparks asserted the defendants\n\nviolated his: (1) Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, (2)\n\nSixth Amendment right to confrontation and (3) Eighth Amendment right to be\n\nfree of cruel and unusual punishment. He sought monetary damages and\n\ninjunctive relief to require prison authorities to establish a procedure for prisoners\n\nto challenge gang or STG classification and to have his name removed from the\n\nSTG list.\n\n      Sparks’ Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment claims rested on the same\n\nfactual assertions. He claimed the defendants denied him the equal protections of\n\nlife and liberty by falsely accusing him of being a gang member without due\n\nprocess of law and the unwarranted label of being a gang member of “The\n\nFamily” constitutes cruel and unusual punishment because it put his life in danger\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwith rival gangs. Further, he claims Nycz, Hoffman and M agelson placed his life\n\nin danger w hen they forced him to cross a prisoner work strike in the facility\n\nkitchen at Sterling Correctional Facility, knowing of threats made against anyone\n\nwho crossed the picket line. Sparks’ Sixth Amendment right to confrontation\n\nclaim was based on the fact he was unable to present witnesses to disprove any\n\ngang affiliation.\n\n      A. M otion To D ismiss\n\n      On M arch 4, 2004, defendants filed a motion to dismiss Sparks’ claims.\n\nThe matter was referred to a magistrate judge who issued a Recommendation for\n\nPartial Dismissal on December 2, 2004. Sparks filed an objection to the\n\nmagistrate’s Recommendation on January 6, 2005. Based in part on the\n\nmagistrate judge’s recommendations, on February 2, 2005, the district judge\n\ndismissed Sparks’ Fourteenth Amendment claim with prejudice because the\n\nColorado prison rules and regulations do not create a liberty interest in not being\n\nlabeled a gang member. The district judge also dismissed Sparks’ Sixth\n\nAmendment claim with prejudice, reasoning the Sixth Amendment only applies to\n\ncriminal proceedings and the gang classification is not a criminal proceeding.\n\nThe district court did not dismiss the Eighth Amendment claim.\n\n      The district judge concluded Sparks’ allegations were sufficient to raise a\n\nquestion whether the defendants deliberately exposed Sparks to harm at the hands\n\nof other inmates. Addressing Sparks’ Eighth Amendment claim against the\n\n                                         -4-\n\fdefendants in their official capacities, it determined the Eleventh Amendment\n\nprecluded Sparks’ claim for monetary damages. Although Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity does not apply to injunctive relief, the district court held injunctive\n\nrelief was moot as to all defendants except Foster, the only defendant currently\n\nemployed at the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility. 1\n\n      As to the Eighth Amendment claims against defendants in their individual\n\ncapacities, the district court denied the motion to dismiss because Sparks had\n\nsufficiently pled an Eighth Amendment claim to warrant monetary damages under\n\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).\n\n      B. M otion for Summary Judgment\n\n      After the district court ruled on the M otion to Dismiss, defendants filed a\n\nM otion for Summary Judgment. Among other arguments, the defendants asserted\n\nSparks failed to exhaust available administrative remedies under the PLRA, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1997e(a) by failing to use the administrative grievance process. Sparks\n\nfiled a “M otion to Deny Defendant(s) M otion for Summary Judgment” and\n\nincluded affidavits regarding the merits of his claims, but did not address the\n\nissue of exhaustion. The summary judgment motion was referred to the\n\nmagistrate judge who recommended defendants’ motion be granted in part and the\n\n      1\n         Prior to the district judge’s ruling, Sparks was transferred back to the\nArkansas V alley Correctional Facility. Contrary to the ruling, however,\nLieutenant Foster left his position at the Arkansas V alley Correctional Facility to\nbecome an STG coordinator at the Colorado State Penitentiary several years prior\nto this complaint being filed.\n\n                                         -5-\n\flaw suit dismissed without prejudice in its entirety based upon Sparks’ failure to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies. Sparks filed an objection to the magistrate\n\njudge’s recommendation on December 20, 2005. In it, Sparks claimed for the\n\nfirst time “[a] trial would reveal through records held by the defendants that the\n\nPlaintiff did attempt to exhaust administrative remedies, by requesting from\n\nfacility chain of command, starting with Plaintiffs’ Case M anager Olsen, to Head\n\nCase M anager Clarkson, and assistant W arden Soares, a grievance on the issue of\n\nbeing forced to work in a hostile area, as a tool to defuse a facility uprising.” (R.\n\nVol. I, Doc. 77 at 2.) Sparks further asserted that once the authorities declined to\n\nissue a grievance the issue was ended.\n\n      On February 21, 2006, the district court ruled on the defendants’ M otion\n\nfor Summary Judgment after considering the magistrate judge’s recommendations.\n\nThe district judge deemed Sparks’ objections to the magistrate’s recommendation\n\nas timely and conducted a de novo review of his objections. The district court\n\ngranted the summary judgment motion and dismissed Sparks’ Eighth Amendment\n\nclaims without prejudice because Sparks failed to prove he exhausted the\n\navailable administrative remedies. A separate judgment dismissing Sparks’\n\ncomplaint with prejudice was entered on February 22, 2006, which incorporated\n\nboth the order granting partial dismissal and the order granting summary\n\njudgment for the defendants.\n\n      Sparks filed a notice of appeal and motion to proceed in form a pauperis\n\n                                          -6-\n\f(ifp) on M arch 22, 2006. The district court denied Sparks’ motion to proceed ifp\n\non April 17, 2006. It determined, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3), the appeal\n\nwas not taken in good faith because Sparks did not show the existence of a\n\nreasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues\n\nraised on appeal. Sparks renew ed his ifp application with this Court and\n\nconsented to the disbursement of partial payments from his prison account toward\n\nthe filing fee.\n\n                                    II. Discussion\n\n       A. Fourteenth and Sixth Amendment Claims\n\n       W e review the district court’s dismissal of Sparks’ claims de novo pursuant\n\nto Rule 12(b)(6), accepting all well-pleaded allegations as true and viewing them\n\nin the light most favorable to Sparks.

During the pendency of this appeal, the Supreme Court issued Jones v.\n\nBock, wherein it determined “that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense\n\nunder the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specifically plead or\n\ndemonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

They then noted Sparks alleged he could not\n\nfile a grievance for classification issues but he made no such allegation with\n\n                                         -10-\n\fregard to the violation of his Eighth Amendment rights in association with his\n\ntemporary job assignment in the facility kitchen. Therefore, they contend Sparks’\n\nclaim should be dismissed because he failed to exhaust his remedies. 2\n\n      In his response, Sparks did not mention the exhaustion argument. Although\n\nhe attached two sworn affidavits he authored and numerous grievances, none of\n\nthe materials referenced his Eighth Amendment claim. Rather, he apparently\n\nrelied on his amended complaint, wherein he checked a box indicating he\n\nexhausted the available administrative remedies and explained a prisoner’s\n\nclassification cannot be complained of in the prison system, thus he is allowed to\n\nseek direct relief in court. However, in objection to the magistrate’s\n\nrecommendation for summary judgment based on exhaustion, Sparks claimed he\n\nattempted to exhaust administrative remedies but w as denied the opportunity.\n\nThis was the first time Sparks responded to the failure to exhaust claim.\n\n      In granting the summary judgment motion, the district court determined\n\nthat Sparks failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies for his Eighth\n\nAmendment claim. The district court determined Sparks’ request for a review of\n\n\n\n      2\n        The appellees never filed an answer to Sparks’ complaint or raised the\nissue of exhaustion in their M otion to D ismiss.

See Colorado Department of Corrections, Admin. Reg. No. 850-04\n\n(A ugust 1, 2003) (“This grievance procedure may not be used to seek review of . .\n\n. classification . . . . Classification is entirely at the discretion of the\n\nadministrative head and classification committee of each institution.”). 3 He now\n\nfurther asserts his case manager determined, because the classification comm ittee\n\nplaced him in the facility kitchen during the prison uprising, his grievance w as a\n\nclassification issue and not subject to review through the grievance procedures.\n\nIn his reply brief, Sparks alleges he requested a grievance on the issue, but his\n\ncase manager directly prevented him from filing grievances.\n\n       Other circuits have held that administrative remedies are not “available”\n\nwhen prison officials refuse to provide prisoners with grievance forms. See\n\n       3\n         Other portions of this regulation have been amended since Sparks filed his\ncomplaint. The amended regulation provides the same prohibition on filing\nclassification grievances with a different indexing format. See Colorado\nDepartment of Corrections, Admin. Reg.

Thus, Sparks’ claim the administrative procedures w ere\n\nfutile does not excuse a lack of exhaustion.

The Supreme Court specifically rejected this rule in Jones v.\nBock. 127 S.Ct. at 923-26. In addition to declaring PLRA exhaustion an\naffirmative defense, the Supreme Court determined the total exhaustion rule does\nnot “comport with the purpose of the PLRA to reduce the quantity of inmate\nsuits.” Id. at 925. Courts must now dismiss unexhausted claims as it encounters\nthem and proceed with exhausted claims on a claim-by-claim basis.
