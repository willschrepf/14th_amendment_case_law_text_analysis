Introduction\n\n      Appellant Ricky Derzapf (Ricky) appeals the order granting Connie\n\nJohnson‘s (Connie) petition for grandparent visitation with Ricky‘s children. In\n\nseven issues, Ricky contends that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding visitation to Connie because Connie does not have standing, the trial\n\ncourt‘s judgment violates the law of the case, insufficient evidence supports the\n\njudgment, and the court-appointed expert‘s testimony should have been\n\nexcluded. Ricky also seeks remand for reconsideration of his attorney‘s fees.\n\fWe reverse the trial court‘s judgment and remand the case for consideration of\n\nRicky‘s attorney‘s fees.\n\n                                 II. Background\n\nA. General Background and Connie’s Original Suit for Custody\n\n      Ricky and Jennifer Derzapf were married in the mid-1990s and had two\n\nchildren: A.J.D., born in 1996; and J.B.D., born in 2000. B.G.D., born to Jennifer\n\nin 1991, is not Ricky‘s biological son, but Ricky adopted B.G.D. after he married\n\nJennifer.1 Jennifer was diagnosed with leukemia while pregnant with J.B.D. and\n\npassed away on June 3, 2001.\n\n      Connie is Jennifer‘s mother and B.G.D., A.J.D., and J.B.D.‘s grandmother.\n\nFor several months immediately following Jennifer‘s death, Connie and her\n\nhusband, Randy Johnson, served as the children‘s primary caregivers. Ricky\n\nand the Johnsons initially worked cooperatively on the children‘s behalf, but\n\ntension between Ricky and the Johnsons increased once Ricky began\n\nreasserting himself as the children‘s primary caregiver. The Johnsons perceived\n\nRicky as emotionally distant, and Ricky believed Connie was directly\n\nundermining his influence and authority over the children and assuming the role\n\nof mother instead of grandmother.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Although Connie originally sought court-ordered grandparent visitation\nwith B.G.D. when she filed this suit in 2004, visitation with B.G.D. is no longer at\nissue because B.G.D. became legally emancipated the week before trial.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      On May 6, 2003, Connie and Randy filed an original suit affecting the\n\nparent-child relationship (SAPCR) seeking custody of the children and requesting\n\nthat they be appointed sole managing conservators, and they obtained an ex\n\nparte temporary restraining order preventing Ricky from having possession of the\n\nchildren. Attached to the Johnsons‘ original petition were affidavits by Connie,\n\nRandy, and Connie‘s three sons. The Johnsons alleged in their petition and\n\naffidavits that Ricky endangered the children (particularly B.G.D.) and\n\nsignificantly impaired the children‘s physical health and emotional development.\n\nThe affidavits also contained many critical assessments of Ricky‘s fitness as a\n\nparent and husband and included allegations of physical and verbal abuse. For\n\nexample, Connie stated in her affidavit that Jennifer‘s stress from living with\n\nRicky caused her immune system to ―crash,‖ ending her sixteen-month battle\n\nwith leukemia. After a hearing, the trial court dissolved the temporary restraining\n\norder, returned the children to Ricky‘s conservatorship, and dismissed the case\n\nwithout prejudice.   Ricky then cut the children off from any contact with the\n\nJohnsons.\n\nB. 2005 Temporary Grandparent Visitation Order\n\n      Connie and Randy filed this lawsuit, a petition for grandparent access, on\n\nMarch 10, 2004. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.433 (West Supp. 2010). In\n\nOctober 2005, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the Johnsons‘\n\nrequest for a temporary order for grandparent visitation. Dr. Mark R. Otis, the\n\ncourt-appointed psychologist, testified at the temporary orders hearing that\n\n\n                                        3\n\fRicky‘s decision to cut off the Johnsons‘ access to the children was justified\n\nunder the circumstances and that Ricky was understandably devastated, hurt,\n\nangry, and offended by the Johnsons‘ allegations. Indeed, Dr. Otis wrote in his\n\n2005 report that ―Connie contributed significantly more to the atmosphere of\n\nmistrust and hurt than Ricky or Randy.‖\n\n      Dr. Otis also observed in his 2005 report that, in the months following the\n\noriginal lawsuit and while the Johnsons did not have access to the children, Ricky\n\nhad taken the children to a counselor; that B.G.D. and A.J.D. were prescribed\n\nanti-depressant medication; that the children‘s pediatrician concurred with\n\nRicky‘s conclusion that further contact with the Johnsons would be harmful to the\n\nchildren‘s   emotional   well-being;   that   the   children   showed   ―significant\n\nimprovement‖ in their ―adjustment and personal well-being‖; that B.G.D. and\n\nA.J.D. were taken off the anti-depressants; that the children were released from\n\ncounseling; and that ―collateral sources‖ had confirmed the children‘s\n\nimprovement.\n\n      Despite the statements in his report, Dr. Otis also testified at the temporary\n\norders hearing that the children were ―clearly distraught‖ about losing their\n\nrelationship with the Johnsons; that it makes A.J.D. sad to think about the\n\nJohnsons; that A.J.D. ―potentially might have some difficulties down the line‖; that\n\nA.J.D. and B.G.D. talk about the Johnsons ―with a lingering kind of sadness, a\n\nyearning‖; and that cutting the children off from the Johnsons ―would not be\n\nhealthy,‖ would be harmful to their long-term psychological development, and\n\n\n                                          4\n\fcould cause them to be ―emotionally damaged.‖ But Dr. Otis also testified that\n\nthe children‘s sadness had ―not manifested as depression or behavioral problems\n\nor acting out‖ and that ―sadness and yearning doesn‘t rise to a level of significant\n\nemotional impairment.‖ Dr. Otis recommended that the children‘s visitation with\n\nthe Johnsons begin in stages, first with Randy, then with the children‘s uncles,\n\nand later with Connie after she and her family attended counseling. After the\n\nhearing, the trial court signed an order granting the Johnsons visitation on the\n\nfirst Saturday of each month.\n\n      The children had visitations with the Johnsons for the next sixteen months.\n\nRicky acknowledged that the visits went well. His only complaints were that the\n\nJohnsons‘ gifts were a ―little excessive‖ and that the Johnsons had allowed\n\nB.G.D. to take his girlfriend to the lake with them, but he admitted that the\n\nJohnsons were not aware that B.G.D. had been grounded at the time from\n\nseeing his girlfriend.\n\nC. Ricky’s Petition for Writ of Mandamus\n\n      Ricky sought mandamus relief after the trial court entered the temporary\n\norder granting grandparent visitation with the children. Although this court denied\n\nRicky‘s petition, the supreme court granted it. See In re Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d\n\n327, 331 (Tex. 2007) (orig. proceeding). The supreme court held that Randy did\n\nnot have standing as a step-grandparent to seek grandparent access and that\n\nConnie had not met her statutory burden of proving that the children‘s physical\n\nhealth or emotional well-being would be significantly impaired in the absence of\n\n\n                                         5\n\fvisitation with her. Id. at 332–33, 333–34. After the supreme court‘s decision in\n\nMarch 2007, Ricky again denied the Johnsons any access to or visitation with the\n\nchildren outside of five meals and the children‘s extracurricular activities, which\n\nthe Johnsons only learned of by communicating with B.G.D.\n\nD. Trial on the Merits\n\n      The case proceeded in the trial court after the supreme court‘s decision.\n\nFor his part, Dr. Otis conducted a separate telephone interview with Ricky and\n\nConnie and two interviews with the children. He also conducted what he termed\n\n―collateral interviews‖ with Randy, Dr. Connell, Barbara Lyne (mother of one of\n\nB.G.D.‘s friends), Sherry Cantu (friend of the Johnson family), and Sherri Booker\n\n(friend of Ricky and the children). Dr. Otis then issued an updated report dated\n\nSeptember 8, 2008. Final trial on the merits before the court began on April 6,\n\n2009, and the trial court heard testimony from seven fact witnesses and two\n\nexpert witnesses.2\n\n      Ricky testified that his attitude toward Connie had not changed since 2005,\n\nthat he was not bitter toward Connie, and that he was concerned that her past\n\nalienating behavior would continue in the future. He also testified that Connie‘s\n\naffidavit in support of the 2003 SAPCR suit (filed by Connie and Randy for sole\n\ncustody of the children) was very destructive and caused a lot of his concern and\n\nmistrust.\n\n\n      2\n       Ricky‘s attorney also testified concerning Ricky‘s attorney‘s fees.\n\n\n                                         6\n\f      Ricky also testified about the children‘s demeanor and improvement in\n\n2003 and 2004 when they did not have contact with the Johnsons. The children\n\nspent almost a month in Houston with Ricky‘s sister-in-law and later started\n\ncounseling, and B.G.D. and A.J.D. were initially prescribed anti-depressants.\n\nRicky testified that he did not notice any problems with the children between\n\n2003 when they stopped seeing the Johnsons and 2005 when the court-ordered\n\nvisitations began and that the children were ―very good, very well stabilized.‖ He\n\nsaid that the children had very positive demeanors and that he did not observe\n\nthe kids mourning or grieving.\n\n      Ricky testified that he and the children moved from Wichita Falls to\n\nBurkburnett in early 2007 because he could no longer afford the children‘s\n\nprivate school and because he had good friends in Burkburnett who could help\n\nhim with the children. He said A.J.D. and J.B.D. play sports all year, that J.B.D.\n\nhad been involved in dancing and singing activities, and that he had not\n\nobserved any behavior in either child that caused him concern about their\n\nemotional states. Ricky testified that he had discussed the children‘s mother with\n\nthem almost weekly; that he had talked with them regularly about what they were\n\ndoing with school, sports, and their friends; and that he had shown them physical\n\naffection. He testified that J.B.D. was doing well in school and generally makes\n\nfriends in any social situation. He also testified that A.J.D. is typically slower to\n\nmake friends but that A.J.D. had surprisingly made friends in Burkburnett almost\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fimmediately, and Ricky denied seeing the sadness, longing, and frustration in\n\nA.J.D. that Dr. Otis had reported.\n\n       Ricky admitted that his relationship with B.G.D. was somewhat different\n\nthan his relationship with A.J.D. and J.B.D., but he denied treating B.G.D.\n\ndifferently.   He agreed that his relationship with B.G.D. had become\n\nprogressively worse, but he said that it began deteriorating before the court-\n\nordered visitations stopped in March 2007.      B.G.D. had started talking about\n\nleaving home and had exhibited more defiant behavior about breaking Ricky‘s\n\nrules, and Ricky testified that B.G.D. had said he would move to Connie‘s and\n\nthat he and Connie had been planning the move for a long time.\n\n       Ricky agreed that Connie is an important person in A.J.D. and J.B.D.‘s life\n\nand that the Johnsons provided them emotional nurturing, but he denied that\n\nConnie is a core relation for either of them. He testified that he believes he is\n\nemotionally connected with his children, that he does not believe they mourn the\n\nloss of contact with the Johnsons or yearn for more contact, and that he feels it is\n\nin A.J.D. and J.B.D.‘s best interest for him to be present at any visitations with\n\nthe Johnsons.      Ricky also testified that Dr. Otis‘s graduated visitation\n\nrecommendation was not in the children‘s best interest.\n\n       Ricky also denied that he had cut off all visitations with the Johnsons and\n\ntestified that the children had been with them at five dinners and at as many as\n\nforty extracurricular activities over a two-year period. Ricky said that he was not\n\ncomfortable with gifts the Johnsons had given the children but that he tried not to\n\n\n                                         8\n\fshow any negativity.     He denied that he intended to discontinue all contact\n\nbetween the children and the Johnsons if not court-ordered.\n\n      Connie testified that Jennifer and B.G.D. lived with her before Jennifer and\n\nRicky were married and that B.G.D. saw her every day during that time. She\n\ntestified that she is emotionally bonded with all of the children. She said that she\n\nprovided the children with emotional support when they lived with her following\n\nJennifer‘s death and that Ricky had initially supported her role with the children.\n\nConnie also testified about the conflict that arose when Ricky decided that the\n\nchildren should live with him full time beginning in January 2003 and said that\n\nRicky stonewalled her efforts to see the kids after that time and that Ricky had\n\nnot voluntarily allowed her any access to the children between May 2003 and\n\nMarch 2004.\n\n      Connie testified that she had worked very hard since 2005 to avoid even\n\nthe appearance of impropriety. She said she wanted Ricky ―to understand that\n\nthose kids love both of us‖ and that she ―want[ed] to let those kids love both of us\n\nbecause that‘s what‘s in their best interest.‖ Connie described the court-ordered\n\nvisitations and testified that they went very well, that she reconnected with the\n\nchildren, that it was nurturing for the children to have the visitations, and that the\n\nchildren see her as someone with whom it is safe to talk about their mother. She\n\ntestified that she was very concerned that Ricky did not recognize the emotions\n\nthat the children reported to Dr. Otis, that Ricky did not encourage the children to\n\nbe their own person or to express their feelings, and that she believed she could\n\n\n                                          9\n\fprovide the children with emotional support. However, Connie agreed that A.J.D.\n\nand J.B.D. were ―bonded and feel comfortable‖ with Ricky. Even so, she testified\n\nthat she believed the children‘s emotional well-being would be significantly\n\nimpaired if visitations with her were not resumed.\n\n      On cross-examination, Connie agreed that her 2003 affidavit was hurtful\n\nand damaging, but she testified that she stood by the statements in the affidavit\n\nand that ―facts don‘t change.‖ She also admitted telling B.G.D. in a 2003 letter\n\nthat he could divorce his father.         And although she admitted that Ricky\n\nadequately fed, clothed, and sheltered the children, she testified that Ricky was\n\nnot a fit parent because he did not emotionally nurture the children. Finally,\n\nalthough Connie testified that she wanted court-ordered visitation with the\n\nchildren, she also testified that she just wanted to be a grandparent and enjoy\n\nher grandchildren ―like [her] friends get to enjoy theirs.‖\n\n      Dr. Mary Connell is a forensic and clinical psychologist who has studied\n\nalienating behaviors and had worked with Connie since late 2004.             She\n\ndescribed parental alienation as someone trying to turn a child against a parent,\n\nand she testified that she had worked with Connie to give her insight into her\n\ntendency toward alienation and to help her learn to interact with Ricky and the\n\nchildren in a positive and respectful manner.\n\n      Dr. Connell described Connie as ―quite humbled‖ in 2004 and testified that\n\nConnie understood the egregious and destructive nature of her past behavior.\n\nDr. Connell testified that Connie had ―absolutely succeeded in eradicating the\n\n\n                                          10\n\falienating language from her behavior and the impulses to alienate.‖ She said\n\nthat Connie‘s first reflex was now ―generally neutral to positive on Ricky.‖ Based\n\nprimarily on information relayed to her by Connie, Dr. Connell testified that\n\nConnie nurtured the children‘s emotional needs during the court-ordered\n\nvisitations and that Connie provided J.B.D. specifically with a same-sex role\n\nmodel and a person who could provide information about her mother. Although\n\nDr. Connell testified that Connie had ―been an exemplar for positive work in . . .\n\neradicating those [alienating] behaviors,‖ she also agreed that the recidivism rate\n\nfor persons exhibiting alienating behavior is quite strong 3 and that most of\n\nConnie‘s underlying perceptions of Ricky remain negative.\n\n      B.G.D. testified that his petition for emancipation was granted a week\n\nbefore trial. He said that emancipation was his idea and that he had heard about\n\nthe concept years earlier from a girl at his school. He described living with Ricky\n\nas ―pretty bad‖ and said that he was depressed, wanted to be left alone, and did\n\nnot want to associate with anyone.     B.G.D. testified that his relationship with\n\nRicky had always been ―emotionally distant,‖ that he felt Ricky had treated him as\n\na child Ricky was forced to take care of, that Ricky‘s relationship with A.J.D. was\n\ndifferent, and that Ricky had never put his arms around him and said that he\n\nloved him. B.G.D. admitted on cross-examination, however, that Ricky had put\n\nhis arms around him and said that he loved him and that Ricky taught him to\n\n      3\n        Dr. Connell testified at the 2005 temporary orders hearing that parental\nalienation is intractable and ―a very difficult phenomenon to treat.‖\n\n\n                                        11\n\fshoot a gun; worked with him to install speakers in his car; took him hunting; and\n\nwas there when he shot his first deer and first and second turkeys. 4 B.G.D.\n\ndenied being manipulated or influenced by Connie to move into her home, but he\n\nadmitted that Connie bought him a one-year-old Mustang convertible within two\n\nweeks of moving into her house and that, unlike Ricky, Connie allowed him to\n\nhave earrings and wear his hair long.5\n\n      B.G.D. also testified that he had ―disowned‖ Ricky, that he no longer\n\nconsidered Ricky his father, and that he planned to change his name to McAffey\n\n(his mother‘s maiden name). B.G.D. also admitted telling Dr. Otis that ―the rebel\n\nwould come and go‖ in him and that he believed Ricky‘s rules, such as curfew\n\nand not being home with his girlfriend when Ricky was not present, were\n\nunreasonable.    Finally, B.G.D. admitted swinging at and choking Ricky in\n\nJanuary 2008 after Ricky had grounded him from seeing a new girlfriend.\n\n      Randy testified that when B.G.D. moved into their home, he and Connie\n\nalso had problems with B.G.D. following their rules. Randy said that he and\n\nConnie discussed the matter with B.G.D. and that after several months, B.G.D.\n\n      4\n       Dr. Otis testified that B.G.D.‘s description of his relationship with Ricky\nwas not entirely accurate; B.G.D.‘s relationship with Connie predated Ricky‘s,\nand B.G.D. had a different relationship with Ricky than J.B.D. and A.J.D. and was\ndepressed before he moved. However, Dr. Otis believed that B.G.D.‘s trial\ntestimony was an attempt to justify his decisions to seek emancipation and move\ninto Connie‘s home.\n      5\n        Connie denied encouraging or bribing B.G.D. to move into her home and\ntestified that she advised him to think seriously about doing so, but she also told\nB.G.D. that she would not turn him away if he decided to move in with her.\n\n\n                                         12\n\fbegan following their rules and being respectful.     Randy denied that he and\n\nConnie had bribed B.G.D. into coming to live with them and said that he had\n\nrequired B.G.D. to work to earn additional spending money.\n\n      Randy reported positively about the court-ordered visitations and\n\ndescribed how J.B.D. sometimes cried and asked to spend the night when the\n\nvisitations were over. He also testified that the children, when they had seen the\n\nJohnsons at extracurricular activities or the scheduled meal visits, were hesitant\n\nto show a great deal of affection when Ricky was present but that they had acted\n\ndifferently when Ricky was not present.       Randy also testified that he had\n\npromised the children‘s mother that the children would be close to the Johnsons\n\nthroughout their lives, that he believed it was ―terrible‖ that B.G.D. wanted to\n\ndisown Ricky and change his name, but that he believed Ricky was making\n\ndecisions that made him an unfit parent.\n\n      Greg Johnson, the children‘s uncle, testified that he attended each of the\n\nsixteen court-ordered visitations, that the children had loving interactions with\n\nConnie during the visits, that the children were very emotionally bonded with\n\nConnie, and that the children would benefit from seeing Connie.        Greg also\n\ndescribed an incident before Jennifer‘s death in which he believed Ricky played\n\ntoo roughly with B.G.D. and then ridiculed B.G.D. for crying.\n\n      Tammy Derzapf is Ricky‘s sister-in-law. She described Ricky as ―quiet,\n\nkind of introverted, but very loving, a very caring person. Just very genuine.‖\n\nShe also testified that she believed Ricky to be ―very much‖ emotionally in tune\n\n\n                                        13\n\fwith the children‘s feelings and that she had not seen the children exhibit\n\nreluctance to share their feelings with him.\n\n      Tammy testified that the children had extended summertime visits with her\n\nin Houston each year, beginning in 2003 shortly after the Johnsons‘ original\n\nSAPCR filing. Tammy testified that B.G.D. said in 2003 that he did not want to\n\nparticipate in their family prayer before dinner because he did not want to go\n\nagainst Connie‘s wishes. In 2004, Tammy observed that the kids were happy\n\nand that B.G.D. was not as mean to A.J.D. as he had been in 2003. Tammy\n\ntestified that the children‘s demeanor was also good in 2005 and that they did not\n\nseem to be sad, depressed, grieving, or mourning, but she said that ―something\n\nhad changed‖ in 2006. A.J.D. and J.B.D. were doing well in 2006, but she said\n\nthat B.G.D. was not happy, was very mean to A.J.D., and was confused and\n\ndistrustful. In 2008, only A.J.D. and J.B.D. visited, and Tammy observed that\n\nA.J.D. was more relaxed than he had been in a long time and made friends with\n\nseveral neighborhood kids.\n\n      Steve Booker is an attorney in Burkburnett, and he and his wife Sherry are\n\nRicky‘s close friends. Steve and Sherry had seen Ricky and the children two to\n\nthree times per week during at least the previous year. Steve described A.J.D.\n\nas quiet but ―all boy,‖ and he testified that A.J.D. had ―a bunch of friends‖ that\n\noften visited him at Ricky‘s house. He described J.B.D. as a ―pistol‖ and ―happy\n\ngo lucky‖ and said she always wanted to be the center of attention.         Steve\n\ntestified that he had not seen the children exhibit any lingering sadness,\n\n\n                                         14\n\fdepression, or frustration and that he perceived Ricky as sensitive to the\n\nchildren‘s emotional needs.\n\n      Dr. Otis testified that Ricky was resentful of and did not trust Connie, that\n\nConnie was no longer bitter at Ricky and was managing her past alienating\n\nbehavior, and that the children had observed her changed attitude. Dr. Otis\n\ntestified that the children renewed their attachments to the Johnsons during the\n\ncourt-ordered visitations, but he said that the current level of contact was not\n\nmeeting their emotional needs. Dr. Otis testified that A.J.D. in particular ―yearns‖\n\nfor more contact with the Johnsons, that A.J.D. would feel ―deep disappointment‖\n\nif not allowed to see the Johnsons regularly, that A.J.D. ―grieves‖ not seeing\n\nthem, and that A.J.D.‘s deep disappointment could ―potentially manifest itself into\n\npotential depression‖ and could ―potentially manifest itself in anger at Ricky.‖ He\n\ntestified that there was a ―high probability‖ that denying A.J.D. visitation with\n\nConnie would significantly impair A.J.D.‘s emotional well-being, but he also said\n\nthat A.J.D. was ―very bonded‖ with Ricky, was not affected by Ricky‘s negativity\n\ntoward Connie, and did not want anything to interfere with his living with Ricky.\n\n      Dr. Otis described J.B.D. as very social, extroverted, affectionate, and\n\nforthcoming, and he testified that she ―gets a great deal of social support just\n\nabout everywhere she turns.‖ He said that J.B.D.‘s level of distress was ―much\n\nless‖ than A.J.D.‘s and that there was ―some probability‖ of significant impairment\n\nto J.B.D.‘s emotional well-being in the absence of visitation with Connie. Dr. Otis\n\nacknowledged, however, that he could not isolate Connie from the rest of her\n\n\n                                        15\n\ffamily and say that significant impairment to the children‘s emotional well-being\n\nwould occur just because of a denial of visitation with Connie. Finally, Dr. Otis\n\nrecommended in his 2008 report that ―putting controls in place, such as the\n\n[graduated visitation schedule he] recommended in the initial evaluation would be\n\nhelpful and important.‖\n\nE. Trial Court Orders Grandparent Visitation\n\n      After trial, the trial court signed a judgment ordering grandparent visitation\n\nwith Connie on the third Saturday of each month and denying Ricky‘s request for\n\nattorney‘s fees. Connie submitted 107 findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nthat the trial court signed without revision or modification.6 This appeal followed.\n\n                            III. Connie Has Standing\n\n      Ricky contends in his second issue that Connie does not have standing to\n\nseek grandparent access ―because she failed to meet an express element of\n\nsection 153.433 of the Texas Family Code.‖          See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §\n\n153.433. Specifically, Ricky argues that the denial of possession or access is an\n\nexpress element of a grandparent‘s claim for possession or access under section\n\n153.433 and that there is no evidence that the children were cut off from Connie.\n\n\n      6\n       We have reviewed each of the trial court‘s findings of fact and note that\nmany are not supported by any evidence in the record. See generally McGalliard\nv. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 696 (Tex. 1986) (stating that unchallenged\nfindings of fact ―are binding on an appellate court unless the contrary is\nestablished as a matter of law, or if there is no evidence to support the finding‖);\nRischon Dev. Corp. v. City of Keller, 242 S.W.3d 161, 166 (Tex. App.CFort Worth\n2007, pet. denied), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 501 (2008) (same).\n\n\n                                         16\n\f      Although we agree that the denial of possession of or access to the child is\n\nan express element a grandparent must prove to obtain access pursuant to\n\nsection 153.433, see In re J.M.T., 280 S.W.3d 490, 493 (Tex. App.—Eastland\n\n2009, no pet.), a grandparent‘s standing is not conferred by section 153.433.\n\nRather, a grandparent‘s standing to seek possession or access to a child is\n\nconferred by section 153.432.     In re Smith, 260 S.W.3d 568, 572–73 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, orig. proceeding); see Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §\n\n153.432 (West Supp. 2010). ―Although a successful access suit might require\n\nthe grandparent to satisfy section 153.433, whether the grandparent ultimately\n\nwill succeed is a different question than whether the grandparent has the right\n\nsimply to bring suit.‖ Smith, 260 S.W.3d at 573. Section 153.432(a) provides\n\nthat ―a biological or adoptive grandparent may request possession of or access\n\nto a grandchild by filing: (1) an original suit; or (2) a suit for modification as\n\nprovided by [family code] chapter 156.‖ Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.432(a). It is\n\nundisputed that Connie is the biological grandmother of the children.          She\n\ntherefore has standing pursuant to section 153.432 to seek possession of or\n\naccess to the children, and we overrule Ricky‘s second issue. See id.; Smith,\n\n260 S.W.3d at 572–73.\n\n                           IV. Significant Impairment\n\n      Ricky contends in his first issue that the trial court violated the law of the\n\ncase because ―virtually nothing has changed‖ since the supreme court granted\n\nhis petition for a writ of mandamus. Specifically, Ricky argues that although Dr.\n\n\n                                        17\n\fOtis modified his testimony by ―attempting to use the magic buzz words,‖ Dr.\n\nOtis‘s underlying observations and conclusions ―have not changed at all.‖\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n      1. Texas Family Code Section 153.433(a)\n\n      ―The Legislature set a high threshold for a grandparent to overcome the\n\npresumption that a fit parent acts in his children‘s best interest: the grandparent\n\nmust prove [by a preponderance of the evidence] that denial of access would\n\n‗significantly impair‘ the children's physical health or emotional well-being.‖\n\nDerzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 334 (citing Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.433(a)(2)). This\n\nhigh threshold exists so that a court will refrain from interfering with child-rearing\n\ndecisions made by a parent simply because the court believes that a ―better\n\ndecision‖ could have been made. See id. at 334 (quoting Troxel v. Granville, 530\n\nU.S. 57, 73, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 2064 (2000)). This standard recognizes that ―so\n\nlong as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will\n\nnormally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the\n\nfamily.‖ Id. at 333 (quoting In re Mays-Hooper, 189 S.W.3d 777, 778 (Tex. 2006)\n\n(orig. proceeding)).\n\n      We review a trial court‘s decision to grant a grandparent‘s request for\n\naccess or possession for an abuse of discretion. In re Chambless, 257 S.W.3d\n\n698, 699 (Tex. 2008); Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 333.           A trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion if it grants access to grandchildren when the grandparent has not\n\nproven that denying the grandparent access to the child would significantly impair\n\n\n                                         18\n\fthe child‘s physical health or emotional well-being. In re Scheller, 325 S.W.3d\n\n640, 643 (Tex. 2010) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 333).\n\nThis is so because ―a trial court has no discretion in determining what the law is\n\nor applying the law to the facts, even when the law is unsettled.‖ Derzapf, 219\n\nS.W.3d at 333 (quoting In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135\n\n(Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding)).\n\n      2. Law of the Case\n\n      ―The ‗law of the case‘ doctrine is defined as that principle under which\n\nquestions of law decided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case\n\nthroughout its subsequent stages.‖     Loram Maint. of Way, Inc. v. Ianni, 210\n\nS.W.3d 593, 596 (Tex. 2006) (quoting Hudson v. Wakefield, 711 S.W.2d 628,\n\n630 (Tex. 1986)). The doctrine may be applied when an issue has been resolved\n\non the merits in a prior mandamus proceeding. See In re Cantu de Villarreal,\n\n330 S.W.3d 11, 20–21 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2010, no pet.) (holding law of\n\nthe case doctrine prevented reconsideration of issue decided in earlier\n\nmandamus petition); Landerman v. State Bar of Tex., 247 S.W.3d 426, 433 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied) (stating ―[r]eview of a trial court‘s action under\n\nthe abuse of discretion standard is a question of law‖); see also In re A.T.M., No.\n\n12-07-00243-CV, 2009 WL 1492832, at *3 (Tex. App.—Tyler May 29, 2009, pet.\n\ndenied) (mem. op.) (stating prior holding as to whether abuse of discretion\n\noccurred was question of law, noting facts previously presented were\n\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\f―substantially the same,‖ and holding prior mandamus denial was law of the\n\ncase).\n\n         ―By narrowing the issues in successive stages of the litigation, the law of\n\nthe case doctrine is intended to achieve uniformity of decision as well as judicial\n\neconomy and efficiency. The doctrine is based on public policy and is aimed at\n\nputting an end to litigation.‖ Briscoe v. Goodmark Corp., 102 S.W.3d 714, 716\n\n(Tex. 2003) (quoting Hudson, 711 S.W.2d at 630). The doctrine applies only to\n\nquestions of law rather than questions of fact, and it ―does not necessarily apply\n\nwhen either the issues or the facts presented at successive appeals are not\n\nsubstantially the same as those involved on the first trial.‖ Hudson, 711 S.W.2d\n\nat 630. Indeed, the decision to revisit a previous holding is left to the discretion\n\nof the court under the particular circumstances of each case. City of Houston v.\n\nJackson, 192 S.W.3d 764, 769 (Tex. 2006). In other words, a reviewing court\n\nmay apply the law of the case doctrine in a subsequent proceeding if the facts in\n\nthe later proceeding are ―so nearly the same [as the earlier proceeding] that they\n\ndo not materially affect the legal issues involved in the later proceeding.‖\n\nLawrence v. City of Wichita Falls, 122 S.W.3d 322, 326 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n2003, pet. denied).\n\nB. Discussion\n\n         To determine whether we should apply the law of the case doctrine, we\n\nmust compare the evidence from the 2005 temporary orders hearing (upon which\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\fthe supreme court granted Ricky‘s petition for a writ of mandamus) and the\n\nevidence from the 2009 trial on the merits.\n\n      1. Dr. Otis’s 2005 Testimony\n\n      Dr. Otis testified in 2005 that Ricky had legitimate reasons to be concerned\n\nabout Connie‘s influence over the children and that he had appropriately cut off\n\nthe children‘s contact with Connie. Discussing the Johnsons‘ allegations in their\n\n2003 SAPCR suit, Dr. Otis testified that he did not believe the accusations to be\n\ntrue and that Ricky was justifiably devastated, hurt, angry, and offended. Dr. Otis\n\nagreed that he had not seen any evidence that Ricky was an unfit parent or had\n\nprovided the children with an unsafe environment.\n\n      Dr. Otis described J.B.D., five years old at the time, as very outgoing,\n\nanimated, enjoyable, loving, and ―just a delight.‖ He said that she had never met\n\na stranger, loved being the center of attention, ―connect[ed] extremely well,‖ and\n\nwas ―very attached to her brothers and to her father.‖\n\n      Dr. Otis testified that the children, particularly B.G.D. and A.J.D., were\n\n―clearly distraught‖ about the loss of their relationship with the Johnsons and that\n\nA.J.D. was ―the one that potentially might have some difficulties down the line.‖\n\nHe said A.J.D. ―had the most emotional reaction during the [joint] session with\n\nthe Johnsons in terms of being tearful and a little bit distraught.‖ Dr. Otis testified\n\nthat A.J.D. and B.G.D. had a ―lingering sadness‖ about the lack of contact with\n\nthe Johnsons, and he said that they talked about their grandparents ―with a\n\nlingering kind of sadness, a yearning.‖ But Dr. Otis also said that the sadness\n\n\n                                          21\n\fhad ―not manifested as depression or behavioral problems or acting out,‖ and he\n\nagreed that ―sadness and yearning doesn‘t rise to a level of significant emotional\n\nimpairment.‖\n\n      Dr. Otis also testified that the Johnsons had a great deal to offer the\n\nchildren, including a connection to their deceased mother and a sense of loving\n\nstimulation, belonging, family, warmth, and security.       He testified that the\n\nJohnsons ―have had important attachments to the children,‖ that it ―would not be\n\nhealthy to cut them off,‖ that it would be harmful to the children‘s long-term\n\npsychological development, and that the children would be ―emotionally\n\ndamaged‖ if visitations with the Johnsons were not resumed.               Dr. Otis\n\nrecommended that the children first renew contact with Randy and their uncles\n\nand that Connie be integrated into the visitation plan after counseling. Dr. Otis\n\ndid not recommend renewed contact with Connie alone.\n\n      After the temporary orders hearing, the trial court granted the Johnsons‘\n\nrequest for visitation with the children.\n\n      2. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Opinion\n\n      The supreme court granted Ricky‘s petition for a writ of mandamus and\n\nheld that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering grandparent visitation.\n\nSee Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 331. The supreme court held that Connie was\n\nrequired to ―overcome the statutory presumption that denying the children access\n\nto her in particular—not Connie and Randy jointly or the Johnson family as a\n\nwhole—would significantly impair the children‘s physical health or emotional well-\n\n\n                                            22\n\fbeing,‖ and the court noted that Dr. Otis‘s testimony related to a denial of access\n\nto both her and Randy or to the Johnson family as a whole and ―d[id] not support\n\nrenewed contact with Connie alone.‖ Id. at 333. The court also mentioned Dr.\n\nOtis‘s observation of lingering sadness and stated that ―[w]hile it is true that Dr.\n\nOtis believed the children would benefit from renewed contact with the Johnson\n\nfamily, he did not testify that denying Connie access to her grandchildren would\n\nsignificantly impair the children‘s physical or emotional health.‖      Id.   Thus,\n\nalthough Dr. Otis testified that the children experienced lingering sadness and\n\nyearning due to the loss of contact with the Johnsons, that the children would be\n\nemotionally damaged without access, and that denying access to the Johnsons\n\nwould be harmful to the children‘s long-term psychological development, the\n\nsupreme court held that Connie had not met her burden of proving that denying\n\nher access to the children would significantly impair their physical health or\n\nemotional well-being. Id. at 334.\n\n      3. Dr. Otis’s 2009 Testimony\n\n      Subsequent to the supreme court‘s grant of mandamus relief in March\n\n2007, Dr. Otis conducted separate telephone interviews with Ricky and Connie,\n\nand he interviewed the children once as a group and once separately.7 Dr. Otis\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        Dr. Otis did not serve as the children‘s counselor in any capacity, and he\ndid not see or talk to them in the nearly three years since preparing his initial\nreport.\n\n\n                                        23\n\falso interviewed the mother of one of B.G.D.‘s friends, a friend of the Johnson\n\nfamily, and one of Ricky‘s friends.\n\n      Dr. Otis testified at trial that the children renewed their attachments to\n\nConnie and the Johnsons during the court-ordered visitations and that the\n\nchildren felt comfortable, accepted, and part of the family. He further opined that\n\nthe current level of contact was not meeting A.J.D.‘s and J.B.D.‘s emotional\n\nneeds. Dr. Otis testified that A.J.D. ―yearns‖ for more contact with the Johnsons\n\nand strongly wanted more contact. A.J.D. told Dr. Otis that he felt mad, sad, and\n\nhopeless about not being able to see the Johnsons, and Dr. Otis opined that\n\nA.J.D. would feel ―deep disappointment‖ if he could not see the Johnsons\n\nregularly and that it was important for A.J.D. to have resumed visitation. He said\n\nthat A.J.D.‘s deep disappointment could ―potentially manifest itself into potential\n\ndepression‖ and could ―potentially manifest itself in anger at Ricky,‖ that A.J.D.\n\n―grieves‖ not seeing the Johnsons, that being cut off from the Johnsons is an\n\naspect to the grief and loss of his mother, and that A.J.D.‘s feelings of\n\nhopelessness and despair ―could‖ affect his well-being. After further questioning,\n\nDr. Otis testified that there is a ―high probability‖ that denying A.J.D. visitation\n\nwith Connie would significantly impair A.J.D.‘s emotional well-being. However,\n\nDr. Otis testified that A.J.D. did not want anything to interfere with his living with\n\nRicky, that A.J.D. was not affected by any negativity Ricky feels toward Connie,\n\nand that there was ―no question‖ that A.J.D. was ―very bonded with his father.‖\n\nDr. Otis concluded his 2008 report by stating that if visitations are not resumed,\n\n\n                                         24\n\f―the children, particularly A.J.D., may benefit from psychotherapy to help them\n\nwork through their feelings of frustration and grief.‖\n\n      Discussing J.B.D., Dr. Otis said that she experienced the visitations with\n\nthe Johnsons very positively. However, he testified that J.B.D.‘s level of distress\n\nwas ―much less‖ than A.J.D.‘s and that there was ―some probability‖ that denying\n\nJ.B.D. visitation with Connie would significantly impair her emotional well-being.\n\nDr. Otis described J.B.D. as very social, extroverted, affectionate, and\n\nforthcoming and said she ―gets a great deal of social support just about\n\neverywhere she turns.‖\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Otis agreed that the children had exhibited\n\nsignificant improvement when they had no access to the Johnsons. Dr. Otis also\n\nagreed that, as of the time of his 2008 report and although they again had little\n\ncontact with the Johnsons, A.J.D. and J.B.D. liked their new schools, were\n\ndeveloping rewarding friendships, and were doing well academically. In fact, Dr.\n\nOtis admitted that A.J.D. and J.B.D. were in good medical health and achieving\n\n―in spite of‖ their infrequent contact with B.G.D. and the Johnsons. Dr. Otis also\n\nacknowledged the possibility that Connie could impose onto A.J.D. and J.B.D.\n\nthe type of negative influence she had previously imposed onto B.G.D., and Dr.\n\nOtis testified that the possible negative influence from Connie should be a matter\n\nof concern to Ricky.\n\n      Moreover, Dr. Otis testified that A.J.D. did not list Connie as being within\n\nhis ―core group‖ of relationships, instead listing only Ricky, B.G.D., and one of his\n\n\n                                          25\n\funcles. J.B.D. listed Connie in her core group, but she also listed Ricky; each of\n\nher aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents; and Ricky‘s friends Sherri and Steve\n\nBooker. In fact, Dr. Otis acknowledged that he could not isolate Connie from the\n\nrest of her family and say that significant impairment to the children‘s emotional\n\nwell-being would occur just because of a denial of visitation with Connie. Finally,\n\nDr. Otis again recommended a graduated visitation schedule that integrated\n\nConnie after initial visitation with Randy and the children‘s uncles.\n\n      4. The Law of This Case\n\n      In its 2007 opinion granting mandamus relief from the 2005 temporary\n\nvisitation order, the supreme court held that Connie is required to prove that\n\ndenying access to her alone, as opposed to her and the rest of her family, would\n\nsignificantly impair the children‘s emotional well-being. Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at\n\n333. The supreme court then stated with respect to Dr. Otis‘s 2005 report and\n\ntestimony at the temporary orders hearing:\n\n            While it is true that Dr. Otis believed the children would benefit\n      from renewed contact with the Johnson family, he did not testify that\n      denying Connie access to her grandchildren would significantly\n      impair the children‘s physical or emotional health. Dr. Otis’s\n      testimony pertained either to both Connie and Randy or to the\n      Johnson family as a whole, but his recommendations do not support\n      renewed contact with Connie alone. To the contrary, Dr. Otis noted\n      that Ricky had a reasonable interest in preserving ―the children‘s\n      hard-won feelings of peace and security‖ regained after contact with\n      Connie ceased.\n\n             Dr. Otis‘s report concluded that the children should first have\n      renewed contact with Randy, then with the Uncles and extended\n      family, and only later with Connie. Dr. Otis testified that his\n      recommendation ―was based on the strength that [he] perceived that\n\n\n                                         26\n\f      the grandfather, Randy has.‖ In fact, Dr. Otis testified that he could\n      not recommend visitation with Connie, absent supervision, as\n      Connie‘s problems controlling her impulses could be ―very influential‖\n      and detrimental to the children.\n\n             And while Dr. Otis testified that it may be harmful for Ricky to\n      cut off the Johnsons’ access to B.G.D. in particular and that it was in\n      the children’s best interest that they have some contact with their\n      grandparents, his testimony does not support awarding Connie\n      access over Ricky’s objection. According to Dr. Otis, ―[t]he manner\n      in which she resisted the children transitioning to [Ricky‘s] full-time\n      care interfered with the children‘s emotional and behavioral\n      adjustment.‖ He also concluded that Connie actively attempted to\n      alienate B.G.D. from his father and that her behavior was ―very\n      damaging‖ to the parent-child relationship. Moreover, while Dr. Otis\n      noted the children’s “sadness” at being unable to see their\n      grandparents, he admitted that these feelings did not rise to the level\n      of a significant emotional impairment.\n\nId. at 333–34 (emphasis added). The court then held that Connie had failed to\n\nmeet the ―high threshold‖ required by section 153.433(a)(2) for obtaining access\n\nto the children over Ricky‘s objection. Id. at 334.\n\n      5. Dr. Otis’s Observations Did Not Change\n\n      There is no substantive difference between Dr. Otis‘s 2005 and 2009\n\ntestimony. Dr. Otis did not state in his 2008 report that A.J.D. or J.B.D. might\n\nsuffer significant emotional impairment from a denial of visitation with Connie,\n\nstating instead that A.J.D. and J.B.D. ―are at risk to experience more\n\npsychological harm if they are cut off from further involvement with Connie and\n\nthe Johnson family than if they have contact.‖ And although Dr. Otis changed his\n\nultimate conclusion in 2009 (while testifying at trial in response to questions by\n\nConnie‘s lawyer) to a ―high probability‖ of significant emotional impairment for\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\fA.J.D. and ―some probability‖ of significant emotional impairment for J.B.D., the\n\nobservations underlying his 2005 and 2009 opinions were no different. In both\n\ninstances, Dr. Otis described the benefits the children gained from access to the\n\nJohnsons and the lingering sadness, yearning, and grief the children would\n\nexperience in the absence of visitations. The supreme court has already held in\n\nthis case that lingering sadness, yearning, and grief from the lack of access\n\ncoupled with the inability to segregate Connie from her family and the benefits\n\ngained from access do not rise to the level of significant emotional impairment\n\nrequired by section 153.433. See Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 333–34; see also\n\nScheller, 325 S.W.3d at 643–44 (holding trial court abused its discretion by\n\nissuing temporary order for grandparent visitation even though the grandchildren\n\nhad displayed anger, had experienced isolated bed wetting and nightmares, and\n\nhad suffered the impact of losing their mother).\n\n      6. Connie’s Arguments\n\n      Connie argues that the law of the case doctrine does not apply because\n\nthe supreme court addressed a question of fact, not a question of law, when it\n\nheld that the trial court abused its discretion by entering the temporary order. We\n\ndisagree because ―[r]eview of a trial court‘s action under the abuse of discretion\n\nstandard is a question of law.‖ Landerman, 247 S.W.3d at 433 (citing El Dorado\n\nMotors, Inc. v. Koch, 168 S.W.3d 360, 368 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.);\n\nsee In re A.T.M., 2009 WL 1492832, at *3 (stating that prior holding as to\n\nwhether abuse of discretion occurred was a question of law).\n\n\n                                        28\n\f      Connie also argues that the issues now presented are not identical to\n\nthose determined by the supreme court because the supreme court addressed\n\nwhether Randy had standing and ―whether the evidence presented at the\n\ntemporary hearing in 200[5] showing that the denial of access to both\n\ngrandparents would significantly impair the children‘s emotional well-being was\n\nalso sufficient to show significant impairment as to Connie alone.‖ Again, we\n\ndisagree. The supreme court addressed the issue of whether the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by awarding grandparent access, and it held that Randy did\n\nnot have standing and that Connie had not overcome the presumption that a fit\n\nparent acts in his children‘s best interest by proving that denial of access would\n\nsignificantly impair the children‘s physical health or emotional well-being.\n\nDerzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 332–34.         The question presented in this appeal is\n\nlikewise whether the trial court abused its discretion by awarding visitation to\n\nConnie when she allegedly failed to overcome the presumption that a fit parent\n\nacts in his children‘s best interest by proving that denial of access would\n\nsignificantly impair the children‘s emotional well-being. Thus, we cannot agree\n\nthat the issue now presented differs to such an extent from that in the mandamus\n\nproceeding to make the law of the case doctrine inapplicable.\n\n      Finally, Connie argues that the facts at trial are ―dramatically different‖ than\n\nthose at the time of the temporary orders hearing. She first points to Dr. Otis‘s\n\ntrial testimony and opinions, but we have already discussed the striking\n\nsimilarities in Dr. Otis‘s testimony from the temporary orders hearing and the trial\n\n\n                                         29\n\fand need not repeat them here. Connie also points to Ricky‘s alleged ―extreme‖\n\nalienation of B.G.D.    But Ricky‘s and Connie‘s respective relationships with\n\nB.G.D. are indisputably different than Ricky‘s and Connie‘s respective\n\nrelationships with A.J.D. and J.B.D., and they were indisputably different at the\n\ntime of the temporary orders hearing.\n\n      First, Dr. Otis testified that B.G.D.‘s description of his strained and\n\nemotionally distant relationship with Ricky was not entirely accurate because\n\nB.G.D. was attempting to justify his decision to emancipate and move into\n\nConnie‘s home.       Moreover, Dr. Otis testified that B.G.D.‘s and A.J.D.‘s\n\nexperiences are not equivalent. In fact, Dr. Otis was impressed by A.J.D.‘s ability\n\nto think for himself, to have his own point of view, and to not be affected by\n\nRicky‘s negative feelings about Connie or B.G.D.‘s negative feelings about Ricky;\n\nand he offered a similar opinion of J.B.D.‘s objective view of the conflict between\n\nRicky and the Johnsons. More importantly, Dr. Otis testified that there was more\n\ngoing on with B.G.D. than either Ricky or Connie understood. Dr. Otis described\n\nB.G.D.‘s condition as the ―sleeper effect‖ and explained that his recent\n\nexperience with girlfriends had activated his feelings of loss of his mother in a\n\nway that B.G.D. did not understand and that caused an ―almost panicky\n\ndesperate yearning for that kind of relatedness that he had with his mother at one\n\ntime and ha[d] lost.‖ Dr. Otis testified that A.J.D.‘s and J.B.D.‘s relationships with\n\nRicky are ―far different‖ than B.G.D.‘s, saying that A.J.D. and J.B.D. are ―very\n\nsecurely attached to their dad. They love him dearly. They don‘t ever want that\n\n\n                                         30\n\fto be jeopardized. They feel very secure living with him in relation to him. They\n\ndon‘t share the animosity or the oppositionality or the resentment that [B.G.D.]\n\nexperiences toward his dad.‖ Finally, grandparent visitation with B.G.D. is not at\n\nissue in this appeal. Thus, B.G.D.‘s situation is not comparable to A.J.D.‘s or\n\nJ.B.D.‘s, and we are not convinced that B.G.D.‘s changed relationship with Ricky\n\nsufficiently altered the factual landscape of this case to make the law of the case\n\ndoctrine inapplicable, particularly when Dr. Otis used identical terms to describe\n\nA.J.D.‘s and J.B.D.‘s emotional states both before and after B.G.D.‘s relationship\n\nwith Ricky changed.\n\n      7. The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion\n\n      The circumstances of this case are unfortunate, as are the circumstances\n\nin many grandparent-access cases. As Justice Kennedy wrote in his dissent in\n\nTroxel,\n\n      It must be recognized, of course, that a domestic relations\n      proceeding in and of itself can constitute state intervention that is so\n      disruptive of the parent-child relationship that the constitutional right\n      of a custodial parent to make certain basic determinations for the\n      child‘s welfare becomes implicated . . . . If a single parent who is\n      struggling to raise a child is faced with visitation demands from a\n      third party, the attorney‘s fees alone might destroy [the parent‘s]\n      hopes and plans for the child‘s future. Our system must confront\n      more often the reality that litigation can itself be so disruptive that\n      constitutional protection may be required; and I do not discount the\n      possibility that in some instances the best interests of the child\n      standard may provide insufficient protection to the parent-child\n      relationship. We owe it to the Nation‘s domestic relations structure,\n      however, to proceed with caution.\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\f530 U.S. at 101, 120 S. Ct. at 2079 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). While Justice\n\nKennedy was responding to whether something more than a best-interests\n\nstandard should govern third-party access suits, Justice Kennedy‘s observations\n\nare especially poignant, particularly in cases like this one.\n\n      Ricky is a single parent who, by all accounts, adequately feeds, clothes,\n\nand shelters his children, and his fitness as a parent is demonstrated by A.J.D.‘s\n\nand J.B.D.‘s significant emotional and social improvement in the years following\n\ntheir mother‘s death. Of course, Connie and her family believe, with support from\n\nDr. Otis, that Ricky could outwardly exhibit more emotion when interacting with\n\nhis children, but courts must tread lightly when interfering with a fit parent‘s\n\ndecision to limit his children‘s access to their extended family.        As Justice\n\nO‘Connor wrote for the plurality in Troxel, ―In an ideal world, parents might\n\nalways seek to cultivate the bonds             between grandparents and their\n\ngrandchildren. Needless to say, however, our world is far from perfect, and in it\n\nthe decision whether such an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial in\n\nany specific case is for the parent to make in the first instance.‖ Id. at 70, 120 S.\n\nCt. at 2062.\n\n      Because our state supreme court previously held that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by ordering grandparent visitation to Connie based on\n\ntestimony by Dr. Otis that does not substantively differ from Dr. Otis‘s trial\n\ntestimony, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by granting, over\n\nRicky‘s objection, Connie‘s petition for grandparent visitation. See Scheller, 325\n\n\n                                         32\n\fS.W.3d at 643–44; Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 334. We therefore sustain Ricky‘s\n\nfirst issue.8\n\n                               IV. Attorney’s Fees\n\n       In his seventh issue, Ricky asks that we remand the case to the trial court\n\nfor further consideration of his request for attorney‘s fees.         ―The award of\n\nattorney's fees in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship is within the trial\n\ncourt‘s discretion.‖ Bruni v. Bruni, 924 S.W.2d 366, 368 (Tex. 1996); see Tex.\n\nFam. Code Ann. § 106.002(a) (West 2008). Given our disposition of Ricky‘s first\n\nissue, Ricky is now the prevailing party in this litigation. Although Ricky‘s status\n\nas the prevailing party is only one consideration in the trial court‘s exercise of\n\ndiscretion when deciding whether to award him attorney‘s fees, remand for\n\nreconsideration of the recoverability of Ricky‘s fees is appropriate. We therefore\n\nsustain Ricky‘s seventh issue and remand this case to the trial court so that the\n\ntrial court may reconsider whether Ricky should recover attorney‘s fees from\n\nConnie. See Bruni, 924 S.W.2d at 368–69 (remanding case to permit trial court\n\nto reconsider attorney‘s fee award in light of decision on appeal).\n\n\n\n\n       8\n       Given our disposition of Ricky‘s first issue, we do not reach his third\nthrough sixth issues. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1 (requiring appellate court to\naddress ―every issue raised and necessary to final disposition of the appeal‖).\n\n\n                                         33\n\f                                 V. Conclusion\n\n      Having overruled Ricky‘s second issue; having sustained his first and\n\nseventh issues; and having not reached his third, fourth, fifth, or sixth issues, we\n\nreverse the trial court‘s judgment and remand this case to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    ANNE GARDNER\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: GARDNER, WALKER, and MCCOY, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: August 25, 2011\n\n\n\n\n                                        34\n\f",

Introduction\n\n      Appellant Ricky Derzapf (Ricky) appeals the order granting Connie\n\nJohnson‘s (Connie) petition for grandparent visitation with Ricky‘s children. In\n\nseven issues, Ricky contends that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding visitation to Connie because Connie does not have standing, the trial\n\ncourt‘s judgment violates the law of the case, insufficient evidence supports the\n\njudgment, and the court-appointed expert‘s testimony should have been\n\nexcluded. Ricky also seeks remand for reconsideration of his attorney‘s fees.\n\fWe reverse the trial court‘s judgment and remand the case for consideration of\n\nRicky‘s attorney‘s fees.\n\n                                 II. Background\n\nA. General Background and Connie’s Original Suit for Custody\n\n      Ricky and Jennifer Derzapf were married in the mid-1990s and had two\n\nchildren: A.J.D., born in 1996; and J.B.D., born in 2000. B.G.D., born to Jennifer\n\nin 1991, is not Ricky‘s biological son, but Ricky adopted B.G.D. after he married\n\nJennifer.1 Jennifer was diagnosed with leukemia while pregnant with J.B.D. and\n\npassed away on June 3, 2001.\n\n      Connie is Jennifer‘s mother and B.G.D., A.J.D., and J.B.D.‘s grandmother.\n\nFor several months immediately following Jennifer‘s death, Connie and her\n\nhusband, Randy Johnson, served as the children‘s primary caregivers. Ricky\n\nand the Johnsons initially worked cooperatively on the children‘s behalf, but\n\ntension between Ricky and the Johnsons increased once Ricky began\n\nreasserting himself as the children‘s primary caregiver. The Johnsons perceived\n\nRicky as emotionally distant, and Ricky believed Connie was directly\n\nundermining his influence and authority over the children and assuming the role\n\nof mother instead of grandmother.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Although Connie originally sought court-ordered grandparent visitation\nwith B.G.D. when she filed this suit in 2004, visitation with B.G.D. is no longer at\nissue because B.G.D. became legally emancipated the week before trial.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      On May 6, 2003, Connie and Randy filed an original suit affecting the\n\nparent-child relationship (SAPCR) seeking custody of the children and requesting\n\nthat they be appointed sole managing conservators, and they obtained an ex\n\nparte temporary restraining order preventing Ricky from having possession of the\n\nchildren. Attached to the Johnsons‘ original petition were affidavits by Connie,\n\nRandy, and Connie‘s three sons. The Johnsons alleged in their petition and\n\naffidavits that Ricky endangered the children (particularly B.G.D.) and\n\nsignificantly impaired the children‘s physical health and emotional development.\n\nThe affidavits also contained many critical assessments of Ricky‘s fitness as a\n\nparent and husband and included allegations of physical and verbal abuse. For\n\nexample, Connie stated in her affidavit that Jennifer‘s stress from living with\n\nRicky caused her immune system to ―crash,‖ ending her sixteen-month battle\n\nwith leukemia. After a hearing, the trial court dissolved the temporary restraining\n\norder, returned the children to Ricky‘s conservatorship, and dismissed the case\n\nwithout prejudice.   Ricky then cut the children off from any contact with the\n\nJohnsons.\n\nB. 2005 Temporary Grandparent Visitation Order\n\n      Connie and Randy filed this lawsuit, a petition for grandparent access, on\n\nMarch 10, 2004. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.433 (West Supp. 2010). In\n\nOctober 2005, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the Johnsons‘\n\nrequest for a temporary order for grandparent visitation. Dr. Mark R. Otis, the\n\ncourt-appointed psychologist, testified at the temporary orders hearing that\n\n\n                                        3\n\fRicky‘s decision to cut off the Johnsons‘ access to the children was justified\n\nunder the circumstances and that Ricky was understandably devastated, hurt,\n\nangry, and offended by the Johnsons‘ allegations. Indeed, Dr. Otis wrote in his\n\n2005 report that ―Connie contributed significantly more to the atmosphere of\n\nmistrust and hurt than Ricky or Randy.‖\n\n      Dr. Otis also observed in his 2005 report that, in the months following the\n\noriginal lawsuit and while the Johnsons did not have access to the children, Ricky\n\nhad taken the children to a counselor; that B.G.D. and A.J.D. were prescribed\n\nanti-depressant medication; that the children‘s pediatrician concurred with\n\nRicky‘s conclusion that further contact with the Johnsons would be harmful to the\n\nchildren‘s   emotional   well-being;   that   the   children   showed   ―significant\n\nimprovement‖ in their ―adjustment and personal well-being‖; that B.G.D. and\n\nA.J.D. were taken off the anti-depressants; that the children were released from\n\ncounseling; and that ―collateral sources‖ had confirmed the children‘s\n\nimprovement.\n\n      Despite the statements in his report, Dr. Otis also testified at the temporary\n\norders hearing that the children were ―clearly distraught‖ about losing their\n\nrelationship with the Johnsons; that it makes A.J.D. sad to think about the\n\nJohnsons; that A.J.D. ―potentially might have some difficulties down the line‖; that\n\nA.J.D. and B.G.D. talk about the Johnsons ―with a lingering kind of sadness, a\n\nyearning‖; and that cutting the children off from the Johnsons ―would not be\n\nhealthy,‖ would be harmful to their long-term psychological development, and\n\n\n                                          4\n\fcould cause them to be ―emotionally damaged.‖ But Dr. Otis also testified that\n\nthe children‘s sadness had ―not manifested as depression or behavioral problems\n\nor acting out‖ and that ―sadness and yearning doesn‘t rise to a level of significant\n\nemotional impairment.‖ Dr. Otis recommended that the children‘s visitation with\n\nthe Johnsons begin in stages, first with Randy, then with the children‘s uncles,\n\nand later with Connie after she and her family attended counseling. After the\n\nhearing, the trial court signed an order granting the Johnsons visitation on the\n\nfirst Saturday of each month.\n\n      The children had visitations with the Johnsons for the next sixteen months.\n\nRicky acknowledged that the visits went well. His only complaints were that the\n\nJohnsons‘ gifts were a ―little excessive‖ and that the Johnsons had allowed\n\nB.G.D. to take his girlfriend to the lake with them, but he admitted that the\n\nJohnsons were not aware that B.G.D. had been grounded at the time from\n\nseeing his girlfriend.\n\nC. Ricky’s Petition for Writ of Mandamus\n\n      Ricky sought mandamus relief after the trial court entered the temporary\n\norder granting grandparent visitation with the children. Although this court denied\n\nRicky‘s petition, the supreme court granted it. See In re Derzapf, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894839\"><a href=\"/opinion/894839/in-re-derzapf/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331 (Tex. 2007) (orig. proceeding). The supreme court held that Randy did\n\nnot have standing as a step-grandparent to seek grandparent access and that\n\nConnie had not met her statutory burden of proving that the children‘s physical\n\nhealth or emotional well-being would be significantly impaired in the absence of\n\n\n                                         5\n\fvisitation with her. Id. at 332–33, 333–34. After the supreme court‘s decision in\n\nMarch 2007, Ricky again denied the Johnsons any access to or visitation with the\n\nchildren outside of five meals and the children‘s extracurricular activities, which\n\nthe Johnsons only learned of by communicating with B.G.D.\n\nD. Trial on the Merits\n\n      The case proceeded in the trial court after the supreme court‘s decision.\n\nFor his part, Dr. Otis conducted a separate telephone interview with Ricky and\n\nConnie and two interviews with the children. He also conducted what he termed\n\n―collateral interviews‖ with Randy, Dr. Connell, Barbara Lyne (mother of one of\n\nB.G.D.‘s friends), Sherry Cantu (friend of the Johnson family), and Sherri Booker\n\n(friend of Ricky and the children). Dr. Otis then issued an updated report dated\n\nSeptember 8, 2008. Final trial on the merits before the court began on April 6,\n\n2009, and the trial court heard testimony from seven fact witnesses and two\n\nexpert witnesses.2\n\n      Ricky testified that his attitude toward Connie had not changed since 2005,\n\nthat he was not bitter toward Connie, and that he was concerned that her past\n\nalienating behavior would continue in the future. He also testified that Connie‘s\n\naffidavit in support of the 2003 SAPCR suit (filed by Connie and Randy for sole\n\ncustody of the children) was very destructive and caused a lot of his concern and\n\nmistrust.\n\n\n      2\n       Ricky‘s attorney also testified concerning Ricky‘s attorney‘s fees.\n\n\n                                         6\n\f      Ricky also testified about the children‘s demeanor and improvement in\n\n2003 and 2004 when they did not have contact with the Johnsons. The children\n\nspent almost a month in Houston with Ricky‘s sister-in-law and later started\n\ncounseling, and B.G.D. and A.J.D. were initially prescribed anti-depressants.\n\nRicky testified that he did not notice any problems with the children between\n\n2003 when they stopped seeing the Johnsons and 2005 when the court-ordered\n\nvisitations began and that the children were ―very good, very well stabilized.‖ He\n\nsaid that the children had very positive demeanors and that he did not observe\n\nthe kids mourning or grieving.\n\n      Ricky testified that he and the children moved from Wichita Falls to\n\nBurkburnett in early 2007 because he could no longer afford the children‘s\n\nprivate school and because he had good friends in Burkburnett who could help\n\nhim with the children. He said A.J.D. and J.B.D. play sports all year, that J.B.D.\n\nhad been involved in dancing and singing activities, and that he had not\n\nobserved any behavior in either child that caused him concern about their\n\nemotional states. Ricky testified that he had discussed the children‘s mother with\n\nthem almost weekly; that he had talked with them regularly about what they were\n\ndoing with school, sports, and their friends; and that he had shown them physical\n\naffection. He testified that J.B.D. was doing well in school and generally makes\n\nfriends in any social situation. He also testified that A.J.D. is typically slower to\n\nmake friends but that A.J.D. had surprisingly made friends in Burkburnett almost\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fimmediately, and Ricky denied seeing the sadness, longing, and frustration in\n\nA.J.D. that Dr. Otis had reported.\n\n       Ricky admitted that his relationship with B.G.D. was somewhat different\n\nthan his relationship with A.J.D. and J.B.D., but he denied treating B.G.D.\n\ndifferently.   He agreed that his relationship with B.G.D. had become\n\nprogressively worse, but he said that it began deteriorating before the court-\n\nordered visitations stopped in March 2007.      B.G.D. had started talking about\n\nleaving home and had exhibited more defiant behavior about breaking Ricky‘s\n\nrules, and Ricky testified that B.G.D. had said he would move to Connie‘s and\n\nthat he and Connie had been planning the move for a long time.\n\n       Ricky agreed that Connie is an important person in A.J.D. and J.B.D.‘s life\n\nand that the Johnsons provided them emotional nurturing, but he denied that\n\nConnie is a core relation for either of them. He testified that he believes he is\n\nemotionally connected with his children, that he does not believe they mourn the\n\nloss of contact with the Johnsons or yearn for more contact, and that he feels it is\n\nin A.J.D. and J.B.D.‘s best interest for him to be present at any visitations with\n\nthe Johnsons.      Ricky also testified that Dr. Otis‘s graduated visitation\n\nrecommendation was not in the children‘s best interest.\n\n       Ricky also denied that he had cut off all visitations with the Johnsons and\n\ntestified that the children had been with them at five dinners and at as many as\n\nforty extracurricular activities over a two-year period. Ricky said that he was not\n\ncomfortable with gifts the Johnsons had given the children but that he tried not to\n\n\n                                         8\n\fshow any negativity.     He denied that he intended to discontinue all contact\n\nbetween the children and the Johnsons if not court-ordered.\n\n      Connie testified that Jennifer and B.G.D. lived with her before Jennifer and\n\nRicky were married and that B.G.D. saw her every day during that time. She\n\ntestified that she is emotionally bonded with all of the children. She said that she\n\nprovided the children with emotional support when they lived with her following\n\nJennifer‘s death and that Ricky had initially supported her role with the children.\n\nConnie also testified about the conflict that arose when Ricky decided that the\n\nchildren should live with him full time beginning in January 2003 and said that\n\nRicky stonewalled her efforts to see the kids after that time and that Ricky had\n\nnot voluntarily allowed her any access to the children between May 2003 and\n\nMarch 2004.\n\n      Connie testified that she had worked very hard since 2005 to avoid even\n\nthe appearance of impropriety. She said she wanted Ricky ―to understand that\n\nthose kids love both of us‖ and that she ―want[ed] to let those kids love both of us\n\nbecause that‘s what‘s in their best interest.‖ Connie described the court-ordered\n\nvisitations and testified that they went very well, that she reconnected with the\n\nchildren, that it was nurturing for the children to have the visitations, and that the\n\nchildren see her as someone with whom it is safe to talk about their mother. She\n\ntestified that she was very concerned that Ricky did not recognize the emotions\n\nthat the children reported to Dr. Otis, that Ricky did not encourage the children to\n\nbe their own person or to express their feelings, and that she believed she could\n\n\n                                          9\n\fprovide the children with emotional support. However, Connie agreed that A.J.D.\n\nand J.B.D. were ―bonded and feel comfortable‖ with Ricky. Even so, she testified\n\nthat she believed the children‘s emotional well-being would be significantly\n\nimpaired if visitations with her were not resumed.\n\n      On cross-examination, Connie agreed that her 2003 affidavit was hurtful\n\nand damaging, but she testified that she stood by the statements in the affidavit\n\nand that ―facts don‘t change.‖ She also admitted telling B.G.D. in a 2003 letter\n\nthat he could divorce his father.         And although she admitted that Ricky\n\nadequately fed, clothed, and sheltered the children, she testified that Ricky was\n\nnot a fit parent because he did not emotionally nurture the children. Finally,\n\nalthough Connie testified that she wanted court-ordered visitation with the\n\nchildren, she also testified that she just wanted to be a grandparent and enjoy\n\nher grandchildren ―like [her] friends get to enjoy theirs.‖\n\n      Dr. Mary Connell is a forensic and clinical psychologist who has studied\n\nalienating behaviors and had worked with Connie since late 2004.             She\n\ndescribed parental alienation as someone trying to turn a child against a parent,\n\nand she testified that she had worked with Connie to give her insight into her\n\ntendency toward alienation and to help her learn to interact with Ricky and the\n\nchildren in a positive and respectful manner.\n\n      Dr. Connell described Connie as ―quite humbled‖ in 2004 and testified that\n\nConnie understood the egregious and destructive nature of her past behavior.\n\nDr. Connell testified that Connie had ―absolutely succeeded in eradicating the\n\n\n                                          10\n\falienating language from her behavior and the impulses to alienate.‖ She said\n\nthat Connie‘s first reflex was now ―generally neutral to positive on Ricky.‖ Based\n\nprimarily on information relayed to her by Connie, Dr. Connell testified that\n\nConnie nurtured the children‘s emotional needs during the court-ordered\n\nvisitations and that Connie provided J.B.D. specifically with a same-sex role\n\nmodel and a person who could provide information about her mother. Although\n\nDr. Connell testified that Connie had ―been an exemplar for positive work in . . .\n\neradicating those [alienating] behaviors,‖ she also agreed that the recidivism rate\n\nfor persons exhibiting alienating behavior is quite strong 3 and that most of\n\nConnie‘s underlying perceptions of Ricky remain negative.\n\n      B.G.D. testified that his petition for emancipation was granted a week\n\nbefore trial. He said that emancipation was his idea and that he had heard about\n\nthe concept years earlier from a girl at his school. He described living with Ricky\n\nas ―pretty bad‖ and said that he was depressed, wanted to be left alone, and did\n\nnot want to associate with anyone.     B.G.D. testified that his relationship with\n\nRicky had always been ―emotionally distant,‖ that he felt Ricky had treated him as\n\na child Ricky was forced to take care of, that Ricky‘s relationship with A.J.D. was\n\ndifferent, and that Ricky had never put his arms around him and said that he\n\nloved him. B.G.D. admitted on cross-examination, however, that Ricky had put\n\nhis arms around him and said that he loved him and that Ricky taught him to\n\n      3\n        Dr. Connell testified at the 2005 temporary orders hearing that parental\nalienation is intractable and ―a very difficult phenomenon to treat.‖\n\n\n                                        11\n\fshoot a gun; worked with him to install speakers in his car; took him hunting; and\n\nwas there when he shot his first deer and first and second turkeys. 4 B.G.D.\n\ndenied being manipulated or influenced by Connie to move into her home, but he\n\nadmitted that Connie bought him a one-year-old Mustang convertible within two\n\nweeks of moving into her house and that, unlike Ricky, Connie allowed him to\n\nhave earrings and wear his hair long.5\n\n      B.G.D. also testified that he had ―disowned‖ Ricky, that he no longer\n\nconsidered Ricky his father, and that he planned to change his name to McAffey\n\n(his mother‘s maiden name). B.G.D. also admitted telling Dr. Otis that ―the rebel\n\nwould come and go‖ in him and that he believed Ricky‘s rules, such as curfew\n\nand not being home with his girlfriend when Ricky was not present, were\n\nunreasonable.    Finally, B.G.D. admitted swinging at and choking Ricky in\n\nJanuary 2008 after Ricky had grounded him from seeing a new girlfriend.\n\n      Randy testified that when B.G.D. moved into their home, he and Connie\n\nalso had problems with B.G.D. following their rules. Randy said that he and\n\nConnie discussed the matter with B.G.D. and that after several months, B.G.D.\n\n      4\n       Dr. Otis testified that B.G.D.‘s description of his relationship with Ricky\nwas not entirely accurate; B.G.D.‘s relationship with Connie predated Ricky‘s,\nand B.G.D. had a different relationship with Ricky than J.B.D. and A.J.D. and was\ndepressed before he moved. However, Dr. Otis believed that B.G.D.‘s trial\ntestimony was an attempt to justify his decisions to seek emancipation and move\ninto Connie‘s home.\n      5\n        Connie denied encouraging or bribing B.G.D. to move into her home and\ntestified that she advised him to think seriously about doing so, but she also told\nB.G.D. that she would not turn him away if he decided to move in with her.\n\n\n                                         12\n\fbegan following their rules and being respectful.     Randy denied that he and\n\nConnie had bribed B.G.D. into coming to live with them and said that he had\n\nrequired B.G.D. to work to earn additional spending money.\n\n      Randy reported positively about the court-ordered visitations and\n\ndescribed how J.B.D. sometimes cried and asked to spend the night when the\n\nvisitations were over. He also testified that the children, when they had seen the\n\nJohnsons at extracurricular activities or the scheduled meal visits, were hesitant\n\nto show a great deal of affection when Ricky was present but that they had acted\n\ndifferently when Ricky was not present.       Randy also testified that he had\n\npromised the children‘s mother that the children would be close to the Johnsons\n\nthroughout their lives, that he believed it was ―terrible‖ that B.G.D. wanted to\n\ndisown Ricky and change his name, but that he believed Ricky was making\n\ndecisions that made him an unfit parent.\n\n      Greg Johnson, the children‘s uncle, testified that he attended each of the\n\nsixteen court-ordered visitations, that the children had loving interactions with\n\nConnie during the visits, that the children were very emotionally bonded with\n\nConnie, and that the children would benefit from seeing Connie.        Greg also\n\ndescribed an incident before Jennifer‘s death in which he believed Ricky played\n\ntoo roughly with B.G.D. and then ridiculed B.G.D. for crying.\n\n      Tammy Derzapf is Ricky‘s sister-in-law. She described Ricky as ―quiet,\n\nkind of introverted, but very loving, a very caring person. Just very genuine.‖\n\nShe also testified that she believed Ricky to be ―very much‖ emotionally in tune\n\n\n                                        13\n\fwith the children‘s feelings and that she had not seen the children exhibit\n\nreluctance to share their feelings with him.\n\n      Tammy testified that the children had extended summertime visits with her\n\nin Houston each year, beginning in 2003 shortly after the Johnsons‘ original\n\nSAPCR filing. Tammy testified that B.G.D. said in 2003 that he did not want to\n\nparticipate in their family prayer before dinner because he did not want to go\n\nagainst Connie‘s wishes. In 2004, Tammy observed that the kids were happy\n\nand that B.G.D. was not as mean to A.J.D. as he had been in 2003. Tammy\n\ntestified that the children‘s demeanor was also good in 2005 and that they did not\n\nseem to be sad, depressed, grieving, or mourning, but she said that ―something\n\nhad changed‖ in 2006. A.J.D. and J.B.D. were doing well in 2006, but she said\n\nthat B.G.D. was not happy, was very mean to A.J.D., and was confused and\n\ndistrustful. In 2008, only A.J.D. and J.B.D. visited, and Tammy observed that\n\nA.J.D. was more relaxed than he had been in a long time and made friends with\n\nseveral neighborhood kids.\n\n      Steve Booker is an attorney in Burkburnett, and he and his wife Sherry are\n\nRicky‘s close friends. Steve and Sherry had seen Ricky and the children two to\n\nthree times per week during at least the previous year. Steve described A.J.D.\n\nas quiet but ―all boy,‖ and he testified that A.J.D. had ―a bunch of friends‖ that\n\noften visited him at Ricky‘s house. He described J.B.D. as a ―pistol‖ and ―happy\n\ngo lucky‖ and said she always wanted to be the center of attention.         Steve\n\ntestified that he had not seen the children exhibit any lingering sadness,\n\n\n                                         14\n\fdepression, or frustration and that he perceived Ricky as sensitive to the\n\nchildren‘s emotional needs.\n\n      Dr. Otis testified that Ricky was resentful of and did not trust Connie, that\n\nConnie was no longer bitter at Ricky and was managing her past alienating\n\nbehavior, and that the children had observed her changed attitude. Dr. Otis\n\ntestified that the children renewed their attachments to the Johnsons during the\n\ncourt-ordered visitations, but he said that the current level of contact was not\n\nmeeting their emotional needs. Dr. Otis testified that A.J.D. in particular ―yearns‖\n\nfor more contact with the Johnsons, that A.J.D. would feel ―deep disappointment‖\n\nif not allowed to see the Johnsons regularly, that A.J.D. ―grieves‖ not seeing\n\nthem, and that A.J.D.‘s deep disappointment could ―potentially manifest itself into\n\npotential depression‖ and could ―potentially manifest itself in anger at Ricky.‖ He\n\ntestified that there was a ―high probability‖ that denying A.J.D. visitation with\n\nConnie would significantly impair A.J.D.‘s emotional well-being, but he also said\n\nthat A.J.D. was ―very bonded‖ with Ricky, was not affected by Ricky‘s negativity\n\ntoward Connie, and did not want anything to interfere with his living with Ricky.\n\n      Dr. Otis described J.B.D. as very social, extroverted, affectionate, and\n\nforthcoming, and he testified that she ―gets a great deal of social support just\n\nabout everywhere she turns.‖ He said that J.B.D.‘s level of distress was ―much\n\nless‖ than A.J.D.‘s and that there was ―some probability‖ of significant impairment\n\nto J.B.D.‘s emotional well-being in the absence of visitation with Connie. Dr. Otis\n\nacknowledged, however, that he could not isolate Connie from the rest of her\n\n\n                                        15\n\ffamily and say that significant impairment to the children‘s emotional well-being\n\nwould occur just because of a denial of visitation with Connie. Finally, Dr. Otis\n\nrecommended in his 2008 report that ―putting controls in place, such as the\n\n[graduated visitation schedule he] recommended in the initial evaluation would be\n\nhelpful and important.‖\n\nE. Trial Court Orders Grandparent Visitation\n\n      After trial, the trial court signed a judgment ordering grandparent visitation\n\nwith Connie on the third Saturday of each month and denying Ricky‘s request for\n\nattorney‘s fees. Connie submitted 107 findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nthat the trial court signed without revision or modification.6 This appeal followed.\n\n                            III. Connie Has Standing\n\n      Ricky contends in his second issue that Connie does not have standing to\n\nseek grandparent access ―because she failed to meet an express element of\n\nsection 153.433 of the Texas Family Code.‖          See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §\n\n153.433. Specifically, Ricky argues that the denial of possession or access is an\n\nexpress element of a grandparent‘s claim for possession or access under section\n\n153.433 and that there is no evidence that the children were cut off from Connie.\n\n\n      6\n       We have reviewed each of the trial court‘s findings of fact and note that\nmany are not supported by any evidence in the record.

Fam. Code Ann. §\n\n153.432 (West Supp. 2010). ―Although a successful access suit might require\n\nthe grandparent to satisfy section 153.433, whether the grandparent ultimately\n\nwill succeed is a different question than whether the grandparent has the right\n\nsimply to bring suit.‖ Smith, 260 S.W.3d at 573. Section 153.432(a) provides\n\nthat ―a biological or adoptive grandparent may request possession of or access\n\nto a grandchild by filing: (1) an original suit; or (2) a suit for modification as\n\nprovided by [family code] chapter 156.‖ Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.432(a). It is\n\nundisputed that Connie is the biological grandmother of the children.          She\n\ntherefore has standing pursuant to section 153.432 to seek possession of or\n\naccess to the children, and we overrule Ricky‘s second issue. See id.; Smith,\n\n260 S.W.3d at 572–73.\n\n                           IV. Significant Impairment\n\n      Ricky contends in his first issue that the trial court violated the law of the\n\ncase because ―virtually nothing has changed‖ since the supreme court granted\n\nhis petition for a writ of mandamus. Specifically, Ricky argues that although Dr.\n\n\n                                        17\n\fOtis modified his testimony by ―attempting to use the magic buzz words,‖ Dr.\n\nOtis‘s underlying observations and conclusions ―have not changed at all.‖\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n      1. Texas Family Code Section 153.433(a)\n\n      ―The Legislature set a high threshold for a grandparent to overcome the\n\npresumption that a fit parent acts in his children‘s best interest: the grandparent\n\nmust prove [by a preponderance of the evidence] that denial of access would\n\n‗significantly impair‘ the children's physical health or emotional well-being.‖\n\nDerzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 334 (citing Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.433(a)(2)). This\n\nhigh threshold exists so that a court will refrain from interfering with child-rearing\n\ndecisions made by a parent simply because the court believes that a ―better\n\ndecision‖ could have been made.

App.—Fort Worth\n\n2003, pet. denied).\n\nB. Discussion\n\n         To determine whether we should apply the law of the case doctrine, we\n\nmust compare the evidence from the 2005 temporary orders hearing (upon which\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\fthe supreme court granted Ricky‘s petition for a writ of mandamus) and the\n\nevidence from the 2009 trial on the merits.\n\n      1. Dr. Otis’s 2005 Testimony\n\n      Dr. Otis testified in 2005 that Ricky had legitimate reasons to be concerned\n\nabout Connie‘s influence over the children and that he had appropriately cut off\n\nthe children‘s contact with Connie. Discussing the Johnsons‘ allegations in their\n\n2003 SAPCR suit, Dr. Otis testified that he did not believe the accusations to be\n\ntrue and that Ricky was justifiably devastated, hurt, angry, and offended. Dr. Otis\n\nagreed that he had not seen any evidence that Ricky was an unfit parent or had\n\nprovided the children with an unsafe environment.\n\n      Dr. Otis described J.B.D., five years old at the time, as very outgoing,\n\nanimated, enjoyable, loving, and ―just a delight.‖ He said that she had never met\n\na stranger, loved being the center of attention, ―connect[ed] extremely well,‖ and\n\nwas ―very attached to her brothers and to her father.‖\n\n      Dr. Otis testified that the children, particularly B.G.D. and A.J.D., were\n\n―clearly distraught‖ about the loss of their relationship with the Johnsons and that\n\nA.J.D. was ―the one that potentially might have some difficulties down the line.‖\n\nHe said A.J.D. ―had the most emotional reaction during the [joint] session with\n\nthe Johnsons in terms of being tearful and a little bit distraught.‖ Dr. Otis testified\n\nthat A.J.D. and B.G.D. had a ―lingering sadness‖ about the lack of contact with\n\nthe Johnsons, and he said that they talked about their grandparents ―with a\n\nlingering kind of sadness, a yearning.‖ But Dr. Otis also said that the sadness\n\n\n                                          21\n\fhad ―not manifested as depression or behavioral problems or acting out,‖ and he\n\nagreed that ―sadness and yearning doesn‘t rise to a level of significant emotional\n\nimpairment.‖\n\n      Dr. Otis also testified that the Johnsons had a great deal to offer the\n\nchildren, including a connection to their deceased mother and a sense of loving\n\nstimulation, belonging, family, warmth, and security.       He testified that the\n\nJohnsons ―have had important attachments to the children,‖ that it ―would not be\n\nhealthy to cut them off,‖ that it would be harmful to the children‘s long-term\n\npsychological development, and that the children would be ―emotionally\n\ndamaged‖ if visitations with the Johnsons were not resumed.               Dr. Otis\n\nrecommended that the children first renew contact with Randy and their uncles\n\nand that Connie be integrated into the visitation plan after counseling. Dr. Otis\n\ndid not recommend renewed contact with Connie alone.\n\n      After the temporary orders hearing, the trial court granted the Johnsons‘\n\nrequest for visitation with the children.\n\n      2. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Opinion\n\n      The supreme court granted Ricky‘s petition for a writ of mandamus and\n\nheld that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering grandparent visitation.\n\nSee Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 331. The supreme court held that Connie was\n\nrequired to ―overcome the statutory presumption that denying the children access\n\nto her in particular—not Connie and Randy jointly or the Johnson family as a\n\nwhole—would significantly impair the children‘s physical health or emotional well-\n\n\n                                            22\n\fbeing,‖ and the court noted that Dr. Otis‘s testimony related to a denial of access\n\nto both her and Randy or to the Johnson family as a whole and ―d[id] not support\n\nrenewed contact with Connie alone.‖ Id. at 333. The court also mentioned Dr.\n\nOtis‘s observation of lingering sadness and stated that ―[w]hile it is true that Dr.\n\nOtis believed the children would benefit from renewed contact with the Johnson\n\nfamily, he did not testify that denying Connie access to her grandchildren would\n\nsignificantly impair the children‘s physical or emotional health.‖      Id.   Thus,\n\nalthough Dr. Otis testified that the children experienced lingering sadness and\n\nyearning due to the loss of contact with the Johnsons, that the children would be\n\nemotionally damaged without access, and that denying access to the Johnsons\n\nwould be harmful to the children‘s long-term psychological development, the\n\nsupreme court held that Connie had not met her burden of proving that denying\n\nher access to the children would significantly impair their physical health or\n\nemotional well-being. Id. at 334.\n\n      3. Dr. Otis’s 2009 Testimony\n\n      Subsequent to the supreme court‘s grant of mandamus relief in March\n\n2007, Dr. Otis conducted separate telephone interviews with Ricky and Connie,\n\nand he interviewed the children once as a group and once separately.7 Dr. Otis\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        Dr. Otis did not serve as the children‘s counselor in any capacity, and he\ndid not see or talk to them in the nearly three years since preparing his initial\nreport.\n\n\n                                        23\n\falso interviewed the mother of one of B.G.D.‘s friends, a friend of the Johnson\n\nfamily, and one of Ricky‘s friends.\n\n      Dr. Otis testified at trial that the children renewed their attachments to\n\nConnie and the Johnsons during the court-ordered visitations and that the\n\nchildren felt comfortable, accepted, and part of the family. He further opined that\n\nthe current level of contact was not meeting A.J.D.‘s and J.B.D.‘s emotional\n\nneeds. Dr. Otis testified that A.J.D. ―yearns‖ for more contact with the Johnsons\n\nand strongly wanted more contact. A.J.D. told Dr. Otis that he felt mad, sad, and\n\nhopeless about not being able to see the Johnsons, and Dr. Otis opined that\n\nA.J.D. would feel ―deep disappointment‖ if he could not see the Johnsons\n\nregularly and that it was important for A.J.D. to have resumed visitation. He said\n\nthat A.J.D.‘s deep disappointment could ―potentially manifest itself into potential\n\ndepression‖ and could ―potentially manifest itself in anger at Ricky,‖ that A.J.D.\n\n―grieves‖ not seeing the Johnsons, that being cut off from the Johnsons is an\n\naspect to the grief and loss of his mother, and that A.J.D.‘s feelings of\n\nhopelessness and despair ―could‖ affect his well-being. After further questioning,\n\nDr. Otis testified that there is a ―high probability‖ that denying A.J.D. visitation\n\nwith Connie would significantly impair A.J.D.‘s emotional well-being. However,\n\nDr. Otis testified that A.J.D. did not want anything to interfere with his living with\n\nRicky, that A.J.D. was not affected by any negativity Ricky feels toward Connie,\n\nand that there was ―no question‖ that A.J.D. was ―very bonded with his father.‖\n\nDr. Otis concluded his 2008 report by stating that if visitations are not resumed,\n\n\n                                         24\n\f―the children, particularly A.J.D., may benefit from psychotherapy to help them\n\nwork through their feelings of frustration and grief.‖\n\n      Discussing J.B.D., Dr. Otis said that she experienced the visitations with\n\nthe Johnsons very positively. However, he testified that J.B.D.‘s level of distress\n\nwas ―much less‖ than A.J.D.‘s and that there was ―some probability‖ that denying\n\nJ.B.D. visitation with Connie would significantly impair her emotional well-being.\n\nDr. Otis described J.B.D. as very social, extroverted, affectionate, and\n\nforthcoming and said she ―gets a great deal of social support just about\n\neverywhere she turns.‖\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Otis agreed that the children had exhibited\n\nsignificant improvement when they had no access to the Johnsons. Dr. Otis also\n\nagreed that, as of the time of his 2008 report and although they again had little\n\ncontact with the Johnsons, A.J.D. and J.B.D. liked their new schools, were\n\ndeveloping rewarding friendships, and were doing well academically. In fact, Dr.\n\nOtis admitted that A.J.D. and J.B.D. were in good medical health and achieving\n\n―in spite of‖ their infrequent contact with B.G.D. and the Johnsons. Dr. Otis also\n\nacknowledged the possibility that Connie could impose onto A.J.D. and J.B.D.\n\nthe type of negative influence she had previously imposed onto B.G.D., and Dr.\n\nOtis testified that the possible negative influence from Connie should be a matter\n\nof concern to Ricky.\n\n      Moreover, Dr. Otis testified that A.J.D. did not list Connie as being within\n\nhis ―core group‖ of relationships, instead listing only Ricky, B.G.D., and one of his\n\n\n                                          25\n\funcles. J.B.D. listed Connie in her core group, but she also listed Ricky; each of\n\nher aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents; and Ricky‘s friends Sherri and Steve\n\nBooker. In fact, Dr. Otis acknowledged that he could not isolate Connie from the\n\nrest of her family and say that significant impairment to the children‘s emotional\n\nwell-being would occur just because of a denial of visitation with Connie. Finally,\n\nDr. Otis again recommended a graduated visitation schedule that integrated\n\nConnie after initial visitation with Randy and the children‘s uncles.\n\n      4. The Law of This Case\n\n      In its 2007 opinion granting mandamus relief from the 2005 temporary\n\nvisitation order, the supreme court held that Connie is required to prove that\n\ndenying access to her alone, as opposed to her and the rest of her family, would\n\nsignificantly impair the children‘s emotional well-being. Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at\n\n333. The supreme court then stated with respect to Dr. Otis‘s 2005 report and\n\ntestimony at the temporary orders hearing:\n\n            While it is true that Dr. Otis believed the children would benefit\n      from renewed contact with the Johnson family, he did not testify that\n      denying Connie access to her grandchildren would significantly\n      impair the children‘s physical or emotional health. Dr. Otis’s\n      testimony pertained either to both Connie and Randy or to the\n      Johnson family as a whole, but his recommendations do not support\n      renewed contact with Connie alone. To the contrary, Dr. Otis noted\n      that Ricky had a reasonable interest in preserving ―the children‘s\n      hard-won feelings of peace and security‖ regained after contact with\n      Connie ceased.\n\n             Dr. Otis‘s report concluded that the children should first have\n      renewed contact with Randy, then with the Uncles and extended\n      family, and only later with Connie. Dr. Otis testified that his\n      recommendation ―was based on the strength that [he] perceived that\n\n\n                                         26\n\f      the grandfather, Randy has.‖ In fact, Dr. Otis testified that he could\n      not recommend visitation with Connie, absent supervision, as\n      Connie‘s problems controlling her impulses could be ―very influential‖\n      and detrimental to the children.\n\n             And while Dr. Otis testified that it may be harmful for Ricky to\n      cut off the Johnsons’ access to B.G.D. in particular and that it was in\n      the children’s best interest that they have some contact with their\n      grandparents, his testimony does not support awarding Connie\n      access over Ricky’s objection. According to Dr. Otis, ―[t]he manner\n      in which she resisted the children transitioning to [Ricky‘s] full-time\n      care interfered with the children‘s emotional and behavioral\n      adjustment.‖ He also concluded that Connie actively attempted to\n      alienate B.G.D. from his father and that her behavior was ―very\n      damaging‖ to the parent-child relationship. Moreover, while Dr. Otis\n      noted the children’s “sadness” at being unable to see their\n      grandparents, he admitted that these feelings did not rise to the level\n      of a significant emotional impairment.\n\nId. at 333–34 (emphasis added). The court then held that Connie had failed to\n\nmeet the ―high threshold‖ required by section 153.433(a)(2) for obtaining access\n\nto the children over Ricky‘s objection. Id. at 334.\n\n      5. Dr. Otis’s Observations Did Not Change\n\n      There is no substantive difference between Dr. Otis‘s 2005 and 2009\n\ntestimony. Dr. Otis did not state in his 2008 report that A.J.D. or J.B.D. might\n\nsuffer significant emotional impairment from a denial of visitation with Connie,\n\nstating instead that A.J.D. and J.B.D. ―are at risk to experience more\n\npsychological harm if they are cut off from further involvement with Connie and\n\nthe Johnson family than if they have contact.‖ And although Dr. Otis changed his\n\nultimate conclusion in 2009 (while testifying at trial in response to questions by\n\nConnie‘s lawyer) to a ―high probability‖ of significant emotional impairment for\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\fA.J.D. and ―some probability‖ of significant emotional impairment for J.B.D., the\n\nobservations underlying his 2005 and 2009 opinions were no different. In both\n\ninstances, Dr. Otis described the benefits the children gained from access to the\n\nJohnsons and the lingering sadness, yearning, and grief the children would\n\nexperience in the absence of visitations. The supreme court has already held in\n\nthis case that lingering sadness, yearning, and grief from the lack of access\n\ncoupled with the inability to segregate Connie from her family and the benefits\n\ngained from access do not rise to the level of significant emotional impairment\n\nrequired by section 153.433. See Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 333–34; see also\n\nScheller, 325 S.W.3d at 643–44 (holding trial court abused its discretion by\n\nissuing temporary order for grandparent visitation even though the grandchildren\n\nhad displayed anger, had experienced isolated bed wetting and nightmares, and\n\nhad suffered the impact of losing their mother).\n\n      6. Connie’s Arguments\n\n      Connie argues that the law of the case doctrine does not apply because\n\nthe supreme court addressed a question of fact, not a question of law, when it\n\nheld that the trial court abused its discretion by entering the temporary order. We\n\ndisagree because ―[r]eview of a trial court‘s action under the abuse of discretion\n\nstandard is a question of law.‖ Landerman, 247 S.W.3d at 433 (citing El Dorado\n\nMotors, Inc. v. Koch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987307\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987307/el-dorado-motors-inc-v-koch/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368 (Tex.

The supreme court addressed the issue of whether the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by awarding grandparent access, and it held that Randy did\n\nnot have standing and that Connie had not overcome the presumption that a fit\n\nparent acts in his children‘s best interest by proving that denial of access would\n\nsignificantly impair the children‘s physical health or emotional well-being.\n\nDerzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 332–34.         The question presented in this appeal is\n\nlikewise whether the trial court abused its discretion by awarding visitation to\n\nConnie when she allegedly failed to overcome the presumption that a fit parent\n\nacts in his children‘s best interest by proving that denial of access would\n\nsignificantly impair the children‘s emotional well-being. Thus, we cannot agree\n\nthat the issue now presented differs to such an extent from that in the mandamus\n\nproceeding to make the law of the case doctrine inapplicable.\n\n      Finally, Connie argues that the facts at trial are ―dramatically different‖ than\n\nthose at the time of the temporary orders hearing. She first points to Dr. Otis‘s\n\ntrial testimony and opinions, but we have already discussed the striking\n\nsimilarities in Dr. Otis‘s testimony from the temporary orders hearing and the trial\n\n\n                                         29\n\fand need not repeat them here. Connie also points to Ricky‘s alleged ―extreme‖\n\nalienation of B.G.D.    But Ricky‘s and Connie‘s respective relationships with\n\nB.G.D. are indisputably different than Ricky‘s and Connie‘s respective\n\nrelationships with A.J.D. and J.B.D., and they were indisputably different at the\n\ntime of the temporary orders hearing.\n\n      First, Dr. Otis testified that B.G.D.‘s description of his strained and\n\nemotionally distant relationship with Ricky was not entirely accurate because\n\nB.G.D. was attempting to justify his decision to emancipate and move into\n\nConnie‘s home.       Moreover, Dr. Otis testified that B.G.D.‘s and A.J.D.‘s\n\nexperiences are not equivalent. In fact, Dr. Otis was impressed by A.J.D.‘s ability\n\nto think for himself, to have his own point of view, and to not be affected by\n\nRicky‘s negative feelings about Connie or B.G.D.‘s negative feelings about Ricky;\n\nand he offered a similar opinion of J.B.D.‘s objective view of the conflict between\n\nRicky and the Johnsons. More importantly, Dr. Otis testified that there was more\n\ngoing on with B.G.D. than either Ricky or Connie understood. Dr. Otis described\n\nB.G.D.‘s condition as the ―sleeper effect‖ and explained that his recent\n\nexperience with girlfriends had activated his feelings of loss of his mother in a\n\nway that B.G.D. did not understand and that caused an ―almost panicky\n\ndesperate yearning for that kind of relatedness that he had with his mother at one\n\ntime and ha[d] lost.‖ Dr. Otis testified that A.J.D.‘s and J.B.D.‘s relationships with\n\nRicky are ―far different‖ than B.G.D.‘s, saying that A.J.D. and J.B.D. are ―very\n\nsecurely attached to their dad. They love him dearly. They don‘t ever want that\n\n\n                                         30\n\fto be jeopardized. They feel very secure living with him in relation to him. They\n\ndon‘t share the animosity or the oppositionality or the resentment that [B.G.D.]\n\nexperiences toward his dad.‖ Finally, grandparent visitation with B.G.D. is not at\n\nissue in this appeal. Thus, B.G.D.‘s situation is not comparable to A.J.D.‘s or\n\nJ.B.D.‘s, and we are not convinced that B.G.D.‘s changed relationship with Ricky\n\nsufficiently altered the factual landscape of this case to make the law of the case\n\ndoctrine inapplicable, particularly when Dr. Otis used identical terms to describe\n\nA.J.D.‘s and J.B.D.‘s emotional states both before and after B.G.D.‘s relationship\n\nwith Ricky changed.\n\n      7. The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion\n\n      The circumstances of this case are unfortunate, as are the circumstances\n\nin many grandparent-access cases. As Justice Kennedy wrote in his dissent in\n\nTroxel,\n\n      It must be recognized, of course, that a domestic relations\n      proceeding in and of itself can constitute state intervention that is so\n      disruptive of the parent-child relationship that the constitutional right\n      of a custodial parent to make certain basic determinations for the\n      child‘s welfare becomes implicated . . . . If a single parent who is\n      struggling to raise a child is faced with visitation demands from a\n      third party, the attorney‘s fees alone might destroy [the parent‘s]\n      hopes and plans for the child‘s future. Our system must confront\n      more often the reality that litigation can itself be so disruptive that\n      constitutional protection may be required; and I do not discount the\n      possibility that in some instances the best interests of the child\n      standard may provide insufficient protection to the parent-child\n      relationship. We owe it to the Nation‘s domestic relations structure,\n      however, to proceed with caution.\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\f530 U.S. at 101, 120 S. Ct. at 2079 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). While Justice\n\nKennedy was responding to whether something more than a best-interests\n\nstandard should govern third-party access suits, Justice Kennedy‘s observations\n\nare especially poignant, particularly in cases like this one.\n\n      Ricky is a single parent who, by all accounts, adequately feeds, clothes,\n\nand shelters his children, and his fitness as a parent is demonstrated by A.J.D.‘s\n\nand J.B.D.‘s significant emotional and social improvement in the years following\n\ntheir mother‘s death. Of course, Connie and her family believe, with support from\n\nDr. Otis, that Ricky could outwardly exhibit more emotion when interacting with\n\nhis children, but courts must tread lightly when interfering with a fit parent‘s\n\ndecision to limit his children‘s access to their extended family.        As Justice\n\nO‘Connor wrote for the plurality in Troxel, ―In an ideal world, parents might\n\nalways seek to cultivate the bonds             between grandparents and their\n\ngrandchildren. Needless to say, however, our world is far from perfect, and in it\n\nthe decision whether such an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial in\n\nany specific case is for the parent to make in the first instance.‖ Id. at 70, 120 S.\n\nCt. at 2062.\n\n      Because our state supreme court previously held that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by ordering grandparent visitation to Connie based on\n\ntestimony by Dr. Otis that does not substantively differ from Dr. Otis‘s trial\n\ntestimony, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by granting, over\n\nRicky‘s objection, Connie‘s petition for grandparent visitation. See Scheller, 325\n\n\n                                         32\n\fS.W.3d at 643–44; Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d at 334. We therefore sustain Ricky‘s\n\nfirst issue.8\n\n                               IV. Attorney’s Fees\n\n       In his seventh issue, Ricky asks that we remand the case to the trial court\n\nfor further consideration of his request for attorney‘s fees.         ―The award of\n\nattorney's fees in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship is within the trial\n\ncourt‘s discretion.‖ Bruni v.

Code Ann. § 106.002(a) (West 2008). Given our disposition of Ricky‘s first\n\nissue, Ricky is now the prevailing party in this litigation. Although Ricky‘s status\n\nas the prevailing party is only one consideration in the trial court‘s exercise of\n\ndiscretion when deciding whether to award him attorney‘s fees, remand for\n\nreconsideration of the recoverability of Ricky‘s fees is appropriate. We therefore\n\nsustain Ricky‘s seventh issue and remand this case to the trial court so that the\n\ntrial court may reconsider whether Ricky should recover attorney‘s fees from\n\nConnie. See Bruni, 924 S.W.2d at 368–69 (remanding case to permit trial court\n\nto reconsider attorney‘s fee award in light of decision on appeal).\n\n\n\n\n       8\n       Given our disposition of Ricky‘s first issue, we do not reach his third\nthrough sixth issues. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1 (requiring appellate court to\naddress ―every issue raised and necessary to final disposition of the appeal‖).\n\n\n                                         33\n\f                                 V. Conclusion\n\n      Having overruled Ricky‘s second issue; having sustained his first and\n\nseventh issues; and having not reached his third, fourth, fifth, or sixth issues, we\n\nreverse the trial court‘s judgment and remand this case to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    ANNE GARDNER\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: GARDNER, WALKER, and MCCOY, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: August 25, 2011\n\n\n\n\n                                        34\n\f</pre>",
