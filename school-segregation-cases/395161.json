After review, we affirm.\n\n                                         1\n\f                                          I. FACTS1\n\n      On May 28, 1991, Plaintiff-Appellant Kimberly Campbell was transferred to the\n\nGeorgia Women’s Correctional Institution (“GWCI”) to serve five years of a ten-year\n\nsentence for distribution of cocaine and interference with government property.\n\nPlaintiff’s constitutional claims arise from the medical treatment she received at the\n\nGWCI state prison between May 28, 1991, and January 30, 1992.\n\nA.    Mental Health Treatment\n\n      The day Plaintiff arrived at GWCI, she was seen by physician Grant Carmichael,\n\nwho noted that Plaintiff had a history of suicidal threats and had taken psychotropic\n\ndrugs previously at the Cobb County jail. Carmichael referred Plaintiff to the mental\n\nhealth staff for a mental status exam.\n\n      That same day, Plaintiff met with mental health counselor Anne Weathers for\n\na mental status exam. Weathers obtained from Plaintiff extensive details about her\n\npsychiatric history, including prior medications, hospitalizations, treatments, and\n\nsymptoms, and she prepared a three-page report summarizing her observations and\n\nfindings.\n\n\n\n       1\n         The magistrate judge devoted 43 pages of a 102-page order to giving a detailed\nsummary of Plaintiff’s treatment at GWCI. Rather than reiterating the same details, we give\nonly an overview of the facts, highlighting a few representative occurrences of Plaintiff’s self-\ndestructive behavior and Defendants’ various responses.\n\n                                                2\n                                                2\n\f      Weathers’s report first details Plaintiff’s own descriptions of her history of\n\nalcohol and drug use. Plaintiff admitted using drugs on and off since age thirteen and\n\ndrinking excessively–as much as a half pint of liquor a day and a quart of beer a day.\n\nThe report indicates that Plaintiff used marijuana at first, then beer, Valium, and\n\nultimately “cocaine/crack.”\n\n      Weathers’s report then focuses on Plaintiff’s psychiatric history. Plaintiff told\n\nWeathers that while in school, she received mental health services for “problems with\n\nnerves” but no medications. Plaintiff also reported having a “nervous breakdown” at\n\nage eighteen, being hospitalized for a month and a half, receiving Valium, and having\n\na seizure. After release from the hospital, Plaintiff received services in a day hospital\n\nfor several months. She continued to have problems with nerves and panic attacks, and\n\nshe got Darvon and Valium from friends to help her cope with these problems.\n\nPlaintiff related two suicidal incidents to Weathers: at age nineteen, Plaintiff cut her\n\nwrist superficially, and at age twenty-two, she took an overdose of lithium in the\n\npresence of her husband’s son.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         In the district court, Plaintiff introduced medical records showing that between 1982\nand 1988, she had been hospitalized thirteen different times seeking treatment for depression,\nmood swings, suicide attempts, anxiety, paranoia, sleep disturbances, and substance abuse.\nAlthough these records show Plaintiff was treated with various medications, including Stelazine\nand lithium, they show no diagnosis of bipolar disorder–the diagnosis Plaintiff contends\nDefendants should have made.\n\n                                               3\n                                               3\n\f       Weathers’s report next turns to Plaintiff’s treatment at the Cobb County jail after\n\nshe was arrested on the cocaine offense. Plaintiff told Weathers that while in the jail,\n\nshe became anxious, was panicky, heard loud bells ringing in her head, began to sweat,\n\nand felt claustrophobic. Plaintiff reported that she was seen by a psychologist and\n\nreceived lithium, Stelazine, Mellaril and Benadryl. According to Plaintiff’s account,\n\nshe received mental health care in the jail because she told jail officials she was\n\nthinking of harming herself. Plaintiff reported that the last four days at the jail, she had\n\nnot received any medications.\n\n       Weathers’s report states that she contacted the Cobb County jail and confirmed\n\nthat Plaintiff had received the above medications at the jail and that when she left their\n\nfacility she was taking Trilafon. The jail also advised that Plaintiff was intoxicated\n\nupon admission to the jail, was unstable and began taking off her clothes, and made\n\nstatements about self injury. The jail placed her on suicidal precaution. Weathers’s\n\nreport relates that the jail officials believed Plaintiff’s suicide threats were a\n\n“manipulative ploy” because the jail was reducing her medication:\n\n       They said that off and on throughout the stay that she did make\n       statements about intent to harm herself, but that it was noted that it\n       appeared to be a manipulative ploy in that they were reducing her\n       medication to stabilize her. They did not consider that she was making\n       a serious suicide threat; however, they did place her on suicide watch on\n       several occasions as a precaution.\n\n\n\n                                             4\n                                             4\n\f      Weathers’s report also contains Weathers’s own observations from interviewing\n\nPlaintiff. According to the report, Plaintiff’s memory was intact for recent and remote\n\nevents, and there was no evidence Plaintiff was responding to hallucinations. While\n\ndenying “delusions and grandiose ideation,” Plaintiff reported being anxious, described\n\na fear of being out of control, and requested to see a doctor to be placed on medication\n\n“to help her rest.” Weathers’s report concludes with the following recommendation\n\nthat Plaintiff be seen by a psychiatrist:\n\n      Ms. Campbell reports a history of panic attacks and anxiety related\n      symptoms. She also gives a history of suicidal thoughts and manipulative\n      suicidal acts. At the present time, she denies intent to harm herself and\n      signs of anxiety. As she was taking medication while in the Cobb County\n      jail it is recommended that she be seen by Dr. Sikes to evaluate the need\n      for continuing medication and to make recommendation for treatment.\n\n      Dr. James Sikes, a psychiatrist, met with Plaintiff on June 3, 1991. Before the\n\nmeeting, he reviewed Weathers’s report, which he noted specified that Plaintiff had\n\nbeen prescribed psychotropic drugs lithium and Trilafon at the Cobb County jail. Sikes\n\nnoted, too, that Plaintiff had related a long history of intravenous use of cocaine as well\n\nas heavy alcohol consumption. His report states that the intermittent anxiety and\n\npsychiatric hospitalizations in Weathers’s report appeared to arise from complications\n\nwith drugs and medication. Moreover, Sikes noted that Plaintiff denied having any\n\nschizophrenic episodes, auditory hallucinations, or delusional thoughts.\n\n\n\n                                            5\n                                            5\n\f      At the meeting with Plaintiff, Sikes observed Plaintiff’s current condition. He\n\nfound her to be calm and cooperative. He saw no evidence of delusional thought or\n\nloosening of associations. After meeting with Plaintiff and reviewing Weathers’s\n\nreport, Sikes directed that Plaintiff’s Trilafon be discontinued.\n\n      Sikes scheduled a follow-up session with Plaintiff for July 1 in order to observe\n\nher behavior once she had been off Trilafon for a few weeks. Sikes’s report from that\n\nmeeting notes the absence of any reported problems up to that point. The report also\n\nstates that at the interview, Plaintiff told Sikes she had experienced trouble sleeping\n\nand “what she consider[ed] as normal adjustment to the prison.” Sikes suggested\n\nincreased activity but reported “no evidence of a schizophrenic illness.”\n\n      Sikes met with Campbell again on August 12. His reports from that meeting\n\nindicate he diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from polysubstance abuse arising from her\n\nprior alcohol and drug abuse. Sikes also noted that Plaintiff was “angry and resentful\n\nof being called up to talk about things” and that she would probably “continue to clash\n\nwith authoritative figures.” His thoughts on Plaintiff’s condition remained unchanged:\n\n“I see no indication of schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder and will continue to see her\n\nas needed should further concerns occur.” Sikes found no indications of schizophrenia\n\n(a thought disorder) or bipolar disorder (a mood disorder) because Plaintiff showed “no\n\nlooseness of associations, no evidence of delusional thought”; he explained, “this\n\n\n                                           6\n                                           6\n\fseems to be a failure to adjust to the conditions of incarceration rather than a presence\n\nof a psychiatric illness.” Sikes concluded that psychotropic medication should not be\n\nprescribed absent a diagnosis of mental illness. According to Sikes’s reports, he did\n\nnot prescribe psychotropic medication because he diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from\n\npolysubstance abuse and not a mental illness.\n\n      Sikes and other mental health professionals met with Plaintiff numerous times\n\nin the months ahead. Sikes himself saw Plaintiff sixteen times: June 3, July 1, August\n\n12, September 4 or 6, 18, 20, 23, 25, and 30, October 9 and 25, November 1, 8, and 25,\n\nDecember 6, and January 29. In mid-September, when Plaintiff’s behavior began to\n\ndeteriorate, Sikes reported, “It appears that this woman ‘acts strangely’ to get attention\n\nor perhaps to earn additional privileges or perhaps to avoid prosecution for her various\n\ndisciplinaries.” He recommended establishment and enforcement of clear rules in\n\norder to aid Plaintiff in learning to respect and obey authority. Sikes was confident of\n\nPlaintiff’s capability to conform her behavior to institutional rules. He thus explained,\n\n“She has a temper as many inmates do but she should be held accountable for whatever\n\nrules she breaks.” During each meeting with Plaintiff, Sikes continued to find no\n\nevidence of a psychiatric illness justifying treatment with medication.\n\n      Other members of the mental health staff also met with Campbell and reached\n\nsimilar conclusions. Plaintiff was placed on the caseload of mental health counselor\n\n\n                                            7\n                                            7\n\fValarie Ford. Ford met with Plaintiff thirty-four times between August 1991 and\n\nJanuary 1992: August 1, September 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, and 27, October 10, 14,\n\n15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, and 29, November 4, 6, 13, and 19, December 4, 5,\n\n6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 18, and January 14. Ford reports that she also saw Campbell\n\ninformally almost every day during that time period. According to Ford, from the time\n\nof the first meeting she perceived Campbell’s behavior as manipulative and saw no\n\nevidence of psychosis.\n\n       After her first meeting with Plaintiff, Ford referred Plaintiff to Psychologist Dr.\n\nArcher Moore, who also met with Plaintiff on August 1. Moore’s report from that\n\nmeeting states Plaintiff was “a very angry young woman who denie[d] any thought of\n\nhurting herself.” Moore found “good reality contact” but “strong narcissistic features.”\n\nDuring Plaintiff’s stay at GWCI, Moore saw her six times total, (August 1, September\n\n5, 19, 26, and October 10 and 14), and he believed she suffered from a “Narcissistic\n\nPersonality Disorder” and not a mental illness but stressed that he considered Plaintiff\n\nto be primarily Sikes’s patient.\n\n       No one on the GWCI staff ever diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from bipolar\n\ndisorder or prescribed psychotropic medications. Instead, the GWCI staff attributed\n\nPlaintiff’s behavior to the lingering effects of her prior substance abuse, the difficulties\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n                                             8\n\fof adjusting to life in prison, and, on some occasions, deliberate attempts to manipulate\n\nofficials.\n\nB.     Restraints\n\n       During June, July, and August 1991, Plaintiff was sanctioned a few times for\n\nminor disciplinary infractions. In September 1991, however, Plaintiff began engaging\n\nin defiant behavior that eventually became violent, self-destructive, and even suicidal.\n\nOn several occasions, she thrashed about her cell, climbed up on the sink, ripped her\n\nsheets to shreds, beat on and dismantled the overhead light, and attempted to obtain\n\nsharp objects. Plaintiff also bit and scratched prison officials and threatened to “hurt\n\nsomeone.” Plaintiff often threatened to flood the toilet, which posed a security risk\n\nbecause it could mandate evacuation of other cells in the unit. In addition, Plaintiff\n\nstarted multiple fires in her cell, burning her food tray, her Bible, her clothing, and\n\nother such items. One clothing fire she started caused her entire cellblock to be\n\nevacuated.\n\n       Prison officials responded by removing potentially harmful belongings,\n\ninstituting terms of solitary confinement, and restraining Plaintiff using several forms\n\nof restraint.   Officials gradually increased the level of restraint.        They used\n\nstraightjackets on several occasions, which made Plaintiff’s hands unusable but left her\n\nable to walk around the cell. On at least one occasion when officials used only a\n\n\n                                           9\n                                           9\n\fstraightjacket, Plaintiff began banging her head and kicking. When Plaintiff’s behavior\n\nescalated, officials also used “four-point restraints” at least five times, anchoring each\n\nof her arms and legs to a different point on the bed.\n\n      Throughout her stay at GWCI, Plaintiff demonstrated an uncanny ability to\n\nescape from most forms of restraint. She removed her straightjacket on numerous\n\noccasions, and at least once, she freed herself from four-point restraints.\n\n      Plaintiff’s complaint, however, focuses mainly on the instances in which\n\nofficials employed a third method of restraint that left her in an “L” shape3 with her\n\nknees bent so that her calves were perpendicular to her back. To use this form of\n\nrestraint, officials first immobilized Plaintiff’s hands and arms using either a\n\nstraightjacket or handcuffs behind her back. Next, they put handcuffs on her ankles.\n\nFinally, they used a strap that ran the length from the handcuffs on her ankles up to the\n\nhandcuffs on her wrists. This left Plaintiff in an “L” shape, with her body from her\n\nhead to her knees defining the vertical part of the “L” and the lower portion of her\n\nlegs–from her knees along her calves to her feet–defining the horizontal portion of the\n\n“L.” This “L” shape restraint would have resulted in Plaintiff’s being in a kneeling\n\nposition had she been left upright. Most of the time, she was lying on her side with the\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        Plaintiff calls it “hog-tying,” and Defendants call it “tethering.” We refer to it as the\n“L” shape method of restraint.\n                                                10\n                                                10\n\f“L” shape on a plane parallel to the ground. On at least one occasion, Plaintiff freed\n\nherself from the leg tether while this “L” shape form of restraint was being used.\n\n      Although Plaintiff entered GWCI in May 1991, Sikes first ordered Plaintiff\n\nrestrained using this “L” shape method on September 18, 1991. On September 17,\n\nPlaintiff was observed standing on the bed with a sheet wrapped around the back of her\n\nneck. Believing Plaintiff might be trying to commit suicide, mental health staff\n\nremoved her clothing and other belongings, placed her in seclusion, conducted security\n\nchecks every fifteen minutes, and monitored her condition using a camera.\n\n      The next morning, Plaintiff was sent to Sikes for evaluation. She yelled at Sikes,\n\nturned over a table, and broke a phone. When Plaintiff was returned to seclusion and\n\nordered to strip in front of male guards, she refused. Upon a second request, she\n\ncomplied but began running around the cell, kicking and butting the wall. Officials\n\nthen contacted Sikes, who ordered Plaintiff placed in a straightjacket, which\n\nimmobilized her hands and arms. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff began banging her head\n\nand kicking. When informed of this behavior, Sikes ordered that Plaintiff be placed\n\nin a helmet and that the “L” shape restraint be employed. This immobilized her legs\n\nas well as her arms, preventing her from jumping, climbing, kicking, and running\n\naround the cell.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n                                          11\n\f      Between September 18 and October 28, officials restrained Plaintiff using this\n\n“L” shape method five times.4 In addition to the twenty-seven hours on September 18\n\nto 19, the “L” shape restraints were applied for about one hour and twenty-five minutes\n\non September 22, five hours on October 12 to 13, sixteen hours on October 23 to 24,\n\nand sixty-six hours and forty minutes on October 25 to 28.5\n\n      Although the restraints undoubtedly caused physical discomfort and emotional\n\npain, they undisputedly caused Plaintiff no physical injury. It is also undisputed that\n\nofficials monitored Plaintiff’s physical condition while she was restrained. Plaintiff’s\n\ncirculation was checked each time the “L” shape method of restraint was applied, and\n\nsecurity officers checked her every fifteen minutes while she was restrained. Medical\n\nstaff also provided regular checks; a nurse assessed Plaintiff’s condition every few\n\nhours, and a doctor reevaluated the need for restraints every twenty-four hours.\n\n       4\n         Plaintiff actually alleges “at least five times.” Undisputed facts include five clear\ninstances of the “L” shape restraint and other times when the exact type of restraint used is\nunclear.\n       5\n          Although we describe only the first use of the “L”shape restraint, the magistrate judge’s\norder details all five occurrences and Plaintiff’s violent and often self-destructive behavior\nprecipitating the use of the “L” shape restraint. The approximate periods of the “L” shape\nrestraint are (1) from 10:05 a.m. on September 18 to 1:05 p.m. on September 19; (2) from 10:20\np.m. to 11:45 p.m. on September 22; (3) from 9:45 p.m. on October 12 to 2:45 a.m. on October\n13; (4) from 10:05 p.m. on October 23 to 2:15 p.m. on October 24; (5) from 3:30 p.m. on\nOctober 25 to 10:10 a.m. on October 28.\n\n         During these periods of restraint, Campbell was reevaluated every twenty-four hours and\nleft in restraints only if her self-injurious inclinations were still apparent. For example, restraints\nwere continued during the longest (almost 67-hour) period of restraint because Campbell\nthreatened to drink Clorox if the restraints were removed.\n                                                 12\n                                                 12\n\f      On at least two occasions, Defendant Sikes declined to approve restraints\n\nrequested by other officials. Plaintiff admits that on each of these occasions, Sikes\n\nexplained to the requesting officers that restraints were inappropriate when Plaintiff did\n\nnot pose an immediate threat to her own safety.\n\n      Although used five times between September 19 and October 28, the “L” shape\n\nrestraints were not used during November and December 1991 or January 1992.\n\nPlaintiff asserts the “L” shape restraints were discontinued because a prison deputy\n\ncommissioner had issued an edict proscribing “hogtying.”\n\nC.    Outside Evaluations\n\n      In December 1991, Plaintiff requested to be taken off the mental health caseload.\n\nThe staff conferred and determined that Plaintiff did not have an Axis I diagnosis and\n\nthat she would still have a counselor and access to mental health services as needed in\n\nthe general population. Thus, they granted her request and reassigned her to the\n\ngeneral population on December 31.\n\n      On January 28, 1992, Plaintiff was placed in four-point restraints for setting four\n\nfires and breaking the lights in her cell. On January 29, Plaintiff wrapped torn strips\n\nfrom her jumpsuit around her neck in an attempted suicide. The next day officials sent\n\nher to a forensic mental health unit at Central State Hospital for additional psychiatric\n\n\n\n\n                                           13\n                                           13\n\fevaluation. Doctors there diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from bipolar disorder and\n\nprescribed the psychotropic medications lithium and Mellaril.\n\n      Plaintiff was returned to GWCI for the remainder of her incarceration. Because\n\nSikes was no longer working at GWCI, Plaintiff was evaluated by Dr. Richard Panico,\n\nwho had just begun working as a part-time consulting psychiatrist at GWCI. Dr.\n\nPanico diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium.\n\n      Plaintiff was paroled in March 1993. After her release, Plaintiff was admitted\n\nto Georgia Regional Hospital in February 1994. The Georgia Regional Hospital\n\nrecords indicate that the February admission was due to “a serious overdose on\n\nlithium” and that Plaintiff had “a past history of suicidal threats.”\n\n      Plaintiff was admitted again to Georgia Regional Hospital for reevaluation and\n\ntreatment on April 28, 1994. At this admission, psychological testing was done to aid\n\nin evaluating Plaintiff. The Georgia Regional Hospital records reveal that Plaintiff was\n\ndiagnosed as presenting a “personality disorder,” “with borderline anti-social features,\n\nand an Axis I diagnosis of alcohol and substance abuse.” At Georgia Regional\n\nHospital, the treating psychiatrist specifically noted that “Plaintiff did not present an\n\nAxis I diagnosis of bipolar disorder.”\n\n                           II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.    Complaint\n\n\n                                           14\n                                           14\n\f      Plaintiff filed a complaint in state court in nine counts: (1) a § 1983 claim for\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs; (2) a § 1983 claim for cruel and\n\nunusual punishment through use of stripping, restraint, and isolation; (3) a § 1983\n\nclaim for excessive force; (4) a § 1983 substantive-due-process claim for punishment\n\nin lieu of treatment; (5) a § 1983 claim alleging infringements of Plaintiff’s procedural-\n\ndue-process and First Amendment rights; (6) a claim under the Georgia Tort Claims\n\nAct (“GTCA”) for medical and professional negligence; (7) a GTCA claim for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress; (8) a GTCA claim for neligence and\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress against Sikes and Moore as independent\n\ncontractors; and (9) a claim alleging violations of the Georgia Constitution and a\n\nGeorgia statute regarding types of punishment. The five defendants in Plaintiff’s\n\ninitial complaint were the Georgia Department of Corrections (“GDOC”), Mental\n\nHealth Director Albert Duncan, Psychiatrist James Sikes, Psychologist Archer Moore,\n\nand Warden Art Gavin.\n\n      Defendants removed to federal court in the Northern District of Georgia. In\n\nfederal court, Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint, which incorporates the claims\n\nin the initial complaint and adds Mental Health Counselor Valarie Ford as a Defendant.\n\nThe district court granted Plaintiff’s motion to amend.\n\n\n\n\n                                           15\n                                           15\n\f      The district court also granted in part Plaintiff’s motion to remand to state court,\n\nremanding all claims against the GDOC and any official-capacity claims against\n\nDuncan, Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford. Thus, remaining in federal court were\n\nPlaintiff’s individual-capacity claims against Duncan, Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford.\n\nB.    Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n      After Defendants’ motion for a transfer to the federal court in the Middle District\n\nof Georgia was granted, the parties consented to proceeding before a magistrate judge\n\nand began discovery. Defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment,\n\narguing Plaintiff had failed to allege a constitutional violation and asserting qualified\n\nimmunity.\n\nC.    Magistrate Judge’s Order\n\n      On January 28, 1998, the magistrate judge issued an order (1) granting\n\nDefendants Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford summary judgment based on qualified\n\nimmunity on all five of Plaintiff’s § 1983 claims; (2) granting those Defendants\n\nsummary judgment on any Georgia Tort Claims Act claims still in federal court; and\n\n(3) with Plaintiff’s consent, dismissing Duncan as an improper party.\n\nD.    Scope of This Appeal\n\n      Plaintiff’s appeal challenges only the magistrate judge’s grant of summary\n\njudgment on her § 1983 claims against Defendants Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford.\n\n\n                                           16\n                                           16\n\fPlaintiff does not appeal the dismissal of Defendant Duncan or the grant of summary\n\njudgment for Defendants on any Georgia Tort Claims Act claims remaining in federal\n\ncourt. Plaintiff also abandons certain constitutional violations alleged in her first\n\namended complaint. She primarily focuses on two distinct alleged violations of the\n\nEighth Amendment: (1) Defendants’ deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,\n\nand (2) Defendants’ excessive force.\n\n      Thus, on appeal, we discuss whether the magistrate judge erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment for Defendants Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford on Plaintiff’s §\n\n1983 claims for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs and for use of\n\nexcessive force.6\n\n    III. REVIEW OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT BASED ON QUALIFIED\n                         IMMUNITY\n\n      We review the magistrate judge's grant of summary judgment de novo. Steele\n\nv. Shah, 87 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir. 1996). In doing so, we “evaluate the summary\n\njudgment record in the light most favorable to . . . the nonmovant,” and we will affirm\n\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment only if the record demonstrates that\n\nthere was no genuine issue of material fact and that Defendants were entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n\n\n       6\n         To the extent that Plaintiff appeals other claims and issues, we find no reversible error\nin the decision of the magistrate judge. See 11th Cir. Rule 36-1.\n\n                                                17\n                                                17\n\f      The magistrate judge’s order and the parties’ briefs focus almost exclusively on\n\nqualified immunity and the question of whether, at the time of Defendants’ actions, the\n\nlaw clearly established that Plaintiff’s rights were being violated. We turn first to an\n\nalternate basis for summary judgment, inquiring whether this record contains any\n\nevidence of an underlying constitutional violation. Because Plaintiff’s evidence would\n\nnot support a reasonable jury’s finding that Defendants violated Plaintiff’s\n\nconstitutional rights, we need not address the applicability of qualified immunity. See\n\nKillian v. Holt, — F.3d —, No. 97-6802 (11th Cir. Feb. 4, 1999) (affirming district\n\ncourt's entry of summary judgment for defendants without qualified immunity analysis\n\nbecause plaintiff “failed to bring forth evidence from which reasonable jurors could\n\nfind that defendant prison officials knew of and were deliberately indifferent to a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm”); Hale v. Tallapoosa County, 50 F.3d 1579, 1582\n\n(11th Cir. 1995) (affirming summary judgment for one defendant without relying on\n\nqualified immunity because the plaintiff’s evidence was “insufficient to support the\n\nlevel of deliberate indifference and causal connection necessary”);7 see also Cottrell\n\nv. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1489-92 (11th Cir. 1996) (in an interlocutory appeal of the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of summary judgment, turning first to plaintiff’s evidence of the\n\n       7\n         See also Crawford-El v. Britton, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 1586 (noting that when a claim\nrequires “proof of wrongful motive,” it may be preferable to begin summary judgment analysis\nby examining the proof of intent because “the immunity question . . . sometimes requires\ncomplicated analysis of legal issues”).\n\n                                             18\n                                             18\n\fconstitutional violation itself and holding, “plaintiff has failed to show a violation of\n\ndue process, and it necessarily follows that the defendants are entitled to summary\n\njudgment on qualified immunity grounds”); Adams v. Poag, 61 F.3d 1537 (11th Cir.\n\n1995) (in another interlocutory appeal of a district court’s denial of summary\n\njudgment, holding defendants were entitled to summary judgment based on qualified\n\nimmunity because plaintiffs had failed to present evidence of deliberate indifference\n\nto support their Eighth Amendment claim).8\n\n                              IV. EIGHTH AMENDMENT\n\n      The Eighth Amendment governs the conditions under which convicted prisoners\n\nare confined and the treatment they receive while in prison. Farmer v. Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. 825, 832 (1994) (quoting Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 31 (1993)); see also\n\nWhitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 327 (1986) (holding that “the Due Process Clause\n\naffords . . . no greater protection”). Although the Constitution does not require\n\ncomfortable prisons, it does not permit inhumane ones. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832\n\n       8\n         We observe that this case–unlike Cottrell and Adams–is an appeal from a final\njudgment, where there is no dispute that we can examine first whether there is sufficient\nevidence to support a reasonable jury’s finding a constitutional violation. However, Cottrell and\nAdams show that even in interlocutory appeals limited strictly to qualified immunity issues, the\nsame procedure is permissible. In another qualified immunity interlocutory appeal, Dolihite v.\nMaughon, 74 F.3d 1027 (11th Cir.) cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 185 (1996), this Court again focused\non the “predicate element of the underlying constitutional tort,” which is “part and parcel of the\ncore qualified immunity issue which is immediately appealable.” Id. at 1033 n.3. Even if\nidentification of the precise knowledge of each defendant is not “part and parcel of the core\nqualified immunity issue,” it is “‘inextricably intertwined’ with the core issue and thus would be\nimmediately appealable.” Id.\n\n                                               19\n                                               19\n\f(quoting Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 349 (1981)). Still, the Eighth Amendment\n\ndoes not authorize judicial reconsideration of “every governmental action affecting the\n\ninterests or well-being of a prisoner,” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 319; instead, “‘[a]fter\n\nincarceration, only the “‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’”. . . constitutes\n\ncruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.’” Id. at 319\n\n(quoting Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 670 (1977) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble,\n\n429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976) (citations omitted))).\n\n       Crucial to establishing an “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” is some\n\nproof that officials acted with specific intent. This specific-intent requirement for an\n\nEighth Amendment violation applies to both failure to provide proper medical care,\n\nSteele v. Shah, 87 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir. 1996), and excessive force, see Whitley,\n\n475 U.S. at 319-21. However, the exact nature of the specific intent required depends\n\non the type of claim at issue. Whitley, 475 U.S. at 319. Thus, we address each claim\n\nin turn.\n\n   V. “DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE” TO SERIOUS MEDICAL NEEDS\n\n       The Eighth Amendment’s proscription of cruel and unusual punishments\n\nprohibits prison officials from exhibiting deliberate indifference to prisoners’ serious\n\nmedical needs. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). The Supreme Court has\n\nbeen careful to note, however, that “a complaint that a physician has been negligent in\n\n\n                                          20\n                                          20\n\fdiagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical\n\nmistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.” Id. at 106. Thus, in Estelle v. Gamble,\n\nwhich first enunciated the “deliberate indifference” standard, the Supreme Court\n\nreinstated the district court’s dismissal of a prisoner’s § 1983 complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim. Noting that the complaint’s primary allegation was that “more should\n\nhave been done” to diagnose and treat a back injury, the Court explained, “A medical\n\ndecision not to order an X-ray, or like measures, does not represent cruel and unusual\n\npunishment. At most it is medical malpractice.” Id. at 107.\n\n      Subsequent Supreme Court cases have refined the inquiry. In Wilson v. Seiter,\n\n501 U.S. 294 (1991), the Supreme Court explained that the Eighth Amendment applies\n\nonly to punishments and that prison conditions are only punishment if a mental element\n\nof punitive intent is shown:\n\n      The source of the intent requirement is not the predilections of this Court,\n      but the Eighth Amendment itself, which bans only cruel and unusual\n      punishment. If the pain inflicted is not formally meted out as punishment\n      by the statute or the sentencing judge, some mental element must be\n      attributed to the inflicting officer before it can qualify.\n\nId. at 300. Although the very imposition of a certain term in prison is punitive, the\n\npunitive purpose of the sentence itself does not convert every attribute of the place of\n\nincarceration into a punishment subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny. Thus,\n\nconditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment only if they (1) rise to the\n\n\n                                           21\n                                           21\n\flevel of a “serious” deprivation; and (2) result from the official’s “deliberate\n\nindifference.” Id. at 297-99. Wilson and subsequent cases refer to these two required\n\nelements as an “objective component” scrutinizing the alleged deprivation and a\n\n“subjective component” examining the official’s mental intent.\n\nA.    Farmer v. Brennan Requires Proof Of Subjective Mental Intent\n\n      Most recently, in Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994), the Supreme Court\n\nexplained further the requisite “subjective component” of a conditions-of-confinement\n\nclaim and defined the exact subjective mental state required for “deliberate\n\nindifference,” as follows:\n\n      [A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment\n      for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the\n      official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or\n      safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference\n      could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must\n      also draw the inference. This approach comports best with the text of the\n      Amendment as our cases have interpreted it. The Eighth Amendment\n      does not outlaw cruel and unusual \"conditions\"; it outlaws cruel and\n      unusual \"punishments.\" An act or omission unaccompanied by\n      knowledge of a significant risk of harm might well be something society\n      wishes to discourage, and if harm does result society might well wish to\n      assure compensation. The common law reflects such concerns when it\n      imposes tort liability on a purely objective basis. But an official's failure\n      to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not,\n      while no cause for commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned\n      as the infliction of punishment.\n\nId. at 837-38 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted). Thus, in light of Farmer,\n\nliability may be imposed for deliberate indifference only if the plaintiff proves the\n\n                                           22\n                                           22\n\fdefendant actually knew of “an excessive risk to inmate health or safety” and\n\ndisregarded that risk. Id. at 837. Proof that the defendant should have perceived the\n\nrisk, but did not, is insufficient. Id. at 838; Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1491\n\n(11th Cir. 1996) (“There is no liability for ‘an official’s failure to alleviate a significant\n\nrisk that he should have perceived but did not . . . .’” (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n838)). Thus, the official must have a subjectively “‘sufficiently culpable state of\n\nmind.’” Cottrell, 85 F.3d at 1491 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834).                     This\n\n“requirement follows from the principle that ‘only the unnecessary and wanton\n\ninfliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment.’” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834\n\n(quoting Wilson, 501 U.S. at 297).\n\nB.     Post-Farmer Decisions\n\n       This Court recently applied Farmer in the psychiatric medical needs context in\n\nSteele v. Shah, 87 F.3d 1266 (11th Cir. 1996). In Steele, a Florida inmate claimed that\n\na prison psychiatrist was deliberately indifferent in discontinuing prescribed\n\npsychotropic medication. The Steele Court explained that under Farmer, summary\n\njudgment must be granted for the defendant official unless the plaintiff presents\n\nevidence of the official’s subjective knowledge, as follows:\n\n       since a finding of deliberate indifference requires a finding of the\n       defendant's subjective awareness of the relevant risk, Farmer v. Brennan,\n       511 U.S. 825, ----, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1979, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), a\n       genuine issue of material fact exists only if the record contains evidence,\n\n                                             23\n                                             23\n\f      albeit circumstantial, Farmer, 511 U.S. at ----, 114 S. Ct. at 1981, of such\n      subjective awareness. See Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1491 (11th\n      Cir.1996) (acknowledging Farmer's requirement of subjective awareness\n      and rejection of a solely objective test of deliberate indifference).\n\nId. at 1269 (emphasis added).\n\n      This subjective knowledge was evidenced in Steele by the underlying facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case. The plaintiff had been prescribed psychotropic medications\n\nat a previous institution. Id. at 1267. When the plaintiff was transferred to a new\n\nprison, the defendant, Dr. Shah, saw the plaintiff for “less than one minute” and\n\ndiscontinued psychotropic medications. Id. Shah did not review any medical records\n\nother than the Treatment Plan listing medications prescribed by the prior institution,\n\nand he did not consult with any medical staff. Id. After Shah discontinued the\n\nplaintiff’s medication, medical staff from the prior institution wrote the new prison\n\nexpressing concern that the plaintiff was a suicide risk, had been on psychotropic\n\nmedication, and was not now receiving his medication. Id. at 1268. Their letters\n\nclarified that the plaintiff had been diagnosed as having “Adjustment Disorder with\n\nAnxious Mood,” needed psychotropic medication, had tried suicide twice, and was\n\nconsidered a suicide risk. Id. at 1267-68. Still, Shah did not respond; the plaintiff\n\ncontinued without psychotropic medication for the duration of his time at the new\n\nprison. Id.\n\n\n\n                                          24\n                                          24\n\f        This Court held that a jury would be entitled to find that Shah had discontinued\n\nthe plaintiff’s medication “on the basis of one cursory interview and without having\n\nreviewed any medical records beyond the Treatment Plan sent over from the Polk\n\nfacility.” Id. at 1270.   The Court continued that a jury could further find that Shah\n\n“‘knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious,’” that Shah\n\n“deliberately disregarded that risk,” and that Shah “was aware from Polk personnel that\n\nSteele was considered by them to be a potential suicide risk, and that that was one basis\n\nfor their prescription of the psychotropic drugs.” Id. (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n842).\n\n        The Steele Court noted that this circuit’s two most directly relevant precedents\n\nboth pre-dated Farmer. Id. at 1269 n.2 (citing Greason v. Kemp, 891 F.2d 829 (11th\n\nCir. 1990); Waldrop v. Evans, 871 F.2d 1030 (11th Cir. 1989)). However, the Steele\n\nCourt found that Farmer did not necessarily affect the holdings in those two pre-Farmer\n\ncases, stating “Greason (surely) and Waldrop (almost as surely) based their specific\n\nholdings on the existence of evidence of subjective awareness.” Id. We understand\n\nSteele’s equivocation about Waldrop’s holding because Waldrop discusses only what\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n                                           25\n\fa reasonable person would have known–an objective test.9 However, we do examine\n\nGreason in detail because Steele relies so heavily on Greason.10\n\n      In Greason, the inmate’s prior therapist at Gwinnett County Mental Health\n\nCenter had sent a letter to the prison doctor describing the inmate’s current mental\n\nstatus, relating his history of mental illness, and noting that he had been hospitalized\n\nthirteen times and diagnosed as a “schizophrenic” with suicidal tendencies. Id. at 831-\n\n32. The therapist urged continuation of the inmate’s medication for his diagnosed\n\nmental illness and close monitoring. Id. The inmate’s psychiatrist at the Georgia\n\nDepartment of Human Resources also sent a letter reporting that the inmate continued\n\n\n       9\n          Waldrop never addresses whether there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to\nfind the defendants knew their case was grossly inadequate. Instead, Waldrop inquires whether\nthere is evidence that the defendants’ actions were grossly incompetent and violated professional\nstandards, and it focuses on what a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would have\nknown. Waldrop, 871 F.2d at1034-36. Thus, Steele was correct in hesitating to rely on\nWaldrop’s assessment of the evidence now that Farmer has clarified the subjective-intent\nrequirement. Steele, 87 F.3d at 1269 n.2. Like the Steele Court, we focus instead on Greason.\n       10\n            We question Steele’s characterization of Greason as basing its holding on evidence of\nsubjective awareness. Greason is a pre-Farmer case that does not purport to apply the Farmer\nsubjective prong. Instead, Greason examines the evidence of deliberate indifference in the\ncontext of an objective qualified immunity analysis. Although Greason does state, “we believe\nthat a trier of fact could find that Dr. Fodor provided such care [grossly inadequate psychiatric\ncare] and, moreover, that he realized that he was doing so at the time,” id. at 835, the ultimate\nholding in Greason is that “a jury could find (1) that Dr. Fodor provided grossly inadequate care\nand (2) that a reasonable person in Dr. Fodor’s position would have known that the care\ndelivered constituted deliberate indifference to Greason’s Eighth Amendment rights.” Id.\n(emphasis supplied).\n         Nonetheless, we are not required to resolve whether Steele correctly characterizes\nGreason’s holding, the precedential effect of Steele’s statements about and reliance on pre-\nFarmer Greason, or whether the facts of Greason would have met the Farmer test because, in any\nevent, Greason’s facts are readily distinguishable from those in this case.\n\n                                              26\n                                              26\n\fto have suicidal thoughts and needed to be maintained on his medication. Id. at 832.\n\nBoth letter reports were in the inmate’s clinical file. Id.\n\n      Two and a half months after the inmate’s arrival, the prison psychiatrist saw him\n\nfor a few minutes, promptly concluded that his condition had stabilized, and\n\ndiscontinued his medications without reviewing the clinical file or assessing his mental\n\nstatus to determine his potential for suicide. About a month later, the psychiatrist saw\n\nthe inmate again for only a few minutes.11 Based on these facts, the Greason Court\n\nfound that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the\n\npsychiatrist provided grossly inadequate medical care “and, moreover, that he realized\n\nthat he was doing so at the time.” Id. at 835 (emphasis supplied).\n\n      The parties also cite other post-Farmer Eleventh Circuit decisions involving\n\ndeliberate indifference to an arrestee’s or an inmate’s non-psychiatric medical needs.\n\nSee, e.g., Lancaster v. Monroe County, Ala., 116 F.3d 1419, 1426-27 (11th Cir. 1997)\n\n(involving a chronic alcoholic dying from a withdrawal-induced seizure while in\n\npretrial detention after his wife warned jailers about his chronic alcoholism and\n\npropensity for life-threatening seizures as he withdraws, directly applying Farmer, and\n\n\n\n       11\n           Later, the inmate’s parents visited the inmate in prison and reported to an assistant who\nworked under the psychiatrist’s supervision that the inmate had suicidal thoughts. Fearing the\ninmate might attempt suicide again, the parents urged the assistant to have the inmate transferred\nto a hospital. The assistant did nothing and did not contact the psychiatrist. Twenty-four days\nlater, the inmate hung himself. Id. at 832-33.\n\n                                                27\n                                                27\n\fholding sufficient evidence presented from which a jury could find that each defendant\n\n“knew [the decedent] had urgent medical needs that would be significantly exacerbated\n\nby delay,” that each defendant “planned to keep [the decedent] in jail without medical\n\nsupervision or treatment until he had a seizure,” and each defendant “delayed obtaining\n\ntreatment for [the decedent] until after he suffered a seizure”); Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85\n\nF.3d 1480, 1490-91 (11th Cir. 1996) (involving an arrestee dying from positional\n\nasphyxia while in a police car, directly applying Farmer, and holding no evidence to\n\nsupport a jury finding that defendant police officers “were consciously aware of and\n\ndisregarded the risk that [decedent arrestee] would suffocate” as a result of defendants’\n\npositioning and restraining decedent arrestee in police car); Adams v. Poag, 61 F.3d\n\n1537, 1543-48 (11th Cir. 1995) (involving inmate with acute asthma and inability to\n\nbreathe, reversing the denial of qualified immunity, and holding that evidence created\n\nfact issues regarding medical malpractice but not deliberate indifference).12 Although\n\nhelpful guidance, these three decisions do not involve deliberate indifference to\n\n\n\n\n       12\n          Although post-Farmer, Adams does not cite or discuss Farmer, but it nonetheless\nstresses that in this Circuit “cases have consistently held that knowledge of the need for medical\ncare and an intentional refusal to provide that care constitutes deliberate indifference.” 61 F.3d\nat 1543 (emphasis supplied).\n\n                                               28\n                                               28\n\fpsychiatric medical needs. Thus, we have focused instead on Steele and Greason,\n\nwhich do.13\n\nC.    Plaintiff’s Contentions\n\n      We now apply the teachings of Farmer, Steele, and Greason to this case.\n\nPlaintiff contends that Defendants’ medical care was grossly inadequate and that\n\nDefendants knew their care was grossly inadequate. According to Plaintiff, the\n\nmedical care Defendants provided was grossly inadequate because Defendants\n\nmisdiagnosed her as having a polysubstance abuse disorder when they knew or should\n\nhave known she had bipolar disorder, discontinued medication that would have treated\n\nher bipolar disorder, improperly used behavior modification techniques, and waited\n\n\n       13\n          The parties also cite this Court’s post-Farmer decisions in Dolihite v. Maughon, 74\nF.3d 1027 (11th Cir. 1996), and Hale v. Tallapoosa County, 50 F.3d 1579 (11th Cir. 1995).\nHowever, we focus on Steele as it involves the subjective element of deliberate indifference (as\nopposed to the objective qualified immunity analysis in Dolihite) and psychiatric medical needs\n(as opposed to inmate-on-inmate violence in Hale), and we discuss Greason because of Steele’s\nreliance on it.\n        Dolihite concerns a juvenile who hung himself while involuntarily civilly committed at a\nstate psychiatric facility, but the majority opinion does not cite Farmer or discuss the subjective\nprong outlined in Farmer. Instead, the majority opinion in Dolihite addresses only the objective\nprong of qualified immunity–whether “a reasonable professional in defendant’s shoes would\nhave known that his challenged actions (or inaction) violated plaintiff’s constitutional rights.”\nId. at 1046.\n        In Hale, the plaintiff arrestee sued for damages arising from being beaten by other\noccupants of an overcrowded, small “bullpen” with detainees not segregated based on proclivity\nfor violence or reasons for confinement. 50 F.3d at 1580-81. The case turned on whether\ndefendants knew about the significant risk of inmate-on-inmate violence but knowingly\ndisregarded that risk and kept the plaintiff arrestee in that bullpen. Id. at 1582-84. The Court\nstressed the evidence that officials admitted knowing that inmate-on-inmate violence occurred in\nthat overcrowded “bullpen” on a regular basis and resulted in injuries requiring medical\ntreatment. Id. at 1583.\n\n                                                29\n                                                29\n\feight months before sending her outside the prison for diagnostic tests. Plaintiff also\n\nsubmits expert testimony stating Defendants’ medical care was grossly inadequate,\n\nwhile Defendants’ experts state Defendants complied with the applicable standard of\n\ncare.\n\n        After review, we agree with the magistrate judge that Plaintiff has presented\n\ninsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that Defendants knew that she had\n\nbipolar disorder, that Defendants knew they had misdiagnosed her as suffering from\n\npolysubstance abuse rather than bipolar disorder, or that Defendants otherwise knew\n\ntheir treatment was grossly inadequate but proceeded with the treatment anyway.\n\nWithout evidence to establish the subjective mental intent prong of deliberate\n\nindifference, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment under Farmer. We address\n\nPlaintiff’s evidence against each Defendant in turn.\n\nD.      Defendant Sikes\n\n        Defendant Sikes is a psychiatrist who worked part time at GWCI. Sikes first met\n\nwith Plaintiff on June 3, 1991, a few days after her transfer to GWCI, and he gave the\n\norder to discontinue her psychotropic medication. Sikes himself saw Plaintiff sixteen\n\ntimes during the eight months before he determined that she needed to go to Central\n\nfor further mental health examination. Sikes was also consulted by mental health staff\n\n\n\n\n                                           30\n                                           30\n\fon numerous other occasions, and he was repeatedly called upon to advise correctional\n\nofficers on how to respond to Plaintiff’s self-destructive behavior.\n\n      Sikes’s liability turns on whether he knew Plaintiff had bipolar disorder, or knew\n\nhe was misdiagnosing Plaintiff, or knew his treatment was otherwise grossly\n\ninadequate but proceeded with the treatment anyway. Sikes’s reports show he\n\ndiagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from polysubstance abuse, and Plaintiff agrees that\n\npsychotropic medication is not proper treatment for polysubstance abuse. Plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint asserts principally that Sikes misdiagnosed her condition, that she had\n\nbipolar disorder rather than merely suffering from polysubstance abuse, that her\n\nbehavior made it obvious that she had bipolar disorder, and that Sikes should have\n\nknown both that she was bipolar and that medication was the proper treatment for\n\nbipolar disorder. In addition, Plaintiff argues any treatment she did receive was both\n\ngrossly inadequate and detrimental to her bipolar condition.\n\n      1.     Facts Regarding Sikes’s Treatment\n\n      Sikes is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s deliberate-indifference\n\nclaim because Plaintiff failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could\n\ninfer that Sikes knew she had bipolar disorder, or knew he was misdiagnosing Plaintiff,\n\nor knew his treatment was otherwise grossly inadequate but proceeded with the\n\ntreatment anyway. See Steele, 87 F.3d at 1269; Greason, 891 F.2d at 835. Turning\n\n\n                                          31\n                                          31\n\ffirst to the initial diagnosis and discontinuation of medication, the undisputed evidence\n\nshows that Sikes discontinued Plaintiff’s medication only after Sikes personally\n\ninterviewed Plaintiff and reviewed a three-page report by Weathers, who had\n\nperformed an extensive review of Plaintiff’s history and symptoms.14 It is also\n\nundisputed that Sikes, unlike the psychiatrists in Steele and Greason, conducted\n\nmultiple follow-up sessions and observed Plaintiff’s behavior repeatedly once she was\n\noff medication; altogether, he met with Campbell sixteen times. Moreover, Weathers’s\n\nreport revealed the Cobb County jail told Weathers that Campbell’s suicidal threats\n\nmight be an attempt to manipulate officials as they were reducing her medication. In\n\nstark contrast, the professionals previously responsible for the plaintiff inmates in\n\nSteele and Greason stressed the inmates’ suicidal tendencies and prior psychiatric\n\ndiagnoses and urged continued medication.\n\n      Plaintiff faults Sikes for not obtaining and reviewing her actual medical records\n\nfrom the Cobb County jail or her prior thirteen hospitalizations as a juvenile.\n\nHowever, Sikes reviewed (a) Weathers’s detailed summary of Weathers’s\n\ncommunications with the Cobb County jail, which included an account of Campbell’s\n\nsymptoms and treatment at the jail, and (b) Weathers’s summary of Plaintiff’s personal\n\n\n       14\n          Sikes says he also performed an independent review of Plaintiff’s history, but Plaintiff\ndisputes that. We thus rely only on Sikes’s personal interview of Campbell and his review of\nWeathers’s report.\n\n                                               32\n                                               32\n\fhistory, which included an account of mental health problems as a juvenile and a prior\n\nhospitalization.   Moreover, the jail records and prior hospitalization records\n\nthemselves, which are in evidence in this case, contain no diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n\n      Plaintiff also points to the fact that Sikes did know she was prescribed Trilafon\n\nand lithium while at the Cobb County jail, which she says should have put Sikes on\n\nnotice she had bipolar disorder. However, the Cobb records themselves show Plaintiff\n\nwas placed on Trilafon and lithium without indicating a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n\nIndeed, in an affidavit, Dr. Youngleson, who prescribed the medication at the jail,\n\ntestifies (1) that Plaintiff was never given any diagnosis while at the jail; (2) that\n\nlooking back, he believes Plaintiff suffered from a personality disorder rather than\n\nbipolar disorder; and (3) that Plaintiff’s threats and self-destructive behavior seemed\n\nmanipulative. The jail records also show Cobb County jail officials’ concerns that\n\nPlaintiff might be “running a game on us” and acting out to manipulate officials.\n\n      Sikes’s ongoing medical treatment is also readily distinguishable from that in\n\nSteele and Greason, where the psychiatrists basically did nothing to treat the inmates\n\nafter discontinuing their medication. See Adams v. Poag, 61 F.3d 1537, 1544 (11th\n\nCir. 1995) (noting that “when the need for medical treatment is obvious, medical care\n\nthat is so cursory as to amount to no treatment at all may constitute deliberate\n\nindifference”). In stark contrast, Sikes spent a great deal of time and effort working\n\n\n                                           33\n                                           33\n\fwith Plaintiff. Sikes also recommended mental health counseling, consistent with his\n\nstated diagnosis that Plaintiff suffered from polysubstance abuse.15 In addition, Sikes\n\nhad other medical staff members monitor Plaintiff’s behavior and symptoms, and he\n\ntook affirmative steps to prevent Plaintiff from harming herself and others. Such\n\nactions readily distinguish Sikes’s care from the deliberate indifference in Steele and\n\nGreason.16\n\n      2.      Expert Testimony\n\n      Lacking direct or circumstantial factual evidence to establish or to allow a jury\n\nto infer Sikes’s knowledge, Plaintiff attempts to create a factual issue regarding Sikes’s\n\nmental intent by submitting opinion testimony by medical experts. In affidavits and\n\ndepositions, Plaintiff’s experts testify that given Plaintiff’s prior hospitalizations and\n\nmedication and her symptoms and behavior, Sikes should have known that Plaintiff\n\nhad bipolar disorder and needed medication and that Sikes’s treatment was grossly\n\ninadequate. In response, Defendants present expert testimony opining that Defendants’\n\nmedical care fully complied with the applicable standards of care and that reasonable\n\n\n\n       15\n          As noted above, Plaintiff was placed on the caseload of mental health counselor\nValarie Ford. Ford conducted 34 counseling sessions with Plaintiff and saw Plaintiff informally\non a near daily basis.\n       16\n           Such actions also readily distinguish this case from the deliberate refusal to give the\npre-trial arrestee any medical treatment in Lancaster v. Monroe County, Ala., 116 F.3d 1419,\n1426-27 (11th Cir. 1997).\n\n                                                 34\n                                                 34\n\fmental health professionals could have reached the same conclusions Defendants\n\nreached and taken the same actions Defendants took. Plaintiff’s experts’ opinion\n\ntestimony directly contradicts that of Defendants’ experts.\n\n      The question becomes whether the opinion testimony by Plaintiff’s experts here\n\ncreates a jury issue regarding Defendants’ subjective mental intent required by Farmer.\n\nMore specifically, the issue is this: since the facts and circumstances of this case do not\n\nallow an inference that Sikes not only should have perceived the risk but also actually\n\ndid perceive it, does the opinion testimony by Plaintiff’s medical experts based on\n\nthose same facts and circumstances provide the missing Farmer link? The answer is\n\nno.\n\n      We begin by examining our precedent for guidance. This circuit has not\n\ndiscussed directly the precise role of expert testimony in a post-Farmer decision\n\nturning on the subjective mental intent of medical professionals sued for deliberate\n\nindifference to an inmate’s serious psychiatric medical needs. Neither Steele nor\n\nGreason relies on opinion testimony by medical experts as evidence that the\n\npsychiatrist knew his care was grossly inadequate. In Steele the plaintiff presented no\n\nexpert testimony at all,17 and in Greason this Court relied on expert testimony only in\n\n       17\n           Indeed, another issue before the Steele Court was whether the district court had erred\nin refusing to appoint an expert witness to assist the plaintiff. 87 F.3d at 1271. The Court\nremanded for the district court to reconsider appointing an expert, noting that “the appropriate\nstandard of psychiatric care” was at issue and that “[e]xpert opinion on that issue and its\n\n                                               35\n                                               35\n\faddressing the objective prong of deliberate indifference.18 Instead, the egregious facts\n\nand circumstances in those cases created the requisite factual issue of deliberate\n\nindifference or wanton conduct.\n\n      The parties rely heavily on this Court’s treatment of expert affidavits in Dolihite\n\nv. Maughon, 74 F.3d 1027 (11th Cir. 1996). However, like Greason, Dolihite\n\nconsiders expert medical affidavits only in relation to the objective inquiry of qualified\n\nimmunity–whether a reasonable medical professional in the defendants’ position would\n\nhave known that the defendants’ actions violated the juvenile’s constitutional rights.19\n\nDolihite acknowledges that in the unique context of a claim of deliberate indifference\n\nto medical needs, expert testimony is relevant to ascertaining the applicability of\n\nqualified immunity:\n\n      Our circuit has indicated that the testimony of medical experts can aid the\n      court in determining whether qualified immunity is appropriate where\n\napplication here obviously might be important to the finder of fact.” Id.; see also Young v. City\nof Augusta, 59 F.3d 1160, 1169-70 (11th Cir. 1995) (upholding the district court’s decision not\nto appoint an expert to assist plaintiff Young because “[t]he presence of a genuine issue of fact\nwith respect to deliberate indifference to Young’s medical needs is apparent from the face of the\nrecord” without any expert testimony).\n       18\n          Greason relies on expert testimony in listing what the defendant psychiatrist would\nhave known had he reviewed the inmate’s file before discontinuing medication: there was\ntestimony by a psychiatrist “that Greason possessed a great number of the characteristics\nassociated with a high suicide risk.” 891 F.2d at 835 n.11. It also relies on expert testimony\n“that Greason received grossly inadequate care,” and it reaffirms a past case’s holding that “the\nconflict among the experts concerning the propriety of the psychiatrist’s professional judgment\ncalls [must] be resolved by the jury.” Greason, 891 F.2d at 835.\n       19\n            See footnote 13 supra.\n\n                                               36\n                                               36\n\f      allegations hinge upon the appropriateness of the actions of medical\n      professionals, including mental health professionals.\n\nId. at 1046. Dolihite does not address the role of expert testimony in determining\n\nwhether a plaintiff has sufficient evidence of the subjective mental intent required for\n\na jury finding of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs under Farmer.\n\nIndeed, the majority opinion in Dolihite does not even cite Farmer. Moreover,\n\nDolihite’s explanation for considering expert testimony is particular to the objective\n\nqualified immunity inquiry:\n\n      Such expert medical testimony, making reference to specific deficiencies\n      in a defendant’s treatment and specific medically accepted standards\n      might, in conjunction with the specific facts of a case, persuade a court\n      that the medical defendant’s actions in the case were clearly as great a\n      departure from appropriate medical standards as previous departures\n      found unconstitutional in prior cases–i.e., might persuade a court that a\n      reasonable professional in defendant’s shoes would have known that his\n      challenged actions (or inaction) violated plaintiff’s constitutional rights.\n\nId. at 1046. Thus, Dolihite’s consideration of expert testimony in applying qualified\n\nimmunity’s objective standard does not answer our question about the role of expert\n\nopinion testimony when applying Farmer’s subjective-intent requirement.\n\n      In two other conditions-of-confinement cases since Farmer, the plaintiffs failed\n\nto create triable issues regarding the defendants’ subjective mental intent. Each\n\nopinion lends support to our ultimate conclusion regarding expert testimony, but\n\nadmittedly neither is squarely on point here. In Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480\n\n\n                                          37\n                                          37\n\f(11th Cir. 1996), this Court held that the plaintiff’s expert affidavit regarding what\n\n“was well known by police” was insufficient to create a jury issue regarding Farmer’s\n\nsubjective component. Id. at 1491. The Court explained that “such a conclusory\n\nstatement about police in general is not evidence about the mental state of these\n\ndefendant officers in particular.” Id. Although helpful guidance on the role of expert\n\ntestimony, Cottrell does not fully answer the question here for two reasons. First,\n\nCottrell involves expert affidavits about police officers’ positioning and restraining\n\narrestees in police cars, as opposed to expert medical testimony. Also, Cottrell appears\n\nto rely in part on the conclusory nature of the affidavits, and not all the testimony\n\nPlaintiff presents in this case is so conclusory.\n\n       Similarly, in Adams v. Poag, 61 F.3d 1537, 1543-48 (11th Cir. 1995), this Court\n\nexamined the plaintiff’s expert testimony and found it failed to create a triable issue\n\nregarding the defendants’ subjective intent. However, as noted above, Adams is\n\nframed in terms of qualified immunity and does not cite Farmer.20 Moreover, Adams,\n\ntoo, seems to rest on particular deficiencies in the wording of the affidavits at\n\nissue–deficiencies that are present in a great deal of, but not all, the testimony Plaintiff\n\nrelies on in this case.\n\n\n\n\n       20\n            See footnote 12 supra.\n\n                                            38\n                                            38\n\f      Lastly, in Hale v. Tallapoosa County, 50 F.3d 1579 (11th Cir. 1995), a post-\n\nFarmer inmate-on-inmate violence case, we considered experts’ opinions, but only\n\nwhere other factual evidence showed the defendant sheriff’s actual knowledge.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, we found a triable issue as to whether the defendant\n\npossessed the subjective mental intent required by Farmer. Id. at 1583. Importantly,\n\nhowever, our finding of a factual issue did not rest on expert testimony alone.\n\nAlthough we noted the expert’s testimony that “given the conditions in the months\n\npreceding [the attack], it was plainly foreseeable to a reasonable law enforcement\n\nofficial that a violent attack was likely to occur,” we also stressed the defendant’s own\n\nadmission “that he knew that inmate-on-inmate violence was occurring on a regular\n\nbasis” and “that he knew the violence sometimes resulted in injuries requiring medical\n\ntreatment.” Id.\n\n      Lacking a controlling application of Farmer’s standard, we turn to Farmer itself.\n\nIn Farmer, the Supreme Court made clear that the subjective mental intent prong\n\nrequires that the official actually know of a substantial risk of serious harm to the\n\ninmate’s health and then disregard that risk. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. An “official’s\n\nfailure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while\n\nno cause for commendation, cannot . . . be condemned as the infliction of punishment.”\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n                                           39\n\fId. at 838. Under Farmer, proof that the defendant should have perceived the risk but\n\ndid not is insufficient. Id. at 838. Farmer also explains:\n\n      When instructing juries in deliberate indifference cases with such issues\n      of proof, courts should be careful to ensure that the requirement of\n      subjective culpability is not lost. It is not enough merely to find that a\n      reasonable person would have known, or that the defendant should have\n      known, and juries should be instructed accordingly.\n\nId. at 843 n.8. Instead, the plaintiff must submit evidence that the medical professional\n\ndefendant actually was aware of the significant risk of serious harm but deliberately\n\nproceeded with grossly inadequate treatment anyway.\n\n      The issue of subjective mental intent under Farmer is different from whether\n\nSikes’s medical treatment was negligent or grossly inadequate. To decide the issue of\n\nsubjective mental intent under Farmer, a jury would inquire (1) whether Sikes was\n\naware of facts about Plaintiff from which he could draw the inference that his present\n\ncourse of treatment presented a substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiff and (2)\n\nwhether he actually drew that inference but persisted in the course of treatment\n\nanyway. There is no direct or circumstantial evidence in this record from which the\n\njury could infer Sikes’s actual knowledge, and Plaintiff’s experts’ testimony does not\n\nprovide the missing link under Farmer–at least under the facts and circumstances of\n\nthis case. Indeed, allowing expert testimony that Sikes should or would have known\n\nto raise a jury issue as to whether he actually knew effectively would nullify Farmer’s\n\n\n                                           40\n                                           40\n\frequirement of subjective mental intent. The deficiency of the expert testimony here\n\narises not necessarily from the specific wording of the experts’ testimony–although\n\nsome of Plaintiff’s affidavits are lacking in many respects21–but from the inherent\n\n\n       21\n          While we do not rely on deficiencies in the wording of the expert affidavits, we do note\na few of their shortcomings. For example, the experts’ testimony contains many conclusory\nstatements that Defendants were deliberately indifferent that do not govern our assessment of the\nevidence. See Dolihite, 74 F.3d at 1046-47 & n.33 (explaining that “an expert opinion which is\nmerely conclusory, even if couched in the language of the relevant legal standard, will be of little\nassistance to a court”); Cottrell, 85 F.3d at 1491 (“[A] conclusory statement about police in\ngeneral is not evidence about the mental state of these defendant officers in particular.”); Rogers\nv. Evans, 792 F.2d 1052, 1062 n.9 (11th Cir. 1986) (holding that an affidavit “phrased in\nconclusory terms” was “defective to create a factual dispute”).\n\n       In addition, some of the affidavits rest on false factual predicates. For instance, the\nopinion of James S. Cheatham, M.D., seems to rely in part on the assumption that Plaintiff had\nbeen diagnosed as suffering for bipolar disorder prior to entering GWCI. Neither the Cobb\nCounty jail records nor the other medical records in evidence contain a prior diagnosis of bipolar\ndisorder.\n\n         Also, of the expert affidavits Plaintiff presents, the principal affidavit that opines about\nwhat medical professionals would know is by John R. Paddock, who has a Ph.D. in psychology.\nDr. Paddock reviews the behavior Defendants observed and the treatment they implemented and\nstates, “Any person with professional credentials in the area of mental illness or the treatment of\nmental or emotional disorders would know that what the Defendants were doing was grossly\nimproper in design, approach, and implementation.” In certain areas, such as prescribing\nmedicine, the training of psychologists and psychiatrists is not equivalent; thus, Dr. Paddock is\nnot a competent expert to testify to what a psychiatrist like Sikes would know about the need to\nprescribe medicine.\n\n         Finally, there is the opinion statement of Kenneth I. Robbins, M.D. that Sikes’s own\ntestimony “demonstrates he knew his behavior was improper.” However, Sikes’s testimony\nitself either does or does not prove knowledge. Dr. Robbins’s opinion about what Sikes’s\ntestimony shows is not probative. Moreover, Sikes’s testimony, that Dr. Robbins refers to here,\ndoes not demonstrate that Sikes knew his behavior was improper. What Dr. Robbins is referring\nto here is that Sikes testified restraints were only to be used in limited situations and that Sikes\nleft his patient in restraints over a weekend. Dr. Robbins concludes from Sikes’s testimony\nabout the limited use of restraints that Sikes knew leaving Plaintiff in restraints over a weekend\nwas improper. However, Dr. Robbins fails to note the undisputed evidence that other\npsychiatrists were on call that weekend, that they were available to answer correctional officers’\n\n                                                41\n                                                41\n\fopinion nature of expert testimony about what a person should or would have known.\n\nThe particular conflicting expert testimony here demonstrates only that there is a\n\ndifference of opinion among professionals about what is accepted practice within the\n\npsychiatric community and what a doctor should or would know. Plaintiff’s experts’\n\ntestimony here at best allows an inference by the jury that a doctor should have\n\nperceived the risk of serious harm but not an inference that the doctor actually did\n\nperceive the risk and persisted in his course of treatment anyway.22\n\n\n\nquestions, and that they were called upon every twenty-four hours to reassess the continued need\nfor restraints. Thus, Sikes’s testimony does not create a factual issue regarding Sikes’s\nknowledge that his care was grossly inadequate–nor does Dr. Robbins’s opinion about Sikes’s\ntestimony.\n       22\n          We located one post-Farmer circuit court decision squarely addressing whether expert\nmedical testimony can create a factual issue about subject mental intent in cases involving\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs. In McKee v. Turner, No. 96-3446 (6th Cir.\nAug. 25, 1997), the Sixth Circuit held the defendant psychiatrist was entitled to summary\njudgment because there was no evidence showing that the psychiatrist had acted with deliberate\nindifference. The expert’s affidavit stated that the defendant psychiatrist had departed from\naccepted standards of medical care and that the risk of suicide “must have been obvious” to the\ndefendant psychiatrist. The Sixth Circuit held that this affidavit was insufficient to support a\nfinding of deliberate indifference, stressing that under Farmer, “the official’s conduct is judged\nby what he actually knew, not by what a reasonable person in his shoes would have known.”\nThe Sixth Circuit concluded:\n\n       The issue here is not whether Dr. Morcos committed medical malpractice, but\n       rather whether Dr. Morcos had knowledge or facts about [Plaintiff] from which he\n       could draw the inference that his present course of treatment presented a\n       substantial risk of serious harm to [Plaintiff], and that he actually drew that\n       inference, but persisted in the course of treatment anyway. There is nothing in the\n       record demonstrating this.\n\n124 F.3d 198; see also Williams v. Mehra, 135 F.3d 1105 (6th Cir.), vacated and set for reh’g en\nbanc, 144 F.3d 428 (6th Cir. 1998).\n\n                                                42\n                                                42\n\f      Of course, rarely if ever will a defendant medical professional admit that he\n\nknew his course of treatment was grossly inadequate but proceeded with that treatment\n\nanyway. Therefore plaintiffs necessarily must use circumstantial evidence to establish\n\nsubjective mental intent. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842; Lancaster v. Monroe County,\n\n116 F.3d 1419, 1426 (11th Cir. 1997); Steele, 87 F.3d at 1269.\n\n      But expert opinion testimony is not essential to that task. For example, in both\n\nSteele and Greason, the plaintiffs created triable issues regarding the defendants’\n\nknowledge without any expert opinion testimony by presenting evidence of the\n\nparticular facts and circumstances in those cases.23 As noted above, the doctor in\n\nSteele stopped Steele’s medication after a “less than one minute” meeting and without\n\nreviewing medical records.         More importantly, the doctor proceeded with no\n\nmedication in the face of warnings from the prior institution that the plaintiff was a\n\nsuicide risk, had tried suicide twice, and needed psychotropic medication. The doctor’s\n\nconduct was similar in Greason: he saw Greason for a few minutes, promptly\n\nconcluded that Greason’s condition had stabilized, and discontinued Greason’s\n\nmedications without reviewing the clinical file or assessing Greason’s mental status to\n\ndetermine his potential for suicide. The letters in the clinical file showed Greason was\n\n       23\n           See also Lancaster v. Monroe County, 116 F.3d 1419, 1426-29 (11th Cir. 1997)\n(finding defendants’ own testimony regarding their knowledge and other evidence that the\ndefendants were personally warned of the detainee’s condition created triable issues regarding\ndefendants’ subjective mental intent without any expert testimony).\n\n                                              43\n                                              43\n\fa schizophrenic, had suicidal tendencies, and needed medication. In both Greason and\n\nSteele, this Court relied on facts and circumstances that made the risk of grossly\n\ninadequate care and suicide so obvious that a jury could infer the defendants’ actual\n\nknowledge. In contrast, here there was no prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and the\n\njail officials advised that they did not consider Plaintiff’s suicide threats to be serious\n\nand that they perceived Plaintiff’s aberrant behavior as an attempt to manipulate\n\nofficials.\n\n       Because Plaintiff has not presented sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence\n\nto create a factual issue regarding Sikes’s subjective mental intent and the experts’\n\nopinion testimony here does not provide the missing link, we affirm the magistrate\n\njudge’s decision to grant Sikes summary judgment on Plaintiff’s deliberate-\n\nindifference claim.\n\nE.     Defendant Moore\n\n       Defendant Moore was a licensed psychologist who worked one day a week at\n\nGWCI.24 Unlike Sikes, Moore could not prescribe medication. Moreover, because\n\nMoore worked at GWCI only one day a week, his duties and responsibilities were\n\n\n\n\n        24\n             On December 7, 1998, Moore’s counsel filed notice that Moore had died on November\n22, 1998.\n\n                                               44\n                                               44\n\fdecided week by week on an as-needed basis. Moore saw Plaintiff six times between\n\nAugust and October 1991. His last contact with Plaintiff was on October 24, 1991.\n\n      Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find\n\nMoore knew that Plaintiff had bipolar disorder or that his treatment was grossly\n\ninadequate. Moore diagnosed Plaintiff as having a personality disorder, as opposed to\n\na mental illness, and Plaintiff has presented no evidence that Moore knew his diagnosis\n\nwas incorrect. Plaintiff’s primary contention is that Moore should have performed\n\npsychological tests even though Sikes did not order them. Again, Plaintiff presents\n\nexpert testimony about Moore’s care, which might establish Moore breached the\n\nstandard of care and was negligent but does not support a finding that Moore knew\n\nPlaintiff was misdiagnosed and needed medication or knew his care was otherwise\n\ninadequate.25 Without evidence of Moore’s subjective intent, Plaintiff’s deliberate-\n\nindifference claim cannot succeed.\n\nF.    Defendant Ford\n\n      Defendant Ford is a mental health counselor, untrained in diagnosing mental\n\nillness and unauthorized to prescribe medication. Plaintiff was assigned to Ford for\n\n\n\n\n       25\n          Some of the expert testimony about Moore’s care seems to rest on the erroneous\nassumption that Moore’s knowledge about Plaintiff was commensurate with Sikes’s. However,\nas with Sikes, we do not rely on particular deficiencies in the affidavits.\n\n                                           45\n                                           45\n\fcounseling during most of the eight-month period in question. Ford had almost daily\n\ncontact with Plaintiff.\n\n      Plaintiff focuses on two alleged deficiencies in the care Ford provided. First,\n\nPlaintiff points to an October 1991 memorandum Ford wrote to prison security\n\npersonnel instructing that they impose maximum disciplinary penalties for Plaintiff’s\n\ninfractions of prison rules. The memorandum states that Plaintiff had received\n\nseventeen prior disciplinary reports, that Plaintiff had been evaluated several times by\n\nDrs. Moore and Sikes, that Plaintiff “does not currently have an Axis I diagnosis,” and\n\nthat therefore “[t]he current treatment goal for Ms. Campbell as recommended by Dr.\n\nSikes and the mental health staff is behavior modification.”\n\n      There is no evidence to support a jury finding that by writing the security\n\nmemorandum Ford was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff’s serious medical needs.\n\nFirst, the memorandum also states that “[m]edical staff will be responsible for ensuring\n\nthat medical needs are met according to policy.” Second, Plaintiff has presented no\n\nevidence that Ford knew Plaintiff suffered from bipolar disorder–much less that Ford\n\nknew Plaintiff’s self-destructive and defiant behavior stemmed from bipolar disorder.\n\n Moreover, Ford wrote this memorandum at Sikes’s direction, acting on the express\n\ninstructions of a medical doctor who was trained in diagnosis of mental illness, had\n\n\n\n\n                                          46\n                                          46\n\fdiagnosed Plaintiff with polysubstance abuse and not bipolar disorder, and had\n\nrecommended behavior modification treatment as opposed to medication.\n\n      Second, Plaintiff faults Ford for the overnight “delay in treatment” once it had\n\nbeen determined that Plaintiff needed to go to Central for further evaluation. It is\n\nundisputed that on the night of January 29, Ford knew it had been determined that\n\nPlaintiff should be sent to Central. It is also undisputed that officials secured Plaintiff\n\nin four-point restraints overnight and sent her to Central the next morning. Plaintiff\n\nalleges that it was Ford’s decision to delay the transfer and that Ford decided to apply\n\nfour-point restraints without a prior order from a medical doctor.26\n\n      Again, however, Plaintiff has presented no evidence that Ford knew that Plaintiff\n\nhad bipolar disorder or that such overnight delay amounted to grossly inadequate care.\n\nDr. Paddock’s affidavit purports to support a finding that Ford “had to know” the care\n\nPlaintiff received was grossly inadequate:\n\n      Defendant Ford was in a position and exercising responsibility in which\n      she would have had to know that further and additional mental\n      health/psychological evaluation and assessment of Ms. Plaintiff were\n      required by her and consistent with the competencies of other members\n      of the treatment team (e.g., licensed psychologists and psychiatric\n      physicians), and that the acts undertaken were grossly deficient.\n\n\n\n\n       26\n         According to Plaintiff, the medical doctor’s order approving the four-point restraints\nused on this occasion was signed almost two months later on March 24, 1991.\n\n                                               47\n                                               47\n\fAs discussed regarding Sikes, this expert affidavit does not suffice to support a finding\n\nthat Ford knew her care was grossly inadequate but persisted in that treatment. At best,\n\nit might support a finding that Ford’s care was grossly inadequate or a finding that\n\nFord should have known or perceived–or “had to know”–her care was grossly\n\ninadequate. However, as explained above, “[t]here is no liability for ‘an official’s\n\nfailure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not . . . .’”\n\nCottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1491 (11th Cir. 1996) (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n838).\n\nG.      Defendant Gavin\n\n        Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant Gavin, the GWCI warden, was not\n\nemployed as a mental health professional. Plaintiff claims only that Gavin was\n\ndeliberately indifferent in supervising others who were deliberately indifferent to her\n\nserious medical needs. By its own terms, Plaintiff’s claim against Gavin cannot\n\nsucceed without evidence of an underlying constitutional violation by one of the\n\nmental health professionals. As explained above, the record contains no such evidence.\n\nThus, Gavin is necessarily entitled to summary judgment on this claim.27\n\n                                    VI. EXCESSIVE FORCE\n\n\n\n\n        27\n             Plaintiff’s supervisory liability claim against Sikes fails for the same reason.\n\n                                                    48\n                                                    48\n\f      Plaintiff also claims that even if Defendants’ actions did not amount to\n\ndeliberate indifference to her serious medical needs, their use of restraints constituted\n\nexcessive force.\n\nA.    Proof Required that Force Used Maliciously and Sadistically to Cause\n      Harm\n\n      The Eighth Amendment’s proscription of cruel and unusual punishments also\n\ngoverns prison officials’ use of force against convicted inmates. See Whitley v.\n\nAlbers, 475 U.S. 312, 327 (1986) (holding that “the Due Process Clause affords\n\n[convicted prisoners] no greater protection than does the Cruel and Unusual\n\nPunishments Clause”). To establish an Eighth Amendment claim for excessive force,\n\nhowever, Plaintiff must meet an intent requirement more stringent than Farmer’s\n\ndeliberate-indifference standard: she must prove that “force was applied . . .\n\nmaliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.” Whitley, 475 U.S.\n\nat 320-21 (quoting Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir. 1973)); see also\n\nHudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1992).\n\n      Discussing this heightened specific-intent requirement in Whitley, the Supreme\n\nCourt reiterated that force does not violate the Eighth Amendment merely because it\n\nis unreasonable or unnecessary: “The infliction of pain in the course of a prison\n\nsecurity measure . . . does not amount to cruel and unusual punishment simply because\n\nit may appear in retrospect that the degree of force authorized or applied for security\n\n                                           49\n                                           49\n\fpurposes was unreasonable, and hence unnecessary in the strict sense.” 475 U.S. at\n\n319. Reviewing the force used to quell a prison riot in Whitley, the Court explained\n\nthat “whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering\n\nultimately turns on ‘whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or\n\nrestore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing\n\nharm.’” Id. at 320-21 (quoting Johnson, 481 F.2d at 1033).\n\n      Subsequently, in Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1 (1992), the Supreme Court\n\nextended Whitley’s holding outside the prison-riot context and applied the same\n\nheightened intent requirement to force used as a prophylactic, preventive measure. See\n\nWhitley, 475 U.S. at 322 (acknowledging the distinction). The Hudson Court held that\n\n“whenever prison officials stand accused of using excessive physical force in violation\n\nof the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is that set out\n\nin Whitley: whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore\n\ndiscipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” Id. at 6-7. The Court\n\nreasoned that even absent the exigency present during a riot-like disturbance,\n\n“‘“[p]rison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the\n\nadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to\n\npreserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”’” Hudson,\n\n503 U.S. at 7 (quoting Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321-22 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.\n\n\n                                           50\n                                           50\n\f520, 547 (1979))). Thus, Hudson dictates that Whitley’s standard–force applied\n\nmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm–applies to all claims that prison officials\n\nused excessive force against convicted prisoners.\n\n      In addition to defining the mental state required, Hudson and Whitley outline\n\nfive distinct factors relevant to ascertaining whether force was used “maliciously and\n\nsadistically for the very purpose of causing harm”: (1) “the extent of injury”; (2) “the\n\nneed for application of force”; (3) “the relationship between that need and the amount\n\nof force used”; (4) “any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response”; and\n\n(5) “the extent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably perceived\n\nby the responsible officials on the basis of facts known to them.” Whitley, 475 U.S.\n\nat 321; see also Hudson, 503 U.S. at 7. Whitley also narrows the precise inquiry\n\napplicable when deciding whether officials are entitled to judgment as a matter of law:\n\n      courts must determine whether the evidence goes beyond a mere dispute\n      over the reasonableness of a particular use of force or the existence of\n      arguably superior alternatives. Unless it appears that the evidence,\n      viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, will support a reliable\n      inference of wantonness in the infliction of pain under the standard we\n      have described, the case should not go to the jury.\n\nWhitley, 475 U.S. at 322 (emphasis added).\n\nB.    Eleventh Circuit Applications\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n                                           51\n\f      Plaintiff’s excessive-force claim focuses on restraints Defendants used while she\n\nwas in isolation. Thus, we review prior decisions of this Court applying Whitley to\n\nuses of restraints and isolation.\n\n      Affirming summary judgment in Williams v. Burton, 943 F.2d 1572 (11th Cir.\n\n1991), this Court held that the officials’ using four-point restraints and a gag was not\n\nexcessive force. Officials placed Williams in four-point restraints, with gauze and tape\n\nover his mouth, for twenty-eight and one-half hours. Id. at 1574. There were only\n\nbrief intervals for eating, physical exercise, and toilet use. Id. Noting that Williams\n\nhad threatened to kill officials, spat on them, and thrown bodily fluids at them, this\n\nCourt explained that the four-point restraints and gag were not excessive force but were\n\nused to prevent Williams from harming himself or officials:\n\n      [t]he four-point restraints were used to reduce or eliminate Williams’\n      ability to inflict physical harm against either himself or the correction\n      officers. The restraints were not used for the purpose of inflicting pain.\n      The gauze padding and tape were used to prevent Williams from\n      encouraging further unrest among the other inmates in the segregation\n      unit, as well as to protect the officers from his continuing spital assault.\n\nId. at 1575. Also important to the Williams decision were the observations (1) that\n\nalthough the inmate “experienced some discomfort because of his restraint, no actual\n\ninjury was inflicted” id.; and (2) that “constant monitoring and examinations by\n\nmedical personnel” were adequate to safeguard the inmate’s well-being. Id.\n\n\n\n                                          52\n                                          52\n\f      Williams stresses that courts should afford great deference to prison officials\n\nregarding the use of restraints as a prophylactic or preventive measure, stating:\n\n      How long restraint may be continued calls for the exercise of good\n      judgment on the part of prison officials. Once it is established that the\n      force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain discipline and not\n      maliciously or sadistically for the purpose of causing harm, the courts\n      give great deference to the actions of prison officials in applying\n      prophylactic or preventive measures intended to reduce the incidence of\n      riots and other breaches of prison discipline.\n\nId. at 1576 (internal citations omitted).       This Court also found the officials’\n\n“continuous observation and management of Williams during his restraint” showed\n\ntheir good faith, and we concurred with the district court’s holding that “Williams’\n\nhistory of persistent disobedience and the potential for a disturbance in the segregation\n\nunit justified the continued use of the restraints and gag until the officers were\n\nreasonably assured that the situation had abated.” Id.\n\n      Similarly, in Sims v. Mashburn, 25 F.3d 980 (11th Cir. 1994), this Court upheld\n\nthe officials’ use of a stripped cell for twenty-nine hours and reversed the district\n\ncourt’s grant of judgment for the inmate. The inmate in Sims hung various items over\n\nthe window to his cell, preventing prison officials from observing his behavior; he\n\nplaced a towel in the toilet, which officers took as an implicit threat to flood the\n\nsegregation unit; and he threatened that if officials entered his cell, “I’ll buck; you’ll\n\nhave to kill me.” Id. at 981. On that basis, officials stripped his cell and removed all\n\n\n                                           53\n                                           53\n\fclothing except his undershorts, and they disconnected the water to his toilet. Id. at\n\n981-82.\n\n      In determining whether the officials had used good faith or acted “maliciously\n\nand sadistically to cause harm,” this Court observed that the officers had followed the\n\nprison’s operating procedures for stripping cells, which required, among other things,\n\ndocumenting the incident and checking on the inmate’s status every fifteen minutes.\n\nId. at 985-86. Again, we emphasized that compliance with an established prison policy\n\nevidences an official’s good faith, particularly when, as in Sims, “[t]he policy itself\n\nreflects a well-developed and planned procedure.” Id. at 986. In the field of prison\n\ndiscipline, “prison officials, not judges, are experts.” Id.\n\nC.    Application To This Case\n\n      Plaintiff focuses on the instances in which officials used the “L” shape restraint\n\nin addition to the straightjacket. The record reflects that officials used the “L” shape\n\nrestraint at least five different times for periods of twenty-seven hours on September\n\n18 to 19, one hour and twenty-five minutes on September 22, five hours on October\n\n12 to 13, sixteen hours on October 23 to 24, and sixty-six hours and forty minutes on\n\nOctober 25 to 28.\n\n      As explained above, Plaintiff’s excessive-force claim depends on whether these\n\nperiods of restraint were instituted “maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose\n\n\n                                           54\n                                           54\n\fof causing harm.” Precedent dictates that this determination be guided by the five\n\nHudson/Whitley factors outlined above, by deference to prison officials’ punitive\n\njudgments, and by this Court’s previous holdings that compliance with prison policies\n\nevidences officials’ good faith. For several reasons, such considerations convince us\n\nthat the record here does not create a factual issue regarding malicious or sadistic\n\nintent.\n\n          First, the urgent need for force was readily apparent each time the “L” shape\n\nrestraint was applied; the undisputed facts show Plaintiff posed a serious threat to\n\nherself and to others. Plaintiff not only told officials that she was considering suicide\n\nbut also actually took steps toward harming herself on more than one occasion. When\n\nthe “L” shape restraint was applied initially in September 1991, officials found her\n\nstanding on the bed with a sheet around her neck. As noted above, on other occasions,\n\nshe thrashed about her cell, climbed up on the sink, ripped her sheets to shreds, beat\n\non and dismantled the overhead light, and attempted to obtain sharp objects. Plaintiff\n\nalso bit and scratched prison officials, and she repeatedly threatened to “hurt\n\nsomeone.” Some of Plaintiff’s actions posed a security risk as well. She regularly\n\nthreatened to flood the toilet, and she often started fires in her cell, burning such items\n\nas her food tray, her Bible, and her clothing. One clothing fire mandated evacuation\n\nof her entire cellblock.\n\n\n                                            55\n                                            55\n\f      Moreover, lesser restraints were ineffective in curbing Plaintiff’s dangerous\n\nbehavior. Plaintiff freed herself from straightjackets on multiple occasions. In\n\naddition, on one occasion when officials used only a straightjacket, Plaintiff began\n\nbanging her head and kicking.\n\n      Although resulting in physical discomfort and emotional pain, the restraints\n\nundisputedly caused Plaintiff no physical injury. More importantly, the officers\n\ncarefully monitored Plaintiff’s physical condition while she was restrained. They\n\nchecked Plaintiff’s circulation each time they applied the “L” shape method of\n\nrestraint, and security officers checked Plaintiff every fifteen minutes while she was\n\nrestrained. There were also regular checks by medical staff, with a nurse evaluating\n\nPlaintiff’s condition every few hours and a doctor reassessing the need for restraints\n\nevery twenty-four hours.\n\n      Additionally, the severity of the restraint was tempered somewhat by attention\n\nto Plaintiff’s basic physical needs. During periods of restraint, Plaintiff was given\n\n“toileting” on request,28 offered meals at regular intervals, and sometimes given a\n\nmattress rather than being made to lie on the floor.\n\n\n\n\n       28\n           Plaintiff asserts that there was one instance in which she urinated on herself while in\nrestraints and the situation was not discovered for some hours.\n\n                                                56\n                                                56\n\f      Also evidencing the officials’ good faith is their compliance with prison\n\nprocedures for using restraints. GWCI policies provide for extensive documentation\n\nand monitoring when restraints are used, and Defendants met and exceeded those\n\nrequirements.      For example, in addition to completing the required written\n\ndocumentation, Defendants videotaped some of the instances in which they used the\n\n“L” shape restraint.29\n\n      In addition, on at least two different occasions, Sikes declined to approve\n\nrestraints when other officials requested them. Each time, Sikes instructed the\n\nrequesting officials that restraints should not be applied when Plaintiff did not pose a\n\nthreat to her own safety. Such decisionmaking by Sikes hardly betrays a malicious or\n\nsadistic motive.\n\n       Plaintiff provides no viable reason to depart from the conclusion dictated by\n\nthese considerations. Her main contention is that four-point restraints would have been\n\nequally effective and less dehumanizing than the “L” shape. In addition, she points to\n\na deputy prison commissioner’s testimony that he was shocked to hear that prisoners\n\nwere being “hog-tied.” However, such evidence raises “a mere dispute over the\n\nreasonableness of a particular use of force or the existence of arguably superior\n\n\n\n       29\n         Plaintiff entered in the record before the magistrate judge a videotape of several “L”\nshape incidents, and that tape is part of the record on appeal as well.\n\n                                               57\n                                               57\n\falternatives,” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 322, and would not suffice to support a jury finding\n\nthat the officials restrained Plaintiff in this manner “maliciously and sadistically for the\n\nvery purpose of causing harm.” Id. at 320-21.\n\n       There is also no showing that the “L” shape method of restraint used here\n\nviolated prison policies.30 Both GDOC and GWCI policies clearly allowed restraints\n\nto be used to curb dangerous behavior, and neither policy forbade this particular\n\nmethod of restraint. GDOC operating procedures merely authorized restraints “to\n\nprevent the inmate from hurting himself or others” and defined “hard restraints” versus\n\n“soft restraints.” GDOC Standard Operating Procedure No. VC01-0014 (Revised Oct.\n\n1, 1989).31 Similarly, GWCI policy authorized restraints as “a temporary means of\n\ncontrolling an inmate’s destructive behavior toward herself and others.” GWCI Policy\n\nStatement No. 801.1 (activated Nov. 1, 1989; revised June 13, 1991). GWCI policy\n\nalso examined the costs and benefits of several different methods of restraint, noting\n\nthat “[t]he following comments should be reviewed and considered in making a\n\ndecision as to which devices to use when restraint is necessary.” Id. The “L” shape\n\n\n       30\n           It is far from clear in the case law that officials’ violating prison policy would\nnecessarily establish the requisite subjective mental intent. In this case, however, because there\nis insufficient evidence to support a finding that prison policies were violated, we need not\naddress whether a violation of prison policies is per se malicious and sadistic.\n       31\n          We refer to the policies in effect when the challenged instances of restraint occurred.\nThere is some indication in the record that since that time, the policies may have been amended\nto proscribe “hog-tying.”\n\n                                                58\n                                                58\n\fmethod used here was not expressly listed, but GWCI policy expressly provided in a\n\nseparate subsection that a physician might “also consider other options as to the\n\nmethod of restraint most likely to be appropriate.” Id.\n\n      Plaintiff argues that the absence of “hog-tying” from the lists of possible\n\nrestraint methods meant the “L” shape method used here was forbidden. In support of\n\nthat contention, she offers the testimony of a deputy prison commissioner who\n\ninterpreted the state operating procedures to ban “hog-tying.” However, the deputy\n\ncommissioner’s testimony is insufficient to create a triable issue in the face of the clear\n\nand unambiguous language of the policies themselves, which did not ban or in any way\n\nproscribe this method of restraint but instead expressly permitted doctors to consider\n\nusing other methods of restraint.\n\n                                 VII. CONCLUSION\n\n      Because we find insufficient evidence to support a jury’s finding that any of the\n\nDefendants possessed the subjective mental intent required to support Plaintiff’s\n\ndeliberate-indifference and excessive-force claims, the magistrate judge’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment for Defendants Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                            59\n                                            59\n\f",

After review, we affirm.\n\n                                         1\n\f                                          I. FACTS1\n\n      On May 28, 1991, Plaintiff-Appellant Kimberly Campbell was transferred to the\n\nGeorgia Women’s Correctional Institution (“GWCI”) to serve five years of a ten-year\n\nsentence for distribution of cocaine and interference with government property.\n\nPlaintiff’s constitutional claims arise from the medical treatment she received at the\n\nGWCI state prison between May 28, 1991, and January 30, 1992.\n\nA.    Mental Health Treatment\n\n      The day Plaintiff arrived at GWCI, she was seen by physician Grant Carmichael,\n\nwho noted that Plaintiff had a history of suicidal threats and had taken psychotropic\n\ndrugs previously at the Cobb County jail. Carmichael referred Plaintiff to the mental\n\nhealth staff for a mental status exam.\n\n      That same day, Plaintiff met with mental health counselor Anne Weathers for\n\na mental status exam. Weathers obtained from Plaintiff extensive details about her\n\npsychiatric history, including prior medications, hospitalizations, treatments, and\n\nsymptoms, and she prepared a three-page report summarizing her observations and\n\nfindings.\n\n\n\n       1\n         The magistrate judge devoted 43 pages of a 102-page order to giving a detailed\nsummary of Plaintiff’s treatment at GWCI. Rather than reiterating the same details, we give\nonly an overview of the facts, highlighting a few representative occurrences of Plaintiff’s self-\ndestructive behavior and Defendants’ various responses.\n\n                                                2\n                                                2\n\f      Weathers’s report first details Plaintiff’s own descriptions of her history of\n\nalcohol and drug use. Plaintiff admitted using drugs on and off since age thirteen and\n\ndrinking excessively–as much as a half pint of liquor a day and a quart of beer a day.\n\nThe report indicates that Plaintiff used marijuana at first, then beer, Valium, and\n\nultimately “cocaine/crack.”\n\n      Weathers’s report then focuses on Plaintiff’s psychiatric history. Plaintiff told\n\nWeathers that while in school, she received mental health services for “problems with\n\nnerves” but no medications. Plaintiff also reported having a “nervous breakdown” at\n\nage eighteen, being hospitalized for a month and a half, receiving Valium, and having\n\na seizure. After release from the hospital, Plaintiff received services in a day hospital\n\nfor several months. She continued to have problems with nerves and panic attacks, and\n\nshe got Darvon and Valium from friends to help her cope with these problems.\n\nPlaintiff related two suicidal incidents to Weathers: at age nineteen, Plaintiff cut her\n\nwrist superficially, and at age twenty-two, she took an overdose of lithium in the\n\npresence of her husband’s son.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         In the district court, Plaintiff introduced medical records showing that between 1982\nand 1988, she had been hospitalized thirteen different times seeking treatment for depression,\nmood swings, suicide attempts, anxiety, paranoia, sleep disturbances, and substance abuse.\nAlthough these records show Plaintiff was treated with various medications, including Stelazine\nand lithium, they show no diagnosis of bipolar disorder–the diagnosis Plaintiff contends\nDefendants should have made.\n\n                                               3\n                                               3\n\f       Weathers’s report next turns to Plaintiff’s treatment at the Cobb County jail after\n\nshe was arrested on the cocaine offense. Plaintiff told Weathers that while in the jail,\n\nshe became anxious, was panicky, heard loud bells ringing in her head, began to sweat,\n\nand felt claustrophobic. Plaintiff reported that she was seen by a psychologist and\n\nreceived lithium, Stelazine, Mellaril and Benadryl. According to Plaintiff’s account,\n\nshe received mental health care in the jail because she told jail officials she was\n\nthinking of harming herself. Plaintiff reported that the last four days at the jail, she had\n\nnot received any medications.\n\n       Weathers’s report states that she contacted the Cobb County jail and confirmed\n\nthat Plaintiff had received the above medications at the jail and that when she left their\n\nfacility she was taking Trilafon. The jail also advised that Plaintiff was intoxicated\n\nupon admission to the jail, was unstable and began taking off her clothes, and made\n\nstatements about self injury. The jail placed her on suicidal precaution. Weathers’s\n\nreport relates that the jail officials believed Plaintiff’s suicide threats were a\n\n“manipulative ploy” because the jail was reducing her medication:\n\n       They said that off and on throughout the stay that she did make\n       statements about intent to harm herself, but that it was noted that it\n       appeared to be a manipulative ploy in that they were reducing her\n       medication to stabilize her. They did not consider that she was making\n       a serious suicide threat; however, they did place her on suicide watch on\n       several occasions as a precaution.\n\n\n\n                                             4\n                                             4\n\f      Weathers’s report also contains Weathers’s own observations from interviewing\n\nPlaintiff. According to the report, Plaintiff’s memory was intact for recent and remote\n\nevents, and there was no evidence Plaintiff was responding to hallucinations. While\n\ndenying “delusions and grandiose ideation,” Plaintiff reported being anxious, described\n\na fear of being out of control, and requested to see a doctor to be placed on medication\n\n“to help her rest.” Weathers’s report concludes with the following recommendation\n\nthat Plaintiff be seen by a psychiatrist:\n\n      Ms. Campbell reports a history of panic attacks and anxiety related\n      symptoms. She also gives a history of suicidal thoughts and manipulative\n      suicidal acts. At the present time, she denies intent to harm herself and\n      signs of anxiety. As she was taking medication while in the Cobb County\n      jail it is recommended that she be seen by Dr. Sikes to evaluate the need\n      for continuing medication and to make recommendation for treatment.\n\n      Dr. James Sikes, a psychiatrist, met with Plaintiff on June 3, 1991. Before the\n\nmeeting, he reviewed Weathers’s report, which he noted specified that Plaintiff had\n\nbeen prescribed psychotropic drugs lithium and Trilafon at the Cobb County jail. Sikes\n\nnoted, too, that Plaintiff had related a long history of intravenous use of cocaine as well\n\nas heavy alcohol consumption. His report states that the intermittent anxiety and\n\npsychiatric hospitalizations in Weathers’s report appeared to arise from complications\n\nwith drugs and medication. Moreover, Sikes noted that Plaintiff denied having any\n\nschizophrenic episodes, auditory hallucinations, or delusional thoughts.\n\n\n\n                                            5\n                                            5\n\f      At the meeting with Plaintiff, Sikes observed Plaintiff’s current condition. He\n\nfound her to be calm and cooperative. He saw no evidence of delusional thought or\n\nloosening of associations. After meeting with Plaintiff and reviewing Weathers’s\n\nreport, Sikes directed that Plaintiff’s Trilafon be discontinued.\n\n      Sikes scheduled a follow-up session with Plaintiff for July 1 in order to observe\n\nher behavior once she had been off Trilafon for a few weeks. Sikes’s report from that\n\nmeeting notes the absence of any reported problems up to that point. The report also\n\nstates that at the interview, Plaintiff told Sikes she had experienced trouble sleeping\n\nand “what she consider[ed] as normal adjustment to the prison.” Sikes suggested\n\nincreased activity but reported “no evidence of a schizophrenic illness.”\n\n      Sikes met with Campbell again on August 12. His reports from that meeting\n\nindicate he diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from polysubstance abuse arising from her\n\nprior alcohol and drug abuse. Sikes also noted that Plaintiff was “angry and resentful\n\nof being called up to talk about things” and that she would probably “continue to clash\n\nwith authoritative figures.” His thoughts on Plaintiff’s condition remained unchanged:\n\n“I see no indication of schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder and will continue to see her\n\nas needed should further concerns occur.” Sikes found no indications of schizophrenia\n\n(a thought disorder) or bipolar disorder (a mood disorder) because Plaintiff showed “no\n\nlooseness of associations, no evidence of delusional thought”; he explained, “this\n\n\n                                           6\n                                           6\n\fseems to be a failure to adjust to the conditions of incarceration rather than a presence\n\nof a psychiatric illness.” Sikes concluded that psychotropic medication should not be\n\nprescribed absent a diagnosis of mental illness. According to Sikes’s reports, he did\n\nnot prescribe psychotropic medication because he diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from\n\npolysubstance abuse and not a mental illness.\n\n      Sikes and other mental health professionals met with Plaintiff numerous times\n\nin the months ahead. Sikes himself saw Plaintiff sixteen times: June 3, July 1, August\n\n12, September 4 or 6, 18, 20, 23, 25, and 30, October 9 and 25, November 1, 8, and 25,\n\nDecember 6, and January 29. In mid-September, when Plaintiff’s behavior began to\n\ndeteriorate, Sikes reported, “It appears that this woman ‘acts strangely’ to get attention\n\nor perhaps to earn additional privileges or perhaps to avoid prosecution for her various\n\ndisciplinaries.” He recommended establishment and enforcement of clear rules in\n\norder to aid Plaintiff in learning to respect and obey authority. Sikes was confident of\n\nPlaintiff’s capability to conform her behavior to institutional rules. He thus explained,\n\n“She has a temper as many inmates do but she should be held accountable for whatever\n\nrules she breaks.” During each meeting with Plaintiff, Sikes continued to find no\n\nevidence of a psychiatric illness justifying treatment with medication.\n\n      Other members of the mental health staff also met with Campbell and reached\n\nsimilar conclusions. Plaintiff was placed on the caseload of mental health counselor\n\n\n                                            7\n                                            7\n\fValarie Ford. Ford met with Plaintiff thirty-four times between August 1991 and\n\nJanuary 1992: August 1, September 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, and 27, October 10, 14,\n\n15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, and 29, November 4, 6, 13, and 19, December 4, 5,\n\n6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 18, and January 14. Ford reports that she also saw Campbell\n\ninformally almost every day during that time period. According to Ford, from the time\n\nof the first meeting she perceived Campbell’s behavior as manipulative and saw no\n\nevidence of psychosis.\n\n       After her first meeting with Plaintiff, Ford referred Plaintiff to Psychologist Dr.\n\nArcher Moore, who also met with Plaintiff on August 1. Moore’s report from that\n\nmeeting states Plaintiff was “a very angry young woman who denie[d] any thought of\n\nhurting herself.” Moore found “good reality contact” but “strong narcissistic features.”\n\nDuring Plaintiff’s stay at GWCI, Moore saw her six times total, (August 1, September\n\n5, 19, 26, and October 10 and 14), and he believed she suffered from a “Narcissistic\n\nPersonality Disorder” and not a mental illness but stressed that he considered Plaintiff\n\nto be primarily Sikes’s patient.\n\n       No one on the GWCI staff ever diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from bipolar\n\ndisorder or prescribed psychotropic medications. Instead, the GWCI staff attributed\n\nPlaintiff’s behavior to the lingering effects of her prior substance abuse, the difficulties\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n                                             8\n\fof adjusting to life in prison, and, on some occasions, deliberate attempts to manipulate\n\nofficials.\n\nB.     Restraints\n\n       During June, July, and August 1991, Plaintiff was sanctioned a few times for\n\nminor disciplinary infractions. In September 1991, however, Plaintiff began engaging\n\nin defiant behavior that eventually became violent, self-destructive, and even suicidal.\n\nOn several occasions, she thrashed about her cell, climbed up on the sink, ripped her\n\nsheets to shreds, beat on and dismantled the overhead light, and attempted to obtain\n\nsharp objects. Plaintiff also bit and scratched prison officials and threatened to “hurt\n\nsomeone.” Plaintiff often threatened to flood the toilet, which posed a security risk\n\nbecause it could mandate evacuation of other cells in the unit. In addition, Plaintiff\n\nstarted multiple fires in her cell, burning her food tray, her Bible, her clothing, and\n\nother such items. One clothing fire she started caused her entire cellblock to be\n\nevacuated.\n\n       Prison officials responded by removing potentially harmful belongings,\n\ninstituting terms of solitary confinement, and restraining Plaintiff using several forms\n\nof restraint.   Officials gradually increased the level of restraint.        They used\n\nstraightjackets on several occasions, which made Plaintiff’s hands unusable but left her\n\nable to walk around the cell. On at least one occasion when officials used only a\n\n\n                                           9\n                                           9\n\fstraightjacket, Plaintiff began banging her head and kicking. When Plaintiff’s behavior\n\nescalated, officials also used “four-point restraints” at least five times, anchoring each\n\nof her arms and legs to a different point on the bed.\n\n      Throughout her stay at GWCI, Plaintiff demonstrated an uncanny ability to\n\nescape from most forms of restraint. She removed her straightjacket on numerous\n\noccasions, and at least once, she freed herself from four-point restraints.\n\n      Plaintiff’s complaint, however, focuses mainly on the instances in which\n\nofficials employed a third method of restraint that left her in an “L” shape3 with her\n\nknees bent so that her calves were perpendicular to her back. To use this form of\n\nrestraint, officials first immobilized Plaintiff’s hands and arms using either a\n\nstraightjacket or handcuffs behind her back. Next, they put handcuffs on her ankles.\n\nFinally, they used a strap that ran the length from the handcuffs on her ankles up to the\n\nhandcuffs on her wrists. This left Plaintiff in an “L” shape, with her body from her\n\nhead to her knees defining the vertical part of the “L” and the lower portion of her\n\nlegs–from her knees along her calves to her feet–defining the horizontal portion of the\n\n“L.” This “L” shape restraint would have resulted in Plaintiff’s being in a kneeling\n\nposition had she been left upright. Most of the time, she was lying on her side with the\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        Plaintiff calls it “hog-tying,” and Defendants call it “tethering.” We refer to it as the\n“L” shape method of restraint.\n                                                10\n                                                10\n\f“L” shape on a plane parallel to the ground. On at least one occasion, Plaintiff freed\n\nherself from the leg tether while this “L” shape form of restraint was being used.\n\n      Although Plaintiff entered GWCI in May 1991, Sikes first ordered Plaintiff\n\nrestrained using this “L” shape method on September 18, 1991. On September 17,\n\nPlaintiff was observed standing on the bed with a sheet wrapped around the back of her\n\nneck. Believing Plaintiff might be trying to commit suicide, mental health staff\n\nremoved her clothing and other belongings, placed her in seclusion, conducted security\n\nchecks every fifteen minutes, and monitored her condition using a camera.\n\n      The next morning, Plaintiff was sent to Sikes for evaluation. She yelled at Sikes,\n\nturned over a table, and broke a phone. When Plaintiff was returned to seclusion and\n\nordered to strip in front of male guards, she refused. Upon a second request, she\n\ncomplied but began running around the cell, kicking and butting the wall. Officials\n\nthen contacted Sikes, who ordered Plaintiff placed in a straightjacket, which\n\nimmobilized her hands and arms. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff began banging her head\n\nand kicking. When informed of this behavior, Sikes ordered that Plaintiff be placed\n\nin a helmet and that the “L” shape restraint be employed. This immobilized her legs\n\nas well as her arms, preventing her from jumping, climbing, kicking, and running\n\naround the cell.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n                                          11\n\f      Between September 18 and October 28, officials restrained Plaintiff using this\n\n“L” shape method five times.4 In addition to the twenty-seven hours on September 18\n\nto 19, the “L” shape restraints were applied for about one hour and twenty-five minutes\n\non September 22, five hours on October 12 to 13, sixteen hours on October 23 to 24,\n\nand sixty-six hours and forty minutes on October 25 to 28.5\n\n      Although the restraints undoubtedly caused physical discomfort and emotional\n\npain, they undisputedly caused Plaintiff no physical injury. It is also undisputed that\n\nofficials monitored Plaintiff’s physical condition while she was restrained. Plaintiff’s\n\ncirculation was checked each time the “L” shape method of restraint was applied, and\n\nsecurity officers checked her every fifteen minutes while she was restrained. Medical\n\nstaff also provided regular checks; a nurse assessed Plaintiff’s condition every few\n\nhours, and a doctor reevaluated the need for restraints every twenty-four hours.\n\n       4\n         Plaintiff actually alleges “at least five times.” Undisputed facts include five clear\ninstances of the “L” shape restraint and other times when the exact type of restraint used is\nunclear.\n       5\n          Although we describe only the first use of the “L”shape restraint, the magistrate judge’s\norder details all five occurrences and Plaintiff’s violent and often self-destructive behavior\nprecipitating the use of the “L” shape restraint. The approximate periods of the “L” shape\nrestraint are (1) from 10:05 a.m. on September 18 to 1:05 p.m. on September 19; (2) from 10:20\np.m. to 11:45 p.m. on September 22; (3) from 9:45 p.m. on October 12 to 2:45 a.m. on October\n13; (4) from 10:05 p.m. on October 23 to 2:15 p.m. on October 24; (5) from 3:30 p.m. on\nOctober 25 to 10:10 a.m. on October 28.\n\n         During these periods of restraint, Campbell was reevaluated every twenty-four hours and\nleft in restraints only if her self-injurious inclinations were still apparent. For example, restraints\nwere continued during the longest (almost 67-hour) period of restraint because Campbell\nthreatened to drink Clorox if the restraints were removed.\n                                                 12\n                                                 12\n\f      On at least two occasions, Defendant Sikes declined to approve restraints\n\nrequested by other officials. Plaintiff admits that on each of these occasions, Sikes\n\nexplained to the requesting officers that restraints were inappropriate when Plaintiff did\n\nnot pose an immediate threat to her own safety.\n\n      Although used five times between September 19 and October 28, the “L” shape\n\nrestraints were not used during November and December 1991 or January 1992.\n\nPlaintiff asserts the “L” shape restraints were discontinued because a prison deputy\n\ncommissioner had issued an edict proscribing “hogtying.”\n\nC.    Outside Evaluations\n\n      In December 1991, Plaintiff requested to be taken off the mental health caseload.\n\nThe staff conferred and determined that Plaintiff did not have an Axis I diagnosis and\n\nthat she would still have a counselor and access to mental health services as needed in\n\nthe general population. Thus, they granted her request and reassigned her to the\n\ngeneral population on December 31.\n\n      On January 28, 1992, Plaintiff was placed in four-point restraints for setting four\n\nfires and breaking the lights in her cell. On January 29, Plaintiff wrapped torn strips\n\nfrom her jumpsuit around her neck in an attempted suicide. The next day officials sent\n\nher to a forensic mental health unit at Central State Hospital for additional psychiatric\n\n\n\n\n                                           13\n                                           13\n\fevaluation. Doctors there diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from bipolar disorder and\n\nprescribed the psychotropic medications lithium and Mellaril.\n\n      Plaintiff was returned to GWCI for the remainder of her incarceration. Because\n\nSikes was no longer working at GWCI, Plaintiff was evaluated by Dr. Richard Panico,\n\nwho had just begun working as a part-time consulting psychiatrist at GWCI. Dr.\n\nPanico diagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium.\n\n      Plaintiff was paroled in March 1993. After her release, Plaintiff was admitted\n\nto Georgia Regional Hospital in February 1994. The Georgia Regional Hospital\n\nrecords indicate that the February admission was due to “a serious overdose on\n\nlithium” and that Plaintiff had “a past history of suicidal threats.”\n\n      Plaintiff was admitted again to Georgia Regional Hospital for reevaluation and\n\ntreatment on April 28, 1994. At this admission, psychological testing was done to aid\n\nin evaluating Plaintiff. The Georgia Regional Hospital records reveal that Plaintiff was\n\ndiagnosed as presenting a “personality disorder,” “with borderline anti-social features,\n\nand an Axis I diagnosis of alcohol and substance abuse.” At Georgia Regional\n\nHospital, the treating psychiatrist specifically noted that “Plaintiff did not present an\n\nAxis I diagnosis of bipolar disorder.”\n\n                           II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.    Complaint\n\n\n                                           14\n                                           14\n\f      Plaintiff filed a complaint in state court in nine counts: (1) a § 1983 claim for\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs; (2) a § 1983 claim for cruel and\n\nunusual punishment through use of stripping, restraint, and isolation; (3) a § 1983\n\nclaim for excessive force; (4) a § 1983 substantive-due-process claim for punishment\n\nin lieu of treatment; (5) a § 1983 claim alleging infringements of Plaintiff’s procedural-\n\ndue-process and First Amendment rights; (6) a claim under the Georgia Tort Claims\n\nAct (“GTCA”) for medical and professional negligence; (7) a GTCA claim for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress; (8) a GTCA claim for neligence and\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress against Sikes and Moore as independent\n\ncontractors; and (9) a claim alleging violations of the Georgia Constitution and a\n\nGeorgia statute regarding types of punishment. The five defendants in Plaintiff’s\n\ninitial complaint were the Georgia Department of Corrections (“GDOC”), Mental\n\nHealth Director Albert Duncan, Psychiatrist James Sikes, Psychologist Archer Moore,\n\nand Warden Art Gavin.\n\n      Defendants removed to federal court in the Northern District of Georgia. In\n\nfederal court, Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint, which incorporates the claims\n\nin the initial complaint and adds Mental Health Counselor Valarie Ford as a Defendant.\n\nThe district court granted Plaintiff’s motion to amend.\n\n\n\n\n                                           15\n                                           15\n\f      The district court also granted in part Plaintiff’s motion to remand to state court,\n\nremanding all claims against the GDOC and any official-capacity claims against\n\nDuncan, Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford. Thus, remaining in federal court were\n\nPlaintiff’s individual-capacity claims against Duncan, Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford.\n\nB.    Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n      After Defendants’ motion for a transfer to the federal court in the Middle District\n\nof Georgia was granted, the parties consented to proceeding before a magistrate judge\n\nand began discovery. Defendants filed separate motions for summary judgment,\n\narguing Plaintiff had failed to allege a constitutional violation and asserting qualified\n\nimmunity.\n\nC.    Magistrate Judge’s Order\n\n      On January 28, 1998, the magistrate judge issued an order (1) granting\n\nDefendants Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford summary judgment based on qualified\n\nimmunity on all five of Plaintiff’s § 1983 claims; (2) granting those Defendants\n\nsummary judgment on any Georgia Tort Claims Act claims still in federal court; and\n\n(3) with Plaintiff’s consent, dismissing Duncan as an improper party.\n\nD.    Scope of This Appeal\n\n      Plaintiff’s appeal challenges only the magistrate judge’s grant of summary\n\njudgment on her § 1983 claims against Defendants Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford.\n\n\n                                           16\n                                           16\n\fPlaintiff does not appeal the dismissal of Defendant Duncan or the grant of summary\n\njudgment for Defendants on any Georgia Tort Claims Act claims remaining in federal\n\ncourt. Plaintiff also abandons certain constitutional violations alleged in her first\n\namended complaint. She primarily focuses on two distinct alleged violations of the\n\nEighth Amendment: (1) Defendants’ deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,\n\nand (2) Defendants’ excessive force.\n\n      Thus, on appeal, we discuss whether the magistrate judge erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment for Defendants Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford on Plaintiff’s §\n\n1983 claims for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs and for use of\n\nexcessive force.6\n\n    III. REVIEW OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT BASED ON QUALIFIED\n                         IMMUNITY\n\n      We review the magistrate judge's grant of summary judgment de novo. Steele\n\nv.

In doing so, we “evaluate the summary\n\njudgment record in the light most favorable to . . . the nonmovant,” and we will affirm\n\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment only if the record demonstrates that\n\nthere was no genuine issue of material fact and that Defendants were entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n\n\n       6\n         To the extent that Plaintiff appeals other claims and issues, we find no reversible error\nin the decision of the magistrate judge. See 11th Cir. Rule 36-1.\n\n                                                17\n                                                17\n\f      The magistrate judge’s order and the parties’ briefs focus almost exclusively on\n\nqualified immunity and the question of whether, at the time of Defendants’ actions, the\n\nlaw clearly established that Plaintiff’s rights were being violated. We turn first to an\n\nalternate basis for summary judgment, inquiring whether this record contains any\n\nevidence of an underlying constitutional violation. Because Plaintiff’s evidence would\n\nnot support a reasonable jury’s finding that Defendants violated Plaintiff’s\n\nconstitutional rights, we need not address the applicability of qualified immunity.

Thus, we address each claim\n\nin turn.\n\n   V. “DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE” TO SERIOUS MEDICAL NEEDS\n\n       The Eighth Amendment’s proscription of cruel and unusual punishments\n\nprohibits prison officials from exhibiting deliberate indifference to prisoners’ serious\n\nmedical needs. Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 (1976). The Supreme Court has\n\nbeen careful to note, however, that “a complaint that a physician has been negligent in\n\n\n                                          20\n                                          20\n\fdiagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical\n\nmistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.” Id. at 106. Thus, in Estelle v. Gamble,\n\nwhich first enunciated the “deliberate indifference” standard, the Supreme Court\n\nreinstated the district court’s dismissal of a prisoner’s § 1983 complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim. Noting that the complaint’s primary allegation was that “more should\n\nhave been done” to diagnose and treat a back injury, the Court explained, “A medical\n\ndecision not to order an X-ray, or like measures, does not represent cruel and unusual\n\npunishment. At most it is medical malpractice.” Id. at 107.\n\n      Subsequent Supreme Court cases have refined the inquiry. In Wilson v. Seiter,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), the Supreme Court explained that the Eighth Amendment applies\n\nonly to punishments and that prison conditions are only punishment if a mental element\n\nof punitive intent is shown:\n\n      The source of the intent requirement is not the predilections of this Court,\n      but the Eighth Amendment itself, which bans only cruel and unusual\n      punishment. If the pain inflicted is not formally meted out as punishment\n      by the statute or the sentencing judge, some mental element must be\n      attributed to the inflicting officer before it can qualify.\n\nId. at 300. Although the very imposition of a certain term in prison is punitive, the\n\npunitive purpose of the sentence itself does not convert every attribute of the place of\n\nincarceration into a punishment subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny. Thus,\n\nconditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment only if they (1) rise to the\n\n\n                                           21\n                                           21\n\flevel of a “serious” deprivation; and (2) result from the official’s “deliberate\n\nindifference.” Id. at 297-99. Wilson and subsequent cases refer to these two required\n\nelements as an “objective component” scrutinizing the alleged deprivation and a\n\n“subjective component” examining the official’s mental intent.\n\nA.    Farmer v. Brennan Requires Proof Of Subjective Mental Intent\n\n      Most recently, in Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994), the Supreme Court\n\nexplained further the requisite “subjective component” of a conditions-of-confinement\n\nclaim and defined the exact subjective mental state required for “deliberate\n\nindifference,” as follows:\n\n      [A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment\n      for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the\n      official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or\n      safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference\n      could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must\n      also draw the inference. This approach comports best with the text of the\n      Amendment as our cases have interpreted it. The Eighth Amendment\n      does not outlaw cruel and unusual \"conditions\"; it outlaws cruel and\n      unusual \"punishments.\" An act or omission unaccompanied by\n      knowledge of a significant risk of harm might well be something society\n      wishes to discourage, and if harm does result society might well wish to\n      assure compensation. The common law reflects such concerns when it\n      imposes tort liability on a purely objective basis. But an official's failure\n      to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not,\n      while no cause for commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned\n      as the infliction of punishment.\n\nId. at 837-38 (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted). Thus, in light of Farmer,\n\nliability may be imposed for deliberate indifference only if the plaintiff proves the\n\n                                           22\n                                           22\n\fdefendant actually knew of “an excessive risk to inmate health or safety” and\n\ndisregarded that risk. Id. at 837. Proof that the defendant should have perceived the\n\nrisk, but did not, is insufficient. Id. at 838; Cottrell v.

Thus, the official must have a subjectively “‘sufficiently culpable state of\n\nmind.’” Cottrell, 85 F.3d at 1491 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834).

The plaintiff had been prescribed psychotropic medications\n\nat a previous institution. Id. at 1267. When the plaintiff was transferred to a new\n\nprison, the defendant, Dr. Shah, saw the plaintiff for “less than one minute” and\n\ndiscontinued psychotropic medications. Id. Shah did not review any medical records\n\nother than the Treatment Plan listing medications prescribed by the prior institution,\n\nand he did not consult with any medical staff. Id. After Shah discontinued the\n\nplaintiff’s medication, medical staff from the prior institution wrote the new prison\n\nexpressing concern that the plaintiff was a suicide risk, had been on psychotropic\n\nmedication, and was not now receiving his medication. Id. at 1268. Their letters\n\nclarified that the plaintiff had been diagnosed as having “Adjustment Disorder with\n\nAnxious Mood,” needed psychotropic medication, had tried suicide twice, and was\n\nconsidered a suicide risk. Id. at 1267-68. Still, Shah did not respond; the plaintiff\n\ncontinued without psychotropic medication for the duration of his time at the new\n\nprison.

The Court continued that a jury could further find that Shah\n\n“‘knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious,’” that Shah\n\n“deliberately disregarded that risk,” and that Shah “was aware from Polk personnel that\n\nSteele was considered by them to be a potential suicide risk, and that that was one basis\n\nfor their prescription of the psychotropic drugs.” Id. (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n842).\n\n        The Steele Court noted that this circuit’s two most directly relevant precedents\n\nboth pre-dated Farmer. Id. at 1269 n.2 (citing Greason v.

However, the Steele\n\nCourt found that Farmer did not necessarily affect the holdings in those two pre-Farmer\n\ncases, stating “Greason (surely) and Waldrop (almost as surely) based their specific\n\nholdings on the existence of evidence of subjective awareness.” Id. We understand\n\nSteele’s equivocation about Waldrop’s holding because Waldrop discusses only what\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n                                           25\n\fa reasonable person would have known–an objective test.9 However, we do examine\n\nGreason in detail because Steele relies so heavily on Greason.10\n\n      In Greason, the inmate’s prior therapist at Gwinnett County Mental Health\n\nCenter had sent a letter to the prison doctor describing the inmate’s current mental\n\nstatus, relating his history of mental illness, and noting that he had been hospitalized\n\nthirteen times and diagnosed as a “schizophrenic” with suicidal tendencies. Id. at 831-\n\n32. The therapist urged continuation of the inmate’s medication for his diagnosed\n\nmental illness and close monitoring. Id. The inmate’s psychiatrist at the Georgia\n\nDepartment of Human Resources also sent a letter reporting that the inmate continued\n\n\n       9\n          Waldrop never addresses whether there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to\nfind the defendants knew their case was grossly inadequate. Instead, Waldrop inquires whether\nthere is evidence that the defendants’ actions were grossly incompetent and violated professional\nstandards, and it focuses on what a reasonable person in the defendants’ position would have\nknown. Waldrop, 871 F.2d at1034-36. Thus, Steele was correct in hesitating to rely on\nWaldrop’s assessment of the evidence now that Farmer has clarified the subjective-intent\nrequirement. Steele, 87 F.3d at 1269 n.2. Like the Steele Court, we focus instead on Greason.\n       10\n            We question Steele’s characterization of Greason as basing its holding on evidence of\nsubjective awareness. Greason is a pre-Farmer case that does not purport to apply the Farmer\nsubjective prong. Instead, Greason examines the evidence of deliberate indifference in the\ncontext of an objective qualified immunity analysis. Although Greason does state, “we believe\nthat a trier of fact could find that Dr. Fodor provided such care [grossly inadequate psychiatric\ncare] and, moreover, that he realized that he was doing so at the time,” id. at 835, the ultimate\nholding in Greason is that “a jury could find (1) that Dr. Fodor provided grossly inadequate care\nand (2) that a reasonable person in Dr. Fodor’s position would have known that the care\ndelivered constituted deliberate indifference to Greason’s Eighth Amendment rights.” Id.\n(emphasis supplied).\n         Nonetheless, we are not required to resolve whether Steele correctly characterizes\nGreason’s holding, the precedential effect of Steele’s statements about and reliance on pre-\nFarmer Greason, or whether the facts of Greason would have met the Farmer test because, in any\nevent, Greason’s facts are readily distinguishable from those in this case.\n\n                                              26\n                                              26\n\fto have suicidal thoughts and needed to be maintained on his medication. Id. at 832.\n\nBoth letter reports were in the inmate’s clinical file. Id.\n\n      Two and a half months after the inmate’s arrival, the prison psychiatrist saw him\n\nfor a few minutes, promptly concluded that his condition had stabilized, and\n\ndiscontinued his medications without reviewing the clinical file or assessing his mental\n\nstatus to determine his potential for suicide. About a month later, the psychiatrist saw\n\nthe inmate again for only a few minutes.11 Based on these facts, the Greason Court\n\nfound that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the\n\npsychiatrist provided grossly inadequate medical care “and, moreover, that he realized\n\nthat he was doing so at the time.” Id. at 835 (emphasis supplied).\n\n      The parties also cite other post-Farmer Eleventh Circuit decisions involving\n\ndeliberate indifference to an arrestee’s or an inmate’s non-psychiatric medical needs.\n\nSee, e.g., Lancaster v.

Plaintiff’s Contentions\n\n      We now apply the teachings of Farmer, Steele, and Greason to this case.\n\nPlaintiff contends that Defendants’ medical care was grossly inadequate and that\n\nDefendants knew their care was grossly inadequate. According to Plaintiff, the\n\nmedical care Defendants provided was grossly inadequate because Defendants\n\nmisdiagnosed her as having a polysubstance abuse disorder when they knew or should\n\nhave known she had bipolar disorder, discontinued medication that would have treated\n\nher bipolar disorder, improperly used behavior modification techniques, and waited\n\n\n       13\n          The parties also cite this Court’s post-Farmer decisions in Dolihite v. Maughon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70592\"><a href=\"/opinion/70592/dolihite-v-maughon/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1996), and Hale v.

Instead, the majority opinion in Dolihite addresses only the objective\nprong of qualified immunity–whether “a reasonable professional in defendant’s shoes would\nhave known that his challenged actions (or inaction) violated plaintiff’s constitutional rights.”\nId. at 1046.\n        In Hale, the plaintiff arrestee sued for damages arising from being beaten by other\noccupants of an overcrowded, small “bullpen” with detainees not segregated based on proclivity\nfor violence or reasons for confinement. 50 F.3d at 1580-81. The case turned on whether\ndefendants knew about the significant risk of inmate-on-inmate violence but knowingly\ndisregarded that risk and kept the plaintiff arrestee in that bullpen. Id. at 1582-84. The Court\nstressed the evidence that officials admitted knowing that inmate-on-inmate violence occurred in\nthat overcrowded “bullpen” on a regular basis and resulted in injuries requiring medical\ntreatment. Id. at 1583.\n\n                                                29\n                                                29\n\feight months before sending her outside the prison for diagnostic tests. Plaintiff also\n\nsubmits expert testimony stating Defendants’ medical care was grossly inadequate,\n\nwhile Defendants’ experts state Defendants complied with the applicable standard of\n\ncare.\n\n        After review, we agree with the magistrate judge that Plaintiff has presented\n\ninsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that Defendants knew that she had\n\nbipolar disorder, that Defendants knew they had misdiagnosed her as suffering from\n\npolysubstance abuse rather than bipolar disorder, or that Defendants otherwise knew\n\ntheir treatment was grossly inadequate but proceeded with the treatment anyway.\n\nWithout evidence to establish the subjective mental intent prong of deliberate\n\nindifference, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment under Farmer. We address\n\nPlaintiff’s evidence against each Defendant in turn.\n\nD.      Defendant Sikes\n\n        Defendant Sikes is a psychiatrist who worked part time at GWCI. Sikes first met\n\nwith Plaintiff on June 3, 1991, a few days after her transfer to GWCI, and he gave the\n\norder to discontinue her psychotropic medication. Sikes himself saw Plaintiff sixteen\n\ntimes during the eight months before he determined that she needed to go to Central\n\nfor further mental health examination. Sikes was also consulted by mental health staff\n\n\n\n\n                                           30\n                                           30\n\fon numerous other occasions, and he was repeatedly called upon to advise correctional\n\nofficers on how to respond to Plaintiff’s self-destructive behavior.\n\n      Sikes’s liability turns on whether he knew Plaintiff had bipolar disorder, or knew\n\nhe was misdiagnosing Plaintiff, or knew his treatment was otherwise grossly\n\ninadequate but proceeded with the treatment anyway. Sikes’s reports show he\n\ndiagnosed Plaintiff as suffering from polysubstance abuse, and Plaintiff agrees that\n\npsychotropic medication is not proper treatment for polysubstance abuse. Plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint asserts principally that Sikes misdiagnosed her condition, that she had\n\nbipolar disorder rather than merely suffering from polysubstance abuse, that her\n\nbehavior made it obvious that she had bipolar disorder, and that Sikes should have\n\nknown both that she was bipolar and that medication was the proper treatment for\n\nbipolar disorder. In addition, Plaintiff argues any treatment she did receive was both\n\ngrossly inadequate and detrimental to her bipolar condition.\n\n      1.     Facts Regarding Sikes’s Treatment\n\n      Sikes is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s deliberate-indifference\n\nclaim because Plaintiff failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could\n\ninfer that Sikes knew she had bipolar disorder, or knew he was misdiagnosing Plaintiff,\n\nor knew his treatment was otherwise grossly inadequate but proceeded with the\n\ntreatment anyway. See Steele, 87 F.3d at 1269; Greason, 891 F.2d at 835. Turning\n\n\n                                          31\n                                          31\n\ffirst to the initial diagnosis and discontinuation of medication, the undisputed evidence\n\nshows that Sikes discontinued Plaintiff’s medication only after Sikes personally\n\ninterviewed Plaintiff and reviewed a three-page report by Weathers, who had\n\nperformed an extensive review of Plaintiff’s history and symptoms.14 It is also\n\nundisputed that Sikes, unlike the psychiatrists in Steele and Greason, conducted\n\nmultiple follow-up sessions and observed Plaintiff’s behavior repeatedly once she was\n\noff medication; altogether, he met with Campbell sixteen times. Moreover, Weathers’s\n\nreport revealed the Cobb County jail told Weathers that Campbell’s suicidal threats\n\nmight be an attempt to manipulate officials as they were reducing her medication. In\n\nstark contrast, the professionals previously responsible for the plaintiff inmates in\n\nSteele and Greason stressed the inmates’ suicidal tendencies and prior psychiatric\n\ndiagnoses and urged continued medication.\n\n      Plaintiff faults Sikes for not obtaining and reviewing her actual medical records\n\nfrom the Cobb County jail or her prior thirteen hospitalizations as a juvenile.\n\nHowever, Sikes reviewed (a) Weathers’s detailed summary of Weathers’s\n\ncommunications with the Cobb County jail, which included an account of Campbell’s\n\nsymptoms and treatment at the jail, and (b) Weathers’s summary of Plaintiff’s personal\n\n\n       14\n          Sikes says he also performed an independent review of Plaintiff’s history, but Plaintiff\ndisputes that. We thus rely only on Sikes’s personal interview of Campbell and his review of\nWeathers’s report.\n\n                                               32\n                                               32\n\fhistory, which included an account of mental health problems as a juvenile and a prior\n\nhospitalization.   Moreover, the jail records and prior hospitalization records\n\nthemselves, which are in evidence in this case, contain no diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n\n      Plaintiff also points to the fact that Sikes did know she was prescribed Trilafon\n\nand lithium while at the Cobb County jail, which she says should have put Sikes on\n\nnotice she had bipolar disorder. However, the Cobb records themselves show Plaintiff\n\nwas placed on Trilafon and lithium without indicating a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n\nIndeed, in an affidavit, Dr. Youngleson, who prescribed the medication at the jail,\n\ntestifies (1) that Plaintiff was never given any diagnosis while at the jail; (2) that\n\nlooking back, he believes Plaintiff suffered from a personality disorder rather than\n\nbipolar disorder; and (3) that Plaintiff’s threats and self-destructive behavior seemed\n\nmanipulative. The jail records also show Cobb County jail officials’ concerns that\n\nPlaintiff might be “running a game on us” and acting out to manipulate officials.\n\n      Sikes’s ongoing medical treatment is also readily distinguishable from that in\n\nSteele and Greason, where the psychiatrists basically did nothing to treat the inmates\n\nafter discontinuing their medication.

In stark contrast, Sikes spent a great deal of time and effort working\n\n\n                                           33\n                                           33\n\fwith Plaintiff.

Such\n\nactions readily distinguish Sikes’s care from the deliberate indifference in Steele and\n\nGreason.16\n\n      2.      Expert Testimony\n\n      Lacking direct or circumstantial factual evidence to establish or to allow a jury\n\nto infer Sikes’s knowledge, Plaintiff attempts to create a factual issue regarding Sikes’s\n\nmental intent by submitting opinion testimony by medical experts. In affidavits and\n\ndepositions, Plaintiff’s experts testify that given Plaintiff’s prior hospitalizations and\n\nmedication and her symptoms and behavior, Sikes should have known that Plaintiff\n\nhad bipolar disorder and needed medication and that Sikes’s treatment was grossly\n\ninadequate.

Plaintiff’s experts’ opinion\n\ntestimony directly contradicts that of Defendants’ experts.\n\n      The question becomes whether the opinion testimony by Plaintiff’s experts here\n\ncreates a jury issue regarding Defendants’ subjective mental intent required by Farmer.\n\nMore specifically, the issue is this: since the facts and circumstances of this case do not\n\nallow an inference that Sikes not only should have perceived the risk but also actually\n\ndid perceive it, does the opinion testimony by Plaintiff’s medical experts based on\n\nthose same facts and circumstances provide the missing Farmer link? The answer is\n\nno.\n\n      We begin by examining our precedent for guidance. This circuit has not\n\ndiscussed directly the precise role of expert testimony in a post-Farmer decision\n\nturning on the subjective mental intent of medical professionals sued for deliberate\n\nindifference to an inmate’s serious psychiatric medical needs. Neither Steele nor\n\nGreason relies on opinion testimony by medical experts as evidence that the\n\npsychiatrist knew his care was grossly inadequate. In Steele the plaintiff presented no\n\nexpert testimony at all,17 and in Greason this Court relied on expert testimony only in\n\n       17\n           Indeed, another issue before the Steele Court was whether the district court had erred\nin refusing to appoint an expert witness to assist the plaintiff. 87 F.3d at 1271. The Court\nremanded for the district court to reconsider appointing an expert, noting that “the appropriate\nstandard of psychiatric care” was at issue and that “[e]xpert opinion on that issue and its\n\n                                               35\n                                               35\n\faddressing the objective prong of deliberate indifference.18 Instead, the egregious facts\n\nand circumstances in those cases created the requisite factual issue of deliberate\n\nindifference or wanton conduct.\n\n      The parties rely heavily on this Court’s treatment of expert affidavits in Dolihite\n\nv. Maughon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70592\"><a href=\"/opinion/70592/dolihite-v-maughon/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1996). However, like Greason, Dolihite\n\nconsiders expert medical affidavits only in relation to the objective inquiry of qualified\n\nimmunity–whether a reasonable medical professional in the defendants’ position would\n\nhave known that the defendants’ actions violated the juvenile’s constitutional rights.19\n\nDolihite acknowledges that in the unique context of a claim of deliberate indifference\n\nto medical needs, expert testimony is relevant to ascertaining the applicability of\n\nqualified immunity:\n\n      Our circuit has indicated that the testimony of medical experts can aid the\n      court in determining whether qualified immunity is appropriate where\n\napplication here obviously might be important to the finder of fact.” Id.; see also Young v. City\nof Augusta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70300\"><a href=\"/opinion/70300/young-v-augusta-georgia-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1169-70 (11th Cir. 1995) (upholding the district court’s decision not\nto appoint an expert to assist plaintiff Young because “[t]he presence of a genuine issue of fact\nwith respect to deliberate indifference to Young’s medical needs is apparent from the face of the\nrecord” without any expert testimony).\n       18\n          Greason relies on expert testimony in listing what the defendant psychiatrist would\nhave known had he reviewed the inmate’s file before discontinuing medication: there was\ntestimony by a psychiatrist “that Greason possessed a great number of the characteristics\nassociated with a high suicide risk.” 891 F.2d at 835 n.11. It also relies on expert testimony\n“that Greason received grossly inadequate care,” and it reaffirms a past case’s holding that “the\nconflict among the experts concerning the propriety of the psychiatrist’s professional judgment\ncalls [must] be resolved by the jury.” Greason, 891 F.2d at 835.\n       19\n            See footnote 13 supra.\n\n                                               36\n                                               36\n\f      allegations hinge upon the appropriateness of the actions of medical\n      professionals, including mental health professionals.\n\nId. at 1046. Dolihite does not address the role of expert testimony in determining\n\nwhether a plaintiff has sufficient evidence of the subjective mental intent required for\n\na jury finding of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs under Farmer.\n\nIndeed, the majority opinion in Dolihite does not even cite Farmer. Moreover,\n\nDolihite’s explanation for considering expert testimony is particular to the objective\n\nqualified immunity inquiry:\n\n      Such expert medical testimony, making reference to specific deficiencies\n      in a defendant’s treatment and specific medically accepted standards\n      might, in conjunction with the specific facts of a case, persuade a court\n      that the medical defendant’s actions in the case were clearly as great a\n      departure from appropriate medical standards as previous departures\n      found unconstitutional in prior cases–i.e., might persuade a court that a\n      reasonable professional in defendant’s shoes would have known that his\n      challenged actions (or inaction) violated plaintiff’s constitutional rights.\n\nId. at 1046. Thus, Dolihite’s consideration of expert testimony in applying qualified\n\nimmunity’s objective standard does not answer our question about the role of expert\n\nopinion testimony when applying Farmer’s subjective-intent requirement.\n\n      In two other conditions-of-confinement cases since Farmer, the plaintiffs failed\n\nto create triable issues regarding the defendants’ subjective mental intent. Each\n\nopinion lends support to our ultimate conclusion regarding expert testimony, but\n\nadmittedly neither is squarely on point here. In Cottrell v. Caldwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71001\"><a href=\"/opinion/71001/cottrell-v-caldwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n                                          37\n                                          37\n\f(11th Cir. 1996), this Court held that the plaintiff’s expert affidavit regarding what\n\n“was well known by police” was insufficient to create a jury issue regarding Farmer’s\n\nsubjective component. Id. at 1491. The Court explained that “such a conclusory\n\nstatement about police in general is not evidence about the mental state of these\n\ndefendant officers in particular.” Id. Although helpful guidance on the role of expert\n\ntestimony, Cottrell does not fully answer the question here for two reasons. First,\n\nCottrell involves expert affidavits about police officers’ positioning and restraining\n\narrestees in police cars, as opposed to expert medical testimony. Also, Cottrell appears\n\nto rely in part on the conclusory nature of the affidavits, and not all the testimony\n\nPlaintiff presents in this case is so conclusory.\n\n       Similarly, in Adams v. Poag, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70352\"><a href=\"/opinion/70352/adams-v-poag/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1543-48 (11th Cir. 1995), this Court\n\nexamined the plaintiff’s expert testimony and found it failed to create a triable issue\n\nregarding the defendants’ subjective intent. However, as noted above, Adams is\n\nframed in terms of qualified immunity and does not cite Farmer.20 Moreover, Adams,\n\ntoo, seems to rest on particular deficiencies in the wording of the affidavits at\n\nissue–deficiencies that are present in a great deal of, but not all, the testimony Plaintiff\n\nrelies on in this case.\n\n\n\n\n       20\n            See footnote 12 supra.\n\n                                            38\n                                            38\n\f      Lastly, in Hale v. Tallapoosa County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1995), a post-\n\nFarmer inmate-on-inmate violence case, we considered experts’ opinions, but only\n\nwhere other factual evidence showed the defendant sheriff’s actual knowledge.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, we found a triable issue as to whether the defendant\n\npossessed the subjective mental intent required by Farmer. Id. at 1583. Importantly,\n\nhowever, our finding of a factual issue did not rest on expert testimony alone.\n\nAlthough we noted the expert’s testimony that “given the conditions in the months\n\npreceding [the attack], it was plainly foreseeable to a reasonable law enforcement\n\nofficial that a violent attack was likely to occur,” we also stressed the defendant’s own\n\nadmission “that he knew that inmate-on-inmate violence was occurring on a regular\n\nbasis” and “that he knew the violence sometimes resulted in injuries requiring medical\n\ntreatment.” Id.\n\n      Lacking a controlling application of Farmer’s standard, we turn to Farmer itself.\n\nIn Farmer, the Supreme Court made clear that the subjective mental intent prong\n\nrequires that the official actually know of a substantial risk of serious harm to the\n\ninmate’s health and then disregard that risk. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. An “official’s\n\nfailure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while\n\nno cause for commendation, cannot . . . be condemned as the infliction of punishment.”\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n                                           39\n\fId. at 838. Under Farmer, proof that the defendant should have perceived the risk but\n\ndid not is insufficient. Id. at 838. Farmer also explains:\n\n      When instructing juries in deliberate indifference cases with such issues\n      of proof, courts should be careful to ensure that the requirement of\n      subjective culpability is not lost. It is not enough merely to find that a\n      reasonable person would have known, or that the defendant should have\n      known, and juries should be instructed accordingly.\n\nId. at 843 n.8. Instead, the plaintiff must submit evidence that the medical professional\n\ndefendant actually was aware of the significant risk of serious harm but deliberately\n\nproceeded with grossly inadequate treatment anyway.\n\n      The issue of subjective mental intent under Farmer is different from whether\n\nSikes’s medical treatment was negligent or grossly inadequate. To decide the issue of\n\nsubjective mental intent under Farmer, a jury would inquire (1) whether Sikes was\n\naware of facts about Plaintiff from which he could draw the inference that his present\n\ncourse of treatment presented a substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiff and (2)\n\nwhether he actually drew that inference but persisted in the course of treatment\n\nanyway. There is no direct or circumstantial evidence in this record from which the\n\njury could infer Sikes’s actual knowledge, and Plaintiff’s experts’ testimony does not\n\nprovide the missing link under Farmer–at least under the facts and circumstances of\n\nthis case. Indeed, allowing expert testimony that Sikes should or would have known\n\nto raise a jury issue as to whether he actually knew effectively would nullify Farmer’s\n\n\n                                           40\n                                           40\n\frequirement of subjective mental intent. The deficiency of the expert testimony here\n\narises not necessarily from the specific wording of the experts’ testimony–although\n\nsome of Plaintiff’s affidavits are lacking in many respects21–but from the inherent\n\n\n       21\n          While we do not rely on deficiencies in the wording of the expert affidavits, we do note\na few of their shortcomings. For example, the experts’ testimony contains many conclusory\nstatements that Defendants were deliberately indifferent that do not govern our assessment of the\nevidence. See Dolihite, 74 F.3d at 1046-47 & n.33 (explaining that “an expert opinion which is\nmerely conclusory, even if couched in the language of the relevant legal standard, will be of little\nassistance to a court”); Cottrell, 85 F.3d at 1491 (“[A] conclusory statement about police in\ngeneral is not evidence about the mental state of these defendant officers in particular.”); Rogers\nv. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471409\"><a href=\"/opinion/471409/mr-and-mrs-jl-rogers-etc-v-david-c-evans-leland-q-linahan-mr/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1062 n.9 (11th Cir. 1986) (holding that an affidavit “phrased in\nconclusory terms” was “defective to create a factual dispute”).\n\n       In addition, some of the affidavits rest on false factual predicates. For instance, the\nopinion of James S. Cheatham, M.D., seems to rely in part on the assumption that Plaintiff had\nbeen diagnosed as suffering for bipolar disorder prior to entering GWCI. Neither the Cobb\nCounty jail records nor the other medical records in evidence contain a prior diagnosis of bipolar\ndisorder.\n\n         Also, of the expert affidavits Plaintiff presents, the principal affidavit that opines about\nwhat medical professionals would know is by John R. Paddock, who has a Ph.D. in psychology.\nDr. Paddock reviews the behavior Defendants observed and the treatment they implemented and\nstates, “Any person with professional credentials in the area of mental illness or the treatment of\nmental or emotional disorders would know that what the Defendants were doing was grossly\nimproper in design, approach, and implementation.” In certain areas, such as prescribing\nmedicine, the training of psychologists and psychiatrists is not equivalent; thus, Dr. Paddock is\nnot a competent expert to testify to what a psychiatrist like Sikes would know about the need to\nprescribe medicine.\n\n         Finally, there is the opinion statement of Kenneth I. Robbins, M.D. that Sikes’s own\ntestimony “demonstrates he knew his behavior was improper.” However, Sikes’s testimony\nitself either does or does not prove knowledge. Dr. Robbins’s opinion about what Sikes’s\ntestimony shows is not probative. Moreover, Sikes’s testimony, that Dr. Robbins refers to here,\ndoes not demonstrate that Sikes knew his behavior was improper. What Dr. Robbins is referring\nto here is that Sikes testified restraints were only to be used in limited situations and that Sikes\nleft his patient in restraints over a weekend. Dr. Robbins concludes from Sikes’s testimony\nabout the limited use of restraints that Sikes knew leaving Plaintiff in restraints over a weekend\nwas improper. However, Dr. Robbins fails to note the undisputed evidence that other\npsychiatrists were on call that weekend, that they were available to answer correctional officers’\n\n                                                41\n                                                41\n\fopinion nature of expert testimony about what a person should or would have known.\n\nThe particular conflicting expert testimony here demonstrates only that there is a\n\ndifference of opinion among professionals about what is accepted practice within the\n\npsychiatric community and what a doctor should or would know. Plaintiff’s experts’\n\ntestimony here at best allows an inference by the jury that a doctor should have\n\nperceived the risk of serious harm but not an inference that the doctor actually did\n\nperceive the risk and persisted in his course of treatment anyway.22\n\n\n\nquestions, and that they were called upon every twenty-four hours to reassess the continued need\nfor restraints. Thus, Sikes’s testimony does not create a factual issue regarding Sikes’s\nknowledge that his care was grossly inadequate–nor does Dr. Robbins’s opinion about Sikes’s\ntestimony.\n       22\n          We located one post-Farmer circuit court decision squarely addressing whether expert\nmedical testimony can create a factual issue about subject mental intent in cases involving\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs. In McKee v. Turner, No. 96-3446 (6th Cir.\nAug. 25, 1997), the Sixth Circuit held the defendant psychiatrist was entitled to summary\njudgment because there was no evidence showing that the psychiatrist had acted with deliberate\nindifference. The expert’s affidavit stated that the defendant psychiatrist had departed from\naccepted standards of medical care and that the risk of suicide “must have been obvious” to the\ndefendant psychiatrist. The Sixth Circuit held that this affidavit was insufficient to support a\nfinding of deliberate indifference, stressing that under Farmer, “the official’s conduct is judged\nby what he actually knew, not by what a reasonable person in his shoes would have known.”\nThe Sixth Circuit concluded:\n\n       The issue here is not whether Dr. Morcos committed medical malpractice, but\n       rather whether Dr. Morcos had knowledge or facts about [Plaintiff] from which he\n       could draw the inference that his present course of treatment presented a\n       substantial risk of serious harm to [Plaintiff], and that he actually drew that\n       inference, but persisted in the course of treatment anyway. There is nothing in the\n       record demonstrating this.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also Williams v.

More importantly, the doctor proceeded with no\n\nmedication in the face of warnings from the prior institution that the plaintiff was a\n\nsuicide risk, had tried suicide twice, and needed psychotropic medication. The doctor’s\n\nconduct was similar in Greason: he saw Greason for a few minutes, promptly\n\nconcluded that Greason’s condition had stabilized, and discontinued Greason’s\n\nmedications without reviewing the clinical file or assessing Greason’s mental status to\n\ndetermine his potential for suicide.

Moreover, because\n\nMoore worked at GWCI only one day a week, his duties and responsibilities were\n\n\n\n\n        24\n             On December 7, 1998, Moore’s counsel filed notice that Moore had died on November\n22, 1998.\n\n                                               44\n                                               44\n\fdecided week by week on an as-needed basis. Moore saw Plaintiff six times between\n\nAugust and October 1991. His last contact with Plaintiff was on October 24, 1991.\n\n      Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find\n\nMoore knew that Plaintiff had bipolar disorder or that his treatment was grossly\n\ninadequate. Moore diagnosed Plaintiff as having a personality disorder, as opposed to\n\na mental illness, and Plaintiff has presented no evidence that Moore knew his diagnosis\n\nwas incorrect. Plaintiff’s primary contention is that Moore should have performed\n\npsychological tests even though Sikes did not order them. Again, Plaintiff presents\n\nexpert testimony about Moore’s care, which might establish Moore breached the\n\nstandard of care and was negligent but does not support a finding that Moore knew\n\nPlaintiff was misdiagnosed and needed medication or knew his care was otherwise\n\ninadequate.25 Without evidence of Moore’s subjective intent, Plaintiff’s deliberate-\n\nindifference claim cannot succeed.\n\nF.    Defendant Ford\n\n      Defendant Ford is a mental health counselor, untrained in diagnosing mental\n\nillness and unauthorized to prescribe medication. Plaintiff was assigned to Ford for\n\n\n\n\n       25\n          Some of the expert testimony about Moore’s care seems to rest on the erroneous\nassumption that Moore’s knowledge about Plaintiff was commensurate with Sikes’s. However,\nas with Sikes, we do not rely on particular deficiencies in the affidavits.\n\n                                           45\n                                           45\n\fcounseling during most of the eight-month period in question. Ford had almost daily\n\ncontact with Plaintiff.\n\n      Plaintiff focuses on two alleged deficiencies in the care Ford provided. First,\n\nPlaintiff points to an October 1991 memorandum Ford wrote to prison security\n\npersonnel instructing that they impose maximum disciplinary penalties for Plaintiff’s\n\ninfractions of prison rules. The memorandum states that Plaintiff had received\n\nseventeen prior disciplinary reports, that Plaintiff had been evaluated several times by\n\nDrs. Moore and Sikes, that Plaintiff “does not currently have an Axis I diagnosis,” and\n\nthat therefore “[t]he current treatment goal for Ms. Campbell as recommended by Dr.\n\nSikes and the mental health staff is behavior modification.”\n\n      There is no evidence to support a jury finding that by writing the security\n\nmemorandum Ford was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff’s serious medical needs.\n\nFirst, the memorandum also states that “[m]edical staff will be responsible for ensuring\n\nthat medical needs are met according to policy.” Second, Plaintiff has presented no\n\nevidence that Ford knew Plaintiff suffered from bipolar disorder–much less that Ford\n\nknew Plaintiff’s self-destructive and defiant behavior stemmed from bipolar disorder.\n\n Moreover, Ford wrote this memorandum at Sikes’s direction, acting on the express\n\ninstructions of a medical doctor who was trained in diagnosis of mental illness, had\n\n\n\n\n                                          46\n                                          46\n\fdiagnosed Plaintiff with polysubstance abuse and not bipolar disorder, and had\n\nrecommended behavior modification treatment as opposed to medication.\n\n      Second, Plaintiff faults Ford for the overnight “delay in treatment” once it had\n\nbeen determined that Plaintiff needed to go to Central for further evaluation. It is\n\nundisputed that on the night of January 29, Ford knew it had been determined that\n\nPlaintiff should be sent to Central. It is also undisputed that officials secured Plaintiff\n\nin four-point restraints overnight and sent her to Central the next morning. Plaintiff\n\nalleges that it was Ford’s decision to delay the transfer and that Ford decided to apply\n\nfour-point restraints without a prior order from a medical doctor.26\n\n      Again, however, Plaintiff has presented no evidence that Ford knew that Plaintiff\n\nhad bipolar disorder or that such overnight delay amounted to grossly inadequate care.\n\nDr. Paddock’s affidavit purports to support a finding that Ford “had to know” the care\n\nPlaintiff received was grossly inadequate:\n\n      Defendant Ford was in a position and exercising responsibility in which\n      she would have had to know that further and additional mental\n      health/psychological evaluation and assessment of Ms. Plaintiff were\n      required by her and consistent with the competencies of other members\n      of the treatment team (e.g., licensed psychologists and psychiatric\n      physicians), and that the acts undertaken were grossly deficient.\n\n\n\n\n       26\n         According to Plaintiff, the medical doctor’s order approving the four-point restraints\nused on this occasion was signed almost two months later on March 24, 1991.\n\n                                               47\n                                               47\n\fAs discussed regarding Sikes, this expert affidavit does not suffice to support a finding\n\nthat Ford knew her care was grossly inadequate but persisted in that treatment. At best,\n\nit might support a finding that Ford’s care was grossly inadequate or a finding that\n\nFord should have known or perceived–or “had to know”–her care was grossly\n\ninadequate. However, as explained above, “[t]here is no liability for ‘an official’s\n\nfailure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not . . . .’”\n\nCottrell v.

Defendant Gavin\n\n        Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant Gavin, the GWCI warden, was not\n\nemployed as a mental health professional. Plaintiff claims only that Gavin was\n\ndeliberately indifferent in supervising others who were deliberately indifferent to her\n\nserious medical needs. By its own terms, Plaintiff’s claim against Gavin cannot\n\nsucceed without evidence of an underlying constitutional violation by one of the\n\nmental health professionals. As explained above, the record contains no such evidence.\n\nThus, Gavin is necessarily entitled to summary judgment on this claim.27\n\n                                    VI.

Proof Required that Force Used Maliciously and Sadistically to Cause\n      Harm\n\n      The Eighth Amendment’s proscription of cruel and unusual punishments also\n\ngoverns prison officials’ use of force against convicted inmates.

To establish an Eighth Amendment claim for excessive force,\n\nhowever, Plaintiff must meet an intent requirement more stringent than Farmer’s\n\ndeliberate-indifference standard: she must prove that “force was applied . . .\n\nmaliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.” Whitley, 475 U.S.\n\nat 320-21 (quoting Johnson v.

Reviewing the force used to quell a prison riot in Whitley, the Court explained\n\nthat “whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering\n\nultimately turns on ‘whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or\n\nrestore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing\n\nharm.’” Id. at 320-21 (quoting Johnson, 481 F.2d at 1033).\n\n      Subsequently, in Hudson v. McMillian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), the Supreme Court\n\nextended Whitley’s holding outside the prison-riot context and applied the same\n\nheightened intent requirement to force used as a prophylactic, preventive measure. See\n\nWhitley, 475 U.S. at 322 (acknowledging the distinction). The Hudson Court held that\n\n“whenever prison officials stand accused of using excessive physical force in violation\n\nof the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is that set out\n\nin Whitley: whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore\n\ndiscipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” Id. at 6-7. The Court\n\nreasoned that even absent the exigency present during a riot-like disturbance,\n\n“‘“[p]rison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the\n\nadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to\n\npreserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”’” Hudson,\n\n503 U.S. at 7 (quoting Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321-22 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n\n                                           <span class=\"page\">50</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n                                           50\n\f520, 547 (1979))). Thus, Hudson dictates that Whitley’s standard–force applied\n\nmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm–applies to all claims that prison officials\n\nused excessive force against convicted prisoners.\n\n      In addition to defining the mental state required, Hudson and Whitley outline\n\nfive distinct factors relevant to ascertaining whether force was used “maliciously and\n\nsadistically for the very purpose of causing harm”: (1) “the extent of injury”; (2) “the\n\nneed for application of force”; (3) “the relationship between that need and the amount\n\nof force used”; (4) “any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response”; and\n\n(5) “the extent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably perceived\n\nby the responsible officials on the basis of facts known to them.” Whitley, 475 U.S.\n\nat 321; see also Hudson, 503 U.S. at 7. Whitley also narrows the precise inquiry\n\napplicable when deciding whether officials are entitled to judgment as a matter of law:\n\n      courts must determine whether the evidence goes beyond a mere dispute\n      over the reasonableness of a particular use of force or the existence of\n      arguably superior alternatives. Unless it appears that the evidence,\n      viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, will support a reliable\n      inference of wantonness in the infliction of pain under the standard we\n      have described, the case should not go to the jury.\n\nWhitley, 475 U.S. at 322 (emphasis added).\n\nB.

Thus, we review prior decisions of this Court applying Whitley to\n\nuses of restraints and isolation.\n\n      Affirming summary judgment in Williams v. Burton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567916\"><a href=\"/opinion/567916/michael-d-williams-v-larry-w-burton-james-h-deloach-kenneth-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.\n\n1991), this Court held that the officials’ using four-point restraints and a gag was not\n\nexcessive force. Officials placed Williams in four-point restraints, with gauze and tape\n\nover his mouth, for twenty-eight and one-half hours. Id. at 1574. There were only\n\nbrief intervals for eating, physical exercise, and toilet use. Id. Noting that Williams\n\nhad threatened to kill officials, spat on them, and thrown bodily fluids at them, this\n\nCourt explained that the four-point restraints and gag were not excessive force but were\n\nused to prevent Williams from harming himself or officials:\n\n      [t]he four-point restraints were used to reduce or eliminate Williams’\n      ability to inflict physical harm against either himself or the correction\n      officers. The restraints were not used for the purpose of inflicting pain.\n      The gauze padding and tape were used to prevent Williams from\n      encouraging further unrest among the other inmates in the segregation\n      unit, as well as to protect the officers from his continuing spital assault.\n\nId. at 1575. Also important to the Williams decision were the observations (1) that\n\nalthough the inmate “experienced some discomfort because of his restraint, no actual\n\ninjury was inflicted” id.; and (2) that “constant monitoring and examinations by\n\nmedical personnel” were adequate to safeguard the inmate’s well-being. Id.\n\n\n\n                                          52\n                                          52\n\f      Williams stresses that courts should afford great deference to prison officials\n\nregarding the use of restraints as a prophylactic or preventive measure, stating:\n\n      How long restraint may be continued calls for the exercise of good\n      judgment on the part of prison officials. Once it is established that the\n      force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain discipline and not\n      maliciously or sadistically for the purpose of causing harm, the courts\n      give great deference to the actions of prison officials in applying\n      prophylactic or preventive measures intended to reduce the incidence of\n      riots and other breaches of prison discipline.\n\nId. at 1576 (internal citations omitted).       This Court also found the officials’\n\n“continuous observation and management of Williams during his restraint” showed\n\ntheir good faith, and we concurred with the district court’s holding that “Williams’\n\nhistory of persistent disobedience and the potential for a disturbance in the segregation\n\nunit justified the continued use of the restraints and gag until the officers were\n\nreasonably assured that the situation had abated.” Id.\n\n      Similarly, in Sims v. Mashburn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670830\"><a href=\"/opinion/670830/hardie-vertrain-sims-jr-v-mashburn-officer-coi-john-b-sanderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1994), this Court upheld\n\nthe officials’ use of a stripped cell for twenty-nine hours and reversed the district\n\ncourt’s grant of judgment for the inmate. The inmate in Sims hung various items over\n\nthe window to his cell, preventing prison officials from observing his behavior; he\n\nplaced a towel in the toilet, which officers took as an implicit threat to flood the\n\nsegregation unit; and he threatened that if officials entered his cell, “I’ll buck; you’ll\n\nhave to kill me.” Id. at 981. On that basis, officials stripped his cell and removed all\n\n\n                                           53\n                                           53\n\fclothing except his undershorts, and they disconnected the water to his toilet. Id. at\n\n981-82.\n\n      In determining whether the officials had used good faith or acted “maliciously\n\nand sadistically to cause harm,” this Court observed that the officers had followed the\n\nprison’s operating procedures for stripping cells, which required, among other things,\n\ndocumenting the incident and checking on the inmate’s status every fifteen minutes.\n\nId. at 985-86. Again, we emphasized that compliance with an established prison policy\n\nevidences an official’s good faith, particularly when, as in Sims, “[t]he policy itself\n\nreflects a well-developed and planned procedure.” Id. at 986. In the field of prison\n\ndiscipline, “prison officials, not judges, are experts.” Id.\n\nC.    Application To This Case\n\n      Plaintiff focuses on the instances in which officials used the “L” shape restraint\n\nin addition to the straightjacket. The record reflects that officials used the “L” shape\n\nrestraint at least five different times for periods of twenty-seven hours on September\n\n18 to 19, one hour and twenty-five minutes on September 22, five hours on October\n\n12 to 13, sixteen hours on October 23 to 24, and sixty-six hours and forty minutes on\n\nOctober 25 to 28.\n\n      As explained above, Plaintiff’s excessive-force claim depends on whether these\n\nperiods of restraint were instituted “maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose\n\n\n                                           54\n                                           54\n\fof causing harm.” Precedent dictates that this determination be guided by the five\n\nHudson/Whitley factors outlined above, by deference to prison officials’ punitive\n\njudgments, and by this Court’s previous holdings that compliance with prison policies\n\nevidences officials’ good faith. For several reasons, such considerations convince us\n\nthat the record here does not create a factual issue regarding malicious or sadistic\n\nintent.\n\n          First, the urgent need for force was readily apparent each time the “L” shape\n\nrestraint was applied; the undisputed facts show Plaintiff posed a serious threat to\n\nherself and to others. Plaintiff not only told officials that she was considering suicide\n\nbut also actually took steps toward harming herself on more than one occasion. When\n\nthe “L” shape restraint was applied initially in September 1991, officials found her\n\nstanding on the bed with a sheet around her neck. As noted above, on other occasions,\n\nshe thrashed about her cell, climbed up on the sink, ripped her sheets to shreds, beat\n\non and dismantled the overhead light, and attempted to obtain sharp objects. Plaintiff\n\nalso bit and scratched prison officials, and she repeatedly threatened to “hurt\n\nsomeone.” Some of Plaintiff’s actions posed a security risk as well. She regularly\n\nthreatened to flood the toilet, and she often started fires in her cell, burning such items\n\nas her food tray, her Bible, and her clothing. One clothing fire mandated evacuation\n\nof her entire cellblock.\n\n\n                                            55\n                                            55\n\f      Moreover, lesser restraints were ineffective in curbing Plaintiff’s dangerous\n\nbehavior. Plaintiff freed herself from straightjackets on multiple occasions. In\n\naddition, on one occasion when officials used only a straightjacket, Plaintiff began\n\nbanging her head and kicking.\n\n      Although resulting in physical discomfort and emotional pain, the restraints\n\nundisputedly caused Plaintiff no physical injury. More importantly, the officers\n\ncarefully monitored Plaintiff’s physical condition while she was restrained. They\n\nchecked Plaintiff’s circulation each time they applied the “L” shape method of\n\nrestraint, and security officers checked Plaintiff every fifteen minutes while she was\n\nrestrained. There were also regular checks by medical staff, with a nurse evaluating\n\nPlaintiff’s condition every few hours and a doctor reassessing the need for restraints\n\nevery twenty-four hours.\n\n      Additionally, the severity of the restraint was tempered somewhat by attention\n\nto Plaintiff’s basic physical needs. During periods of restraint, Plaintiff was given\n\n“toileting” on request,28 offered meals at regular intervals, and sometimes given a\n\nmattress rather than being made to lie on the floor.\n\n\n\n\n       28\n           Plaintiff asserts that there was one instance in which she urinated on herself while in\nrestraints and the situation was not discovered for some hours.\n\n                                                56\n                                                56\n\f      Also evidencing the officials’ good faith is their compliance with prison\n\nprocedures for using restraints. GWCI policies provide for extensive documentation\n\nand monitoring when restraints are used, and Defendants met and exceeded those\n\nrequirements.      For example, in addition to completing the required written\n\ndocumentation, Defendants videotaped some of the instances in which they used the\n\n“L” shape restraint.29\n\n      In addition, on at least two different occasions, Sikes declined to approve\n\nrestraints when other officials requested them. Each time, Sikes instructed the\n\nrequesting officials that restraints should not be applied when Plaintiff did not pose a\n\nthreat to her own safety. Such decisionmaking by Sikes hardly betrays a malicious or\n\nsadistic motive.\n\n       Plaintiff provides no viable reason to depart from the conclusion dictated by\n\nthese considerations. Her main contention is that four-point restraints would have been\n\nequally effective and less dehumanizing than the “L” shape. In addition, she points to\n\na deputy prison commissioner’s testimony that he was shocked to hear that prisoners\n\nwere being “hog-tied.” However, such evidence raises “a mere dispute over the\n\nreasonableness of a particular use of force or the existence of arguably superior\n\n\n\n       29\n         Plaintiff entered in the record before the magistrate judge a videotape of several “L”\nshape incidents, and that tape is part of the record on appeal as well.\n\n                                               57\n                                               57\n\falternatives,” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 322, and would not suffice to support a jury finding\n\nthat the officials restrained Plaintiff in this manner “maliciously and sadistically for the\n\nvery purpose of causing harm.” Id. at 320-21.\n\n       There is also no showing that the “L” shape method of restraint used here\n\nviolated prison policies.30 Both GDOC and GWCI policies clearly allowed restraints\n\nto be used to curb dangerous behavior, and neither policy forbade this particular\n\nmethod of restraint. GDOC operating procedures merely authorized restraints “to\n\nprevent the inmate from hurting himself or others” and defined “hard restraints” versus\n\n“soft restraints.” GDOC Standard Operating Procedure No. VC01-0014 (Revised Oct.\n\n1, 1989).31 Similarly, GWCI policy authorized restraints as “a temporary means of\n\ncontrolling an inmate’s destructive behavior toward herself and others.” GWCI Policy\n\nStatement No. 801.1 (activated Nov. 1, 1989; revised June 13, 1991). GWCI policy\n\nalso examined the costs and benefits of several different methods of restraint, noting\n\nthat “[t]he following comments should be reviewed and considered in making a\n\ndecision as to which devices to use when restraint is necessary.” Id. The “L” shape\n\n\n       30\n           It is far from clear in the case law that officials’ violating prison policy would\nnecessarily establish the requisite subjective mental intent. In this case, however, because there\nis insufficient evidence to support a finding that prison policies were violated, we need not\naddress whether a violation of prison policies is per se malicious and sadistic.\n       31\n          We refer to the policies in effect when the challenged instances of restraint occurred.\nThere is some indication in the record that since that time, the policies may have been amended\nto proscribe “hog-tying.”\n\n                                                58\n                                                58\n\fmethod used here was not expressly listed, but GWCI policy expressly provided in a\n\nseparate subsection that a physician might “also consider other options as to the\n\nmethod of restraint most likely to be appropriate.” Id.\n\n      Plaintiff argues that the absence of “hog-tying” from the lists of possible\n\nrestraint methods meant the “L” shape method used here was forbidden. In support of\n\nthat contention, she offers the testimony of a deputy prison commissioner who\n\ninterpreted the state operating procedures to ban “hog-tying.” However, the deputy\n\ncommissioner’s testimony is insufficient to create a triable issue in the face of the clear\n\nand unambiguous language of the policies themselves, which did not ban or in any way\n\nproscribe this method of restraint but instead expressly permitted doctors to consider\n\nusing other methods of restraint.\n\n                                 VII. CONCLUSION\n\n      Because we find insufficient evidence to support a jury’s finding that any of the\n\nDefendants possessed the subjective mental intent required to support Plaintiff’s\n\ndeliberate-indifference and excessive-force claims, the magistrate judge’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment for Defendants Sikes, Moore, Gavin, and Ford is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                            59\n                                            59\n\f</pre>",
