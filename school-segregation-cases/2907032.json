Forgie, Forgie & Leonard, LLP, of Santa Monica,\nCalifornia, for defendant-appellee Catalina Channel Express,\nInc.\n\f9538         LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\n                          OPINION\n\nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Catalina Channel Express (“CCE”) operates a ferry\nbetween Long Beach and Catalina Island. In response to\nrequests by a frequent passenger for an area free of animal\ndander, CCE adopted a policy of excluding animals from the\nCommodore Lounge, a separate and more expensive section\nof the ferry. Tricia Lockett is legally blind and uses a service\nanimal, a guide dog, to assist her. On September 2, 2002,\nLockett requested a ticket in the Commodore Lounge, but\nCCE refused to sell her a ticket because it would not allow her\nto take her guide dog into the area. Two weeks later CCE\nchanged its policy, but two months later Lockett filed this\nlawsuit alleging that CCE violated the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. On cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court granted\nsummary judgment for CCE. We affirm on the narrow ground\nthat CCE, when suddenly faced with a possible threat to the\nhealth and safety of its passengers, made a one-time reason-\nable judgment under 28 C.F.R. § 36.208 while it investigated\nthe competing interests.\n\n                               I\n\n   CCE operates a public ferry boat service between Long\nBeach and Catalina Island. The trip takes an hour each way.\nIn addition to the general passenger seating area, the Commo-\ndore Lounge, located on the second deck, serves as a semi-\nprivate sitting area for a small number of passengers who pay\nan additional ten dollars each way for access. The Commo-\ndore Lounge has leather seats that slightly recline and have\ntray tables and head rests. Also, Commodore Lounge passen-\ngers have the privilege of priority boarding and are served a\ncomplimentary drink.\n\f              LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS                9539\n   In 2000, CCE received a request for a dander-free zone\nfrom a frequent passenger who claimed to be allergic to ani-\nmals. CCE determined that the Commodore Lounge was the\nonly area on the ferry where passengers could be effectively\ninsulated from contact with animals and made dander-free.1 In\nearly 2001, CCE instituted a policy prohibiting all animals,\nincluding service animals, from the Commodore Lounge.\n\n   Lockett is legally blind and uses a service animal, a guide\ndog, to assist her in travel and mobility. On September 2,\n2002, she sought to purchase a ticket to travel on the ferry to\nCatalina Island in the Commodore Lounge. CCE declined to\nsell Lockett a ticket for the Commodore Lounge because it\ndid not permit any animals, even guide dogs, in the Commo-\ndore Lounge. CCE did sell Lockett a general passage ticket\nand Lockett traveled to Catalina Island and back to Long\nBeach in the main seating area.\n\n   CCE changed its animal policy two weeks later to allow\nservice animals in the Commodore Lounge. CCE estimates\nthat now service animals are brought into the Commodore\nLounge once or twice a year.\n\n                                  II\n\n   On November 18, 2002, Locket filed a complaint in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of Califor-\nnia seeking damages and injunctive relief under the ADA,\ncertain California statutes, and common law. Lockett stated\nthat the experience of being denied a ticket to the Commodore\nLounge was “embarrassing and frustrating and humiliation\n[sic].”\n  1\n   Although the district court observed that the parties disagreed on\nwhether the case concerned architectural barriers as defined under the\nADA standards, it declined to decide the case on that issue. We do not\naddress any issue concerning architectural barriers because the parties\nhave not raised any such issue on appeal.\n\f9540               LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\n   In the fall of 2004, the parties filed motions for summary\njudgment. On August 24, 2005, the district court entered an\norder denying Lockett’s motion for summary judgment and\ngranting CCE’s motion for summary judgment. The district\ncourt rejected Lockett’s contention that CCE violated 42\nU.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii) in failing to modify its policies to\npermit service animals into the Commodore Lounge.2 It held\nthat CCE had provided Lockett with “different and separate\naccommodations” as allowed by 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)\n(A)(iii).3 As a separate basis for granting CCE summary judg-\nment, the district court held that CCE’s refusal to admit\nLockett’s service animal to the Commodore Lounge was per-\nmissible under 28 C.F.R. §§ 36.208, 36.301(a), and 36.302(c)\nbased on health and safety concerns. Lockett filed a timely\nappeal.\n\n  2\n   42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii) reads:\n      (ii)    Participation in unequal benefit\n      It shall be discriminatory to afford an individual or class of indi-\n      viduals, on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such individ-\n      ual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or other\n      arrangements with the opportunity to participate in or benefit\n      from a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommo-\n      dation that is not equal to that afforded to other individuals.\n  3\n   42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(iii) reads:\n      (iii)   Separate benefit\n      It shall be discriminatory to provide an individual or class of indi-\n      viduals, on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such individ-\n      ual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or other\n      arrangements with a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage,\n      or accommodation that is different or separate from that provided\n      to other individuals, unless such action is necessary to provide\n      the individual or class of individuals with a good, service, facil-\n      ity, privilege, advantage, or accommodation, or other opportunity\n      that is as effective as that provided to others.\n\f             LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS            9541\n                               III\n\n   As noted by the district court, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is proper only\nwhere “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” We review the district court’s grant of summary judg-\nment for CCE de novo. Oregon Paralyzed Veterans of Amer-\nica v. Regal Cinemas, Inc., 339 F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir.\n2003). We “must determine, viewing the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any\ngenuine issues of material fact and whether the district court\ncorrectly applied the relevant substantive law.” Id. at 1131.\n\n                               IV\n\n   [1] It is undisputed that Lockett is a member of a protected\nclass of disabled persons under 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). In light\nof the purposes of the ADA, CCE’s refusal to sell Lockett a\nticket to the Commodore Lounge cannot be justified as a sep-\narate arrangement under 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(iii). This\nsubsection allows for a separate arrangement or facility when\n“necessary to provide the individual . . . with a good, service,\nfacility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation, . . . as effec-\ntive as that provided to others.” For this subsection to come\ninto play, there must be (1) a separate arrangement or facility,\nwhich (2) was necessary for the disabled person, and (3) was\n“as effective as” that for which it was a substitution. Here,\nCCE did not offer Lockett a separate arrangement or facility,\nbut relegated her to the general passenger area. Thus, this sub-\nsection is not applicable. Moreover, even if it were applicable,\nthe general passenger area was not equivalent to — not “as\neffective as” — the Commodore Lounge. The record shows\nthat some travelers were willing to pay a premium for a seat\nthat reclines, early boarding, and being served a cookie and a\ndrink. In other words, the Commodore Lounge is the equiva-\n\f9542             LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\nlent of a first class section on an airplane. Construing the sub-\nsection to allow the relegation of an individual with a\ndisability to tourist class, or to the back of the airplane, on the\nrationalization that the individual was allowed to travel on the\nsame plane would distort the letter and intent of the subsec-\ntion. Furthermore, even if it could be argued that there was a\nfactual question as to whether the general passenger area was\n“as effective as” the Commodore Lounge, that question would\nbe a matter for the jury, and could not be determined on sum-\nmary judgment. CCE’s relegation of Lockett to the general\npassenger area was not a permissible accommodation under\n42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(iii).\n\n                                      V\n\n   We recognize, however, that Lockett’s request for passage\nin the Commodore Lounge created a dilemma for CCE. Its\nprohibition on animals in the Commodore Lounge was\nadopted in response to a passenger’s assertion of an allergy to\nanimal dander. Accordingly, CCE’s employees had to decide\non the spot whether to potentially expose passengers in the\nCommodore Lounge to dander or to ask Lockett to ride in the\ngeneral passenger area. We read 29 C.F.R. § 36.208 as per-\nmitting CCE to ask Lockett to travel in the general passenger\narea while it investigated the matter.4\n  4\n   28 C.F.R. § 36.208 reads:\n      (a) This part does not require a public accommodation to permit\n      an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services,\n      facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that\n      public accommodation when that individual poses a direct threat\n      to the health or safety of others.\n      (b) Direct threat means a significant risk to the health or safety\n      of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies,\n      practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\n      services.\n      (c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to\n      the health or safety of others, a public accommodation must make\n\f               LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS                     9543\n   [2] This regulation provides that an individual can be\ndenied an accommodation when the individual “poses a direct\nthreat to the health or safety of others.” Subsection (b) notes\nthat direct threat means that the significant risk “cannot be\neliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or proce-\ndures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.” Sub-\nsection (c) states:\n\n     In determining whether an individual poses a direct\n     threat to the health or safety of others, a public\n     accommodation must make an individualized assess-\n     ment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on\n     current medical knowledge or on the best available\n     objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration,\n     and severity of the risk; the probability that the\n     potential injury will actually occur; and whether rea-\n     sonable modifications of policies, practices, or pro-\n     cedures will mitigate the risk.\n\n   [3] Applying the regulation to the situation presented in this\ncase, it appears that CCE was faced with a potential threat to\nthe health and safety of others, and that the threat could not\nbe eliminated by a modification of the policy. Accordingly,\nCCE had to make a reasonable judgment based on the avail-\nable medical knowledge and objective evidence.5 We hold\n\n      an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that\n      relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available\n      objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity\n      of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually\n      occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, prac-\n      tices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.\n   5\n     There is no indication that CCE knew, or should have known, whether\nany passenger in the Commodore Lounge on September 2, 2002, was\nallergic to animal dander. Moreover, there is no indication that CCE knew,\nor should have known, the severity of any passenger’s alleged allergy to\ndander. However, it is not difficult to conceive of the potential health ram-\nifications for a passenger with a severe allergy to animal dander who, hav-\n\f9544           LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\nthat CCE’s one-time request that Lockett accept passage in\nthe general passenger area was a reasonable judgment under\n28 C.F.R. § 36.208.\n\n   We hasten to note that this holding is limited to CCE’s sin-\ngle determination made on September 2, 2002, and should not\nbe read as suggesting that CCE’s change in its policy to allow\nservice animals in the Commodore Lounge was not compelled\nunder the ADA. To the contrary, it is clear that ultimately the\nentity asserting a “direct threat” as a basis for excluding an\nindividual bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the\nindividual poses a significant risk to the health and safety of\nothers. See Bragdon v. Abbot, 524 U.S. 624, 649-50 (1998).\nIndeed, CCE may well have violated the ADA had it not\nchanged its policy.6\n\ning been informed that animals are not allowed into the Commodore\nLounge, is then confronted with a service dog entering the area. We can-\nnot say that it was unreasonable for CCE to ask Lockett to ride in the gen-\neral passenger area with her service animal while it ascertained how\nsevere an allergic reaction to animal dander was medically possible or\nlikely, and informed its riders that service animals would be allowed in the\nCommodore Lounge.\n   6\n     28 C.F.R. 36.302 reads, in relevant part:\n    (a) General. A public accommodation shall make reasonable\n    modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when the\n    modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, facilities,\n    privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with\n    disabilities, unless the public accommodation can demonstrate\n    that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the\n    nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n    accommodations.\n    ...\n    (c) Service animals—\n    (1) General. Generally, a public accommodation shall modify\n    policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service\n    animal by an individual with a disability.\n\f               LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS                      9545\n   However, in this case we are asked to determine whether\nCCE’s failure to immediately accede to Lockett’s request sup-\nports a cause of action. Neither party has cited any case\ndirectly on point and we have not found such a case.7 Most\nof the cases we have reviewed addressed a provider’s ultimate\ndecision concerning the accommodation it is willing to make.\nFor example, in Anderson v. Little League Baseball, Inc., 794\nF. Supp. 342, 345-46 (D. Ariz. 1992), the district court issued\na temporary restraining order because the defendant adopted\na rule prohibiting a person in a wheelchair from being in a\ncoach’s box on the field, and had not conducted an individual-\nized assessment. In Bombrys v. City of Toledo, 849 F. Supp.\n1210, 1221 (N.D. Ohio 1993), the district court granted relief\nagainst the city’s blanket exclusion of insulin-dependent dia-\nbetics from the police force. Also, in Doe v. District of\nColumbia, 796 F. Supp. 559, 573 (D.D.C. 1992), the district\ncourt granted relief because the city had withdrawn its offer\nof employment based on the plaintiff being HIV-positive.\nNone of these cases concerned a lawsuit brought after the\ndefendant had made the requested accommodation under the\nADA, but challenging the defendant’s failure to make an\naccommodation as soon as it was first requested.8\n\n   [4] Faced with an issue of first impression, we conclude\nthat CCE’s single decision on September 2, 2002, to ask\nLockett to ride in the general passenger area was a reasonable\njudgment under 28 C.F.R. § 36.208. On that day, the ticket\n  7\n     The district court cited only an unpublished district court case, Pool v.\nRiverside Health Servs., Inc., No-941430-PFK, 1995 WL 519129 (D. Kan.\nAug. 25, 1995). In that case, the district court determined that Ms. Pool,\nwho was confined to a wheelchair, could not state a cause of action under\nthe ADA based on the hospital’s refusal to allow her to take her “assis-\ntance dog” into the hospital’s emergency services department where Ms.\nPool’s fiancé was being treated. Although this case shows that not all\nrefusals to accommodate are actionable, it is too factually distinct from the\ncase before this court to provide much guidance.\n   8\n     At the time that Lockett filed her complaint, CCE had already changed\nits policy to allow service animals in the Commodore Lounge.\n\f9546         LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\nseller was required to make a “reasonable judgment” based on\n“current medical knowledge” and the “best available objec-\ntive evidence.” The ticket seller knew only that CCE had\nadopted a policy based on a passenger’s alleged allergy, and\nthere is no suggestion that the person had any training to eval-\nuate the possible effect on an allergic passenger of the pres-\nence of a service animal in the Commodore Lounge. With the\nferry scheduled to depart, selling Lockett a ticket for the gen-\neral passenger area was a reasonable judgment. It allowed\nCCE to provide Lockett with transportation to Catalina Island,\nas she requested, albeit without the benefits and the cost of the\nCommodore Lounge.\n\n   [5] We further hold that in this instance, the determination\nthat selling Lockett a ticket to the general passenger area was\na reasonable judgment under 28 C.F.R. § 36.208 was properly\nmade on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.\nAll the evidence as to what the CCE employees knew on Sep-\ntember 2, 2002 was before the district court. Lockett does not\nallege that she was precluded from presenting relevant evi-\ndence. Instead, on appeal, she argues that the district court\nshould have granted her summary judgment on the liability\nissue. We agree with the district court that the evidence\nrequired a finding that CCE’s decision on September 2, 2002\nto relegate Lockett to the general passenger area was a reason-\nable judgment under 28 C.F.R. § 36.208. Accordingly, on this\nground only, the district court’s order is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nHALL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   Because I find that Catalina Channel Express failed to\nmake the individualized assessment required under the Amer-\nicans with Disabilities Act, and failed to consider whether rea-\nsonable modifications could be made in this individual case,\nI respectfully dissent.\n\f             LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS             9547\n   Under the ADA, a place of public accommodation may\nexclude a disabled individual from a service or opportunity,\nif that individual “poses a direct threat to the health or safety\nof others.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(3). A “direct threat” is\ndefined as “a significant risk to the health or safety of others\nthat cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, prac-\ntices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\nservices.” Id. “When determining whether an individual poses\na ‘direct threat,’ a place of public accommodation must not\nbase its calculus on stereotypes or generalizations about the\neffects of a disability but rather must make ‘an individualized\nassessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on cur-\nrent medical knowledge or on the best available objective evi-\ndence.’ ” Montalvo v. Radcliffe, 167 F.3d 873, 877 (4th Cir.\n1999) (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 36.208(c)). This assessment must\nconsider the nature, duration, and severity of the risk. 28\nC.F.R. § 36.208.\n\n   Under this rule, a good faith belief that a risk exists is not\nsufficient. Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 649 (1998). The\nperson making the relevant decision not to provide the service\nmust base his decision on the objective information available\nto him. See id. In Bragdon, a dentist had declined to see an\nHIV-positive patient on the basis that she would have posed\na risk to the health of others. The Supreme Court used the\nopportunity to elaborate on the “direct threat” standard:\n\n    The existence, or nonexistence, of a significant risk\n    must be determined from the standpoint of the per-\n    son who refuses the treatment or accommodation,\n    and the risk assessment must be based on medical or\n    other objective evidence. As a health care profes-\n    sional, petitioner had the duty to assess the risk of\n    infection based on the objective, scientific informa-\n    tion available to him and others in his profession.\n    His belief that a significant risk existed, even if\n    maintained in good faith, would not relieve him from\n    liability. To use the words of the question presented,\n\f9548         LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\n    petitioner receives no special deference simply\n    because he is a health care professional.\n\nId. However, the Court has previously held that medical judg-\nments based on the duration, severity and nature of the risk\nare entitled to deference. See School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v.\nArline, 480 U.S. 273, 288 (1987).\n\n   The risk to others must also be “significant.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12182(b)(3). The ADA’s statutory language regarding the\nthreat to others was adopted from Arline, a case dealing with\ninfectious disease. See Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649 (discussing\nthe influence of Arline). As the Court acknowledged, “Arline\nand the ADA do not ask whether a risk exists, but whether it\nis significant.” Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. In Doe v. District\nof Columbia, 796 F. Supp. 559 (D.D.C. 1992), for example,\nthe district court held that hiring an HIV-positive firefighter\nwould pose no “measurable risk” of infection to other fire-\nfighters or the public. Id. at 569.\n\n   The ADA’s required analysis does not end, however, with\na finding of significant risk. If it finds such a threat, the ser-\nvice provider must then ascertain “whether reasonable modifi-\ncations of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the\nrisk, to the point of eliminating it as a significant risk.” Mon-\ntalvo, 167 F.3d at 877 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 36.208(c) and 42\nU.S.C.§ 12182(b)(3))(internal punctuation omitted). As the\nFourth Circuit explained in Montalvo, one of the few appel-\nlate decisions dealing with these provisions, “a failure to\nmake a reasonable modification is itself an act of discrimina-\ntion unless the place of public accommodation can demon-\nstrate that implementing the modification would\nfundamentally alter the nature of the program.” Id.\n\n  The interaction between Lockett and Catalina Channel\nExpress falls far short of this statutory procedure. First, CCE\nmade no “individualized assessment” as to the health effects\nof bringing Lockett’s dog aboard. Though it had limited\n\f             LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS             9549\nobjective evidence, it could have investigated whether the\nfemale passenger who had complained about dander was in\nfact on the ship, or whether there were other allergic passen-\ngers in the lounge. Though CCE did not appear to act with\nmalice, pure intentions and good faith are not sufficient under\nthe ADA.\n\n   Second, the risk to others was not found, objectively, to be\nsignificant. The frequent passenger who allegedly requested a\ndander-free environment (a passenger who was never\ndeposed, let alone named, by CCE) did not suggest this policy\nwas necessary as a matter of serious public health concern,\nalong the lines of an infectious disease. It bears repeating that\nCCE never determined whether any allergic passenger would\neven be in the lounge area.\n\n   The opinion in this case treats the decision about Lockett\nas an individualized assessment, but it appears that the ticket\nagent was simply applying CCE’s policy as a matter of reflex.\nUnder the ADA, the standard for judging the application of a\npolicy is the same as the standard for one-time action: “Safety\nrequirements must be based on actual risks and not on mere\nspeculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals\nwith disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. 36.301. In Leiken v. Squaw Val-\nley Ski Corp., 1994 WL 494298, 3 A.D. Cases 945 (E.D. Cal.\n1994), the district court granted a preliminary injunction\nagainst a ski resort’s policy of barring wheelchairs from the\ncable car used to access a high-altitude recreation area. The\nresort had justified the policy on the grounds that wheelchairs\nwould hinder any emergency evacuation of the cable car. The\ndistrict court held that the ski resort “cannot justify its policy\nas a series of individual safety-based exclusions because it has\nnot performed individualized risk assessments.” Id.; see also\nBombrys v. City of Toledo, 849 F. Supp. 1210, 1216 (N.D.\nOhio 1993); Anderson v. Little League Baseball, Inc., 794 F.\nSupp. 342, 345 (D. Ariz. 1992). As in these cases, CCE made\na blanket policy and applied it to Lockett without considering\nthe individual facts of her case.\n\f9550         LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\n   Finally, CCE’s employees did not investigate whether a\n“reasonable modification” would neutralize any health threat.\nThough the lounge was allegedly the only area where allergic\npassengers could be segregated from animals, CCE did not\ninvestigate whether there were in fact other allergic passen-\ngers aboard, whether any passengers could be persuaded to sit\nelsewhere, or whether Lockett could be seated in any particu-\nlar part of the lounge where the dog’s dander would pose the\nleast risk.\n\n   Though it was no doubt wise and well-intentioned for CCE\nto eliminate this policy following the Lockett incident, this\nchange of course does not remedy whatever damage Lockett\nalleges from the initial violation. Any sentiment that her claim\nis too small to be worthwhile, or that CCE should not be pun-\nished when it has acted admirably otherwise, is an issue best\nleft to the jury when determining damages. Accordingly, I\ndissent.\n\f",

Forgie, Forgie & Leonard, LLP, of Santa Monica,\nCalifornia, for defendant-appellee Catalina Channel Express,\nInc.\n\f9538         LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\n                          OPINION\n\nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Catalina Channel Express (“CCE”) operates a ferry\nbetween Long Beach and Catalina Island. In response to\nrequests by a frequent passenger for an area free of animal\ndander, CCE adopted a policy of excluding animals from the\nCommodore Lounge, a separate and more expensive section\nof the ferry. Tricia Lockett is legally blind and uses a service\nanimal, a guide dog, to assist her. On September 2, 2002,\nLockett requested a ticket in the Commodore Lounge, but\nCCE refused to sell her a ticket because it would not allow her\nto take her guide dog into the area. Two weeks later CCE\nchanged its policy, but two months later Lockett filed this\nlawsuit alleging that CCE violated the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. On cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court granted\nsummary judgment for CCE. We affirm on the narrow ground\nthat CCE, when suddenly faced with a possible threat to the\nhealth and safety of its passengers, made a one-time reason-\nable judgment under 28 C.F.R. § 36.208 while it investigated\nthe competing interests.\n\n                               I\n\n   CCE operates a public ferry boat service between Long\nBeach and Catalina Island. The trip takes an hour each way.\nIn addition to the general passenger seating area, the Commo-\ndore Lounge, located on the second deck, serves as a semi-\nprivate sitting area for a small number of passengers who pay\nan additional ten dollars each way for access. The Commo-\ndore Lounge has leather seats that slightly recline and have\ntray tables and head rests. Also, Commodore Lounge passen-\ngers have the privilege of priority boarding and are served a\ncomplimentary drink.\n\f              LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS                9539\n   In 2000, CCE received a request for a dander-free zone\nfrom a frequent passenger who claimed to be allergic to ani-\nmals. CCE determined that the Commodore Lounge was the\nonly area on the ferry where passengers could be effectively\ninsulated from contact with animals and made dander-free.1 In\nearly 2001, CCE instituted a policy prohibiting all animals,\nincluding service animals, from the Commodore Lounge.\n\n   Lockett is legally blind and uses a service animal, a guide\ndog, to assist her in travel and mobility. On September 2,\n2002, she sought to purchase a ticket to travel on the ferry to\nCatalina Island in the Commodore Lounge. CCE declined to\nsell Lockett a ticket for the Commodore Lounge because it\ndid not permit any animals, even guide dogs, in the Commo-\ndore Lounge. CCE did sell Lockett a general passage ticket\nand Lockett traveled to Catalina Island and back to Long\nBeach in the main seating area.\n\n   CCE changed its animal policy two weeks later to allow\nservice animals in the Commodore Lounge. CCE estimates\nthat now service animals are brought into the Commodore\nLounge once or twice a year.\n\n                                  II\n\n   On November 18, 2002, Locket filed a complaint in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of Califor-\nnia seeking damages and injunctive relief under the ADA,\ncertain California statutes, and common law. Lockett stated\nthat the experience of being denied a ticket to the Commodore\nLounge was “embarrassing and frustrating and humiliation\n[sic].”\n  1\n   Although the district court observed that the parties disagreed on\nwhether the case concerned architectural barriers as defined under the\nADA standards, it declined to decide the case on that issue. We do not\naddress any issue concerning architectural barriers because the parties\nhave not raised any such issue on appeal.\n\f9540               LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\n   In the fall of 2004, the parties filed motions for summary\njudgment. On August 24, 2005, the district court entered an\norder denying Lockett’s motion for summary judgment and\ngranting CCE’s motion for summary judgment. The district\ncourt rejected Lockett’s contention that CCE violated 42\nU.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii) in failing to modify its policies to\npermit service animals into the Commodore Lounge.2 It held\nthat CCE had provided Lockett with “different and separate\naccommodations” as allowed by 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)\n(A)(iii).3 As a separate basis for granting CCE summary judg-\nment, the district court held that CCE’s refusal to admit\nLockett’s service animal to the Commodore Lounge was per-\nmissible under 28 C.F.R. §§ 36.208, 36.301(a), and 36.302(c)\nbased on health and safety concerns. Lockett filed a timely\nappeal.\n\n  2\n   42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii) reads:\n      (ii)    Participation in unequal benefit\n      It shall be discriminatory to afford an individual or class of indi-\n      viduals, on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such individ-\n      ual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or other\n      arrangements with the opportunity to participate in or benefit\n      from a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommo-\n      dation that is not equal to that afforded to other individuals.\n  3\n   42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(iii) reads:\n      (iii)   Separate benefit\n      It shall be discriminatory to provide an individual or class of indi-\n      viduals, on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such individ-\n      ual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or other\n      arrangements with a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage,\n      or accommodation that is different or separate from that provided\n      to other individuals, unless such action is necessary to provide\n      the individual or class of individuals with a good, service, facil-\n      ity, privilege, advantage, or accommodation, or other opportunity\n      that is as effective as that provided to others.\n\f             LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS            9541\n                               III\n\n   As noted by the district court, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is proper only\nwhere “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” We review the district court’s grant of summary judg-\nment for CCE de novo. Oregon Paralyzed Veterans of Amer-\nica v. Regal Cinemas, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783144\"><a href=\"/opinion/783144/oregon-paralyzed-veterans-of-america-an-oregon-non-profit-corporation-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1130 (9th Cir.\n2003). We “must determine, viewing the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any\ngenuine issues of material fact and whether the district court\ncorrectly applied the relevant substantive law.” Id. at 1131.\n\n                               IV\n\n   [1] It is undisputed that Lockett is a member of a protected\nclass of disabled persons under 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). In light\nof the purposes of the ADA, CCE’s refusal to sell Lockett a\nticket to the Commodore Lounge cannot be justified as a sep-\narate arrangement under 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(iii). This\nsubsection allows for a separate arrangement or facility when\n“necessary to provide the individual . . . with a good, service,\nfacility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation, . . . as effec-\ntive as that provided to others.” For this subsection to come\ninto play, there must be (1) a separate arrangement or facility,\nwhich (2) was necessary for the disabled person, and (3) was\n“as effective as” that for which it was a substitution. Here,\nCCE did not offer Lockett a separate arrangement or facility,\nbut relegated her to the general passenger area. Thus, this sub-\nsection is not applicable. Moreover, even if it were applicable,\nthe general passenger area was not equivalent to — not “as\neffective as” — the Commodore Lounge. The record shows\nthat some travelers were willing to pay a premium for a seat\nthat reclines, early boarding, and being served a cookie and a\ndrink. In other words, the Commodore Lounge is the equiva-\n\f9542             LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\nlent of a first class section on an airplane. Construing the sub-\nsection to allow the relegation of an individual with a\ndisability to tourist class, or to the back of the airplane, on the\nrationalization that the individual was allowed to travel on the\nsame plane would distort the letter and intent of the subsec-\ntion. Furthermore, even if it could be argued that there was a\nfactual question as to whether the general passenger area was\n“as effective as” the Commodore Lounge, that question would\nbe a matter for the jury, and could not be determined on sum-\nmary judgment. CCE’s relegation of Lockett to the general\npassenger area was not a permissible accommodation under\n42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(iii).\n\n                                      V\n\n   We recognize, however, that Lockett’s request for passage\nin the Commodore Lounge created a dilemma for CCE. Its\nprohibition on animals in the Commodore Lounge was\nadopted in response to a passenger’s assertion of an allergy to\nanimal dander. Accordingly, CCE’s employees had to decide\non the spot whether to potentially expose passengers in the\nCommodore Lounge to dander or to ask Lockett to ride in the\ngeneral passenger area. We read 29 C.F.R. § 36.208 as per-\nmitting CCE to ask Lockett to travel in the general passenger\narea while it investigated the matter.4\n  4\n   28 C.F.R. § 36.208 reads:\n      (a) This part does not require a public accommodation to permit\n      an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services,\n      facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that\n      public accommodation when that individual poses a direct threat\n      to the health or safety of others.\n      (b) Direct threat means a significant risk to the health or safety\n      of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies,\n      practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\n      services.\n      (c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to\n      the health or safety of others, a public accommodation must make\n\f               LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS                     9543\n   [2] This regulation provides that an individual can be\ndenied an accommodation when the individual “poses a direct\nthreat to the health or safety of others.” Subsection (b) notes\nthat direct threat means that the significant risk “cannot be\neliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or proce-\ndures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.” Sub-\nsection (c) states:\n\n     In determining whether an individual poses a direct\n     threat to the health or safety of others, a public\n     accommodation must make an individualized assess-\n     ment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on\n     current medical knowledge or on the best available\n     objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration,\n     and severity of the risk; the probability that the\n     potential injury will actually occur; and whether rea-\n     sonable modifications of policies, practices, or pro-\n     cedures will mitigate the risk.\n\n   [3] Applying the regulation to the situation presented in this\ncase, it appears that CCE was faced with a potential threat to\nthe health and safety of others, and that the threat could not\nbe eliminated by a modification of the policy. Accordingly,\nCCE had to make a reasonable judgment based on the avail-\nable medical knowledge and objective evidence.5 We hold\n\n      an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that\n      relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available\n      objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity\n      of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually\n      occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, prac-\n      tices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.\n   5\n     There is no indication that CCE knew, or should have known, whether\nany passenger in the Commodore Lounge on September 2, 2002, was\nallergic to animal dander. Moreover, there is no indication that CCE knew,\nor should have known, the severity of any passenger’s alleged allergy to\ndander. However, it is not difficult to conceive of the potential health ram-\nifications for a passenger with a severe allergy to animal dander who, hav-\n\f9544           LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\nthat CCE’s one-time request that Lockett accept passage in\nthe general passenger area was a reasonable judgment under\n28 C.F.R. § 36.208.\n\n   We hasten to note that this holding is limited to CCE’s sin-\ngle determination made on September 2, 2002, and should not\nbe read as suggesting that CCE’s change in its policy to allow\nservice animals in the Commodore Lounge was not compelled\nunder the ADA. To the contrary, it is clear that ultimately the\nentity asserting a “direct threat” as a basis for excluding an\nindividual bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the\nindividual poses a significant risk to the health and safety of\nothers. See Bragdon v. Abbot, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118241\"><a href=\"/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 649-50 (1998).\nIndeed, CCE may well have violated the ADA had it not\nchanged its policy.6\n\ning been informed that animals are not allowed into the Commodore\nLounge, is then confronted with a service dog entering the area. We can-\nnot say that it was unreasonable for CCE to ask Lockett to ride in the gen-\neral passenger area with her service animal while it ascertained how\nsevere an allergic reaction to animal dander was medically possible or\nlikely, and informed its riders that service animals would be allowed in the\nCommodore Lounge.\n   6\n     28 C.F.R. 36.302 reads, in relevant part:\n    (a) General. A public accommodation shall make reasonable\n    modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when the\n    modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, facilities,\n    privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with\n    disabilities, unless the public accommodation can demonstrate\n    that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the\n    nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n    accommodations.\n    ...\n    (c) Service animals—\n    (1) General. Generally, a public accommodation shall modify\n    policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service\n    animal by an individual with a disability.\n\f               LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS                      9545\n   However, in this case we are asked to determine whether\nCCE’s failure to immediately accede to Lockett’s request sup-\nports a cause of action. Neither party has cited any case\ndirectly on point and we have not found such a case.7 Most\nof the cases we have reviewed addressed a provider’s ultimate\ndecision concerning the accommodation it is willing to make.\nFor example, in Anderson v. Little League Baseball, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1477176\"><a href=\"/opinion/1477176/anderson-v-little-league-baseball-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

On that day, the ticket\n  7\n     The district court cited only an unpublished district court case, Pool v.\nRiverside Health Servs., Inc., No-941430-PFK, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">519129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Kan.\nAug. 25, 1995). In that case, the district court determined that Ms. Pool,\nwho was confined to a wheelchair, could not state a cause of action under\nthe ADA based on the hospital’s refusal to allow her to take her “assis-\ntance dog” into the hospital’s emergency services department where Ms.\nPool’s fiancé was being treated. Although this case shows that not all\nrefusals to accommodate are actionable, it is too factually distinct from the\ncase before this court to provide much guidance.\n   8\n     At the time that Lockett filed her complaint, CCE had already changed\nits policy to allow service animals in the Commodore Lounge.\n\f9546         LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\nseller was required to make a “reasonable judgment” based on\n“current medical knowledge” and the “best available objec-\ntive evidence.” The ticket seller knew only that CCE had\nadopted a policy based on a passenger’s alleged allergy, and\nthere is no suggestion that the person had any training to eval-\nuate the possible effect on an allergic passenger of the pres-\nence of a service animal in the Commodore Lounge. With the\nferry scheduled to depart, selling Lockett a ticket for the gen-\neral passenger area was a reasonable judgment. It allowed\nCCE to provide Lockett with transportation to Catalina Island,\nas she requested, albeit without the benefits and the cost of the\nCommodore Lounge.\n\n   [5] We further hold that in this instance, the determination\nthat selling Lockett a ticket to the general passenger area was\na reasonable judgment under 28 C.F.R. § 36.208 was properly\nmade on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.\nAll the evidence as to what the CCE employees knew on Sep-\ntember 2, 2002 was before the district court. Lockett does not\nallege that she was precluded from presenting relevant evi-\ndence. Instead, on appeal, she argues that the district court\nshould have granted her summary judgment on the liability\nissue. We agree with the district court that the evidence\nrequired a finding that CCE’s decision on September 2, 2002\nto relegate Lockett to the general passenger area was a reason-\nable judgment under 28 C.F.R. § 36.208. Accordingly, on this\nground only, the district court’s order is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nHALL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   Because I find that Catalina Channel Express failed to\nmake the individualized assessment required under the Amer-\nicans with Disabilities Act, and failed to consider whether rea-\nsonable modifications could be made in this individual case,\nI respectfully dissent.\n\f             LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS             9547\n   Under the ADA, a place of public accommodation may\nexclude a disabled individual from a service or opportunity,\nif that individual “poses a direct threat to the health or safety\nof others.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(3). A “direct threat” is\ndefined as “a significant risk to the health or safety of others\nthat cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, prac-\ntices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\nservices.” Id. “When determining whether an individual poses\na ‘direct threat,’ a place of public accommodation must not\nbase its calculus on stereotypes or generalizations about the\neffects of a disability but rather must make ‘an individualized\nassessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on cur-\nrent medical knowledge or on the best available objective evi-\ndence.’ ” Montalvo v. Radcliffe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761711\"><a href=\"/opinion/761711/luciano-montalvo-individually-and-as-the-parent-and-guardian-of-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 877 (4th Cir.\n1999) (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 36.208(c)). This assessment must\nconsider the nature, duration, and severity of the risk. 28\nC.F.R. § 36.208.\n\n   Under this rule, a good faith belief that a risk exists is not\nsufficient. Bragdon v. Abbott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118241\"><a href=\"/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 649 (1998). The\nperson making the relevant decision not to provide the service\nmust base his decision on the objective information available\nto him. See id. In Bragdon, a dentist had declined to see an\nHIV-positive patient on the basis that she would have posed\na risk to the health of others. The Supreme Court used the\nopportunity to elaborate on the “direct threat” standard:\n\n    The existence, or nonexistence, of a significant risk\n    must be determined from the standpoint of the per-\n    son who refuses the treatment or accommodation,\n    and the risk assessment must be based on medical or\n    other objective evidence. As a health care profes-\n    sional, petitioner had the duty to assess the risk of\n    infection based on the objective, scientific informa-\n    tion available to him and others in his profession.\n    His belief that a significant risk existed, even if\n    maintained in good faith, would not relieve him from\n    liability. To use the words of the question presented,\n\f9548         LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\n    petitioner receives no special deference simply\n    because he is a health care professional.\n\nId. However, the Court has previously held that medical judg-\nments based on the duration, severity and nature of the risk\nare entitled to deference. See School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v.\nArline, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111832\"><a href=\"/opinion/111832/school-bd-of-nassau-cty-v-arline/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (1987).\n\n   The risk to others must also be “significant.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12182(b)(3). The ADA’s statutory language regarding the\nthreat to others was adopted from Arline, a case dealing with\ninfectious disease. See Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649 (discussing\nthe influence of Arline). As the Court acknowledged, “Arline\nand the ADA do not ask whether a risk exists, but whether it\nis significant.” Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. In Doe v. District\nof Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1559185\"><a href=\"/opinion/1559185/doe-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 1992), for example,\nthe district court held that hiring an HIV-positive firefighter\nwould pose no “measurable risk” of infection to other fire-\nfighters or the public. Id. at 569.\n\n   The ADA’s required analysis does not end, however, with\na finding of significant risk. If it finds such a threat, the ser-\nvice provider must then ascertain “whether reasonable modifi-\ncations of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the\nrisk, to the point of eliminating it as a significant risk.” Mon-\ntalvo, 167 F.3d at 877 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 36.208(c) and 42\nU.S.C.§ 12182(b)(3))(internal punctuation omitted). As the\nFourth Circuit explained in Montalvo, one of the few appel-\nlate decisions dealing with these provisions, “a failure to\nmake a reasonable modification is itself an act of discrimina-\ntion unless the place of public accommodation can demon-\nstrate that implementing the modification would\nfundamentally alter the nature of the program.” Id.\n\n  The interaction between Lockett and Catalina Channel\nExpress falls far short of this statutory procedure. First, CCE\nmade no “individualized assessment” as to the health effects\nof bringing Lockett’s dog aboard. Though it had limited\n\f             LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS             9549\nobjective evidence, it could have investigated whether the\nfemale passenger who had complained about dander was in\nfact on the ship, or whether there were other allergic passen-\ngers in the lounge. Though CCE did not appear to act with\nmalice, pure intentions and good faith are not sufficient under\nthe ADA.\n\n   Second, the risk to others was not found, objectively, to be\nsignificant. The frequent passenger who allegedly requested a\ndander-free environment (a passenger who was never\ndeposed, let alone named, by CCE) did not suggest this policy\nwas necessary as a matter of serious public health concern,\nalong the lines of an infectious disease. It bears repeating that\nCCE never determined whether any allergic passenger would\neven be in the lounge area.\n\n   The opinion in this case treats the decision about Lockett\nas an individualized assessment, but it appears that the ticket\nagent was simply applying CCE’s policy as a matter of reflex.\nUnder the ADA, the standard for judging the application of a\npolicy is the same as the standard for one-time action: “Safety\nrequirements must be based on actual risks and not on mere\nspeculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals\nwith disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. 36.301. In Leiken v. Squaw Val-\nley Ski Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">494298</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 A.D. Cases 945 (E.D. Cal.\n1994), the district court granted a preliminary injunction\nagainst a ski resort’s policy of barring wheelchairs from the\ncable car used to access a high-altitude recreation area. The\nresort had justified the policy on the grounds that wheelchairs\nwould hinder any emergency evacuation of the cable car. The\ndistrict court held that the ski resort “cannot justify its policy\nas a series of individual safety-based exclusions because it has\nnot performed individualized risk assessments.” Id.; see also\nBombrys v. City of Toledo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2139922\"><a href=\"/opinion/2139922/bombrys-v-city-of-toledo/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1216 (N.D.\nOhio 1993); Anderson v. Little League Baseball, Inc., 794 F.\nSupp. 342, 345 (D. Ariz. 1992). As in these cases, CCE made\na blanket policy and applied it to Lockett without considering\nthe individual facts of her case.\n\f9550         LOCKETT v. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS\n   Finally, CCE’s employees did not investigate whether a\n“reasonable modification” would neutralize any health threat.\nThough the lounge was allegedly the only area where allergic\npassengers could be segregated from animals, CCE did not\ninvestigate whether there were in fact other allergic passen-\ngers aboard, whether any passengers could be persuaded to sit\nelsewhere, or whether Lockett could be seated in any particu-\nlar part of the lounge where the dog’s dander would pose the\nleast risk.\n\n   Though it was no doubt wise and well-intentioned for CCE\nto eliminate this policy following the Lockett incident, this\nchange of course does not remedy whatever damage Lockett\nalleges from the initial violation. Any sentiment that her claim\nis too small to be worthwhile, or that CCE should not be pun-\nished when it has acted admirably otherwise, is an issue best\nleft to the jury when determining damages. Accordingly, I\ndissent.\n\f</pre>",
