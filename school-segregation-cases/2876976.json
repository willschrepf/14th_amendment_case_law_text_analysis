In January 2004, Mayor James announced\nthat “[w]e have created a rainbow at each firehouse.” (Pl. App.\nat 74). The firefighters sued, and lost.\n\n        It is important at the outset to note what this case is not\nabout. This case is not about whether diverse workplaces are\ndesirable. It is not disputed that they are. Neither is this case\nabout a remedy for unlawful past discrimination because, again,\nit is not disputed that there was no unlawful discrimination in the\npast. And this case is not about whether the numbers of minority\nfirefighters being hired are satisfying long-range hiring goals.\nRather, this case is about whether the City of Newark may\nemploy a race-based transfer and assignment policy when any\nracial imbalance in the 108 fire companies is not the result of\npast intentional discrimination by the City. We hold that it may\nnot and, accordingly, will reverse the District Court’s entry of\n\n\n       1\n          Mayor James used the term “fire houses,” but there is no\nevidence that there were any single-race fire houses in Newark,\nand it became clear that the mandate was directed to the 108 fire\ncompanies. Each of the fire companies is made up of three or\nfour firefighters working under the supervision of a fire captain\nin a fire house. Each company works a designated shift known\nas a tour. The parties use the terms “company” and “tour” to\nrefer to the small group of firefighters working together on a\nparticular shift. We will refer to these groups as “companies.”\n                                3\n\fjudgment for the defendants.\n\n    I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        In 1977, the United States filed a complaint against the\nState of New Jersey, several New Jersey officials, the City of\nNewark, and eleven other New Jersey cities alleging “a pattern\nor practice of discrimination” in the hiring and promotion of\nminority firefighters. A Consent Decree resolving the United\nStates’ claims was approved and entered by the District Court in\n1980. The Consent Decree did not contain a finding that any\nunlawful discrimination had occurred, but did require the various\ndefendants “to undertake affirmative action to increase\nsubstantially the proportion of black and Hispanic personnel on\ntheir respective fire departments.” With respect to the Newark\nFire Department, the Decree called for an interim goal of at least\n60% of all vacancies to be filled with qualified minority\ncandidates.\n\n         Fifteen years passed, and in 1995, the Newark City\nCouncil hired Samuel Rosenfarb, a certified public accountant,\nto “determine [statistical] compliance with [the 1980] consent\ndecree.” (Supp. App. at 90.) Rosenfarb reported his findings to\nthe Council in a December 1995 report, which indicated that\n68.8% of the Fire Department’s uniformed employees were\nwhite, 24% were black, and 6.9% were Hispanic. He also\nreported that of 195 promotions granted between 1980 and 1994,\n168 were given to white employees, twenty-four to black\nemployees and three to Hispanic employees. In conducting his\nanalysis, Rosenfarb noticed that “the [companies] were\nsignificantly homogenous either black or white.” (Id.) His\nreport noted that 81 of the 108 companies “had a majority of\nwhite personnel with 30 being comprised entirely of white\npersonnel. Fifteen of the [companies] were predominantly black\n. . . . Only one . . . had a majority of hispanics. The remaining\neleven [companies] did not contain a majority of any one group.”\n(Pl. App. at 124.)2\n\n\n       2\n        Also in 1995, the Council retained Lesli Baskerville, an\nattorney, “for the purpose of examining legal documents relating\n                                4\n\f         The City took no action with respect to the existence of\nsingle-race fire companies for another seven years. Then, in July\n2002, Mayor James, apparently out of the blue, ordered that all\nfire houses, i.e., companies, in the Newark Fire Department be\nintegrated “to improve morale” and “to honor a court order to\nmake our Fire Department the mirror of the City of Newark . . .\n.” (Id. at 55). With reference to the former, we note, there is no\nevidence that morale needed improving; with reference to the\nlatter, the by-then twenty-two year old Consent Decree required\nno such thing.\n\n        The Mayor appointed the Department’s former\nAffirmative Action Specialist, Edward Dunham, as the new\nDirector of the Fire Department, and charged him with\nimplementing this “diversification order.” (Id. at 54.) Dunham,\nin turn, directed Fire Chief Lowell Jones to diversify the fire\ncompanies. In a November 27, 2002 letter to Chief Jones,\nDunham directed Jones to “formulate a mass departmental\ntransfer list.” (Id. at 56.) Jones did so, and in so doing, “tried to\nachieve an element of diversity as well as assign department\npersonnel as per their specialized training.” (Id. at 57.) He also\nconsidered the “need to maintain a high degree of readiness in\n[the] face of world and/or domestic terrorist threats.” (Id.) In\nhis memorandum to Dunham, he noted that “[u]nits that have\nbeen training together and that have achieved a high level of\nefficiency [were] maintained and where we could comply with\ndiversity we did so.”3 (Id.)\n\n\n\nto the Consent Decree.” (Pl. App. at 170.) Her report was not\nadmitted into evidence, its only purpose being to show what\naction, if any, the City and the Fire Department took in response\nthereto. Accordingly, and unlike the District Court, we neither\nnote nor rely on any of the factual allegations contained in the\nreport.\n       3\n         In his testimony at trial, Jones indicated that he used the\n“probationary firefighters that came out of the training division,\nas well as some of the [voluntary] transfer requests that were\nmade, to try to incorporate an element of diversity.” (Supp.\nApp. at 37-38; Pl. App. at 242.) His list did not include any\n                                  5\n\f       Dunham asked Battalion Chief Raymond Wallace to\nreview Jones’s list, and Wallace determined that the list would\nnot achieve the mandated diversity. He noted in a memorandum\nto Dunham that “[i]f Chief Jones transfer list were to be used,\nthere would be 14 companies all Caucasian and 10 companies\nAfrican American. . . . This list does not meet the directive and\nis unsatisfactory.” (Id. at 61 (emphasis in original).)\nAccordingly, Wallace proposed an alternative transfer list that\nwould achieve 100% diversity. Dunham accepted Wallace’s\nproposal. On January 15, 2003, Dunham issued “Executive\nOrder No. 426—Transfers & Assignments,” in which he\nannounced a list of transfers “effective at 0800 hours on Friday,\nJanuary 31, 2003,” and stated that “[f]uture transfer requests will\nnot be accepted until further notice.” (Id. at 67-70.)\n\n       Thirty-four firefighters who were involuntarily\ntransferred or denied requests to transfer due to the new policy,\ntogether with the Newark Firefighters Union and the Newark\nFire Officers Union, brought this action against the City of\nNewark, Mayor James, and three officials of the Newark Fire\nDepartment, challenging the constitutionality of the policy under\nthe Equal Protection Clause; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.; and the New Jersey Civil\nRights Act, N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 & 10-6:2. Following a bench trial,\nthe District Court dismissed their claims and entered judgment\nfor defendants. This timely appeal followed.\n\n    II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1291. Because the diversity policy is a race-based\nclassification, it must pass strict scrutiny: it must be narrowly\ntailored to achieve a compelling state interest. See Johnson v.\nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499, 506 (2005) (explaining that “‘racial\nclassifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be\nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.’”) (quoting Shaw v.\nReno, 509 U.S. 630, 651 (1993)). The District Court found that\nthe policy satisfied both prongs of this test. We review the\n\n\ninvoluntary transfers.\n                                6\n\fDistrict Court’s findings of fact for clear error. Contractors\nAss’n of Eastern Pa. v. City of Philadelphia, 91 F.3d 586, 596\n(3d Cir. 1996). The existence of a compelling state interest,\nhowever, is a question of law that is subject to plenary review.\nId.\n\n                          III. ANALYSIS\n\n        The City argues that it has three somewhat interwoven\ncompelling interests in implementing the diversity policy. First,\nit argues that it has a compelling interest in eliminating de facto\nsegregation in the Fire Department. Second, it contends that\nthere is a compelling interest in securing the “educational,\nsociological and job performance” benefits of diverse fire\ncompanies. Finally, it argues that the policy is required by the\n1980 Consent Decree, compliance with which constitutes a\ncompelling interest. As we have already suggested, we are not\npersuaded by these arguments. We will address each in turn.\n\n       1. Remedying Past Discrimination\n\n        It is well settled that a government has a compelling\ninterest in remedying its own past discrimination. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 167 (1987).\nAccordingly, it may employ racial classifications to cure racial\nimbalances—but only if it can prove that it engaged in prior\nintentional discrimination or was a “passive participant” in a\nthird party’s discrimination. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488\nU.S. 469, 492 (1989). “[R]ace-based preferences cannot be\njustified by reference to past ‘societal’ discrimination in which\nthe municipality played no material role.” Contractors Ass’n, 91\nF.3d at 596; see also Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 909-12 (1996)\n(rejecting racial classifications to “alleviate the effects of societal\ndiscrimination” in the absence of findings of past discrimination,\nand to promote minority representation in Congress); Richmond,\n488 U.S. at 511 (1989); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476\nU.S. 267, 274-76 (1986) (rejecting racial classifications in a\nteacher layoff policy aimed at providing minority role models for\nstudents and alleviating past societal discrimination).\n\n       The City does not even suggest that it participated,\n\n                                  7\n\fdirectly or passively, in any form of discrimination; indeed, it\nconcedes that it neither intentionally discriminated against\nminority firefighters with respect to assignments or transfers, nor\nintentionally segregated firefighters into racially homogeneous\ncompanies. Moreover, the City concedes that single race fire\ncompanies resulted, not from “Fire Department management,”\nbut from the “tendency on the part of management to allow\npeople to work where they choose to work,” and to\naccommodate their desire to work in the neighborhoods where\nthey live. (Pl. App. at 334, 335). Accordingly, the remedial\njustification for the use of racial classifications is wholly\ninapplicable here, and the District Court’s finding to the contrary\nis clearly erroneous.\n\n        The City nevertheless argues that it can employ a racial\nclassification to eliminate what it characterizes as “de facto\nsegregation” in the Fire Department. De facto segregation is\ndefined as “[s]egregation which is inadvertent . . . and not caused\nby any state action.” Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed.); see also\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240 (1976) (“‘The\ndifferentiating factor between de jure segregation and so-called\nde facto segregation . . . is purpose or intent to segregate.’”)\n(quoting Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 208 (1973));\nReginald Oh, Race Jurisprudence and the Supreme Court:\nWhere Do We Go From Here?: Discrimination and Distrust, 7\nU. PA. J. CONST. L. 837, 859-860 (2005) (“[D]e facto\nsegregation is considered a ‘nondiscriminatory’ form of\nsegregation.”).4 The City relies on Brown v. Board of\n\n\n       4\n         It has been noted that the term “de facto segregation” is\nsomewhat of an oxymoron because “‘segregate’ is a transitive\nverb [that] requires an actor to do an act which effects\nsegregation.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch.\nDist., 426 F.3d 1162, 1196-97 (9th Cir. 2005) (Bea, J.,\ndissenting); see also id. at 1198 (“It should be remembered . . .\nthat one can no more ‘segregate’ without a person actively doing\nthe segregation than one can separate an egg without a cook.”).\nJudge Bea also noted that this “rhetorical ploy” is “clearly\nunderstandable” since it is “much easier to argue for measures to\nend ‘segregation’ than for measures to end ‘racial imbalance.’\n                                8\n\fEducation, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), to support its assertion that\ngovernment has a compelling interest in eliminating de facto\nsegregation. This reliance is misplaced. Brown involved de jure\n(i.e., intentional) segregation.5 In Brown, and in the later\ndesegregation cases, the Supreme Court held that the\nremediation of de jure segregation justifies the use of a racial\nclassification. This holding has never been extended to\nencompass unintentional – de facto – segregation. Accordingly,\nwhile we agree with the City that the elimination of de facto\nsegregation may well benefit individual employees and society\nat large and is, indeed, a laudable goal, we cannot agree that\ndoing so constitutes a compelling interest that can be achieved\nby means of a racial classification.\n\n      2. Educational and Sociological Benefits of Diverse\nFire Companies\n\n       In Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), the Supreme\nCourt clarified that non-remedial goals may also justify race-\nbased classifications in certain circumstances. Id. at 328 (“It is\ntrue that some language in [earlier] opinions might be read to\nsuggest that remedying past discrimination is the only\npermissible justification for race-based governmental action. . . .\nBut we have never held that the only governmental use of race\nthat can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past\ndiscrimination.”). Specifically, the Grutter Court held—quite\nnarrowly—that the “educational benefits” of a diverse student\n\n\n\nEspecially is this so in view of the U.S. Supreme Court’s\nfrequent pronouncements that ‘racial balancing’ violates the\nEqual Protection Clause.” Id. at 1197, 1198.\n       5\n         In direct contrast to de facto segregation, “[t]he essential\nelement of de jure segregation is ‘a current condition of\nsegregation resulting from intentional state action.’”\nWashington, 426 U.S. at 240 (quoting Keyes,, 413 U.S. at 205);\nsee also 3 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowack, Treatise on\nConstitutional Law § 18.9(2)(1) (3d ed. 1999) (“De jure (‘by\nlaw’) segregation is racial separation which is the product of\nsome purposeful act by government authorities.”).\n                                 9\n\fbody are a sufficiently compelling interest to justify race-based\nenhancements of minority students’ applications to law school.6\nId. at 328-33.\n\n        The City argues that it has a compelling interest in\nintegrating its fire companies because “integration in the\nworkplace is no less important than in an educational setting.”\n(Appellees’ Br. at 30.) Specifically, it contends that\n“integration in fire companies leads to greater camaraderie\nbetween coworkers, acceptance and consideration for people of\nvarying backgrounds, sharing of information and study support.\nIt also promotes tolerance and mutual respect among\ncolleagues.” (Id.) The District Court agreed, as do we, but\nwent on to find that the “educational, sociological, and job-\nperformance enhancements” supported, if not by themselves\ncompelled, the diversity policy. With that, we disagree.\n\n       Initially we note that the under-inclusiveness of the\ndiversity policy, specifically its failure to consider gender, other\nethnic groups, age, or socio-economic class, seems to belie\nNewark’s claim that “educational benefits” were its actual\npurpose.7 It bears mention, as well, that neither Mayor James\nnor the Fire Department officials called upon to implement the\n\n\n       6\n           The Court accepted the argument of the school and\nvarious amici that the University of Michigan Law School\nneeded to enroll a “critical mass” of minority students in order to\nfulfill its educational mission and prepare students for successful\ncareers in an increasingly diverse workforce. Id. at 330. The\nCourt agreed that it was essential for students to be exposed to\n“widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,” id., and\nthat it was “necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open\nto talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity”\nin order to “cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes\nof the citizenry,” id. at 332.\n       7\n         “To be a compelling interest, the State must show that\nthe alleged objective was the legislature’s actual purpose for the\ndiscriminatory classification.” Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 908\nn.4 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n                                 10\n\fdiversity policy referred to “educational benefits” or anything\nakin thereto as a reason for the policy. By accepting educational\nbenefits as an interest compelling the policy, however, the\nDistrict Court, at least implicitly, found that that was the City’s\n“actual purpose,” or at least one of its purposes.\n\n       We need not resolve whether or not the District Court’s\nfinding was clearly erroneous, because even if the alleged\n“educational benefits” were an “actual purpose,” they do not\nconstitute a compelling interest in the circumstances presented\nby this case. While Grutter established that educational benefits\nare compelling in a law school context, we do not find its\nholding applicable in the firefighting context. See Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 327 (“Context matters when reviewing race-based\ngovernmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.”).\n\n        The “relevant difference,” id., between a law school and a\nfire department is their respective missions. The mission of a\nschool is to educate students, “prepar[e] students for work and\ncitizenship,” and cultivate future leaders. Id. at 331, 332. The\nGrutter Court found, based on extensive testimony and other\nevidence, that a “critical mass” of diverse students was necessary\nfor the University of Michigan Law School to effectively\nachieve this mission. But Grutter does not stand for the\nproposition that the educational benefits of diversity are always a\ncompelling interest, regardless of the context. Rather, it stands\nfor the narrow premise that the educational benefits of diversity\ncan be a compelling interest to an institution whose mission is to\neducate.\n\n        The Fire Department’s mission is not to educate. Its\nmission is “the control, fighting and extinguishment of any\nconflagration which occurs within the city limits.” Newark, N.J.\nGeneral Ordinances v. I, tit. II, ch. 21, § 1.2 (2005).\nAccordingly, Grutter’s holding regarding a compelling interest\nin the educational benefits of diversity is unavailing here. And,\nwe note, the City does not argue that diversity within individual\nfire companies is in any other way necessary, or even beneficial,\nto the Fire Department’s mission of fighting fires, i.e., that the\n\n\n\n                                11\n\fDepartment has an operational need for diverse fire companies,8\nand we do not read the City’s assertions of increased\n“camaraderie,” “acceptance,” and “tolerance” as making such an\nargument. Even if we were to liberally construe those assertions\nas an operational needs argument, however, utterly no evidence\nsupports it. See Patrolmen’s Benevolent Ass’n, 310 F.3d at 52-\n53 (citations omitted) (“[C]ourts recognizing the [operational\nneeds] defense have required the government actor to\ndemonstrate that it is ‘motivated by a truly powerful and worthy\nconcern and that the racial measure . . . adopted is a plainly apt\nresponse to that concern.’ The justification must be\nsubstantiated by objective evidence . . . .”).\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the benefits of diversity, as set\nforth by the City, are not a compelling interest that justifies its\ndiversity policy.\n\n       3. Compliance With the 1980 Consent Decree\n\n      The City also argues that compliance with the 1980\nConsent Decree constitutes a compelling interest. This, too, is\nunavailing. Compliance with a consent decree may certainly be\na compelling interest, see Citizens Concerned About Our\nChildren v. Sch. Bd. of Broward County, Florida, 193 F.3d\n\n\n       8\n         Courts have found such “operational needs” arguments\nto be persuasive in the law enforcement context. See, e.g., Petit\nv. City of Chicago, 352 F.3d 1111, 1114 (7th Cir. 2004) (finding\na “compelling operational need for a diverse police department”\nin a “racially and ethnically divided major American city”);\nPatrolmen’s Benevolent Ass’n v. New York, 310 F.3d 43, 52 (2d\nCir. 2002) (“We have recognized that ‘a law enforcement body’s\nneed to carry out its mission effectively, with a workforce that\nappears unbiased, is able to communicate with the public and is\nrespected by the community it serves,’ may constitute a\ncompelling state interest.”). In a sense, Grutter could itself be\ncharacterized as an “operational needs” opinion. The Supreme\nCourt essentially found that law schools have an operational\nneed for a diverse student body in order to effectively achieve\ntheir educational mission.\n                                 12\n\f1285, 1292-94 (11th Cir. 1999) (explaining that violation of a\nconsent decree “is punishable by contempt,” and “[a]voiding\ncontempt and respecting the court that entered the consent\ndecree suffice to make obedience a compelling interest”), but\nonly if the decree mandates the race-based policy at issue:\n\n       When the compelling interest is compliance with a\n       court order, that means that the governmental\n       entity must face a likelihood of contempt under the\n       order if it abandons the racial policy. The reason is\n       obvious: any policy that exceeds the bare\n       requirements of the order no longer closely fits the\n       compelling interest because abandoning the policy\n       is consistent with respecting the court, avoiding\n       contempt liability, and righting the wrongs\n       underlying the decree.\n\nId. at 1293.\n\n        The Consent Decree says nothing about the diversity\npolicy at issue here, much less does it require the City to engage\nin that policy. The Decree establishes policies and benchmarks\nfor the hiring and promotion of minority firefighters, with the\nonly language even arguably relevant here found in one\nparagraph of the twelve-page Decree where the defendants were\nprohibited from making unlawfully discriminatory assignments.\nReading a complete diversity requirement into that prohibition,\nhowever, particularly where, as here, it is conceded that there\nwas no unlawful discrimination, would stretch that language\nbeyond its logical or intended limits. Fire Department officials\neffectively admit as much. Stanley Kossup, Director of the Fire\nDepartment from 1988 to 2002, testified that he did not believe\nthat the existence of single-race fire companies violated the\nConsent Decree. Similarly, Edward Dunham, who served as\nDirector of the Fire Department from 2002 to 2004 after serving\nas the Affirmative Action Officer in the late 1990s, testified that\nthe Consent Decree did not mandate the elimination of single-\nrace fire companies and that issue of single-race companies\n“never came up” before the “consent decree committee” on\nwhich he served. (Id. at 308.)\n\n\n                                13\n\f       4. Summary of Compelling Interest\n\n        In the concluding paragraphs of its analysis, the District\nCourt implied that the three interests—remedying past\ndiscrimination, educational and sociological benefits of\ndiversity, and compliance with the Consent Decree—together\nconstitute a compelling interest. (Id. at 34 (“When one ‘strictly\nscrutinizes’ the Newark transfer policy and finds it to be\ndesigned to eliminate de facto segregation in its firehouses, in\npursuit of the mandate of the Consent Decree to which it was a\nparty, with attendant educational, sociological and\njob-performance enhancements as well, one is led to the\ninevitable conclusion that this policy was implemented to\nachieve a ‘compelling interest’ of the City.”).) As explained\nabove, however, we simply cannot conclude that, individually or\nin the aggregate, these interests are compelling.9\n\n                      III. CONCLUSION\n\n        We conclude this opinion as we began, by reiterating\nwhat this case is not about. It is not about remedying intentional\ndiscrimination in the Newark Fire Department. It is not about\nimproving the Department’s ability to extinguish fires. It is not\nabout whether diverse work places are good for employees or for\nsociety or whether long-range hiring goals are being met. This\ncase is about whether Newark can “create[] a rainbow” in each\nof the 108 companies solely by means of a racial classification.\nWe hold that it cannot. Racial balancing, and that is what this is,\nsimply cannot be achieved by means of a racial classification\nwithout running afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nConstitution. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 330 (2003)\n(explaining that “outright racial balancing . . . is patently\nunconstitutional”); see also Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494\n(1992) (“Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake.”).\nAccordingly, we will reverse the order of the District Court, and\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n       9\n         Because we find that the diversity policy does not\nfurther a compelling state interest, we need not determine\nwhether the policy is narrowly tailored.\n                                14\n\f15\n\f",

In January 2004, Mayor James announced\nthat “[w]e have created a rainbow at each firehouse.” (Pl. App.\nat 74). The firefighters sued, and lost.\n\n        It is important at the outset to note what this case is not\nabout. This case is not about whether diverse workplaces are\ndesirable. It is not disputed that they are. Neither is this case\nabout a remedy for unlawful past discrimination because, again,\nit is not disputed that there was no unlawful discrimination in the\npast. And this case is not about whether the numbers of minority\nfirefighters being hired are satisfying long-range hiring goals.\nRather, this case is about whether the City of Newark may\nemploy a race-based transfer and assignment policy when any\nracial imbalance in the 108 fire companies is not the result of\npast intentional discrimination by the City. We hold that it may\nnot and, accordingly, will reverse the District Court’s entry of\n\n\n       1\n          Mayor James used the term “fire houses,” but there is no\nevidence that there were any single-race fire houses in Newark,\nand it became clear that the mandate was directed to the 108 fire\ncompanies. Each of the fire companies is made up of three or\nfour firefighters working under the supervision of a fire captain\nin a fire house. Each company works a designated shift known\nas a tour. The parties use the terms “company” and “tour” to\nrefer to the small group of firefighters working together on a\nparticular shift. We will refer to these groups as “companies.”\n                                3\n\fjudgment for the defendants.\n\n    I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        In 1977, the United States filed a complaint against the\nState of New Jersey, several New Jersey officials, the City of\nNewark, and eleven other New Jersey cities alleging “a pattern\nor practice of discrimination” in the hiring and promotion of\nminority firefighters. A Consent Decree resolving the United\nStates’ claims was approved and entered by the District Court in\n1980. The Consent Decree did not contain a finding that any\nunlawful discrimination had occurred, but did require the various\ndefendants “to undertake affirmative action to increase\nsubstantially the proportion of black and Hispanic personnel on\ntheir respective fire departments.” With respect to the Newark\nFire Department, the Decree called for an interim goal of at least\n60% of all vacancies to be filled with qualified minority\ncandidates.\n\n         Fifteen years passed, and in 1995, the Newark City\nCouncil hired Samuel Rosenfarb, a certified public accountant,\nto “determine [statistical] compliance with [the 1980] consent\ndecree.” (Supp. App. at 90.) Rosenfarb reported his findings to\nthe Council in a December 1995 report, which indicated that\n68.8% of the Fire Department’s uniformed employees were\nwhite, 24% were black, and 6.9% were Hispanic. He also\nreported that of 195 promotions granted between 1980 and 1994,\n168 were given to white employees, twenty-four to black\nemployees and three to Hispanic employees. In conducting his\nanalysis, Rosenfarb noticed that “the [companies] were\nsignificantly homogenous either black or white.” (Id.) His\nreport noted that 81 of the 108 companies “had a majority of\nwhite personnel with 30 being comprised entirely of white\npersonnel. Fifteen of the [companies] were predominantly black\n. . . . Only one . . . had a majority of hispanics. The remaining\neleven [companies] did not contain a majority of any one group.”\n(Pl. App. at 124.)2\n\n\n       2\n        Also in 1995, the Council retained Lesli Baskerville, an\nattorney, “for the purpose of examining legal documents relating\n                                4\n\f         The City took no action with respect to the existence of\nsingle-race fire companies for another seven years. Then, in July\n2002, Mayor James, apparently out of the blue, ordered that all\nfire houses, i.e., companies, in the Newark Fire Department be\nintegrated “to improve morale” and “to honor a court order to\nmake our Fire Department the mirror of the City of Newark . . .\n.” (Id. at 55). With reference to the former, we note, there is no\nevidence that morale needed improving; with reference to the\nlatter, the by-then twenty-two year old Consent Decree required\nno such thing.\n\n        The Mayor appointed the Department’s former\nAffirmative Action Specialist, Edward Dunham, as the new\nDirector of the Fire Department, and charged him with\nimplementing this “diversification order.” (Id. at 54.) Dunham,\nin turn, directed Fire Chief Lowell Jones to diversify the fire\ncompanies. In a November 27, 2002 letter to Chief Jones,\nDunham directed Jones to “formulate a mass departmental\ntransfer list.” (Id. at 56.) Jones did so, and in so doing, “tried to\nachieve an element of diversity as well as assign department\npersonnel as per their specialized training.” (Id. at 57.) He also\nconsidered the “need to maintain a high degree of readiness in\n[the] face of world and/or domestic terrorist threats.” (Id.) In\nhis memorandum to Dunham, he noted that “[u]nits that have\nbeen training together and that have achieved a high level of\nefficiency [were] maintained and where we could comply with\ndiversity we did so.”3 (Id.)\n\n\n\nto the Consent Decree.” (Pl. App. at 170.) Her report was not\nadmitted into evidence, its only purpose being to show what\naction, if any, the City and the Fire Department took in response\nthereto. Accordingly, and unlike the District Court, we neither\nnote nor rely on any of the factual allegations contained in the\nreport.\n       3\n         In his testimony at trial, Jones indicated that he used the\n“probationary firefighters that came out of the training division,\nas well as some of the [voluntary] transfer requests that were\nmade, to try to incorporate an element of diversity.” (Supp.\nApp. at 37-38; Pl. App. at 242.) His list did not include any\n                                  5\n\f       Dunham asked Battalion Chief Raymond Wallace to\nreview Jones’s list, and Wallace determined that the list would\nnot achieve the mandated diversity. He noted in a memorandum\nto Dunham that “[i]f Chief Jones transfer list were to be used,\nthere would be 14 companies all Caucasian and 10 companies\nAfrican American. . . . This list does not meet the directive and\nis unsatisfactory.” (Id. at 61 (emphasis in original).)\nAccordingly, Wallace proposed an alternative transfer list that\nwould achieve 100% diversity. Dunham accepted Wallace’s\nproposal. On January 15, 2003, Dunham issued “Executive\nOrder No. 426—Transfers & Assignments,” in which he\nannounced a list of transfers “effective at 0800 hours on Friday,\nJanuary 31, 2003,” and stated that “[f]uture transfer requests will\nnot be accepted until further notice.” (Id. at 67-70.)\n\n       Thirty-four firefighters who were involuntarily\ntransferred or denied requests to transfer due to the new policy,\ntogether with the Newark Firefighters Union and the Newark\nFire Officers Union, brought this action against the City of\nNewark, Mayor James, and three officials of the Newark Fire\nDepartment, challenging the constitutionality of the policy under\nthe Equal Protection Clause; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.; and the New Jersey Civil\nRights Act, N.J.S.A. 10:6-1 & 10-6:2. Following a bench trial,\nthe District Court dismissed their claims and entered judgment\nfor defendants. This timely appeal followed.\n\n    II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1291. Because the diversity policy is a race-based\nclassification, it must pass strict scrutiny: it must be narrowly\ntailored to achieve a compelling state interest. See Johnson v.\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506 (2005) (explaining that “‘racial\nclassifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be\nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.’”) (quoting Shaw v.\nReno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651 (1993)). The District Court found that\nthe policy satisfied both prongs of this test. We review the\n\n\ninvoluntary transfers.\n                                6\n\fDistrict Court’s findings of fact for clear error. Contractors\nAss’n of Eastern Pa. v. City of Philadelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723768\"><a href=\"/opinion/723768/contractors-association-of-eastern-pennsylvania-inc-general-building/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 596\n(3d Cir. 1996). The existence of a compelling state interest,\nhowever, is a question of law that is subject to plenary review.\nId.\n\n                          III. ANALYSIS\n\n        The City argues that it has three somewhat interwoven\ncompelling interests in implementing the diversity policy. First,\nit argues that it has a compelling interest in eliminating de facto\nsegregation in the Fire Department. Second, it contends that\nthere is a compelling interest in securing the “educational,\nsociological and job performance” benefits of diverse fire\ncompanies. Finally, it argues that the policy is required by the\n1980 Consent Decree, compliance with which constitutes a\ncompelling interest. As we have already suggested, we are not\npersuaded by these arguments. We will address each in turn.\n\n       1. Remedying Past Discrimination\n\n        It is well settled that a government has a compelling\ninterest in remedying its own past discrimination. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Paradise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111827\"><a href=\"/opinion/111827/united-states-v-paradise/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (1987).\nAccordingly, it may employ racial classifications to cure racial\nimbalances—but only if it can prove that it engaged in prior\nintentional discrimination or was a “passive participant” in a\nthird party’s discrimination. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 (1989). “[R]ace-based preferences cannot be\njustified by reference to past ‘societal’ discrimination in which\nthe municipality played no material role.” Contractors Ass’n, 91\nF.3d at 596; see also Shaw v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 909-12 (1996)\n(rejecting racial classifications to “alleviate the effects of societal\ndiscrimination” in the absence of findings of past discrimination,\nand to promote minority representation in Congress); Richmond,\n488 U.S. at 511 (1989); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274-76 (1986) (rejecting racial classifications in a\nteacher layoff policy aimed at providing minority role models for\nstudents and alleviating past societal discrimination).\n\n       The City does not even suggest that it participated,\n\n                                  7\n\fdirectly or passively, in any form of discrimination; indeed, it\nconcedes that it neither intentionally discriminated against\nminority firefighters with respect to assignments or transfers, nor\nintentionally segregated firefighters into racially homogeneous\ncompanies. Moreover, the City concedes that single race fire\ncompanies resulted, not from “Fire Department management,”\nbut from the “tendency on the part of management to allow\npeople to work where they choose to work,” and to\naccommodate their desire to work in the neighborhoods where\nthey live. (Pl. App. at 334, 335). Accordingly, the remedial\njustification for the use of racial classifications is wholly\ninapplicable here, and the District Court’s finding to the contrary\nis clearly erroneous.\n\n        The City nevertheless argues that it can employ a racial\nclassification to eliminate what it characterizes as “de facto\nsegregation” in the Fire Department. De facto segregation is\ndefined as “[s]egregation which is inadvertent . . . and not caused\nby any state action.” Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed.); see also\nWashington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 (1976) (“‘The\ndifferentiating factor between de jure segregation and so-called\nde facto segregation . . . is purpose or intent to segregate.’”)\n(quoting Keyes v.

This reliance is misplaced. Brown involved de jure\n(i.e., intentional) segregation.5 In Brown, and in the later\ndesegregation cases, the Supreme Court held that the\nremediation of de jure segregation justifies the use of a racial\nclassification. This holding has never been extended to\nencompass unintentional – de facto – segregation. Accordingly,\nwhile we agree with the City that the elimination of de facto\nsegregation may well benefit individual employees and society\nat large and is, indeed, a laudable goal, we cannot agree that\ndoing so constitutes a compelling interest that can be achieved\nby means of a racial classification.\n\n      2. Educational and Sociological Benefits of Diverse\nFire Companies\n\n       In Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), the Supreme\nCourt clarified that non-remedial goals may also justify race-\nbased classifications in certain circumstances. Id. at 328 (“It is\ntrue that some language in [earlier] opinions might be read to\nsuggest that remedying past discrimination is the only\npermissible justification for race-based governmental action. . . .\nBut we have never held that the only governmental use of race\nthat can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past\ndiscrimination.”). Specifically, the Grutter Court held—quite\nnarrowly—that the “educational benefits” of a diverse student\n\n\n\nEspecially is this so in view of the U.S. Supreme Court’s\nfrequent pronouncements that ‘racial balancing’ violates the\nEqual Protection Clause.” Id. at 1197, 1198.\n       5\n         In direct contrast to de facto segregation, “[t]he essential\nelement of de jure segregation is ‘a current condition of\nsegregation resulting from intentional state action.’”\nWashington, 426 U.S. at 240 (quoting Keyes,, 413 U.S. at 205);\nsee also 3 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowack, Treatise on\nConstitutional Law § 18.9(2)(1) (3d ed. 1999) (“De jure (‘by\nlaw’) segregation is racial separation which is the product of\nsome purposeful act by government authorities.”).\n                                 9\n\fbody are a sufficiently compelling interest to justify race-based\nenhancements of minority students’ applications to law school.6\nId. at 328-33.\n\n        The City argues that it has a compelling interest in\nintegrating its fire companies because “integration in the\nworkplace is no less important than in an educational setting.”\n(Appellees’ Br. at 30.) Specifically, it contends that\n“integration in fire companies leads to greater camaraderie\nbetween coworkers, acceptance and consideration for people of\nvarying backgrounds, sharing of information and study support.\nIt also promotes tolerance and mutual respect among\ncolleagues.” (Id.) The District Court agreed, as do we, but\nwent on to find that the “educational, sociological, and job-\nperformance enhancements” supported, if not by themselves\ncompelled, the diversity policy. With that, we disagree.\n\n       Initially we note that the under-inclusiveness of the\ndiversity policy, specifically its failure to consider gender, other\nethnic groups, age, or socio-economic class, seems to belie\nNewark’s claim that “educational benefits” were its actual\npurpose.7 It bears mention, as well, that neither Mayor James\nnor the Fire Department officials called upon to implement the\n\n\n       6\n           The Court accepted the argument of the school and\nvarious amici that the University of Michigan Law School\nneeded to enroll a “critical mass” of minority students in order to\nfulfill its educational mission and prepare students for successful\ncareers in an increasingly diverse workforce. Id. at 330. The\nCourt agreed that it was essential for students to be exposed to\n“widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,” id., and\nthat it was “necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open\nto talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity”\nin order to “cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes\nof the citizenry,” id. at 332.\n       7\n         “To be a compelling interest, the State must show that\nthe alleged objective was the legislature’s actual purpose for the\ndiscriminatory classification.” Shaw v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 908\nn.4 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n                                 10\n\fdiversity policy referred to “educational benefits” or anything\nakin thereto as a reason for the policy. By accepting educational\nbenefits as an interest compelling the policy, however, the\nDistrict Court, at least implicitly, found that that was the City’s\n“actual purpose,” or at least one of its purposes.\n\n       We need not resolve whether or not the District Court’s\nfinding was clearly erroneous, because even if the alleged\n“educational benefits” were an “actual purpose,” they do not\nconstitute a compelling interest in the circumstances presented\nby this case. While Grutter established that educational benefits\nare compelling in a law school context, we do not find its\nholding applicable in the firefighting context. See Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 327 (“Context matters when reviewing race-based\ngovernmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.”).\n\n        The “relevant difference,” id., between a law school and a\nfire department is their respective missions. The mission of a\nschool is to educate students, “prepar[e] students for work and\ncitizenship,” and cultivate future leaders. Id. at 331, 332. The\nGrutter Court found, based on extensive testimony and other\nevidence, that a “critical mass” of diverse students was necessary\nfor the University of Michigan Law School to effectively\nachieve this mission. But Grutter does not stand for the\nproposition that the educational benefits of diversity are always a\ncompelling interest, regardless of the context. Rather, it stands\nfor the narrow premise that the educational benefits of diversity\ncan be a compelling interest to an institution whose mission is to\neducate.\n\n        The Fire Department’s mission is not to educate. Its\nmission is “the control, fighting and extinguishment of any\nconflagration which occurs within the city limits.” Newark, N.J.\nGeneral Ordinances v. I, tit. II, ch. 21, § 1.2 (2005).\nAccordingly, Grutter’s holding regarding a compelling interest\nin the educational benefits of diversity is unavailing here. And,\nwe note, the City does not argue that diversity within individual\nfire companies is in any other way necessary, or even beneficial,\nto the Fire Department’s mission of fighting fires, i.e., that the\n\n\n\n                                11\n\fDepartment has an operational need for diverse fire companies,8\nand we do not read the City’s assertions of increased\n“camaraderie,” “acceptance,” and “tolerance” as making such an\nargument. Even if we were to liberally construe those assertions\nas an operational needs argument, however, utterly no evidence\nsupports it. See Patrolmen’s Benevolent Ass’n, 310 F.3d at 52-\n53 (citations omitted) (“[C]ourts recognizing the [operational\nneeds] defense have required the government actor to\ndemonstrate that it is ‘motivated by a truly powerful and worthy\nconcern and that the racial measure . . . adopted is a plainly apt\nresponse to that concern.’ The justification must be\nsubstantiated by objective evidence . . . .”).\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the benefits of diversity, as set\nforth by the City, are not a compelling interest that justifies its\ndiversity policy.\n\n       3. Compliance With the 1980 Consent Decree\n\n      The City also argues that compliance with the 1980\nConsent Decree constitutes a compelling interest. This, too, is\nunavailing. Compliance with a consent decree may certainly be\na compelling interest, see Citizens Concerned About Our\nChildren v. Sch.

In a sense, Grutter could itself be\ncharacterized as an “operational needs” opinion. The Supreme\nCourt essentially found that law schools have an operational\nneed for a diverse student body in order to effectively achieve\ntheir educational mission.\n                                 12\n\f1285, 1292-94 (11th Cir. 1999) (explaining that violation of a\nconsent decree “is punishable by contempt,” and “[a]voiding\ncontempt and respecting the court that entered the consent\ndecree suffice to make obedience a compelling interest”), but\nonly if the decree mandates the race-based policy at issue:\n\n       When the compelling interest is compliance with a\n       court order, that means that the governmental\n       entity must face a likelihood of contempt under the\n       order if it abandons the racial policy. The reason is\n       obvious: any policy that exceeds the bare\n       requirements of the order no longer closely fits the\n       compelling interest because abandoning the policy\n       is consistent with respecting the court, avoiding\n       contempt liability, and righting the wrongs\n       underlying the decree.\n\nId. at 1293.\n\n        The Consent Decree says nothing about the diversity\npolicy at issue here, much less does it require the City to engage\nin that policy. The Decree establishes policies and benchmarks\nfor the hiring and promotion of minority firefighters, with the\nonly language even arguably relevant here found in one\nparagraph of the twelve-page Decree where the defendants were\nprohibited from making unlawfully discriminatory assignments.\nReading a complete diversity requirement into that prohibition,\nhowever, particularly where, as here, it is conceded that there\nwas no unlawful discrimination, would stretch that language\nbeyond its logical or intended limits. Fire Department officials\neffectively admit as much. Stanley Kossup, Director of the Fire\nDepartment from 1988 to 2002, testified that he did not believe\nthat the existence of single-race fire companies violated the\nConsent Decree. Similarly, Edward Dunham, who served as\nDirector of the Fire Department from 2002 to 2004 after serving\nas the Affirmative Action Officer in the late 1990s, testified that\nthe Consent Decree did not mandate the elimination of single-\nrace fire companies and that issue of single-race companies\n“never came up” before the “consent decree committee” on\nwhich he served. (Id. at 308.)\n\n\n                                13\n\f       4. Summary of Compelling Interest\n\n        In the concluding paragraphs of its analysis, the District\nCourt implied that the three interests—remedying past\ndiscrimination, educational and sociological benefits of\ndiversity, and compliance with the Consent Decree—together\nconstitute a compelling interest. (Id. at 34 (“When one ‘strictly\nscrutinizes’ the Newark transfer policy and finds it to be\ndesigned to eliminate de facto segregation in its firehouses, in\npursuit of the mandate of the Consent Decree to which it was a\nparty, with attendant educational, sociological and\njob-performance enhancements as well, one is led to the\ninevitable conclusion that this policy was implemented to\nachieve a ‘compelling interest’ of the City.”).) As explained\nabove, however, we simply cannot conclude that, individually or\nin the aggregate, these interests are compelling.9\n\n                      III. CONCLUSION\n\n        We conclude this opinion as we began, by reiterating\nwhat this case is not about. It is not about remedying intentional\ndiscrimination in the Newark Fire Department. It is not about\nimproving the Department’s ability to extinguish fires. It is not\nabout whether diverse work places are good for employees or for\nsociety or whether long-range hiring goals are being met. This\ncase is about whether Newark can “create[] a rainbow” in each\nof the 108 companies solely by means of a racial classification.\nWe hold that it cannot. Racial balancing, and that is what this is,\nsimply cannot be achieved by means of a racial classification\nwithout running afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nConstitution. Grutter v.
