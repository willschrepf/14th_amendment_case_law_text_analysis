See Complaint (“Compl.”) ¶ 1.\n\nCurrently pending before the Court are the Department of Justice’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment (“Def.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 12, the Cause of Action Institute’s Response to Department\n\nof Justice’s Motion for Summary Judg[]ment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (“Pl.’s\n\nSumm.

Upon careful consideration of the parties’\n\nsubmissions,1 the Court concludes for the reasons set forth below that it must deny the Institute’s\n\nmotion to amend its Complaint, grant the Department’s motion for summary judgment, and deny\n\n\n1\n In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its\ndecision: (1) the Department’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“Def.’s Facts”); (2) the Plaintiff’s Statement\nof Undisputed Material Facts (“Pl.’s Facts”); (3) the Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant Department of Justice’s\nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts (“Pl.’s Resp.”); (4) The Department of Justice’s Reply on Motion for\nSummary Judgment and Opposition to COA’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (“Def.’s Reply”); (5) the Cause\nof Action Institute’s Reply in Support of Its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (“Pl.’s Summ.

Reply”); (6) The\nDepartment of Justice’s Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend Complaint (“Def.’s Opp’n”); and (7) the Cause\nof Action Institute’s Reply in Support of Its Motion for Leave to Amend Its Complaint (“Pl.’s Reply”).\n\fthe Institute’s cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                            I.       BACKGROUND\n\n         On July 15, 2016, the Institute sent a FOIA request by letter to the Department’s Tax\n\nDivision (the “Division”), “seeking production of two specific records relating to the detailing of\n\n[Department] attorneys to the White House.” Compl. ¶ 6. First, the Institute sought “an email\n\nchain involving two government employees (the ‘Bringer-Wolfinger email chain’) . . . [that was\n\nsubmitted in] May 2014.” Id. ¶ 9. Second, the Institute sought “a November 2011 report entitled\n\nthe Current Practices for Attorney Assignments, Transfers, and Details” to the White House.\n\nPl.’s Facts ¶ 4; Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 3–4. The Division had previously produced these two specific\n\nrecords “in response to another . . . FOIA request” made by the Institute. Pl.’s Facts ¶ 2.\n\nHowever, the Division “had withheld large portions of those records by applying ‘NR’ or\n\n‘Non-Responsive’ labels to the redactions.” Id.; see also Compl. ¶ 7. Thus, in its July 15, 2016\n\nFOIA request, the Institute sought the two requested records in their entirety, without any\n\nnon-responsive redactions. See Compl. ¶ 8.\n\n         “By letter [] dated August 9, 2016, [the Division] acknowledged receipt of the\n\n[Institute’s] July 15, 2016 FOIA request . . . and requested a conference to clarify the scope of\n\nthe request.” Id. ¶ 11. On August 15, 2016, the parties “held a [tele]phone conference,” during\n\nwhich the Institute explained that the use of “non-responsive” as a label to redact information\n\nwas an improper “withholding tool” and clarified that it sought only the two records in their\n\nentirety. Id. ¶ 12; see also Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 2–6. On September 20, 2016, the Division issued its\n\nfinal decision regarding the Institute’s July 15, 2016 FOIA request as clarified, producing in its\n\nentirety the November 2011 report, without any redactions. See Def.’s Facts ¶ 7; Pl.’s Facts ¶ 7. 2\n\n\n2\n  The Institute does not challenge the Department’s “processing of this record,” and this “record is not part of the\ninstant litigation.” Pl.’s Facts ¶ 7.\n\n                                                           2\n\fHowever, the Division subdivided the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain into nine separate records\n\nand redacted “Record 7” on the basis of Exemptions 3 and 5 of the FOIA and the remaining\n\nrecords as non-responsive. Pl.’s Facts ¶ 8; Compl. ¶ 17.\n\n         The Institute initiated this action by filing its Complaint on November 8, 2016, see\n\nCompl. at 1, alleging that the Department “improperly segmented the Bringer-Wolfinger email\n\nchain into nine distinct ‘records’ and improperly applied a ‘non-responsive’ designation to\n\nwithhold eight of those ‘records,’” id. ¶ 30. 3 Thereafter, on January 12, 2017, the Department\n\nupdated its policy regarding what constitutes a “record” under the FOIA, in which it urged\n\nagencies to “use the definition of [the term] record found in the Privacy Act,” meaning that “each\n\n‘item, collection, or grouping of information’ on the topic of the request can be considered a\n\ndistinct ‘record.’” Pl.’s Mot. to Amend, Exhibit (“Ex.”) J (OIP Guidance: Defining a “Record”\n\nUnder the FOIA (the “Guidance”)) at 3. Later, on January 18, 2017, the Division re-processed\n\nthe Bringer-Wolfinger email chain and re-produced the record to the Institute “as a single\n\nrecord,” withdrawing all of the “non-responsive” redactions, but “redact[ing] significant portions\n\nof responsive material” pursuant to FOIA exemptions 3, 5, 6, 7(A), and 7(C). Pl.’s Facts ¶ 11;\n\nsee also Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 9–11.\n\n         The Department now moves for summary judgment, asserting that its redactions of the\n\nre-processed and re-produced Bringer-Wolfinger email chain were proper, as those contents were\n\nexempt from disclosure under several FOIA exemptions. See Def.’s Mot. at 3. And, given that\n\nthe Department re-produced the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain as one record, and because the\n\nDepartment asserts that withholding portions of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain is proper\n\n3\n  Prior to filing this lawsuit, the Institute filed an administrative appeal with the Department’s Office of Information\nPolicy (the “Office”), challenging the Department’s withholdings of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain. See Pl.’s\nFacts ¶ 9. Although the Office acknowledged receipt of the Institute’s appeal, it never ruled on the appeal. See id.\n¶ 10.\n\n\n                                                           3\n\fpursuant to specific FOIA exemptions and not because they are “non-responsive,” the\n\nDepartment contends that the issue of “whether the email chain constitutes one record or several\n\nrecords” is now “moot.” Def.’s Mot. at 15. On February 8, 2017, the Institute simultaneously\n\nopposed the Department’s motion and cross-moved for summary judgment, see Pl.’s Summ. J.\n\nMot. at 1, arguing that “its claim against the [Department] for using ‘non-responsive’ as a\n\nredaction tool and improperly segmenting one record into multiple records is not moot,” id. at\n\n18. The Institute, however, did not oppose the Department’s motion “as to its application of\n\nexemptions and redactions in the January 18, 2017 production” of the re-processed\n\nBringer-Wolfinger email chain. Id. at 8. In response, the Department maintains its position that\n\nthis case is now moot, see Def.’s Reply at 1, and argues that the Institute now effectively seeks a\n\nbroad “sweeping [advisory] decision” on the definition of a “record” as used in the Department’s\n\nGuidance predicated on “new and wholly unsupported allegations regarding the [Department’s]\n\nrecordkeeping practices,” id. at 2; see also id. (“These allegations were not contained in the\n\nComplaint—let alone alleged with particularly, as required for a FOIA [policy-or-]practice\n\nclaim.”).\n\n       On March 24, 2017, “to resolve any dispute or ambiguity about whether [the] Institute[]\n\n. . . has [ ] properly pled [an explicit policy-or-practice claim], [the] Institute move[d] the Court\n\nfor leave to allow it to amend its complaint.” Pl.’s Mot. at 3. The Department opposed the\n\nInstitute’s motion, arguing that the Institute “seeks to change, at this final stage of the\n\nproceedings, the fundamental nature and scope of the action.” Def.’s Opp’n at 1.\n\n                               II.     STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\nA.     Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Pleading\n\n       Under Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a “court may, on just terms,\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fpermit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event\n\nthat happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d). 4 Rule\n\n15(d) aims “to make pleadings a means to achieve an orderly and fair administration of justice.”\n\nGomez v. Wilson, 477 F.2d 411, 417 n.34 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (quoting Griffin v. Cty. Sch. Bd., 377\n\nU.S. 218, 227 (1964)). Therefore, although the decision to grant a motion for leave to file a\n\nsupplemental pleading is “within the discretion of the district court,” Xingru Lin v. District of\n\nColumbia, 319 F.R.D. 1, 1 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Wildearth Guardians v. Kempthorne, 592 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 18, 23 (D.D.C. 2008)), such motions should be “freely granted when doing so will\n\npromote the economic and speedy disposition of the entire controversy between the parties, will\n\nnot cause undue delay or trial inconvenience, and will not prejudice the rights of any of the other\n\nparties to the action,” Hall v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 437 F.3d 94, 101 (D.C. Cir. 2006)\n\n(quoting 6A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, et al., Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 1504 (2d ed. 1990)).\n\nB.       Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n         The Court must grant a motion for summary judgment “if the movant shows that there is\n\nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court must\n\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Holcomb v. Powell, 433\n\n4\n  The parties disagree as to which provision of Rule 15 governs the Institute’s motion to amend its complaint.\nCompare Pl.’s Mot. at 3 (asserting that Rule 15(a)(2)’s as “justice so requires” is the applicable legal standard), with\nDef.’s Opp’n at 2 (contending that the “less-permissive Rule 15(d)” is the relevant legal standard). Because the\nInstitute seeks to plead additional allegations giving rise to a new cause of action challenging a Department policy\nthat was issued two months after the Institute initiated this action, see Pl.’s Mot. to Amend, Ex. 2 (Proposed\nAmended Complaint) ¶¶ 49–55, the Court construes the Institute’s motion as a request to file a supplemental\npleading, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) (governing “supplemental pleading[s] setting out any transaction, occurrence, or\nevent that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented”). In any event, the difference between\nmotions filed under Rule 15(a) and those filed pursuant to Rule 15(d) is a matter of semantics, see United States v.\nHicks, 283 F.3d 380, 385 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (noting that the “distinction [between motions filed pursuant to the two\nRules] is in most instances of little moment”), as “[m]otions to amend under Rule 15(a) and motions to supplement\nunder Rule 15(d) are subject to the same standard,” Xingru Lin v. District of Columbia, 319 F.R.D. 1, 1 (D.D.C.\n2016) (alteration in original) (quoting Wildearth Guardians v. Kempthorne, 592 F. Supp. 2d 18, 23 (D.D.C. 2008)).\n\n                                                           5\n\fF.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The Court must therefore draw “all justifiable inferences” in the\n\nnon-moving party’s favor and accept the non-moving party’s evidence as true. Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). The non-moving party, however, cannot rely on\n\n“mere allegations or denials.” Burke v. Gould, 286 F.3d 513, 517 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248). Thus, “[c]onclusory allegations unsupported by factual data will not\n\ncreate a triable issue of fact.” Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. Food & Drug Admin., 185\n\nF.3d 898, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (alteration in original) (quoting Exxon Corp. v. Fed. Trade\n\nComm’n, 663 F.2d 120, 126–27 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). If the Court concludes that “the nonmoving\n\nparty has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of [its] case with respect to\n\nwhich [it] has the burden of proof,” then the moving party is entitled to summary judgment.\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). However, at bottom, “in ruling on\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment, the [C]ourt shall grant summary judgment only if one of\n\nthe moving parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law upon material facts that are not\n\ngenuinely disputed.” Shays v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 424 F. Supp. 2d 100, 109 (D.D.C. 2006).\n\n       FOIA cases “typically are resolved on a motion for summary judgment.” Ortiz v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice, 67 F. Supp. 3d 109, 116 (D.D.C. 2014); see also Defs. of Wildlife v. U.S.\n\nBorder Patrol, 623 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2009). “[The] FOIA requires federal agencies to\n\ndisclose, upon request, broad classes of agency records unless the records are covered by the\n\nstatute’s exemptions.” Students Against Genocide v. Dep’t of State, 257 F.3d 828, 833 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2001). In a FOIA action, the defendant agency has the “burden of demonstrating that the\n\nwithheld documents [requested] are exempt from disclosure.” Boyd v. Criminal Div. of U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice, 475 F.3d 381, 385 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The Court will grant summary judgment to\n\nthe government in a FOIA case only if the agency can prove “that it has fully discharged its\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fobligations under the FOIA, after the underlying facts and the inferences to be drawn from them\n\nare construed in the light most favorable to the FOIA requester.” Friends of Blackwater v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Interior, 391 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 (D.D.C. 2005) (quoting Greenberg v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nTreasury, 10 F. Supp. 2d 3, 11 (D.D.C. 1998)). Thus, in a lawsuit brought to compel the\n\nproduction of documents under the FOIA, “an agency is entitled to summary judgment if no\n\nmaterial facts are in dispute and if it demonstrates ‘that each document that falls within the class\n\nrequested either has been produced . . . or is wholly[, or partially,] exempt [from disclosure].’”\n\nStudents Against Genocide, 257 F.3d at 833 (quoting Goland v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 607\n\nF.2d 339, 352 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).\n\n                                        III.    ANALYSIS\n\n   A. The Institute’s Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Complaint\n\n       The Institute contends that in order “to accommodate the [Department’s] position that\n\nany claim implicating its FOIA policy must be expressly pleaded in the Complaint and to remove\n\nany doubt that the Court may address all issues in this dispute,” Pl.’s Reply at 2, it should be\n\npermitted to supplement its Complaint to “add an explicit policy-or-practice claim based on the\n\n[Department’s] recently formalized and published . . . [G]uidance,” Pl.’s Mot. at 6. “[A]\n\nsupplemental pleading may include a new ‘cause of action’ when it would be convenient to\n\nlitigate all the claims between the parties in the same action.” Wright & Miller, Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure § 1506 (3d ed. 2017) (footnote omitted). However, a supplemental pleading may\n\nassert a “cause[] of action not alleged in the original complaint so long as [its] introduction does\n\nnot create surprise or prejudice the rights of the adverse party.” Aftergood v. Cent. Intelligence\n\nAgency, 225 F. Supp. 2d 27, 30 (D.D.C. 2002). The Department argues that the Institute’s\n\nmotion to supplement its Complaint to assert a new cause of action “constitutes undue surprise\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fand prejudices [its] interest in resolving the present . . . [FOIA] records-denial case.” Def.’s\n\nOpp’n at 1. The Court will address in turn the Department’s arguments regarding undue surprise\n\nand prejudice.\n\n       1. The Department’s Undue Surprise Argument\n\n       The Department argues that the Institute’s “attempt to drastically change the subject\n\nmatter and nature of this case amounts to undue surprise” because the Institute’s “proposed new\n\nclaim would transform th[is] case into a wide-ranging pattern-and-practice claim that could\n\naffect the [Department’s] response to virtually every FOIA request it receives.” Id. at 3; see also\n\nid. (asserting that “[t]he original claim in this case was a garden-variety FOIA suit seeking access\n\nto a single chain of emails”). The Court disagrees.\n\n       The Court acknowledges that what constitutes undue surprise for purposes of resolving\n\nmotions for leave to file a supplemental complaint alleging a new cause of action has not been\n\nspecifically defined in this Circuit. But, courts in this jurisdiction have granted such motions\n\nwhere defendants could not demonstrate surprise because they were aware of the issue or\n\nallegations sought to be added. See Bloche v. Dep’t of Def., et. al, No. 07-2050 (HHK/JMF),\n\n2009 WL 1330388, at *2 (D.D.C. May 13, 2009) (concluding that “supplementation of the\n\ncomplaint would not create any undue surprise for [the] defendants,” presumably because the\n\ndefendants were aware of the facts sought to be added to the plaintiffs’ complaint when the\n\nrequest to supplement was made (i.e., that the defendants had yet to respond to their FOIA\n\nrequest when supplementation was requested)); see also Aftergood, 225 F. Supp. 2d at 31\n\n(finding that the defendant “[wa]s already familiar with the” plaintiff’s newly asserted claims in\n\nhis second FOIA request, because that FOIA request was “substantially identical” to the\n\nplaintiff’s first FOIA request, and therefore, the defendant was not surprised by the claim). Here,\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fas the Institute correctly notes, the Department “cannot credibly claim unfair surprise,” as the\n\nDepartment, in its opposition to the Institute’s cross-motion, “characterized [the] Institute’s\n\nresponse to its mootness arguments as implicating a policy-or-practice claim,” demonstrating a\n\n“recognition and awareness of a [potential] policy-or-practice claim” prior to the Institute’s\n\nefforts to supplement its Complaint to include this claim. Pl.’s Reply at 5. Accordingly, the\n\nCourt is not convinced that the Department is unduly surprised by the new claim.\n\n       2. The Department’s Undue Prejudice Argument\n\n       The Department contends that granting the Institute’s motion would cause it undue\n\nprejudice “because the supplemental claim would force the parties back to the beginning of\n\nlitigation and through another round of dispositive motion briefing—all in a case where [the\n\nInstitute] ha[s] conceded that [the Department’s] bases for [its] withholding were proper.” Def.’s\n\nOpp’n at 3; see also id. (“Courts in this district have held that where resolution of the original\n\nclaim is close at hand, a new supplemental claim that would delay final resolution of the case\n\nconstitutes prejudice to the defendant.”). Additionally, the Department argues that the Institute\n\nunduly delayed seeking to supplement its complaint, as the Institute “knew about the\n\n[Department’s] [G]uidance before filing its [cross-]motion for summary judgment, and in fact it\n\ncites the . . . [G]uidance in that motion.” Id.\n\n       “Delay and prejudice are precisely the matters to be addressed in considering whether to\n\ngrant motions for supplemental pleadings.” Hall, 437 F.3d at 101. “To demonstrate ‘prejudice\n\nsufficient to justify a denial of leave to [supplement,] the opposing party must show that it was\n\nunfairly disadvantaged or deprived of the opportunity to present facts or evidence which it would\n\nhave offered had the [supplement] been timely.’” Butler v. White, 67 F. Supp. 3d 59, 67–68\n\n(D.D.C. 2014) (quoting In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 217 F.R.D. 30, 32 (D.D.C. 2003)). The\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fprejudice alleged “must in fact be ‘undue,’” Dove v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 221\n\nF.R.D. 246, 248 (D.D.C. 2004) (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)), which is\n\nmore than “mere harm to the non-movant,” id.; see also id. (“Examples of such prejudice include\n\nsituations where the opposed [supplement] will alter either the choice of counsel or the nature of\n\nthe opposing party’s strategy.”). In determining whether “the threat of prejudice to the opposing\n\nparty is ‘undue,’ courts should consider ‘the hardship to the moving party if leave to\n\n[supplement] is denied.’” United States v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc., 318 F.R.D. 202, 206 (D.D.C.\n\n2016) (citation omitted). Here, the Court finds that permitting the Institute to supplement its\n\nComplaint at this stage of the litigation would unduly prejudice the Department.\n\n       As support for its position that it did not unduly delay its request to supplement its\n\nComplaint to add a policy-or-practice claim against the Department, the Institute explains that\n\nthe Department’s Guidance, which it now seeks to challenge, “was published only a week before\n\nthe [Department] filed its summary judgment motion and reproduced the [Bringer-Wolfinger\n\nemail chain] without the offending segmentation.” Pl.’s Reply at 5 (noting that “[a]t the first\n\nopportunity . . . [it] argued in its cross-motion for summary judgment that the [Department’s\n\nG]uidance . . . and its FOIA policy defeat the [Department’s] claim that the case is moot”).\n\nHowever, as the Institute acknowledges, it “sought leave to [supplement] its Complaint only\n\nafter the [Department’s legal arguments as to why this case is now moot] bec[a]me fully\n\napparent in [the Department’s] opposition to [the Institute’s] cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment.” Id. Consequently, despite the Institute’s claim as to when it understood the\n\nDepartment’s position, its motion to supplement the Complaint “appears to be nothing more than\n\nan effort to avoid an adverse summary judgment ruling,” Local 472 v. Ga. Power Co., 684 F.2d\n\n721, 724–25 (11th Cir. 1982), and such legal maneuvering has been rejected by other members\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fof this Court, see, e.g., Hoffmann v. United States, 266 F. Supp. 2d 27, 34 (D.D.C. 2003) (“[I]t is\n\nfairly well established that ‘[d]enying leave to [supplement] is particularly appropriate when a\n\nlawsuit is on the verge of final resolution.’ A plaintiff, quite simply, cannot be permitted to\n\n‘circumvent the effects of summary judgment by [supplementing] the complaint every time a\n\ntermination of the action threatens.’” (second alteration in original) (citations omitted)).\n\n       Furthermore, granting the Institute’s motion to supplement “would permit [the Institute]\n\nto transform [its] case into something entirely new.” Miss. Ass’n of Coops. v. Farmers Home\n\nAdmin., 139 F.R.D. 542, 544 (D.D.C. 1991). Generally,\n\n       in FOIA cases, leave to [supplement] has been granted so that further requests for\n       documents could be added. Where, however, the complaint, [if supplemented as\n       proposed], would radically alter the scope and nature of the case and bears no\n       more than a tangential relationship to the original action, leave to [supplement]\n       should be denied.\n\nId. (citations omitted) (noting that the Supreme Court’s concern in Foman “was that leave to\n\n[supplement] should be granted liberally in order to ensure that litigants have their day in court,”\n\nbut was not intended to provide litigants a tool to preclude “the sun [from] set[ting] on their[] or\n\nany case”). The Institute asserts that “the proposed policy-or-practice claim relates to the same\n\nFOIA request presented in the original Complaint, concerns the [Department’s] conduct with\n\nregard to that same FOIA request, and would allow the Court to reach the merits of the parties’\n\ndispute.” Pl.’s Reply at 3. While it may be true that the Institute’s proposed policy-or-practice\n\nclaim relates to the same FOIA request, it does so only tangentially, as the Institute’s Complaint\n\nis entirely predicated on the improper withholding of responsive records through the designation\n\nof those records as “non-responsive.” See generally Compl. (focusing on the Department’s\n\nredactions of information in the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain). In fact, the Institute, in its\n\nComplaint, alleges only that the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain “constitute[d] a single record,”\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fid. ¶ 29, and that the Division “improperly segmented the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain into\n\nnine distinct ‘records,’” id. ¶ 30 (asserting that the Department “improperly applied a\n\n‘non-responsive’ designation” to segment and withhold portions of the Bringer-Wolfinger email\n\nchain). However, the Institute never asserted that the Department’s action was pursuant to an\n\nimproper policy or practice that violates the FOIA, see generally id. (failing to assert any\n\nallegations regarding the Department’s record keeping practices or FOIA policy concerning what\n\nconstitutes a “record” under the FOIA). And, as the Court already noted, the Division ultimately\n\nre-produced the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain “as a single record,” and withdrew all of the\n\n“non-responsive” redactions. Pl.’s Facts ¶ 11; see also Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 9–11. Thus, permitting\n\nthe Institute to supplement its Complaint at this time to allege a new cause of action would\n\n“fundamentally reshape the landscape of [this] litigation,” Bode & Grenier, LLP v. Knight, 808\n\nF.3d 852, 860 (D.C. Cir. 2015), and result in more than “the garden-variety prejudice that attends\n\na party sharpening the allegations of the complaint,” Honeywell Int’l, Inc., 318 F.R.D. at 207.\n\n        By contrast, the prejudice the Institute may suffer from a denial of its motion for leave to\n\nsupplement its Complaint does not outweigh the prejudice the Department will incur if the Court\n\ngrants the Institute’s motion. The Institute asserts that, if the Court denies leave to file its\n\nsupplement, “it w[ill] have to wait until a future, as-of-yet unfiled and unidentified request is ripe\n\nfor judicial review to challenge [the Department’s] actions, and then only if the [Department]\n\nacts in the same manner as it did here (i.e., improperly segmenting a responsive record into\n\nmultiple records).” Pl.’s Reply at 4; see also id. (“[T]he [Department] is now aware that [the]\n\nInstitute is attempting to challenge the agency’s unlawful FOIA policy, [and the Department]\n\nmay attempt to respond to any future . . . Institute [FOIA] request in such a way as to prevent\n\njudicial review while also implementing its unlawful FOIA policy against other requesters.”).\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fDespite the inconvenience the Institute argues it will experience from not being able to assert its\n\nwholly new cause of action against the Department in this litigation, this is not the type of\n\ninconvenience that implicates the principles of fairness and judicial economy that justify\n\napplication of the standard that leave to file a supplemental pleading should “be liberally\n\ngranted.” See Abdullah v. Washington, 530 F. Supp. 2d 112, 115 (D.D.C. 2008). This form of\n\ninconvenience is not something uncommon to federal litigation, as federal courts are limited to\n\nconsidering matters that present a currently existing case or controversy. U.S. Const. art. III § 2;\n\nsee also Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 90–91 (2013) (“We have repeatedly held that\n\nan ‘actual controversy’ must exist not only ‘at the time the complaint is filed,’ but through ‘all\n\nstages’ of the litigation.” (citations omitted)). This is because without a live case or controversy,\n\nfederal courts would essentially be tasked with rending advisory opinions, which they are\n\nprohibited from doing. See Public Serv. Elec. & Gas Co. v. FERC, 783 F.3d 1270, 1274 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2015) (“The oldest and most consistent thread in the federal law of justiciability is that the\n\nfederal courts will not give advisory opinions. To satisfy the firmly established Article III case\n\nor controversy requirement, there must be a live controversy at the time we review the case.”\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). In any event, the Institute remains “free to\n\nraise [its policy-or-practice] claim[] in separate litigation,” if and when circumstances warrant\n\nsuch action. City of Jersey City v. Consol. Rail Corp., 968 F. Supp. 2d 302, 307 (D.D.C. 2013).\n\n       In sum, the Court finds that granting the Institute leave to supplement its Complaint\n\nwould unduly prejudice the Department by expanding this litigation from a simple FOIA claim\n\nfor the production of responsive documents into a more complex case with an additional\n\npolicy-or-practice FOIA claim, particularly when this litigation is on the verge of final\n\nresolution. Accordingly, the Court must deny the Institute’s motion for leave to supplement its\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fComplaint.\n\n    B. The Parties’ Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n         As previously noted, the parties do not dispute the Division’s withholding of the\n\nBringer-Wolfinger email chain based on FOIA exemptions 3, 5, 6, 7(A), and 7(C). See Pl.’s\n\nSumm. J. Mot. at 8 (noting that it “does not oppose the [Department’s] Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment as to its application of exemptions and redactions in the January 18, 2017 production”\n\nof the reprocessed email chain). 5 However, the parties dispute whether the Institute’s claim is\n\nnow moot. See Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 9–18; Def.’s Reply at 2–6.\n\n         The Department contends that this case is now moot given that it has released to the\n\nInstitute all of the records that the Institute sought through its FOIA request. See Def.’s Reply at\n\n2 (“Because [the Institute] sought disclosure of specific materials, and obtained those materials,\n\nthe case is moot.”). “Article III’s limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to cases and\n\ncontroversies requires that ‘an actual controversy . . . be extant at all stages of review, not merely\n\nat the time the complaint is filed.’” Bayala v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Office of Gen.\n\nCounsel, 827 F.3d 31, 34 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (alteration in original) (quoting Genesis Healthcare\n\nCorp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 71 (2013)). Thus, “[i]f an intervening circumstance deprives the\n\nplaintiff of a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit, at any point during litigation, the\n\naction can no longer proceed and must be dismissed as moot.” Id. (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Genesis Healthcare Corp., 569 U.S. at 72). The party seeking dismissal has the burden\n\nof establishing mootness, and its burden is a “heavy” one. Honeywell Int’l, Inc. v. Nuclear\n\nRegulatory Comm’n, 628 F.3d 568, 576 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n\n\n\n5\n The parties also do not dispute the adequacy of the Division’s search for the requested records or the segregability\nof the reproduced Bringer-Wolfinger email chain. See generally Def.’s Mot.; Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot.\n\n\n                                                         14\n\f       Applying this standard to FOIA claims, “once all the documents are released to the\n\nrequesting party, there no longer is a case or controversy.” Bayala, 827 F.3d at 34; see also Perry\n\nv. Block, 684 F.2d 121, 125 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“[H]owever fitful or delayed the release of\n\ninformation under the FOIA may be, once all requested records are surrendered, federal courts\n\nhave no further statutory function to perform.”). This is so “[b]ecause the [FOIA] only\n\nauthorizes a court ‘to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the\n\nproduction of any agency records improperly withheld.’” Harvey v. Lynch, 123 F. Supp. 3d 3, 7\n\n(D.D.C. 2015) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)). Therefore, “[o]nce the records are produced\n\nthe substance of the controversy disappears and becomes moot since the disclosure which the\n\nsuit seeks has already been made.” Perry, 684 F.2d at 125 (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nCrooker v. U.S. State Dep’t, 628 F.2d 9, 10 (D.C. Cir. 1980)).\n\n       Here, the Institute concedes that the Department has produced all the records it sought\n\nand in the format it requested (i.e., without the offending redactions or segmentation based on\n\nthose redactions). See Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 8. More importantly, the Institute does not object\n\nto the redactions and withholdings made by the Department pursuant to various FOIA\n\nexemptions. See id. Consequently, “there is nothing of the underlying FOIA dispute left for the\n\nCourt to adjudicate.” Harvey, 123 F. Supp. 3d at 7.\n\n       Despite the Institute’s concession that is has now received from the Department all of the\n\ndocuments it requested and is entitled to receive under the FOIA, the Institute argues that this\n\ncase is not moot because two exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply. See Pl.’s Summ. J.\n\nMot. at 9. Specifically, the Institute argues that the “voluntary cessation of the challenged\n\nbehavior” and the “repetition yet evading review” exceptions permit this Court to retain\n\njurisdiction of this case. See id. However, the Institute’s reliance on these two exceptions is to\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fno avail.\n\n        Under the voluntary cessation doctrine, “[a] case will not be moot . . . where a defendant\n\nhas voluntarily stopped the [challenged behavior], but may ‘return to [its] old ways.’” Citizens\n\nfor Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Sec. Exch. Comm’n, 858 F. Supp. 2d 51, 61\n\n(D.D.C. 2012) (third alteration in original) (quoting United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S.\n\n629, 632 (1953)). And, “[a] party’s voluntary cessation will be found to moot a case where: ‘(1)\n\nthere is no reasonable expectation . . . that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief\n\nor events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.’” Id.\n\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Larsen v. U.S. Navy, 525 F.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2008)).\n\nThe Institute asserts that in this case, “although the [Department] is no longer attempting to\n\nsegment the email chain into multiple records as a basis for redacting information, [the\n\nDepartment] does not explicitly concede that the email chain is one record.” Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot.\n\nat 11 (citations omitted). Therefore, according to the Institute, “[a]bsent a court decision that the\n\n[Department’s] use of ‘non-responsive’ redactions and treatment of one record as many records\n\nis improper, the ‘dispute over the legality of the challenged practices’ and the ‘public interest in\n\nhaving the legality of the practices settled’ will remain unresolved.” Id. (quoting W.T. Grant\n\nCo., 345 U.S. at 632). In addition, the Institute contends that the “Court should not presume that\n\nthe [Department] will refrain from returning to its old ways” because the Department’s\n\nGuidance, issued this year, “if implemented as written, will ensure the continuation of the same\n\noffending behavior challenged in this litigation.” Id. at 12.\n\n        The Court finds that the Institute’s position that the Department’s voluntary cessation of\n\nits challenged conduct does not moot this case is fundamentally flawed. Primarily, as the\n\nDepartment correctly notes, the Institute has not pleaded in its Complaint allegations of “any\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fpattern or practice by the [Department] with respect to FOIA responses.” Def.’s Reply at 4.\n\nRather, the Institute sought only the disclosure of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain. See\n\nCompl. at 7; see also Cause of Action Inst. v. Eggleston, 224 F. Supp. 3d 63, 71 (D.D.C. 2016)\n\n(“To state a claim for relief under the ‘policy or practice’ doctrine articulated in Payne[ Enters.,\n\nInc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486 (D.C. Cir. 1988)] . . . a plaintiff must allege, inter alia, facts\n\nestablishing that the agency has adopted, endorsed, or implemented some policy or practice that\n\nconstitutes an ongoing ‘failure to abide by the terms of the FOIA.’” (quoting Muttitt v. Dep’t of\n\nState, 926 F. Supp. 2d 284, 293 (D.D.C. 2013))). Furthermore, each of the cases the Institute\n\ncites to demonstrate the applicability of the voluntary cessation of the challenged behavior\n\ndoctrine all involved plaintiffs who expressly challenged an agency policy or practice as a cause\n\nof action pleaded in their complaints. See Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 10–13 (citing cases where\n\ncourts did not find the plaintiffs’ claims moot after the production of the requested documents\n\nbecause they also explicitly challenged the agency’s FOIA policy or practice). Therefore,\n\nbecause the Institute has not challenged a Department’s FOIA policy or practice in regards to\n\nsegmenting e-mail chains into multiple records in its Complaint, the Court is not convinced that\n\nthe voluntary cessation of the challenged behavior exception applies in this case.\n\n        Regarding the capable of repetition yet evading review exception, a case is “not moot if\n\n‘(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or\n\nexpiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be\n\nsubjected to the same action again.’” Ctr. for Study of Servs. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\n\nServs., 130 F. Supp. 3d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2015) (alterations in original) (quoting McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v. Nat’l Aeronautics & Space Admin., 102 F. Supp. 2d 21, 23 (D.D.C. 2000)). The\n\nInstitute argues that both of these requirements are satisfied in this case because it “has not been\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\fafforded an opportunity to fully litigate its claim,” Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 15, and “because [it] is\n\na frequent FOIA requester and litigator, has more than twenty FOIA requests currently pending\n\nat the [Department], and the [Department] has not recanted the disputed legal position but\n\ninstead has issued [the G]uidance reaffirming its position that the challenged behavior is\n\nacceptable,” id. at 16.\n\n         The Court finds that the capable of repetition yet evading review exception does not\n\nprovide support for the Institute’s position for several reasons. Primarily, as the parties\n\nacknowledge, it is unclear whether the capable of repetition yet evading review doctrine applies\n\nto FOIA disclosures, given the general duration of the proceedings involved in such litigation.\n\nSee Def.’s Reply at 5 (arguing that “[t]he ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review’ doctrine\n\ndoes not apply to FOIA disclosures” (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp., 102 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n23)); Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 15 (arguing that McDonnell Douglas Corp. is distinguishable from\n\nthe facts in this case). 6 But, even if this exception was applicable, the Institute’s claim in this\n\ncase, as previously noted, was the improper withholding of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain,\n\nnot a challenge to any of the Department’s established FOIA policies or practices. See generally\n\nCompl. Considering that the Department has now disclosed the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain\n\nto the Institute’s satisfaction, it cannot conceivably be said that this challenged action was “too\n\nshort to be fully litigated,” Ctr. for Study of Servs., 130 F. Supp. 3d at 8, as the Institute made its\n\nFOIA request well over a year ago, see Compl. ¶ 6, or that the Department is capable of\n\nrepeating the same harm (i.e., improperly withholding the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain). And,\n\n6\n  In holding that this mootness exception does not apply to FOIA disclosures, the McDonnell Douglas court relied\non Gulf Oil Corp. v. Brock, 778 F.2d 834, 839 (D.C. Cir. 1985). See 102 F. Supp. 2d at 23. However, in Gulf Oil\nCorp, the Circuit stated that “[t]he prolonged proceedings of this case are testimony that the first requirement under\nthe ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review’ exception is not met with regard to FOIA disclosures.” 778 F.2d at\n839 (noting in that reverse FOIA action, that eleven years had elapsed between when an organization made a request\nfrom the United States Department of Labor for disclosure of the plaintiff’s 1973 affirmative action plan and when\nthat organization withdrew its request, and that the plaintiff’s 1973 affirmative action plan had not in fact yet been\ndisclosed).\n\n                                                         18\n\fthe purported policy or practice which the Institute now desires to challenge (i.e., the\n\nDepartment’s Guidance) “is [not] likely to evade review,” as the Institute remains free to\n\nchallenge the Department’s Guidance in subsequent litigation if there is a factual basis to\n\nchallenge the Guidance and the challenge is properly pleaded.\n\n         In sum, the Institute concedes that it has received the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain in\n\nthe format requested, the disclosure of which was the subject of its FOIA request and the\n\nunderlying basis for its Complaint, and it does not oppose the redactions the Division applied to\n\nthe Bringer-Wolfinger email chain pursuant to several FOIA exemptions. See generally Pl.’s\n\nSumm. J. Mot. Consequently, because the Institute has obtained the relief that it sought, the\n\nInstitute’s case is now moot. See Hall, 437 F.3d at 99. Accordingly, the Court must grant the\n\nDepartment’s motion for summary judgment and deny the Institute’s cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment. 7\n\n                                             IV.      CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that it must grant the Department’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, deny the Institute’s cross-motion for summary judgment, and\n\ndeny the Institute’s motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint. 8\n\n\n7\n The Institute also asserts that, because this case is not moot, it is entitled to summary judgment and a finding by the\nCourt “that the [Department] violated the FOIA by redacting information as non-responsive and improperly\nsegmenting one record into multiple records.” Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 18; see generally Pl.’s Summ. J. Reply.\nHaving concluded that this case is moot, the Court need not address this argument by the Institute, as “[t]he rule\nagainst deciding moot cases forbids federal courts from rendering advisory opinions or ‘decid[ing] questions that\ncannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.’” Hall, 437 F.3d at 99 (alteration in original) (citation\nomitted).\n8\n In its cross-motion, the Institute states that “upon completion of summary judgment proceedings, [it] intends to\nmove for attorney[s’] fees and costs.” Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 9. The Court notes that this memorandum opinion\ndoes not determine whether the Institute was a prevailing party for purposes of determining whether the Institute is\neligible for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. Additionally, the Court’s conclusion that this case is moot does\nnot prevent the Institute from filing a motion seeking attorneys’ fees and costs. See Harvey, 123 F. Supp. 3d at 8–9\n(holding that, even though the plaintiff’s case was moot, the plaintiff may still seek reasonable attorneys’ fees and\ncosts for bringing the action to the extent he is a prevailing party).\n\n\n                                                          19\n\f           SO ORDERED this 10th day of October, 2017. 9\n\n\n                                                                     REGGIE B.

BACKGROUND\n\n         On July 15, 2016, the Institute sent a FOIA request by letter to the Department’s Tax\n\nDivision (the “Division”), “seeking production of two specific records relating to the detailing of\n\n[Department] attorneys to the White House.” Compl. ¶ 6. First, the Institute sought “an email\n\nchain involving two government employees (the ‘Bringer-Wolfinger email chain’) . . . [that was\n\nsubmitted in] May 2014.” Id. ¶ 9. Second, the Institute sought “a November 2011 report entitled\n\nthe Current Practices for Attorney Assignments, Transfers, and Details” to the White House.\n\nPl.’s Facts ¶ 4; Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 3–4. The Division had previously produced these two specific\n\nrecords “in response to another . . . FOIA request” made by the Institute. Pl.’s Facts ¶ 2.\n\nHowever, the Division “had withheld large portions of those records by applying ‘NR’ or\n\n‘Non-Responsive’ labels to the redactions.” Id.; see also Compl. ¶ 7. Thus, in its July 15, 2016\n\nFOIA request, the Institute sought the two requested records in their entirety, without any\n\nnon-responsive redactions. See Compl. ¶ 8.\n\n         “By letter [] dated August 9, 2016, [the Division] acknowledged receipt of the\n\n[Institute’s] July 15, 2016 FOIA request . . . and requested a conference to clarify the scope of\n\nthe request.” Id. ¶ 11. On August 15, 2016, the parties “held a [tele]phone conference,” during\n\nwhich the Institute explained that the use of “non-responsive” as a label to redact information\n\nwas an improper “withholding tool” and clarified that it sought only the two records in their\n\nentirety. Id. ¶ 12; see also Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 2–6. On September 20, 2016, the Division issued its\n\nfinal decision regarding the Institute’s July 15, 2016 FOIA request as clarified, producing in its\n\nentirety the November 2011 report, without any redactions. See Def.’s Facts ¶ 7; Pl.’s Facts ¶ 7. 2\n\n\n2\n  The Institute does not challenge the Department’s “processing of this record,” and this “record is not part of the\ninstant litigation.” Pl.’s Facts ¶ 7.\n\n                                                           2\n\fHowever, the Division subdivided the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain into nine separate records\n\nand redacted “Record 7” on the basis of Exemptions 3 and 5 of the FOIA and the remaining\n\nrecords as non-responsive. Pl.’s Facts ¶ 8; Compl. ¶ 17.\n\n         The Institute initiated this action by filing its Complaint on November 8, 2016, see\n\nCompl. at 1, alleging that the Department “improperly segmented the Bringer-Wolfinger email\n\nchain into nine distinct ‘records’ and improperly applied a ‘non-responsive’ designation to\n\nwithhold eight of those ‘records,’” id. ¶ 30. 3 Thereafter, on January 12, 2017, the Department\n\nupdated its policy regarding what constitutes a “record” under the FOIA, in which it urged\n\nagencies to “use the definition of [the term] record found in the Privacy Act,” meaning that “each\n\n‘item, collection, or grouping of information’ on the topic of the request can be considered a\n\ndistinct ‘record.’” Pl.’s Mot. to Amend, Exhibit (“Ex.”) J (OIP Guidance: Defining a “Record”\n\nUnder the FOIA (the “Guidance”)) at 3. Later, on January 18, 2017, the Division re-processed\n\nthe Bringer-Wolfinger email chain and re-produced the record to the Institute “as a single\n\nrecord,” withdrawing all of the “non-responsive” redactions, but “redact[ing] significant portions\n\nof responsive material” pursuant to FOIA exemptions 3, 5, 6, 7(A), and 7(C). Pl.’s Facts ¶ 11;\n\nsee also Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 9–11.\n\n         The Department now moves for summary judgment, asserting that its redactions of the\n\nre-processed and re-produced Bringer-Wolfinger email chain were proper, as those contents were\n\nexempt from disclosure under several FOIA exemptions. See Def.’s Mot. at 3. And, given that\n\nthe Department re-produced the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain as one record, and because the\n\nDepartment asserts that withholding portions of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain is proper\n\n3\n  Prior to filing this lawsuit, the Institute filed an administrative appeal with the Department’s Office of Information\nPolicy (the “Office”), challenging the Department’s withholdings of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain. See Pl.’s\nFacts ¶ 9. Although the Office acknowledged receipt of the Institute’s appeal, it never ruled on the appeal. See id.\n¶ 10.\n\n\n                                                           3\n\fpursuant to specific FOIA exemptions and not because they are “non-responsive,” the\n\nDepartment contends that the issue of “whether the email chain constitutes one record or several\n\nrecords” is now “moot.” Def.’s Mot. at 15. On February 8, 2017, the Institute simultaneously\n\nopposed the Department’s motion and cross-moved for summary judgment, see Pl.’s Summ. J.\n\nMot. at 1, arguing that “its claim against the [Department] for using ‘non-responsive’ as a\n\nredaction tool and improperly segmenting one record into multiple records is not moot,” id. at\n\n18. The Institute, however, did not oppose the Department’s motion “as to its application of\n\nexemptions and redactions in the January 18, 2017 production” of the re-processed\n\nBringer-Wolfinger email chain. Id. at 8. In response, the Department maintains its position that\n\nthis case is now moot, see Def.’s Reply at 1, and argues that the Institute now effectively seeks a\n\nbroad “sweeping [advisory] decision” on the definition of a “record” as used in the Department’s\n\nGuidance predicated on “new and wholly unsupported allegations regarding the [Department’s]\n\nrecordkeeping practices,” id. at 2; see also id. (“These allegations were not contained in the\n\nComplaint—let alone alleged with particularly, as required for a FOIA [policy-or-]practice\n\nclaim.”).\n\n       On March 24, 2017, “to resolve any dispute or ambiguity about whether [the] Institute[]\n\n. . . has [ ] properly pled [an explicit policy-or-practice claim], [the] Institute move[d] the Court\n\nfor leave to allow it to amend its complaint.” Pl.’s Mot. at 3. The Department opposed the\n\nInstitute’s motion, arguing that the Institute “seeks to change, at this final stage of the\n\nproceedings, the fundamental nature and scope of the action.” Def.’s Opp’n at 1.\n\n                               II.     STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\nA.     Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Pleading\n\n       Under Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a “court may, on just terms,\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fpermit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event\n\nthat happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.” Fed.

Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n         The Court must grant a motion for summary judgment “if the movant shows that there is\n\nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court must\n\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Holcomb v. Powell, 433\n\n4\n  The parties disagree as to which provision of Rule 15 governs the Institute’s motion to amend its complaint.\nCompare Pl.’s Mot. at 3 (asserting that Rule 15(a)(2)’s as “justice so requires” is the applicable legal standard), with\nDef.’s Opp’n at 2 (contending that the “less-permissive Rule 15(d)” is the relevant legal standard). Because the\nInstitute seeks to plead additional allegations giving rise to a new cause of action challenging a Department policy\nthat was issued two months after the Institute initiated this action, see Pl.’s Mot. to Amend, Ex. 2 (Proposed\nAmended Complaint) ¶¶ 49–55, the Court construes the Institute’s motion as a request to file a supplemental\npleading, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) (governing “supplemental pleading[s] setting out any transaction, occurrence, or\nevent that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented”). In any event, the difference between\nmotions filed under Rule 15(a) and those filed pursuant to Rule 15(d) is a matter of semantics, see United States v.\nHicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185620\"><a href=\"/opinion/185620/united-states-v-hicks-eric-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385 (D.C.

The Institute’s Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Complaint\n\n       The Institute contends that in order “to accommodate the [Department’s] position that\n\nany claim implicating its FOIA policy must be expressly pleaded in the Complaint and to remove\n\nany doubt that the Court may address all issues in this dispute,” Pl.’s Reply at 2, it should be\n\npermitted to supplement its Complaint to “add an explicit policy-or-practice claim based on the\n\n[Department’s] recently formalized and published . . . [G]uidance,” Pl.’s Mot. at 6. “[A]\n\nsupplemental pleading may include a new ‘cause of action’ when it would be convenient to\n\nlitigate all the claims between the parties in the same action.” Wright & Miller, Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure § 1506 (3d ed. 2017) (footnote omitted). However, a supplemental pleading may\n\nassert a “cause[] of action not alleged in the original complaint so long as [its] introduction does\n\nnot create surprise or prejudice the rights of the adverse party.” Aftergood v. Cent. Intelligence\n\nAgency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567069\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567069/aftergood-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (D.D.C. 2002). The Department argues that the Institute’s\n\nmotion to supplement its Complaint to assert a new cause of action “constitutes undue surprise\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fand prejudices [its] interest in resolving the present . . . [FOIA] records-denial case.” Def.’s\n\nOpp’n at 1. The Court will address in turn the Department’s arguments regarding undue surprise\n\nand prejudice.\n\n       1. The Department’s Undue Surprise Argument\n\n       The Department argues that the Institute’s “attempt to drastically change the subject\n\nmatter and nature of this case amounts to undue surprise” because the Institute’s “proposed new\n\nclaim would transform th[is] case into a wide-ranging pattern-and-practice claim that could\n\naffect the [Department’s] response to virtually every FOIA request it receives.” Id. at 3; see also\n\nid. (asserting that “[t]he original claim in this case was a garden-variety FOIA suit seeking access\n\nto a single chain of emails”). The Court disagrees.\n\n       The Court acknowledges that what constitutes undue surprise for purposes of resolving\n\nmotions for leave to file a supplemental complaint alleging a new cause of action has not been\n\nspecifically defined in this Circuit. But, courts in this jurisdiction have granted such motions\n\nwhere defendants could not demonstrate surprise because they were aware of the issue or\n\nallegations sought to be added. See Bloche v. Dep’t of Def., et. al, No. 07-2050 (HHK/JMF),\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1330388</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (D.D.C. May 13, 2009) (concluding that “supplementation of the\n\ncomplaint would not create any undue surprise for [the] defendants,” presumably because the\n\ndefendants were aware of the facts sought to be added to the plaintiffs’ complaint when the\n\nrequest to supplement was made (i.e., that the defendants had yet to respond to their FOIA\n\nrequest when supplementation was requested)); see also Aftergood, 225 F. Supp. 2d at 31\n\n(finding that the defendant “[wa]s already familiar with the” plaintiff’s newly asserted claims in\n\nhis second FOIA request, because that FOIA request was “substantially identical” to the\n\nplaintiff’s first FOIA request, and therefore, the defendant was not surprised by the claim).

Pl.’s Reply at 5. Accordingly, the\n\nCourt is not convinced that the Department is unduly surprised by the new claim.\n\n       2. The Department’s Undue Prejudice Argument\n\n       The Department contends that granting the Institute’s motion would cause it undue\n\nprejudice “because the supplemental claim would force the parties back to the beginning of\n\nlitigation and through another round of dispositive motion briefing—all in a case where [the\n\nInstitute] ha[s] conceded that [the Department’s] bases for [its] withholding were proper.” Def.’s\n\nOpp’n at 3; see also id. (“Courts in this district have held that where resolution of the original\n\nclaim is close at hand, a new supplemental claim that would delay final resolution of the case\n\nconstitutes prejudice to the defendant.”). Additionally, the Department argues that the Institute\n\nunduly delayed seeking to supplement its complaint, as the Institute “knew about the\n\n[Department’s] [G]uidance before filing its [cross-]motion for summary judgment, and in fact it\n\ncites the . . . [G]uidance in that motion.” Id.\n\n       “Delay and prejudice are precisely the matters to be addressed in considering whether to\n\ngrant motions for supplemental pleadings.” Hall, 437 F.3d at 101. “To demonstrate ‘prejudice\n\nsufficient to justify a denial of leave to [supplement,] the opposing party must show that it was\n\nunfairly disadvantaged or deprived of the opportunity to present facts or evidence which it would\n\nhave offered had the [supplement] been timely.’” Butler v.

Here, the Court finds that permitting the Institute to supplement its\n\nComplaint at this stage of the litigation would unduly prejudice the Department.\n\n       As support for its position that it did not unduly delay its request to supplement its\n\nComplaint to add a policy-or-practice claim against the Department, the Institute explains that\n\nthe Department’s Guidance, which it now seeks to challenge, “was published only a week before\n\nthe [Department] filed its summary judgment motion and reproduced the [Bringer-Wolfinger\n\nemail chain] without the offending segmentation.” Pl.’s Reply at 5 (noting that “[a]t the first\n\nopportunity . . . [it] argued in its cross-motion for summary judgment that the [Department’s\n\nG]uidance . . . and its FOIA policy defeat the [Department’s] claim that the case is moot”).\n\nHowever, as the Institute acknowledges, it “sought leave to [supplement] its Complaint only\n\nafter the [Department’s legal arguments as to why this case is now moot] bec[a]me fully\n\napparent in [the Department’s] opposition to [the Institute’s] cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment.” Id. Consequently, despite the Institute’s claim as to when it understood the\n\nDepartment’s position, its motion to supplement the Complaint “appears to be nothing more than\n\nan effort to avoid an adverse summary judgment ruling,” Local 472 v.

Generally,\n\n       in FOIA cases, leave to [supplement] has been granted so that further requests for\n       documents could be added. Where, however, the complaint, [if supplemented as\n       proposed], would radically alter the scope and nature of the case and bears no\n       more than a tangential relationship to the original action, leave to [supplement]\n       should be denied.\n\nId. (citations omitted) (noting that the Supreme Court’s concern in Foman “was that leave to\n\n[supplement] should be granted liberally in order to ensure that litigants have their day in court,”\n\nbut was not intended to provide litigants a tool to preclude “the sun [from] set[ting] on their[] or\n\nany case”). The Institute asserts that “the proposed policy-or-practice claim relates to the same\n\nFOIA request presented in the original Complaint, concerns the [Department’s] conduct with\n\nregard to that same FOIA request, and would allow the Court to reach the merits of the parties’\n\ndispute.” Pl.’s Reply at 3. While it may be true that the Institute’s proposed policy-or-practice\n\nclaim relates to the same FOIA request, it does so only tangentially, as the Institute’s Complaint\n\nis entirely predicated on the improper withholding of responsive records through the designation\n\nof those records as “non-responsive.” See generally Compl. (focusing on the Department’s\n\nredactions of information in the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain). In fact, the Institute, in its\n\nComplaint, alleges only that the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain “constitute[d] a single record,”\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fid. ¶ 29, and that the Division “improperly segmented the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain into\n\nnine distinct ‘records,’” id. ¶ 30 (asserting that the Department “improperly applied a\n\n‘non-responsive’ designation” to segment and withhold portions of the Bringer-Wolfinger email\n\nchain). However, the Institute never asserted that the Department’s action was pursuant to an\n\nimproper policy or practice that violates the FOIA, see generally id. (failing to assert any\n\nallegations regarding the Department’s record keeping practices or FOIA policy concerning what\n\nconstitutes a “record” under the FOIA). And, as the Court already noted, the Division ultimately\n\nre-produced the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain “as a single record,” and withdrew all of the\n\n“non-responsive” redactions. Pl.’s Facts ¶ 11; see also Def.’s Facts ¶¶ 9–11. Thus, permitting\n\nthe Institute to supplement its Complaint at this time to allege a new cause of action would\n\n“fundamentally reshape the landscape of [this] litigation,” Bode & Grenier, LLP v. Knight, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 860 (D.C.

The Institute asserts that, if the Court denies leave to file its\n\nsupplement, “it w[ill] have to wait until a future, as-of-yet unfiled and unidentified request is ripe\n\nfor judicial review to challenge [the Department’s] actions, and then only if the [Department]\n\nacts in the same manner as it did here (i.e., improperly segmenting a responsive record into\n\nmultiple records).” Pl.’s Reply at 4; see also id. (“[T]he [Department] is now aware that [the]\n\nInstitute is attempting to challenge the agency’s unlawful FOIA policy, [and the Department]\n\nmay attempt to respond to any future . . .

This form of\n\ninconvenience is not something uncommon to federal litigation, as federal courts are limited to\n\nconsidering matters that present a currently existing case or controversy.

This is because without a live case or controversy,\n\nfederal courts would essentially be tasked with rending advisory opinions, which they are\n\nprohibited from doing. See Public Serv.

To satisfy the firmly established Article III case\n\nor controversy requirement, there must be a live controversy at the time we review the case.”\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). In any event, the Institute remains “free to\n\nraise [its policy-or-practice] claim[] in separate litigation,” if and when circumstances warrant\n\nsuch action. City of Jersey City v. Consol.

Accordingly, the Court must deny the Institute’s motion for leave to supplement its\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fComplaint.\n\n    B. The Parties’ Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n         As previously noted, the parties do not dispute the Division’s withholding of the\n\nBringer-Wolfinger email chain based on FOIA exemptions 3, 5, 6, 7(A), and 7(C). See Pl.’s\n\nSumm. J. Mot. at 8 (noting that it “does not oppose the [Department’s] Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment as to its application of exemptions and redactions in the January 18, 2017 production”\n\nof the reprocessed email chain). 5 However, the parties dispute whether the Institute’s claim is\n\nnow moot. See Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 9–18; Def.’s Reply at 2–6.\n\n         The Department contends that this case is now moot given that it has released to the\n\nInstitute all of the records that the Institute sought through its FOIA request. See Def.’s Reply at\n\n2 (“Because [the Institute] sought disclosure of specific materials, and obtained those materials,\n\nthe case is moot.”). “Article III’s limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to cases and\n\ncontroversies requires that ‘an actual controversy . . . be extant at all stages of review, not merely\n\nat the time the complaint is filed.’” Bayala v.

See generally Def.’s Mot.; Pl.’s Summ. J.

See Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 8. More importantly, the Institute does not object\n\nto the redactions and withholdings made by the Department pursuant to various FOIA\n\nexemptions. See id. Consequently, “there is nothing of the underlying FOIA dispute left for the\n\nCourt to adjudicate.” Harvey, 123 F. Supp. 3d at 7.\n\n       Despite the Institute’s concession that is has now received from the Department all of the\n\ndocuments it requested and is entitled to receive under the FOIA, the Institute argues that this\n\ncase is not moot because two exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply. See Pl.’s Summ. J.\n\nMot. at 9. Specifically, the Institute argues that the “voluntary cessation of the challenged\n\nbehavior” and the “repetition yet evading review” exceptions permit this Court to retain\n\njurisdiction of this case. See id. However, the Institute’s reliance on these two exceptions is to\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fno avail.\n\n        Under the voluntary cessation doctrine, “[a] case will not be moot . . . where a defendant\n\nhas voluntarily stopped the [challenged behavior], but may ‘return to [its] old ways.’” Citizens\n\nfor Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v.

And, “[a] party’s voluntary cessation will be found to moot a case where: ‘(1)\n\nthere is no reasonable expectation . . . that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief\n\nor events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.’” Id.\n\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Larsen v.

J. Mot.\n\nat 11 (citations omitted). Therefore, according to the Institute, “[a]bsent a court decision that the\n\n[Department’s] use of ‘non-responsive’ redactions and treatment of one record as many records\n\nis improper, the ‘dispute over the legality of the challenged practices’ and the ‘public interest in\n\nhaving the legality of the practices settled’ will remain unresolved.” Id. (quoting W.T. Grant\n\nCo., 345 U.S. at 632). In addition, the Institute contends that the “Court should not presume that\n\nthe [Department] will refrain from returning to its old ways” because the Department’s\n\nGuidance, issued this year, “if implemented as written, will ensure the continuation of the same\n\noffending behavior challenged in this litigation.” Id. at 12.\n\n        The Court finds that the Institute’s position that the Department’s voluntary cessation of\n\nits challenged conduct does not moot this case is fundamentally flawed. Primarily, as the\n\nDepartment correctly notes, the Institute has not pleaded in its Complaint allegations of “any\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fpattern or practice by the [Department] with respect to FOIA responses.” Def.’s Reply at 4.\n\nRather, the Institute sought only the disclosure of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain.

Therefore,\n\nbecause the Institute has not challenged a Department’s FOIA policy or practice in regards to\n\nsegmenting e-mail chains into multiple records in its Complaint, the Court is not convinced that\n\nthe voluntary cessation of the challenged behavior exception applies in this case.\n\n        Regarding the capable of repetition yet evading review exception, a case is “not moot if\n\n‘(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or\n\nexpiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be\n\nsubjected to the same action again.’” Ctr. for Study of Servs. v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (D.D.C. 2000)). The\n\nInstitute argues that both of these requirements are satisfied in this case because it “has not been\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\fafforded an opportunity to fully litigate its claim,” Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 15, and “because [it] is\n\na frequent FOIA requester and litigator, has more than twenty FOIA requests currently pending\n\nat the [Department], and the [Department] has not recanted the disputed legal position but\n\ninstead has issued [the G]uidance reaffirming its position that the challenged behavior is\n\nacceptable,” id. at 16.\n\n         The Court finds that the capable of repetition yet evading review exception does not\n\nprovide support for the Institute’s position for several reasons. Primarily, as the parties\n\nacknowledge, it is unclear whether the capable of repetition yet evading review doctrine applies\n\nto FOIA disclosures, given the general duration of the proceedings involved in such litigation.\n\nSee Def.’s Reply at 5 (arguing that “[t]he ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review’ doctrine\n\ndoes not apply to FOIA disclosures” (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp., 102 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n23)); Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 15 (arguing that McDonnell Douglas Corp. is distinguishable from\n\nthe facts in this case). 6 But, even if this exception was applicable, the Institute’s claim in this\n\ncase, as previously noted, was the improper withholding of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain,\n\nnot a challenge to any of the Department’s established FOIA policies or practices. See generally\n\nCompl. Considering that the Department has now disclosed the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain\n\nto the Institute’s satisfaction, it cannot conceivably be said that this challenged action was “too\n\nshort to be fully litigated,” Ctr. for Study of Servs., 130 F. Supp. 3d at 8, as the Institute made its\n\nFOIA request well over a year ago, see Compl. ¶ 6, or that the Department is capable of\n\nrepeating the same harm (i.e., improperly withholding the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain). And,\n\n6\n  In holding that this mootness exception does not apply to FOIA disclosures, the McDonnell Douglas court relied\non Gulf Oil Corp. v. Brock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461568\"><a href=\"/opinion/461568/gulf-oil-corporation-v-william-brock-united-states-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">778</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839 (D.C. Cir. 1985). See 102 F. Supp. 2d at 23. However, in Gulf Oil\nCorp, the Circuit stated that “[t]he prolonged proceedings of this case are testimony that the first requirement under\nthe ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review’ exception is not met with regard to FOIA disclosures.” 778 F.2d at\n839 (noting in that reverse FOIA action, that eleven years had elapsed between when an organization made a request\nfrom the United States Department of Labor for disclosure of the plaintiff’s 1973 affirmative action plan and when\nthat organization withdrew its request, and that the plaintiff’s 1973 affirmative action plan had not in fact yet been\ndisclosed).\n\n                                                         18\n\fthe purported policy or practice which the Institute now desires to challenge (i.e., the\n\nDepartment’s Guidance) “is [not] likely to evade review,” as the Institute remains free to\n\nchallenge the Department’s Guidance in subsequent litigation if there is a factual basis to\n\nchallenge the Guidance and the challenge is properly pleaded.\n\n         In sum, the Institute concedes that it has received the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain in\n\nthe format requested, the disclosure of which was the subject of its FOIA request and the\n\nunderlying basis for its Complaint, and it does not oppose the redactions the Division applied to\n\nthe Bringer-Wolfinger email chain pursuant to several FOIA exemptions. See generally Pl.’s\n\nSumm. J. Mot. Consequently, because the Institute has obtained the relief that it sought, the\n\nInstitute’s case is now moot. See Hall, 437 F.3d at 99. Accordingly, the Court must grant the\n\nDepartment’s motion for summary judgment and deny the Institute’s cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment. 7\n\n                                             IV.      CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that it must grant the Department’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, deny the Institute’s cross-motion for summary judgment, and\n\ndeny the Institute’s motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint. 8\n\n\n7\n The Institute also asserts that, because this case is not moot, it is entitled to summary judgment and a finding by the\nCourt “that the [Department] violated the FOIA by redacting information as non-responsive and improperly\nsegmenting one record into multiple records.” Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 18; see generally Pl.’s Summ. J. Reply.\nHaving concluded that this case is moot, the Court need not address this argument by the Institute, as “[t]he rule\nagainst deciding moot cases forbids federal courts from rendering advisory opinions or ‘decid[ing] questions that\ncannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.’” Hall, 437 F.3d at 99 (alteration in original) (citation\nomitted).\n8\n In its cross-motion, the Institute states that “upon completion of summary judgment proceedings, [it] intends to\nmove for attorney[s’] fees and costs.” Pl.’s Summ. J. Mot. at 9. The Court notes that this memorandum opinion\ndoes not determine whether the Institute was a prevailing party for purposes of determining whether the Institute is\neligible for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. Additionally, the Court’s conclusion that this case is moot does\nnot prevent the Institute from filing a motion seeking attorneys’ fees and costs. See Harvey, 123 F. Supp. 3d at 8–9\n(holding that, even though the plaintiff’s case was moot, the plaintiff may still seek reasonable attorneys’ fees and\ncosts for bringing the action to the extent he is a prevailing party).\n\n\n                                                          19\n\f           SO ORDERED this 10th day of October, 2017. 9\n\n\n                                                                     REGGIE B.
