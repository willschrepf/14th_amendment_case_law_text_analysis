Argued January 8, 2013—Decided March 20, 2013\nThe federal Medicaid statute’s anti-lien provision, 42 U. S. C.\n  §1396p(a)(1), pre-empts a State’s effort to take any portion of a Medi-\n  caid beneficiary’s tort judgment or settlement not “designated as\n  payments for medical care,” Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human\n  Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547 U. S. 268, 284. A North Carolina statute re-\n  quires that up to one-third of any damages recovered by a beneficiary\n  for a tortious injury be paid to the State to reimburse it for payments\n  it made for medical treatment on account of the injury.\n     Respondent E. M. A. was born with multiple serious birth injuries\n  that require her to receive between 12 and 18 hours of skilled nursing\n  care per day and that will prevent her from being able to work, live\n  independently, or provide for her basic needs. North Carolina’s Med-\n  icaid program pays part of the cost of her ongoing medical care.\n  E. M. A. and her parents filed a medical malpractice suit against the\n  physician who delivered her and the hospital where she was born.\n  They presented expert testimony estimating their damages to exceed\n  $42 million, but they ultimately settled for $2.8 million, due in large\n  part to insurance policy limits. The settlement did not allocate mon-\n  ey among their various medical and nonmedical claims. In approving\n  the settlement, the state court placed one-third of the recovery into\n  escrow pending a judicial determination of the amount of the lien\n  owed by E. M. A. to the State. E. M. A. and her parents then sought\n  declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, claiming\n  that the State’s reimbursement scheme violated the Medicaid anti-\n\f2                            WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    lien provision. While that litigation was pending, the North Carolina\n    Supreme Court held in another case that the irrebuttable statutory\n    one-third presumption was a reasonable method for determining the\n    amount due the State for medical expenses. The Federal District\n    Court, in the instant case, agreed. But the Fourth Circuit vacated\n    and remanded, concluding that the State’s statutory scheme could\n    not be reconciled with Ahlborn.\nHeld: The federal anti-lien provision pre-empts North Carolina’s irre-\n buttable statutory presumption that one-third of a tort recovery is at-\n tributable to medical expenses. Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) In Ahlborn, the Court held that the federal Medicaid statute\n sets both a floor and a ceiling on a State’s potential share of a benefi-\n ciary’s tort recovery. Federal law requires an assignment to the\n State of “the right to recover that portion of a settlement that repre-\n sents payments for medical care,” but also “precludes attachment or\n encumbrance of the remainder of the settlement.” 547 U. S., at 282,\n 284. Ahlborn did not, however, resolve the question of how to deter-\n mine what portion of a settlement represents payment for medical\n care. As North Carolina construes its statute, when the State’s Med-\n icaid expenditures exceed one-third of a beneficiary’s tort recovery,\n the statute establishes a conclusive presumption that one-third of\n the recovery represents compensation for medical expenses, even if the\n settlement or verdict expressly allocates a lower percentage of the\n judgment to medical expenses. Pp. 4–7.\n    (b) North Carolina’s law is pre-empted insofar as it would permit\n the State to take a portion of a Medicaid beneficiary’s tort judgment\n or settlement not designated for medical care. It directly conflicts\n with the federal Medicaid statute and therefore “must give way.”\n PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U. S. ___, ___. The state law has no pro-\n cess for determining what portion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery is\n attributable to medical expenses. Instead, the State has picked an\n arbitrary percentage and by statutory command labeled that portion\n of a beneficiary’s tort recovery as representing payment for medical\n care. A State may not evade pre-emption through creative statutory\n interpretation or description, “framing” its law in a way that is at\n odds with the statute’s intended operation and effect. National Meat\n Assn. v. Harris, 565 U. S. ___, ___. North Carolina’s argument, if ac-\n cepted, would frustrate the Medicaid anti-lien provision in the con-\n text of tort recoveries. It lacks any limiting principle: If a State could\n arbitrarily designate one-third of any recovery as payment for medi-\n cal expenses, it could arbitrarily designate half or all of the recovery\n in the same way. The State offers no evidence showing that its allo-\n cation is reasonable in the mine run of cases, and the law provides no\n mechanism for determining whether its allocation is reasonable in\n\f                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  any particular case.\n     No estimate of an allocation will be necessary where there has been\n  a judicial finding or approval of an allocation between medical and\n  nonmedical damages. In some cases, including Ahlborn, this binding\n  stipulation or judgment will attribute to medical expenses less than\n  one-third of the settlement. Yet even in these circumstances, North\n  Carolina’s statute would permit the State to take one-third of the to-\n  tal recovery. A conflict thus exists between North Carolina’s law and\n  the Medicaid anti-lien provision.\n     This case is not as clear-cut as Ahlborn was, for here there was no\n  such stipulation or judgment. But Ahlborn’s reasoning and the fed-\n  eral statute’s design contemplate that possibility: They envisioned\n  that a judicial or administrative proceeding would be necessary\n  where a beneficiary and the State are unable to agree on what por-\n  tion of a settlement represents compensation for medical expenses.\n  See 547 U. S., at 288. North Carolina’s irrebuttable, one-size-fits-all\n  statutory presumption is incompatible with the Medicaid Act’s clear\n  mandate that a State may not demand any portion of a beneficiary’s\n  tort recovery except the share that is attributable to medical ex-\n  penses.

S. C. §1396p(a)(1). The anti-lien provision pre-empts a\nState’s effort to take any portion of a Medicaid benefi-\nciary’s tort judgment or settlement not “designated as pay-\nments for medical care.” Arkansas Dept. of Health and\nHuman Servs. v. Ahlborn, 547 U. S. 268, 284 (2006).\nNorth Carolina has enacted a statute requiring that up to\none-third of any damages recovered by a beneficiary for a\ntortious injury be paid to the State to reimburse it for pay-\nments it made for medical treatment on account of the in-\njury. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §108A–57 (Lexis 2011);\nAndrews v. Haygood, 362 N. C. 599, 604–605, 669 S. E. 2d\n310, 314 (2008). The question presented is whether the\nNorth Carolina statute is compatible with the federal anti-\nlien provision.\n\f2                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  When respondent E. M. A. was born in February 2000,\nshe suffered multiple serious birth injuries which left her\ndeaf, blind, and unable to sit, walk, crawl, or talk. The\ninjuries also cause her to suffer from mental retardation\nand a seizure disorder. She requires between 12 and 18\nhours of skilled nursing care per day. She will not be able\nto work, live independently, or provide for her basic needs.\nThe cost of her ongoing medical care is paid in part by the\nState of North Carolina’s Medicaid program.\n  In February 2003, E. M. A. and her parents filed a\nmedical malpractice suit in North Carolina state court\nagainst the physician who delivered E. M. A. at birth and\nthe hospital where she was born. The expert witnesses for\nE. M. A. and her parents in that proceeding estimated\ndamages in excess of $42 million for medical and life-care\nexpenses, loss of future earning capacity, and other as-\nsorted expenses such as architectural renovations to their\nhome and specialized transportation equipment. App. 91–\n112. By far the largest part of this estimate was for\n“Skilled Home Care,” totaling more than $37 million over\nE. M. A.’s lifetime. Id., at 112. E. M. A. and her parents\nalso sought damages for her pain and suffering and for\nher parents’ emotional distress. Id., at 64–65, 67–68, 72–73,\n75–76. Their experts did not estimate the damages in\nthese last two categories.\n  Assisted by a mediator, the parties began settlement\nnegotiations. E. M. A. and her parents informed the North\nCarolina Department of Health and Human Services of\nthe negotiations. The department had a statutory right\nto intervene in the malpractice suit and participate in the\nsettlement negotiations in order to obtain reimbursement\nfor the medical expenses it paid on E. M. A.’s behalf, up to\none-third of the total recovery. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n§§108A–57, 108A–59. It elected not to do so, though its\nrepresentative informed E. M. A. and her parents that the\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState’s Medicaid program had expended $1.9 million for\nE. M. A.’s medical care, which it would seek to recover\nfrom any tort judgment or settlement.\n   In November 2006, the court approved a $2.8 million\nsettlement. The amount, apparently, was dictated in large\npart by the policy limits on the defendants’ medical mal-\npractice insurance coverage. See Brief for Respondents 5.\nThe settlement agreement did not allocate the money\namong the different claims E. M. A. and her parents had\nadvanced. In approving the settlement the court placed\none-third of the $2.8 million recovery into an interest-\nbearing escrow account “until such time as the actual\namount of the lien owed by [E. M. A.] to [the State] is con-\nclusively judicially determined.” App. 87.\n   E. M. A. and her parents then filed this action under\nRev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of North Carolina.\nThey sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing\nthat the State’s reimbursement scheme violated the Medi-\ncaid anti-lien provision, §1396p(a)(1). While that litiga-\ntion was pending, the North Carolina Supreme Court con-\nfronted the same question in Andrews, supra. It held that\nthe irrebuttable statutory presumption that one-third of\na Medicaid beneficiary’s tort recovery is attributable to\nmedical expenses was “a reasonable method for determin-\ning the State’s medical reimbursements.” Id., at 604, 669\nS. E. 2d, at 314. The United States District Court, in the\ninstant case, agreed. Armstrong v. Cansler, 722 F. Supp.\n2d 653 (2010).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated and\nremanded. E. M. A. v. Cansler, 674 F. 3d 290 (2012). It\nconcluded that North Carolina’s statutory scheme could\nnot be reconciled with “Ahlborn’s clear holding that the\ngeneral anti-lien provision in federal Medicaid law prohib-\nits a state from recovering any portion of a settlement or\njudgment not attributable to medical expenses.” Id., at\n\f4                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n310. In some cases, the court reasoned, the actual portion\nof a beneficiary’s tort recovery representing payment for\nmedical care would be less than one-third. North Caro-\nlina’s statutory presumption that one-third of a tort recov-\nery is attributable to medical expenses therefore must be\n“subject to adversarial testing” in a judicial or administra-\ntive proceeding. Id., at 311.\n   To resolve the conflict between the opinion of the Court\nof Appeals in this case and the decision of the North Caro-\nlina Supreme Court in Andrews, this Court granted certio-\nrari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                              II\n   At issue is the interaction between certain provisions of\nthe federal Medicaid statute and state law. Congress has\ndirected States, in administering their Medicaid programs,\nto seek reimbursement for medical expenses incurred on\nbehalf of beneficiaries who later recover from third-party\ntortfeasors. States must require beneficiaries “to assign\nthe State any rights . . . to support (specified as support\nfor the purpose of medical care by a court or administra-\ntive order) and to payment for medical care from any third\nparty.” 42 U. S. C. §1396k(a)(1)(A). States receiving Medi-\ncaid funds must also\n    “ha[ve] in effect laws under which, to the extent that\n    payment has been made under the State plan for med-\n    ical assistance for health care items or services fur-\n    nished to an individual, the State is considered to\n    have acquired the rights of such individual to pay-\n    ment by any other party for such health care items or\n    services.” §1396a(a)(25)(H).\n  A separate provision of the Medicaid statute, however,\nexists in some tension with these requirements. It says\nthat, with exceptions not relevant here, “[n]o lien may be\nimposed against the property of any individual prior to his\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndeath on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid\non his behalf under the State plan.” §1396p(a)(1).\n   In Ahlborn, the Court addressed this tension and held\nthat the Medicaid statute sets both a floor and a ceiling\non a State’s potential share of a beneficiary’s tort recovery.\nFederal law requires an assignment to the State of “the\nright to recover that portion of a settlement that repre-\nsents payments for medical care,” but it also “precludes\nattachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the set-\ntlement.” 547 U. S., at 282, 284. This is so because the\nbeneficiary has a property right in the proceeds of the\nsettlement, bringing it within the ambit of the anti-lien\nprovision. Id., at 285. That property right is subject to\nthe specific statutory “exception” requiring a State to seek\nreimbursement for medical expenses paid on the benefi-\nciary’s behalf, but the anti-lien provision protects the\nbeneficiary’s interest in the remainder of the settlement.\nId., at 284.\n   A question the Court had no occasion to resolve in Ahl-\nborn is how to determine what portion of a settlement\nrepresents payment for medical care. The parties in that\ncase stipulated that about 6 percent of respondent Ahl-\nborn’s tort recovery (approximately $35,600 of a $550,000\nsettlement) represented compensation for medical care.\nId., at 274. The Court nonetheless anticipated the concern\nthat some settlements would not include an itemized\nallocation. It also recognized the possibility that Medicaid\nbeneficiaries and tortfeasors might collaborate to allocate\nan artificially low portion of a settlement to medical ex-\npenses. The Court noted that these problems could “be\navoided either by obtaining the State’s advance agreement\nto an allocation or, if necessary, by submitting the matter\nto a court for decision.” Id., at 288.\n   North Carolina has attempted a different approach. Its\nstatute provides:\n\f6                       WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    “Notwithstanding any other provisions of the law, to\n    the extent of payments under this Part, the State, or\n    the county providing medical assistance benefits, shall\n    be subrogated to all rights of recovery, contractual\n    or otherwise, of the beneficiary of this assistance . . . .\n    The county attorney, or an attorney retained by the\n    county or the State or both, or an attorney retained by\n    the beneficiary of the assistance if this attorney has\n    actual notice of payments made under this Part shall\n    enforce this section. Any attorney retained by the\n    beneficiary of the assistance shall, out of the proceeds\n    obtained on behalf of the beneficiary by settlement\n    with, judgment against, or otherwise from a third\n    party by reason of injury or death, distribute to the\n    Department the amount of assistance paid by the\n    Department on behalf of or to the beneficiary, as\n    prorated with the claims of all others having medical\n    subrogation rights or medical liens against the\n    amount received or recovered, but the amount paid to\n    the Department shall not exceed one-third of the gross\n    amount obtained or recovered.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n    §108A–57(a).\n  Before Ahlborn was decided, North Carolina and the\nstate courts interpreted this statute to allow the State to\n“recover the costs of medical treatment provided . . . even\nwhen the funds received by the [beneficiary] are not re-\nimbursement for medical expenses.” Campbell v. North\nCarolina Dept. of Human Resources, 153 N. C. App. 305,\n307–308, 569 S. E. 2d 670, 672 (2002). See also Ezell\nv. Grace Hospital, Inc., 360 N. C. 529, 631 S. E. 2d\n131 (2006) (per curiam). Under Ahlborn, however, this\nconstruction of the statute is at odds with the Medicaid\nanti-lien provision, which “precludes attachment or encum-\nbrance” of any portion of a settlement not “designated as\npayments for medical care.” 547 U. S., at 284.\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In response to Ahlborn, the State advanced—and the\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court in Andrews accepted—\na new interpretation of its statute. Under this interpreta-\ntion the statute “defines ‘the portion of the settlement that\nrepresents payment for medical expenses’ as the lesser of\nthe State’s past medical expenditures or one-third of the\nplaintiff ’s total recovery.” Andrews, 362 N. C., at 604,\n669 S. E. 2d, at 314. In other words, when the State’s\nMedicaid expenditures on behalf of a beneficiary exceed\none-third of the beneficiary’s tort recovery, the statute\nestablishes a conclusive presumption that one-third of the\nrecovery represents compensation for medical expenses.\nUnder this reading of the statute the presumption oper-\nates even if the settlement or a jury verdict expressly\nallocates a lower percentage of the judgment to medical\nexpenses. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10, 16–17. Cf. Andrews,\nsupra, at 602–604, 669 S. E. 2d, at 313.\n                               III\n\n                                A\n\n  Under the Supremacy Clause, “[w]here state and federal\nlaw ‘directly conflict,’ state law must give way.” PLIVA,\nInc. v. Mensing, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11).\nThe Medicaid anti-lien provision prohibits a State from\nmaking a claim to any part of a Medicaid beneficiary’s\ntort recovery not “designated as payments for medical care.”\nAhlborn, supra, at 284. North Carolina’s statute, there-\nfore, is pre-empted if, and insofar as, it would operate that\nway.\n  And it is pre-empted for that reason. The defect in\n§108A–57 is that it sets forth no process for determining\nwhat portion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery is attributable\nto medical expenses. Instead, North Carolina has picked\nan arbitrary number—one-third—and by statutory com-\nmand labeled that portion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery\nas representing payment for medical care. Pre-emption is\n\f8                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot a matter of semantics. A State may not evade the\npre-emptive force of federal law by resorting to creative\nstatutory interpretation or description at odds with the\nstatute’s intended operation and effect.\n   A similar issue was presented last Term, in National\nMeat Assn. v. Harris, 565 U. S. ___ (2012). That case\ninvolved the pre-emptive scope of the Federal Meat In-\nspection Act, 21 U. S. C. §601 et seq. The Act prohibited\nStates from imposing “ ‘[r]equirements . . . with respect to\npremises, facilities and operations’ ” at federally regulated\nslaughterhouses. National Meat Assn., 565 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 4) (quoting §678). The State of California\nhad enacted a law that prohibited slaughterhouses from\n(among other things) selling meat from nonambulatory ani-\nmals for human consumption.

Cali-\nfornia sought to defend the law on the ground that it did\nnot regulate the activities of slaughterhouses but instead\nrestricted what type of meat could be sold in the market-\nplace after the animals had been butchered. 565 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 9–10).\n   The Court rejected that argument. It recognized that\nif the argument were to prevail, “then any State could im-\npose any regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it\nas a ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way\nthe State disapproved. That would make a mockery of the\n[Act’s] preemption provision.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIn a pre-emption case, the Court held, a proper analysis\nrequires consideration of what the state law in fact does,\nnot how the litigant might choose to describe it.\n   That reasoning controls here. North Carolina’s argu-\nment, if accepted, would frustrate the Medicaid anti-lien\nprovision in the context of tort recoveries. The argument\nlacks any limiting principle: If a State arbitrarily may\ndesignate one-third of any recovery as payment for medi-\ncal expenses, there is no logical reason why it could not\n\f                   Cite as: 568 U.

In Ahlborn, the State of Arkansas, under\nthis rationale, would have succeeded in claiming the full\namount it sought from the beneficiary had it been more\ncreative and less candid in describing the effect of its full-\nreimbursement law.\n   Here the State concedes that it would be “difficult . . . to\ndefend” a law purporting to allocate most or all of a benefi-\nciary’s tort recovery to medical expenses. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n20. That is true; but, as a doctrinal matter, it is no eas-\nier to defend North Carolina’s across-the-board allocation\nof one-third of all beneficiaries’ tort recoveries to medical ex-\npenses. The problem is not that it is an unreasonable ap-\nproximation in all cases. In some cases, it may well be a\nfair estimate. But the State provides no evidence to sub-\nstantiate its claim that the one-third allocation is reason-\nable in the mine run of cases. Nor does the law provide\na mechanism for determining whether it is a reasonable\napproximation in any particular case.\n   In some instances, no estimate will be necessary or\nappropriate. When there has been a judicial finding or\napproval of an allocation between medical and nonmedical\ndamages—in the form of either a jury verdict, court de-\ncree, or stipulation binding on all parties—that is the end\nof the matter. Ahlborn was a case of this sort. All parties\n(including the State of Arkansas) stipulated that approxi-\nmately 6 percent of the plaintiff ’s settlement represented\npayment for medical costs. 547 U. S., at 274. In other\ncases a settlement may not be reached and the judge or\njury, in its findings, may make an allocation. With a\nstipulation or judgment under this procedure, the anti-lien\nprovision protects from state demand the portion of a\nbeneficiary’s tort recovery that the stipulation or judgment\ndoes not attribute to medical expenses.\n   North Carolina’s statute, however, operates to allow the\nState to take one-third of the total recovery, even if a\n\f10                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproper stipulation or judgment attributes a smaller per-\ncentage to medical expenses. Consider the facts of Ahl-\nborn. There, only $35,581.47 of the beneficiary’s settle-\nment “constituted reimbursement for medical payments\nmade.” Ibid. North Carolina’s statute, had it been applied\nin Ahlborn, would have allowed the State to claim\n$183,333.33 (one-third of the beneficiary’s $550,000 set-\ntlement). A conflict thus exists between North Carolina’s\nlaw and the Medicaid anti-lien provision.\n   The instant case, to be sure, is not quite so clear cut; for\nthere was no allocation of the settlement by either judi-\ncial decree or binding stipulation of the parties. But the\nreasoning of Ahlborn and the design of the federal statute\ncontemplate that possibility. When the State and the\nbeneficiary are unable to agree on an allocation, Ahlborn\nnoted, the parties could “submi[t] the matter to a court for\ndecision.” Id., at 288.\n   The facts of the present case demonstrate why Ahlborn\nanticipated that a judicial or administrative proceeding\nwould be necessary in that situation. Of the damages\nstemming from the injuries E. M. A. suffered at birth, it is\napparent that a quite substantial share must be allocated\nto the skilled home care she will require for the rest of\nher life. See App. 112. It also may be necessary to consider\nhow much E. M. A. and her parents could have expected to\nreceive as compensation for their other tort claims had the\nsuit proceeded to trial. An irrebuttable, one-size-fits-all\nstatutory presumption is incompatible with the Medicaid\nAct’s clear mandate that a State may not demand any por-\ntion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery except the share that\nis attributable to medical expenses.\n                            B\n  North Carolina offers responses to this reasoning, but\nnone is persuasive.\n  First, the State asserts that it is doing nothing more\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthan what Ahlborn said it could do: “adop[t] special rules\nand procedures for allocating tort settlements.” 547 U. S.,\nat 288, n. 18. This misreads Ahlborn. There the Court,\nciting an amicus brief, referred to judicial proceedings\nsome States had established for allocating tort settlements\nwhere necessary for insurance or tax purposes. See Brief\nfor Association of Trial Lawyers of America, O. T. 2005,\nNo. 04–1506, pp. 20–21 (citing Henning v. Wineman, 306\nN. W. 2d 550 (Minn. 1981), and Rimes v. State Farm Mut.\nAuto. Ins. Co., 106 Wis. 2d 263, 316 N. W. 2d 348 (1982)).\nThose examples illustrated the kind of “special rules and\nprocedures for allocating tort settlements” that Ahlborn con-\nsidered. The decision did not endorse irrebuttable pre-\nsumptions that designate some arbitrary fraction of a tort\njudgment to medical expenses in all cases.\n   Second, North Carolina contends that its law falls with-\nin the scope of a State’s traditional authority to regulate\ntort actions, including the amount of damages that a party\nmay recover. This argument begins from a correct prem-\nise: In our federal system, there is no question that States\npossess the “traditional authority to provide tort remedies\nto their citizens” as they see fit. Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee\nCorp., 464 U. S. 238, 248 (1984). But North Carolina’s law\nis not an exercise of the State’s general authority to regu-\nlate its tort system. It does not limit tort plaintiffs’ ability\nto recover for certain types of nonmedical damages, and\nit does not say that medical damages are to be privileged\nabove other damages in tort suits. All it seeks to do is to\nallocate the share of damages attributable to medical\nexpenses in tort suits brought by Medicaid beneficiaries.\nA statute that singles out Medicaid beneficiaries in this\nmanner cannot avoid compliance with the federal anti-lien\nprovision merely by relying upon a connection to an area\nof traditional state regulation.\n   Third, North Carolina suggests that even though its\nallocation of one-third of a tort recovery to medical ex-\n\f12                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npenses may be arbitrary, other methods for allocating a\nrecovery would be just as arbitrary. In the State’s view\nthere is no “ascertainable ‘true value’ of [a] case that\nshould control what portion of any settlement is subject\nto the State’s third-party recovery rights.” Brief for Peti-\ntioner 26–27. As explained earlier, allocations, while to\nsome extent perhaps not precise, need not be arbitrary. See\nsupra, at 9–10. In some cases a judgment or stipulation\nbinding on all parties will allocate the plaintiff ’s recovery\nacross different claims. Where no such judgment or stipu-\nlation exists, a fair allocation of such a settlement may be\ndifficult to determine. Trial judges and trial lawyers,\nhowever, can find objective benchmarks to make projec-\ntions of the damages the plaintiff likely could have proved\nhad the case gone to trial.\n   In the instant case, for example, the North Carolina\ntrial court approved the settlement only after finding that\nit constituted “fair and just compensation” to E. M. A. and\nher parents for her “severe and debilitating injuries”; for\n“medical and life care expenses” her condition will require;\nand for “severe emotional distress” from her injuries. App.\n82. What portion of this lump-sum settlement constitutes\n“fair and just compensation” for each individual claim will\ndepend both on how likely E. M. A. and her parents would\nhave been to prevail on the claims at trial and how much\nthey reasonably could have expected to receive on each\nclaim if successful, in view of damages awarded in compa-\nrable tort cases.\n   This relates to North Carolina’s fourth argument: that\nit would be “wasteful, time consuming, and costly” to hold\n“frequent mini-trials” in order to divide a settlement be-\ntween medical and nonmedical expenses. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 28. Even if that were true, it would not relieve\nthe State of its obligation to comply with the terms of the\nMedicaid anti-lien provision. And it is not true as a\ngeneral proposition. States have considerable latitude to\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U.

Sixteen States\nand the District of Columbia provide for hearings of this\nsort, and there is no indication that they have proved bur-\ndensome. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–\n29, and n. 7. See, e.g., Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Ann.\n§14124.76(a) (West 2011); Mo. Rev. Stat. §§208.215.9–11\n(2012); Tenn. Code Ann. §§71–5–117(g)–(i) (2012); In re\nE. B., 229 W. Va. 435, ___, 729 S. E. 2d 270, 297 (2012).\nMany of these States have established rebuttable pre-\nsumptions and adjusted burdens of proof to ensure that\nspeculative assessments of a plaintiff ’s likely recovery do\nnot defeat the State’s right to recover medical costs, a\nconcern North Carolina raises. See, e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat.\n§346–37(h) (2011 Cum. Supp.) (rebuttable presumption of\na one-third allocation); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 118E, §22(c)\n(West 2010) (rebuttable presumption of full reimburse-\nment); Okla. Stat., Tit. 63, §5051.1(D)(1)(d) (West 2011)\n(rebuttable presumption of full reimbursement, “unless a\nmore limited allocation of damages to medical expenses is\nshown by clear and convincing evidence”). Without hold-\ning that these rules are necessarily compliant with the\nfederal statute, it can be concluded that they are more\naccurate than the procedure North Carolina has enacted.\n  The task of dividing a tort settlement is a familiar one.\nIn a variety of settings, state and federal courts are called\nupon to separate lump-sum settlements or jury awards\ninto categories to satisfy different claims to a portion of\nthe moneys recovered. See supra, at 11. See also, e.g.,\nGreen v. Commissioner, 507 F. 3d 857, 867–868 (CA5\n2007) (separation of compensatory from noncompensatory\ndamages for tax purposes); Donnel v. United States, 50\nFed. Cl. 375, 386–387 (2001) (separation of employee\nseverance bonus from other payments for tax purposes);\nIn re Harrison, 306 B. R. 172, 182–183 (Bkrtcy. Ct.

App. 2005) (separation of economic\nfrom noneconomic damages for purposes of insurance sub-\nrogation); Spangler v. North Star Drilling Co., 552 So.\n2d 673, 685 (La. App. 1989) (separation of past dam-\nages from future damages for purposes of calculating pre-\njudgment interest). Indeed, North Carolina itself uses a\njudicial allocation procedure to ascertain the portion of a\nsettlement subject to subrogation in a workers’ compensa-\ntion suit. It instructs trial courts to\n     “consider the anticipated amount of prospective com-\n     pensation the employer or workers’ compensation car-\n     rier is likely to pay to the employee in the future, the\n     net recovery to plaintiff, the likelihood of the plaintiff\n     prevailing at trial or on appeal, the need for finality in\n     the litigation, and any other factors the court deems\n     just and reasonable.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §97–\n     10.2(j) (Lexis 2011).\nNorth Carolina would be on sounder footing had it adopted\na similar procedure for allocating Medicaid beneficiaries’\ntort recoveries. It might also consider a different one\nalong the lines of what other States have done in Medicaid\nreimbursement cases.\n  The State thus has ample means available to allocate\nMedicaid beneficiaries’ tort recoveries in an efficient man-\nner that complies with federal law. Indeed, if States are\nconcerned that case-by-case judicial allocations will prove\nunwieldy, they may even be able to adopt ex ante adminis-\ntrative criteria for allocating medical and nonmedical\nexpenses, provided that these criteria are backed by evi-\ndence suggesting that they are likely to yield reasonable\nresults in the mine run of cases. What they cannot do is\nwhat North Carolina did here: adopt an arbitrary, one-\nsize-fits-all allocation for all cases.\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U.

The statute is silent on the question.\nIt simply says that a State may recover the amount of\n“payment” that the State has made on behalf of the\nvictim “for medical assistance for health care items or\nservices” from funds that “any other party” has paid “for\nsuch health care items or services.”            42 U. S. C.\n§1396a(a)(25)(H). Moreover, the question focuses upon\na comparatively minor matter of statutory detail, not a\nmajor issue of far-reaching statutory policy. It concerns\neveryday administration. It calls for expertise of a kind\nthat the administering agency is more likely than a court\nto possess. And any of several different answers to the\n\f2                       WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nquestion would seem reasonable. Under these circum-\nstances, normally we should find that Congress delegated\nto the agency authority to fill the statutory gap, and we\nshould uphold the agency’s conclusion as long as it is\nreasonable. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984).\n   Here, however, the agency did not engage in rulemaking\nprocedures, it did not carefully consider differing points of\nview of those affected, it did not set forth its views in a\nmanual intended for widespread use, nor has it in any\nother way announced an interpretation that Congress\nwould have “intended . . . to carry the force of law.” United\nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 221 (2001). Indeed,\nthe agency does not claim that it exercised any dele-\ngated legislative power.\n   Neither do the documents in which the agency set forth\nits position (a memorandum and a letter) have much\n“ ‘power to persuade.’ ” Christensen v. Harris County, 529\nU. S. 576, 587 (2000) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944)). Their reasoning is skimpy.\nAnd the conclusion now advanced by the agency repre-\nsents a radical departure from the agency’s previous posi-\ntion. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a, 141a–142a. Thus,\nthe Solicitor General does not ask us to defer to the agen-\ncy’s views—and understandably so.\n   Nonetheless, the Administrative Procedure Act is not\nthe tax code. And cases that seek to determine whether\nCongress intended courts to give weight to agency views\nprovide rules of thumb, general principles meant to guide\ninterpretation, not rigid rules that narrowly confine it.\nThey seek to advance Congress’ intent as embodied in\nparticular statutory schemes by helping courts to deter-\nmine whether, and how, Congress intended those courts to\nrespect an agency’s expertise when reasonably exercised\nin particular cases. They seek to allocate the law-\ninterpreting function between court and agency in a way\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U.

In\nparticular, they do not set forth all-encompassing absolute\nrules, impervious to nuance and admitting of no excep-\ntions. Felix Frankfurter’s observation, made many years\nago, remains valid today: “The problems subsumed by . . .\n‘administrative discretion’ . . . must be related to . . . the\nparticular interest . . . as to which ‘administrative discre-\ntion’ is exercised.” The Task of Administrative Law, 75\nU. Pa. L. Rev. 614, 619–620 (1927). That is to say, “the\nstandard doctrines of administrative law . . . should not\nbe taken too rigidly.” Jaffe, Administrative Law: Burden\nof Proof and Scope of Review, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 914, 918\n(1966).\n   Thus, even though this case does not fall directly within\na case-defined category, such as “Chevron deference,”\n“Skidmore deference,” “Beth Israel deference,” “Seminole\nRock deference,” or deference as defined by some other\ncase, I believe the agency, in taking a position, nonethe-\nless retains some small but special “power to persuade.”\nSkidmore, supra, at 140. See generally Eskridge & Baer,\nThe Continuum of Deference: Supreme Court Treatment\nof Agency Statutory Interpretations from Chevron to Ham-\ndan, 96 Geo. L. J. 1083 (2008). And I would conse-\nquently to some degree take account of, and respect, the\nagency’s judgment.\n   I cannot measure the degree of deference with the preci-\nsion of a mariner measuring a degree of latitude. But it\nis still worth noting that the agency’s determination has\nplayed some role in my own decision. That is because the\nagency, after looking into the matter more thoroughly\n(perhaps after notice-and-comment rulemaking), might\nchange its mind. Given the nature of the question and\nof the agency’s expertise, courts, I believe, should then\ngive weight to that new and different agency decision.

M. A.’s medical\nexpenses under its Medicaid plan. E. M. A. sued those al-\nleged to have caused her injuries, eventually settling for\nan amount that included, among other things, medical\nexpenses already covered by North Carolina. The federal\nMedicaid statute requires North Carolina to recoup those\nexpenses. But neither the Act nor the regulations issued\nunder it tell States how to determine what portion of a\nthird-party recovery should be attributed to medical ex-\npenses. The Court concludes that North Carolina’s law\naddressing that question is nonetheless preempted by the\nAct.\n   The Court’s reading of the Act, while plausible, is not\ncompelled by the statutory text or our precedent. It has\nthe unfortunate consequence of denying flexibility to the\nStates—and, by necessary implication, the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services—in resolving a policy ques-\ntion with broad significance for this complicated program.\nIn short, the result is both unnecessary and unwise. I\ntherefore respectfully dissent.\n\f2                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

The basic idea is simple: The statute—as\ninterpreted by the Secretary of HHS—sets out the re-\nquirements for an eligible Medicaid program. If States\ndecide to enroll and comply with those requirements, they\nget federal money. If they don’t, they don’t. The federal\ncontribution is not enough to fully fund any State’s pro-\ngram; States contribute anywhere from 17 to 50 percent\nof the costs. See 42 U. S. C. §1396d(b) (2006 ed., Supp. V).\nThe States have considerable discretion in structuring and\nadministering their programs, subject of course to federal\nlaw and regulations.\n   In practice, it’s not always so simple. The books are\nthick with federal regulations that States must interpret\nand reconcile. By my count, at least 39 federal-court\nopinions, including one of our own, have reiterated Judge\nFriendly’s observation that Medicaid law is “almost unin-\ntelligible to the uninitiated.” See Schweiker v. Gray Pan-\nthers, 453 U. S. 34, 43 (1981) (quoting Friedman v. Berger,\n547 F. 2d 724, 727, n. 7 (CA2 1976)); see also 453 U. S., at\n43, n. 14 (quoting the District Court’s description of Medi-\ncaid in Friedman as “an aggravated assault on the English\nlanguage, resistant to attempts to understand it”). “Per-\nhaps appreciating the complexity of what it had wrought,\nCongress conferred on the Secretary exceptionally broad\nauthority to prescribe standards for applying certain sec-\ntions of the Act.” Schweiker, supra, at 43. But where\nthe law and the Secretary are silent on a specific ques-\ntion, it is up to the States—sometimes informally advised\nby the federal Centers for Medicare and Medi-\ncaid Services—to make sense of it all in running their\nprograms.\n   The relevant provisions here require that North Caro-\nlina (1) pay for certain people’s medical care, (2) make\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nreasonable efforts to recoup from liable third parties (such\nas tortfeasors and insurers) any medical expenses it paid,\nand (3) not recoup such payments by imposing a lien on\nthe beneficiary’s property. See ante, at 4–5; see also 42\nU. S. C. §1396a(a)(25)(B) (2006 ed.). To comply, North\nCarolina pays for a beneficiary’s medical expenses on the\ncondition that any such expenses the beneficiary recovers\nfrom third parties will go towards repaying the State. See\nN. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §108A–59(a) (Lexis 2011).\n  The difficulty, however, is that tort victims seldom seek\nonly medical expenses. Take this case: E. M. A. and her\nparents sought damages not only for medical expenses,\nbut for lost income, pain and suffering, and other things,\nand ended up settling all these claims for a lump sum of\n$2.8 million. Such a situation poses the question of how\nmuch North Carolina can recoup—indeed, under federal\nlaw, must recoup—from a lump sum that reflects more\nthan just medical expenses.\n  This puts North Carolina in a tight spot. If it fails to\nrecover what it must, it violates federal law. If it takes a\nbeneficiary’s property beyond medical expenses, it violates\nfederal law. Trying to navigate between these competing\nrequirements—with no interpretive guidance from the\nSecretary of HHS—North Carolina elected to resolve the\nproblem by laying out ground rules in advance, condition-\ning a beneficiary’s right to recover from third parties on\nthe beneficiary’s willingness to fully repay the State, or,\nat a minimum, define one-third of her damages as “medi-\ncal expenses,” whichever is less. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n§§108A–59(a); 108A–57(a); see also Andrews v. Haygood,\n362 N. C. 599, 603–604, 669 S. E. 2d 310, 313–314 (2008).\n                             II\n   The Court states that “[t]he problem” with North Caro-\nlina’s designation—actual expenses or one-third of the\nrecovery, whichever is less—“is not that it is an unreason-\n\f4                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nable approximation in all cases,” and acknowledges that\n“[i]n some cases, it may well be a fair estimate.” Ante,\nat 9. According to the Court, however, because North\nCarolina’s law provides no “mechanism for determining\nwhether it is a reasonable approximation in any particular\ncase,” ibid., (emphasis added), it “directly conflict[s]” with\nthe “clear mandate” of the federal Medicaid statute, and is\ntherefore preempted. Ante, at 7 (quoting PLIVA, Inc. v.\nMensing, 564 U. S. __, __ (2011) (slip op., at 11) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)), 10. This reflects a basic policy\njudgment: that segregating medical expenses from a lump-\nsum recovery must be done on a case-specific, after-the-\nfact basis, rather than pursuant to a general rule spelled\nout in advance.\n   The problem is that the Court can point to no statutory\nor regulatory requirement, much less an unambiguous\none, requiring such an approach. The federal statute,\nwhich provides that States must recoup medical expenses\nowed by third parties, and which prevents States from\nplacing a lien on a beneficiary’s property, says nothing\nabout how to comply with these two requirements in the\nevent of a settlement. See ante, at 1 (BREYER, J., concur-\nring) (“The statute is silent on the question”).\n   Nor does our case law. As the Court acknowledges, our\ndecision in Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v.\nAhlborn, was an easy one. 547 U. S. 268 (2006). There,\nthe underlying tort suit settled for $550,000, and the\nMedicaid beneficiary and the State of Arkansas stipulated\nthat only $35,581.47 of the settlement represented medi-\ncal expenses. The State nonetheless claimed it “was enti-\ntled to a lien in the amount of $215,645.30”—i.e., the total\namount paid by the State for the beneficiary’s health care.\nId., at 274. The question was whether the State could\ndemand this money in light of its stipulation that only\n$35,581.47 reflected medical expenses. The answer, of\ncourse, was no. The State is only entitled to recover medi-\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncal expenses; nothing else. So when Arkansas contended\nthat it was entitled to money the beneficiary had received\nfor something other than medical expenses, we had no\ntrouble rejecting that argument. That proposition—that\nStates may not take money that is unrelated to medical\nexpenses—does not help answer the question here: May a\nState condition Medicaid benefits on a beneficiary agree-\ning to define one-third of a tort recovery as reflecting\n“medical expenses”?\n   The Court recognizes that Ahlborn “had no occasion to\nresolve” the question “how to determine what portion of a\nsettlement represents payment for medical care,” ante, at\n5, but then promptly proceeds as if Ahlborn had done just\nthat. The Court quotes Ahlborn for the proposition that\na State may not claim any portion of a tort recovery\n“not ‘designated as payments for medical care,’ ” and then\nfaults North Carolina’s law because it “sets forth no pro-\ncess for determining what portion” is “attributable to med-\nical expenses.” Ante, at 6, 7 (quoting 547 U. S., at 284),\n7. Ahlborn spoke of “designated” amounts because, as\nnoted, there was a stipulated designation in that case.\nWhat to do when there is no such stipulation—when it’s\nnot clear “what portion of a settlement represents pay-\nment for medical care”—is a different question. The Court\nassumes the answer must be the same: that the settle-\nment must be parsed in every case, so that there is an\nactual, after-the-fact designation in every case. If the\nparties do not agree on one, as they did in Ahlborn, there\nmust be a process in place for reaching a case-specific\nattribution.\n   The nature of the “process” contemplated by the major-\nity is unclear, but it must involve an effort to determine\nwhat claims would have succeeded had there been a trial,\nwhat the damages would have been for the separate\nclaims, and so on—the very sort of inquiries settlement is\nintended to obviate. The Court talks of addressing these\n\f6                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nconcerns through “rebuttable presumptions and adjusted\nburdens of proof to ensure that speculative assessments of\na plaintiff ’s likely recovery do not defeat the State’s right\nto recover medical costs,” but ominously declines to give\nany assurance “that these rules are necessarily compliant\nwith the federal statute.” Ante, at 13.\n   Nothing in Ahlborn requires all this, and North Caro-\nlina has taken a different approach. It has adjusted its tort\nlaw to account for its obligations under federal Medicaid\nlaw by requiring that beneficiaries pay the State back in\nfull or designate one-third of any recovery as “medical ex-\npenses,” whichever is less. This approach allows bene-\nficiaries to obtain settlements, “meet[s] concerns about\nsettlement manipulation,” Ahlborn, supra, at 288, n. 18,\ncomplies with the statutory obligation that States make\nreasonable efforts to recover medical expenses from liable\nthird parties, and guarantees that the beneficiary will\nnever have to give back more than she has already re-\nceived from the State.\n   There’s nothing unusual about such an approach.\nStates define the contours of their own tort law all the\ntime, setting rules about who may recover in particular\ncircumstances, what claims may be alleged, which parties\nare liable, what defenses may be asserted, what damages\nare recoverable, and so on. Doing so does not amount to\nimposing a lien on any property to which an individual has\na vested right under state tort law. The Court says North\nCarolina cannot rely on its “traditional authority to regu-\nlate tort actions” because its rule in this case is not an\nexercise of its “general authority.” Ante, at 11. The Court\ncites no support for this vague new limitation on a State’s\npower to define tort remedies under state law, and I am\naware of none.\n   In fact, federal law says nothing about how States must\ndefine the recovery available to a Medicaid beneficiary\nsuing a third party. That silence is a good indication that\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCongress did not mean to strip States of their traditional\nauthority to regulate torts. See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555, 565 (2009) (“[I]n all pre-emption cases, and particu-\nlarly in those in which Congress has legislated in a field\nwhich the States have traditionally occupied, we start\nwith the assumption that the historic police powers of the\nStates were not to be superseded by the Federal Act un-\nless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress”\n(internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted)). The\nclosest the Medicaid Act gets to this topic is its require-\nment that States have “in effect laws under which . . . the\nState is considered to have acquired the rights of such\nindividual to payment by any other party for such health\ncare items or services.” See 42 U. S. C. §1396(a)(25)(H).\nThat Congress has said nothing else about what recovery\na State must allow, though clearly aware of the traditional\npower of States to regulate recoveries under private\nlaw, should be worth something. Cf. Bonito Boats, Inc. v.\nThunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 166–167 (1989)\n(“The case for federal pre-emption is particularly weak\nwhere Congress has indicated its awareness of the opera-\ntion of state law in a field of federal interest, and has\nnonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to\ntolerate whatever tension there [is] between them” (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The majority nonetheless dismisses North Carolina’s\nsolution as an arbitrary “one-size-fits-all” approach, ante,\nat 10, that has no “logical” endpoint; one that, if accepted,\ncould permit States to “designate half, three-quarters, or\nall of a tort recovery in the same way.” Ante, at 8, 9. This\nis an age-old objection to any line-drawing, to which Jus-\ntice Holmes provided a familiar response: “Neither are we\ntroubled by the question where to draw the line. That is\nthe question in pretty much everything worth arguing in\nthe law.” Irwin v. Gavit, 268 U. S. 161, 168 (1925). What-\never the case “as a doctrinal matter,” it is in fact “easier to\n\f8                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ndefend North Carolina’s” one-third designation than the\nCourt’s hypothetical where a State allocates all of a recov-\nery to medical expenses. Ante, at 9. In addition, the\nmajority’s hobgoblin is less frightening when we remem-\nber that North Carolina never takes back more than what\nit paid for such expenses.\n   The reasons for drawing a bright line, as North Carolina\nhas, are obvious and familiar. See generally Scalia, The\nRule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175\n(1989). Bright lines provide clear notice; here that means\nbeneficiaries know exactly where they stand with respect\nto reimbursing the State as they negotiate settlements\nwith third parties. Such clear rules are easy, cheap, and\nadministrable—laudable qualities in the context of a vast\nand intricate program. The Court’s approach, on the other\nend, requires the time of lawyers and judges, and that\ntime costs money—money better spent on providing health\ncare to the needy. Or so the State, responsible for admin-\nistering its program, could conclude, and nothing in the\nstatute, regulations, or our precedent says otherwise.\n   The majority points out that nearly one-third of the\nStates conduct hearings of the sort it contemplates. Ante,\nat 13. Good for them. The whole point of our federal\nsystem is that different States may reach different judg-\nments about how to run their own different programs.\nSuch flexibility is particularly important in this context,\nwhere Medicaid spending is the largest component of most\nstate budgets. The Court also notes that, in other areas,\ncourts have undertaken the work of “separat[ing] lump-\nsum settlements or jury awards into categories to satisfy\ndifferent claims.” Ibid. My point is not that the work\nrequired by the Court cannot be done—just that it has not\nbeen required by Congress or the Secretary.\n   On that note, it’s bad enough that the Court finds the\nState’s reasonable effort to reconcile its competing obliga-\ntions preempted. What is doubly unfortunate is that the\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCourt’s analysis necessarily implies that the Secretary’s\nhands are also tied. The Medicaid Act is Spending Clause\nlegislation, and such legislation is binding on States\nonly insofar as it is “unambiguous.” See Pennhurst State\nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981).\nIn addition, the anti-lien provision only precludes North\nCarolina’s law if, as the Court acknowledges, there is a\n“direct conflict” between the two. Ante, at 7 (quoting\nPLIVA, Inc., 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Court says—wrongly, I\nbelieve—that there is. Ante, at 10 (“An irrebuttable, one-\nsize-fits-all statutory presumption is incompatible with\nthe Medicaid Act’s clear mandate that a State may not\ndemand any portion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery except\nthe share that is attributable to medical expenses” (em-\nphasis added)). But if North Carolina’s approach directly\nconflicts with an unambiguous, clear mandate in the Act—\nsuch that any presumption against preemption is over-\ncome, see Wyeth, supra, at 565, n. 3—it’s hard to see how\nthe Secretary could adopt a similar approach. See Chev-\nron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984) (“If the intent of Con-\ngress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court,\nas well as the agency, must give effect to the unambigu-\nously expressed intent of Congress”).\n   The concurrence wishes this were not so, see ante, at 4\n(“today’s decision does not freeze the Court’s present in-\nterpretation of the statute permanently into law”), but\nfails to acknowledge the express rationale of the Court’s\nopinion. There is no other way to read the majority opin-\nion than as foreclosing what the concurrence would like to\nleave open.\n   Or is there? In exactly two sentences, the Court seems\nto falter and lose the courage of its conviction that a State\nmust have a process in place for an individual allocation\nof medical expenses in every case. The Court views the\n\f10                     WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

That thought does not resurface until\nfive pages later—and only then—when the Court says that\nStates “may even be able to adopt ex ante administrative\ncriteria for allocating medical and nonmedical expenses,\nprovided these criteria are backed by evidence suggesting\nthat they are likely to yield reasonable results in the mine\nrun of cases.” Ante, at 14.\n   I am not sure whether this is a concession that individ-\nualized hearings may not be required after all, but if it is,\nit is flatly contrary to the rest of the opinion. It is also\nquite odd to suggest that the problem with North Caro-\nlina’s law would go away if only the State provided some\nsort of study substantiating the idea that one-third was a\ngood approximation in most cases. North Carolina is not a\nfederal agency, whose actions are subject to review under\nthe Administrative Procedure Act’s “substantial evidence”\ntest. See 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(E). We have never before, in\na preemption case, put the burden on the State to compile\nan evidentiary record supporting its legislative determina-\ntion. The burden is, of course, on those challenging the\nlaw. See Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v.\nWalsh, 538 U. S. 644, 661–662 (2003) (plurality opinion)\n(“We start . . . with a presumption that the state statute\nis valid, and ask whether petitioner has shouldered the\nburden of overcoming that presumption” (citation omit-\nted)). We have said that, as a general matter, “Congress is\nnot obligated, when enacting its statutes, to make a record\nof the type that an administrative agency or court does to\naccommodate judicial review.” Turner Broadcasting Sys-\ntem, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 213 (1997) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Sovereign States should be accorded\nno less deference.\n   Keep in mind that the basis for all this is a federal law\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U.

It is hard enough to figure out what the Medi-\ncaid Act means by what it says; we should not read so\nmuch into its silence.\n  Ultimately, it is a basic policy judgment whether the\nMedicaid program is best served in this instance by\npost hoc individualized determinations, or whether the\nissue may be addressed in advance, through a general\nrule, as North Carolina has done here. See ante, at 1–2\n(BREYER, J., concurring) (“any of several different answers\nto the question would seem reasonable”). The Court can\npoint to nothing that delegates to it the prerogative to\nmake that judgment. Rather, States and the Secretary—\nworking together—should be afforded the leeway to make\ntheir joint venture a workable one.\n  Because North Carolina’s law does not conflict with\nfederal law, I would let it be. I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

A North Carolina statute re-\n  quires that up to one-third of any damages recovered by a beneficiary\n  for a tortious injury be paid to the State to reimburse it for payments\n  it made for medical treatment on account of the injury.\n     Respondent E. M. A. was born with multiple serious birth injuries\n  that require her to receive between 12 and 18 hours of skilled nursing\n  care per day and that will prevent her from being able to work, live\n  independently, or provide for her basic needs. North Carolina’s Med-\n  icaid program pays part of the cost of her ongoing medical care.\n  E. M. A. and her parents filed a medical malpractice suit against the\n  physician who delivered her and the hospital where she was born.\n  They presented expert testimony estimating their damages to exceed\n  $42 million, but they ultimately settled for $2.8 million, due in large\n  part to insurance policy limits. The settlement did not allocate mon-\n  ey among their various medical and nonmedical claims. In approving\n  the settlement, the state court placed one-third of the recovery into\n  escrow pending a judicial determination of the amount of the lien\n  owed by E. M. A. to the State. E. M. A. and her parents then sought\n  declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, claiming\n  that the State’s reimbursement scheme violated the Medicaid anti-\n\f2                            WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    lien provision. While that litigation was pending, the North Carolina\n    Supreme Court held in another case that the irrebuttable statutory\n    one-third presumption was a reasonable method for determining the\n    amount due the State for medical expenses. The Federal District\n    Court, in the instant case, agreed. But the Fourth Circuit vacated\n    and remanded, concluding that the State’s statutory scheme could\n    not be reconciled with Ahlborn.\nHeld: The federal anti-lien provision pre-empts North Carolina’s irre-\n buttable statutory presumption that one-third of a tort recovery is at-\n tributable to medical expenses. Pp. 4–16.\n    (a) In Ahlborn, the Court held that the federal Medicaid statute\n sets both a floor and a ceiling on a State’s potential share of a benefi-\n ciary’s tort recovery. Federal law requires an assignment to the\n State of “the right to recover that portion of a settlement that repre-\n sents payments for medical care,” but also “precludes attachment or\n encumbrance of the remainder of the settlement.” 547 U. S., at 282,\n 284. Ahlborn did not, however, resolve the question of how to deter-\n mine what portion of a settlement represents payment for medical\n care. As North Carolina construes its statute, when the State’s Med-\n icaid expenditures exceed one-third of a beneficiary’s tort recovery,\n the statute establishes a conclusive presumption that one-third of\n the recovery represents compensation for medical expenses, even if the\n settlement or verdict expressly allocates a lower percentage of the\n judgment to medical expenses. Pp. 4–7.\n    (b) North Carolina’s law is pre-empted insofar as it would permit\n the State to take a portion of a Medicaid beneficiary’s tort judgment\n or settlement not designated for medical care. It directly conflicts\n with the federal Medicaid statute and therefore “must give way.”\n PLIVA, Inc. v.

The state law has no pro-\n cess for determining what portion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery is\n attributable to medical expenses. Instead, the State has picked an\n arbitrary percentage and by statutory command labeled that portion\n of a beneficiary’s tort recovery as representing payment for medical\n care.

North Carolina’s argument, if ac-\n cepted, would frustrate the Medicaid anti-lien provision in the con-\n text of tort recoveries. It lacks any limiting principle: If a State could\n arbitrarily designate one-third of any recovery as payment for medi-\n cal expenses, it could arbitrarily designate half or all of the recovery\n in the same way. The State offers no evidence showing that its allo-\n cation is reasonable in the mine run of cases, and the law provides no\n mechanism for determining whether its allocation is reasonable in\n\f                     Cite as: 568 U.

In some cases, including Ahlborn, this binding\n  stipulation or judgment will attribute to medical expenses less than\n  one-third of the settlement. Yet even in these circumstances, North\n  Carolina’s statute would permit the State to take one-third of the to-\n  tal recovery.

The question presented is whether the\nNorth Carolina statute is compatible with the federal anti-\nlien provision.\n\f2                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  When respondent E. M. A. was born in February 2000,\nshe suffered multiple serious birth injuries which left her\ndeaf, blind, and unable to sit, walk, crawl, or talk. The\ninjuries also cause her to suffer from mental retardation\nand a seizure disorder. She requires between 12 and 18\nhours of skilled nursing care per day. She will not be able\nto work, live independently, or provide for her basic needs.\nThe cost of her ongoing medical care is paid in part by the\nState of North Carolina’s Medicaid program.\n  In February 2003, E. M. A. and her parents filed a\nmedical malpractice suit in North Carolina state court\nagainst the physician who delivered E. M. A. at birth and\nthe hospital where she was born. The expert witnesses for\nE. M. A. and her parents in that proceeding estimated\ndamages in excess of $42 million for medical and life-care\nexpenses, loss of future earning capacity, and other as-\nsorted expenses such as architectural renovations to their\nhome and specialized transportation equipment. App. 91–\n112. By far the largest part of this estimate was for\n“Skilled Home Care,” totaling more than $37 million over\nE. M. A.’s lifetime. Id., at 112. E. M. A. and her parents\nalso sought damages for her pain and suffering and for\nher parents’ emotional distress. Id., at 64–65, 67–68, 72–73,\n75–76. Their experts did not estimate the damages in\nthese last two categories.\n  Assisted by a mediator, the parties began settlement\nnegotiations. E. M. A. and her parents informed the North\nCarolina Department of Health and Human Services of\nthe negotiations. The department had a statutory right\nto intervene in the malpractice suit and participate in the\nsettlement negotiations in order to obtain reimbursement\nfor the medical expenses it paid on E. M. A.’s behalf, up to\none-third of the total recovery. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n§§108A–57, 108A–59. It elected not to do so, though its\nrepresentative informed E. M. A. and her parents that the\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState’s Medicaid program had expended $1.9 million for\nE. M. A.’s medical care, which it would seek to recover\nfrom any tort judgment or settlement.\n   In November 2006, the court approved a $2.8 million\nsettlement. The amount, apparently, was dictated in large\npart by the policy limits on the defendants’ medical mal-\npractice insurance coverage. See Brief for Respondents 5.\nThe settlement agreement did not allocate the money\namong the different claims E. M. A. and her parents had\nadvanced. In approving the settlement the court placed\none-third of the $2.8 million recovery into an interest-\nbearing escrow account “until such time as the actual\namount of the lien owed by [E. M. A.] to [the State] is con-\nclusively judicially determined.” App. 87.\n   E. M. A. and her parents then filed this action under\nRev.

While that litiga-\ntion was pending, the North Carolina Supreme Court con-\nfronted the same question in Andrews, supra.

It\nconcluded that North Carolina’s statutory scheme could\nnot be reconciled with “Ahlborn’s clear holding that the\ngeneral anti-lien provision in federal Medicaid law prohib-\nits a state from recovering any portion of a settlement or\njudgment not attributable to medical expenses.” Id., at\n\f4                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n310. In some cases, the court reasoned, the actual portion\nof a beneficiary’s tort recovery representing payment for\nmedical care would be less than one-third. North Caro-\nlina’s statutory presumption that one-third of a tort recov-\nery is attributable to medical expenses therefore must be\n“subject to adversarial testing” in a judicial or administra-\ntive proceeding. Id., at 311.\n   To resolve the conflict between the opinion of the Court\nof Appeals in this case and the decision of the North Caro-\nlina Supreme Court in Andrews, this Court granted certio-\nrari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                              II\n   At issue is the interaction between certain provisions of\nthe federal Medicaid statute and state law. Congress has\ndirected States, in administering their Medicaid programs,\nto seek reimbursement for medical expenses incurred on\nbehalf of beneficiaries who later recover from third-party\ntortfeasors. States must require beneficiaries “to assign\nthe State any rights . . . to support (specified as support\nfor the purpose of medical care by a court or administra-\ntive order) and to payment for medical care from any third\nparty.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §1396k(a)(1)(A). States receiving Medi-\ncaid funds must also\n    “ha[ve] in effect laws under which, to the extent that\n    payment has been made under the State plan for med-\n    ical assistance for health care items or services fur-\n    nished to an individual, the State is considered to\n    have acquired the rights of such individual to pay-\n    ment by any other party for such health care items or\n    services.” §1396a(a)(25)(H).\n  A separate provision of the Medicaid statute, however,\nexists in some tension with these requirements. It says\nthat, with exceptions not relevant here, “[n]o lien may be\nimposed against the property of any individual prior to his\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndeath on account of medical assistance paid or to be paid\non his behalf under the State plan.” §1396p(a)(1).\n   In Ahlborn, the Court addressed this tension and held\nthat the Medicaid statute sets both a floor and a ceiling\non a State’s potential share of a beneficiary’s tort recovery.\nFederal law requires an assignment to the State of “the\nright to recover that portion of a settlement that repre-\nsents payments for medical care,” but it also “precludes\nattachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the set-\ntlement.” 547 U. S., at 282, 284. This is so because the\nbeneficiary has a property right in the proceeds of the\nsettlement, bringing it within the ambit of the anti-lien\nprovision. Id., at 285. That property right is subject to\nthe specific statutory “exception” requiring a State to seek\nreimbursement for medical expenses paid on the benefi-\nciary’s behalf, but the anti-lien provision protects the\nbeneficiary’s interest in the remainder of the settlement.\nId., at 284.\n   A question the Court had no occasion to resolve in Ahl-\nborn is how to determine what portion of a settlement\nrepresents payment for medical care. The parties in that\ncase stipulated that about 6 percent of respondent Ahl-\nborn’s tort recovery (approximately $35,600 of a $550,000\nsettlement) represented compensation for medical care.\nId., at 274. The Court nonetheless anticipated the concern\nthat some settlements would not include an itemized\nallocation. It also recognized the possibility that Medicaid\nbeneficiaries and tortfeasors might collaborate to allocate\nan artificially low portion of a settlement to medical ex-\npenses. The Court noted that these problems could “be\navoided either by obtaining the State’s advance agreement\nto an allocation or, if necessary, by submitting the matter\nto a court for decision.” Id., at 288.\n   North Carolina has attempted a different approach. Its\nstatute provides:\n\f6                       WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    “Notwithstanding any other provisions of the law, to\n    the extent of payments under this Part, the State, or\n    the county providing medical assistance benefits, shall\n    be subrogated to all rights of recovery, contractual\n    or otherwise, of the beneficiary of this assistance . . . .\n    The county attorney, or an attorney retained by the\n    county or the State or both, or an attorney retained by\n    the beneficiary of the assistance if this attorney has\n    actual notice of payments made under this Part shall\n    enforce this section. Any attorney retained by the\n    beneficiary of the assistance shall, out of the proceeds\n    obtained on behalf of the beneficiary by settlement\n    with, judgment against, or otherwise from a third\n    party by reason of injury or death, distribute to the\n    Department the amount of assistance paid by the\n    Department on behalf of or to the beneficiary, as\n    prorated with the claims of all others having medical\n    subrogation rights or medical liens against the\n    amount received or recovered, but the amount paid to\n    the Department shall not exceed one-third of the gross\n    amount obtained or recovered.” N.

Under this interpreta-\ntion the statute “defines ‘the portion of the settlement that\nrepresents payment for medical expenses’ as the lesser of\nthe State’s past medical expenditures or one-third of the\nplaintiff ’s total recovery.” Andrews, 362 N.

In other words, when the State’s\nMedicaid expenditures on behalf of a beneficiary exceed\none-third of the beneficiary’s tort recovery, the statute\nestablishes a conclusive presumption that one-third of the\nrecovery represents compensation for medical expenses.\nUnder this reading of the statute the presumption oper-\nates even if the settlement or a jury verdict expressly\nallocates a lower percentage of the judgment to medical\nexpenses.

North Carolina’s statute, there-\nfore, is pre-empted if, and insofar as, it would operate that\nway.\n  And it is pre-empted for that reason. The defect in\n§108A–57 is that it sets forth no process for determining\nwhat portion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery is attributable\nto medical expenses. Instead, North Carolina has picked\nan arbitrary number—one-third—and by statutory com-\nmand labeled that portion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery\nas representing payment for medical care. Pre-emption is\n\f8                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot a matter of semantics. A State may not evade the\npre-emptive force of federal law by resorting to creative\nstatutory interpretation or description at odds with the\nstatute’s intended operation and effect.\n   A similar issue was presented last Term, in National\nMeat Assn. v.

That case\ninvolved the pre-emptive scope of the Federal Meat In-\nspection Act, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §601 et seq. The Act prohibited\nStates from imposing “ ‘[r]equirements . . . with respect to\npremises, facilities and operations’ ” at federally regulated\nslaughterhouses. National Meat Assn., 565 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 4) (quoting §678). The State of California\nhad enacted a law that prohibited slaughterhouses from\n(among other things) selling meat from nonambulatory ani-\nmals for human consumption. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5)\n(citing Cal. Penal Code Ann. §599f(b) (West 2010)). Cali-\nfornia sought to defend the law on the ground that it did\nnot regulate the activities of slaughterhouses but instead\nrestricted what type of meat could be sold in the market-\nplace after the animals had been butchered. 565 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 9–10).\n   The Court rejected that argument. It recognized that\nif the argument were to prevail, “then any State could im-\npose any regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it\nas a ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way\nthe State disapproved. That would make a mockery of the\n[Act’s] preemption provision.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIn a pre-emption case, the Court held, a proper analysis\nrequires consideration of what the state law in fact does,\nnot how the litigant might choose to describe it.\n   That reasoning controls here. North Carolina’s argu-\nment, if accepted, would frustrate the Medicaid anti-lien\nprovision in the context of tort recoveries. The argument\nlacks any limiting principle: If a State arbitrarily may\ndesignate one-third of any recovery as payment for medi-\ncal expenses, there is no logical reason why it could not\n\f                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ndesignate half, three-quarters, or all of a tort recovery in\nthe same way. In Ahlborn, the State of Arkansas, under\nthis rationale, would have succeeded in claiming the full\namount it sought from the beneficiary had it been more\ncreative and less candid in describing the effect of its full-\nreimbursement law.\n   Here the State concedes that it would be “difficult . . . to\ndefend” a law purporting to allocate most or all of a benefi-\nciary’s tort recovery to medical expenses. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n20. That is true; but, as a doctrinal matter, it is no eas-\nier to defend North Carolina’s across-the-board allocation\nof one-third of all beneficiaries’ tort recoveries to medical ex-\npenses. The problem is not that it is an unreasonable ap-\nproximation in all cases. In some cases, it may well be a\nfair estimate. But the State provides no evidence to sub-\nstantiate its claim that the one-third allocation is reason-\nable in the mine run of cases. Nor does the law provide\na mechanism for determining whether it is a reasonable\napproximation in any particular case.\n   In some instances, no estimate will be necessary or\nappropriate. When there has been a judicial finding or\napproval of an allocation between medical and nonmedical\ndamages—in the form of either a jury verdict, court de-\ncree, or stipulation binding on all parties—that is the end\nof the matter. Ahlborn was a case of this sort. All parties\n(including the State of Arkansas) stipulated that approxi-\nmately 6 percent of the plaintiff ’s settlement represented\npayment for medical costs. 547 U. S., at 274. In other\ncases a settlement may not be reached and the judge or\njury, in its findings, may make an allocation. With a\nstipulation or judgment under this procedure, the anti-lien\nprovision protects from state demand the portion of a\nbeneficiary’s tort recovery that the stipulation or judgment\ndoes not attribute to medical expenses.\n   North Carolina’s statute, however, operates to allow the\nState to take one-third of the total recovery, even if a\n\f10                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproper stipulation or judgment attributes a smaller per-\ncentage to medical expenses. Consider the facts of Ahl-\nborn. There, only $35,581.47 of the beneficiary’s settle-\nment “constituted reimbursement for medical payments\nmade.” Ibid. North Carolina’s statute, had it been applied\nin Ahlborn, would have allowed the State to claim\n$183,333.33 (one-third of the beneficiary’s $550,000 set-\ntlement). A conflict thus exists between North Carolina’s\nlaw and the Medicaid anti-lien provision.\n   The instant case, to be sure, is not quite so clear cut; for\nthere was no allocation of the settlement by either judi-\ncial decree or binding stipulation of the parties. But the\nreasoning of Ahlborn and the design of the federal statute\ncontemplate that possibility. When the State and the\nbeneficiary are unable to agree on an allocation, Ahlborn\nnoted, the parties could “submi[t] the matter to a court for\ndecision.” Id., at 288.\n   The facts of the present case demonstrate why Ahlborn\nanticipated that a judicial or administrative proceeding\nwould be necessary in that situation. Of the damages\nstemming from the injuries E. M. A. suffered at birth, it is\napparent that a quite substantial share must be allocated\nto the skilled home care she will require for the rest of\nher life. See App. 112. It also may be necessary to consider\nhow much E. M. A. and her parents could have expected to\nreceive as compensation for their other tort claims had the\nsuit proceeded to trial. An irrebuttable, one-size-fits-all\nstatutory presumption is incompatible with the Medicaid\nAct’s clear mandate that a State may not demand any por-\ntion of a beneficiary’s tort recovery except the share that\nis attributable to medical expenses.\n                            B\n  North Carolina offers responses to this reasoning, but\nnone is persuasive.\n  First, the State asserts that it is doing nothing more\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U.

S.,\nat 288, n. 18. This misreads Ahlborn.

The decision did not endorse irrebuttable pre-\nsumptions that designate some arbitrary fraction of a tort\njudgment to medical expenses in all cases.\n   Second, North Carolina contends that its law falls with-\nin the scope of a State’s traditional authority to regulate\ntort actions, including the amount of damages that a party\nmay recover. This argument begins from a correct prem-\nise: In our federal system, there is no question that States\npossess the “traditional authority to provide tort remedies\nto their citizens” as they see fit. Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111056\"><a href=\"/opinion/111056/silkwood-v-kerr-mcgee-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1984). But North Carolina’s law\nis not an exercise of the State’s general authority to regu-\nlate its tort system. It does not limit tort plaintiffs’ ability\nto recover for certain types of nonmedical damages, and\nit does not say that medical damages are to be privileged\nabove other damages in tort suits. All it seeks to do is to\nallocate the share of damages attributable to medical\nexpenses in tort suits brought by Medicaid beneficiaries.\nA statute that singles out Medicaid beneficiaries in this\nmanner cannot avoid compliance with the federal anti-lien\nprovision merely by relying upon a connection to an area\nof traditional state regulation.\n   Third, North Carolina suggests that even though its\nallocation of one-third of a tort recovery to medical ex-\n\f12                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npenses may be arbitrary, other methods for allocating a\nrecovery would be just as arbitrary. In the State’s view\nthere is no “ascertainable ‘true value’ of [a] case that\nshould control what portion of any settlement is subject\nto the State’s third-party recovery rights.” Brief for Peti-\ntioner 26–27. As explained earlier, allocations, while to\nsome extent perhaps not precise, need not be arbitrary. See\nsupra, at 9–10. In some cases a judgment or stipulation\nbinding on all parties will allocate the plaintiff ’s recovery\nacross different claims. Where no such judgment or stipu-\nlation exists, a fair allocation of such a settlement may be\ndifficult to determine. Trial judges and trial lawyers,\nhowever, can find objective benchmarks to make projec-\ntions of the damages the plaintiff likely could have proved\nhad the case gone to trial.\n   In the instant case, for example, the North Carolina\ntrial court approved the settlement only after finding that\nit constituted “fair and just compensation” to E. M. A. and\nher parents for her “severe and debilitating injuries”; for\n“medical and life care expenses” her condition will require;\nand for “severe emotional distress” from her injuries. App.\n82. What portion of this lump-sum settlement constitutes\n“fair and just compensation” for each individual claim will\ndepend both on how likely E. M. A. and her parents would\nhave been to prevail on the claims at trial and how much\nthey reasonably could have expected to receive on each\nclaim if successful, in view of damages awarded in compa-\nrable tort cases.\n   This relates to North Carolina’s fourth argument: that\nit would be “wasteful, time consuming, and costly” to hold\n“frequent mini-trials” in order to divide a settlement be-\ntween medical and nonmedical expenses.

See, e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat.\n§346–37(h) (2011 Cum. Supp.) (rebuttable presumption of\na one-third allocation); Mass. Gen.

Indeed, North Carolina itself uses a\njudicial allocation procedure to ascertain the portion of a\nsettlement subject to subrogation in a workers’ compensa-\ntion suit. It instructs trial courts to\n     “consider the anticipated amount of prospective com-\n     pensation the employer or workers’ compensation car-\n     rier is likely to pay to the employee in the future, the\n     net recovery to plaintiff, the likelihood of the plaintiff\n     prevailing at trial or on appeal, the need for finality in\n     the litigation, and any other factors the court deems\n     just and reasonable.” N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §97–\n     10.2(j) (Lexis 2011).\nNorth Carolina would be on sounder footing had it adopted\na similar procedure for allocating Medicaid beneficiaries’\ntort recoveries. It might also consider a different one\nalong the lines of what other States have done in Medicaid\nreimbursement cases.\n  The State thus has ample means available to allocate\nMedicaid beneficiaries’ tort recoveries in an efficient man-\nner that complies with federal law. Indeed, if States are\nconcerned that case-by-case judicial allocations will prove\nunwieldy, they may even be able to adopt ex ante adminis-\ntrative criteria for allocating medical and nonmedical\nexpenses, provided that these criteria are backed by evi-\ndence suggesting that they are likely to yield reasonable\nresults in the mine run of cases. What they cannot do is\nwhat North Carolina did here: adopt an arbitrary, one-\nsize-fits-all allocation for all cases.\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U.

The statute is silent on the question.\nIt simply says that a State may recover the amount of\n“payment” that the State has made on behalf of the\nvictim “for medical assistance for health care items or\nservices” from funds that “any other party” has paid “for\nsuch health care items or services.”            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n§1396a(a)(25)(H). Moreover, the question focuses upon\na comparatively minor matter of statutory detail, not a\nmajor issue of far-reaching statutory policy. It concerns\neveryday administration. It calls for expertise of a kind\nthat the administering agency is more likely than a court\nto possess. And any of several different answers to the\n\f2                       WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nquestion would seem reasonable. Under these circum-\nstances, normally we should find that Congress delegated\nto the agency authority to fill the statutory gap, and we\nshould uphold the agency’s conclusion as long as it is\nreasonable.

Thus,\nthe Solicitor General does not ask us to defer to the agen-\ncy’s views—and understandably so.\n   Nonetheless, the Administrative Procedure Act is not\nthe tax code. And cases that seek to determine whether\nCongress intended courts to give weight to agency views\nprovide rules of thumb, general principles meant to guide\ninterpretation, not rigid rules that narrowly confine it.\nThey seek to advance Congress’ intent as embodied in\nparticular statutory schemes by helping courts to deter-\nmine whether, and how, Congress intended those courts to\nrespect an agency’s expertise when reasonably exercised\nin particular cases. They seek to allocate the law-\ninterpreting function between court and agency in a way\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U.

In\nparticular, they do not set forth all-encompassing absolute\nrules, impervious to nuance and admitting of no excep-\ntions. Felix Frankfurter’s observation, made many years\nago, remains valid today: “The problems subsumed by . . .\n‘administrative discretion’ . . . must be related to . . . the\nparticular interest . . . as to which ‘administrative discre-\ntion’ is exercised.” The Task of Administrative Law, 75\nU.

Rev. 914, 918\n(1966).\n   Thus, even though this case does not fall directly within\na case-defined category, such as “Chevron deference,”\n“Skidmore deference,” “Beth Israel deference,” “Seminole\nRock deference,” or deference as defined by some other\ncase, I believe the agency, in taking a position, nonethe-\nless retains some small but special “power to persuade.”\nSkidmore, supra, at 140. See generally Eskridge & Baer,\nThe Continuum of Deference: Supreme Court Treatment\nof Agency Statutory Interpretations from Chevron to Ham-\ndan, 96 Geo. L. J. 1083 (2008). And I would conse-\nquently to some degree take account of, and respect, the\nagency’s judgment.\n   I cannot measure the degree of deference with the preci-\nsion of a mariner measuring a degree of latitude. But it\nis still worth noting that the agency’s determination has\nplayed some role in my own decision. That is because the\nagency, after looking into the matter more thoroughly\n(perhaps after notice-and-comment rulemaking), might\nchange its mind. Given the nature of the question and\nof the agency’s expertise, courts, I believe, should then\ngive weight to that new and different agency decision.

M. A.’s medical\nexpenses under its Medicaid plan. E. M. A. sued those al-\nleged to have caused her injuries, eventually settling for\nan amount that included, among other things, medical\nexpenses already covered by North Carolina. The federal\nMedicaid statute requires North Carolina to recoup those\nexpenses. But neither the Act nor the regulations issued\nunder it tell States how to determine what portion of a\nthird-party recovery should be attributed to medical ex-\npenses. The Court concludes that North Carolina’s law\naddressing that question is nonetheless preempted by the\nAct.\n   The Court’s reading of the Act, while plausible, is not\ncompelled by the statutory text or our precedent. It has\nthe unfortunate consequence of denying flexibility to the\nStates—and, by necessary implication, the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services—in resolving a policy ques-\ntion with broad significance for this complicated program.\nIn short, the result is both unnecessary and unwise.

The basic idea is simple: The statute—as\ninterpreted by the Secretary of HHS—sets out the re-\nquirements for an eligible Medicaid program. If States\ndecide to enroll and comply with those requirements, they\nget federal money. If they don’t, they don’t. The federal\ncontribution is not enough to fully fund any State’s pro-\ngram; States contribute anywhere from 17 to 50 percent\nof the costs.

To comply, North\nCarolina pays for a beneficiary’s medical expenses on the\ncondition that any such expenses the beneficiary recovers\nfrom third parties will go towards repaying the State. See\nN. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §108A–59(a) (Lexis 2011).\n  The difficulty, however, is that tort victims seldom seek\nonly medical expenses. Take this case: E. M. A. and her\nparents sought damages not only for medical expenses,\nbut for lost income, pain and suffering, and other things,\nand ended up settling all these claims for a lump sum of\n$2.8 million. Such a situation poses the question of how\nmuch North Carolina can recoup—indeed, under federal\nlaw, must recoup—from a lump sum that reflects more\nthan just medical expenses.\n  This puts North Carolina in a tight spot. If it fails to\nrecover what it must, it violates federal law. If it takes a\nbeneficiary’s property beyond medical expenses, it violates\nfederal law. Trying to navigate between these competing\nrequirements—with no interpretive guidance from the\nSecretary of HHS—North Carolina elected to resolve the\nproblem by laying out ground rules in advance, condition-\ning a beneficiary’s right to recover from third parties on\nthe beneficiary’s willingness to fully repay the State, or,\nat a minimum, define one-third of her damages as “medi-\ncal expenses,” whichever is less.

According to the Court, however, because North\nCarolina’s law provides no “mechanism for determining\nwhether it is a reasonable approximation in any particular\ncase,” ibid., (emphasis added), it “directly conflict[s]” with\nthe “clear mandate” of the federal Medicaid statute, and is\ntherefore preempted. Ante, at 7 (quoting PLIVA, Inc. v.\nMensing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219510\"><a href=\"/opinion/219510/pliva-inc-v-mensing/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">__, __ (2011) (slip op., at 11) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)), 10. This reflects a basic policy\njudgment: that segregating medical expenses from a lump-\nsum recovery must be done on a case-specific, after-the-\nfact basis, rather than pursuant to a general rule spelled\nout in advance.\n   The problem is that the Court can point to no statutory\nor regulatory requirement, much less an unambiguous\none, requiring such an approach. The federal statute,\nwhich provides that States must recoup medical expenses\nowed by third parties, and which prevents States from\nplacing a lien on a beneficiary’s property, says nothing\nabout how to comply with these two requirements in the\nevent of a settlement. See ante, at 1 (BREYER, J., concur-\nring) (“The statute is silent on the question”).\n   Nor does our case law. As the Court acknowledges, our\ndecision in Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v.\nAhlborn, was an easy one. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145661\"><a href=\"/opinion/145661/arkansas-dept-of-health-and-human-servs-v-ahlborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006). There,\nthe underlying tort suit settled for $550,000, and the\nMedicaid beneficiary and the State of Arkansas stipulated\nthat only $35,581.47 of the settlement represented medi-\ncal expenses. The State nonetheless claimed it “was enti-\ntled to a lien in the amount of $215,645.30”—i.e., the total\namount paid by the State for the beneficiary’s health care.\nId., at 274. The question was whether the State could\ndemand this money in light of its stipulation that only\n$35,581.47 reflected medical expenses. The answer, of\ncourse, was no. The State is only entitled to recover medi-\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncal expenses; nothing else. So when Arkansas contended\nthat it was entitled to money the beneficiary had received\nfor something other than medical expenses, we had no\ntrouble rejecting that argument. That proposition—that\nStates may not take money that is unrelated to medical\nexpenses—does not help answer the question here: May a\nState condition Medicaid benefits on a beneficiary agree-\ning to define one-third of a tort recovery as reflecting\n“medical expenses”?\n   The Court recognizes that Ahlborn “had no occasion to\nresolve” the question “how to determine what portion of a\nsettlement represents payment for medical care,” ante, at\n5, but then promptly proceeds as if Ahlborn had done just\nthat. The Court quotes Ahlborn for the proposition that\na State may not claim any portion of a tort recovery\n“not ‘designated as payments for medical care,’ ” and then\nfaults North Carolina’s law because it “sets forth no pro-\ncess for determining what portion” is “attributable to med-\nical expenses.” Ante, at 6, 7 (quoting 547 U. S., at 284),\n7. Ahlborn spoke of “designated” amounts because, as\nnoted, there was a stipulated designation in that case.\nWhat to do when there is no such stipulation—when it’s\nnot clear “what portion of a settlement represents pay-\nment for medical care”—is a different question. The Court\nassumes the answer must be the same: that the settle-\nment must be parsed in every case, so that there is an\nactual, after-the-fact designation in every case. If the\nparties do not agree on one, as they did in Ahlborn, there\nmust be a process in place for reaching a case-specific\nattribution.\n   The nature of the “process” contemplated by the major-\nity is unclear, but it must involve an effort to determine\nwhat claims would have succeeded had there been a trial,\nwhat the damages would have been for the separate\nclaims, and so on—the very sort of inquiries settlement is\nintended to obviate. The Court talks of addressing these\n\f6                      WOS v. E. M. A.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nconcerns through “rebuttable presumptions and adjusted\nburdens of proof to ensure that speculative assessments of\na plaintiff ’s likely recovery do not defeat the State’s right\nto recover medical costs,” but ominously declines to give\nany assurance “that these rules are necessarily compliant\nwith the federal statute.” Ante, at 13.\n   Nothing in Ahlborn requires all this, and North Caro-\nlina has taken a different approach. It has adjusted its tort\nlaw to account for its obligations under federal Medicaid\nlaw by requiring that beneficiaries pay the State back in\nfull or designate one-third of any recovery as “medical ex-\npenses,” whichever is less. This approach allows bene-\nficiaries to obtain settlements, “meet[s] concerns about\nsettlement manipulation,” Ahlborn, supra, at 288, n. 18,\ncomplies with the statutory obligation that States make\nreasonable efforts to recover medical expenses from liable\nthird parties, and guarantees that the beneficiary will\nnever have to give back more than she has already re-\nceived from the State.\n   There’s nothing unusual about such an approach.\nStates define the contours of their own tort law all the\ntime, setting rules about who may recover in particular\ncircumstances, what claims may be alleged, which parties\nare liable, what defenses may be asserted, what damages\nare recoverable, and so on. Doing so does not amount to\nimposing a lien on any property to which an individual has\na vested right under state tort law. The Court says North\nCarolina cannot rely on its “traditional authority to regu-\nlate tort actions” because its rule in this case is not an\nexercise of its “general authority.” Ante, at 11. The Court\ncites no support for this vague new limitation on a State’s\npower to define tort remedies under state law, and I am\naware of none.\n   In fact, federal law says nothing about how States must\ndefine the recovery available to a Medicaid beneficiary\nsuing a third party. That silence is a good indication that\n\f                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                    ROBERTS, C.

In addition, the\nmajority’s hobgoblin is less frightening when we remem-\nber that North Carolina never takes back more than what\nit paid for such expenses.\n   The reasons for drawing a bright line, as North Carolina\nhas, are obvious and familiar. See generally Scalia, The\nRule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175\n(1989). Bright lines provide clear notice; here that means\nbeneficiaries know exactly where they stand with respect\nto reimbursing the State as they negotiate settlements\nwith third parties. Such clear rules are easy, cheap, and\nadministrable—laudable qualities in the context of a vast\nand intricate program. The Court’s approach, on the other\nend, requires the time of lawyers and judges, and that\ntime costs money—money better spent on providing health\ncare to the needy. Or so the State, responsible for admin-\nistering its program, could conclude, and nothing in the\nstatute, regulations, or our precedent says otherwise.\n   The majority points out that nearly one-third of the\nStates conduct hearings of the sort it contemplates. Ante,\nat 13. Good for them. The whole point of our federal\nsystem is that different States may reach different judg-\nments about how to run their own different programs.\nSuch flexibility is particularly important in this context,\nwhere Medicaid spending is the largest component of most\nstate budgets. The Court also notes that, in other areas,\ncourts have undertaken the work of “separat[ing] lump-\nsum settlements or jury awards into categories to satisfy\ndifferent claims.” Ibid. My point is not that the work\nrequired by the Court cannot be done—just that it has not\nbeen required by Congress or the Secretary.\n   On that note, it’s bad enough that the Court finds the\nState’s reasonable effort to reconcile its competing obliga-\ntions preempted. What is doubly unfortunate is that the\n\f                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCourt’s analysis necessarily implies that the Secretary’s\nhands are also tied. The Medicaid Act is Spending Clause\nlegislation, and such legislation is binding on States\nonly insofar as it is “unambiguous.” See Pennhurst State\nSchool and Hospital v.

It is also\nquite odd to suggest that the problem with North Caro-\nlina’s law would go away if only the State provided some\nsort of study substantiating the idea that one-third was a\ngood approximation in most cases.
