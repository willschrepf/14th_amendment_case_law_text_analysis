The primary question with which we must deal is the applicability of the Sherman Act to a politically motivated but economically tooled boycott participated in and organized by noncompetitors of those who suffered as a result of the boycott.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, the National Organization for Women, Inc., (NOW) organized a convention boycott against all states that had not ratified the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The impact was such that the Missouri motels and restaurants catering to the convention trade, and the Missouri economy as a whole, were suffering revenue losses.  Missouri asked for injunctive relief against NOW's activities under section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 26, which the district court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> denied.  The court, in a well-reasoned opinion, found, primarily on the basis that NOW's activities were political and thus not within the scope of the Sherman Act, that NOW had not violated section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1.  Missouri v. National Organization for Women, Inc., 467 F.Supp. 289 (W.D.Mo.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we hold that it was not the intent of Congress that the Sherman Act cover such activities, we affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

Scope of the Sherman Act</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Legislative History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court would be remiss if it did not acknowledge at the outset that the specific question this case presents has not been decided by the Supreme Court or, for that matter, by any other appellate court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  There is certainly language used by the Court in some of its cases that provides guidance, however, and the applicability of Noerr to the situation cannot be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question relevant to our inquiry is whether the intent of Congress was that the Sherman Act would cover activities such as NOW has undertaken in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 50th and 51st Congresses were primarily concerned with business trusts and the economic power which those trusts possessed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The trust concept involved the shareholders transferring their shares to a single trustee or board of trustees who would exercise complete control over the management of the trust; the shareholders received trust certificates which entitled them to a share of the profits of the trust.  Since the trust did not require state sanction, as did corporations, and since the trusts were not subject to the controls and restrictions that states could impose on corporations, they were more unwieldy than corporations.  1 E. Kintner, The Legislative History of the Federal Antitrust Laws and Related Statutes 10 (1978).  See generally id. at 8-13.  Public hostility towards the trusts in the late 1800's was immense and severe.  Id. at 11; Letwin, Congress and the Sherman Antitrust Law: 1887-1890, 23 U.Chi.L.Rev. 221, 235 (1956).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>Because a trust typically controlled the integrated levels of a particular industry, it could often control the means or sources of supply and dictate the prices or terms at which commodities would be bought, sold, or transported.  Moreover, large concerns often agreed to divide markets and to fix prices, engaged in predatory pricing, and discriminated in favor of certain entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 E. Kintner, supra at 11.  The kind of remedy that the public desired was a law to destroy the power of the trusts, Letwin, supra at 235, and such was the purpose of the Sherman Act.  But to limit the purpose to such a general one is misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, by prohibiting trusts, the Congress sought to achieve the preservation of free and fair competition.  See, e. g., 1 Kintner, supra at 113-18, quoting 21 Cong.Rec. 2456-58 (1890) (remarks of S. Sherman).  Unfortunately, an examination of the legislative history does not clearly indicate the answer to the question we have here whether Congress wanted to protect \"free and fair\" competition from political or social activities that can have the same effect upon competition as the commercial activities of a trust against a business.  See, i. e., Bird, Sherman Act Limitations on Noncommercial Concerted Refusals to Deal, 1970 Duke L.J. 247 (1970); Kestenbaum, The Antitrust Challenge to the Arab Boycott: Per Se Theory, Middle East Politics and United States v. Bechtel Corp., 54 Tex.L.Rev. 1411 (1976); Comment, 30 U.Chi.L.Rev. 171 (1962).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Missouri does not direct us to, nor have we discovered, any legislative history that indicates an affirmative intent of Congress to do so.  The few comments that we find that have some relevance to the question indicate otherwise.  For example, the following exchange took place between Senator Sherman, the sponsor of the Act, and Senator George, a major opponent of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. GEORGE.  Mr. President, this is a very important subject.  The bill undertakes to deal with very great evils which in the last few years have done great injury to the people of the United States.  I am in favor of legislation to prevent trusts and combinations, but I want effective legislation legislation that will crush out these combinations and trusts.  * * *.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have given some thought and some reflection to this matter, and I am extremely anxious that some bill shall receive the assent of this Congress which will put an end forever to the practice, now becoming too common, of large corporations, and of single persons, too, of large wealth, so arranging that they dictate to the people of this country what they shall pay when they purchase, and what they shall receive when they sell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have considered with some care the provisions of this bill.  I do not believe that the effect of its provisions is accurately understood by members of this body.  I propose, therefore, to make an analysis of its provisions to see, if we can, what it means, what evils it undertakes to remedy, and what remedy it provides, and how efficacious this remedy may prove to be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the beginning, I desire to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that the provisions of this bill are not confined to trusts, to combinations, to arrangements and agreements made between parties who are engaged in business; or, in other words, taking the language of the bill in its plain meaning, it refers to and brings within the punitory provisions of the fourth section not only arrangements and agreements between manufacturers, between sellers, between transporters, but it brings within its grasp arrangements made by any persons, though merely for moral and for defensive purposes.  The bill provides</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations made with a view, or which tend, to prevent full and free competition in the importation, transportation, or sale of articles imported into the United States shall be unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That would apply to an arrangement, to an agreement, to a combination, not of a business character, but, as I before remarked, to such as is purely moral and defensive.  It does not say that all arrangements, contracts, etc., made between persons and corporations engaged in selling, transporting, importing, manufacturing, or producing the articles described in the bill shall be unlawful; but it applies to all persons whether so engaged or not.  So if this bill passes as it now stands, the farmers and laborers of this country who are sending up their voices to the Congress of the United States, asking, pleading, imploring us to take action to put down trusts, these farmers and these laborers will find that they themselves in their most innocent and necessary arrangements, made solely for defensive purposes against the operations of these trusts, will be brought within the punitory provisions of this bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will strike the Senate probably with some astonishment if it be ascertained that under this bill the arrangements made by the Southern farmers during the last season to prevent the consummation of the robbery of them by the jute-bagging trust are made highly criminal.  Under it the farmers of the South who combine to prevent and defeat that most iniquitous and unjust combination will find that they themselves rather than the jute-bagging trust will be the subjects of severe punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the formation of this bagging trust the cotton farmers of the South, many of them in their granges and in their alliances, agreed that they would not purchase jute bagging, and by that agreement to a very large extent the rich rewards anticipated by the men who formed the trust were defeated.  These combinations tended to prevent full and free competition in the sale of this article.  But if that is not very clear, if Senators think these arrangements of the farmers did not have the effect of preventing this full and free competition, I call their attention to another provision contained in the third section of the bill, which reads in this way:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If acts shall be done under any such arrangement, contract, agreement, trust, or combination, which have for their purpose, or which shall tend to compel the giving up or sale of any lawful business, the person, partnership, or corporation injured thereby may sue for and recover in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction the damages sustained thereby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The very object of this combination of Southern farmers was to break down the trust in jute bagging, to compel the men who had seized and got control of the bagging manufacture of this country to give up their business to loose their grip upon the business of the farmers.  It also very clearly violated the other provision of the bill to which I have just called attention.  The fact that the bill does not restrict these combinations, these agreements, to persons engaged in trade, engaged in transportation, engaged in importation, engaged in selling the fact that it applies to all arrangements, all agreements, all combinations, by whomsoever made, would bring within its reach all defensive agreements made by farmers for the purpose of enhancing the price of their products.  This bill, instead of preventing trusts, would have the effect of crushing out all efforts of the people to rid themselves of their injurious effects.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. SHERMAN.  Do I understand my friend from Mississippi to claim that under this bill an agreement made by farmers not to buy cotton-bagging or not to buy anything else is a combination within the meaning of the act?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. GEORGE.  Yes, sir; directly within the meaning of the act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. SHERMAN.  That is a very extraordinary proposition.  There is nothing in the bill to prevent a refusal by anybody to buy anything.  All that it says is that the people producing or selling a particular article shall not make combinations to advance the price of the necessaries of life.

But yet that is the legal meaning and force of the bill; and I will state to the Senate and to the Senator from Ohio that it is directly within the terms of this bill to forbid any number of persons belonging to or joining a temperance society whose object is to compel retailers of intoxicating liquors to give up their business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. SHERMAN.

The Senator, as I understand, now claims that an agreement among several people not to drink whisky or brandy is in restraint of the trade of selling whisky or brandy and is therefore a combination within the meaning of this bill?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. GEORGE.  I insist that a society, making an agreement or a combination between citizens of a town anywhere in the Union not to drink, not to use in any way vinous or spirituous liquors, and to persuade others to a similar abstention, does, in the language of this bill, tend to compel persons engaged in retailing liquor in that community to give up their business, and the doing of that is expressly condemned by the third section of this bill.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. (WILLIAM M.)

Where does the Senator propose his amendment to come in?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. WILSON, of Iowa.  I propose it as an addition to the proviso of section 1, and it is simply for the purpose of avoiding an effect which is likely to flow from the earlier provisions of that section.  That section provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between two or more persons or corporations, or both, made with a view or which tend to prevent full and free competition in the importation, transportation, or sale of articles imported into the United States, or with a view or which tend to prevent full and free competition in articles of growth, production, or manufacture of any State or Territory of the United States with similar articles of the growth, production, or manufacture of any other State or Territory, or in the transportation or sale of like articles, the production of any State or Territory of the United States, into or within any other State or Territory of the United States: and all arrangements, trusts, or combinations between such persons or corporations made with a view or which tend to advance the cost to the consumer of any such articles are hereby declared to be against public policy, unlawful, and void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will state frankly my purpose in offering the amendment.  Under the provisions of this section, should it become a law, every organization in such a State as Iowa, for instance, of the character of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Temperance Alliance, and other organizations intended to promote the execution of the laws of that State in respect of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors would become illegal bodies and their movements subject to the terms and provisions of this bill.  I know that was not intended, and yet the language, without being stripped of its power by the amendment I propose, would include all organizations of that kind.  All I ask is that the subjects within the police power of the States as embraced within that legislation, of Iowa and any other State which may desire similar legislation, shall not be embraced within this provision, but that the States shall be left free in the execution of their police powers.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will just add to what I have said that the proviso to which I offered this as an amendment excepts from the operations of this section of the bill arrangements, agreements, or combinations between laborers, made with a view of lessening the number of hours of their labor or of increasing their wages, and it also excepts arrangements, agreements, associations, or combinations among persons engaged in horticulture or agriculture, made with a view of enhancing the price of their own agricultural or horticultural products.  I think that the exception which I ask to have made by this amendment is quite as worthy of the support of the Senate as either of these.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. HOAR.  Allow me to ask the Senator if his amendment accomplishes his object.  I understand his object is to protect combinations of persons intended to discourage the use and manufacture of intoxicating liquors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. WILSON, of Iowa.  My object is to exclude them from the operation of the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. HOAR.  I understand, to protect them from being affected by it.  But the only description in his amendment is of such associations as are in aid of the execution of the laws of a State in pursuance of its police power.  Now, if this bill without his amendment would render the class of persons he has described subject to the penal provision, all temperance societies whose object is to persuade mankind not to use intoxicating liquors would still remain in spite of his amendment within the purview of the bill.  It seems to me he should extend his amendment a little further, because, as far as my State goes, this class of associations which he has described do not confine their efforts to the execution of the law, but their efforts are a great deal more extensive and extend to discouraging the use or manufacture of intoxicating liquors altogether.  This is what he means, and we would all vote for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. WILSON, of Iowa.  I am satisfied that my amendment will cover the purpose I have in view concerning my State.  If other Senators desire something further in regard to their States, they can move it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. HOAR.  I move to amend the Senator's amendment by adding to it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Or to discourage the use or manufacture of intoxicating liquors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And we will take a vote on that.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRESIDING OFFICER.  The question is on agreeing to the amendment to the amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. SHERMAN.  The Senator from Iowa showed me his amendment.  As these organizations in Iowa are associated and organized something in the nature of a corporation, there might be some reason for believing that they possibly might fall within the meaning of the clauses of the bill.  Therefore, I have no objection to his amendment, but I do not see any reason for putting in temperance societies any more than churches or school-houses or any other kind of moral or educational associations that may be organized.  Such an association is not in any sense a combination or arrangement made to interfere with interstate commerce; but under the peculiar circumstances, upon the facts stated by the Senator from Iowa, I think it is very proper to make an exception of those organizations in Iowa which are really in aid of the execution of State law.  I would apply it to all organizations which are using either moral or any other kind of means for the enforcement of local laws; but I do not think it is worth while to adopt the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts, because that would include temperance societies.  You might as well include churches and Sunday schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 250-52, quoting 21 Cong.Rec. 2658-59 (1890).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the exchanges reveal, the conversation provides an indication we do not set it out to show an affirmative statement of intent.  Yet, the indication is that it was the competitors in commerce that Senator Sherman had in mind as the concern of his bill, not noncompetitors motivated socially or politically in connection with legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the legislative history of the Sherman Act does not reveal that Congress intended to prohibit, with the Sherman Act, activities such as NOW's boycott; this is not inconsistent with the Supreme Court cases considering similar questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Case Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court in this case stated from the bench, \"this is a unique case.  It is different from any case in the law books anywhere.  There simply has never been another one like it.\"  Consequently, and as we noted earlier, the question of whether NOW's specific sort of activities an economic boycott, politically motivated, to achieve a legislative goal was intended by Congress to be within the scope of the Sherman Act, has not been specifically addressed by the Supreme Court.  We can, however, find guidance in several of the Court's opinions by noting a complete lack of an affirmative indication that such activities are covered, by taking cognizance of the Court's passing references that indicate that the activities that were meant to be covered are competitive activities by competitors with some self-enhancement motivation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and by a thorough analysis of Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the early, but still timely, Supreme Court discussions of the legislative history of the Sherman Act is found in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S.Ct. 307, 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943) wherein the Court ruled that the scope of the Sherman Act did not extend to state action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of its discussion, the Court draws conclusions \"not from the literal meaning of the words\" of the Act, but from \"the purpose, the subject matter, the context and the legislative history of the statute.\"  Id. at 351, 63 S.Ct. at 313.  As the Court noted in National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 687, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 1362, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978), the Sherman Act cannot mean what it says.  It was the legislative history upon which the Parker Court relied the fact that \"(t)here is no suggestion of a purpose to restrain state action in the Act's legislative history\" in making its determination that the California raisin pro-rate program was not within the scope of the Sherman Act.  Parker v. Brown, supra, 317 U.S. at 351, 63 S.Ct. at 313.  Of particular importance to the Court's discussion was the fact that an unexpressed congressional purpose to nullify or restrain a state's control over its officers and agents should not be lightly attributed to Congress via the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, an infringement upon the people's right to petition the government by a boycott should also not be lightly attributed to Congress.  We perceive a more accurate phrasing of Congress' concern to be not the elimination of boycotts, but elimination of boycotts used by a competitor against a competitor (or against a supplier, customer, etc.) in the business of competing.  For example, in the legislative history to which the Court makes reference in Parker v. Brown, supra, 317 U.S. at 351, 63 S.Ct. at 313, 21 Cong.Rec. 2562 (1890), Senator Sherman states that the Act is meant to apply to \"business combinations,\" not to \"voluntary associations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959), one of the primary boycott cases considered by the Supreme Court, the Court held that the Sherman Act was meant to cover what the district court had found to be a \"purely private quarrel.\"  In the course of its explanation, the Court discusses the boycott in terms of a business activity amongst competitors.  Id. at 210-13, 79 S.Ct. at 708-710.  The Court also criticizes the court of appeals for its heavy reliance on Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S.Ct. 982, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1940) and in considering the lack of significant effect on the market as relevant in not finding a violation.  While noting that there is some strong language in Apex that indicates section one Sherman Act violations must include an effect on market prices, the Court emphasizes that the defendant in Apex was a labor union and that part of the basis for the Apex decision was a recognition that the Sherman Act \"is aimed primarily at combinations having commercial objectives and is applied only to a very limited extent to organizations, like labor unions, which normally have other objectives.\"  Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., supra, 359 U.S. at 213 n.7, 79 S.Ct. at 710.  While the statement was not necessary to the outcome of the case, the Court's decision in Klor's includes a signal that the focus of the Sherman Act is upon commercial-business activities, and that the organization and objectives involved can make a difference in the application of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, at a minimum, in Parker, the Court tells us that the Sherman Act does not mean exactly what it says, i. e., \"all combinations in restraint of trade,\" and that the Act must be interpreted with the setting in which it was enacted; in Klor's, even when considering the impact of a boycott, the Court does not use overly broad language in holding that the Sherman Act covers such activity.  Instead, the Court focuses upon the business nature of the boycott, the intent of the Act to cover \"business combinations with commercial objectives,\" and concludes that the boycott is within the scope of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other cases considered by the Supreme Court help define the scope of the Sherman Act, and in a passive manner, limit the Act to apply to commercial activities, as opposed to social or political activities.  See, e. g., Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra (narrowing the scope of the Act in regard to union activities) and United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, 322 U.S. 533, 553, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 1174, 88 L.Ed. 1440 (1944) (the Act does apply to insurance companies \"every person engaged in business whose activities might restrain or monopolize commercial intercourse among the states.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first Supreme Court case, however, that actively deals with the type of conflict we have in the present case, is Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra.  Although the factual situation in Noerr differs from that of this case, sufficiently that we must specifically address those distinctions the overriding policy implications of Noerr are persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Noerr, the defendant railroads had engaged in a publicity campaign with the purpose of fostering the adoption and retention of laws that would be destructive of the trucking business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basically, the Supreme Court held that the railroads' campaign to get the legislature to pass laws, no matter how unethical that campaign was, was not within the scope of the Sherman Act.  The Court said, inter alia, \"no violation of the Act can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws.\"  Id. 365 U.S. at 135, 81 S.Ct. at 528.  Even this strict ruling sheds some light on the instant case inasmuch as NOW's boycott was stipulated to be an attempt to influence ratification by the Missouri legislature of the proposed ERA.  State of Missouri v. National Organization for Women, Inc., supra, 467 F.Supp. at 293.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also demands that we deal with the first factual distinction between Noerr and our case, and that is the subject matter of the legislation.  The legislation in Noerr directly concerned the alleged violators of the Sherman Act and the target of the alleged violation, the railroads and the truckers.  The parties were intimately affected by and concerned with the legislation as the legislation would either directly hurt or help them \"financially,\" \"economically,\" and \"commercially.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ERA is not a \"financial,\" \"economic,\" or \"commercial\" piece of legislation.  It is a social or political piece of legislation.  While it is obviously perceived by the members of NOW as beneficial, the record indicates, and it seems apparent, that the orientation of both parties, NOW and Missouri, to the ERA is not one of profit motivation.  The only financial, economic or commercial matter involved here is Missouri's concern about the financial repercussion of the boycott.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keeping in mind that what we are discussing is the applicability of the Sherman Act to the facts, and the intent of the Congress to cover such situations, the difference in the content of the legislation if anything makes it more clear that NOW's efforts to influence the legislature's action on the ERA are beyond the scope and intent of the Sherman Act.  A social piece of legislation and the efforts involved in influencing the legislature's actions on such legislation is further afield from the central focus of the Sherman Act than a commercial piece of legislation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the petitioning efforts associated therewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, considered in isolation, the subject matter of the ERA is not helpful to Missouri's arguments.  Missouri, however, argues the relevancy of the distinction in connection with its \"secondary boycott\" theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Missouri refers to NOW's activities as a secondary boycott and argues that the district court, in not specifically finding that there was a secondary boycott, erred in its factual findings.  Missouri argues that the error taints the district court's other findings and its analysis of the legal issues.  The only clue as to exactly how this taint distorts the district court's findings is Missouri's claim that it affected the court's statement that if this \"were not a legitimate effort to influence the legislature, this Court would be presented with a different case.\"  Missouri v. National Organization for Women, Inc., supra, 467 F.Supp. at 306 (emphasis added by Missouri in its brief).  Missouri appears to equate legitimate efforts to influence a legislature with ethical or non-harmful efforts to influence the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court establishes the fallacy of this equation in Noerr.  In its discussion of the railroad's publicity campaign used to influence the legislature which, besides being unethical and harmful, was characterized as deceptive and vicious, the Court noted that the campaign was intended to and did injure the truckers in their relationship with their customers.  But</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p>(i)nsofar as that Act sets up a code of ethics at all, it is a code that condemns trade restraints, not political activity, and, as we have already pointed out, a publicity campaign to influence governmental action falls clearly into the category of political activity.  The proscriptions of the Act, tailored as they are for the business world, are not at all appropriate for application in the political arena.  Congress has traditionally exercised extreme caution in legislating with respect to problems relating to the conduct of political activities, a caution which has been reflected in the decisions of this Court interpreting such legislation.  All of this caution would go for naught if we permitted an extension of the Sherman Act to regulate activities of that nature simply because those activities have a commercial impact and involve conduct that can be termed unethical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 140-41, 81 S.Ct. at 531 (footnote omitted).  The boycott in this case had a commercial impact and has been called unethical.  But it is political activity aimed at persuading the legislature to take action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Missouri also claims that the existence of the boycott takes this case out of the scope of Noerr, in that the boycott does not fit within Noerr's controlling principle that Sherman Act violations cannot be predicated upon \"mere attempts\" to influence the passage of laws.  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 135, 81 S.Ct. at 528.  The boycott, Missouri argues, makes NOW's activities more than a \"mere attempt.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming this to be accurate, one need not go further than the Noerr case to determine what controls when there is more than a mere attempt.  The Noerr Court initially discusses the three considerations which lead to the Court's conclusion that activities which are comprised of mere solicitation of governmental action with respect to the passage of laws are not violative of the Sherman Act.  Those are (1) the essential dissimilarity between an agreement to jointly seek legislation and the agreements traditionally condemned by the Sherman Act; (2) that such a holding would have the effect of recognizing that the government has the power to act in a representative capacity in refusing the people the right to freely inform the government of their wishes; and (3) generally, but \"of at least equal significance, such a construction of the Sherman Act would raise important constitutional questions.\"  Id. at 137-38, 81 S.Ct. at 529-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the Court then went on to consider, as a separate issue, whether the publicity campaign and the techniques used, including the much-discussed \"third-party technique,\" would take the railroad's actions out of the controlling principle discussed in regard to the mere solicitation of the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enlightening as to what this so-called third-party technique is the Noerr district court's discussion of it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p>One of the objectives was the enactment of legislation, not under the sponsorship of the railroads but by others acting on their behalf, by what was called in inoffensive and pleasing language, \"The third-party technique.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * * It was also determined that the campaign should be handled through an independent public relations firm.  A number of public relations firms were interviewed and of the four or five selected for interview, all were leaders in that particular field.  It may be noted in passing that of those interviewed and who submitted proposals, about which proposals testimony was given at the trial, each and every one of the suggested programs provided for a campaign of publicity to put the truckers in a bad light with the public; to encourage normal public resentment of the motoring public to the operation of big trucks on the highways; to secure the assistance of organizations which were apparently \"independent and public spirited\" in the campaign against the truckers, and to create a demand for legislation penalizing the truckers either by limitation of size and weight or the imposition of user taxes which would make their operation unprofitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noerr Motor Freight, Inc. v. Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference, 155 F.Supp. 768, 778 (E.D.Pa.1957) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The organization selected by the railroad to handle the campaign was the Byoir Firm:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p>The understanding of the Byoir organization as to its duties in connection with the campaign (was) entitled \"The Objectives\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the ultimate objective is shrewdly set forth as legislation affecting the truckers, the intermediate goals are also set forth, all designed and aimed at injury to the truckers.  These objectives, including the crystallization of motorist resentment arising from commercial heavy truck operations over the roads, were designed to arouse the public generally of the need to obtain new methods of financing public highways and by methods which would not appear to emanate from railroad sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 778-79 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, an additional factor in Noerr that which was more than mere solicitation was the railroads' third-party technique; further, part of the public relations firm's job was to \"create a demand for legislation\" by creating public resentment of the trucks.  Finally, similar to NOW's goals, the railroad had an ultimate objective the legislation and an intermediate goal injury to the truckers.  In the NOW case, the ultimate objective is legislation, and the intermediate goal is inflicting economic injury with the hope of achieving that ultimate objective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In direct response to the use of the third-party technique, the Noerr Court emphasized that the Sherman Act condemns trade restraints and not political activity.  The Supreme Court discussed the \"publicity campaign\" (pseudonym for the third-party technique and the intermediate goal of inflicting injury) as falling clearly within the category of political activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"additional factors\" that took the railroad in Noerr beyond mere solicitation did not include a boycott.  And the Court in Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., supra, very pointedly made clear that boycotts are destructive, very possibly more destructive than the third-party technique.  Yet, at the bottom line, the Noerr \"additional factors\" and the additional factors in this case cannot be analytically distinguished insofar as it is relevant to the applicability of the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the Noerr Court noted that there were no specific findings that the railroads attempted directly to persuade anyone not to deal with the truckers.  Here, NOW did attempt and did succeed in persuading others who were \"customers\" of the State of Missouri not to deal with Missouri.  However, the crux of the issue is that NOW was politically motivated to use a boycott to influence ratification of the ERA.  In our case, as in Noerr, the publicity campaign was not a mere sham to cover up an attempt to interfere with the business relationship of a competitor.  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 144, 81 S.Ct. at 533.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, notwithstanding the superficial impact of the Noerr Court's statement that the railroads never directly tried to stop customers from dealing with truckers, and the inherent conflict that the boycott in this case creates with that statement, the distinction is that the NOW boycott is a tool, not just a competitive purpose, just as the \"publicity campaign/third-party technique\" in Noerr was a tool.  The results of the tools are the same.  The facts demonstrate the similarity.  In Noerr,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p>(c)irculars, speeches, newspaper articles, editorials, magazine articles, memoranda and all other documents discuss in one way or another the railroads' charges that heavy trucks injure the roads, violate the laws and create traffic hazards, and urge that truckers should be forced to pay a fair share of the costs of rebuilding the roads, that they should be compelled to obey the laws, and that limits should be placed upon the weight of the loads they are permitted to carry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 142-43, 81 S.Ct. at 532.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, NOW's concerted activities and publicity campaign were initiated to show that in not ratifying the ERA, Missouri was denying rights to women, and in order to show displeasure with Missouri and to show support for the ERA, organizations were urged by NOW not to hold their conventions in Missouri.  The ultimate goal was to have the ERA ratified and the hope was that by boycotting the state for as long as the ERA remained unratified in that state, it would result in a favorable legislative vote.  State of Missouri v. National Organization for Women, Inc., supra, 467 F.Supp. at 292.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that there were active solicitations by NOW followed by a boycott decision by the recipients of the solicitation.  Id. at 295.  And yet, borrowing from the Supreme Court's language in Noerr, the finding by the district court in the instant case that NOW's campaign was intended to and did in fact injure Missouri in its relationship with its convention customers can mean no more than that Missouri sustained a direct injury as an incidental effect of NOW's campaign to influence governmental action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p>It is inevitable, whenever an attempt is made to influence legislation by a campaign of publicity, (<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> that an incidental effect of that campaign may be the infliction of some direct injury upon the interests of the party against whom the campaign is directed.  * * *  To hold that the knowing infliction of such injury renders the campaign itself illegal would thus be tantamount to outlawing all such campaigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 143-44, 81 S.Ct. at 533.  NOW appears to have utilized its political power to bring about the ratification of the ERA by the State of Missouri.  The tool it chose was a boycott, a device economic by nature.  However, using a boycott in a non-competitive political arena for the purpose of influencing legislation is not proscribed by the Sherman Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, while we do not pretend that Noerr disposes of all the questions in this case, we additionally do not feel that the distinctions discussed above, notably, the use of a boycott and the injury of a noncompetitor (Missouri) by a noncompetitor (NOW), are relevant to the applicability of the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There resulted a restraint of trade in the Noerr case just as has occurred in this case.  In Noerr it was accomplished by means of a publicity campaign with the ultimate goal of obtaining legislation that commercially or competitively affected the competitor-campaigners and competitor-target.  In the instant case, it was accomplished by means of a publicity-boycott campaign with the ultimate goal of obtaining socially or politically-oriented legislation that had no effect upon the campaigners or target, at least in a commercial or business sense.  These distinctions are not where our focus should be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the focus should be on the overriding consideration in Noerr, the legislative intent concerning the scope of the Sherman Act.  And Noerr deals with this in a strong fashion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p>Inherent in such fights (as occurred in the Noerr case), which are commonplace in the halls of legislative bodies, is the possibility, and in many instances even the probability, that one group or the other will get hurt by the arguments that are made.  In this particular instance, each group appears to have utilized all the political powers it could muster in an attempt to bring about the passage of laws that would help it or injure the other.  But the contest itself appears to have been conducted along lines normally accepted in our political system * * *.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 144-45, 81 S.Ct. at 533.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Mo.Stat.Ann. &#167; 416.141 (Vernon 1979) provides: \"Sections 416.011 to 416.161 shall be construed in harmony with ruling judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes.\"  Thus we hold that, just as there is no cause of action under section one of the Sherman Act, there is no cause of action under Mo.Stat.Ann. &#167; 416.031.1 (Vernon 1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final theory under which Missouri brings its lawsuit against NOW is a state common law tort claim of intentional infliction of harm without legal excuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Restatement Second of Torts &#167; 766B (1977) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p>One who intentionally and improperly interferes with another's prospective contractual relation (except a contract to marry) is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary harm resulting from loss of the benefits of the relation, whether the interference consists of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) inducing or otherwise causing a third person not to enter into or continue the prospective relation or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) preventing the other from acquiring or continuing the prospective relation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factors to be considered in determining whether the interference is improper are listed in the Restatement Second of Torts &#167; 767 (1977):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p>In determining whether an actor's conduct in intentionally interfering with a contract or a prospective contractual relation of another is improper or not, consideration is given to the following factors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) the nature of the actor's conduct,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) the actor's motive,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) the interests of the other with which the actor's conduct interferes,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor's conduct to the interference and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(g) the relations between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find, as the district court found, that the discussion and analysis of the court in Sierra Club v. Butz, 349 F.Supp. 934 (N.D.Cal.1972) is applicable to the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are distinguishable; Sierra Club involved (1) asserting administrative appeals, (2) filing a complaint in federal court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, and (3) making other complaints and arguments to the United States Forest Service urging action by the governmental agency.  Additionally, there was no boycott involved in Sierra Club.  But, for the same reasons given in our discussion of the distinctions between Noerr and the immediate case, we find these distinctions irrelevant.  Further, California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972) establishes the Noerr doctrine applicability to petitioning of courts and administrative agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sierra Club, plaintiff had moved that the defendant's counterclaims be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  The counterclaims contained two counts, both based on state law tort liability for interference with advantageous relationships.  The basis of the defense against the counterclaims was the First Amendment provision guaranteeing the right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  The court concluded that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p>liability can be imposed for activities ostensibly consisting of petitioning the government for redress of grievances only if the petitioning is a \"sham,\" and the real purpose is not to obtain governmental action, but to otherwise injure the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sierra Club v.

However, many of the cases do focus on the Noerr Court's reliance on the right of petition and the important constitutional questions that would be raised should the Court impute to Congress via the Sherman Act an intent to cover the Noerr activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 138-39, 81 S.Ct. at 530.

Trucking Unlimited, supra, was the one that dealt with it in the most expanded manner.  In Motor Transport, Justice Douglas stated that the Noerr decision rested upon two grounds: (1) that there was no basis in the Sherman Act's legislative history by which to impute a purpose to regulate political activity and (2) that \"(t)he right of petition is one of the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, and we cannot, of course, lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these freedoms.\"  Id. 404 U.S. at 510, 92 S.Ct. at 611, quoting Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 138, 81 S.Ct. at 530.  After stating this, the Court then extended the Noerr philosophy to the use of the channels and procedures of state and federal agencies and courts on the basis that not to do so would be destructive of the rights of association and of petition.  Id., 404 U.S. at 510, 92 S.Ct. at 611.  More importantly, in the course of invoking the sham exception to the Noerr case, the Court's focus is on the First Amendment rights, id. at 510-516, 92 S.Ct. at 611-614; \"First Amendment rights may not be used as the means or the pretext for achieving 'substantive evils' * * * which the legislature has the power to control.\"  Id. at 515, 92 S.Ct. at 614, quoting NAACP v. Button, supra, 371 U.S. at 444, 83 S.Ct. at 343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not even argue that there is a sham in this case; indeed, Missouri specifically argues that even those residents of Missouri who support the ERA must suffer as a result of this boycott.  Thus the central point in California Motor and the other cases citing Noerr is the shift in focus from the Noerr holding that the railroads' activities are beyond the intent of Congress, insofar as the Sherman Act is concerned, to the Noerr statement that there are serious constitutional questions involved also.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court continued its mention of the constitutional issue presented in Noerr in Lafayette v.

Bellotti, supra, 435 U.S. at 792 n.31, 98 S.Ct. at 1424 n.31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lafayette, the Court stated that only two policies have been held to be \"sufficiently weighty to override the presumption against implied exclusions from coverage of the antitrust laws\" one of which was the Noerr doctrine.  (The other was the Parker state action exemption.)  Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., supra, 435 U.S. at 399, 98 S.Ct. at 1129.  \"(A) contrary construction (in Noerr ) would impede the open communication between the polity and its lawmakers which is vital to the functioning of a representative democracy.  * * *  '(A)nd of at least equal significance,' is the threat to the constitutionally protected right of petition which a contrary construction would entail.\"  Id., quoting Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.

Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961), concluded that the NOW boycott would fall outside the scope of the Sherman Act.  The court observed that since the convention boycott took place in essentially a political context, and could be characterized as \"noncommercial\" and \"noneconomic,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> the \"essential dissimilarity\" between the convention boycott and those agreements traditionally held violative of section 1 of the Sherman Act was greater in this case than in Noerr.  Thus, the holding in Noerr was considered dispositive of the applicability of the Sherman Act to the NOW boycott.  I believe that this is an over-broad interpretation of the Noerr case and ignores the basic factual difference between Noerr and the present situation of an economic boycott.  Most significantly, the District Court practically ignored the critical issue in dispute by merely assuming, without any analysis, that NOW's actions were themselves \"an exercise of first amendment rights.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>  The majority opinion follows this same course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with any exercise of statutory construction, our first duty is to look to the language of the statute itself.

The comprehensiveness of the Sherman Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> has been noted frequently.  E. g., City of Lafayette v.

City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., supra, 435 U.S. at 399, 98 S.Ct. at 1129.  The court has recognized only two categories of exclusions, the Parker v. Brown state action exclusion and the Noerr exclusion, and has stated that even where the fundamental policies underlying these exclusions are implicated, antitrust enforcement will not be precluded unless it would severely impinge upon fundamental policies.  The Court explained: \"Congress, exercising the full extent of its constitutional power, sought to establish a regime of competition as the fundamental principle governing commerce in this country.\"  435 U.S. at 398, 98 S.Ct. at 1129 (footnotes omitted).  See also California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 100 S.Ct. 937, 944, 62 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980).  The Court elucidated the fundamental and overarching policies of the antitrust laws by emphasizing the purpose to eradicate \"the potential of serious distortion of the rational and efficient allocation of resources, and the efficiency of free markets which the regime of competition embodied in the antitrust laws is thought to engender,\" 435 U.S. at 408, 98 S.Ct. at 1134 (footnote omitted), and observed that economic choices counselled solely by parochial interests without regard to their anticompetitive effects would introduce a serious chink in the armor of antitrust protection and be at odds with the comprehensive national policy established by Congress to promote free market competition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a>  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lafayette, the Court explained the Noerr decision on the basis that a contrary construction would have been a threat to the constitutionally protected right of petition, and would impede the open communication between the polity and its lawmakers which is vital to the functioning of a representative democracy.  435 U.S. at 399, 98 S.Ct. at 1129.  In order to show an exclusion from antitrust enforcement, the Court stated that it is necessary to demonstrate \"countervailing policies which are sufficiently weighty to overcome the presumption.\"  435 U.S. at 400, 98 S.Ct. at 1130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority does not directly address Missouri's arguments on appeal but rather, through a generalized study, seeks to show that the District Court was correct in concluding that the NOW boycott falls outside the scope of the Sherman Act.  The majority's analysis, however, inadequately balances the competing interests.  An appropriate analysis of the issue in this case requires careful consideration of whether the convention boycott constitutes constitutionally protected activity under the first amendment; otherwise it must fall within the proscriptions of the antitrust laws as an obvious concerted action to restrain trade and inflict economic harm.  Both the District Court and the majority appear to have resolved this issue simply on the basis that NOW's motivation in instituting the boycott was to influence ratification by the Missouri Legislature of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).  This resolution insufficiently addresses the critical balancing necessary because it virtually ignores the anticompetitive and disruptive effect of the adverse economic impact of NOW's conduct and fails to acknowledge government's legitimate interest in protecting and regulating interstate commerce<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> and in maintaining a competitive economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority apparently acknowledges that a political boycott can have the same effect upon competition as a commercial boycott, and also recognizes that the legislative history of the Sherman Act does not provide an answer to the question of whether Congress intended to protect competition from the adverse effects of politically motivated economic restraints.  Ante at 1305.  The majority's review of the legislative history merely reveals an absence of any stated affirmative intent to provide coverage.  Their review of case law similarly simply led to a conclusion that there was a lack of an affirmative indication that politically motivated, economic boycotts are covered by the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a>  Ante at 1309.  Without greater support, NOW's exclusion defense must surely be rejected in view of the presumption against implied exclusions, City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., supra, 435 U.S. at 399, 98 S.Ct. at 1129, and the comprehensive language of the Act, the literal terms of which clearly encompass NOW's activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the majority returns to Noerr for guidance and concludes that because NOW's conduct was motivated by the purpose of influencing the passage of legislation, the conduct implicated the right to petition government for redress of grievances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a> raising important constitutional questions, and was essentially dissimilar to conduct traditionally condemned by the Sherman Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> and that therefore NOW's conduct falls without the bounds of antitrust regulation.  Unfortunately, the majority does not directly address the important constitutional questions raised, finding that their simple emergence suffices to resolve the question of antitrust coverage.  Furthermore, the majority deems \"superficial\" the Noerr Court's clear attempt to distinguish the railroads' publicity campaign from the situation of a direct concerted refusal to deal, Noerr, supra, 365 U.S. at 136, 81 S.Ct. at 528.  Ante at 1314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the majority finds that \"the crux of the issue is that NOW was politically motivated to use a boycott,\" ante at 1314, Missouri contends that the focus must be upon the use of the boycott, not its motivation, because the antitrust laws are designed to protect against the anticompetitive effect of restraints of trade inherent in a boycott, regardless of its motivation.  Although the majority seeks to dismiss this effect by characterizing it as \"incidental\" and portraying the context of the boycott as a \"noncompetitive political arena,\" ante at 1315, the congressional intent to preserve and foster free market competition cannot be summarily dismissed or ignored.  The arena may not be economically competitive with regard to NOW, and NOW may not have economic interests at stake in this controversy, but the boycott severely affects the competitive posture of Missouri convention interests and the overall economic welfare of Missouri residents.  Thus, the technical characterization of the boycott as noncommercial and noneconomic is misleading<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a> and actually erroneous in important respects.  The anticompetitive economic and commercial effects of the boycott on Missouri's legitimate business interests and welfare are identical, regardless of whether the motivation for the boycott is political or economic.  The majority thus places the court's imprimatur upon a boycott with potentially severe economic and commercial consequences simply on the basis of the boycott's motivation.  The precedential support for drawing this distinction is tenuous at best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority explicitly states: \"(W)e do not rest our decision in this case upon the basis that the boycott was noncommercial and non-economic.  Our decision is based upon the right to use political activities to petition the government, as was the underlying factor in Noerr.\"  Ante at 1315, n.16.  The majority holding is thus conceived as supported or commanded by the Noerr decision.  Noerr held that concerted publicity to influence favorable legislative activity harmful in some respects to others was protected by the first amendment and not violative of the antitrust laws.  It dealt with the situation of a publicity campaign to influence legislative action; there was no refusal to deal in Noerr, nor was any economic boycott involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at issue is considerably different.  As Missouri succinctly states: \"The Noerr case was a combination to get legislation harmful to others.  The NOW case is a combination to harm others to get legislation * * *.\"  Unlike the infliction of some direct injury in Noerr, the direct economic injury to Missouri is not an incidental effect of the tool used to influence government action; the injury itself constitutes the tool used.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a>  Unlike the pure publicity campaign of Noerr, NOW went beyond providing the public and legislators with information (however reliable), and actively induced and combined with others<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> to boycott a specific, identifiable segment of a highly competitive industry, the convention industry in states that had not ratified the ERA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These factual distinctions between Noerr and the case at bar mandate that the court in this case undertake a more comprehensive balancing of the important governmental interest in preserving the free enterprise system with the interest of people to use this particular method of influencing legislation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a>  Noerr simply does not imply the conclusion that the first amendment immunizes politically motivated boycotts against antitrust attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a>  This brings us back to the crucial question of whether, upon balancing the first amendment interests of NOW with the substantial and important governmental interests embodied in the antitrust laws, the politically motivated economic boycott falls within the ambit of the antitrust laws or is constitutionally protected by the first amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This formulation of the critical issue involved herein leads the court into the delicate and complicated area of first amendment law concerning communicative conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a>  While I can well appreciate the majority's reluctance to attack these sensitive issues, I feel it is necessary to assure consistent evaluation of similar claims<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1\" id=\"fn17-1_ref\">17</a> and to bring forth all of the factual findings that are relevant to a thorough consideration of each claim.  As a single member of the court I hesitate to arrogate to myself the role of endorsing a particular scheme of analysis.  Because of the District Court's failure to address the constitutional issue and its failure to accord significant weight to important and substantial governmental interests, I would remand to the District Court with instructions to make further factual findings and apply a balancing analysis to the first amendment issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found as a matter of fact that the activities of NOW would be encompassed within the meaning of the terms \"combination or conspiracy\" of section 1 of the Sherman Act.  467 F.Supp. at 296.  The evidence here conclusively supports this finding, as NOW admittedly induced and solicited the support of other groups.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-1\" id=\"fn18-1_ref\">18</a>  The court below, however, investigated the extent of economic harm that would flow from this concerted refusal to deal only in relation to the issue of standing.  It never undertook to balance the disruptive effect upon free market competition with the asserted first amendment rights, even though the potential economic and competitive injury that can flow from a particular practice is clearly relevant to an evaluation of the importance of the governmental interest in regulating that practice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  See note 8 supra.  When the interference with first amendment rights is minimal and the governmental interest in regulation is great, the mere presence of some first amendment interest cannot prevent the federal government from exercising its constitutionally granted power to regulate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The potential chill factor that arises in situations involving first amendment rights, see Bates v.

Additionally, Klor's has been interpreted as standing for the proposition that boycotts are illegal per se.  Handler, Recent Developments in Antitrust Law: 1958-1959, 59 Colum.L.Rev. 840, 862 (1959).  However, even in the portion of its opinion in Klor's where the Court addresses the crippling effects of boycotts, the Court focuses upon \"(g)roup boycotts, or concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders * * *.\"  Klor's, Inc. v.

Missouri paints the picture thus: NOW is withholding all convention business from the Holiday-Johnson Motel (HJM) until HJM goes to its legislator and convinces its legislator to vote for the ratification of the proposed ERA.  This characterization of the facts portrays HJM as the target of NOW's boycott.  The target of the boycott was not HJM; it was the State of Missouri.  It was the State of Missouri which suffered financial loss and which had standing to sue, not \"to prosecute purely personal claims of its citizens, * * * but * * * to protect the public interest.\"  Missouri v. NOW, supra, 467 F.Supp. at 301, quoting Kelley v. Carr, 442 F.Supp. 346, 357 (W.D.Mich.1977).  Further, the facts clearly reveal, and the district court so found, that there were no punitive intentions involved in the boycott insofar as punishment for Missouri's past failure to ratify the ERA was concerned</p>\n        <p>We find Missouri's focus on the facts of this case and not the the district court's misleading.  The district court's view is more appropriate for the issues at hand.  NOW's boycott was directed against states that had yet to ratify the proposed ERA.  NOW was aware that such a boycott would work against the public's economic interests; NOW was hopeful that the public's interest would suffer to the extent that the public would be persuaded that ratification of the ERA was \"desirable; \" NOW wanted the public to influence the legislature to ratify the ERA; NOW operated on the presumption that legislators act with regard for the public interest.

Missouri apparently intends to argue that the District Court erred in not according this factor greater weight in determining whether Congress intended the boycott to be subject to antitrust regulation.

This statement does not control the disposition of the case before us, but rather leaves open the issue of whether a trade restraint intended as a political communication should be condemned under the Act.  The Court's reference to the railroads' use of the third-party technique in Noerr does not present an analogous circumstance to NOW's use of a boycott.

In rejecting the picketers' argument that their activity was protected dissemination of information, with violation of the state anti-trade restraint laws merely incidental, the Court stated: \"Such an expansive interpretation of the constitutional guarantees of speech and press would make it practically impossible ever to enforce laws against agreements in restraint of trade as well as many other agreements and conspiracies deemed injurious to society.\"  336 U.S. at 502, 69 S.Ct. at 691.

United States, 306 U.S. 208, 226-27, 59 S.Ct. 467, 474, 83 L.Ed. 610 (1939), which permits finding a conspiracy without finding any explicit agreement.  This test may not generally be appropriate in the circumstance of a noneconomic boycott because the normal assumptions regarding market power and the need for interdependence do not exist.  See Bird, supra note 2, 1970 Duke L.J. at 251-52; Kestenbaum, supra note 11, 54 Tex.L.Rev. at 1428.  In the situation of a boycott promoted by a group that does not have an economic or commercial motive, it may be desirable to probe more carefully into the interdependent nature of the concerted action and whether or to what degree coercion, economic or otherwise, as opposed to pure persuasion, is the impetus to the combination.  Furthermore, the distinction between acts of concerted refusal to deal and acts of persuasion or inducement may be relevant to a reconciliation of the first amendment and economic interests involved.  See Note, supra note 15, 91 Harv.L.Rev. at 687-91</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The difference between a primary and secondary boycott is one method of focusing on the potential extent of economic and anticompetitive injury because secondary boycotts have a more extenuated economic impact that direct refusals to deal.  See Bird, supra note 2, 1970 Duke L.Rev. at 253; Note, supra note 11, 30 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 178, 181, 190.  This distinction has been important in drawing the line between protected and unprotected activity in other noncommercial contexts, see, e. g., Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 505, 60 S.Ct. 982, 998, 84 L.Ed. 1311 (1940), and might be relevant to the balance to be drawn in this situation.  The District Court did not determine whether the convention boycott constituted a primary or secondary boycott</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Since the trust did not require state sanction, as did corporations, and since the trusts were not subject to the controls and restrictions that states could impose on corporations, they were more unwieldy than corporations.  1 E. Kintner, The Legislative History of the Federal Antitrust Laws and Related Statutes 10 (1978).  See generally id. at 8-13.  Public hostility towards the trusts in the late 1800's was immense and severe.  Id. at 11; Letwin, Congress and the Sherman Antitrust Law: 1887-1890, 23 U.Chi.L.Rev. 221, 235 (1956).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>Because a trust typically controlled the integrated levels of a particular industry, it could often control the means or sources of supply and dictate the prices or terms at which commodities would be bought, sold, or transported.  Moreover, large concerns often agreed to divide markets and to fix prices, engaged in predatory pricing, and discriminated in favor of certain entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 E. Kintner, supra at 11.  The kind of remedy that the public desired was a law to destroy the power of the trusts, Letwin, supra at 235, and such was the purpose of the Sherman Act.  But to limit the purpose to such a general one is misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, by prohibiting trusts, the Congress sought to achieve the preservation of free and fair competition.  See, e. g., 1 Kintner, supra at 113-18, quoting 21 Cong.Rec. 2456-58 (1890) (remarks of S. Sherman).  Unfortunately, an examination of the legislative history does not clearly indicate the answer to the question we have here whether Congress wanted to protect \"free and fair\" competition from political or social activities that can have the same effect upon competition as the commercial activities of a trust against a business.  See, i. e., Bird, Sherman Act Limitations on Noncommercial Concerted Refusals to Deal, 1970 Duke L.J. 247 (1970); Kestenbaum, The Antitrust Challenge to the Arab Boycott: Per Se Theory, Middle East Politics and United States v.

Mr. President, this is a very important subject.  The bill undertakes to deal with very great evils which in the last few years have done great injury to the people of the United States.  I am in favor of legislation to prevent trusts and combinations, but I want effective legislation legislation that will crush out these combinations and trusts.  * * *.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have given some thought and some reflection to this matter, and I am extremely anxious that some bill shall receive the assent of this Congress which will put an end forever to the practice, now becoming too common, of large corporations, and of single persons, too, of large wealth, so arranging that they dictate to the people of this country what they shall pay when they purchase, and what they shall receive when they sell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have considered with some care the provisions of this bill.  I do not believe that the effect of its provisions is accurately understood by members of this body.  I propose, therefore, to make an analysis of its provisions to see, if we can, what it means, what evils it undertakes to remedy, and what remedy it provides, and how efficacious this remedy may prove to be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the beginning, I desire to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that the provisions of this bill are not confined to trusts, to combinations, to arrangements and agreements made between parties who are engaged in business; or, in other words, taking the language of the bill in its plain meaning, it refers to and brings within the punitory provisions of the fourth section not only arrangements and agreements between manufacturers, between sellers, between transporters, but it brings within its grasp arrangements made by any persons, though merely for moral and for defensive purposes.  The bill provides</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations made with a view, or which tend, to prevent full and free competition in the importation, transportation, or sale of articles imported into the United States shall be unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That would apply to an arrangement, to an agreement, to a combination, not of a business character, but, as I before remarked, to such as is purely moral and defensive.  It does not say that all arrangements, contracts, etc., made between persons and corporations engaged in selling, transporting, importing, manufacturing, or producing the articles described in the bill shall be unlawful; but it applies to all persons whether so engaged or not.  So if this bill passes as it now stands, the farmers and laborers of this country who are sending up their voices to the Congress of the United States, asking, pleading, imploring us to take action to put down trusts, these farmers and these laborers will find that they themselves in their most innocent and necessary arrangements, made solely for defensive purposes against the operations of these trusts, will be brought within the punitory provisions of this bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will strike the Senate probably with some astonishment if it be ascertained that under this bill the arrangements made by the Southern farmers during the last season to prevent the consummation of the robbery of them by the jute-bagging trust are made highly criminal.  Under it the farmers of the South who combine to prevent and defeat that most iniquitous and unjust combination will find that they themselves rather than the jute-bagging trust will be the subjects of severe punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the formation of this bagging trust the cotton farmers of the South, many of them in their granges and in their alliances, agreed that they would not purchase jute bagging, and by that agreement to a very large extent the rich rewards anticipated by the men who formed the trust were defeated.  These combinations tended to prevent full and free competition in the sale of this article.  But if that is not very clear, if Senators think these arrangements of the farmers did not have the effect of preventing this full and free competition, I call their attention to another provision contained in the third section of the bill, which reads in this way:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If acts shall be done under any such arrangement, contract, agreement, trust, or combination, which have for their purpose, or which shall tend to compel the giving up or sale of any lawful business, the person, partnership, or corporation injured thereby may sue for and recover in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction the damages sustained thereby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The very object of this combination of Southern farmers was to break down the trust in jute bagging, to compel the men who had seized and got control of the bagging manufacture of this country to give up their business to loose their grip upon the business of the farmers.  It also very clearly violated the other provision of the bill to which I have just called attention.  The fact that the bill does not restrict these combinations, these agreements, to persons engaged in trade, engaged in transportation, engaged in importation, engaged in selling the fact that it applies to all arrangements, all agreements, all combinations, by whomsoever made, would bring within its reach all defensive agreements made by farmers for the purpose of enhancing the price of their products.

That is a very extraordinary proposition.  There is nothing in the bill to prevent a refusal by anybody to buy anything.

I insist that a society, making an agreement or a combination between citizens of a town anywhere in the Union not to drink, not to use in any way vinous or spirituous liquors, and to persuade others to a similar abstention, does, in the language of this bill, tend to compel persons engaged in retailing liquor in that community to give up their business, and the doing of that is expressly condemned by the third section of this bill.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. (WILLIAM M.)

I propose it as an addition to the proviso of section 1, and it is simply for the purpose of avoiding an effect which is likely to flow from the earlier provisions of that section.  That section provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between two or more persons or corporations, or both, made with a view or which tend to prevent full and free competition in the importation, transportation, or sale of articles imported into the United States, or with a view or which tend to prevent full and free competition in articles of growth, production, or manufacture of any State or Territory of the United States with similar articles of the growth, production, or manufacture of any other State or Territory, or in the transportation or sale of like articles, the production of any State or Territory of the United States, into or within any other State or Territory of the United States: and all arrangements, trusts, or combinations between such persons or corporations made with a view or which tend to advance the cost to the consumer of any such articles are hereby declared to be against public policy, unlawful, and void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will state frankly my purpose in offering the amendment.  Under the provisions of this section, should it become a law, every organization in such a State as Iowa, for instance, of the character of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Temperance Alliance, and other organizations intended to promote the execution of the laws of that State in respect of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors would become illegal bodies and their movements subject to the terms and provisions of this bill.  I know that was not intended, and yet the language, without being stripped of its power by the amendment I propose, would include all organizations of that kind.  All I ask is that the subjects within the police power of the States as embraced within that legislation, of Iowa and any other State which may desire similar legislation, shall not be embraced within this provision, but that the States shall be left free in the execution of their police powers.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will just add to what I have said that the proviso to which I offered this as an amendment excepts from the operations of this section of the bill arrangements, agreements, or combinations between laborers, made with a view of lessening the number of hours of their labor or of increasing their wages, and it also excepts arrangements, agreements, associations, or combinations among persons engaged in horticulture or agriculture, made with a view of enhancing the price of their own agricultural or horticultural products.  I think that the exception which I ask to have made by this amendment is quite as worthy of the support of the Senate as either of these.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. HOAR.  Allow me to ask the Senator if his amendment accomplishes his object.  I understand his object is to protect combinations of persons intended to discourage the use and manufacture of intoxicating liquors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. WILSON, of Iowa.  My object is to exclude them from the operation of the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. HOAR.  I understand, to protect them from being affected by it.  But the only description in his amendment is of such associations as are in aid of the execution of the laws of a State in pursuance of its police power.  Now, if this bill without his amendment would render the class of persons he has described subject to the penal provision, all temperance societies whose object is to persuade mankind not to use intoxicating liquors would still remain in spite of his amendment within the purview of the bill.  It seems to me he should extend his amendment a little further, because, as far as my State goes, this class of associations which he has described do not confine their efforts to the execution of the law, but their efforts are a great deal more extensive and extend to discouraging the use or manufacture of intoxicating liquors altogether.  This is what he means, and we would all vote for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. WILSON, of Iowa.  I am satisfied that my amendment will cover the purpose I have in view concerning my State.  If other Senators desire something further in regard to their States, they can move it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. HOAR.  I move to amend the Senator's amendment by adding to it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Or to discourage the use or manufacture of intoxicating liquors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And we will take a vote on that.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa showed me his amendment.  As these organizations in Iowa are associated and organized something in the nature of a corporation, there might be some reason for believing that they possibly might fall within the meaning of the clauses of the bill.  Therefore, I have no objection to his amendment, but I do not see any reason for putting in temperance societies any more than churches or school-houses or any other kind of moral or educational associations that may be organized.  Such an association is not in any sense a combination or arrangement made to interfere with interstate commerce; but under the peculiar circumstances, upon the facts stated by the Senator from Iowa, I think it is very proper to make an exception of those organizations in Iowa which are really in aid of the execution of State law.  I would apply it to all organizations which are using either moral or any other kind of means for the enforcement of local laws; but I do not think it is worth while to adopt the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts, because that would include temperance societies.  You might as well include churches and Sunday schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 250-52, quoting 21 Cong.Rec. 2658-59 (1890).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the exchanges reveal, the conversation provides an indication we do not set it out to show an affirmative statement of intent.  Yet, the indication is that it was the competitors in commerce that Senator Sherman had in mind as the concern of his bill, not noncompetitors motivated socially or politically in connection with legislation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the legislative history of the Sherman Act does not reveal that Congress intended to prohibit, with the Sherman Act, activities such as NOW's boycott; this is not inconsistent with the Supreme Court cases considering similar questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Case Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court in this case stated from the bench, \"this is a unique case.  It is different from any case in the law books anywhere.  There simply has never been another one like it.\"  Consequently, and as we noted earlier, the question of whether NOW's specific sort of activities an economic boycott, politically motivated, to achieve a legislative goal was intended by Congress to be within the scope of the Sherman Act, has not been specifically addressed by the Supreme Court.  We can, however, find guidance in several of the Court's opinions by noting a complete lack of an affirmative indication that such activities are covered, by taking cognizance of the Court's passing references that indicate that the activities that were meant to be covered are competitive activities by competitors with some self-enhancement motivation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and by a thorough analysis of Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.

It was the legislative history upon which the Parker Court relied the fact that \"(t)here is no suggestion of a purpose to restrain state action in the Act's legislative history\" in making its determination that the California raisin pro-rate program was not within the scope of the Sherman Act.  Parker v. Brown, supra, 317 U.S. at 351, 63 S.Ct. at 313.  Of particular importance to the Court's discussion was the fact that an unexpressed congressional purpose to nullify or restrain a state's control over its officers and agents should not be lightly attributed to Congress via the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, an infringement upon the people's right to petition the government by a boycott should also not be lightly attributed to Congress.  We perceive a more accurate phrasing of Congress' concern to be not the elimination of boycotts, but elimination of boycotts used by a competitor against a competitor (or against a supplier, customer, etc.) in the business of competing.  For example, in the legislative history to which the Court makes reference in Parker v. Brown, supra, 317 U.S. at 351, 63 S.Ct. at 313, 21 Cong.Rec. 2562 (1890), Senator Sherman states that the Act is meant to apply to \"business combinations,\" not to \"voluntary associations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Klor's, Inc. v.

Id. at 210-13, 79 S.Ct. at 708-710.  The Court also criticizes the court of appeals for its heavy reliance on Apex Hosiery Co. v.

While noting that there is some strong language in Apex that indicates section one Sherman Act violations must include an effect on market prices, the Court emphasizes that the defendant in Apex was a labor union and that part of the basis for the Apex decision was a recognition that the Sherman Act \"is aimed primarily at combinations having commercial objectives and is applied only to a very limited extent to organizations, like labor unions, which normally have other objectives.\"  Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., supra, 359 U.S. at 213 n.7, 79 S.Ct. at 710.  While the statement was not necessary to the outcome of the case, the Court's decision in Klor's includes a signal that the focus of the Sherman Act is upon commercial-business activities, and that the organization and objectives involved can make a difference in the application of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, at a minimum, in Parker, the Court tells us that the Sherman Act does not mean exactly what it says, i. e., \"all combinations in restraint of trade,\" and that the Act must be interpreted with the setting in which it was enacted; in Klor's, even when considering the impact of a boycott, the Court does not use overly broad language in holding that the Sherman Act covers such activity.  Instead, the Court focuses upon the business nature of the boycott, the intent of the Act to cover \"business combinations with commercial objectives,\" and concludes that the boycott is within the scope of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other cases considered by the Supreme Court help define the scope of the Sherman Act, and in a passive manner, limit the Act to apply to commercial activities, as opposed to social or political activities.

Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra.  Although the factual situation in Noerr differs from that of this case, sufficiently that we must specifically address those distinctions the overriding policy implications of Noerr are persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Noerr, the defendant railroads had engaged in a publicity campaign with the purpose of fostering the adoption and retention of laws that would be destructive of the trucking business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basically, the Supreme Court held that the railroads' campaign to get the legislature to pass laws, no matter how unethical that campaign was, was not within the scope of the Sherman Act.  The Court said, inter alia, \"no violation of the Act can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws.\"  Id. 365 U.S. at 135, 81 S.Ct. at 528.  Even this strict ruling sheds some light on the instant case inasmuch as NOW's boycott was stipulated to be an attempt to influence ratification by the Missouri legislature of the proposed ERA.

The legislation in Noerr directly concerned the alleged violators of the Sherman Act and the target of the alleged violation, the railroads and the truckers.  The parties were intimately affected by and concerned with the legislation as the legislation would either directly hurt or help them \"financially,\" \"economically,\" and \"commercially.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ERA is not a \"financial,\" \"economic,\" or \"commercial\" piece of legislation.  It is a social or political piece of legislation.  While it is obviously perceived by the members of NOW as beneficial, the record indicates, and it seems apparent, that the orientation of both parties, NOW and Missouri, to the ERA is not one of profit motivation.  The only financial, economic or commercial matter involved here is Missouri's concern about the financial repercussion of the boycott.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keeping in mind that what we are discussing is the applicability of the Sherman Act to the facts, and the intent of the Congress to cover such situations, the difference in the content of the legislation if anything makes it more clear that NOW's efforts to influence the legislature's action on the ERA are beyond the scope and intent of the Sherman Act.  A social piece of legislation and the efforts involved in influencing the legislature's actions on such legislation is further afield from the central focus of the Sherman Act than a commercial piece of legislation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the petitioning efforts associated therewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, considered in isolation, the subject matter of the ERA is not helpful to Missouri's arguments.  Missouri, however, argues the relevancy of the distinction in connection with its \"secondary boycott\" theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Missouri refers to NOW's activities as a secondary boycott and argues that the district court, in not specifically finding that there was a secondary boycott, erred in its factual findings.  Missouri argues that the error taints the district court's other findings and its analysis of the legal issues.  The only clue as to exactly how this taint distorts the district court's findings is Missouri's claim that it affected the court's statement that if this \"were not a legitimate effort to influence the legislature, this Court would be presented with a different case.\"  Missouri v. National Organization for Women, Inc., supra, 467 F.Supp. at 306 (emphasis added by Missouri in its brief).  Missouri appears to equate legitimate efforts to influence a legislature with ethical or non-harmful efforts to influence the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court establishes the fallacy of this equation in Noerr.  In its discussion of the railroad's publicity campaign used to influence the legislature which, besides being unethical and harmful, was characterized as deceptive and vicious, the Court noted that the campaign was intended to and did injure the truckers in their relationship with their customers.  But</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p>(i)nsofar as that Act sets up a code of ethics at all, it is a code that condemns trade restraints, not political activity, and, as we have already pointed out, a publicity campaign to influence governmental action falls clearly into the category of political activity.  The proscriptions of the Act, tailored as they are for the business world, are not at all appropriate for application in the political arena.  Congress has traditionally exercised extreme caution in legislating with respect to problems relating to the conduct of political activities, a caution which has been reflected in the decisions of this Court interpreting such legislation.  All of this caution would go for naught if we permitted an extension of the Sherman Act to regulate activities of that nature simply because those activities have a commercial impact and involve conduct that can be termed unethical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 140-41, 81 S.Ct. at 531 (footnote omitted).  The boycott in this case had a commercial impact and has been called unethical.  But it is political activity aimed at persuading the legislature to take action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Missouri also claims that the existence of the boycott takes this case out of the scope of Noerr, in that the boycott does not fit within Noerr's controlling principle that Sherman Act violations cannot be predicated upon \"mere attempts\" to influence the passage of laws.  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 135, 81 S.Ct. at 528.  The boycott, Missouri argues, makes NOW's activities more than a \"mere attempt.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming this to be accurate, one need not go further than the Noerr case to determine what controls when there is more than a mere attempt.  The Noerr Court initially discusses the three considerations which lead to the Court's conclusion that activities which are comprised of mere solicitation of governmental action with respect to the passage of laws are not violative of the Sherman Act.  Those are (1) the essential dissimilarity between an agreement to jointly seek legislation and the agreements traditionally condemned by the Sherman Act; (2) that such a holding would have the effect of recognizing that the government has the power to act in a representative capacity in refusing the people the right to freely inform the government of their wishes; and (3) generally, but \"of at least equal significance, such a construction of the Sherman Act would raise important constitutional questions.\"  Id. at 137-38, 81 S.Ct. at 529-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the Court then went on to consider, as a separate issue, whether the publicity campaign and the techniques used, including the much-discussed \"third-party technique,\" would take the railroad's actions out of the controlling principle discussed in regard to the mere solicitation of the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enlightening as to what this so-called third-party technique is the Noerr district court's discussion of it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p>One of the objectives was the enactment of legislation, not under the sponsorship of the railroads but by others acting on their behalf, by what was called in inoffensive and pleasing language, \"The third-party technique.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * * It was also determined that the campaign should be handled through an independent public relations firm.  A number of public relations firms were interviewed and of the four or five selected for interview, all were leaders in that particular field.  It may be noted in passing that of those interviewed and who submitted proposals, about which proposals testimony was given at the trial, each and every one of the suggested programs provided for a campaign of publicity to put the truckers in a bad light with the public; to encourage normal public resentment of the motoring public to the operation of big trucks on the highways; to secure the assistance of organizations which were apparently \"independent and public spirited\" in the campaign against the truckers, and to create a demand for legislation penalizing the truckers either by limitation of size and weight or the imposition of user taxes which would make their operation unprofitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noerr Motor Freight, Inc. v.

These objectives, including the crystallization of motorist resentment arising from commercial heavy truck operations over the roads, were designed to arouse the public generally of the need to obtain new methods of financing public highways and by methods which would not appear to emanate from railroad sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 778-79 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, an additional factor in Noerr that which was more than mere solicitation was the railroads' third-party technique; further, part of the public relations firm's job was to \"create a demand for legislation\" by creating public resentment of the trucks.  Finally, similar to NOW's goals, the railroad had an ultimate objective the legislation and an intermediate goal injury to the truckers.  In the NOW case, the ultimate objective is legislation, and the intermediate goal is inflicting economic injury with the hope of achieving that ultimate objective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In direct response to the use of the third-party technique, the Noerr Court emphasized that the Sherman Act condemns trade restraints and not political activity.  The Supreme Court discussed the \"publicity campaign\" (pseudonym for the third-party technique and the intermediate goal of inflicting injury) as falling clearly within the category of political activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"additional factors\" that took the railroad in Noerr beyond mere solicitation did not include a boycott.  And the Court in Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., supra, very pointedly made clear that boycotts are destructive, very possibly more destructive than the third-party technique.  Yet, at the bottom line, the Noerr \"additional factors\" and the additional factors in this case cannot be analytically distinguished insofar as it is relevant to the applicability of the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the Noerr Court noted that there were no specific findings that the railroads attempted directly to persuade anyone not to deal with the truckers.  Here, NOW did attempt and did succeed in persuading others who were \"customers\" of the State of Missouri not to deal with Missouri.  However, the crux of the issue is that NOW was politically motivated to use a boycott to influence ratification of the ERA.  In our case, as in Noerr, the publicity campaign was not a mere sham to cover up an attempt to interfere with the business relationship of a competitor.  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 144, 81 S.Ct. at 533.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, notwithstanding the superficial impact of the Noerr Court's statement that the railroads never directly tried to stop customers from dealing with truckers, and the inherent conflict that the boycott in this case creates with that statement, the distinction is that the NOW boycott is a tool, not just a competitive purpose, just as the \"publicity campaign/third-party technique\" in Noerr was a tool.  The results of the tools are the same.  The facts demonstrate the similarity.  In Noerr,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p>(c)irculars, speeches, newspaper articles, editorials, magazine articles, memoranda and all other documents discuss in one way or another the railroads' charges that heavy trucks injure the roads, violate the laws and create traffic hazards, and urge that truckers should be forced to pay a fair share of the costs of rebuilding the roads, that they should be compelled to obey the laws, and that limits should be placed upon the weight of the loads they are permitted to carry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 142-43, 81 S.Ct. at 532.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, NOW's concerted activities and publicity campaign were initiated to show that in not ratifying the ERA, Missouri was denying rights to women, and in order to show displeasure with Missouri and to show support for the ERA, organizations were urged by NOW not to hold their conventions in Missouri.  The ultimate goal was to have the ERA ratified and the hope was that by boycotting the state for as long as the ERA remained unratified in that state, it would result in a favorable legislative vote.  State of Missouri v. National Organization for Women, Inc., supra, 467 F.Supp. at 292.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that there were active solicitations by NOW followed by a boycott decision by the recipients of the solicitation.  Id. at 295.  And yet, borrowing from the Supreme Court's language in Noerr, the finding by the district court in the instant case that NOW's campaign was intended to and did in fact injure Missouri in its relationship with its convention customers can mean no more than that Missouri sustained a direct injury as an incidental effect of NOW's campaign to influence governmental action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p>It is inevitable, whenever an attempt is made to influence legislation by a campaign of publicity, (<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> that an incidental effect of that campaign may be the infliction of some direct injury upon the interests of the party against whom the campaign is directed.  * * *  To hold that the knowing infliction of such injury renders the campaign itself illegal would thus be tantamount to outlawing all such campaigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 143-44, 81 S.Ct. at 533.  NOW appears to have utilized its political power to bring about the ratification of the ERA by the State of Missouri.  The tool it chose was a boycott, a device economic by nature.  However, using a boycott in a non-competitive political arena for the purpose of influencing legislation is not proscribed by the Sherman Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, while we do not pretend that Noerr disposes of all the questions in this case, we additionally do not feel that the distinctions discussed above, notably, the use of a boycott and the injury of a noncompetitor (Missouri) by a noncompetitor (NOW), are relevant to the applicability of the Sherman Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There resulted a restraint of trade in the Noerr case just as has occurred in this case.  In Noerr it was accomplished by means of a publicity campaign with the ultimate goal of obtaining legislation that commercially or competitively affected the competitor-campaigners and competitor-target.  In the instant case, it was accomplished by means of a publicity-boycott campaign with the ultimate goal of obtaining socially or politically-oriented legislation that had no effect upon the campaigners or target, at least in a commercial or business sense.

Trucking Unlimited, supra, was the one that dealt with it in the most expanded manner.  In Motor Transport, Justice Douglas stated that the Noerr decision rested upon two grounds: (1) that there was no basis in the Sherman Act's legislative history by which to impute a purpose to regulate political activity and (2) that \"(t)he right of petition is one of the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, and we cannot, of course, lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these freedoms.\"  Id. 404 U.S. at 510, 92 S.Ct. at 611, quoting Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra, 365 U.S. at 138, 81 S.Ct. at 530.  After stating this, the Court then extended the Noerr philosophy to the use of the channels and procedures of state and federal agencies and courts on the basis that not to do so would be destructive of the rights of association and of petition.  Id., 404 U.S. at 510, 92 S.Ct. at 611.  More importantly, in the course of invoking the sham exception to the Noerr case, the Court's focus is on the First Amendment rights, id. at 510-516, 92 S.Ct. at 611-614; \"First Amendment rights may not be used as the means or the pretext for achieving 'substantive evils' * * * which the legislature has the power to control.\"  Id. at 515, 92 S.Ct. at 614, quoting NAACP v.

Thus the central point in California Motor and the other cases citing Noerr is the shift in focus from the Noerr holding that the railroads' activities are beyond the intent of Congress, insofar as the Sherman Act is concerned, to the Noerr statement that there are serious constitutional questions involved also.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court continued its mention of the constitutional issue presented in Noerr in Lafayette v.

The court observed that since the convention boycott took place in essentially a political context, and could be characterized as \"noncommercial\" and \"noneconomic,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> the \"essential dissimilarity\" between the convention boycott and those agreements traditionally held violative of section 1 of the Sherman Act was greater in this case than in Noerr.  Thus, the holding in Noerr was considered dispositive of the applicability of the Sherman Act to the NOW boycott.  I believe that this is an over-broad interpretation of the Noerr case and ignores the basic factual difference between Noerr and the present situation of an economic boycott.  Most significantly, the District Court practically ignored the critical issue in dispute by merely assuming, without any analysis, that NOW's actions were themselves \"an exercise of first amendment rights.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>  The majority opinion follows this same course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with any exercise of statutory construction, our first duty is to look to the language of the statute itself.

In order to show an exclusion from antitrust enforcement, the Court stated that it is necessary to demonstrate \"countervailing policies which are sufficiently weighty to overcome the presumption.\"  435 U.S. at 400, 98 S.Ct. at 1130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority does not directly address Missouri's arguments on appeal but rather, through a generalized study, seeks to show that the District Court was correct in concluding that the NOW boycott falls outside the scope of the Sherman Act.  The majority's analysis, however, inadequately balances the competing interests.  An appropriate analysis of the issue in this case requires careful consideration of whether the convention boycott constitutes constitutionally protected activity under the first amendment; otherwise it must fall within the proscriptions of the antitrust laws as an obvious concerted action to restrain trade and inflict economic harm.  Both the District Court and the majority appear to have resolved this issue simply on the basis that NOW's motivation in instituting the boycott was to influence ratification by the Missouri Legislature of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).  This resolution insufficiently addresses the critical balancing necessary because it virtually ignores the anticompetitive and disruptive effect of the adverse economic impact of NOW's conduct and fails to acknowledge government's legitimate interest in protecting and regulating interstate commerce<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> and in maintaining a competitive economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority apparently acknowledges that a political boycott can have the same effect upon competition as a commercial boycott, and also recognizes that the legislative history of the Sherman Act does not provide an answer to the question of whether Congress intended to protect competition from the adverse effects of politically motivated economic restraints.  Ante at 1305.  The majority's review of the legislative history merely reveals an absence of any stated affirmative intent to provide coverage.  Their review of case law similarly simply led to a conclusion that there was a lack of an affirmative indication that politically motivated, economic boycotts are covered by the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a>  Ante at 1309.  Without greater support, NOW's exclusion defense must surely be rejected in view of the presumption against implied exclusions, City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., supra, 435 U.S. at 399, 98 S.Ct. at 1129, and the comprehensive language of the Act, the literal terms of which clearly encompass NOW's activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the majority returns to Noerr for guidance and concludes that because NOW's conduct was motivated by the purpose of influencing the passage of legislation, the conduct implicated the right to petition government for redress of grievances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a> raising important constitutional questions, and was essentially dissimilar to conduct traditionally condemned by the Sherman Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> and that therefore NOW's conduct falls without the bounds of antitrust regulation.  Unfortunately, the majority does not directly address the important constitutional questions raised, finding that their simple emergence suffices to resolve the question of antitrust coverage.  Furthermore, the majority deems \"superficial\" the Noerr Court's clear attempt to distinguish the railroads' publicity campaign from the situation of a direct concerted refusal to deal, Noerr, supra, 365 U.S. at 136, 81 S.Ct. at 528.  Ante at 1314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the majority finds that \"the crux of the issue is that NOW was politically motivated to use a boycott,\" ante at 1314, Missouri contends that the focus must be upon the use of the boycott, not its motivation, because the antitrust laws are designed to protect against the anticompetitive effect of restraints of trade inherent in a boycott, regardless of its motivation.  Although the majority seeks to dismiss this effect by characterizing it as \"incidental\" and portraying the context of the boycott as a \"noncompetitive political arena,\" ante at 1315, the congressional intent to preserve and foster free market competition cannot be summarily dismissed or ignored.  The arena may not be economically competitive with regard to NOW, and NOW may not have economic interests at stake in this controversy, but the boycott severely affects the competitive posture of Missouri convention interests and the overall economic welfare of Missouri residents.  Thus, the technical characterization of the boycott as noncommercial and noneconomic is misleading<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a> and actually erroneous in important respects.  The anticompetitive economic and commercial effects of the boycott on Missouri's legitimate business interests and welfare are identical, regardless of whether the motivation for the boycott is political or economic.  The majority thus places the court's imprimatur upon a boycott with potentially severe economic and commercial consequences simply on the basis of the boycott's motivation.  The precedential support for drawing this distinction is tenuous at best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority explicitly states: \"(W)e do not rest our decision in this case upon the basis that the boycott was noncommercial and non-economic.  Our decision is based upon the right to use political activities to petition the government, as was the underlying factor in Noerr.\"  Ante at 1315, n.16.  The majority holding is thus conceived as supported or commanded by the Noerr decision.  Noerr held that concerted publicity to influence favorable legislative activity harmful in some respects to others was protected by the first amendment and not violative of the antitrust laws.  It dealt with the situation of a publicity campaign to influence legislative action; there was no refusal to deal in Noerr, nor was any economic boycott involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at issue is considerably different.  As Missouri succinctly states: \"The Noerr case was a combination to get legislation harmful to others.  The NOW case is a combination to harm others to get legislation * * *.\"  Unlike the infliction of some direct injury in Noerr, the direct economic injury to Missouri is not an incidental effect of the tool used to influence government action; the injury itself constitutes the tool used.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a>  Unlike the pure publicity campaign of Noerr, NOW went beyond providing the public and legislators with information (however reliable), and actively induced and combined with others<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> to boycott a specific, identifiable segment of a highly competitive industry, the convention industry in states that had not ratified the ERA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These factual distinctions between Noerr and the case at bar mandate that the court in this case undertake a more comprehensive balancing of the important governmental interest in preserving the free enterprise system with the interest of people to use this particular method of influencing legislation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a>  Noerr simply does not imply the conclusion that the first amendment immunizes politically motivated boycotts against antitrust attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a>  This brings us back to the crucial question of whether, upon balancing the first amendment interests of NOW with the substantial and important governmental interests embodied in the antitrust laws, the politically motivated economic boycott falls within the ambit of the antitrust laws or is constitutionally protected by the first amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This formulation of the critical issue involved herein leads the court into the delicate and complicated area of first amendment law concerning communicative conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a>  While I can well appreciate the majority's reluctance to attack these sensitive issues, I feel it is necessary to assure consistent evaluation of similar claims<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1\" id=\"fn17-1_ref\">17</a> and to bring forth all of the factual findings that are relevant to a thorough consideration of each claim.  As a single member of the court I hesitate to arrogate to myself the role of endorsing a particular scheme of analysis.  Because of the District Court's failure to address the constitutional issue and its failure to accord significant weight to important and substantial governmental interests, I would remand to the District Court with instructions to make further factual findings and apply a balancing analysis to the first amendment issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court found as a matter of fact that the activities of NOW would be encompassed within the meaning of the terms \"combination or conspiracy\" of section 1 of the Sherman Act.  467 F.Supp. at 296.  The evidence here conclusively supports this finding, as NOW admittedly induced and solicited the support of other groups.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-1\" id=\"fn18-1_ref\">18</a>  The court below, however, investigated the extent of economic harm that would flow from this concerted refusal to deal only in relation to the issue of standing.  It never undertook to balance the disruptive effect upon free market competition with the asserted first amendment rights, even though the potential economic and competitive injury that can flow from a particular practice is clearly relevant to an evaluation of the importance of the governmental interest in regulating that practice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  See note 8 supra.

Further, the facts clearly reveal, and the district court so found, that there were no punitive intentions involved in the boycott insofar as punishment for Missouri's past failure to ratify the ERA was concerned</p>\n        <p>We find Missouri's focus on the facts of this case and not the the district court's misleading.  The district court's view is more appropriate for the issues at hand.  NOW's boycott was directed against states that had yet to ratify the proposed ERA.  NOW was aware that such a boycott would work against the public's economic interests; NOW was hopeful that the public's interest would suffer to the extent that the public would be persuaded that ratification of the ERA was \"desirable; \" NOW wanted the public to influence the legislature to ratify the ERA; NOW operated on the presumption that legislators act with regard for the public interest.  This is not distinguishable analytically from Noerr.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> In essence, Missouri tries to limit Noerr to a case where a combination uses publicity to get a law passed that would harm the truckers.

They may, however, aid an evaluation of first amendment claims and a determination of whether the interaction of the boycotters is sufficient to find a combination or conspiracy.  Great economic injury and interference with free market competition can result from a boycott, regardless of its motivation.  See Bird, supra, note 2, 1970 Duke L.J. at 261.  In a sense, \"it would be hard to say that any boycott is purely non-commercial in character.

This statement does not control the disposition of the case before us, but rather leaves open the issue of whether a trade restraint intended as a political communication should be condemned under the Act.  The Court's reference to the railroads' use of the third-party technique in Noerr does not present an analogous circumstance to NOW's use of a boycott.

In reviewing military regulations that unquestionably impinge upon conduct involving first amendment rights (solicitation of signatures on and circulation of petitions to members of Congress), the Court balanced the first amendment interests with the \"substantial government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression\" sought to be protected by the regulations (military effectiveness).  --- U.S. at ----, 100 S.Ct. at 599, 62 L.Ed.2d at 547.  Although forwarding individual communications to Congress was not restricted, group petitioning was distinguished and held to warrant special restrictions on free expression as reasonably necessary to promote the substantial government interest.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> It is difficult to determine where to draw the line in balancing the various interests, and while it is easy to conclude that political action should not immunize from antitrust attack behavior that is \"unnecessarily harmful\" to competition, devising a standard to implement the appropriate balance and take into account all the necessary factors is difficult.  One standard proposed is:</p>\n        <p>Behavior is \"unnecessarily harmful\" to competition when it is excessively dangerous without being indispensable to the political activity.  Analysis of whether conduct is indispensable to the political activity depends upon (1) the severity of the danger to competition, (2) the availability of a less dangerous alternative, and (3) the customary political character of the challenged behavior.</p>\n        <p>Book Review, 11 Rut.-Cam.L.J. 19, 23 n.36 (1979) (citations omitted), restating the standard proposed in 1 Areeda &amp; Turner, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application, PP 201-06 (1978).

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span> (1949), the Court confronted a conflict between first amendment rights of peaceful picketers and the state's valid interest in forbidding agreements in restraint of trade.  In rejecting the picketers' argument that their activity was protected dissemination of information, with violation of the state anti-trade restraint laws merely incidental, the Court stated: \"Such an expansive interpretation of the constitutional guarantees of speech and press would make it practically impossible ever to enforce laws against agreements in restraint of trade as well as many other agreements and conspiracies deemed injurious to society.\"  336 U.S. at 502, 69 S.Ct. at 691.  In National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, supra, dealing with the curtailment of first amendment rights of expression on competitive bidding held to be violative of the antitrust laws, the Court held that:</p>\n        <p>While the resulting order may curtail the exercise of liberties that the Society might otherwise enjoy, that is a necessary and, in cases such as this, unavoidable consequence of the violation.  Just as an injunction against price fixing abridges the freedom of businessmen to talk to one another about prices, so too the injunction in this case must restrict the Society's range of expression on the ethics of competitive bidding.</p>\n        <p>435 U.S. at 697, 98 S.Ct. at 1368.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> For a comprehensive scholarly examination of the thorny first amendment issue in this case, see Note, Political Boycott Activity and the First Amendment, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 630 (1978)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The majority's attempt to distinguish this case from Council of Defense v.

The difficulty in differentiating political speech from petitioning the government will be great and does not seem warranted by the language of the first amendment, see Bird, supra note 2, at 288 n.161.  In both situations the analysis should reckon with the potential economic disruption produced by the manner of using economic weapons as communication.  Furthermore, the Council of Defense case simply cannot be distinguished on the basis of an intent to inflict punishment for past actions.  The Council evidently believed that Hearst had pro-German sympathies which continued and would continue to bias his reporting.  In a sense, the Council's ultimate motive could be considered in part a show of support for war-related legislation.  Unfortunately, the majority's decision to address this precedent obliquely rather than directly may leave in confusion the basic issue of when economic tools may be used with impunity in pursuit of social and political goals</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-1_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> A recurring and complicated antitrust problem is how to determine the existence of an agreement to restrain trade.  See Turner, The Definition of Agreement under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 655 (1962).  The District Court applied the legal test articulated in Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103152\"><a href=\"/opinion/103152/interstate-circuit-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 226-27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103152\"><a href=\"/opinion/103152/interstate-circuit-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span> (1939), which permits finding a conspiracy without finding any explicit agreement.  This test may not generally be appropriate in the circumstance of a noneconomic boycott because the normal assumptions regarding market power and the need for interdependence do not exist.  See Bird, supra note 2, 1970 Duke L.J. at 251-52; Kestenbaum, supra note 11, 54 Tex.L.Rev. at 1428.  In the situation of a boycott promoted by a group that does not have an economic or commercial motive, it may be desirable to probe more carefully into the interdependent nature of the concerted action and whether or to what degree coercion, economic or otherwise, as opposed to pure persuasion, is the impetus to the combination.  Furthermore, the distinction between acts of concerted refusal to deal and acts of persuasion or inducement may be relevant to a reconciliation of the first amendment and economic interests involved.  See Note, supra note 15, 91 Harv.L.Rev. at 687-91</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The difference between a primary and secondary boycott is one method of focusing on the potential extent of economic and anticompetitive injury because secondary boycotts have a more extenuated economic impact that direct refusals to deal.  See Bird, supra note 2, 1970 Duke L.Rev. at 253; Note, supra note 11, 30 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 178, 181, 190.  This distinction has been important in drawing the line between protected and unprotected activity in other noncommercial contexts, see, e. g., Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103367\"><a href=\"/opinion/103367/apex-hosiery-co-v-leader/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 505, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103367\"><a href=\"/opinion/103367/apex-hosiery-co-v-leader/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
