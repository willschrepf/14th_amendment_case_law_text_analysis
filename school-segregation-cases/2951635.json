(WPI) for age\n\ndiscrimination under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act. A jury found in favor of\n\nBarbour and awarded her $40,000 in damages for back pay, $10,000 in lost employment\n\nbenefits, $100,000 in past compensatory damages, and $100,000 in future compensatory\n\ndamages. The trial court determined that the statutory caps required under Texas Labor Code\n\nSection 21.2585(d)(1) should be applied to the jury’s award of damages and rendered judgment\n\nfor Barbour in the amount of $120,714, exclusive of attorney’s fees and costs. Based on a prior\n\nagreement between the parties, the trial court then addressed Barbour’s claim for attorney’s fees.\n\nIn her claim for attorney’s fees, Barbour asked the court to apply a multiplier to enhance her fee\n\naward. After the hearing, the trial court determined that Barbour was entitled to attorney’s fees\n\nin the amount of $154,335, but concluded that it did not possess the authority under Section\n\f21.259 of the Texas Labor Code to apply a multiplier. The court specifically ruled that if did\n\nhave such authority, a 1.5 multiplier was appropriate.\n\n       WPI then filed the instant appeal. It challenges the trial court’s judgment, complaining\n\nthat: (1) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s verdict that age\n\nwas a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate Barbour, and (2) that the trial court\n\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Barbour’s discrimination case because she failed to fully\n\nexhaust her administrative remedies before filing suit. Barbour also appeals, contending that the\n\ntrial court erred by not applying a multiplier to her attorney’s fee award. For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we affirm the judgment in its entirety.\n\n                                    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n\n       WPI develops and manufactures products for various industries involved in oil and gas\n\ndevelopment, fire suppression, aeronautics, and national defense. In 1988, Bob Williams hired\n\ntwenty-six year old Rhonda Barbour to work at WPI. Mr. Williams was the co-founder of WPI\n\nand, at the time he hired Barbour, he was also WPI’s president and CEO. When Mr. Williams\n\nhired Barbour he was looking to expand WPI’s business to include a new line of fire\n\nextinguishers or fire suppression devices.        He personally trained Barbour to assemble the\n\nproducts on the new fire extinguisher/suppression line. More specifically, Mr. Williams taught\n\nBarbour to assemble the “charge caps” for WPI’s fire-suppression product known as the\n\n“StoveTop FireStop.” The assembly of the charge caps involved the use of a dangerous and\n\nexplosive chemical called lead styphnate. The government considers lead styphnate to be an\n\nexplosive and therefore heavily regulates its use. Accordingly, because of the dangers involved,\n\nthe charge caps were assembled in a specific room, separated from the rest of WPI’s business.\n\nDealing with these explosives also required Barbour to possess a special set of skills.\n\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f        About a year after Barbour was hired, WPI established a specific assembly line for the\n\nsole purpose of manufacturing the fire suppression devices. The line was referred to as the “pyro\n\nline.” Barbour was the supervisor of the pyro-line and she was responsible for training the new\n\nemployees.1\n\n        In 1996, Mr. Williams passed away and his wife, Della Williams, took over as President\n\nand CEO of WPI.2 According to Mrs. Williams, handling the lead styphnate was the most\n\ndangerous aspect of WPI’s operation. She also acknowledged that the very existence of the pyro\n\nline depended upon Barbour building the charge caps.\n\n        Barbour continued her work assembling charge caps for the fire suppression devices for\n\nher first seventeen years as a WPI employee. James Craig Walters supervised Barbour from\n\n1998 to 2004. He testified that Barbour:\n\n        [C]could use some improvement because she is quick to talk about people behind\n        their back and stir up criticism pools with other employees. I addressed this\n        problem with her and she said it was from being frustrated but in the end she\n        agreed to stop.\n\nAccording to Walters, on Barbour’s 2003 work performance review he specifically noted that\n\nthere were improvements he wanted to see. Barbour was good at “repetitive tasks,” but that she\n\nwas not good at tasks that involved change. Although Walters did not recall ever giving Barbour\n\na written warning, he testified that he spoke with her on several occasions regarding her\n\nbehavior. He considered these discussions oral reprimands or warnings.\n\n        In 2005, the company completed development on a safer alternative to the charge caps,\n\nwhich did not involve the use of explosives. This new design no longer required Barbour’s\n\n1\n  Sally Espinoza was also a supervisor on the pyro line. Espinosa testified that Barbour was a good employee and a\nhard worker. She also testified that Barbour was easy to get along with and that she never observed any combative\nbehavior by Barbour.\n2\n  At the time Mrs. Williams took over control and ownership of the company WPI had nine employees. By the time\nof trial (May 2011), WPI employed ninety-nine employees.\n\n\n                                                      -3-\n\fspecialized skills, nor did it require the assembly to occur in an isolated environment. According\n\nto Mrs. Williams, as the new design was implemented, the old method of using lead styphnate\n\nwas phased out. Likewise, Barbour’s position was effectively phased out.\n\n          Barbour was then re-assigned to the “connectivity and test systems” (CaTS) assembly\n\nline.3 The CaTS assembly area included both mechanical and electrical assembly. Although\n\nBarbour had previously spent the majority of her time working on the pyro assembly line, she\n\nhad worked on both the electrical and mechanical assembly lines from time to time as needed.\n\n          Employees in the CaTS assembly area each had work orders, or written instructions, at\n\ntheir work stations describing the device(s) being assembled. Once a work order was complete,\n\nit was reviewed by the WPI Quality Assurance Department. The Quality Assurance Department\n\nwould check each work order and return any orders containing errors.\n\n          Tammy Renteria, a CaTS assembly leader, testified that an assembly leader also had a\n\nduty to go from station to station along the CaTS assembly line, double-check each assembler’s\n\nwork, and see whether the assemblers had any questions or otherwise needed work orders or\n\nparts for assembly.\n\n          When Barbour began working on the CaTS assembly line, her supervisor was Stacy\n\nChapa. Chapa supervised Barbour from June 2005 to December 2005, during which Barbour\n\nreceived two positive performance evaluations. The first performance evaluation was signed by\n\nPaul Shiller, WPI’s Operations Manager, and gave Barbour a “good” rating.                 The second\n\nperformance evaluation, signed by Vice President Brent Williams, included the following\n\ncomments regarding Barbour’s performance:                     (1) “tracks and completes assigned work\n\nindependently after initial instructions and feedback;” (2) “positive and supportive of the\n\n\n3\n    At the time she was re-assigned in 2005, Barbour was 42 years old.\n\n\n                                                        -4-\n\fcompany’s mission;” (3) “knows the status of tasks the standards for accuracy and quantity;” (4)\n\n“exhibits patience with customers/co-workers;” (5) “maintains courteous and cooperative\n\nrelationships with supervisor and co-workers;” and (6) “accepts supervision, change and\n\nfeedback.” Based on this evaluation, Barbour received a pay raise. Chapa testified that as of\n\nDecember 2005, she had worked with Barbour for seventeen years and never had any problems\n\nwith her.\n\n          Jose “Joe” Montalvo began working at WPI in 2004 as a Quality Inspector. He was later\n\npromoted to supervisor of the Quality Inspection area (or Quality Assurance Department). At\n\nthe time Barbour was reassigned to the CaTS assembly line in 2005, Montalvo was the\n\nsupervisor in charge of the quality inspection area. In April or May 2006, Montalvo became the\n\nproduction manager for the CaTS assembly area.4                       As production manager, Montalvo also\n\nbecame Barbour’s direct supervisor.\n\n          According to Barbour, in 2005 Montalvo began making age-related comments to her. He\n\nmade comments about her gray hair and told her that she was getting old and looking old. He\n\nalso suggested that she color her hair, stating that if she were his wife, she would not look like\n\nshe did. On occasions when she was in the inventory room and would have to bend over,\n\nMontalvo would tell her that her butt was getting big and that she was looking old. Montalvo\n\neventually mentioned replacing Barbour with “young Mexican girls.”                      Barbour said these\n\ncomments were made three or four times a week. She also testified that Montalvo’s tone was\n\nserious and that his comments made her scared and sick.\n\n          Once Montalvo became her direct supervisor on the CaTS assembly line, he continued to\n\nmake comments about her age. At that point, Barbour decided to report the comments to Paul\n\n\n4\n    This was the first time Montalvo had been Barbour’s supervisor.\n\n\n                                                        -5-\n\fShiller, the Operations Manager. According to Barbour, in May or June 2006, she reported\n\nMontalvo’s behavior to Shiller. She told Shiller, in detail, about all of Montalvo’s age-related\n\ncomments. Montalvo admitted making some comments related to the color of Barbour’s hair but\n\nsaid he was only joking.\n\n       Shiller acknowledged that Barbour came to him regarding Montalvo’s comments but she\n\nmentioned them casually and never described them with any specificity. Shiller questioned\n\nMontalvo about the comments, but that conversation was the end of the matter.             Shiller\n\nacknowledged that under WPI’s policy, a complaint of discrimination should have been reported\n\nto Human Resources for investigation. But admittedly, he never reported the comments to\n\nHuman Resources and the claim was not investigated. Sally Espinosa, a former supervisor at\n\nWPI, testified that she heard Montalvo tell Barbour that she was getting too old and fat and that\n\nWPI needed to hire younger girls. Martha Thomas, a CaTS assembly line worker, also testified\n\nregarding Montalvo’s behavior. According to Thomas, things changed when Montalvo became\n\nsupervisor of the CaTS assembly line. She believed Montalvo was trying to get her to resign,\n\nwhich she did in 2008.\n\n       Mr. Walters, Barbour’s supervisor from 1998 to 2004, testified that he observed Barbour\n\ninteracting with Montalvo but he never heard Montalvo make derogatory comments toward\n\nBarbour.\n\n       Mrs. Williams, owner of WPI, testified that she was never informed about Barbour’s\n\ncomplaints regarding Montalvo. She found the comments offensive and they should have been\n\nreported to the Human Resources Department. According to her, even jokes about age should be\n\nreported to Human Resources. On November 15, 2006, WPI terminated Barbour’s employment.\n\nThe only people in the room were Montalvo, Shiller, and Candace Woodard from Human\n\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\fResources. Montalvo did all the talking. Barbour was not given a reason for her termination.\n\nBarbour asked to speak to Mrs. Williams or her son, Brent Williams, but was told by Montalvo\n\nthat they “had already been informed.” Montalvo admitted that he never gave Barbour a written\n\nreprimand prior to terminating her. He also admitted that he generally gives an employee an oral\n\nwarning and a written reprimand before terminating that employee, and that he had given other\n\nemployees written warnings if they had done something “really wrong.”               According to\n\nMontalvo, he had orally reprimanded Barbour at some point, but Barbour testified that she never\n\nreceived a verbal warning while for WPI. No written reprimands appear in Barbour’s file.\n\n                                  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          On December 13, 2006, Barbour filed an administrative complaint with the Texas\n\nWorkforce Commission (TWC) alleging age discrimination as the reason for her termination.\n\nTWC forwarded Barbour’s complaint to WPI on December 22, 2006.                 After investigating\n\nBarbour’s discrimination claims, the TWC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Right to File a Civil\n\nAction.\n\n          After her termination, Barbour also applied for unemployment benefits with the TWC.\n\nIn January 2007, a telephone hearing was conducted. Montalvo and Human Resources\n\nrepresentative Candace Woodard participated in the telephone hearing on behalf of WPI.\n\nMontalvo stated that Barbour was terminated because of errors on a contact socket order and a\n\nknob order and her scheduling of time on the knob order. This was the first time Barbour had\n\nheard a reason for her termination. According to Barbour, she was never made aware of any\n\nerrors with the contact sockets order prior to her termination, or at any time prior to the TWC\n\nhearing. Barbour also testified that she did not make the errors on either the contact socket order\n\nor the chalk knobs work order.\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f       Valerie Dorsette was Barbour’s co-worker in the CaTS assembly area. Barbour testified\n\nthat Dorsette was the assembler on the knob work order and Barbour was only a helper. The\n\n“assembler” on the work order is responsible for confirming that the correct parts have been\n\nprovided and for completing the work order. According to Barbour, she had asked Dorsette\n\nwhether she confirmed that the knob order was correct, and Dorsette stated that she had.\n\n       On April 23, 2007, Barbour filed the instant suit alleging age discrimination. The case\n\nwas tried to a jury. The charge instructed the jury to answer three questions. Question 1 asked:\n\n       Was age a motivating factor in Williams-Pyro, Inc.’s decision to discharge\n       Rhonda Barbour?\n\n       A ‘motivating factor’ in an employment decision is a reason for making the\n       decision at the time it was made. There may be more than one motivating factor\n       for an employment decision.\n\n       Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’\n\nThe jury answered “yes.” Because the jury answered yes to Question 1, the jury was then\n\ninstructed to answer Question 2:\n\n       Would Williams-Pyro, Inc. have taken the same action inquired about in Question\n       1 when it did, in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor, if any?\n\n       Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’\n\nThe jury answered “No.” Finally, the jury was asked to award damages based on their liability\n\ndetermination. In response to Question 3, the jury awarded Barbour $40,000 in damages for\n\nback pay, $10,000 in lost employment benefits, $100,000 in past compensatory damages, and\n\n$100,000 in future compensatory damages. After the jury rendered its verdict, WPI filed a post-\n\ntrial plea to the jurisdiction and a motion to dismiss. Barbour also filed a post-trial motion for\n\nattorney’s fees. On July 19, 2011, the trial court held a hearing. The next day, it signed an order\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\fdenying WPI’s plea to the jurisdiction. That same day it also signed its final judgment. The\n\njudgment stated in relevant part:\n\n       [A] jury, having been empaneled and sworn to try this cause, and after hearing the\n       pleadings, evidence, and argument of counsel, and after the trial court read the\n       Charge of the Court to the jury, the jury did return into open court its verdict, duly\n       signed by ten jurors, and in response to special issues, definitions and explanatory\n       instructions submitted to them by the Court in its Charge, which findings as\n       verdict of the jury were received by the Court and entered into the record and\n       minutes of the docket of said Court, and the Court heard arguments and evidence\n       regarding attorneys fees. The Court does hereby enter its Judgment as follows:\n\n       1. Plaintiff Barbour is hereby entitled to recover damages from the Defendant\n       Williams-Pyro, Inc., in the sum of One Hundred and Twenty Thousand and Seven\n       Hundred Fourteen Dollars and Forty Cents ($120,714.40), which includes. pre-\n       judgment interest that accrued on the award of past compensatory damages of\n       Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), and past lost wages awarded by the Court in\n       the amount of Forty Thousand Dollars, ($40,000.00) and past employment\n       benefits in the amount of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) at the rate of Five\n       percent (5%) per annum, simple interest. Such interest accrued from April 23,\n       2007, the date on which suit was filed in this cause through June 13, 2011.\n\n       2. The Court finds that counsel for the Plaintiff, Jason C.N. Smith and Zoe\n       Courtney, have reputations for providing highly competent, ethical, and qualified\n       legal representation of individuals in employment matters such as this case and\n       that Plaintiff is entitled to recover her reasonable and necessary attorney fees.\n       The Court awards reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and orders Defendant\n       to pay Plaintiff the amount of One Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Three Hundred\n       Thirty-Five Dollars ($154,335.00) in attorneys fees through trial, Thirty Thousand\n       Dollars ($30,000.00) for any appeal to the Court of Appeals in which she prevails,\n       Twelve Thousand Dollars ($12,000.00) for any Petition filed with the Texas\n       Supreme Court in which she prevails and Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) if\n       the Texas Supreme Court requests full briefing in which she prevails.\n\n       On August 29, 2011, the trial court filed two separate sets of findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law. One related to its decision denying WPI’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion\n\nto dismiss and the other related to Barbour’s motion for attorney’s fees. WPI then filed a Motion\n\nfor Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and Alternative Motion for New Trial. On September\n\n26, 2011, the trial court held a hearing to address both motions and on October 19, 2011, the trial\n\ncourt issued an order denying them in their entirety.\n\n                                               -9-\n\f                                        WPI’s APPEAL\n\n       WPI challenges both the factual and legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the\n\njury’s finding that Barbour’s age was a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate her\n\nemployment. It also contends that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case\n\nbecause Barbour failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing suit in district court.\n\nWe will begin by addressing WPI’s jurisdictional argument.\n\n                                   Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       In Issue Three, WPI argues that Barbour failed to properly exhaust her administrative\n\nremedies before filing the instant suit, thereby depriving the trial court and by extension this\n\ncourt of subject matter jurisdiction. Under Texas law, the exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nis a mandatory prerequisite to filing an action under TCHRA, and the failure to exhaust\n\nTCHRA’s administrative remedies deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.             See\n\nHoffmann–La Roche, Inc., v. Zeltwanger, 144 S.W.3d 438, 446 (Tex. 2004); City of Waco v.\n\nLopez, 259 S.W.3d 147, 149, 154 (Tex. 2008). Under TCHRA, the exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies begins when a party files a charge of discrimination with the Texas Workforce\n\nCommission. See TEX.LAB.CODE ANN. § 21.201 (West 2006); Waffle House, Inc. v. Williams,\n\n313 S.W.3d 796, 804 (Tex. 2010).\n\n       Courts construe complaints filed under TCHRA liberally and “look slightly beyond [the]\n\nfour corners, to [the] substance rather than [the] label.” Pacheco v. Mineta, 448 F.3d 783, 789\n\n(5th Cir. 2006). That said, the charge must contain a sufficient factual basis to put the employer\n\non notice of the existence and nature of the charges. Bartosh, 259 S.W.3d at 321, citing Preston\n\nv. Texas Department of Family & Protective Services, 222 F. Appx 353, 356 (5th Cir. 2007)(per\n\ncuriam). “The crucial element of a charge of discrimination is the factual statement contained in\n\n\n\n                                              - 10 -\n\fthe administrative complaint.” Bartosh v. Sam Houston State University, 259 S.W.3d 317, 321\n\n(Tex.App.--Texarkana 2008, pet. denied), quoting Preston, 222 Fed. Appx. at 356 (internal\n\nquotations omitted).   The scope of a suit under TCHRA is limited to the scope of the\n\ninvestigation that “can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.”\n\nPacheco, 448 F.3d at 789, quoting Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 463 (5th Cir.\n\n1970)(internal quotations omitted); Bartosh, 259 S.W.3d at 321. If, by looking to either the\n\nfactual allegations or the checked boxes, a specific type of discrimination claim could reasonably\n\nbe expected to grow out of the allegations in an EEOC charge, then the plaintiff has exhausted\n\nher administrative remedies. See Briggs v. DART Regional Rail Right of Way Co., 2005 WL\n\n3133505 (Nov. 23, 2005 N.D.Tex.). Therefore, Barbour’s claims in the instant suit may only\n\ninclude those claims stated in her administrative complaint, and factually related claims that\n\ncould reasonably be expected to fall within the agency’s investigation of the claims stated in the\n\ncharge. Fine v. GAF Chem. Corp., 995 F.2d 576, 578 (5th Cir.1993); University of Texas v.\n\nPoindexter, 306 S.W.3d 798, 810 (Tex.App.--Austin 2009, no pet.); Thomas v. Clayton Williams\n\nEnergy, Inc., 2 S.W.3d 734, 738 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.).\n\n       Barbour filed an EEOC claim in December 2006. On her sworn charge of discrimination,\n\nBarbour marked the box for “age” as the type of discrimination alleged.           EEOC Form 5\n\nrequested the following information: (1) personal harm; (2) reason for adverse action; and (3)\n\ndiscrimination statement. Barbour completed the “personal harm” section with the following\n\nstatement: “I was terminated from my job on 11/15/06.” She also stated on the form that she\n\nwas told by WPI that they did not need a reason to terminate her. Finally, as her “discrimination\n\nstatement,” Barbour stated that she “believed [she] was terminated because of her age, 44 years\n\nold, in violation of Texas Labor Code, Chapter 21.”\n\n\n\n                                              - 11 -\n\f       After denying WPI’s plea to the jurisdiction, the trial court issued findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law which stated in relevant part:\n\n       21. On February 26, 2007, Rhonda Barbour provided additional information to\n       the Texas Workforce Commission regarding her years of service at Williams-\n       Pyro, Inc. and her excellent work record.\n\n       22. Plaintiff did not allege a hostile work environment claim based on age in her\n       sworn charge of discrimination.\n\n       23. Rhonda Barbour received a Notice of Right to File a Civil Action on\n       February 27,2007.\n\n       On appeal, we must determine whether the allegations in Barbour’s original charge\n\nand/or her subsequent amendment could reasonably give rise to an investigation of her claims of\n\ndiscrimination based on age. See Pacheco, 448 F.3d at 789; Poindexter, 306 S.W.3d at 810;\n\nClayton Williams Energy, 2 S.W.3d at 738. As Barbour’s attorney’s pointed out during the plea\n\nto the jurisdiction hearing, a plaintiff does not have to put down every piece of information that\n\nshe will eventually use at trial on the EEOC form to sufficiently exhaust administrative remedies\n\nunder the statute. Here, Barbour’s EEOC claim alleged sufficient information to put WPI on\n\nnotice of her age discrimination claim. We conclude that Barbour exhausted her administrative\n\nremedies and overrule Issue Three.\n\n                                   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       In Issue One, WPI complains that the evidence is legally insufficient to prove that age\n\nwas a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate Barbour because there is no evidence\n\nthat: (1) WPI treated Barbour less favorably than similarly situated WPI employees of the\n\nopposing class; and (2) WPI’s proffered reasons for terminating Barbour were pretext for\n\ndiscrimination. Appellant also contends that, “Montalvo’s alleged workplace remarks are not\n\nevidence of pretext or that WPI terminated Barbour because of her age.” Alternatively, in Issue\n\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\fTwo, WPI argues that evidence is factually insufficient to support the finding that Barbour’s age\n\nwas a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate Barbour’s employment.\n\n       In conducting a legal sufficiency review, we view all evidence in a light most favorable\n\nto the prevailing party, indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the judgment. Bradford\n\nv. Vento, 48 S.W.3d 749, 754 (Tex. 2001). However, if the evidence allows for only one\n\ninference, neither the jurors nor a reviewing court may disregard it. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168\n\nS.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex. 2005); Contreras v. Bennett, 361 S.W.3d 174, 179 (Tex.App.--El Paso\n\n2011, no pet.)(noting same standards). So long as more than a scintilla of evidence supports the\n\nfinding below, we will uphold it and the legal sufficiency challenge will fail. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc. v. Canchola, 121 S.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex. 2003); Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye, 907\n\nS.W.2d 497, 499 (Tex. 1995). Additionally, we must remember that the jurors are the sole\n\njudges of the weight and credibility of witness testimony, and if the evidence at trial would allow\n\nreasonable, fair-minded jurors to differ in their conclusions, then a reviewing court must allow\n\njurors to do so. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 810; El Paso Independent School District v.\n\nPabon, 214 S.W.3d 37, 41 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.). Accordingly, so long as evidence\n\nfalls within the zone of reasonable disagreement, a reviewing court cannot substitute its own\n\njudgment for that of the trier of fact. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819; Pabon, 214 S.W.3d at\n\n41.\n\n       In a factual sufficiency review, we examine all the evidence in the record, both for and\n\nagainst the lower court’s findings. Ortiz v. Jones, 917 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996); Newberry\n\nv. Newberry, 351 S.W.3d 552, 555-56 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2011, no pet.). We must consider and\n\nweigh all such evidence in a neutral light. Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d\n\n757, 761 (Tex. 2003). We will reverse only if we conclude “that the verdict is so against the\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\fgreat weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust--this, regardless of\n\nwhether the record contains some evidence of probative force in support of the verdict.” Id.\n\n           Barbour sued WPI under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA) See\n\nTEX.LAB.CODE ANN. § 21.051. An employer is prohibited from discharging, or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against, an employee because of the employee’s age.5 See TEX.LAB.CODE ANN. §\n\n21.051; Canchola, 121 S.W.3d at 739. One of the purposes of TCHRA is to “provide for the\n\nexecution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” TEX.LAB.CODE ANN. §\n\n21.001(1).        In interpreting TCHRA, the Texas Supreme Court has consistently looked to\n\nanalogous federal statutes and the cases interpreting them for guidance.                               See Mission\n\nConsolidated Independent School District v. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d 629, 633-34 (Tex. 2012), citing\n\nQuantum Chem. Corp. v. Toennies, 47 S.W.3d 473, 476 (Tex. 2001) and NME Hosps., Inc. v.\n\nRennels, 994 S.W.2d 142, 144 (Tex. 1999).\n\n           Texas courts follow the approach set forth by the United States Supreme Court and\n\nrecognize two alternative methods of proof in discriminatory treatment cases. Mission Consol.\n\n372 S.W.3d at 634, citing Quantum Chem., 47 S.W.3d at 476. Under the first method, a plaintiff\n\nproves discriminatory intent via direct evidence. Mission Consol., 372 S.W.3d at 634. “Direct\n\nevidence is evidence that, if believed, proves the fact of discriminatory animus without inference\n\n5\n    In its entirety, Section 21.051, titled, “Discrimination by Employer” states:\n\n           An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability,\n           religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n           (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other\n           manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or\n           privileges of employment; or\n\n           (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment in a manner that\n           would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect\n           in any other manner the status of an employee.\n\nTEX.LAB.CODE ANN. § 21.051.\n\n\n                                                          - 14 -\n\for presumption.” Sandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc., 309 F.3d 893, 897 (5th Cir. 2002).\n\nHowever, it is often difficult to prove “forbidden animus” through direct evidence. See Mission\n\nConsol., 372 S.W.3d at 634 (recognizing that: “motives are often more covert than overt, making\n\ndirect evidence of forbidden animus hard to come by”) and U.S. Postal Service Board of\n\nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983)(noting that there\n\nwill seldom be an eyewitness who can testify as to the employer’s mental processes and\n\ntherefore recognizing the difficultly in using direct evidence to prove the “state of a man’s mind\n\nat a particular time”). In order to ease the burden on discrimination plaintiffs, the court created a\n\nsecond method of proof. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817,\n\n36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); Mission Consol., 372 S.W.3d at 634. Accordingly, when there is no\n\ndirect evidence of discriminatory intent, discrimination can be shown indirectly through a\n\nburden-shifting method of proof. See McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 801-03; 93 S.Ct. at\n\n1820; Mission Consol., 372 S.W.3d at 634. Under this second method, the plaintiff must first\n\nmake a prima facie case showing that the plaintiff: (1) was discharged; (2) was qualified for the\n\nposition from which she was discharged; (3) is a member of a protected class; and (4) was either\n\nreplaced by someone outside the protected class, replaced by someone younger, or was otherwise\n\ndischarged because of her age. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 801-03, 93 S.Ct. at 1820.\n\nSo long as a plaintiff meets the “minimal” initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination, she is entitled to a presumption of discrimination (the “McDonnell Douglas\n\npresumption”). Mission Consol., 372 S.W.3d at 634, citing Texas Department of Community\n\nAffairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) and Canchola, 121\n\nS.W.3d at 739. “Although the precise elements of this showing will vary depending on the\n\ncircumstances, the plaintiff’s burden at this stage of the case is not onerous.” Mission Consol.,\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f372 S.W.3d at 634, quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089 (internal quotations\n\nomitted). Once the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to\n\ndemonstrate a legitimate nondiscriminatory purpose for the employment action. McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1824. If the defendant meets this burden, then the\n\nplaintiff must prove that the employer’s stated reason for the adverse action was merely pretext\n\nfor the real, discriminatory purpose. Id. However, where, as here, the case has been fully tried\n\non the merits, we do not engage in the burden-shifting analysis. Canchola, 121 S.W.3d at 739;\n\nClaymex Brick and Tile, Inc. v. Garza, 216 S.W.3d 33, 36 (Tex.App.--San Antonio 2006, no\n\npet.). “Instead, the evaluation process is streamlined and we proceed directly to whether the\n\nplaintiff presented enough evidence for a jury to find that discrimination occurred.” Claymex\n\nBrick and Tile, Inc., 216 S.W.3d at 36, citing Cachola, 121 S.W.3d at 739; see also City of\n\nAustin Police Department v. Brown, 96 S.W.3d 588, 596 (Tex.App.--Austin 2002, pet.\n\ndism’d)(noting that “an affirmative finding will be reviewed on appeal on the basis of whether\n\nthe plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for the jury to find discrimination had occurred.”).\n\nTherefore, in addressing WPI’s first two issues, our inquiry is limited to whether the evidence is\n\nlegally and/or factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding that age was a motivating factor in\n\nWPI’s decision to terminate Barbour.6 See Canchola, 121 S.W.3d at 739.\n\n        A significant portion of WPI’s argument is dedicated to the assertion that Barbour\n\npresented no evidence regarding the treatment of similarly situated employees. It thus contends\n\nthat Barbour failed to establish the fourth element of a prima facie case of discrimination. In\n\nsupport of this argument, WPI relies heavily on the Supreme Court’s opinion in AutoZone, Inc. v.\n\nReyes, 272 S.W.3d 588 (Tex. 2008)(per curiam).\n\n6\n  At trial, Barbour bore the burden of establishing discriminatory intent. Canchola, 121 S.W.3d at 739. In other\nwords, it was Barbour’s burden to prove that her age was a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate her.\n\n\n                                                    - 16 -\n\f       In AutoZone, Salvador Reyes sued his employer, alleging he was fired because of his age\n\nin violation of TCHRA. AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 590. Reyes was sixty-two years old when his\n\nemployment was terminated. Id. His employer responded alleging that Reyes was fired for\n\nsexually harassing a female coworker. Id. A jury found in favor of Reyes and the Corpus Christi\n\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. Id.; see AutoZone, Inc. v. Reyes, 272 S.W.3d 644, 648 (Tex.App.--\n\nCorpus Christi 2006), rev’d, 272 S.W.3d 588 (Tex. 2008)(per curiam). The Texas Supreme\n\nCourt agreed with the employer that the evidence supporting the finding that age was a\n\nmotivating factor in Reyes’s discharge was legally insufficient and reversed the Court of\n\nAppeals. AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 591. WPI focuses on the Supreme Court’s holding in\n\nAutoZone that the evidence failed to establish that the employer subjected the plaintiff to\n\ndisparate discipline and “discriminated against [him] by treating him less favorably than\n\nsimilarly-situated younger employees” who violated the company’s sexual harassment policy.\n\nAutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 593-95. However, this was just a small portion of the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision. WPI ignores the fact that under the very standard used in AutoZone, Barbour presented\n\nsufficient direct evidence of discriminatory animus.\n\n       The court’s analysis in AutoZone began by discussing whether remarks made by a store\n\nmanager constituted evidence of discrimination. Id. at 593-94. The employer argued that\n\nstatements made to a parts service manager by a store manager that the employer intended to get\n\nrid of “the old people” were “stray remarks” made by an individual who was not part of and had\n\nno input into the decision to fire Reyes.       Id. at 592.   The Supreme Court specifically\n\nacknowledged that “remarks and statements may serve as evidence of discrimination,” if they\n\nare: (1) related to the employee’s protected class, (2) close in time to the employment decision,\n\n(3) made by an individual with authority over the employment decision, and (4) related to the\n\n\n\n                                              - 17 -\n\femployment decision at issue. [Emphasis added]. Id. at 593. The court concluded that the\n\nevidence showed the store manager played no part in, had no leverage over, and exerted no\n\ninfluence concerning the employer’s investigation or decision to fire the plaintiff.7 Id. The\n\nSupreme Court also determined that no person involved in the investigation or subsequent\n\ntermination decision ever spoke to or took a statement from the store manager, that the store\n\nmanager “did not work in the store where the sexual harassment allegedly occurred,” that the\n\nstore manager had no authority over the plaintiff until the plaintiff was transferred to the\n\nmanager’s store while the harassment allegation was being investigated, and that the store\n\nmanager testified at the trial that he had no involvement in the investigation or termination\n\ndecision. Id. With respect to the store manager’s “get rid of ‘the old people’” statements, the\n\nSupreme Court found no evidence that the manager represented the employer’s motive or intent.8\n\nId. at 592.\n\n        The instant case is distinguishable. There was testimony that Montalvo made comments\n\nto Barbour that she was getting “old,” about her having “gray hair,” and about her “sagging\n\nbreasts,” and such comments were clearly related to Barbour’s age, and because Barbour was\n\nover forty, they were related to her “protected class.” Barbour also testified that Montalvo made\n\nthese comments “nonstop,” “three or four times a week” and “all the time,” up until her\n\ntermination. Since Barbour’s alleged adverse employment action was her termination, these\n\ncomments were certainly made in “proximate time to the adverse employment decision.” In\n\naddition, Barbour testified that Montalvo made comments that the company “need[ed] to hire\n\n\n7\n  The termination decision was made by a regional manager on the basis of a recommendation made by a company\nemployee relations specialist who had reviewed written statements obtained from the plaintiff, the coworker that\nwas allegedly harassed by the plaintiff, and other employees. AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 591.\n8\n  The court also noted that at trial the store manager (who no longer worked for the employer) testified that he was\nonly communicating his personal opinion that the employer was attempting to remove long-time managers who\nwere not following the employer’s policies. AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 592-93.\n\n                                                      - 18 -\n\fyoung Mexican girls.” Montalvo’s comments regarding Barbour’s age and the need for “young\n\nMexican girls” is “related to the employment decision at issue.” Therefore, the only remaining\n\nquestion is whether Montalvo was an individual with authority over the employment decision at\n\nissue - i.e. Barbour’s termination. AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 593; Burton v. Carter Bloodcare,\n\n2012 WL 42899, *7 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth Jan. 5, 2012, no pet.). In contrast to AutoZone, there\n\nis sufficient evidence in this case to show that Montalvo possessed leverage over, and exerted\n\ninfluence over, WPI’s decision to terminate Barbour.\n\n       “In determining whether the individual making the remark had authority over the\n\nemployment decision, consideration is not limited to statements by the person who officially\n\nmade the decision.” AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 593, citing Arismendez v. Nightingale Home\n\nHealth Care, Inc., 493 F.3d 602, 608 (5th Cir. 2007) and Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Venture,\n\n235 F.3d 219, 226-27 (5th Cir. 2000). Even if the person who made the comments is not the\n\ndecision maker, if the evidence shows that person possessed leverage or exerted influence over\n\nthe decision-maker, then the discriminatory animus may be imputed to an employer. AutoZone,\n\n272 S.W.3d at 593, citing Russell, 235 F.3d at 226-27.\n\n       It is undisputed that Montalvo was WPI’s production manager and that as such, he was\n\nresponsible for personnel issues. Montalvo, Paul Shiller, and Candace Woodard were the only\n\npeople present when Barbour was terminated. Montalvo was the only one who spoke and the\n\none who actually informed Barbour she was fired.\n\n       There is also sufficient evidence showing that even if Montalvo was not directly\n\nresponsible for the decision to terminate Barbour, he influenced the decision. WPI points to\n\ntestimony that Della Williams was the one who made the decision to terminate Barbour, and that\n\nsince Mrs. Williams was unaware of any comments made by Montalvo, there is no evidence of\n\n\n\n                                             - 19 -\n\fdiscriminatory intent. But Montalvo himself testified that Mrs. Williams was not involved in the\n\ndecision to terminate Barbour. The jury was free to disbelieve the testimony that Mrs. Williams\n\nalone made the termination decision.\n\n        Therefore, while a lack of evidence regarding the treatment of similarly situated\n\nemployees could prevent Barbour from enjoying the benefit of the prima facie presumption, it\n\ndoes not preclude the possibility that Barbour presented sufficient direct evidence to show that\n\nage was a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate her. We find that Barbour presented\n\nsuch direct evidence of discriminatory intent via Montalvo’s comments.9\n\n        Here, WPI asserted it Barbour was terminated for multiple reasons. First, WPI points to\n\nevidence that it fired Barbour based on two complaints from Barbour’s “Line Lead,” Tammy\n\nRenteria, that Barbour failed to follow written work orders. In addition, WPI points to the\n\ntestimony of Della Williams wherein Ms. Williams stated that Barbour (1) had “missed a lot of\n\nwork”; and (2) “had had a lot of conflict with a lot of different employees in the organization.”\n\nHowever, all of the testimony supporting these contentions was directly contested by Barbour.\n\nAs the judges of witness credibility and demeanor, the jury was free to believe or disbelieve the\n\ntestimony.\n\n        We conclude that the evidence presented would allow a reasonable and fair-minded jury\n\nto find that Barbour’s age was a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate her. Likewise,\n\nthe jury’s finding cannot be said to be so against the great weight of the evidence as to be clearly\n\nwrong or unjust. Issues One and Two are overruled.\n\n\n\n9\n   We acknowledge that the fact Barbour presented direct evidence of discriminatory intent did not automatically\nrequire a verdict in her favor. “[T]he existence of direct evidence only shifted the burdens of production and\npersuasion to [WPI] to show that it would have made the same employment decision regardless of [Barbour’s] age.”\nSee Brown, 96 S.W.3d at 599 n.5, citing Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 244-45, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104\nL.Ed.2d 268 (1989). Based on the jury’s verdict, they failed to find that WPI would have done so.\n\n\n                                                    - 20 -\n\f                                BARBOUR’S CROSS APPEAL\n\n       We now turn to Barbour’s cross-appeal. In a single issue, Barbour argues that the trial\n\ncourt erred by concluding that it lacked authority to enhance the amount of attorney’s fees\n\nawarded to Barbour.\n\n       The parties agreed (pretrial) that, whatever the outcome, the trial court would determine\n\nthe attorney’s fee award. After the jury returned its verdict in favor of Barbour, Barbour filed a\n\nMotion for Attorney’s Fees.      In her motion, Barbour requested that the trial court award\n\nattorneys’ fees through trial and post-verdict proceedings, as well as appellate attorney fees.\n\nBarbour also requested an enhancement of the base fee for both trial fees and any appellate fees.\n\nSpecifically, Barbour requested that the trial court apply a multiplier of two (2) in determining\n\nreasonable attorneys’ fees. WPI filed a response and objections to Barbour’s motion.\n\n       On July 19, 2011, the trial court held a hearing on attorney’s fees. The following day, the\n\ntrial court issued its judgment awarding Barbour “reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees” in\n\nthe amount of $154,335. WPI requested findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial\n\ncourt’s findings of fact included findings that: (1) Barbour’s attorneys spent a total of 545 hours\n\nand 45 minutes on Barbour’s case (through the jury trial and post-verdict hearings and briefings);\n\nand (2) 514 hours and 45 minutes was a reasonable and necessary amount of hours. The trial\n\ncourt also found the reasonable hourly rates for Barbour’s attorneys were: (1) $300 per hour for\n\nJason Smith; (2) $300 an hour for Zoe Courtney; and (3) $200 an hour for John Brender. The\n\ntrial court then stated a number of findings detailing the qualifications of the attorneys.\n\nFollowing such statements, the court, in finding of fact number 32, stated:\n\n       The Court finds that Rhonda Barbour’s reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees\n       through the trial of this case and for post verdict hearings and briefing\n       are One Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Five Dollars\n\n\n\n                                              - 21 -\n\f         ($154,335.00).10\n\nIn its conclusions of law, the trial court specifically stated that Barbour should recover attorneys’\n\nfees in the amount of $154,335. On appeal, Barbour challenges only the trial court’s final\n\nconclusion of law stating:\n\n         The Court concludes that it is not authorized to utilize a multiplier in awarding\n         attorneys’ fees under Chapter 21.259, but finds that a 1.5 multiplier would be\n         appropriate if an appellate court concludes otherwise.\n\nBarbour argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law by concluding that it did not have the\n\nauthority under Texas Labor Code Section 21.259 to apply a multiplier to enhance the amount of\n\nattorney’s fees in an age discrimination case. Accordingly, Barbour asks us to render judgment\n\napplying a 1.5 multiplier to the attorneys’ fee award.\n\n                                              Standard of Review\n\n         We review challenges to a trial court’s conclusions of law de novo. Hitzelberger v.\n\nSamedan Oil Corp., 948 S.W.2d 497, 503 (Tex.App.--Waco 1997, pet. denied); Piazza v. City of\n\nGranger, 909 S.W.2d 529 (Tex.App.--Austin 1995, no writ.).\n\n                                                 Applicable Law\n\n         Under Section 21.259(a) of the Texas Labor Code, a prevailing party is entitled to\n\nrecover reasonable attorney’s fees as “part of the costs.” See TEX.LAB.CODE ANN. §21.259(a).\n\nIn a suit brought under Texas law, the method of assessing and awarding attorney fees is\n\ngoverned by Texas procedural rules. State v. Anderson Courier Service, 222 S.W.3d 62, 67\n\n(Tex.App.--Austin 2005, pet. denied); Dillard Department Stores, Inc. v. Gonzales, 72 S.W.3d\n\n398, 413 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2002, pet. denied). For suits brought under Section 21.259(a) of\n\n10\n    In its final three findings of fact (numbers 33-35), the trial court found: (1) should Barbour prevail on appeal,\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees would be $30,000; (2) if the matter is further appealed by petition of review\nto the Supreme Court, reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees would be $12,000; and (3) if the Supreme Court\ngrants Barbour’s petition for review, reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees would be an additional $30,000, “in\nthe event she should prevail.”\n\n                                                       - 22 -\n\fTCHRA, Texas courts have adopted the “lodestar” method for calculating the amount of fees to\n\naward.11 See, e.g., Dillard Department Stores, Inc. v. Gonzales, 72 S.W.3d 398, 412 (Tex.App.--\n\nEl Paso 2002, pet. denied); West Telemarketing Corporation Outbound v. McClure, 225 S.W.3d\n\n658, 675-76 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2006, pet. granted, judgm’t vacated w.r.m.).\n\n        In El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757 (Tex. 2012), the Texas Supreme Court\n\nexplained that determining what constitutes a reasonable fee under the lodestar method is a two-\n\nstep process. El Apple I, Ltd, 370 S.W.3d at 759. In step one, the court determines the\n\nreasonable number of hours spent by counsel on the case and a reasonable hourly rate for the\n\nwork performed. Id. The court then multiplies the number of hours reasonably expended by the\n\nreasonable hourly rate to arrive at the lodestar. Id. In step two, the court considers whether\n\ncertain factors merit an upward or downward adjustment of the lodestar in order to reach a\n\nreasonable fee award. Id.\n\n        In setting forth this process, the court acknowledged and accepted the presumption that\n\nthe lodestar produces a reasonable fee. El Apple I, Ltd., 370 S.W.3d at 759. However, it\n\nrecognized that “exceptional circumstances may justify enhancements to the base lodestar” Id.\n\nIn other words, once the base lodestar has been calculated, a court may raise or lower the\n\nlodestar amount if certain relevant factors indicate an adjustment is necessary.\n\n        The relevant factors the court may consider in determining whether an adjustment is\n\n\n11\n    The remedies provided under TCHRA mirror those available under those available in federal employment\ndiscrimination law. Compare TEX.LAB.CODE ANN. §§ 21.258, 21.2585, 21.259(a) with 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981a, 2000e-\n5(g), 2000e-5(k). As noted above, one purpose of TCHRA is to harmonize state and federal employment\ndiscrimination law. TEX.LAB.CODE ANN. § 21.001(1). Therefore, while state procedural rules govern the\ndetermination of attorney’s fees in a suit brought under state law, Texas courts have looked to federal law in\napplying Section 21.259(a) of TCHRA. See, e.g., Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc. v. Franco, 971 S.W.2d 52,\n55-56 (Tex. 1998); Burgmann Seals America, Inc. v. Cadenhead, 135 S.W.3d 854, 860-61 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st\nDist.] 2004, pet. denied); Elgaghil v. Tarrant County Junior College, 45 S.W.3d 133, 144-45 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth\n2000, pet. denied). Federal courts use the lodestar method in awarding attorney’s fees. See, e.g., Dillard\nDepartmentt Stores, Inc. v. Gonzales, 72 S.W.3d 398, 412 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2002, pet. denied); West\nTelemarketing Corp. Outbound, 225 S.W.3d at 675-76.\n\n                                                     - 23 -\n\fnecessary are found in the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. Such factors\n\ninclude: (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and\n\nthe skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood, if apparent to the\n\nclient, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the\n\nlawyer; (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount\n\ninvolved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the\n\ncircumstances; (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; (7) the\n\nexperience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and (8)\n\nwhether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or uncertainty of collection before the\n\nlegal services have been rendered. El Apple I, Ltd., 370 S.W.3d at 761.\n\n       These factors mirror those set out by the Fifth Circuit in Johnson v. Georgia Highway\n\nExpress, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974), overruled on other grounds by Blanchard v.\n\nBergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 109 S.Ct. 939, 103 L.Ed.2d 67 (1989). In Johnson, the Fifth Circuit\n\nexplained that the lodestar may not be adjusted due to a Johnson factor if that factor was already\n\nconsidered in determining the base lodestar amount. Johnson, 488 S.W.2d at 717-19; see also\n\nDillard Department Stores, Inc., 72 S.W.3d at 412 (noting that if some of the Johnson factors are\n\naccounted for in the lodestar amount, they should not be considered when making adjustments).\n\nIn addition, the United States Supreme Court has explained that while a lodestar may be\n\nadjusted, such adjustments are appropriate only in “rare circumstances.” Perdue v. Kenny A, 559\n\nU.S. 542, 130 S.Ct. 1662, 1673, 176 L.Ed.2d 494 (2010). The court went on to state that the\n\n“lodestar figure [already] includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a\n\n‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee.” Id.\n\n       In calculating attorney’s fees under lodestar, the party applying for the award bears “the\n\n\n\n                                              - 24 -\n\fburden of documenting the hours expended on the litigation and the value of those hours.” See\n\nEl Apple I., 370 S.W.3d at 761, citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933,\n\n76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Generally, an attorney meets this burden by providing documentation\n\nevidencing the time expended on the case and reasonable hourly rates. In calculating an award,\n\nthe trial court should obtain sufficient information to make a meaningful evaluation of the\n\napplication for attorney’s fees, and should exclude charges for duplicative, excessive, or\n\ninadequately documented work. Watkins v. Fordice, 7 F.3d 453, 457 (5th Cir. 1993). Generally,\n\nthe award of attorney’s fees is within the trial court’s sound discretion. See El Apple I., 370\n\nS.W.3d at 761, citing Ragsdale v. Progressive Voters League, 801 S.W.2d 880, 881 (Tex.\n\n1990)(per curiam).\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n       Barbour does not specifically challenge the trial court’s judgment awarding “reasonable\n\nand necessary” attorney’s fees in the amount of $154,335, nor does she challenge the trial court’s\n\nfindings of fact that such amount is “reasonable and necessary.” She does not argue that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in calculating the amount of the award, or otherwise assert a challenge\n\nto the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court’s award. Instead, she contends that\n\nthe trial court erred as a matter of law by concluding that it was not authorized to utilize a\n\nmultiplier in awarding attorney’s fees under Section 21.259.          Barbour relies on the Texas\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in El Apple I and argues that it confirms that the trial court below\n\nerred in concluding that it was not authorized to utilize a multiplier.\n\n       While El Apple acknowledges that a multiplier may be applied to the lodestar amount in\n\ncases filed under the Texas Labor Code, it specified that only “exceptional circumstances may\n\njustify enhancements to the base lodestar.” El Apple I, Ltd., 370 S.W.3d at 760. To justify\n\n\n\n                                                - 25 -\n\fadjusting the lodestar figure, the court must rely on factors such as the complexity of the case,\n\nthe skill of the attorney, whether the fee is contingent, and the novelty of the issues raised. The\n\nproblem here is that the findings of fact indicate that the trial court relied on each one of these\n\nfactors in determining the lodestar. Barbour does not point to any additional evidence indicating\n\nexceptional circumstances existed which would warrant utilization of a multiplier. Likewise, we\n\ndo not find any indication that Barbour’s counsel ever identified which factors supported the use\n\nof a multiplier, separate and distinct from those use to calculate the base lodestar.\n\n       The trial court specifically and repeatedly referred to the fees awarded as “reasonable and\n\nnecessary.” Under Texas law, that is all the trial court is authorized to award. Finding no error,\n\nwe overrule Barbour’s sole point and affirm the judgment.\n\n\nMarch 20, 2013\n                                       ANN CRAWFORD McCLURE, Chief Justice\n\nBefore McClure, C.J., Rivera, and Antcliff, JJ.\nAntcliff, J., not participating\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 26 -\n\f",

(WPI) for age\n\ndiscrimination under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act. A jury found in favor of\n\nBarbour and awarded her $40,000 in damages for back pay, $10,000 in lost employment\n\nbenefits, $100,000 in past compensatory damages, and $100,000 in future compensatory\n\ndamages. The trial court determined that the statutory caps required under Texas Labor Code\n\nSection 21.2585(d)(1) should be applied to the jury’s award of damages and rendered judgment\n\nfor Barbour in the amount of $120,714, exclusive of attorney’s fees and costs. Based on a prior\n\nagreement between the parties, the trial court then addressed Barbour’s claim for attorney’s fees.\n\nIn her claim for attorney’s fees, Barbour asked the court to apply a multiplier to enhance her fee\n\naward. After the hearing, the trial court determined that Barbour was entitled to attorney’s fees\n\nin the amount of $154,335, but concluded that it did not possess the authority under Section\n\f21.259 of the Texas Labor Code to apply a multiplier. The court specifically ruled that if did\n\nhave such authority, a 1.5 multiplier was appropriate.\n\n       WPI then filed the instant appeal. It challenges the trial court’s judgment, complaining\n\nthat: (1) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s verdict that age\n\nwas a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate Barbour, and (2) that the trial court\n\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Barbour’s discrimination case because she failed to fully\n\nexhaust her administrative remedies before filing suit. Barbour also appeals, contending that the\n\ntrial court erred by not applying a multiplier to her attorney’s fee award. For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we affirm the judgment in its entirety.\n\n                                    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n\n       WPI develops and manufactures products for various industries involved in oil and gas\n\ndevelopment, fire suppression, aeronautics, and national defense. In 1988, Bob Williams hired\n\ntwenty-six year old Rhonda Barbour to work at WPI. Mr. Williams was the co-founder of WPI\n\nand, at the time he hired Barbour, he was also WPI’s president and CEO. When Mr. Williams\n\nhired Barbour he was looking to expand WPI’s business to include a new line of fire\n\nextinguishers or fire suppression devices.        He personally trained Barbour to assemble the\n\nproducts on the new fire extinguisher/suppression line. More specifically, Mr. Williams taught\n\nBarbour to assemble the “charge caps” for WPI’s fire-suppression product known as the\n\n“StoveTop FireStop.” The assembly of the charge caps involved the use of a dangerous and\n\nexplosive chemical called lead styphnate. The government considers lead styphnate to be an\n\nexplosive and therefore heavily regulates its use. Accordingly, because of the dangers involved,\n\nthe charge caps were assembled in a specific room, separated from the rest of WPI’s business.\n\nDealing with these explosives also required Barbour to possess a special set of skills.\n\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f        About a year after Barbour was hired, WPI established a specific assembly line for the\n\nsole purpose of manufacturing the fire suppression devices. The line was referred to as the “pyro\n\nline.” Barbour was the supervisor of the pyro-line and she was responsible for training the new\n\nemployees.1\n\n        In 1996, Mr. Williams passed away and his wife, Della Williams, took over as President\n\nand CEO of WPI.2 According to Mrs. Williams, handling the lead styphnate was the most\n\ndangerous aspect of WPI’s operation. She also acknowledged that the very existence of the pyro\n\nline depended upon Barbour building the charge caps.\n\n        Barbour continued her work assembling charge caps for the fire suppression devices for\n\nher first seventeen years as a WPI employee. James Craig Walters supervised Barbour from\n\n1998 to 2004. He testified that Barbour:\n\n        [C]could use some improvement because she is quick to talk about people behind\n        their back and stir up criticism pools with other employees. I addressed this\n        problem with her and she said it was from being frustrated but in the end she\n        agreed to stop.\n\nAccording to Walters, on Barbour’s 2003 work performance review he specifically noted that\n\nthere were improvements he wanted to see. Barbour was good at “repetitive tasks,” but that she\n\nwas not good at tasks that involved change. Although Walters did not recall ever giving Barbour\n\na written warning, he testified that he spoke with her on several occasions regarding her\n\nbehavior. He considered these discussions oral reprimands or warnings.\n\n        In 2005, the company completed development on a safer alternative to the charge caps,\n\nwhich did not involve the use of explosives. This new design no longer required Barbour’s\n\n1\n  Sally Espinoza was also a supervisor on the pyro line. Espinosa testified that Barbour was a good employee and a\nhard worker. She also testified that Barbour was easy to get along with and that she never observed any combative\nbehavior by Barbour.\n2\n  At the time Mrs. Williams took over control and ownership of the company WPI had nine employees. By the time\nof trial (May 2011), WPI employed ninety-nine employees.\n\n\n                                                      -3-\n\fspecialized skills, nor did it require the assembly to occur in an isolated environment. According\n\nto Mrs. Williams, as the new design was implemented, the old method of using lead styphnate\n\nwas phased out. Likewise, Barbour’s position was effectively phased out.\n\n          Barbour was then re-assigned to the “connectivity and test systems” (CaTS) assembly\n\nline.3 The CaTS assembly area included both mechanical and electrical assembly. Although\n\nBarbour had previously spent the majority of her time working on the pyro assembly line, she\n\nhad worked on both the electrical and mechanical assembly lines from time to time as needed.\n\n          Employees in the CaTS assembly area each had work orders, or written instructions, at\n\ntheir work stations describing the device(s) being assembled. Once a work order was complete,\n\nit was reviewed by the WPI Quality Assurance Department. The Quality Assurance Department\n\nwould check each work order and return any orders containing errors.\n\n          Tammy Renteria, a CaTS assembly leader, testified that an assembly leader also had a\n\nduty to go from station to station along the CaTS assembly line, double-check each assembler’s\n\nwork, and see whether the assemblers had any questions or otherwise needed work orders or\n\nparts for assembly.\n\n          When Barbour began working on the CaTS assembly line, her supervisor was Stacy\n\nChapa. Chapa supervised Barbour from June 2005 to December 2005, during which Barbour\n\nreceived two positive performance evaluations. The first performance evaluation was signed by\n\nPaul Shiller, WPI’s Operations Manager, and gave Barbour a “good” rating.                 The second\n\nperformance evaluation, signed by Vice President Brent Williams, included the following\n\ncomments regarding Barbour’s performance:                     (1) “tracks and completes assigned work\n\nindependently after initial instructions and feedback;” (2) “positive and supportive of the\n\n\n3\n    At the time she was re-assigned in 2005, Barbour was 42 years old.\n\n\n                                                        -4-\n\fcompany’s mission;” (3) “knows the status of tasks the standards for accuracy and quantity;” (4)\n\n“exhibits patience with customers/co-workers;” (5) “maintains courteous and cooperative\n\nrelationships with supervisor and co-workers;” and (6) “accepts supervision, change and\n\nfeedback.” Based on this evaluation, Barbour received a pay raise. Chapa testified that as of\n\nDecember 2005, she had worked with Barbour for seventeen years and never had any problems\n\nwith her.\n\n          Jose “Joe” Montalvo began working at WPI in 2004 as a Quality Inspector. He was later\n\npromoted to supervisor of the Quality Inspection area (or Quality Assurance Department). At\n\nthe time Barbour was reassigned to the CaTS assembly line in 2005, Montalvo was the\n\nsupervisor in charge of the quality inspection area. In April or May 2006, Montalvo became the\n\nproduction manager for the CaTS assembly area.4                       As production manager, Montalvo also\n\nbecame Barbour’s direct supervisor.\n\n          According to Barbour, in 2005 Montalvo began making age-related comments to her. He\n\nmade comments about her gray hair and told her that she was getting old and looking old. He\n\nalso suggested that she color her hair, stating that if she were his wife, she would not look like\n\nshe did. On occasions when she was in the inventory room and would have to bend over,\n\nMontalvo would tell her that her butt was getting big and that she was looking old. Montalvo\n\neventually mentioned replacing Barbour with “young Mexican girls.”                      Barbour said these\n\ncomments were made three or four times a week. She also testified that Montalvo’s tone was\n\nserious and that his comments made her scared and sick.\n\n          Once Montalvo became her direct supervisor on the CaTS assembly line, he continued to\n\nmake comments about her age. At that point, Barbour decided to report the comments to Paul\n\n\n4\n    This was the first time Montalvo had been Barbour’s supervisor.\n\n\n                                                        -5-\n\fShiller, the Operations Manager. According to Barbour, in May or June 2006, she reported\n\nMontalvo’s behavior to Shiller. She told Shiller, in detail, about all of Montalvo’s age-related\n\ncomments. Montalvo admitted making some comments related to the color of Barbour’s hair but\n\nsaid he was only joking.\n\n       Shiller acknowledged that Barbour came to him regarding Montalvo’s comments but she\n\nmentioned them casually and never described them with any specificity. Shiller questioned\n\nMontalvo about the comments, but that conversation was the end of the matter.             Shiller\n\nacknowledged that under WPI’s policy, a complaint of discrimination should have been reported\n\nto Human Resources for investigation. But admittedly, he never reported the comments to\n\nHuman Resources and the claim was not investigated. Sally Espinosa, a former supervisor at\n\nWPI, testified that she heard Montalvo tell Barbour that she was getting too old and fat and that\n\nWPI needed to hire younger girls. Martha Thomas, a CaTS assembly line worker, also testified\n\nregarding Montalvo’s behavior. According to Thomas, things changed when Montalvo became\n\nsupervisor of the CaTS assembly line. She believed Montalvo was trying to get her to resign,\n\nwhich she did in 2008.\n\n       Mr. Walters, Barbour’s supervisor from 1998 to 2004, testified that he observed Barbour\n\ninteracting with Montalvo but he never heard Montalvo make derogatory comments toward\n\nBarbour.\n\n       Mrs. Williams, owner of WPI, testified that she was never informed about Barbour’s\n\ncomplaints regarding Montalvo. She found the comments offensive and they should have been\n\nreported to the Human Resources Department. According to her, even jokes about age should be\n\nreported to Human Resources. On November 15, 2006, WPI terminated Barbour’s employment.\n\nThe only people in the room were Montalvo, Shiller, and Candace Woodard from Human\n\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\fResources. Montalvo did all the talking. Barbour was not given a reason for her termination.\n\nBarbour asked to speak to Mrs. Williams or her son, Brent Williams, but was told by Montalvo\n\nthat they “had already been informed.” Montalvo admitted that he never gave Barbour a written\n\nreprimand prior to terminating her. He also admitted that he generally gives an employee an oral\n\nwarning and a written reprimand before terminating that employee, and that he had given other\n\nemployees written warnings if they had done something “really wrong.”               According to\n\nMontalvo, he had orally reprimanded Barbour at some point, but Barbour testified that she never\n\nreceived a verbal warning while for WPI. No written reprimands appear in Barbour’s file.\n\n                                  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          On December 13, 2006, Barbour filed an administrative complaint with the Texas\n\nWorkforce Commission (TWC) alleging age discrimination as the reason for her termination.\n\nTWC forwarded Barbour’s complaint to WPI on December 22, 2006.                 After investigating\n\nBarbour’s discrimination claims, the TWC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Right to File a Civil\n\nAction.\n\n          After her termination, Barbour also applied for unemployment benefits with the TWC.\n\nIn January 2007, a telephone hearing was conducted. Montalvo and Human Resources\n\nrepresentative Candace Woodard participated in the telephone hearing on behalf of WPI.\n\nMontalvo stated that Barbour was terminated because of errors on a contact socket order and a\n\nknob order and her scheduling of time on the knob order. This was the first time Barbour had\n\nheard a reason for her termination. According to Barbour, she was never made aware of any\n\nerrors with the contact sockets order prior to her termination, or at any time prior to the TWC\n\nhearing. Barbour also testified that she did not make the errors on either the contact socket order\n\nor the chalk knobs work order.\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f       Valerie Dorsette was Barbour’s co-worker in the CaTS assembly area. Barbour testified\n\nthat Dorsette was the assembler on the knob work order and Barbour was only a helper. The\n\n“assembler” on the work order is responsible for confirming that the correct parts have been\n\nprovided and for completing the work order. According to Barbour, she had asked Dorsette\n\nwhether she confirmed that the knob order was correct, and Dorsette stated that she had.\n\n       On April 23, 2007, Barbour filed the instant suit alleging age discrimination. The case\n\nwas tried to a jury. The charge instructed the jury to answer three questions. Question 1 asked:\n\n       Was age a motivating factor in Williams-Pyro, Inc.’s decision to discharge\n       Rhonda Barbour?\n\n       A ‘motivating factor’ in an employment decision is a reason for making the\n       decision at the time it was made. There may be more than one motivating factor\n       for an employment decision.\n\n       Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’\n\nThe jury answered “yes.” Because the jury answered yes to Question 1, the jury was then\n\ninstructed to answer Question 2:\n\n       Would Williams-Pyro, Inc. have taken the same action inquired about in Question\n       1 when it did, in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor, if any?\n\n       Answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’\n\nThe jury answered “No.” Finally, the jury was asked to award damages based on their liability\n\ndetermination. In response to Question 3, the jury awarded Barbour $40,000 in damages for\n\nback pay, $10,000 in lost employment benefits, $100,000 in past compensatory damages, and\n\n$100,000 in future compensatory damages. After the jury rendered its verdict, WPI filed a post-\n\ntrial plea to the jurisdiction and a motion to dismiss. Barbour also filed a post-trial motion for\n\nattorney’s fees. On July 19, 2011, the trial court held a hearing. The next day, it signed an order\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\fdenying WPI’s plea to the jurisdiction. That same day it also signed its final judgment. The\n\njudgment stated in relevant part:\n\n       [A] jury, having been empaneled and sworn to try this cause, and after hearing the\n       pleadings, evidence, and argument of counsel, and after the trial court read the\n       Charge of the Court to the jury, the jury did return into open court its verdict, duly\n       signed by ten jurors, and in response to special issues, definitions and explanatory\n       instructions submitted to them by the Court in its Charge, which findings as\n       verdict of the jury were received by the Court and entered into the record and\n       minutes of the docket of said Court, and the Court heard arguments and evidence\n       regarding attorneys fees. The Court does hereby enter its Judgment as follows:\n\n       1. Plaintiff Barbour is hereby entitled to recover damages from the Defendant\n       Williams-Pyro, Inc., in the sum of One Hundred and Twenty Thousand and Seven\n       Hundred Fourteen Dollars and Forty Cents ($120,714.40), which includes. pre-\n       judgment interest that accrued on the award of past compensatory damages of\n       Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), and past lost wages awarded by the Court in\n       the amount of Forty Thousand Dollars, ($40,000.00) and past employment\n       benefits in the amount of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) at the rate of Five\n       percent (5%) per annum, simple interest. Such interest accrued from April 23,\n       2007, the date on which suit was filed in this cause through June 13, 2011.\n\n       2. The Court finds that counsel for the Plaintiff, Jason C.N. Smith and Zoe\n       Courtney, have reputations for providing highly competent, ethical, and qualified\n       legal representation of individuals in employment matters such as this case and\n       that Plaintiff is entitled to recover her reasonable and necessary attorney fees.\n       The Court awards reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and orders Defendant\n       to pay Plaintiff the amount of One Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Three Hundred\n       Thirty-Five Dollars ($154,335.00) in attorneys fees through trial, Thirty Thousand\n       Dollars ($30,000.00) for any appeal to the Court of Appeals in which she prevails,\n       Twelve Thousand Dollars ($12,000.00) for any Petition filed with the Texas\n       Supreme Court in which she prevails and Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) if\n       the Texas Supreme Court requests full briefing in which she prevails.\n\n       On August 29, 2011, the trial court filed two separate sets of findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law. One related to its decision denying WPI’s plea to the jurisdiction and motion\n\nto dismiss and the other related to Barbour’s motion for attorney’s fees. WPI then filed a Motion\n\nfor Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and Alternative Motion for New Trial. On September\n\n26, 2011, the trial court held a hearing to address both motions and on October 19, 2011, the trial\n\ncourt issued an order denying them in their entirety.\n\n                                               -9-\n\f                                        WPI’s APPEAL\n\n       WPI challenges both the factual and legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the\n\njury’s finding that Barbour’s age was a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate her\n\nemployment. It also contends that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case\n\nbecause Barbour failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing suit in district court.\n\nWe will begin by addressing WPI’s jurisdictional argument.\n\n                                   Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       In Issue Three, WPI argues that Barbour failed to properly exhaust her administrative\n\nremedies before filing the instant suit, thereby depriving the trial court and by extension this\n\ncourt of subject matter jurisdiction. Under Texas law, the exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nis a mandatory prerequisite to filing an action under TCHRA, and the failure to exhaust\n\nTCHRA’s administrative remedies deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.

On her sworn charge of discrimination,\n\nBarbour marked the box for “age” as the type of discrimination alleged.           EEOC Form 5\n\nrequested the following information: (1) personal harm; (2) reason for adverse action; and (3)\n\ndiscrimination statement. Barbour completed the “personal harm” section with the following\n\nstatement: “I was terminated from my job on 11/15/06.” She also stated on the form that she\n\nwas told by WPI that they did not need a reason to terminate her. Finally, as her “discrimination\n\nstatement,” Barbour stated that she “believed [she] was terminated because of her age, 44 years\n\nold, in violation of Texas Labor Code, Chapter 21.”\n\n\n\n                                              - 11 -\n\f       After denying WPI’s plea to the jurisdiction, the trial court issued findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law which stated in relevant part:\n\n       21. On February 26, 2007, Rhonda Barbour provided additional information to\n       the Texas Workforce Commission regarding her years of service at Williams-\n       Pyro, Inc. and her excellent work record.\n\n       22. Plaintiff did not allege a hostile work environment claim based on age in her\n       sworn charge of discrimination.\n\n       23. Rhonda Barbour received a Notice of Right to File a Civil Action on\n       February 27,2007.\n\n       On appeal, we must determine whether the allegations in Barbour’s original charge\n\nand/or her subsequent amendment could reasonably give rise to an investigation of her claims of\n\ndiscrimination based on age. See Pacheco, 448 F.3d at 789; Poindexter, 306 S.W.3d at 810;\n\nClayton Williams Energy, 2 S.W.3d at 738. As Barbour’s attorney’s pointed out during the plea\n\nto the jurisdiction hearing, a plaintiff does not have to put down every piece of information that\n\nshe will eventually use at trial on the EEOC form to sufficiently exhaust administrative remedies\n\nunder the statute. Here, Barbour’s EEOC claim alleged sufficient information to put WPI on\n\nnotice of her age discrimination claim. We conclude that Barbour exhausted her administrative\n\nremedies and overrule Issue Three.\n\n                                   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       In Issue One, WPI complains that the evidence is legally insufficient to prove that age\n\nwas a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate Barbour because there is no evidence\n\nthat: (1) WPI treated Barbour less favorably than similarly situated WPI employees of the\n\nopposing class; and (2) WPI’s proffered reasons for terminating Barbour were pretext for\n\ndiscrimination. Appellant also contends that, “Montalvo’s alleged workplace remarks are not\n\nevidence of pretext or that WPI terminated Barbour because of her age.” Alternatively, in Issue\n\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\fTwo, WPI argues that evidence is factually insufficient to support the finding that Barbour’s age\n\nwas a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate Barbour’s employment.\n\n       In conducting a legal sufficiency review, we view all evidence in a light most favorable\n\nto the prevailing party, indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the judgment.

Mission Consol., 372 S.W.3d at 634. “Direct\n\nevidence is evidence that, if believed, proves the fact of discriminatory animus without inference\n\n5\n    In its entirety, Section 21.051, titled, “Discrimination by Employer” states:\n\n           An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability,\n           religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n           (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other\n           manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or\n           privileges of employment; or\n\n           (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment in a manner that\n           would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect\n           in any other manner the status of an employee.\n\nTEX.LAB.CODE ANN. § 21.051.\n\n\n                                                          - 14 -\n\for presumption.” Sandstad v.

The Texas Supreme\n\nCourt agreed with the employer that the evidence supporting the finding that age was a\n\nmotivating factor in Reyes’s discharge was legally insufficient and reversed the Court of\n\nAppeals. AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 591. WPI focuses on the Supreme Court’s holding in\n\nAutoZone that the evidence failed to establish that the employer subjected the plaintiff to\n\ndisparate discipline and “discriminated against [him] by treating him less favorably than\n\nsimilarly-situated younger employees” who violated the company’s sexual harassment policy.\n\nAutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 593-95. However, this was just a small portion of the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision. WPI ignores the fact that under the very standard used in AutoZone, Barbour presented\n\nsufficient direct evidence of discriminatory animus.\n\n       The court’s analysis in AutoZone began by discussing whether remarks made by a store\n\nmanager constituted evidence of discrimination. Id. at 593-94. The employer argued that\n\nstatements made to a parts service manager by a store manager that the employer intended to get\n\nrid of “the old people” were “stray remarks” made by an individual who was not part of and had\n\nno input into the decision to fire Reyes.       Id. at 592.   The Supreme Court specifically\n\nacknowledged that “remarks and statements may serve as evidence of discrimination,” if they\n\nare: (1) related to the employee’s protected class, (2) close in time to the employment decision,\n\n(3) made by an individual with authority over the employment decision, and (4) related to the\n\n\n\n                                              - 17 -\n\femployment decision at issue. [Emphasis added]. Id. at 593. The court concluded that the\n\nevidence showed the store manager played no part in, had no leverage over, and exerted no\n\ninfluence concerning the employer’s investigation or decision to fire the plaintiff.7 Id. The\n\nSupreme Court also determined that no person involved in the investigation or subsequent\n\ntermination decision ever spoke to or took a statement from the store manager, that the store\n\nmanager “did not work in the store where the sexual harassment allegedly occurred,” that the\n\nstore manager had no authority over the plaintiff until the plaintiff was transferred to the\n\nmanager’s store while the harassment allegation was being investigated, and that the store\n\nmanager testified at the trial that he had no involvement in the investigation or termination\n\ndecision. Id. With respect to the store manager’s “get rid of ‘the old people’” statements, the\n\nSupreme Court found no evidence that the manager represented the employer’s motive or intent.8\n\nId. at 592.\n\n        The instant case is distinguishable. There was testimony that Montalvo made comments\n\nto Barbour that she was getting “old,” about her having “gray hair,” and about her “sagging\n\nbreasts,” and such comments were clearly related to Barbour’s age, and because Barbour was\n\nover forty, they were related to her “protected class.” Barbour also testified that Montalvo made\n\nthese comments “nonstop,” “three or four times a week” and “all the time,” up until her\n\ntermination. Since Barbour’s alleged adverse employment action was her termination, these\n\ncomments were certainly made in “proximate time to the adverse employment decision.” In\n\naddition, Barbour testified that Montalvo made comments that the company “need[ed] to hire\n\n\n7\n  The termination decision was made by a regional manager on the basis of a recommendation made by a company\nemployee relations specialist who had reviewed written statements obtained from the plaintiff, the coworker that\nwas allegedly harassed by the plaintiff, and other employees. AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 591.\n8\n  The court also noted that at trial the store manager (who no longer worked for the employer) testified that he was\nonly communicating his personal opinion that the employer was attempting to remove long-time managers who\nwere not following the employer’s policies. AutoZone, 272 S.W.3d at 592-93.\n\n                                                      - 18 -\n\fyoung Mexican girls.” Montalvo’s comments regarding Barbour’s age and the need for “young\n\nMexican girls” is “related to the employment decision at issue.” Therefore, the only remaining\n\nquestion is whether Montalvo was an individual with authority over the employment decision at\n\nissue - i.e. Barbour’s termination.

Even if the person who made the comments is not the\n\ndecision maker, if the evidence shows that person possessed leverage or exerted influence over\n\nthe decision-maker, then the discriminatory animus may be imputed to an employer. AutoZone,\n\n272 S.W.3d at 593, citing Russell, 235 F.3d at 226-27.\n\n       It is undisputed that Montalvo was WPI’s production manager and that as such, he was\n\nresponsible for personnel issues. Montalvo, Paul Shiller, and Candace Woodard were the only\n\npeople present when Barbour was terminated. Montalvo was the only one who spoke and the\n\none who actually informed Barbour she was fired.\n\n       There is also sufficient evidence showing that even if Montalvo was not directly\n\nresponsible for the decision to terminate Barbour, he influenced the decision. WPI points to\n\ntestimony that Della Williams was the one who made the decision to terminate Barbour, and that\n\nsince Mrs. Williams was unaware of any comments made by Montalvo, there is no evidence of\n\n\n\n                                             - 19 -\n\fdiscriminatory intent. But Montalvo himself testified that Mrs. Williams was not involved in the\n\ndecision to terminate Barbour. The jury was free to disbelieve the testimony that Mrs. Williams\n\nalone made the termination decision.\n\n        Therefore, while a lack of evidence regarding the treatment of similarly situated\n\nemployees could prevent Barbour from enjoying the benefit of the prima facie presumption, it\n\ndoes not preclude the possibility that Barbour presented sufficient direct evidence to show that\n\nage was a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate her. We find that Barbour presented\n\nsuch direct evidence of discriminatory intent via Montalvo’s comments.9\n\n        Here, WPI asserted it Barbour was terminated for multiple reasons. First, WPI points to\n\nevidence that it fired Barbour based on two complaints from Barbour’s “Line Lead,” Tammy\n\nRenteria, that Barbour failed to follow written work orders. In addition, WPI points to the\n\ntestimony of Della Williams wherein Ms. Williams stated that Barbour (1) had “missed a lot of\n\nwork”; and (2) “had had a lot of conflict with a lot of different employees in the organization.”\n\nHowever, all of the testimony supporting these contentions was directly contested by Barbour.\n\nAs the judges of witness credibility and demeanor, the jury was free to believe or disbelieve the\n\ntestimony.\n\n        We conclude that the evidence presented would allow a reasonable and fair-minded jury\n\nto find that Barbour’s age was a motivating factor in WPI’s decision to terminate her. Likewise,\n\nthe jury’s finding cannot be said to be so against the great weight of the evidence as to be clearly\n\nwrong or unjust. Issues One and Two are overruled.\n\n\n\n9\n   We acknowledge that the fact Barbour presented direct evidence of discriminatory intent did not automatically\nrequire a verdict in her favor. “[T]he existence of direct evidence only shifted the burdens of production and\npersuasion to [WPI] to show that it would have made the same employment decision regardless of [Barbour’s] age.”\nSee Brown, 96 S.W.3d at 599 n.5, citing Price Waterhouse v.

In a single issue, Barbour argues that the trial\n\ncourt erred by concluding that it lacked authority to enhance the amount of attorney’s fees\n\nawarded to Barbour.\n\n       The parties agreed (pretrial) that, whatever the outcome, the trial court would determine\n\nthe attorney’s fee award. After the jury returned its verdict in favor of Barbour, Barbour filed a\n\nMotion for Attorney’s Fees.      In her motion, Barbour requested that the trial court award\n\nattorneys’ fees through trial and post-verdict proceedings, as well as appellate attorney fees.\n\nBarbour also requested an enhancement of the base fee for both trial fees and any appellate fees.\n\nSpecifically, Barbour requested that the trial court apply a multiplier of two (2) in determining\n\nreasonable attorneys’ fees. WPI filed a response and objections to Barbour’s motion.\n\n       On July 19, 2011, the trial court held a hearing on attorney’s fees. The following day, the\n\ntrial court issued its judgment awarding Barbour “reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees” in\n\nthe amount of $154,335. WPI requested findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial\n\ncourt’s findings of fact included findings that: (1) Barbour’s attorneys spent a total of 545 hours\n\nand 45 minutes on Barbour’s case (through the jury trial and post-verdict hearings and briefings);\n\nand (2) 514 hours and 45 minutes was a reasonable and necessary amount of hours. The trial\n\ncourt also found the reasonable hourly rates for Barbour’s attorneys were: (1) $300 per hour for\n\nJason Smith; (2) $300 an hour for Zoe Courtney; and (3) $200 an hour for John Brender. The\n\ntrial court then stated a number of findings detailing the qualifications of the attorneys.\n\nFollowing such statements, the court, in finding of fact number 32, stated:\n\n       The Court finds that Rhonda Barbour’s reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees\n       through the trial of this case and for post verdict hearings and briefing\n       are One Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-Five Dollars\n\n\n\n                                              - 21 -\n\f         ($154,335.00).10\n\nIn its conclusions of law, the trial court specifically stated that Barbour should recover attorneys’\n\nfees in the amount of $154,335. On appeal, Barbour challenges only the trial court’s final\n\nconclusion of law stating:\n\n         The Court concludes that it is not authorized to utilize a multiplier in awarding\n         attorneys’ fees under Chapter 21.259, but finds that a 1.5 multiplier would be\n         appropriate if an appellate court concludes otherwise.\n\nBarbour argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law by concluding that it did not have the\n\nauthority under Texas Labor Code Section 21.259 to apply a multiplier to enhance the amount of\n\nattorney’s fees in an age discrimination case.

El Apple I, Ltd, 370 S.W.3d at 759. In step one, the court determines the\n\nreasonable number of hours spent by counsel on the case and a reasonable hourly rate for the\n\nwork performed. Id. The court then multiplies the number of hours reasonably expended by the\n\nreasonable hourly rate to arrive at the lodestar. Id.

However, it\n\nrecognized that “exceptional circumstances may justify enhancements to the base lodestar” Id.\n\nIn other words, once the base lodestar has been calculated, a court may raise or lower the\n\nlodestar amount if certain relevant factors indicate an adjustment is necessary.\n\n        The relevant factors the court may consider in determining whether an adjustment is\n\n\n11\n    The remedies provided under TCHRA mirror those available under those available in federal employment\ndiscrimination law.

Instead, she contends that\n\nthe trial court erred as a matter of law by concluding that it was not authorized to utilize a\n\nmultiplier in awarding attorney’s fees under Section 21.259.          Barbour relies on the Texas\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in El Apple I and argues that it confirms that the trial court below\n\nerred in concluding that it was not authorized to utilize a multiplier.\n\n       While El Apple acknowledges that a multiplier may be applied to the lodestar amount in\n\ncases filed under the Texas Labor Code, it specified that only “exceptional circumstances may\n\njustify enhancements to the base lodestar.” El Apple I, Ltd., 370 S.W.3d at 760.

The\n\nproblem here is that the findings of fact indicate that the trial court relied on each one of these\n\nfactors in determining the lodestar. Barbour does not point to any additional evidence indicating\n\nexceptional circumstances existed which would warrant utilization of a multiplier. Likewise, we\n\ndo not find any indication that Barbour’s counsel ever identified which factors supported the use\n\nof a multiplier, separate and distinct from those use to calculate the base lodestar.\n\n       The trial court specifically and repeatedly referred to the fees awarded as “reasonable and\n\nnecessary.” Under Texas law, that is all the trial court is authorized to award. Finding no error,\n\nwe overrule Barbour’s sole point and affirm the judgment.\n\n\nMarch 20, 2013\n                                       ANN CRAWFORD McCLURE, Chief Justice\n\nBefore McClure, C.J., Rivera, and Antcliff, JJ.\nAntcliff, J., not participating\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 26 -\n\f</pre>",
