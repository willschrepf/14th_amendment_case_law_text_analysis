FILED: May 28, 2013\n\n\n      Appelwick, J. — Zellmer was convicted of murdering his three year old\n\nstepdaughter. He argues that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of prior bad\n\nacts, violated his right to a public trial, allowed improper expert testimony, gave cag\n\nerroneous unanimity instruction, violated his right to be present for a jury inquSk, a7l£\nimproperly unsealed documents.        He also argues the State violated his rigfft toga?\n\nconfidential relationship with his attorney prior to trial and committed prosecutorial;\n\nmisconduct at trial. We affirm.                                                     ^    \"-'\\'~:\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n\n      Stacey Ferguson and Joel Zellmer met and began dating in May 2003. Two\n\nweeks later, Zellmer proposed in front of his friends and Stacey said yes to avoid\n\nembarrassing him.     Although she had reservations about getting married, Stacey\n\ndecided to go through with the wedding after she became pregnant in July. They were\n\nmarried in September 2003, and Stacey and her three year old daughter, Ashley\n\nMcLellan, moved into Zellmer's home. .\n\n      Stacey worked full-time as an office manager at a chiropractic clinic. Zellmer did\n\nnot work. He initially told Stacey that he was a semi-retired police officer and firefighter\n\nthat now did day trading.    Later, Stacey learned that Zellmer was actually collecting\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/2\n\n\n\n\nbenefits from the Washington Department of Labor and Industries (L&l).           Zellmer\n\nshowed Stacey a medical book and explained the different things he needed to prove to\n\nget a full L&l pension. He told her that he had a doctor in his back pocket who would\n\nwrite anything Zellmer wanted him to write. Stacey did not think Zellmer had actual\n\nimpairments and believed he was capable of working.\n\n      Soon after the wedding, Zellmer suggested they obtain life insurance policies on\n\nStacey and Ashley. Stacey went along with it. They obtained a $200,000 policy on\n\nAshley's life. They also took out policiesfor Zellmer's sons, Dakota and Levi.\n\n      Their relationship was tumultuous, and Stacey and Ashley moved back and forth\n\nbetween Stacey's parents' home and Zellmer's home. Ashley became increasingly\n\nuncomfortable around Zellmer.      One time, Stacey noticed scrapes on Ashley, and\n\nAshley reported that Zellmer had pushed her. During arguments with Stacey, Zellmer\nthreatened that he knew how to use the legal system to obtain custody of their unborn\n\nchild. When Stacey threatened to report Zellmer's L&l fraud, Zellmer told her, \"you\n\nnever mess with a man's money.\"\n\n       On December 3, 2003, Stacey went to work and left Ashley at home in Zellmer's\n\ncare because Ashley had a high temperature and could not go to daycare.             That\n\nevening, Dakota called 911 and reported a drowning involving a three year old victim.\n\nEmergency responders arrived at Zellmer's residence and found Zellmer kneeling over\n\nAshley's body. Zellmer claimed he discovered Ashley floating at the deep end of the\n\npool, lifted her out, and carried her to the living room. He indicated that Ashley must\n\nhave gone outside to eat a cake that was left on the back porch, gone down to the pool\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/3\n\n\n\nto wash her hands so she would not get in trouble, and had accidentally fallen in. A\n\ncake box was on the back porch, directly outside the back door.            The pool is\n\napproximately 20 yards from the back door, down two flights of stairs, and at the end of\n\na concrete path. On that night, the deck was slippery, the temperature was in the 30s,\n\nand it was so dark that police officers needed a flashlight to see. Medical personnel\n\nwere unable to get any self-sustaining response from Ashley. She died in the hospital\n\non December 5, 2003.\n\n      The State charged Zellmer with murder in the first degree, murder in the second\n\ndegree, and theft in the first degree in June 2007. By amended information, the State\n\nadded two more counts of first-degree theft.1 The theft charges were severed from the\n\nmurder charges.\n\n      At trial, the State presented evidence of three incidents in which other young\n\nchildren were injured or suffered accidents while in Zellmer's care.         The State\n\nintroduced this evidence to argue that Zellmer had an overarching plan to marry single\n\nmothers, take out life insurance on their young children, then injure those children in\n\nseemingly accidental ways to collect insurance proceeds.\n\n      The first incident involved four month old Mitchell Komendant.       Shortly after\n\nZellmer and Stacey Komendant were married in 1990, Zellmer added uninsured\n\nmotorist coverage to their car insurance policy. Not long after, Zellmer encouraged\n\nKomendant to take Mitchell to the emergency room, because he seemed unusually\n\n\n       1 The theft charges alleged that Zellmer obtained control over (1) property\nbelonging to the State of Washington, (2) mortgage loan funds belonging to Ownit\nMortgage Company, and (3) insurance damage claim payments belonging to Allstate\nInsurance Company.\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/4\n\n\n\n\nfussy. Zellmer told emergency room staff that his car was rear-ended in a hit and run\n\nthe day before, and Mitchell had moved a little sideways in his car seat. The doctor\n\ntook x-rays, but found nothing.      The next day, Zellmer filed an accident report.\n\nKomendant saw Zellmer deliberately scratch the back of her car to make it seem like it\n\nhad been rear-ended.    He admitted to Komendant that there was no accident, but he\n\nwanted to make sure Mitchell's medical bills were covered, even though the doctor had\n\nfound nothing wrong at that point.\n\n      When Mitchell did not get better, Zellmer and Komendant took him back to the\n\ndoctor, who found fractures in both of Mitchell's legs. Zellmer gave a new story that a\n\nbriefcase fell from the back window onto Mitchell's legs during the purported accident.\n\nZellmer then attempted to recover the full $25,000 allowable under their insurance, even\n\nthough Mitchell's hospital bills did not amount to that much.\n\n       The second incident involved Kyle Clauson, who was less than a year old and\n\nstill in the crawling stage of his development at the time. In 2000, about a month into\n\nZellmer's relationship with Kelley Clauson, Zellmer was watching Kyle in his bedroom\n\nwhile Clauson fixed dinner.   Dakota called out to Clauson that Zellmer needed to see\n\nher right away. She found Kyle on the floor of Zellmer's bedroom dripping wet with a\n\nbluish pallor, and Zellmer standing over him, watching. For several minutes, Zellmer\n\nwould not let Clauson pick Kyle up. She finally did and slapped Kyle on the back to\n\nmake him cough up water. Zellmer told Clauson that Kyle had somehow crawled out of\n\nthe room and gotten into the hot tub outside and Zellmer rescued him. There was a\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/5\n\n\n\n\nthick, heavy cover on the hot tub. Clauson thought it unlikely that Kyle would have been\n\nable to crawl up the hot tub stairs and push the cover off.\n\n       The final incident involved four year old Madison Barnett. Zellmer and Madison's\n\nmother, Michelle Barnett, knew each other only a short time before Zellmer proposed.\n\nShortly after they were engaged, Zellmer suggested getting life insurance.         Barnett\n\nlaughed and responded, \"What are you going to do, bump me off?\" Zellmer got very\n\ndefensive and did not bring up the subject again. In December 2002, a year before\n\nAshley's drowning, Zellmer offered to take care of Madison while her mother was busy.\n\nWhen Barnett came home, she found Madison withdrawn, her head down, and in a\n\ndifferent set of clothes. Zellmer prodded Madison to tell her mother what happened.\n\nMadison explained that she fell into Zellmer's pool and that Zellmer rescued Madison,\n\npulling her out of the pool by her hair. Barnett's and Zellmer's relationship ended shortly\n\nthereafter.\n\n       The State also presented evidence that Zellmer changed his story about what\n\nhappened the night of Ashley's drowning several times. Zellmer initially reported that he\n\nput on a video tape downstairs for Ashley to watch then went upstairs to take a nap.\n\nAfter Dakota woke him up, he went looking for Ashley, found a cake box on the back\n\ndeck that had been opened, and discovered Ashley in the pool. But, in 2004, he told\n\nfour different acquaintances four different stories about what he was doing when Ashley\n\ndrowned.\n\n\n       In the spring, he told a childhood acquaintance that he was at home with Ashley\n\nand his son Levi, waiting for Dakota to get home. He fell asleep, and when he woke up\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/6\n\n\n\n\nhe couldn't find Ashley in the house. He eventually discovered that she had fallen into\n\nthe pool.\n\n       In the summer, Zellmer dated Levi's former history teacher. Zellmer told her that\n\non the night of Ashley's death, he instructed Ashley to go to her room to watch a video.\n\nMeanwhile, he went downstairs to build a fire. While he was building the fire, Dakota\n\ninformed him that the door to the backyard was open. He went into the backyard and\n\ndiscovered Ashley in the pool. Zellmer repeated that approximate version of events in\n\nsworn declarations he signed in August 2004 and January 2005.\n\n       Zellmer also renewed a friendship with a high school friend after they discovered\n\ntheir children played baseball together. When the topic of Ashley's death came up,\n\nZellmer said that he was downstairs doing laundry. He went upstairs to find her and\n\ndiscovered that she was in the pool.\n\n       At some point in 2004, Zellmer began dating a young bank teller, who had a one\n\nand a half year old child. During the course of their short-lived relationship, Zellmer\n\nsuggested that they get married and that she get life insurance for her child. Regarding\n\nAshley's death, Zellmer told her that he had been outside chopping wood, and his two\n\nsons were inside watching Ashley. He said that Ashley went into the backyard and fell\n\ninto the pool.\n\n       Each of Zellmer's versions of events, in which Ashley went to the pool on her\n\nown, conflicted with extensive testimony about Ashley's disposition. Ashley was afraid\n\nof the dark and refused to voluntarily enter dark rooms. She disliked the cold. She\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/7\n\n\n\n\ncould not swim, disliked bodies of water, and did not have any interest in going to the\n\npool. She clung to caregivers and never wandered off on her own.\n\n       The jury found Zellmer guilty of second degree murder, with an aggravating\n\nfactor due to Ashley's particular vulnerability. It did not reach a verdict as to first degree\n\nmurder.\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n       On appeal, Zellmer argues that reversal is warranted by a number of trial court\n\nerrors and improper acts by the State, both before and during trial.           First, Zellmer\n\nargues that during the course of investigation and prosecution, the State knowingly\n\nviolated his constitutional right to a confidential relationship with his attorney. Second,\n\nhe claims that the trial court erred in admitting three prior incidents in which children\n\nwere harmed while in Zellmer's care as evidence of a common plan or scheme under\n\nER 404(b). Third, Zellmer contends that the trial court violated his right to a public trial\n\nby excluding the teenage son of a witness from the courtroom during trial. Fourth,\n\nZellmer argues that the trial court erred in allowing an expert tracker to opine that\n\nAshley did not walk across the back deck based on his analysis of crime scene\n\nphotographs. He also argues that a second tracker's testimony about the opinion of a\n\nthird nontestifying tracker violated his right to confront witnesses against him. Fifth,\n\nZellmer argues the State committed prosecutorial misconduct by appealing to the jury's\n\nsympathy for Ashley's family during closing argument. Sixth, he claims that the trial\n\ncourt gave an erroneous unanimity instruction to the jury. Seventh, Zellmer asserts that\n\nthe court violated his constitutional right to be present by answering a question from the\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/8\n\n\n\ndeliberating jury in Zellmer's absence.     Eighth, he contends that cumulative error\n\nwarrants reversal of his conviction. And lastly, he argues that the trial court improperly\n\nunsealed documents involving his requests for expert funding and claims that his\n\nattorney-client privilege was violated.\n\n  I.   Right to Counsel\n\n       Zellmer argues that during the course of investigation and prosecution, the State\n\nknowingly and sometimes deliberately violated his constitutional right to a confidential\n\nrelationship with his counsel. Zellmer contends that the State intruded into his attorney-\n\nclient relationship in two ways.      First, he argues that the State used a jailhouse\n\ninformant, Kevin Olsen, to gather information about Zellmer regarding his trial\n\npreparation and strategy. Second, he argues that the State used search warrants and\n\nsubpoena authority to seize documents that contained privileged attorney-client\n\ncommunications. Zellmer contends that the State gained intangible benefits from these\n\nalleged violations. As such, he argues, prejudice must be presumed and the only\n\neffective remedy is dismissal.2\n       Zellmer moved to dismiss his charges because the State seized privileged\n\ndocuments from his home. A trial court's denial of a motion to dismiss is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion. State v. Hanna. 123 Wn.2d 704, 715, 871 P.2d 135 (1994); State\n\nv. Granacki. 90 Wn. App. 598, 602 n.3, 959 P.2d 667 (1998). A trial court abuses its\n\n\n\n       2Zellmer was also permitted to make a supplemental assignment of error that the\ntrial court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing or reviewing sealed documents to\ndetermine the extent of the violation of his attorney-client privilege. But, Zellmer makes\nno other argument and cites no authority for this supplemental assignment of error, so\nwe need not consider it. RAP 10.3(a)(6).\n\n\n                                                8\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/9\n\n\n\n\ndiscretion when its decision is manifestly unreasonable or exercised on untenable\n\ngrounds or for untenable reasons.       State v. Lord, 161 Wn.2d 276, 283-84, 165 P.3d\n\n1251 (2007).\n\n       Zellmer also filed a motion to exclude Olsen's testimony, but did not move to\n\ndismiss based upon Olsen's involvement or testimony. As a result, the trial court did not\n\nhave an opportunity to consider whether dismissal was the appropriate remedy on the\n\njailhouse informant issue. See Salas v. Hi-Tech Erectors, 168 Wn.2d 664, 671 n.2, 230\n\nP.3d 583 (2010).         Therefore, Zellmer has waived the issue absent manifest\n\nconstitutional error. RAP 2.5(a)(3). An error raised for the first time on appeal must be\n\nmanifest and truly of constitutional dimension. State v. Kirkman, 159 Wn.2d 918, 926,\n\n155 P.3d 125 (2007). The defendant must show how the alleged error actually affected\n\nhis rights at trial. ]g\\ at 926-27.\n\n       A defendant's right to effective counsel is protected by the Sixth Amendment of\n\nthe federal constitution and article I, section 22 of the state constitution. Intrusion into\n\nprivate attorney-client communications violates a defendant's right to effective\n\nrepresentation and due process. State v. Cory. 62 Wn.2d 371, 374-75, 382 P.2d 1019\n\n(1963).\n\n   A. Deliberate, Egregious Intrusion\n\n       Two themes arise in Washington cases addressing this issue. First, dismissal is\n\nwarranted      when    the    State's   intrusion   into   the   defendant's   attorney-client\n\ncommunications is both deliberate and egregious.            Second, the State's intrusion is\n\ndeliberate and egregious when the intercepted communications are those between the\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/10\n\n\n\n\ndefendant and his counsel in the case being tried. For instance, in Cory, the defendant\n\nmet with his attorney to discuss his case in a private jail room, where a sheriffs deputy\n\nhad secretly installed a microphone to eavesdrop on their conversations. Id. at 372.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court concluded that dismissal was the only appropriate\n\nremedy, because it was impossible to isolate the resulting prejudice. JcL at 377-78. The\n\nofficer's \"shocking and unpardonable\" conduct deprived Cory of his right to effective\n\ncounsel, vitiating the entire proceeding. ]p\\ at 378.\n\n       In Granacki, during trial recess, a detective read defense counsel's trial notes\n\nand engaged in a discussion with a sitting juror. 90 Wn. App. at 600. The trial court\n\ndeclared a mistrial. Id. at 601. After briefing, the trial court concluded the detective had\n\nintentionally read counsel's notes and that dismissal based on that conduct was\n\nwarranted,   id.   This court acknowledged that the intrusion into Granacki's right to\n\ncounsel was less egregious than the eavesdropping in Cory, but was nonetheless\n\nanalogous, so it was within the trial court's discretion to dismiss. Id at 603-04. Both the\n\nCory and Granacki courts found dismissal appropriate to discourage such deliberate\n\nand egregious intrusions into the defendant's attorney-client privilege. ]g\\\n\n       In Garza, prison guards seized inmates' personal property, including legal\n\ndocuments containing private communications with their attorneys. State v. Garza, 99\n\nWn. App. 291, 293, 994 P.2d 868 (2000). When the materials were returned to the\n\ninmates, it was clear they had been examined and possibly even read. Jd. at 296. The\n\nappellate court concluded that the State intruded upon the defendants' private\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/11\n\n\n\n\nrelationships with their attorneys. Jd The court remanded for additional fact-finding to\n\ndetermine if the jail's security concerns justified the purposeful intrusion, id. at 301.\n\n       •n Perrow. detectives seized documents pursuant to a search warrant that\n\nincluded notes the defendant wrote in preparation for meeting with his attorney about\n\nthe allegations against him. State v. Perrow, 156 Wn. App. 322, 326, 231 P.3d 853\n\n(2010).   The defendant informed the detectives that they had seized privileged\n\nmaterials. Jd Nevertheless, one detective then read through the privileged documents\n\npage by page and prepared a written analysis of them and forwarded it to the\n\nprosecutor's office. Jd. The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in dismissing the defendant's charges, because it was impossible to isolate\n\nany resulting prejudice.3 Jdat332.\n   B. Appropriate Remedy\n\n       When the State intrudes into the defendant's attorney-client relationship, the\n\nquestion remains what is the appropriate remedy.           Zellmer argues that the State's\n\nintrusion is a structural error, requiring a presumption of prejudice and automatic\n\ndismissal. This contention is not supported by controlling case law. Since Cory, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court rejected a per se rule that any government intrusion into\n\nprivate attorney-client communications establishes a Sixth Amendment violation of the\n\n\n       3 Zellmer also relies extensively on the Connecticut case State v. Lenarz, 301\nConn. 417, 22 A.3d 536 (2011). There, the facts were very similar to Perrow. The\nState seized voluminous materials from the defendant's home.           Lenarz, 301 Conn, at\n420. After defense counsel informed the State that certain materials were privileged,\nthe court ordered that any such items remain unpublished and unread. Jd But, the\nstate laboratory analyzing the seized documents discovered detailed discussions of the\ndefendant's trial strategy, that it forwarded to the police, who in turn forwarded the\nmaterials to the prosecutor. Jd at 421.\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/12\n\n\n\n\ndefendant's right to counsel. Weatherford v. Bursev, 429 U.S. 545, 552, 97 S. Ct. 837,\n\n51 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1977).        Rather, constitutional validity depends on whether the\n\nimproperly obtained information has \"produced, directly or indirectly, any of the\n\nevidence offered at trial.\" Jd. In Weatherford. an undercover agent sat in on a meeting\n\nwith his co-conspirators and their attorneys to maintain his undercover identity. Jd at\n\n547-48.    The Court held that there was no violation of the conspirators' Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel, because the agent did not communicate any defense\n\nstrategy to the prosecution and there was no purposeful intrusion. Jd. at 558.\n\n      This is further supported in Washington cases.          In Granacki, we noted that\n\ngovernmental misconduct generally does not require dismissal absent actual prejudice\n\nto the defendant. 90 Wn. App. at 604. Even then, the trial court may properly choose to\n\nimpose a lesser sanction, because this is a classic example of trial court discretion. Jd\n\nIn that case, had the trial court chosen to ban the detective from the courtroom, exclude\n\nhis testimony, and prohibit him from discussing the case with anyone, we would not\n\nhave found an abuse of discretion. Jd.        Similarly, the Garza court recognized that\n\ndismissal is not required where prejudice is contained by suppressing the evidence or\n\nordering a new trial. 99 Wn. App. at 300. The Garza court held that if the trial court\n\nfound on remand that the jail officers' actions violated the defendants' right to counsel, it\n\nhad discretion to fashion the appropriate remedy. Jd. at 301-02. The court noted that\n\ndismissal is an extraordinary remedy, appropriate only when less severe sanctions will\n\nbe ineffective. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/13\n\n\n\n\n          Weatherford. Granacki, and Garza soundly rebut Zellmer's claim that such\n\nviolations are structural errors requiring automatic reversal. Indeed, structural errors are\n\nrare and Washington courts are exceedingly hesitant to classify errors as such. State v.\n\nPaumier, 176 Wn.2d 29, 46, 288 P.3d 1126 (2012); see also In re Pers. Restraint of\n\nBenn. 134 Wn.2d 868, 921, 252 P.2d 116 (1998) (rejecting argument that violation of\n\nthe right to be present is a structural error).      Examples of structural error include\n\ncomplete deprivation of counsel, a biased trial judge, racial discrimination in the\n\nselection of a grand jury, and denial of the right to self-representation. Paumier, 176\n\nWn.2d at 46; see, e.g.. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 146, 126 S. Ct.\n\n2557, 165 L. Ed. 2d 409 (2006).        Given this strong presumption against structural\n\nerrors, we decline to find one where no case law supports doing so.\n\n   C. Jailhouse Informant\n\n          Zellmer moved to exclude Olsen's testimony, arguing in part that the State used\n\nOlsen to deliberately elicit information about the charged crime, violating his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel under Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 205-06, 84\n\nS. Ct. 1199, 12 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1964). The trial court held an extensive pretrial hearing\n\non the motion and considered the following facts.        Olsen was a long-time jailhouse\n\nsnitch.     In November 2007, he contacted Detective Mike Ciesynski to volunteer\n\ninformation about four different cases, including Zellmer's. Both Ciesynski and Olsen\n\nthen contacted Detective Sue Peters, who was investigating Zellmer's case. But, there\n\nwas no evidence that Ciesynski encouraged Olsen to eavesdrop on Zellmer or offered\n\nany benefit to Olsen for the information on Zellmer. Peters acknowledged to Olsen that\n\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/14\n\n\n\n\nZellmer was a thorn in her side, but instructed Olsen not to solicit any other information\n\nfrom Zellmer. However, Peters met with Olsen in December 2008, and Olsen called her\n\na number of times afterward.       Detectives and prosecutors spoke with Olsen several\n\nmore times to take recorded statements about his conversations with Zellmer.         They\n\nalso did not separate Zellmer and Olsen, who were in the same tank together in jail.\n\n       The court found that the State did not deliberately solicit any disclosures from\n\nOlsen. As such, the court found that the detectives and prosecutors did not engage in\n\nany misconduct. But, the court explained that after Olsen's initial disclosure, the State\n\nrealized it \"had an ear into the defense\" and kept listening, when it should have stopped\n\nand separated Zellmer and Olsen. As a result, the court categorically excluded all\n\nevidence of subsequent disclosures Olsen made to the State after his initial contact with\n\nDetective Ciesynski. This remedy is similar to the one acknowledged in Granacki as\n\nlegitimately within the court's discretion.\n\n       Nevertheless, Zellmer contends that the State's '\"ear into the defense'\" was\n\nuseful in shaping its trial strategy. For instance, Olsen told detectives that Zellmer said\n\nhis anger got the best of him when he drowned Ashley. The State acknowledged that\n\nthis was the first and only time Zellmer admitted that Ashley did not get into the pool on\n\nher own.      But, the State argued at trial that Zellmer's murder of Ashley was\n\npremeditated based on his overarching plan to claim her life insurance proceeds—not\n\nthat his anger got the best of him. Other than baldly asserting that Olsen's information\n\nshaped trial strategy, Zellmer makes no showing that Olsen's disclosures led to\n\ndiscovery of other evidence or altered the State's trial strategy. Rather, the trial court\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/15\n\n\n\n\neffectively isolated any potential prejudice by excluding the evidence, without resorting\n\nto the drastic remedy of dismissal.\n\n       Moreover, in Cory, Granacki. Grath, and Perrow. a government agent intruded\n\ninto the defendant's attorney-client relationship.    Zellmer's case is distinguishable,\n\nbecause the trial court found that Olsen was not acting as a government agent. Zellmer\n\ndoes not challenge that finding. See State v. Hunter, 100 Wn. App. 198, 204, 997 P.2d\n\n393 (2000). No government official asked Olsen to serve as an informant in Zellmer's\n\ncase and there was no agreement that he would do so. In fact, detectives told Olsen\n\nnot to spy on or engage with Zellmer, because it was illegal. The trial court explained:\n\n       There's nothing in this record to indicate that Detective Ciesynski or\n       anybody else put Mr. Olsen with Mr. Zellmer, was looking for Mr. Olsen to\n       gather any information from Mr. Zellmer, provided any explicit, implicit\n       offer of benefit to Mr. Olsen for providing information about Mr. Zellmer, or\n       otherwise engaged in improper behavior with regard to Mr. Olsen and Mr.\n       Zellmer.\n\nThe trial court even chastised defense counsel for making such accusations without a\n\nshred of evidentiary support. Because Olsen was not a government agent, there can be\n\nno government misconduct as a matter of law.4 See Benn, 134 Wn.2d at 912; Hunter.\n100 Wn. App. at 205.      In Hunter, we found similar fact—that no government officer\n\ndirected informant toward defendant or asked him to gather information on the\n\n\n\n\n       4 Though Zellmer does not challenge Olsen's agency, it is worth nothing that\ncourts have declined to find agency when \"'there was no evidence that the government\nhad directed or steered the informant toward the defendant.'\" Benn, 134 Wn.2d at 912\n(quoting United States v. York. 933 F.2d 1343, 1356 (7th Cir. 1991)). Courts have\nlikewise declined to find agency \"even when the informant and the defendant were\nplaced in the same cell, because there was no prior agreement between the\ngovernment and the informant.\" Jd\n\n\n                                                15\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/16\n\n\n\n\ndefendant, and there was no agreement that he would do so—dispositive in affirming\n\nthe trial court's denial of the defendant's motion to dismiss. 100 Wn. App. at 202, 205.\n\n        The trial court acted within its discretion by excluding all evidence of Olsen's\n\nconversations with the State about Zellmer. Exclusion isolated any potential prejudice.\n\nWe find no constitutional violation and no basis to dismiss on these grounds.\n\n   D. Seized Documents and Insurance Files\n\n\n        In December 2005, the State obtained a search warrant for Zellmer's residence.\n\nPolice officers executed the warrant and obtained large volumes of documents from the\n\nhome.      At the time of the search, the officers knew Zellmer was involved in judicial\n\nproceedings. In addition to divorce and custody disputes, Stacey had sued Zellmer for\n\nwrongful death. Accordingly, the officers at the scene took precautions to scan and\n\nsegregate privileged documents.        They did not review any arguably privileged\n\ndocuments. After the seizure, Zellmer's attorney advised the prosecution that the State\n\nhad seized privileged materials.5 The State permitted Zellmer's attorney to look through\nseized items and identify those that were either privileged or beyond the scope of the\n\nwarrant.     The court then appointed a special master to review items that Zellmer's\n\n\n        5 In August 2006, Zellmer filed a motion for the return of property. He argued\nthat there was no probable cause to support the search warrant, that the warrant lacked\nsufficient particularity, and that the seizures exceeded the scope of the warrant. At that\ntime, no criminal charges had been filed against Zellmer. The trial court largely denied\nthe motion. Zellmer filed a notice of appeal from that decision and submitted his first\nbrief on May 14, 2007. When Zellmer appealed following his murder conviction, the two\nappeals were consolidated for review. The remedy when evidence is improperly seized,\nhowever, is exclusion.     See, e.g.. State v. Riley. 121 Wn.2d 22, 30, 846 P.2d 1365\n(1993). Here, the State used at trial only one piece of evidence that was seized during\nthe search.      The existence and substance of that evidence was independently\nestablished by Stacey. Thus, there is no additional remedy available for the issues\nraised in Zellmer's first appeal, and we do not evaluate those arguments.\n\n\n                                               16\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/17\n\n\n\n\nattorney alleged contained privileged materials. The investigators never looked at the\n\nchallenged documents again.\n\n      Detectives discovered and read one brief document on Zellmer's computer called\n\n\"accident.doc\" that explained the drowning incident.    They noted that the version of\n\nevents in the document was different than other statements by Zellmer.          But, the\n\ndocument did not appear privileged on its face and did not contain any language that\n\nsuggested it was written for a lawyer.     Even so, the document was later deemed\n\nprivileged and excluded.\n\n      This search and seizure is quite distinguishable from the purposeful intrusion in\n\nPerrow where the detective knew documents were privileged when he analyzed them\n\nand sent them on to the prosecutor's office. 156 Wn. App. at 326. Instead, detectives\n\nhere took measures to isolate and avoid reviewing privileged materials. And, there is no\n\nevidence that they communicated the content of privileged documents to the\n\nprosecutor's office. Detectives did nothing analogous to eavesdropping on Zellmer's\n\nconversations with his attorney, reading defense counsel's trial notes, or searching\n\nZellmer's jail cell to discover confidential communications. Any State intrusion into\n\nZellmer's attorney-client privilege during the search and seizure of documents from\n\nZellmer's home was neither deliberate nor egregious.\n\n      Moreover, none of the information seized from Zellmer's home concerned his\n\nrelationship with his defense counsel, except the computer document that did not\n\nappear privileged on its face and was excluded at trial. Rather, the allegedly privileged\n\ndocuments were communications with attorneys related to prior divorces, custody\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/18\n\n\n\ndisputes, and the wrongful death lawsuit.        The trial court reasoned that having\n\nrelationships with attorneys, and having those documents in his home, did not shield\n\nZellmer from an otherwise lawful search.      To automatically dismiss a case on such\n\ngrounds would be absurd, because if a defendant had any prior relationship with an\n\nattorney, he could claim governmental intrusion into his attorney-client privilege in those\n\nother matters.     Such a   rule would hinder effective law enforcement and lead to\n\nunnecessary dismissals.6\n      The State also obtained an insurance file from Zellmer's homeowner insurance\n\ncarrier that concerned whether the insurer had an obligation to represent Zellmer in the\n\nwrongful death case. Zellmer told his insurance company a different version of events\n\nthan he was alleging in the criminal case.        The State believed the file had high\n\nevidentiary value and disputed Zellmer's position that the file was privileged. The court\n\nconcluded that the file, which apparently was not taken from Zellmer's home, was not\n\nobtained directly or indirectly by government intrusion. And, the file did not enhance the\n\nState's strategy, because Zellmer had already made admissible inconsistent statements\n\nabout what happened the night of Ashley's drowning.\n\n       The trial court effectively isolated any potential prejudice from the challenged\n\ndocuments.       Exercising an abundance of caution, the court deemed all disputed\n\nmaterials privileged and excluded them from trial, including the insurance file. And, the\n\ncourt concluded that the State did not gain any benefit from seeing the brief\n\n\n       6 Indeed, the dissent in Perrow explained that a \"shrewd defense attorney, in\neither a civil or criminal case, would be wise to 'inadvertently' send a privileged\ndocument to the plaintiffs counsel and then seek dismissal of the pending civil or\ncriminal case.\" 156 Wn. App at 340 (Korsmo, A.C.J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                                18\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/19\n\n\n\n\n\"accident.doc\" or the insurance file, because the State already had other evidence of\n\nZellmer's inconsistent version of events. This is the proper analysis under Weatherford.\n\nSimply because the State saw potentially privileged materials does not require a\n\npresumption of prejudice and dismissal. See State v. Webbe. 122 Wn. App. 683, 697,\n\n94 P.3d 994 (2004) (refusing to presume prejudice where prosecutors saw privileged\n\nnotes from defense counsel's meeting with defendant, which included a discussion of\n\nthe pending charges). Moreover, the court found that the State made an affirmative\n\nshowing of lack of prejudice to Zellmer. Therefore, the court acted well within its\n\ndiscretion by excluding any allegedly privileged material from trial, but denying dismissal\n\nof the case because Zellmer showed no prejudice.\n\n II.   ER 404(b) Evidence\n\n       After an extensive pretrial hearing, the trial court allowed the State to introduce\n\nevidence of three prior incidents in which children were harmed while in Zellmer's care.\n\nThe court admitted the incidents under ER 404(b) as evidence of Zellmer's overarching\n\nplan to orchestrate a child's death in order to collect insurance proceeds. Zellmer\n\nargues that the trial court erred in admitting this evidence, because the incidents were\n\naccidents and therefore could not be part of a purposeful plan. Zellmer also contends\n\nthat the incidents were not markedly similar to one another and to Ashley's drowning.\n\n       We review a trial court's decision to admit evidence under ER 404(b) for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. State v. DeVincentis. 150 Wn.2d 11, 17, 74 P.3d 119 (2003). Contrary to\n\nZellmer's argument, ER 404 errors are not of constitutional magnitude.            State v.\n\nJackson, 102 Wn.2d 689, 695, 689 P.2d 76 (1984). To be admitted under ER 404(b),\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/20\n\n\n\nprior acts must be (1) proved by a preponderance of the evidence, (2) admitted for the\n\npurpose of proving a common plan or scheme, (3) relevant to prove an element of the\n\ncrime charged or to rebut a defense, and (4) more probative than prejudicial. State v.\n\nLough. 125 Wn.2d 847, 852, 854, 889 P.2d 487 (1995).\n\n      Prior and current acts need not be identical to be admissible as common plan or\n\nscheme evidence.      DeVincentis, 150 Wn.2d at 21.        Rather, there need only be a\n\nsubstantial similarity between the prior bad acts and the charged crime. Jd Substantial\n\nsimilarity is shown when the acts demonstrate such a concurrence of common features\n\nthat they may naturally be explained as individual manifestations of a general plan. Jd\n\nThis includes markedly similar acts of misconduct against similar victims under similar\n\ncircumstances.     Lough. 125 Wn.2d at 855-56.       Uncompleted manifestations of an\n\noverarching plan may also be admissible. State v. Roth, 75 Wn. App. 808, 822 n.8, 881\n\nP.2d 268 (1994).\n\n   A. Mitchell Komendant\n\n\n      The first incident admitted involved four month old Mitchell Komendant, whose\n\nlegs were suspiciously fractured while in Zellmer's care.      Zellmer added uninsured\n\nmotorist coverage to the couple's automobile insurance shortly after he and Stacey\n\nKomendant were married in 1990. Zellmer then claimed Mitchell was injured in a car\n\naccident, filed an accident report, and attempted to collect from the insurer. But, he\n\nlater admitted to Mitchell's mother that there was no accident. The State argued this\n\nwas the beginning of Zellmer's overarching plan to marry single mothers and injure their\n\nyoung children in order to profit from insurance claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/21\n\n\n\n          Zellmer claims that there is no evidence as to what caused Mitchell's injuries.\n\nAnd, he argues that the incident is not markedly similar to the other incidents, because\n\nthe financial motive to collect insurance only arose after Mitchell was injured. These\n\narguments are not supported by the record. The court found by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that Zellmer was clearly the agent of Mitchell's injuries.       This is readily\n\napparent, because the injury occurred while the child was in Zellmer's care and he\n\nfabricated the accident.     And, the incident is markedly similar to Ashley's drowning,\n\nbecause Zellmer married a single mother with a young child, orchestrated an injury to\n\nhis step-child left in his care, then attempted to collect insurance proceeds from the\n\ninjury.\n\n          The court concluded that the common plan or scheme was \"a fairly obvious one\n\nhere of fabricating injury to property, to Mr. Zellmer himself, and to very young children\n\nwho were not biologically Mr. Zellmer's, only legally his.\" The court found that the\n\nevidence was relevant as one of the incidents in Zellmer's overarching plan, \"extremely\n\nrelevant\" to the State's claim of premeditation, and relevant to show Zellmer's\n\nknowledge of how to make insurance claims.             The court acknowledged that the\n\nevidence was prejudicial, but not unfairly so within the meaning of ER 404(b). The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n    B. Kyle Clauson\n\n          The second incident admitted involved Kyle Clauson, who was less than a year\n\nold and still in the crawling stage of his development when he nearly drowned in a hot\n\ntub while in Zellmer's care. The child would have had to climb several steps to enter the\n\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/22\n\n\n\n\nhot tub, and the hot tub was normally covered by a heavy lid. The State argued that this\n\nincident was an uncompleted manifestation of Zellmer's plan to murder a child by\n\nmaking it appear that the child accidentally fell into a body of water.        The State\n\nmaintained that Zellmer used this incident to test how a single mother would react and\n\nto see if she accepted his explanation.\n\n      Zellmer argues that the court found no evidence that he intentionally injured Kyle.\n\nThis argument is unsupported by the record. The court stated that it admitted the\n\nevidence in part for the purpose of showing lack of accident. The facts of the incident\n\nsupport that decision.   Zellmer also argues that this event is distinguishable from\n\nAshley's drowning, because he had no potential insurance gain and there was no actual\n\ninjury to Kyle. It is true that Zellmer and Clauson were not married and that Zellmer did\n\nnot have a life insurance policy taken out on Kyle. But, other aspects of the incident are\n\nstrikingly similar to Ashley's death. Zellmer was left alone with a single mother's young\n\nchild and the child somehow fell in a body of water, even though the child's\n\ndevelopmental characteristics made it highly unlikely that he would have crawled into\n\nthe hot tub by himself. Zellmer then had the opportunity to gauge the mother's reaction\n\nto his explanation that it was an accident.      Characterization of the incident as an\n\nuncompleted manifestation of Zellmer's alleged overarching scheme is not inconsistent\n\nwith our case law. And, as such, uncompleted or individual manifestations of an\n\noverarching plan may be admitted as ER 404(b) evidence. DeVincentis, 150 Wn.2d at\n\n19-21: Roth. 75 Wn. App. at 822 n.8.\n\n\n\n\n                                               22\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/23\n\n\n\n      The court acknowledged that the evidence was prejudicial. But, the court found\n\nthat this evidence had \"extreme probative value,\" because it was good evidence of\n\nZellmer's overarching plan or preparation to move quickly into a relationship with a\n\nsingle mother, injure her young child in what appeared to be an accidental way, then\n\n\"see if he was essentially able to sell it.\"   On balance, the probative value of this\n\nevidence outweighed the resulting prejudice. The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin admitting this evidence.\n\n   C. Madison Barnett\n\n       The third incident admitted involved four year old Madison Barnett, who fell in\n\nZellmer's pool in December 2002, a year before Ashley's drowning. Zellmer proposed\n\nto a single mother with a young daughter after a brief whirlwind romance. Zellmer soon\n\nbroached the subject of life insurance with her. Then, Zellmer seized the opportunity to\n\ngauge her response to her daughter accidentally falling in Zellmer's pool. This fits\nwithin Zellmer's larger scheme of testing mothers' responses to their children\n\naccidentally falling in bodies of water. The court also thought it \"interesting that Mr.\nZellmer and the child are out in December near the pool considering the overarching\n\nscheme and plan the State says reached its fruition with Ashley's murder.\"\n\n       The court found that this incident was an accident, because Madison admitted\n\nshe was reaching for goggles that were in the pool and fell in. As a result, the court did\nnot consider the incident to be \"all that prejudicial, because nobody's arguing that it\n\nwasn't an accident.\" But, the court believed the evidence was probative and admissible,\n\nbecause it had many of the same features as Ashley's drowning.            And, the court\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/24\n\n\n\n\nproperly limited both the prejudice and probative value by not allowing the State to\n\nargue that this evidence showed lack of accident. The court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin admitting this evidence as an uncompleted manifestation of Zellmer's overarching\n\nplan.\n\n III.   Exclusion of a Spectator from Trial\n\n        Zellmer argues that the trial court violated his right to a public trial and the\n\npublic's right to access court proceedings by excluding the fifteen year old son of a\n\nwitness from the courtroom during trial.         The United States and Washington\n\nConstitutions guarantee a defendant's right to a public trial. U.S. Const, amend. VI;\n\nConst, art. I, § 22. And, justice in all cases must be administered openly, granting the\n\npublic an interest in open, accessible proceedings. Const, art. I, § 10; Seattle Times\n\nCo. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 36, 640 P.2d 716 (1982).         To determine whether a\n\ncourtroom closure is appropriate, courts must consider five factors and enter specific\n\nfindings on the record to justify the closure. State v. Lormor, 172 Wn.2d 85, 91 n.1,257\n\nP.3d 624 (2011).\n\n        The Washington Supreme Court recently held in Lormor that exclusion of one\n\nperson does not constitute a courtroom closure and therefore does not implicate the\n\ndefendant's public trial right. Jd. at 87. Rather, a closure occurs when the courtroom is\n\ncompletely and purposefully closed to spectators so no one may enter or leave. Jd at\n\n93. Consequently, a trial court's decision to exclude one spectator is a matter of\n\ncourtroom operations, reviewed for abuse of discretion. Jd at 94. The Lormor court\n\nlikened this broad discretion to the trial court's power under ER 615 to exclude\n\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/25\n\n\n\n\nwitnesses so they cannot hear testimony of other witnesses. Jd at 94. But, the trial\n\ncourt must still exercise caution in removing a spectator and articulate its reasons for\n\ndoing so on the record.       Jd   However, Zellmer is incorrect that exclusion of one\n\nspectator requires the five factor analysis and specific findings for a true courtroom\n\nclosure. See id at 94-95.\n\n       Here, the trial court excluded a teenager whose father, Joe Wickersham, was\n\nscheduled to testify later that day. Zellmer argues that the teenager was excluded\n\nbecause he was a minor. But, he mischaracterizes the record. Before the court knew\n\nthe boy was a witness's son, it said, \"It's fine. It's fine to have an escorted child here.\n\nIt's Dad's decision whether to bring a child to this case. I wouldn't, but it's his call.\" But,\n\nthe court had already excluded witnesses from the courtroom under ER 615, including\n\nWickersham, the boy's father. The court excluded the teenager specifically because it\n\nwas \"not confident\" that he would not repeat to his father what was going on in court,\n\nwhich would interfere with the ER 615 order.\n\n       It was well within the trial court's discretion to exclude the boy to protect its ER\n\n615 ruling and prevent him from passing information on to his father. This helped\n\npreserve the integrity of court proceedings and was sufficient to support the boy's\n\nexclusion. And, the court properly articulated its reason for removal on the record, as\n\nrequired by Lormor. There is no evidence that the court excluded the boy because he\n\nwas a minor, so we need not consider whether that would be within the court's\n\ndiscretion. There is no error.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/26\n\n\n\nIV.      Expert Tracker Testimony\n\n        Zellmer argues that the trial court improperly admitted expert testimony from two\n\ndifferent trackers.\n\n\n      A. Testimony About Crime Scene Photographs\n\n         Zellmer argues that expert tracker Joel Hardin should not have been allowed to\n\ntestify about his analysis of crime scene photographs taken by police investigators on\n\nthe night of Ashley's drowning. Zellmer contends that Hardin's experience is with live,\n\nin-person tracking, not analyzing photographs. Zellmer therefore argues that Hardin's\n\ntestimony was not based on reliable science, exceeded Hardin's expertise, and was not\n\nhelpful to the jury.\n\n         At trial, Zellmer objected to Hardin's opinion that Ashley did not walk across the\n\nback deck and moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. We review both a trial\n\ncourt's decision to admit expert testimony and to deny a motion for a mistrial for abuse\n\nof discretion.    State v. Ortiz, 119 Wn.2d 294, 308, 831 P.2d 1060 (1992); State v.\n\nHopson, 113Wn.2d273, 284, 778 P.2d 1014(1989). Expert testimony will be admitted\n\nwhen (1) the witness qualifies as an expert, (2) the opinion is based on a theory\n\ngenerally accepted in the relevant scientific community, and (3) the testimony is helpful\n\nto the trier of fact. State v. Cheatam. 150 Wn.2d 626, 645, 81 P.3d 830 (2003).\n\n         We have previously rejected the same argument Zellmer makes here involving\n\nthe same tracker who testified at Zellmer's trial. State v. Groth. 163 Wn. App. 548, 563,\n\n261 P.3d 183 (2011). In Groth, Hardin analyzed decades old crime scene photographs\n\nto determine whether any evidence showed that Groth's Vibram brand shoes were at\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/27\n\n\n\n\nthe scene. Jd. at 555-56. Hardin testified that there were two sets of footprints in the\n\nphotographs—one matching the victim's shoes and the other matching Groth's shoes.\n\nJd at 556.    We concluded that Hardin's training and experience allowed him to\n\nformulate conclusions solely from the photographs. Jd at 563-64.\n\n       The facts and circumstances of Zellmer's case are almost identical to Groth.7\n\nInvestigators gave Hardin Ashley's shoes and photographs from the scene years after\n\nthe drowning. They asked Hardin to determine if there was any evidence that Ashley\n\nstepped in cake frosting then walked across the deck and down the stairs to the pool.\n\nHardin testified that he found remnants of cake frosting in the sole of Ashley's shoe.\n\nBut, he found no evidence of frosting tracked from Ashley's shoe on the deck or down\n\nthe stairs.\n\n\n       Examining photographs for evidence of Ashley's shoeprints is well within\n\nHardin's expertise.    Hardin has 40 years of experience examining footprint evidence.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court recognizes his tracking expertise. Ortiz, 119 Wn.2d at\n\n310 (holding that Hardin was qualified as expert based on his extensive training and\n\nthousands of hours of experience). And, Hardin's testimony was helpful to the jury,\n\nbecause his can recognize and interpret signs that a lay person would overlook. Groth,\n\n163 Wn. App. at 564.\n\n       Lastly, Hardin's analysis of photographs does not preclude his testimony. Jd at\n\n563-64. Rather, it goes to the weight the jury gives it. Ortiz, 119 Wn.2d at 311. Just\n\n\n\n\n       7 The only difference appears to be that in Groth, Hardin analyzed whether the\nsole matched specific footprints, while in Zellmer's case, he analyzed whether any\nfootprints could be identified as originating from the sole.\n\n\n                                              27\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/28\n\n\n\n\nlike in Groth, Hardin was subjected to searching cross-examination. Defense counsel\n\npointed out the shortcomings of Hardin analyzing photographs, as opposed to real-time\n\ntracking.   A defense expert contradicted Hardin's conclusions.        Tracking is not so\n\ntechnical a discipline that the jurors could not draw independent conclusions about the\n\nreliability of Hardin's testimony. Ortiz. 119 Wn.2d at 311. The trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in admitting Hardin's expert testimony or denying Zellmer's subsequent\n\nmotion for a mistrial on that basis.\n\n   B. Confrontation Clause\n\n\n       Zellmer argues that a second tracker's testimony violated his right to confront\n\nwitnesses against him. Kathleen Decker testified as an expert tracker in the State's\n\nrebuttal case. Decker explained that she, Hardin, and a third tracker, Sharon Ward,\n\nworked on a team to analyze crime scene photographs. Decker testified that \"we were\n\nin agreement and still are in agreement to our opinion\" that Ashley did not walk across\n\nthe deck.   She continued, \"We were not able to see any sign made from [Ashley's]\n\nsandal.\"    Zellmer argues that Decker's use of the word \"we\" constitutes opinion\n\ntestimony from a witness who did not testify at trial, violating the confrontation clause of\n\nthe Sixth Amendment and article I, section 22 of the Washington Constitution.\n\nHowever, defense counsel failed to object to Decker's testimony.8 Therefore, Zellmer\nhas waived the issue absent manifest constitutional error.        RAP 2.5(a)(3).    Even a\n\nmanifest constitutional error may be subject to harmless error analysis. Kirkman. 159\n\n\n       8 Zellmer claims that he did object, citing the previous day's transcript. But,\ndefense counsel only objected to the cumulative nature of Decker's testimony, not that\nshe would be testifying about the opinion of a third non-testifying tracker, in violation of\nthe confrontation clause.\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/29\n\n\n\nWn.2d at 927.      A constitutional error is harmless if we are convinced beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that any reasonable jury would have reached the same result absent\n\nthe error. State v. Gulov, 104Wn.2d412, 425, 705 P.2d 1182 (1985)\n\n      Here, Decker's \"we\" testimony was harmless.        The jury already heard similar\n\ntestimony from Hardin. And, Zellmer's defense expert mounted a compelling rebuttal\n\nundermining Hardin's conclusions that were the same as Decker's. Moreover, Decker's\n\n\"we\" testimony was exceptionally limited in light of Zellmer's entire six week trial. And,\n\nshe mentioned Ward only once. Decker's testimony is also readily distinguishable from\n\nBullcominq v. New Mexico. _U.S._, 131 S. Ct. 2705, 2709, 180 L Ed. 2d 610 (2011).\n\nThere, the State's principal evidence was a forensic lab report certifying Bullcoming's\n\nhigh blood alcohol concentration. Jd Instead of calling the certifying analyst, though,\n\nthe State called another analyst who was familiar with the lab's testing procedures, but\n\nhad neither participated in nor observed the blood sample test. Jd. The Court held that\n\nthis \"surrogate testimony\" violated Bullcoming's right to confront witnesses against him.\nJd at 2710. In contrast, Decker was not a surrogate analyst—she actively participated\n\nin the tracking analysis. She testified about her own conclusions, which corresponded\nto the team's conclusions. And, her testimony was not the State's principal evidence\n\nagainst Zellmer. Therefore, we hold that any error resulting from Decker's testimony\n\nwas harmless.\n\n\n V.    Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n       Zellmer argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury's sympathy\n\nfor the victim's family in his closing argument. He contends that these arguments were\n\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/30\n\n\n\noutside the evidence and served no valid purpose except to arouse the jury's sympathy\n\nfor the family and hostility toward him. Prosecutorial misconduct requires a showing\n\nthat the prosecutor's conduct was both improper and prejudicial. State v. Monday. 171\n\nWn.2d 667, 675, 257 P.3d 551 (2011). The appellant bears the burden of establishing\n\nthe impropriety of the statements and their prejudicial effect. State v. Anderson, 153\n\nWn. App. 417, 427, 220 P.3d 1273 (2009). The prosecutor's improper statements are\n\nprejudicial only where there is a substantial likelihood that the misconduct affected the\n\njury's verdict. State v. Yates. 161 Wn.2d 714, 774, 168 P.3d 359 (2007). We must\n\nexamine the prosecutor's conduct in the full trial context, including the evidence\n\npresented, the total argument, and the issues in the case. Monday. 171 Wn.2d at 675.\n\n      Prosecutorial misconduct arises when the State refers to evidence outside the\n\nrecord or makes bald appeals to passion or prejudice. State v. Fisher. 165 Wn.2d 727,\n\n747, 202 P.3d 937 (2009). But, in closing argument, the prosecutor has wide latitude in\n\nmaking arguments to the jury and drawing reasonable inferences from admitted\n\nevidence. Anderson, 153 Wn. App. at 427-28. When raised for the first time on appeal,\n\nreversal is only required if the conduct was so flagrant and ill-intentioned that no\n\ncurative jury instruction could have corrected the prejudice. State v. Warren. 165 Wn.2d\n\n17,43, 195 P.3d 940 (2008).\n\n      Zellmer assigns errors to two groups of statements by the prosecutor. The first\n\nare toward the beginning of the prosecutor's closing. The prosecutor told the jury that\n\nhe was not going to replay videos of Ashley taken by her father shortly before she was\n\nkilled, \"because members of little Ashley's family, are present.\" And, the prosecutor told\n\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/31\n\n\n\n\nthe jury he would not show them the photos of Ashley's autopsy again, because \"I'm\n\nsure you can imagine how much pain Ashley's family has been through and we don't\n\nneed to put them through any more.\"           Defense counsel did not object to these\n\nstatements. Zellmer makes no argument as to why these statements were flagrant and\n\nill-intentioned, instead addressing the cumulative effect of the prosecutor's statements.\n\n       The second group of statements came at the end of the prosecutor's closing\n\nargument, after 30 pages of argument in the record. The prosecutor recognized that\n\nZeller is \"entitled to his day in court and he's gotten it.\" But, \"[h]e's not the only person\n\ndeserving of something here.\" The prosecutor then made the following argument, to\n\nwhich Zellmer assigns error:\n\n              If Ashley McLellan had survived her exposure to the defendant, she\n       would have celebrated her tenth birthday just six days ago.\n\n              If the defendant hadn't taken her life from her, she'd probably be in\n       fourth grade and like any other fourth grader, she'd be putting the last of\n       her baby teeth under the pillow for the tooth fairy, maybe starting to read\n       longer books without as many pictures.\n\nThe trial court overruled defense counsel's objection to this line of argument.          The\n\nprosecutor continued, describing Ashley playing with her little sister or asking her\n\nparents for a cell phone.       Defense counsel again objected and the court again\n\noverruled.\n\n\n       The prosecutor went on to say:\n\n            Stacey would be standing on the sidelines during Ashley's soccer\n       games, tucking her into bed at night, probably turning a night light on on\n       the way out of the room.\n\n             Her dad, Bruce, like any other father, probably would be watching\n       Ashley like any other ten-year-old girl dancing around the room with her\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/32\n\n\n      friends to whatever ridiculous Hannah Montana song was big at the\n      moment.\n\n\n              Instead, Stacey and Bruce live with broken hearts for the rest of\n      their lives knowing their daughter was murdered.\n\nDefense counsel objected that this was a claim of compassion. The court noted the\n\nobjection and overruled.\n\n      The prosecutor reiterated that \"Stacey and Bruce deserve something now too.\"\n\nHe continued with a hypothetical of Ashley's grandparents looking at a photo of their\n\ngranddaughter's latest artwork on their refrigerator. He said that Ashley's grandparents\n\nare \"entitled to something now too.\" Then he finished:\n\n             All of those people and many others you heard in the courtroom\n      have had one of the precious things in their life, maybe the most precious\n      thing in their life, taken from them by the defendant.\n\n\n\n             Her parents are [sic], her grandparents, her aunts and uncles, all\n      the people who loved her, the people of the State of Washington.\n\n\n\n              All those people deserve one thing, they deserve justice. They're\n      entitled to a guilty verdict.\n\nDefense counsel renewed his objection in the middle of these final remarks, but it was\n\nagain overruled.\n\n      Immediately after the prosecutor's argument, the trial court instructed the jury:\n\n      I'm going to remind you yet again of something that we've been telling you\n      from the beginning of the case, that is that the purpose of the trial is to\n      assess whether the State has or has not proved the elements of the\n      charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n             And that's your objective with that assessment.\n\nThe court then dismissed the jury for recess before the defense's closing argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/33\n\n\n\n       Before the jury was brought back in from recess, defense counsel renewed his\n\nobjections to the prosecutor's closing remarks. He asked the court to instruct the jury\n\nthat they should not base their decision on appeals to passion or prejudice. The court\n\nreminded defense counsel of its limiting instruction to the jury before recess. And, the\n\ncourt explained, that instruction was one \"they have gotten very clearly from the first\n\nmoment they've come into my courtroom that's been repeated for them many times and\n\nI'm clear that they understand it.\" But, the court suggested that defense counsel remind\n\nthe jury of the instruction that \"they may not let their emotions overcome their rational\n\nthought process and have to reach their decision based on the law given to them not on\n\nsympathy, prejudice, or personal preference.\"        Defense counsel did so shortly after\n\nbeginning his closing argument.\n\n      A trial court's decision on prosecutorial misconduct is given deference on appeal.\n\nState v. Luvene, 127 Wn.2d 690, 701, 903 P.2d 960 (1995). This is because the trial\n\ncourt is in the best position to most effectively determine if prosecutorial misconduct\n\nprejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial. Id Here, the trial court believed that the\n\nprosecutor's comments were not an appeal to the jury's passion or prejudice.\n\nMoreover, the first jury instruction, given right before the State's closing argument,\n\nstated, \"It is your duty to decide the facts in this case based upon the evidence\n\npresented to you during this trial.\" That same instruction also said, \"You must not let\n\nyour emotions overcome your rational thought process. You must reach your decision\n\nbased on the facts proved to you and on the law given to you, not on sympathy,\n\nprejudice, or personal preference.\" Immediately after the prosecutor's closing, the court\n\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/34\n\n\n\nreminded the jury of the State's burden of proof in an \"excess of caution.\" The court\n\nalso explained that this instruction was reiterated to the jury throughout trial, so the court\n\nwas certain \"that they understand it.\" We presume that the jury was able to follow the\n\ncourt's instruction. Warren, 165 Wn.2d at 28.\n\n       Examining the prosecutor's comments in the full context of the trial, Zellmer has\n\nfailed to demonstrate that there is a substantial likelihood that they prejudiced the\n\noutcome of his trial.9 The prosecutor spoke for 30 pages about all the evidence against\nZellmer, including how unlikely it was that Ashley would have ventured out in the dark\n\nby herself. The prosecutor reminded the jury of prior incidents involving children\n\nsuspiciously injured in Zellmer's care. And, the prosecutor pointed out inconsistencies\n\nin Zellmer's version of events the night of the incident. The comments about the victim\n\nand her survivors' losses were not flagrant and ill-intentioned as to warrant a new trial.\n\nVI.    Unanimous Special Verdict Instruction\n\n       Zellmer argues that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it must be\n\nunanimous to answer \"no\" on the special verdict form supporting an aggravated\n\nsentence, in violation of State v. Bashaw, 169 Wn.2d 133, 234 P.3d 195 (2010),\n\n      9 The cases that Zellmer cites to the contrary do not control here. First, the\ncases he cites to argue that the prosecutor may not ask the jury to put itself in the\nposition of the victim's family or ask for justice for the victim's family are both out-of-\nstate cases. State v. Adamcik, 152 Idaho 445, 272 P.3d 417 (2012); Edwards v. State,\n428 So. 2d 357 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983). Second, State v. Pierce is distinguishable.\n169 Wn. App. 533, 280 P.3d 1158, review denied. 175 Wn.2d 1025, 291 P.3d 253\n(2012). In that case, the prosecutor in closing fabricated an entire interaction between\nthe defendant and his victims just before he murdered them. Jd at 543. The prosecutor\nalso created an internal dialogue the defendant had with himself before deciding to rob\nand murder the victims, which the prosecutor told in a first person narrative during\nclosing. Jd at 542. Such argument had absolutely no basis in the record and\nimproperly asked the jurors to step into both the victim's and the defendant's the shoes.\nId. at 555.\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/35\n\n\n\n\noverruled bv State v. Nunez. 174 Wn.2d 707, 285 P.3d 21 (2012). The instruction read,\n\nin relevant part: \"In order to answer the special verdict form(s) 'yes,' you must\n\nunanimously be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 'yes' is the correct answer. If\n\nyou unanimously have a reasonable doubt as to this question, you must answer 'no.'\"\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court recently overruled Bashaw and expressly upheld an\n\ninstruction identical to the one given here. Nunez, 174 Wn.2d at 710. There is no error.\n\nVII.   Question from Deliberating Jury\n\n       Zellmer argues that the court improperly answered a question from the\n\ndeliberating jury without apprising him and without an in-court discussion, thereby\n\nviolating his constitutional right to be present. A criminal defendant has a fundamental\n\nright to be present at all critical stages of a trial. State v. Irbv, 170 Wn.2d 874, 880, 246\n\nP.3d 796 (2011). The right exists whenever the defendant's presence has a reasonably\n\nsubstantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge. Jd at\n\n881. The right only exists to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by\n\nthe defendant's absence. Jd Thus, there is no right to be present when the defendant's\n\n\"'presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow.'\" Jd. (quoting Snvder v.\n\nMassachusetts. 291 U.S. 97, 106-07, 54 S. Ct. 330, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934), overruled in\n\npart sub nom Mallov v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1968)). The\n\ndefendant does not have a right to be present during conferences between the court\n\nand counsel on legal matters, unless it requires a resolution of disputed facts.        In re\n\nPers. Restraint of Lord. 123 Wn.2d 296, 306, 868 P.2d 835, clarified bv, 123 Wn.2d\n\n737, 870 P.2d 964 (1994). So long as defense counsel is present, the trial court is\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/36\n\n\n\n\npermitted to give the jury information on a point of law in the defendant's absence.\n\nState v.Brown. 29 Wn. App. 11, 16, 627 P.2d 132 (1981).\n\n        During deliberations, the jury asked the court:\n\n               Is manslaughter in the 1st degree a lesser included offense of\n        murder in the 1st or 2nd degree?\n\n              What are the elements of manslaughter in the 1st degree?\n\n               Is that an option available to us?\n\n        The court conferred with counsel by speakerphone. The court then responded in\n\nwriting, \"In this case, manslaughter in the first degree is not a lesser included offense\n\nthat you can consider.\" Whether manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder is\n\na pure legal issue.     Because the trial court consulted with defense counsel, it was\n\npermitted to respond to the jury's legal question without Zellmer being present. Any\n\nbenefit of Zellmer being at this purely legal discussion is not apparent. There was no\n\nviolation of Zellmer's constitutional right to be present.\n\nVIII.   Cumulative Error\n\n        Zellmer contends that cumulative error affected the outcome of his case. Where\n\nseveral errors standing alone do not warrant reversal, the cumulative error doctrine\n\n requires reversal when the combined effects of the errors denied the defendant a fair\n\ntrial. State v. Coe. 101 Wn.2d 772, 789, 684 P.2d 668 (1984). The only error here was\n\n allowing Kathleen Decker to testify briefly about a third non-testifying tracker's opinion.\n\n That error was harmless. The cumulative error doctrine does not apply here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/37\n\n\n\nIX.     Unsealed Documents\n\n\n        Zellmer argues that the trial court improperly unsealed documents involving his\n\nrequests for expert funding and claims that his attorney-client privilege was violated. He\n\nasserts that the trial court applied the incorrect legal test for determining whether to\n\nunseal the documents. The State concedes that when the trial court initially considered\n\nthe request to unseal records in December 2010, it applied the multi-factor Ishikawa\n\ntest.   But, the court stayed the unsealing so that defense counsel could review the\n\nrecords and make specific redaction requests.         In January 2011, the Washington\n\nSupreme Court held that unsealing such records should be determined with reference\n\nto GR 15(e) rather than the Ishikawa test. Yakima County v. Yakima Herald-Republic,\n\n170 Wn.2d 775, 802-03, 246 P.3d 768 (2011). In light of this new law, Zellmer moved\n\nfor reconsideration of the trial court's unsealing order. On March 16, 2011, the court\n\ndenied Zellmer's motion, finding that unsealing was warranted under GR 15(e).\n\n        In a supplemental assignment of error, Zellmer argues that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for reconsideration, because it did not explain how the State met the\n\nGR 15(e) requirements and did not hold an in-court hearing. GR 15(e)(2) provides that\n\na \"sealed court record in a criminal case shall be ordered unsealed only upon proof of\n\ncompelling circumstances.\" Zellmer argues that the trial court's order stating only that\n\n\"in the Court's view, the requirements of GR 15 have been met\" is insufficient proof of\n\ncompelling circumstances. Zellmer asks this court to remand the case for a hearing on\n\nthe issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/38\n\n\n\n\n      However, GR 15(e) nowhere requires the court to hold a hearing to find proof of\n\ncompelling circumstances. And, Zellmer cites no other statutory authority or case law\n\nthat requires a court to do so. RAP 10.3(a)(6); State v. McNeair, 88 Wn. App. 331, 340,\n\n944 P.2d 1099 (1997) (failure to cite authority constitutes a concession that the\n\nargument lacks merit). Moreover, the trial court stated in the order that it found the GR\n\n15 requirements met based on its consideration of the defense motion and the State's\n\nresponse. The State discussed the compelling circumstances for unsealing at length in\n\nits response.   Clearly the trial court found this to be sufficient proof of compelling\n\ncircumstances. No hearing was required.\n\n      Zellmer also argues that State v. McEnroe entitles him to an opportunity to\n\nwithdraw the previously sealed documents containing privileged materials. 174 Wn.2d\n\n795, 279 P.3d 861 (2012). But, Zellmer's reliance on McEnroe is misplaced. The\n\nMcEnroe court held that only documents submitted with a motion to seal may be\n\nwithdrawn if the motion is denied. Jd at 798. McEnroe does mean that a defendant has\n\nthe right to withdraw documents filed under seal if the State later seeks to unseal those\n\ndocuments, as is the case here. There is no error.\n\n      We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              -PC-\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n   s^Ya^j                                            ^•^1\n\n\n                                               38\n\f",

Two\n\nweeks later, Zellmer proposed in front of his friends and Stacey said yes to avoid\n\nembarrassing him.     Although she had reservations about getting married, Stacey\n\ndecided to go through with the wedding after she became pregnant in July. They were\n\nmarried in September 2003, and Stacey and her three year old daughter, Ashley\n\nMcLellan, moved into Zellmer's home. .\n\n      Stacey worked full-time as an office manager at a chiropractic clinic. Zellmer did\n\nnot work. He initially told Stacey that he was a semi-retired police officer and firefighter\n\nthat now did day trading.    Later, Stacey learned that Zellmer was actually collecting\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/2\n\n\n\n\nbenefits from the Washington Department of Labor and Industries (L&l).           Zellmer\n\nshowed Stacey a medical book and explained the different things he needed to prove to\n\nget a full L&l pension. He told her that he had a doctor in his back pocket who would\n\nwrite anything Zellmer wanted him to write. Stacey did not think Zellmer had actual\n\nimpairments and believed he was capable of working.\n\n      Soon after the wedding, Zellmer suggested they obtain life insurance policies on\n\nStacey and Ashley. Stacey went along with it. They obtained a $200,000 policy on\n\nAshley's life. They also took out policiesfor Zellmer's sons, Dakota and Levi.\n\n      Their relationship was tumultuous, and Stacey and Ashley moved back and forth\n\nbetween Stacey's parents' home and Zellmer's home. Ashley became increasingly\n\nuncomfortable around Zellmer.      One time, Stacey noticed scrapes on Ashley, and\n\nAshley reported that Zellmer had pushed her. During arguments with Stacey, Zellmer\nthreatened that he knew how to use the legal system to obtain custody of their unborn\n\nchild. When Stacey threatened to report Zellmer's L&l fraud, Zellmer told her, \"you\n\nnever mess with a man's money.\"\n\n       On December 3, 2003, Stacey went to work and left Ashley at home in Zellmer's\n\ncare because Ashley had a high temperature and could not go to daycare.             That\n\nevening, Dakota called 911 and reported a drowning involving a three year old victim.\n\nEmergency responders arrived at Zellmer's residence and found Zellmer kneeling over\n\nAshley's body. Zellmer claimed he discovered Ashley floating at the deep end of the\n\npool, lifted her out, and carried her to the living room. He indicated that Ashley must\n\nhave gone outside to eat a cake that was left on the back porch, gone down to the pool\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/3\n\n\n\nto wash her hands so she would not get in trouble, and had accidentally fallen in. A\n\ncake box was on the back porch, directly outside the back door.            The pool is\n\napproximately 20 yards from the back door, down two flights of stairs, and at the end of\n\na concrete path. On that night, the deck was slippery, the temperature was in the 30s,\n\nand it was so dark that police officers needed a flashlight to see. Medical personnel\n\nwere unable to get any self-sustaining response from Ashley. She died in the hospital\n\non December 5, 2003.\n\n      The State charged Zellmer with murder in the first degree, murder in the second\n\ndegree, and theft in the first degree in June 2007. By amended information, the State\n\nadded two more counts of first-degree theft.1 The theft charges were severed from the\n\nmurder charges.\n\n      At trial, the State presented evidence of three incidents in which other young\n\nchildren were injured or suffered accidents while in Zellmer's care.         The State\n\nintroduced this evidence to argue that Zellmer had an overarching plan to marry single\n\nmothers, take out life insurance on their young children, then injure those children in\n\nseemingly accidental ways to collect insurance proceeds.\n\n      The first incident involved four month old Mitchell Komendant.       Shortly after\n\nZellmer and Stacey Komendant were married in 1990, Zellmer added uninsured\n\nmotorist coverage to their car insurance policy. Not long after, Zellmer encouraged\n\nKomendant to take Mitchell to the emergency room, because he seemed unusually\n\n\n       1 The theft charges alleged that Zellmer obtained control over (1) property\nbelonging to the State of Washington, (2) mortgage loan funds belonging to Ownit\nMortgage Company, and (3) insurance damage claim payments belonging to Allstate\nInsurance Company.\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/4\n\n\n\n\nfussy. Zellmer told emergency room staff that his car was rear-ended in a hit and run\n\nthe day before, and Mitchell had moved a little sideways in his car seat. The doctor\n\ntook x-rays, but found nothing.      The next day, Zellmer filed an accident report.\n\nKomendant saw Zellmer deliberately scratch the back of her car to make it seem like it\n\nhad been rear-ended.    He admitted to Komendant that there was no accident, but he\n\nwanted to make sure Mitchell's medical bills were covered, even though the doctor had\n\nfound nothing wrong at that point.\n\n      When Mitchell did not get better, Zellmer and Komendant took him back to the\n\ndoctor, who found fractures in both of Mitchell's legs. Zellmer gave a new story that a\n\nbriefcase fell from the back window onto Mitchell's legs during the purported accident.\n\nZellmer then attempted to recover the full $25,000 allowable under their insurance, even\n\nthough Mitchell's hospital bills did not amount to that much.\n\n       The second incident involved Kyle Clauson, who was less than a year old and\n\nstill in the crawling stage of his development at the time. In 2000, about a month into\n\nZellmer's relationship with Kelley Clauson, Zellmer was watching Kyle in his bedroom\n\nwhile Clauson fixed dinner.   Dakota called out to Clauson that Zellmer needed to see\n\nher right away. She found Kyle on the floor of Zellmer's bedroom dripping wet with a\n\nbluish pallor, and Zellmer standing over him, watching. For several minutes, Zellmer\n\nwould not let Clauson pick Kyle up. She finally did and slapped Kyle on the back to\n\nmake him cough up water. Zellmer told Clauson that Kyle had somehow crawled out of\n\nthe room and gotten into the hot tub outside and Zellmer rescued him. There was a\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/5\n\n\n\n\nthick, heavy cover on the hot tub. Clauson thought it unlikely that Kyle would have been\n\nable to crawl up the hot tub stairs and push the cover off.\n\n       The final incident involved four year old Madison Barnett. Zellmer and Madison's\n\nmother, Michelle Barnett, knew each other only a short time before Zellmer proposed.\n\nShortly after they were engaged, Zellmer suggested getting life insurance.         Barnett\n\nlaughed and responded, \"What are you going to do, bump me off?\" Zellmer got very\n\ndefensive and did not bring up the subject again. In December 2002, a year before\n\nAshley's drowning, Zellmer offered to take care of Madison while her mother was busy.\n\nWhen Barnett came home, she found Madison withdrawn, her head down, and in a\n\ndifferent set of clothes. Zellmer prodded Madison to tell her mother what happened.\n\nMadison explained that she fell into Zellmer's pool and that Zellmer rescued Madison,\n\npulling her out of the pool by her hair. Barnett's and Zellmer's relationship ended shortly\n\nthereafter.\n\n       The State also presented evidence that Zellmer changed his story about what\n\nhappened the night of Ashley's drowning several times. Zellmer initially reported that he\n\nput on a video tape downstairs for Ashley to watch then went upstairs to take a nap.\n\nAfter Dakota woke him up, he went looking for Ashley, found a cake box on the back\n\ndeck that had been opened, and discovered Ashley in the pool. But, in 2004, he told\n\nfour different acquaintances four different stories about what he was doing when Ashley\n\ndrowned.\n\n\n       In the spring, he told a childhood acquaintance that he was at home with Ashley\n\nand his son Levi, waiting for Dakota to get home. He fell asleep, and when he woke up\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/6\n\n\n\n\nhe couldn't find Ashley in the house. He eventually discovered that she had fallen into\n\nthe pool.\n\n       In the summer, Zellmer dated Levi's former history teacher. Zellmer told her that\n\non the night of Ashley's death, he instructed Ashley to go to her room to watch a video.\n\nMeanwhile, he went downstairs to build a fire. While he was building the fire, Dakota\n\ninformed him that the door to the backyard was open. He went into the backyard and\n\ndiscovered Ashley in the pool. Zellmer repeated that approximate version of events in\n\nsworn declarations he signed in August 2004 and January 2005.\n\n       Zellmer also renewed a friendship with a high school friend after they discovered\n\ntheir children played baseball together. When the topic of Ashley's death came up,\n\nZellmer said that he was downstairs doing laundry. He went upstairs to find her and\n\ndiscovered that she was in the pool.\n\n       At some point in 2004, Zellmer began dating a young bank teller, who had a one\n\nand a half year old child. During the course of their short-lived relationship, Zellmer\n\nsuggested that they get married and that she get life insurance for her child. Regarding\n\nAshley's death, Zellmer told her that he had been outside chopping wood, and his two\n\nsons were inside watching Ashley. He said that Ashley went into the backyard and fell\n\ninto the pool.\n\n       Each of Zellmer's versions of events, in which Ashley went to the pool on her\n\nown, conflicted with extensive testimony about Ashley's disposition. Ashley was afraid\n\nof the dark and refused to voluntarily enter dark rooms. She disliked the cold. She\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/7\n\n\n\n\ncould not swim, disliked bodies of water, and did not have any interest in going to the\n\npool. She clung to caregivers and never wandered off on her own.\n\n       The jury found Zellmer guilty of second degree murder, with an aggravating\n\nfactor due to Ashley's particular vulnerability. It did not reach a verdict as to first degree\n\nmurder.\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n       On appeal, Zellmer argues that reversal is warranted by a number of trial court\n\nerrors and improper acts by the State, both before and during trial.           First, Zellmer\n\nargues that during the course of investigation and prosecution, the State knowingly\n\nviolated his constitutional right to a confidential relationship with his attorney. Second,\n\nhe claims that the trial court erred in admitting three prior incidents in which children\n\nwere harmed while in Zellmer's care as evidence of a common plan or scheme under\n\nER 404(b). Third, Zellmer contends that the trial court violated his right to a public trial\n\nby excluding the teenage son of a witness from the courtroom during trial. Fourth,\n\nZellmer argues that the trial court erred in allowing an expert tracker to opine that\n\nAshley did not walk across the back deck based on his analysis of crime scene\n\nphotographs. He also argues that a second tracker's testimony about the opinion of a\n\nthird nontestifying tracker violated his right to confront witnesses against him. Fifth,\n\nZellmer argues the State committed prosecutorial misconduct by appealing to the jury's\n\nsympathy for Ashley's family during closing argument. Sixth, he claims that the trial\n\ncourt gave an erroneous unanimity instruction to the jury. Seventh, Zellmer asserts that\n\nthe court violated his constitutional right to be present by answering a question from the\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/8\n\n\n\ndeliberating jury in Zellmer's absence.     Eighth, he contends that cumulative error\n\nwarrants reversal of his conviction. And lastly, he argues that the trial court improperly\n\nunsealed documents involving his requests for expert funding and claims that his\n\nattorney-client privilege was violated.\n\n  I.   Right to Counsel\n\n       Zellmer argues that during the course of investigation and prosecution, the State\n\nknowingly and sometimes deliberately violated his constitutional right to a confidential\n\nrelationship with his counsel. Zellmer contends that the State intruded into his attorney-\n\nclient relationship in two ways.      First, he argues that the State used a jailhouse\n\ninformant, Kevin Olsen, to gather information about Zellmer regarding his trial\n\npreparation and strategy. Second, he argues that the State used search warrants and\n\nsubpoena authority to seize documents that contained privileged attorney-client\n\ncommunications. Zellmer contends that the State gained intangible benefits from these\n\nalleged violations. As such, he argues, prejudice must be presumed and the only\n\neffective remedy is dismissal.2\n       Zellmer moved to dismiss his charges because the State seized privileged\n\ndocuments from his home. A trial court's denial of a motion to dismiss is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion. State v.

But, Zellmer makes\nno other argument and cites no authority for this supplemental assignment of error, so\nwe need not consider it. RAP 10.3(a)(6).\n\n\n                                                8\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/9\n\n\n\n\ndiscretion when its decision is manifestly unreasonable or exercised on untenable\n\ngrounds or for untenable reasons.

As a result, the trial court did not\n\nhave an opportunity to consider whether dismissal was the appropriate remedy on the\n\njailhouse informant issue. See Salas v. Hi-Tech Erectors, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671 n.2, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2626022\"><a href=\"/opinion/2626022/salas-v-hi-tech-erectors/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010).

Intrusion into\n\nprivate attorney-client communications violates a defendant's right to effective\n\nrepresentation and due process. State v. Cory. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606756\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606756/state-v-cory/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374-75, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606756\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606756/state-v-cory/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1963).\n\n   A. Deliberate, Egregious Intrusion\n\n       Two themes arise in Washington cases addressing this issue. First, dismissal is\n\nwarranted      when    the    State's   intrusion   into   the   defendant's   attorney-client\n\ncommunications is both deliberate and egregious.            Second, the State's intrusion is\n\ndeliberate and egregious when the intercepted communications are those between the\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/10\n\n\n\n\ndefendant and his counsel in the case being tried. For instance, in Cory, the defendant\n\nmet with his attorney to discuss his case in a private jail room, where a sheriffs deputy\n\nhad secretly installed a microphone to eavesdrop on their conversations. Id. at 372.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court concluded that dismissal was the only appropriate\n\nremedy, because it was impossible to isolate the resulting prejudice. JcL at 377-78. The\n\nofficer's \"shocking and unpardonable\" conduct deprived Cory of his right to effective\n\ncounsel, vitiating the entire proceeding. ]p\\ at 378.\n\n       In Granacki, during trial recess, a detective read defense counsel's trial notes\n\nand engaged in a discussion with a sitting juror. 90 Wn. App. at 600. The trial court\n\ndeclared a mistrial. Id. at 601. After briefing, the trial court concluded the detective had\n\nintentionally read counsel's notes and that dismissal based on that conduct was\n\nwarranted,   id.   This court acknowledged that the intrusion into Granacki's right to\n\ncounsel was less egregious than the eavesdropping in Cory, but was nonetheless\n\nanalogous, so it was within the trial court's discretion to dismiss. Id at 603-04. Both the\n\nCory and Granacki courts found dismissal appropriate to discourage such deliberate\n\nand egregious intrusions into the defendant's attorney-client privilege. ]g\\\n\n       In Garza, prison guards seized inmates' personal property, including legal\n\ndocuments containing private communications with their attorneys. State v. Garza, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in dismissing the defendant's charges, because it was impossible to isolate\n\nany resulting prejudice.3 Jdat332.\n   B. Appropriate Remedy\n\n       When the State intrudes into the defendant's attorney-client relationship, the\n\nquestion remains what is the appropriate remedy.           Zellmer argues that the State's\n\nintrusion is a structural error, requiring a presumption of prejudice and automatic\n\ndismissal. This contention is not supported by controlling case law. Since Cory, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court rejected a per se rule that any government intrusion into\n\nprivate attorney-client communications establishes a Sixth Amendment violation of the\n\n\n       3 Zellmer also relies extensively on the Connecticut case State v.

Jailhouse Informant\n\n          Zellmer moved to exclude Olsen's testimony, arguing in part that the State used\n\nOlsen to deliberately elicit information about the charged crime, violating his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel under Massiah v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106822\"><a href=\"/opinion/106822/massiah-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205-06, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106822\"><a href=\"/opinion/106822/massiah-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1964). The trial court held an extensive pretrial hearing\n\non the motion and considered the following facts.        Olsen was a long-time jailhouse\n\nsnitch.     In November 2007, he contacted Detective Mike Ciesynski to volunteer\n\ninformation about four different cases, including Zellmer's. Both Ciesynski and Olsen\n\nthen contacted Detective Sue Peters, who was investigating Zellmer's case. But, there\n\nwas no evidence that Ciesynski encouraged Olsen to eavesdrop on Zellmer or offered\n\nany benefit to Olsen for the information on Zellmer. Peters acknowledged to Olsen that\n\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/14\n\n\n\n\nZellmer was a thorn in her side, but instructed Olsen not to solicit any other information\n\nfrom Zellmer. However, Peters met with Olsen in December 2008, and Olsen called her\n\na number of times afterward.       Detectives and prosecutors spoke with Olsen several\n\nmore times to take recorded statements about his conversations with Zellmer.         They\n\nalso did not separate Zellmer and Olsen, who were in the same tank together in jail.\n\n       The court found that the State did not deliberately solicit any disclosures from\n\nOlsen. As such, the court found that the detectives and prosecutors did not engage in\n\nany misconduct. But, the court explained that after Olsen's initial disclosure, the State\n\nrealized it \"had an ear into the defense\" and kept listening, when it should have stopped\n\nand separated Zellmer and Olsen. As a result, the court categorically excluded all\n\nevidence of subsequent disclosures Olsen made to the State after his initial contact with\n\nDetective Ciesynski. This remedy is similar to the one acknowledged in Granacki as\n\nlegitimately within the court's discretion.\n\n       Nevertheless, Zellmer contends that the State's '\"ear into the defense'\" was\n\nuseful in shaping its trial strategy. For instance, Olsen told detectives that Zellmer said\n\nhis anger got the best of him when he drowned Ashley. The State acknowledged that\n\nthis was the first and only time Zellmer admitted that Ashley did not get into the pool on\n\nher own.      But, the State argued at trial that Zellmer's murder of Ashley was\n\npremeditated based on his overarching plan to claim her life insurance proceeds—not\n\nthat his anger got the best of him. Other than baldly asserting that Olsen's information\n\nshaped trial strategy, Zellmer makes no showing that Olsen's disclosures led to\n\ndiscovery of other evidence or altered the State's trial strategy. Rather, the trial court\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/15\n\n\n\n\neffectively isolated any potential prejudice by excluding the evidence, without resorting\n\nto the drastic remedy of dismissal.\n\n       Moreover, in Cory, Granacki. Grath, and Perrow. a government agent intruded\n\ninto the defendant's attorney-client relationship.    Zellmer's case is distinguishable,\n\nbecause the trial court found that Olsen was not acting as a government agent. Zellmer\n\ndoes not challenge that finding. See State v. Hunter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 204, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">393</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). No government official asked Olsen to serve as an informant in Zellmer's\n\ncase and there was no agreement that he would do so. In fact, detectives told Olsen\n\nnot to spy on or engage with Zellmer, because it was illegal. The trial court explained:\n\n       There's nothing in this record to indicate that Detective Ciesynski or\n       anybody else put Mr. Olsen with Mr. Zellmer, was looking for Mr. Olsen to\n       gather any information from Mr. Zellmer, provided any explicit, implicit\n       offer of benefit to Mr. Olsen for providing information about Mr. Zellmer, or\n       otherwise engaged in improper behavior with regard to Mr. Olsen and Mr.\n       Zellmer.\n\nThe trial court even chastised defense counsel for making such accusations without a\n\nshred of evidentiary support. Because Olsen was not a government agent, there can be\n\nno government misconduct as a matter of law.4 See Benn, 134 Wn.2d at 912; Hunter.\n100 Wn. App. at 205.      In Hunter, we found similar fact—that no government officer\n\ndirected informant toward defendant or asked him to gather information on the\n\n\n\n\n       4 Though Zellmer does not challenge Olsen's agency, it is worth nothing that\ncourts have declined to find agency when \"'there was no evidence that the government\nhad directed or steered the informant toward the defendant.'\" Benn, 134 Wn.2d at 912\n(quoting United States v.

App. at 202, 205.\n\n        The trial court acted within its discretion by excluding all evidence of Olsen's\n\nconversations with the State about Zellmer. Exclusion isolated any potential prejudice.\n\nWe find no constitutional violation and no basis to dismiss on these grounds.\n\n   D. Seized Documents and Insurance Files\n\n\n        In December 2005, the State obtained a search warrant for Zellmer's residence.\n\nPolice officers executed the warrant and obtained large volumes of documents from the\n\nhome.      At the time of the search, the officers knew Zellmer was involved in judicial\n\nproceedings. In addition to divorce and custody disputes, Stacey had sued Zellmer for\n\nwrongful death. Accordingly, the officers at the scene took precautions to scan and\n\nsegregate privileged documents.        They did not review any arguably privileged\n\ndocuments. After the seizure, Zellmer's attorney advised the prosecution that the State\n\nhad seized privileged materials.5 The State permitted Zellmer's attorney to look through\nseized items and identify those that were either privileged or beyond the scope of the\n\nwarrant.     The court then appointed a special master to review items that Zellmer's\n\n\n        5 In August 2006, Zellmer filed a motion for the return of property. He argued\nthat there was no probable cause to support the search warrant, that the warrant lacked\nsufficient particularity, and that the seizures exceeded the scope of the warrant. At that\ntime, no criminal charges had been filed against Zellmer. The trial court largely denied\nthe motion. Zellmer filed a notice of appeal from that decision and submitted his first\nbrief on May 14, 2007. When Zellmer appealed following his murder conviction, the two\nappeals were consolidated for review. The remedy when evidence is improperly seized,\nhowever, is exclusion.     See, e.g.. State v. Riley. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367783\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367783/state-v-riley/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1367783\"><a href=\"/opinion/1367783/state-v-riley/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1993). Here, the State used at trial only one piece of evidence that was seized during\nthe search.      The existence and substance of that evidence was independently\nestablished by Stacey. Thus, there is no additional remedy available for the issues\nraised in Zellmer's first appeal, and we do not evaluate those arguments.\n\n\n                                               16\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/17\n\n\n\n\nattorney alleged contained privileged materials. The investigators never looked at the\n\nchallenged documents again.\n\n      Detectives discovered and read one brief document on Zellmer's computer called\n\n\"accident.doc\" that explained the drowning incident.    They noted that the version of\n\nevents in the document was different than other statements by Zellmer.          But, the\n\ndocument did not appear privileged on its face and did not contain any language that\n\nsuggested it was written for a lawyer.     Even so, the document was later deemed\n\nprivileged and excluded.\n\n      This search and seizure is quite distinguishable from the purposeful intrusion in\n\nPerrow where the detective knew documents were privileged when he analyzed them\n\nand sent them on to the prosecutor's office. 156 Wn. App. at 326. Instead, detectives\n\nhere took measures to isolate and avoid reviewing privileged materials. And, there is no\n\nevidence that they communicated the content of privileged documents to the\n\nprosecutor's office. Detectives did nothing analogous to eavesdropping on Zellmer's\n\nconversations with his attorney, reading defense counsel's trial notes, or searching\n\nZellmer's jail cell to discover confidential communications. Any State intrusion into\n\nZellmer's attorney-client privilege during the search and seizure of documents from\n\nZellmer's home was neither deliberate nor egregious.\n\n      Moreover, none of the information seized from Zellmer's home concerned his\n\nrelationship with his defense counsel, except the computer document that did not\n\nappear privileged on its face and was excluded at trial. Rather, the allegedly privileged\n\ndocuments were communications with attorneys related to prior divorces, custody\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/18\n\n\n\ndisputes, and the wrongful death lawsuit.        The trial court reasoned that having\n\nrelationships with attorneys, and having those documents in his home, did not shield\n\nZellmer from an otherwise lawful search.      To automatically dismiss a case on such\n\ngrounds would be absurd, because if a defendant had any prior relationship with an\n\nattorney, he could claim governmental intrusion into his attorney-client privilege in those\n\nother matters.     Such a   rule would hinder effective law enforcement and lead to\n\nunnecessary dismissals.6\n      The State also obtained an insurance file from Zellmer's homeowner insurance\n\ncarrier that concerned whether the insurer had an obligation to represent Zellmer in the\n\nwrongful death case. Zellmer told his insurance company a different version of events\n\nthan he was alleging in the criminal case.        The State believed the file had high\n\nevidentiary value and disputed Zellmer's position that the file was privileged. The court\n\nconcluded that the file, which apparently was not taken from Zellmer's home, was not\n\nobtained directly or indirectly by government intrusion. And, the file did not enhance the\n\nState's strategy, because Zellmer had already made admissible inconsistent statements\n\nabout what happened the night of Ashley's drowning.\n\n       The trial court effectively isolated any potential prejudice from the challenged\n\ndocuments.       Exercising an abundance of caution, the court deemed all disputed\n\nmaterials privileged and excluded them from trial, including the insurance file. And, the\n\ncourt concluded that the State did not gain any benefit from seeing the brief\n\n\n       6 Indeed, the dissent in Perrow explained that a \"shrewd defense attorney, in\neither a civil or criminal case, would be wise to 'inadvertently' send a privileged\ndocument to the plaintiffs counsel and then seek dismissal of the pending civil or\ncriminal case.\" 156 Wn. App at 340 (Korsmo, A.C.J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                                18\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/19\n\n\n\n\n\"accident.doc\" or the insurance file, because the State already had other evidence of\n\nZellmer's inconsistent version of events. This is the proper analysis under Weatherford.\n\nSimply because the State saw potentially privileged materials does not require a\n\npresumption of prejudice and dismissal. See State v. Webbe. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Therefore, the court acted well within its\n\ndiscretion by excluding any allegedly privileged material from trial, but denying dismissal\n\nof the case because Zellmer showed no prejudice.\n\n II.   ER 404(b) Evidence\n\n       After an extensive pretrial hearing, the trial court allowed the State to introduce\n\nevidence of three prior incidents in which children were harmed while in Zellmer's care.\n\nThe court admitted the incidents under ER 404(b) as evidence of Zellmer's overarching\n\nplan to orchestrate a child's death in order to collect insurance proceeds. Zellmer\n\nargues that the trial court erred in admitting this evidence, because the incidents were\n\naccidents and therefore could not be part of a purposeful plan.

Mitchell Komendant\n\n\n      The first incident admitted involved four month old Mitchell Komendant, whose\n\nlegs were suspiciously fractured while in Zellmer's care.      Zellmer added uninsured\n\nmotorist coverage to the couple's automobile insurance shortly after he and Stacey\n\nKomendant were married in 1990. Zellmer then claimed Mitchell was injured in a car\n\naccident, filed an accident report, and attempted to collect from the insurer. But, he\n\nlater admitted to Mitchell's mother that there was no accident. The State argued this\n\nwas the beginning of Zellmer's overarching plan to marry single mothers and injure their\n\nyoung children in order to profit from insurance claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/21\n\n\n\n          Zellmer claims that there is no evidence as to what caused Mitchell's injuries.\n\nAnd, he argues that the incident is not markedly similar to the other incidents, because\n\nthe financial motive to collect insurance only arose after Mitchell was injured. These\n\narguments are not supported by the record. The court found by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that Zellmer was clearly the agent of Mitchell's injuries.       This is readily\n\napparent, because the injury occurred while the child was in Zellmer's care and he\n\nfabricated the accident.     And, the incident is markedly similar to Ashley's drowning,\n\nbecause Zellmer married a single mother with a young child, orchestrated an injury to\n\nhis step-child left in his care, then attempted to collect insurance proceeds from the\n\ninjury.\n\n          The court concluded that the common plan or scheme was \"a fairly obvious one\n\nhere of fabricating injury to property, to Mr. Zellmer himself, and to very young children\n\nwho were not biologically Mr. Zellmer's, only legally his.\" The court found that the\n\nevidence was relevant as one of the incidents in Zellmer's overarching plan, \"extremely\n\nrelevant\" to the State's claim of premeditation, and relevant to show Zellmer's\n\nknowledge of how to make insurance claims.             The court acknowledged that the\n\nevidence was prejudicial, but not unfairly so within the meaning of ER 404(b). The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n    B. Kyle Clauson\n\n          The second incident admitted involved Kyle Clauson, who was less than a year\n\nold and still in the crawling stage of his development when he nearly drowned in a hot\n\ntub while in Zellmer's care. The child would have had to climb several steps to enter the\n\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/22\n\n\n\n\nhot tub, and the hot tub was normally covered by a heavy lid. The State argued that this\n\nincident was an uncompleted manifestation of Zellmer's plan to murder a child by\n\nmaking it appear that the child accidentally fell into a body of water.        The State\n\nmaintained that Zellmer used this incident to test how a single mother would react and\n\nto see if she accepted his explanation.\n\n      Zellmer argues that the court found no evidence that he intentionally injured Kyle.\n\nThis argument is unsupported by the record. The court stated that it admitted the\n\nevidence in part for the purpose of showing lack of accident. The facts of the incident\n\nsupport that decision.   Zellmer also argues that this event is distinguishable from\n\nAshley's drowning, because he had no potential insurance gain and there was no actual\n\ninjury to Kyle. It is true that Zellmer and Clauson were not married and that Zellmer did\n\nnot have a life insurance policy taken out on Kyle. But, other aspects of the incident are\n\nstrikingly similar to Ashley's death. Zellmer was left alone with a single mother's young\n\nchild and the child somehow fell in a body of water, even though the child's\n\ndevelopmental characteristics made it highly unlikely that he would have crawled into\n\nthe hot tub by himself. Zellmer then had the opportunity to gauge the mother's reaction\n\nto his explanation that it was an accident.      Characterization of the incident as an\n\nuncompleted manifestation of Zellmer's alleged overarching scheme is not inconsistent\n\nwith our case law. And, as such, uncompleted or individual manifestations of an\n\noverarching plan may be admitted as ER 404(b) evidence. DeVincentis, 150 Wn.2d at\n\n19-21: Roth. 75 Wn. App. at 822 n.8.\n\n\n\n\n                                               22\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/23\n\n\n\n      The court acknowledged that the evidence was prejudicial. But, the court found\n\nthat this evidence had \"extreme probative value,\" because it was good evidence of\n\nZellmer's overarching plan or preparation to move quickly into a relationship with a\n\nsingle mother, injure her young child in what appeared to be an accidental way, then\n\n\"see if he was essentially able to sell it.\"   On balance, the probative value of this\n\nevidence outweighed the resulting prejudice. The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin admitting this evidence.\n\n   C. Madison Barnett\n\n       The third incident admitted involved four year old Madison Barnett, who fell in\n\nZellmer's pool in December 2002, a year before Ashley's drowning. Zellmer proposed\n\nto a single mother with a young daughter after a brief whirlwind romance. Zellmer soon\n\nbroached the subject of life insurance with her. Then, Zellmer seized the opportunity to\n\ngauge her response to her daughter accidentally falling in Zellmer's pool. This fits\nwithin Zellmer's larger scheme of testing mothers' responses to their children\n\naccidentally falling in bodies of water. The court also thought it \"interesting that Mr.\nZellmer and the child are out in December near the pool considering the overarching\n\nscheme and plan the State says reached its fruition with Ashley's murder.\"\n\n       The court found that this incident was an accident, because Madison admitted\n\nshe was reaching for goggles that were in the pool and fell in. As a result, the court did\nnot consider the incident to be \"all that prejudicial, because nobody's arguing that it\n\nwasn't an accident.\" But, the court believed the evidence was probative and admissible,\n\nbecause it had many of the same features as Ashley's drowning.            And, the court\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/24\n\n\n\n\nproperly limited both the prejudice and probative value by not allowing the State to\n\nargue that this evidence showed lack of accident. The court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin admitting this evidence as an uncompleted manifestation of Zellmer's overarching\n\nplan.\n\n III.   Exclusion of a Spectator from Trial\n\n        Zellmer argues that the trial court violated his right to a public trial and the\n\npublic's right to access court proceedings by excluding the fifteen year old son of a\n\nwitness from the courtroom during trial.         The United States and Washington\n\nConstitutions guarantee a defendant's right to a public trial. U.S. Const, amend. VI;\n\nConst, art. I, § 22. And, justice in all cases must be administered openly, granting the\n\npublic an interest in open, accessible proceedings. Const, art. I, § 10; Seattle Times\n\nCo. v. Ishikawa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194165\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194165/seattle-times-co-v-ishikawa/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194165\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194165/seattle-times-co-v-ishikawa/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982).         To determine whether a\n\ncourtroom closure is appropriate, courts must consider five factors and enter specific\n\nfindings on the record to justify the closure. State v. Lormor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2454575\"><a href=\"/opinion/2454575/state-v-lormor/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 n.1,257\n\nP.3d 624 (2011).\n\n        The Washington Supreme Court recently held in Lormor that exclusion of one\n\nperson does not constitute a courtroom closure and therefore does not implicate the\n\ndefendant's public trial right. Jd. at 87. Rather, a closure occurs when the courtroom is\n\ncompletely and purposefully closed to spectators so no one may enter or leave. Jd at\n\n93. Consequently, a trial court's decision to exclude one spectator is a matter of\n\ncourtroom operations, reviewed for abuse of discretion. Jd at 94. The Lormor court\n\nlikened this broad discretion to the trial court's power under ER 615 to exclude\n\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/25\n\n\n\n\nwitnesses so they cannot hear testimony of other witnesses. Jd at 94. But, the trial\n\ncourt must still exercise caution in removing a spectator and articulate its reasons for\n\ndoing so on the record.       Jd   However, Zellmer is incorrect that exclusion of one\n\nspectator requires the five factor analysis and specific findings for a true courtroom\n\nclosure. See id at 94-95.\n\n       Here, the trial court excluded a teenager whose father, Joe Wickersham, was\n\nscheduled to testify later that day. Zellmer argues that the teenager was excluded\n\nbecause he was a minor. But, he mischaracterizes the record. Before the court knew\n\nthe boy was a witness's son, it said, \"It's fine. It's fine to have an escorted child here.\n\nIt's Dad's decision whether to bring a child to this case. I wouldn't, but it's his call.\" But,\n\nthe court had already excluded witnesses from the courtroom under ER 615, including\n\nWickersham, the boy's father. The court excluded the teenager specifically because it\n\nwas \"not confident\" that he would not repeat to his father what was going on in court,\n\nwhich would interfere with the ER 615 order.\n\n       It was well within the trial court's discretion to exclude the boy to protect its ER\n\n615 ruling and prevent him from passing information on to his father. This helped\n\npreserve the integrity of court proceedings and was sufficient to support the boy's\n\nexclusion. And, the court properly articulated its reason for removal on the record, as\n\nrequired by Lormor. There is no evidence that the court excluded the boy because he\n\nwas a minor, so we need not consider whether that would be within the court's\n\ndiscretion. There is no error.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/26\n\n\n\nIV.      Expert Tracker Testimony\n\n        Zellmer argues that the trial court improperly admitted expert testimony from two\n\ndifferent trackers.\n\n\n      A. Testimony About Crime Scene Photographs\n\n         Zellmer argues that expert tracker Joel Hardin should not have been allowed to\n\ntestify about his analysis of crime scene photographs taken by police investigators on\n\nthe night of Ashley's drowning. Zellmer contends that Hardin's experience is with live,\n\nin-person tracking, not analyzing photographs. Zellmer therefore argues that Hardin's\n\ntestimony was not based on reliable science, exceeded Hardin's expertise, and was not\n\nhelpful to the jury.\n\n         At trial, Zellmer objected to Hardin's opinion that Ashley did not walk across the\n\nback deck and moved for a mistrial, which the trial court denied. We review both a trial\n\ncourt's decision to admit expert testimony and to deny a motion for a mistrial for abuse\n\nof discretion.    State v. Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399269\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399269/state-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399269\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399269/state-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992); State v.\n\nHopson, 113Wn.2d273, 284, 778 P.2d 1014(1989). Expert testimony will be admitted\n\nwhen (1) the witness qualifies as an expert, (2) the opinion is based on a theory\n\ngenerally accepted in the relevant scientific community, and (3) the testimony is helpful\n\nto the trier of fact. State v. Cheatam. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623480/state-v-cheatam/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003).\n\n         We have previously rejected the same argument Zellmer makes here involving\n\nthe same tracker who testified at Zellmer's trial. State v. Groth. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2341194\"><a href=\"/opinion/2341194/state-v-groth/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011). In Groth, Hardin analyzed decades old crime scene photographs\n\nto determine whether any evidence showed that Groth's Vibram brand shoes were at\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/27\n\n\n\n\nthe scene. Jd. at 555-56. Hardin testified that there were two sets of footprints in the\n\nphotographs—one matching the victim's shoes and the other matching Groth's shoes.\n\nJd at 556.    We concluded that Hardin's training and experience allowed him to\n\nformulate conclusions solely from the photographs. Jd at 563-64.\n\n       The facts and circumstances of Zellmer's case are almost identical to Groth.7\n\nInvestigators gave Hardin Ashley's shoes and photographs from the scene years after\n\nthe drowning. They asked Hardin to determine if there was any evidence that Ashley\n\nstepped in cake frosting then walked across the deck and down the stairs to the pool.\n\nHardin testified that he found remnants of cake frosting in the sole of Ashley's shoe.\n\nBut, he found no evidence of frosting tracked from Ashley's shoe on the deck or down\n\nthe stairs.\n\n\n       Examining photographs for evidence of Ashley's shoeprints is well within\n\nHardin's expertise.    Hardin has 40 years of experience examining footprint evidence.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court recognizes his tracking expertise. Ortiz, 119 Wn.2d at\n\n310 (holding that Hardin was qualified as expert based on his extensive training and\n\nthousands of hours of experience). And, Hardin's testimony was helpful to the jury,\n\nbecause his can recognize and interpret signs that a lay person would overlook. Groth,\n\n163 Wn. App. at 564.\n\n       Lastly, Hardin's analysis of photographs does not preclude his testimony. Jd at\n\n563-64. Rather, it goes to the weight the jury gives it. Ortiz, 119 Wn.2d at 311. Just\n\n\n\n\n       7 The only difference appears to be that in Groth, Hardin analyzed whether the\nsole matched specific footprints, while in Zellmer's case, he analyzed whether any\nfootprints could be identified as originating from the sole.\n\n\n                                              27\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/28\n\n\n\n\nlike in Groth, Hardin was subjected to searching cross-examination. Defense counsel\n\npointed out the shortcomings of Hardin analyzing photographs, as opposed to real-time\n\ntracking.   A defense expert contradicted Hardin's conclusions.        Tracking is not so\n\ntechnical a discipline that the jurors could not draw independent conclusions about the\n\nreliability of Hardin's testimony. Ortiz. 119 Wn.2d at 311. The trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in admitting Hardin's expert testimony or denying Zellmer's subsequent\n\nmotion for a mistrial on that basis.\n\n   B. Confrontation Clause\n\n\n       Zellmer argues that a second tracker's testimony violated his right to confront\n\nwitnesses against him. Kathleen Decker testified as an expert tracker in the State's\n\nrebuttal case. Decker explained that she, Hardin, and a third tracker, Sharon Ward,\n\nworked on a team to analyze crime scene photographs. Decker testified that \"we were\n\nin agreement and still are in agreement to our opinion\" that Ashley did not walk across\n\nthe deck.   She continued, \"We were not able to see any sign made from [Ashley's]\n\nsandal.\"    Zellmer argues that Decker's use of the word \"we\" constitutes opinion\n\ntestimony from a witness who did not testify at trial, violating the confrontation clause of\n\nthe Sixth Amendment and article I, section 22 of the Washington Constitution.\n\nHowever, defense counsel failed to object to Decker's testimony.8 Therefore, Zellmer\nhas waived the issue absent manifest constitutional error.        RAP 2.5(a)(3).    Even a\n\nmanifest constitutional error may be subject to harmless error analysis. Kirkman. 159\n\n\n       8 Zellmer claims that he did object, citing the previous day's transcript. But,\ndefense counsel only objected to the cumulative nature of Decker's testimony, not that\nshe would be testifying about the opinion of a third non-testifying tracker, in violation of\nthe confrontation clause.\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/29\n\n\n\nWn.2d at 927.      A constitutional error is harmless if we are convinced beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that any reasonable jury would have reached the same result absent\n\nthe error. State v. Gulov, 104Wn.2d412, 425, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116120/state-v-guloy/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985)\n\n      Here, Decker's \"we\" testimony was harmless.        The jury already heard similar\n\ntestimony from Hardin. And, Zellmer's defense expert mounted a compelling rebuttal\n\nundermining Hardin's conclusions that were the same as Decker's. Moreover, Decker's\n\n\"we\" testimony was exceptionally limited in light of Zellmer's entire six week trial. And,\n\nshe mentioned Ward only once. Decker's testimony is also readily distinguishable from\n\nBullcominq v. New Mexico. _U.S._, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219509\"><a href=\"/opinion/219509/bullcoming-v-new-mexico/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2709, 180 L Ed. 2d 610 (2011).\n\nThere, the State's principal evidence was a forensic lab report certifying Bullcoming's\n\nhigh blood alcohol concentration. Jd Instead of calling the certifying analyst, though,\n\nthe State called another analyst who was familiar with the lab's testing procedures, but\n\nhad neither participated in nor observed the blood sample test. Jd. The Court held that\n\nthis \"surrogate testimony\" violated Bullcoming's right to confront witnesses against him.\nJd at 2710. In contrast, Decker was not a surrogate analyst—she actively participated\n\nin the tracking analysis. She testified about her own conclusions, which corresponded\nto the team's conclusions. And, her testimony was not the State's principal evidence\n\nagainst Zellmer. Therefore, we hold that any error resulting from Decker's testimony\n\nwas harmless.\n\n\n V.    Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n       Zellmer argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury's sympathy\n\nfor the victim's family in his closing argument. He contends that these arguments were\n\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/30\n\n\n\noutside the evidence and served no valid purpose except to arouse the jury's sympathy\n\nfor the family and hostility toward him. Prosecutorial misconduct requires a showing\n\nthat the prosecutor's conduct was both improper and prejudicial. State v. Monday. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 675, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2452000\"><a href=\"/opinion/2452000/state-v-monday/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011).

But, in closing argument, the prosecutor has wide latitude in\n\nmaking arguments to the jury and drawing reasonable inferences from admitted\n\nevidence. Anderson, 153 Wn. App. at 427-28.

The first\n\nare toward the beginning of the prosecutor's closing. The prosecutor told the jury that\n\nhe was not going to replay videos of Ashley taken by her father shortly before she was\n\nkilled, \"because members of little Ashley's family, are present.\" And, the prosecutor told\n\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/31\n\n\n\n\nthe jury he would not show them the photos of Ashley's autopsy again, because \"I'm\n\nsure you can imagine how much pain Ashley's family has been through and we don't\n\nneed to put them through any more.\"           Defense counsel did not object to these\n\nstatements. Zellmer makes no argument as to why these statements were flagrant and\n\nill-intentioned, instead addressing the cumulative effect of the prosecutor's statements.\n\n       The second group of statements came at the end of the prosecutor's closing\n\nargument, after 30 pages of argument in the record. The prosecutor recognized that\n\nZeller is \"entitled to his day in court and he's gotten it.\" But, \"[h]e's not the only person\n\ndeserving of something here.\" The prosecutor then made the following argument, to\n\nwhich Zellmer assigns error:\n\n              If Ashley McLellan had survived her exposure to the defendant, she\n       would have celebrated her tenth birthday just six days ago.\n\n              If the defendant hadn't taken her life from her, she'd probably be in\n       fourth grade and like any other fourth grader, she'd be putting the last of\n       her baby teeth under the pillow for the tooth fairy, maybe starting to read\n       longer books without as many pictures.\n\nThe trial court overruled defense counsel's objection to this line of argument.          The\n\nprosecutor continued, describing Ashley playing with her little sister or asking her\n\nparents for a cell phone.       Defense counsel again objected and the court again\n\noverruled.\n\n\n       The prosecutor went on to say:\n\n            Stacey would be standing on the sidelines during Ashley's soccer\n       games, tucking her into bed at night, probably turning a night light on on\n       the way out of the room.\n\n             Her dad, Bruce, like any other father, probably would be watching\n       Ashley like any other ten-year-old girl dancing around the room with her\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/32\n\n\n      friends to whatever ridiculous Hannah Montana song was big at the\n      moment.\n\n\n              Instead, Stacey and Bruce live with broken hearts for the rest of\n      their lives knowing their daughter was murdered.\n\nDefense counsel objected that this was a claim of compassion. The court noted the\n\nobjection and overruled.\n\n      The prosecutor reiterated that \"Stacey and Bruce deserve something now too.\"\n\nHe continued with a hypothetical of Ashley's grandparents looking at a photo of their\n\ngranddaughter's latest artwork on their refrigerator. He said that Ashley's grandparents\n\nare \"entitled to something now too.\" Then he finished:\n\n             All of those people and many others you heard in the courtroom\n      have had one of the precious things in their life, maybe the most precious\n      thing in their life, taken from them by the defendant.\n\n\n\n             Her parents are [sic], her grandparents, her aunts and uncles, all\n      the people who loved her, the people of the State of Washington.\n\n\n\n              All those people deserve one thing, they deserve justice. They're\n      entitled to a guilty verdict.\n\nDefense counsel renewed his objection in the middle of these final remarks, but it was\n\nagain overruled.\n\n      Immediately after the prosecutor's argument, the trial court instructed the jury:\n\n      I'm going to remind you yet again of something that we've been telling you\n      from the beginning of the case, that is that the purpose of the trial is to\n      assess whether the State has or has not proved the elements of the\n      charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n             And that's your objective with that assessment.\n\nThe court then dismissed the jury for recess before the defense's closing argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/33\n\n\n\n       Before the jury was brought back in from recess, defense counsel renewed his\n\nobjections to the prosecutor's closing remarks. He asked the court to instruct the jury\n\nthat they should not base their decision on appeals to passion or prejudice. The court\n\nreminded defense counsel of its limiting instruction to the jury before recess. And, the\n\ncourt explained, that instruction was one \"they have gotten very clearly from the first\n\nmoment they've come into my courtroom that's been repeated for them many times and\n\nI'm clear that they understand it.\" But, the court suggested that defense counsel remind\n\nthe jury of the instruction that \"they may not let their emotions overcome their rational\n\nthought process and have to reach their decision based on the law given to them not on\n\nsympathy, prejudice, or personal preference.\"        Defense counsel did so shortly after\n\nbeginning his closing argument.\n\n      A trial court's decision on prosecutorial misconduct is given deference on appeal.\n\nState v. Luvene, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 701, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2607237\"><a href=\"/opinion/2607237/state-v-luvene/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). This is because the trial\n\ncourt is in the best position to most effectively determine if prosecutorial misconduct\n\nprejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial. Id Here, the trial court believed that the\n\nprosecutor's comments were not an appeal to the jury's passion or prejudice.\n\nMoreover, the first jury instruction, given right before the State's closing argument,\n\nstated, \"It is your duty to decide the facts in this case based upon the evidence\n\npresented to you during this trial.\" That same instruction also said, \"You must not let\n\nyour emotions overcome your rational thought process. You must reach your decision\n\nbased on the facts proved to you and on the law given to you, not on sympathy,\n\nprejudice, or personal preference.\" Immediately after the prosecutor's closing, the court\n\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/34\n\n\n\nreminded the jury of the State's burden of proof in an \"excess of caution.\" The court\n\nalso explained that this instruction was reiterated to the jury throughout trial, so the court\n\nwas certain \"that they understand it.\" We presume that the jury was able to follow the\n\ncourt's instruction. Warren, 165 Wn.2d at 28.\n\n       Examining the prosecutor's comments in the full context of the trial, Zellmer has\n\nfailed to demonstrate that there is a substantial likelihood that they prejudiced the\n\noutcome of his trial.9 The prosecutor spoke for 30 pages about all the evidence against\nZellmer, including how unlikely it was that Ashley would have ventured out in the dark\n\nby herself. The prosecutor reminded the jury of prior incidents involving children\n\nsuspiciously injured in Zellmer's care. And, the prosecutor pointed out inconsistencies\n\nin Zellmer's version of events the night of the incident. The comments about the victim\n\nand her survivors' losses were not flagrant and ill-intentioned as to warrant a new trial.\n\nVI.    Unanimous Special Verdict Instruction\n\n       Zellmer argues that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it must be\n\nunanimous to answer \"no\" on the special verdict form supporting an aggravated\n\nsentence, in violation of State v. Bashaw, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2511634\"><a href=\"/opinion/2511634/state-v-bashaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010),\n\n      9 The cases that Zellmer cites to the contrary do not control here.

Nunez, 174 Wn.2d at 710. There is no error.\n\nVII.   Question from Deliberating Jury\n\n       Zellmer argues that the court improperly answered a question from the\n\ndeliberating jury without apprising him and without an in-court discussion, thereby\n\nviolating his constitutional right to be present. A criminal defendant has a fundamental\n\nright to be present at all critical stages of a trial. State v. Irbv, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 880, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011). The right exists whenever the defendant's presence has a reasonably\n\nsubstantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge. Jd at\n\n881. The right only exists to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by\n\nthe defendant's absence. Jd Thus, there is no right to be present when the defendant's\n\n\"'presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow.'\" Jd.

The court then responded in\n\nwriting, \"In this case, manslaughter in the first degree is not a lesser included offense\n\nthat you can consider.\" Whether manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder is\n\na pure legal issue.     Because the trial court consulted with defense counsel, it was\n\npermitted to respond to the jury's legal question without Zellmer being present. Any\n\nbenefit of Zellmer being at this purely legal discussion is not apparent. There was no\n\nviolation of Zellmer's constitutional right to be present.\n\nVIII.   Cumulative Error\n\n        Zellmer contends that cumulative error affected the outcome of his case. Where\n\nseveral errors standing alone do not warrant reversal, the cumulative error doctrine\n\n requires reversal when the combined effects of the errors denied the defendant a fair\n\ntrial. State v. Coe. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1434237\"><a href=\"/opinion/1434237/state-v-coe/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 789, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1434237\"><a href=\"/opinion/1434237/state-v-coe/\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). The only error here was\n\n allowing Kathleen Decker to testify briefly about a third non-testifying tracker's opinion.\n\n That error was harmless. The cumulative error doctrine does not apply here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/37\n\n\n\nIX.     Unsealed Documents\n\n\n        Zellmer argues that the trial court improperly unsealed documents involving his\n\nrequests for expert funding and claims that his attorney-client privilege was violated. He\n\nasserts that the trial court applied the incorrect legal test for determining whether to\n\nunseal the documents. The State concedes that when the trial court initially considered\n\nthe request to unseal records in December 2010, it applied the multi-factor Ishikawa\n\ntest.   But, the court stayed the unsealing so that defense counsel could review the\n\nrecords and make specific redaction requests.         In January 2011, the Washington\n\nSupreme Court held that unsealing such records should be determined with reference\n\nto GR 15(e) rather than the Ishikawa test. Yakima County v. Yakima Herald-Republic,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802-03, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2376601\"><a href=\"/opinion/2376601/yakima-v-yakima-herald-republic/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011). In light of this new law, Zellmer moved\n\nfor reconsideration of the trial court's unsealing order. On March 16, 2011, the court\n\ndenied Zellmer's motion, finding that unsealing was warranted under GR 15(e).\n\n        In a supplemental assignment of error, Zellmer argues that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for reconsideration, because it did not explain how the State met the\n\nGR 15(e) requirements and did not hold an in-court hearing. GR 15(e)(2) provides that\n\na \"sealed court record in a criminal case shall be ordered unsealed only upon proof of\n\ncompelling circumstances.\" Zellmer argues that the trial court's order stating only that\n\n\"in the Court's view, the requirements of GR 15 have been met\" is insufficient proof of\n\ncompelling circumstances. Zellmer asks this court to remand the case for a hearing on\n\nthe issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\fNo. 59228-9-1/38\n\n\n\n\n      However, GR 15(e) nowhere requires the court to hold a hearing to find proof of\n\ncompelling circumstances. And, Zellmer cites no other statutory authority or case law\n\nthat requires a court to do so. RAP 10.3(a)(6); State v. McNeair, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1224048\"><a href=\"/opinion/1224048/state-v-mcneair/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997) (failure to cite authority constitutes a concession that the\n\nargument lacks merit). Moreover, the trial court stated in the order that it found the GR\n\n15 requirements met based on its consideration of the defense motion and the State's\n\nresponse. The State discussed the compelling circumstances for unsealing at length in\n\nits response.   Clearly the trial court found this to be sufficient proof of compelling\n\ncircumstances. No hearing was required.\n\n      Zellmer also argues that State v. McEnroe entitles him to an opportunity to\n\nwithdraw the previously sealed documents containing privileged materials. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">795</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012). But, Zellmer's reliance on McEnroe is misplaced. The\n\nMcEnroe court held that only documents submitted with a motion to seal may be\n\nwithdrawn if the motion is denied. Jd at 798. McEnroe does mean that a defendant has\n\nthe right to withdraw documents filed under seal if the State later seeks to unseal those\n\ndocuments, as is the case here. There is no error.\n\n      We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              -PC-\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n   s^Ya^j                                            ^•^1\n\n\n                                               38\n\f</pre>",
