The court also made the husband\nresponsible for 60% of the mortgage obligation on the marital home and allowed the wife to\nretain her entire 401(k) retirement account. The husband contends on appeal that the division\nof property and debt was inequitable and that the trial court impermissibly awarded the wife\nher 401(k) account in the form of alimony in solido. We affirm the division of marital\nproperty and marital debt. We also find that there was no alimony award, because the final\norder in this case, signed by the judge, treats the 401(k) as part of the division of marital\nproperty rather than as alimony. However, it appears to us that the trial court made some\ncalculating errors when it ordered the husband to pay specific monthly amounts on the home\nmortgage. We therefore vacate that portion of the court’s order and remand this case to the\ntrial court so that it may correct those calculations.\n\n\n  Tenn. R.

D INKINS, JJ., joined.\n\nPatti Jon Burton Garner, Gallatin, Tennessee, for the appellant, William L. Downing.\n\nGary Michael Williams, Hendersonville, Tennessee, for the appellee, Sherrie J. Downing.\n\f                                        OPINION\n\n                          I. A M ARRIAGE OF L ONG D URATION\n\n       William J. Downing (“Husband”) and Sherrie J. Downing (“Wife”) married in 1983.\nThe two children who were born of their marriage were aged 18 and 14 at the time of the\nparties’s divorce. Wife worked during the entirety of the marriage at Lifeway Christian\nResources (formerly the Baptist Sunday School Board) in Nashville. Husband also worked\nsteadily during the marriage, mostly at jobs involving automotive sales. In 2000, he began\noperating his own automobile repair business out of the garage behind the marital home, and\nhe continued in that business up to and including the time of divorce.\n\n       In December of 2008, Husband announced to Wife that he was unhappy and that he\nno longer loved her. Shortly thereafter, he moved out of the marital home. On January 2,\n2009, he filed a complaint for divorce in the General Sessions Court of Sumner County,\nalleging that there were irreconcilable differences between the parties. See Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-4-129. He also stated that both parties were fit and proper parents, but he did not ask\nfor custody of the children.\n\n        On March 25, 2009, Wife filed a motion for pendente lite support. On the same day,\nshe filed a motion for exclusive possession of the marital home. Wife alleged that after\nleaving the marital home and moving in with his father, Husband had stopped making\npayments on the parties’ extensive credit card bills and that he had only contributed $245\ntowards the care of the children since his departure. Wife accordingly asked the court to\norder Husband “to contribute to the marital bills and expenses and provide sufficient support\nfor her and the children in at least the amount that he has always paid monthly during the\nmarriage, pending further orders of this Honorable Court.” There is no indication in the\ntechnical record that a hearing was ever conducted on Wife’s motion.\n\n       Husband subsequently amended his complaint to allege inappropriate marital conduct\non the part of Wife as an additional ground for divorce. Wife filed an answer and counter\ncomplaint for divorce on June 24, 2009. She admitted that there were irreconcilable\ndifferences between the parties, denied that she was guilty of any inappropriate conduct, and\nsuggested that Husband was himself guilty of inappropriate marital conduct. She asked for\nan equitable division of marital property and for custody of the children. Her counter\ncomplaint did not include a request for alimony, an omission that is the basis of one of\nHusband’s arguments on appeal. Shortly thereafter, Wife and her attorney parted ways, and\nshe retained new counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f       On September 2, 2009, Wife filed a motion to amend her counter complaint. She\nmentioned her earlier request for pendente lite support, stated that her prior counsel had\ninadvertently left the request for alimony out of her counter complaint, and declared that\n“there is a need for alimony in this matter.” In a trial memorandum, filed on October 1,\n2009, Wife repeated her request for alimony, and asked the court to award her $1,000 per\nmonth. There is no order in the technical record that indicates a ruling on Wife’s motion to\namend.\n\n                                II. T HE D IVORCE H EARING\n\n        The final divorce hearing was conducted on October 2, 2009. Aside from the parties,\nthe only witnesses to testify were a professional appraiser and a private investigator who\nWife had hired to find evidence of infidelity against Husband. Despite the lack of an order\nin the technical record regarding Mother’s motion to amend her counter complaint to request\nalimony, Husband’s attorney acknowledged during his opening argument that the trial court\nhad granted her motion.\n\n        The testimony of the parties mostly involved financial matters. Their joint income tax\nreturns from 2005 to 2008 were entered into the record, and showed that both parties earned\nfairly reliable incomes. In response to an interrogatory, Wife stated that her annual income\nwas $37,659. However, her 2008 W-2 form from Lifeway showed Social Security income\nof $31,202, and she suggested that the higher figure was a mistake. Husband’s Profit or Loss\nStatement from the same year showed gross receipts of $109,595. The “cost of goods sold”\n(presumably auto parts and supplies) was listed at $49,852, leaving gross income of $59,743.\nHe reported additional expenses of $24,044, resulting in a profit of $35,699.\n\n       There was no evidence that the parties, despite their income, had saved any money.\nThere was no discussion during trial of any savings accounts, certificates of deposit, or of any\ninvestments, other than those in wife’s 401(k) retirement account. The evidence showed that\nthe parties spent everything they earned, and then some. Wife testified that all her spending\nwas for the benefit of the children, and that she would not skimp on them so long as Husband\ncontinued to “throw money out the window” by drag racing.\n\n        Husband acknowledged that he has participated in drag racing for a long time, owning\ncars and racing them on a weekly basis. Referring to the costs, he stated that “you spend a\nlot of money real quick if you don’t watch it.” He testified that aside from maintenance and\nfuel costs, there is usually a $50 entry fee to race. There are also prizes for winners, usually\n$1,300 but sometimes quite a bit more: $5,000, $10,000, or even $100,000. Husband races\nfor pleasure, but he chooses to treat drag racing as a business for tax purposes. Although he\nwins some races, his tax records and his testimony show average losses of about $9,000\n\n                                              -3-\n\fannually.\n\n      It was undisputed that Husband took over the family’s finances in 1998, that he was\nresponsible for paying the bills, and that Wife trusted his judgment on financial matters. But\nHusband testified, “I am behind on a lot of bills.” The proof showed that the parties had\naccumulated a significant amount of credit card debt by the time of the divorce hearing.\n\n        Husband testified that a SunTrust card in his name was used for his business and also\nfor car expenses, including vehicles belonging to his wife and daughter. That card had a\nbalance of $10,178. He also testified to a $13,839 balance on a GreenBank credit card that\nhe used solely for business expenses. Husband also had a Chase credit card with a balance\nof $9,630 that Wife did not know about, but that Husband insisted he used “to support the\nlifestyle of my family.” However, other than that one statement during his testimony, he did\nnot present any evidence that he used that card for family purposes. Wife also had her own\nMNBA credit card, which she testified she used for vacations and for the children’s needs.\nShe also had a Kohl’s Department Store card. The balance on the MNBA card was about\n$8,000, and the balance on the Kohl’s card was about $800.\n\n       Husband had also obtained a line of credit for business purposes from Chase Home\nFinance that was secured by a second mortgage on the marital home. Although the line of\ncredit was in Husband’s name only, he testified that Wife used it on several occasions\nwithout his permission by signing his name on line of credit checks.1 The balance owed at\nthe time of the divorce hearing was $24,813. The largest debt of the parties, however, was\nthe primary mortgage on the marital home, the unpaid balance on which had greatly\nincreased as the result of a 2007 transaction whereby Husband bought property near the\nmarital home for use as a permanent location for his auto repair business.\n\n       The marital home was located at 612 New Shackle Island Road in Hendersonville.\nHusband testified that he had long had his eye on a 1.3 acre lot for Downing Motors at 608\nNew Shackle Island Road. The only structures on the property were a single wide trailer\nwith an addition built onto it and a barn. The owner had been unwilling to sell, but in 2007\nhe offered to sell the property to Husband for $90,000 if the purchase could be closed\nquickly. Husband agreed to the price without having the property appraised and even though\n\n\n\n\n        1\n        Husband entered six of those checks into the record as an exhibit to his testimony. Three of those\nchecks, with a total value of $900, were made out to Sherri Downing. Two checks made out to Billy\nDowning were in a different handwriting, and had a total value of $5,100. One check, in the same\nhandwriting as the those made out to Billy Downing, was made payable to Mr. Transmission for $1571.83.\n\n                                                   -4-\n\fit was not zoned for commercial use.2\n\n        Husband made a $5,000 down payment on the lot and borrowed $85,000 from his\nfather to pay the rest. He then attempted to obtain a bank loan to repay his father, but found\nthat he could not use the lot as collateral for the loan. On the advice of a Chase loan officer,\nHusband used the equity on the marital home instead. He borrowed enough money to not\nonly repay his father, but also to pay off some high interest credit card debt.\n\n        The marital home was appraised for property tax purposes at $228,200, but the\nappraiser testified at trial to an actual value of $195,000. Prior to the transaction involving\nthe lot, there was less than $30,000 of debt remaining on the first mortgage. Husband’s\nborrowing increased the balance owed on the home mortgage to $127,719. The transaction\nleft the business property at 608 New Shackle Island Road unencumbered.\n\n        Husband and Wife both signed the loan papers on the business property. Wife\ntestified that she trusted Husband to handle the parties’ financial matters, that he told her that\nthe loan was going to be secured by the lot itself, and that she only found out about the\nrefinancing of the mortgage on the marital home during the divorce proceedings. Husband\nconfirmed that he did not tell Wife that he used the marital home as collateral for the loan.\nThe parties agreed at trial that in the division of marital property Wife should get the marital\nhome and Husband should get the lot, but they did not agree as to the allocation of marital\ndebt.\n\n        At the conclusion of proof, the trial court took the matter under advisement. The court\nset out its decision in a brief unsigned letter ruling, which was used as the basis for the final\ndecree of divorce, filed on December 4, 2009. The court awarded Wife a divorce on the\nground of inappropriate marital conduct. Wife was also awarded custody of the minor child,\nand Husband was ordered to pay child support of $834 per month in accordance with the\nchild support guidelines, “until Cara Sheree Downing has graduated high school, at such time\nchild support would be recalculated on the basis of one (1) child.”\n\n        The list of marital property in the final decree of divorce included the two pieces of\nreal property discussed above, household goods, a boat, and numerous vehicles. The parties\nwere in agreement for the most part about the division of that property, although there were\nsome disputes as to valuation. The trial court divided the household goods and vehicles in\naccordance with the parties’ wishes, including the award of the marital home to Wife and of\nthe unimproved lot to Husband.\n\n\n        2\n         A subsequent appraisal of the property valued it at $65,000. Husband was unable to get the property\nrezoned for commercial use\n\n                                                    -5-\n\f       The court awarded Wife a lien of $103,518 on Husband’s lot, “which represents the\namount the Court has awarded the Husband to pay towards the Chase line of credit and the\nChase mortgage both of which are associated with the home awarded to the Wife at 612 New\nShackle Island Road, Hendersonville, Tennessee. This lien shall be attached to the lot\nlocated at 608 New Shackle Island Road, Hendersonville, Tennessee.” Husband was\nprohibited from disposing of any of his assets, including the lot, or from encumbering,\nmortgaging or borrowing against it “without the written agreement of the parties or approval\nof the court.”\n\n        The court’s list of marital property also included Wife’s 401(k) retirement account\nwith a total value of $44,000, and an IRS Income Tax refund check and a stimulus check\nwith a total value of $6,995.3 The two checks had already been deposited and spent by the\ntime the divorce complaint was filed. The court awarded Wife the entire 401(k) retirement\naccount, and the amounts of the two checks. As to these items of marital property, the court\nstated in its letter ruling that “[t]he Husband would have been entitled to $25,477. His\nportion goes to the wife as alimony in solido.” The Final Decree of Divorce, which was\ndrafted by Husband’s attorney and signed by the trial judge, awards Wife her 401(k) and the\ntwo checks as part of its division of marital property, however, and does not mention alimony\nat all.\n\n        Husband was ordered to take full responsibility for payment of the debt on the\nGreenBank credit card and the SunTrust credit card. He was also ordered to pay 60% of the\nChase credit card, 60% of the Chase line of credit, and 60% of the first mortgage on the\nmarital home. Wife was ordered to pay her MBNA and Kohl’s credit cards, 40% of the\nChase credit card, 40% of the Chase line of credit, and 40% of the first mortgage on the\nmarital home.4 Both parties were barred from making any further withdrawals on the Chase\nline of credit. The parties were ordered to equally split their son’s $1,080 orthodontic bill.\n\n        Wife filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment. She asked that the parenting plan\nand legal descriptions of the real property be incorporated into the final decree. Husband\nfiled a motion to stay the judgment pending the results of the appeal. The trial court granted\nWife’s request, and also amended its judgment by setting out a strict schedule for Husband\nto follow in paying off his obligations on the Chase line of credit and on the home mortgage.\n\n\n       3\n        The court also noted that Wife had a vested retirement plan, with a benefit of $1,088 per month\npayable when she reaches the age of 67, on March 1, 2028.\n       4\n        The trial court calculated Husband’s 60% share of the mortgage obligation as $88,631. However,\n60% of $127,719 is $76,631.40, not $88,631. The trial court also calculated Wife’s 40% share of the\nmortgage obligation as $39,088. 40% of $127,719 is $51,087.60\n\n                                                  -6-\n\fAmortization schedules for both obligations were incorporated into the court’s order. We\nwill discuss the schedule on the mortgage obligations in more detail in Section III(D) of this\nopinion. The court denied Husband’s motion to stay. This appeal followed.\n\n                                            III. A NALYSIS\n\n       A. The Standard of Review\n\n        In actions for divorce or for legal separation, Tennessee Code Annotated § 36-4-\n121(a)(1) authorizes the trial court to equitably divide, distribute, or assign the marital\nproperty “without regard to marital fault in proportions as the court deems just.” Jolly v.\nJolly, 130 S.W.3d 783, 785 (Tenn. 2004). The court is directed to consider all relevant\nfactors in its distribution of marital property, including those listed in Tennessee Code\nAnnotated § 36-4-121(c).5 Jolly v. Jolly, 130 S.W.3d at 786; Flannary v. Flannary, 121\nS.W.3d 647, 650 (Tenn. 2003), so long as the division is made without regard to marital\nfault.\n\n        The trial court’s task is to make an equitable, or fair, distribution of property. “The\ntrial court is empowered to do what is reasonable under the circumstances and has broad\ndiscretion in the equitable division of the marital estate.” Keyt v. Keyt, 244 S.W.3d 321, 328\n(Tenn. 2007) (citing Flannary, 121 S.W.3d at 650). Because the division of marital property\nis “not a mechanical process,” and because decisions regarding division of marital property\n\n\n       5\n        The factors the courts are directed to consider in making a division of the marital estate include:\n       (1) The duration of the marriage;\n       (2) The age, physical and mental health, vocational skills, employability, earning capacity,\n       estate,financial liabilities and financial needs of each of the parties;\n       (3) The tangible or intangible contributions by one (1) party to the education, training or increased\n       earning power of the other party;\n       (4) The relative ability of each party for future acquisitions of capital assets and income;\n       (5) The contribution of each party to the acquisition, preservation, appreciation or dissipation of the\n       marital or separate property, including the contribution of a party to the marriage as homemaker,\n       wage earner or parent, with the contribution of a party as homemaker or wage earner to be given the\n       same weight if each party has fulfilled his or her role;\n       (6) The value of the separate property of each party;\n       (7) The estate of each party at the time of the marriage;\n       (8) The economic circumstances of each party at the time the division of property is to become\n       effective;\n       (9) The tax consequences to each party; and\n       (10) Such other factors as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.\n\nTennessee Code Annotated § 36-4-121(c).\n\n                                                    -7-\n\fare fact-specific and many circumstances surrounding the property and the parties play a role,\na trial court has a great deal of discretion concerning the manner in which it divides marital\nproperty. Keyt, 244 S.W.3d at 328; Jolly, 130 S.W.3d at 785; Flannery, 121 S.W.3d at 650;\nSmith v. Smith, 984 S.W.2d 606, 609 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997).\n\n        As a general matter, reviewing courts will evaluate the fairness of a property division\nby its final results. Thompson v. Thompson, 797 S.W.2d 599, 604 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990).\nFurther, “unless the court’s decision is contrary to the preponderance of the evidence or is\nbased on an error of law, we will not interfere with the decision on appeal.” Sullivan v.\nSullivan, 107 S.W.3d 507, 512 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002) (citing Goodman v. Goodman, 8\nS.W.3d 289, 298 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999)). Thus, appellate courts ordinarily defer to the trial\ncourt’s decision unless it is inconsistent with the factors in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c)\nor is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Jolly, 130 S.W.3d at 785-86.\n\n       B. The Division of Property and Debt\n\n       Tennessee Code Annotated § 36-4-121(a)(1) requires the court to order an equitable\ndivision of marital property. An equitable division is not necessarily an equal division.\nLarsen Ball v. Ball, 301 S.W.3d 228, 231 (Tenn. 2010); Robertson v. Robertson, 76 S.W.3d\n337, 341 (Tenn. 2002); Smith v. Smith, 984 S.W.2d at 609. Husband complains that the trial\ncourt’s division of marital property and debt in this case was inequitable because it was very\none-sided in favor of Wife. He first observes that in accordance with the trial court’s own\nvaluations, the total value of the assets awarded to Wife, (including her 401(k)), amounted\nto $264,155, while the total value of the assets awarded to him amounted to only $93,600.\n\n       As we noted above, the vast majority of the assets were divided by mutual consent.\nThe major thrust of Husband’s argument, however, is that in light of the division of property,\nthe division of marital debt was inequitable. He complains that the debts the court ordered\nhim to pay amounted to $134,154, while Wife was only ordered to pay $53,370. All debts\nincurred by either or both parties during the course of a marriage are properly classified as\nmarital debt, and are subject to equitable division in the same manner as marital property.\nAlford v. Alford, 120 S.W.3d 810, 813 (Tenn. 2003). See also Cutsinger v. Cutsinger, 917\nS.W.2d 238, 243 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995); Mondelli v. Howard, 780 S.W.2d 769, 772 (Tenn.\nCt. App. 1989).\n\n       When dividing marital debt, our courts are directed to consider the same factors that\nare used to divide marital property, as well as, “(1) which party incurred the debt and the\ndebt’s purpose; (2) which party benefitted from incurring the debt; and (3) which party is best\nable to assume and repay the debt.” Mondelli v. Howard, 780 S.W.2d at 772 (citations\nomitted). When practicable, the debts should also follow the assets they purchased.\n\n                                              -8-\n\fMondelli v. Howard, 780 S.W.2d at 773.\n\n       In this case, the trial court divided the credit card debt by ordering Husband to pay off\nthe debts incurred on his GreenBank and SunTrust credit cards. According to Husband’s\ntestimony, he primarily used those cards to finance his business. We note that Husband did\nnot segregate the finances for his profit-making auto repair business from those for his\nmoney-losing drag racing enterprise.\n\n       Wife was ordered to pay the debt on her MBNA and Kohl’s credit cards. She testified\nthat she primarily used her cards for vacations and for the needs of her children. While it\ncould be argued that the debt Husband incurred because of his business expenses was for the\nbenefit of both parties, it could also be argued that the debt Wife incurred because of the\nchildren’s needs likewise benefitted both parties. We see nothing inequitable in the trial\ncourt dividing those debts as it did.\n\n       The trial court also ordered to Husband to pay 60% of the Chase credit card, 60% of\nthe Chase line of credit, and 60% of the first mortgage on the marital home. Husband argues\non appeal that it was not equitable for him to have to pay more than 50% of those debts. We\nnote, however, that all three of those debts were incurred by Husband in his role as manager\nof household finances. While he testified that the Chase credit card, which had a balance of\n$9,360 at the time of trial, was used “to support the lifestyle of my family,” he acknowledged\nthat the line of credit, whose balance was $24,813, was obtained for business purposes.\nNothing in the record convinces us that the allocation was inequitable or that the trial court\napplied an incorrect standard or reached a conclusion contrary to the facts.\n\n       As for the mortgage on the marital home, Husband decided to buy a piece of property\nfor Downing Motors without consulting Wife, and he used the marital home as collateral for\nthe purchase without even informing her that he was doing so. His action resulted in an\nincrease on the mortgage debt from less than $30,000 to $127,719. Husband admitted that\nhe made a bad decision. Among the factors the trial court is directed to consider in dividing\nmarital property is “[t]he contribution of each party to the acquisition, preservation,\nappreciation or dissipation of the marital or separate property . . .” Tennessee Code\nAnnotated § 36-4-121(c)(5). In this case, there is no doubt that both parties made substantial\ncontributions to the acquisition of the marital properties, but Husband’s “bad decision”\ndissipated the value of one of the prime assets of the parties, the equity in the marital home.\nThe evidence therefore does not preponderate against the trial court’s decision to make\nHusband responsible for 60% of the mortgage debt.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f       C. The Arguments About Alimony\n\n        Husband argues that the trial court erred by allowing Wife to keep 100% of her\ninterest in her 401(k) retirement account and in two government checks that were made\npayable to both parties and which were deposited and spent prior to the filing of the divorce\ncomplaint. Since the money represented by the two checks has already been spent, it did not\nexist at the time the trial court purported to award it. Our Courts cannot divide or award what\ndoes not exist. While the court can take that amount into consideration in determining where\nthe equities lie, the purported award itself was ineffectual. As for the 401(k) retirement\naccount, the proof showed that Wife acquired the entire account during the course of the\nmarriage. Thus, it is included in the statutory definition of marital property:\n\n       “Marital property” means all real and personal property, both tangible and\n       intangible, acquired by either or both spouses during the course of the marriage\n       up to the date of the final divorce hearing and owned by either or both spouses\n       as of the date of filing a complaint for divorce, . . .\n\n       Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(A). See also Snodgrass v. Snodgrass, 295 S.W.3d\n240, 243 (Tenn. 2009) (holding that funds deposited into a 401(k) during marriage are\nmarital assets).\n\n       The trial court was therefore entitled to determine the proper disposition of the 401(k)\npursuant to its authority under Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(a)(1) to equitably divide marital\nproperty. Depending on the equities of the situation, a court can divide the value of a\nretirement account between the parties or award the entire amount to one party or another.\nAs a practical matter, a court would not necessarily order that funds be directly withdrawn\nfrom a 401(k) account in order to accomplish a property division, because such a withdrawal\nwould likely result in tax consequences and possibly even an early withdrawal penalty, and\none of the factors the courts are directed to consider in division of marital property is “[t]he\ntax consequences to each party.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c)(9). Any decision as to a\nparticular asset is reviewed in the context of the overall distribution of the marital estate.\n\n       Because the trial court declared in its letter ruling that the 401(k) was awarded to Wife\nas alimony in solido, the parties focused all their arguments on the propriety of such an\nalimony award under the circumstances of this case. Husband argued that the trial court\nshould not have ordered alimony because Wife did not ask for it in her counter-complaint and\nbecause there was no evidence that the court considered the statutory factors that must be\napplied before alimony is granted. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i).\n\n       Although the court’s unsigned letter ruling did speak of Wife’s 401(k) account in\n\n                                              -10-\n\fterms of alimony in solido, the final order in the record signed by the trial judge does not\nmention alimony, but instead treats its award of the 401(k) account to Wife as a division of\nmarital property.6 “A court speaks only through its written judgments, duly entered upon its\nminutes.” Green v. Moore, 101 S.W.3d 415, 419 (Tenn. 2003) (quoting Evans v. Perkey, 647\nS.W.2d 636, 640 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982)); Environmental Abatement v. Astrum R.E., 27\nS.W.3d 530, 536 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000). Further, “the signature of the judge is mandatory\nto effectuate a judgment or order of final disposition.” Green v. Moore, 101 S.W.3d at 420.\nSee also 58 Tenn. R. Civ. P.; Ball v. McDowell, 288 S.W.3d 833 (Tenn. 2009).\n\n        We therefore need not consider whether alimony was appropriate in this case, but only\nwhether the award of the 401(k) account to Wife is consistent with an equitable division of\nthe entire marital state. This was a marriage of long duration, both parties contributed to the\nacquisition of marital assets, and Wife will be receiving a much larger portion of the marital\nassets, even without considering the 401(k). Further, Husband did not enjoy the same\nopportunity that Wife did to acquire a tax-advantaged retirement account through his work.\n\n         However, Husband managed all the finances for the family starting in 1998, and he\nhad enough income left over after paying for family and business expenses to contribute to\na savings account or open a retirement account. Instead, he chose to use any surplus for his\nhobby. We cannot fault him for doing what he enjoyed, but the proof showed that he raced\nfor at least ten years and that he lost on the average about $9,000 each year, thereby incurring\ntotal losses of greater magnitude than the value of the 401(k) account. We are therefore\nunable to conclude that it was inequitable to allow Wife to retain the full benefit of the\nretirement account that she established during the parties’ marriage. More importantly, we\ncannot find that the trial court’s distribution of the whole marital estate was inequitable.\n\n        D. Wife’s Issue\n\n        Wife raises one issue of her own on appeal, involving Husband’s payment schedule\non his home mortgage obligation. In its order amending the final judgment, the trial court\ndeclared that the Husband’s 60% obligation on the home mortgage amounted to $88,631, and\nit divided that obligation into two parts. The court ordered Husband to pay $30,000 at a rate\nof $1,000 per year plus interest over 336 months. The order recited that Husband’s payments\non that obligation would come to $198.96 in accordance with an attached amortization table.\n\n        The court ordered the remainder of the Husband’s obligation ($58,631) to be paid over\n\n\n        6\n         Another document in the record, also titled Final Decree of Divorce, drafted by Wife’s attorney,\nbut not signed by the trial judge, declares, consistent with the court’s letter ruling, that the 401(k) and the\ntwo checks are awarded to Wife as alimony in solido.\n\n                                                     -11-\n\fthe life of the mortgage, with the husband paying $388.84 a month, 60% of $648.88, which\nis the monthly obligation over the same period on the remaining mortgage debt in accordance\nwith another attached amortization table. Wife argues that the payment schedule is\ninequitable, because she cannot refinance the mortgages while Husband’s name is on the\ndeed. She therefore asks this court to accelerate Husband’s obligation by ordering him to tap\ninto the equity in his lot and apply it to the mortgage on the home so that the mortgage can be\nmore quickly paid off.\n\n        While we sympathize with Wife’s plight, we are mindful that the division of marital\nproperty and debt has left Husband with heavy obligations of payment and very little in the\nway of assets other than that single unencumbered piece of property. We are also aware that\nafter the mortgage on the marital home is paid off, Husband will not share in the valuable\nequity, which will belong solely to Wife. Under the circumstances, we find no basis to\nreverse the trial court’s decision on this issue.\n\n        It also appears that the trial court incorrectly calculated Husband’s share of the home\nmortgage obligation. The court ordered him to pay 60% of the mortgage, and recited that this\namounted to $88,631. However, 60% of a mortgage debt of $127,719 amounts to $76,631.40,\nnot $88,631. As we noted, the Court declared that it was breaking Husband’s total obligation\nof $88,631 into portions valued at $30,000 and $58,631 respectively, and it calculated\nmonthly obligations for each of those parts. Unless we are mistaken, the size of the obligation\non at least one of these parts must be incorrect.\n\n        We accordingly vacate that portion of the amended final decree that created a specific\npayment schedule for Husband’s obligation on the home mortgage, and we remand this case\nto the trial court so it can amend its order to correctly reflect Husband’s monthly obligation\nto pay 60% of the mortgage on the marital home. At the request of the parties, the trial court\nmay also simplify Husband’s obligation by requiring him to make only one payment a month\non the home mortgage rather than two.7\n\n\n\n\n        7\n          We note that the court offered no explanation for its decision to divide the mortgage obligation into\ntwo parts. We cannot see any advantage for either party in compelling Husband to make two separate\npayments each month on what the evidence indicates to be a single obligation. We note that the amortization\ntables incorporated into the trial court’s order show that the balances on both parts of Husband’s obligation\nare amortized for the same period (336 months) and at the same interest rate (6.75%).\n\n                                                     -12-\n\f                                            IV.\n\n       The judgment of the trial court as to the division of marital property and debt is\naffirmed, but the court-ordered schedule for Husband’s payment of the home mortgage is\nvacated. We remand this case to the General Sessions Court of Sumner County for further\nproceedings. Tax two-thirds of the costs on appeal to the appellant, William J. Downing, and\none-third to the appellee, Sherrie J. Downing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   _________________________________\n                                                   PATRICIA J. COTTRELL, JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\f       It is unclear why the trial court chose to characterize the IRS check and the stimulus\ncheck as property subject to division. The Wife’s attorney stated during oral argument that\nthe checks were deposited into the parties’ joint account, and that Wife withdrew it and used\nmost of it to go on a mission trip and the rest for the cheerleader expenses of the parties’\ndaughter. Further, the money was spent prior to the filing of the divorce complaint.\n\nAll debts incurred by either or both parties during the course of a marriage are properly\nclassified as marital debt. Alford v. Alford, 120 S.W.3d 810, 811 (Tenn. 2003).\n\nWhen we look more closely at the property division, however, the imbalance is not quite as\ngreat as it first appears. Husband asked the trial court to award Wife the most valuable marital\nasset by far: the marital home at 608 New Shackle Island Road, which the court valued at\n$195,000. For his part, Husband asked for and received the lot at 608 New Shackle Island\nRoad, which the court valued at $65,000. When the two items of real property that were\ndivided by mutual consent are removed from the equation, the value of the property awarded\nto Wife (including the alimony in solido) amounts to $69,155, while the value of the property\nawarded Husband amounts to $28,600.\n\nAlthough Husband had paid $90,000 for the property, it was only valued at only $65,000.\nSince the decision to buy the property for $90,000 was Husband’s alone, it seems\n\nProperty at 608 New Shackle Island Road appraised at $65,000 - had a single wide trailer with\nan addition built onto it and a barn. Appraiser didn’t add any value for the structures.\nTax appraisal = $68,000?\n\nand was comprised of a Chase line of credit with a balance of $14,887, and a Chase mortgage\nwith a balance of $88,631.\n\nWife’s 2008 W-2 and 1040 showed wages of $28,115. social security income was more.\n\nBoth parties worked during the marriage and contributed their earnings to the household\nexpenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -14-\n\f",

The court also made the husband\nresponsible for 60% of the mortgage obligation on the marital home and allowed the wife to\nretain her entire 401(k) retirement account. The husband contends on appeal that the division\nof property and debt was inequitable and that the trial court impermissibly awarded the wife\nher 401(k) account in the form of alimony in solido. We affirm the division of marital\nproperty and marital debt. We also find that there was no alimony award, because the final\norder in this case, signed by the judge, treats the 401(k) as part of the division of marital\nproperty rather than as alimony. However, it appears to us that the trial court made some\ncalculating errors when it ordered the husband to pay specific monthly amounts on the home\nmortgage.

Downing.\n\f                                        OPINION\n\n                          I. A M ARRIAGE OF L ONG D URATION\n\n       William J. Downing (“Husband”) and Sherrie J. Downing (“Wife”) married in 1983.\nThe two children who were born of their marriage were aged 18 and 14 at the time of the\nparties’s divorce. Wife worked during the entirety of the marriage at Lifeway Christian\nResources (formerly the Baptist Sunday School Board) in Nashville. Husband also worked\nsteadily during the marriage, mostly at jobs involving automotive sales. In 2000, he began\noperating his own automobile repair business out of the garage behind the marital home, and\nhe continued in that business up to and including the time of divorce.\n\n       In December of 2008, Husband announced to Wife that he was unhappy and that he\nno longer loved her. Shortly thereafter, he moved out of the marital home. On January 2,\n2009, he filed a complaint for divorce in the General Sessions Court of Sumner County,\nalleging that there were irreconcilable differences between the parties. See Tenn. Code Ann.\n§ 36-4-129. He also stated that both parties were fit and proper parents, but he did not ask\nfor custody of the children.\n\n        On March 25, 2009, Wife filed a motion for pendente lite support. On the same day,\nshe filed a motion for exclusive possession of the marital home. Wife alleged that after\nleaving the marital home and moving in with his father, Husband had stopped making\npayments on the parties’ extensive credit card bills and that he had only contributed $245\ntowards the care of the children since his departure. Wife accordingly asked the court to\norder Husband “to contribute to the marital bills and expenses and provide sufficient support\nfor her and the children in at least the amount that he has always paid monthly during the\nmarriage, pending further orders of this Honorable Court.” There is no indication in the\ntechnical record that a hearing was ever conducted on Wife’s motion.\n\n       Husband subsequently amended his complaint to allege inappropriate marital conduct\non the part of Wife as an additional ground for divorce. Wife filed an answer and counter\ncomplaint for divorce on June 24, 2009. She admitted that there were irreconcilable\ndifferences between the parties, denied that she was guilty of any inappropriate conduct, and\nsuggested that Husband was himself guilty of inappropriate marital conduct. She asked for\nan equitable division of marital property and for custody of the children. Her counter\ncomplaint did not include a request for alimony, an omission that is the basis of one of\nHusband’s arguments on appeal. Shortly thereafter, Wife and her attorney parted ways, and\nshe retained new counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f       On September 2, 2009, Wife filed a motion to amend her counter complaint. She\nmentioned her earlier request for pendente lite support, stated that her prior counsel had\ninadvertently left the request for alimony out of her counter complaint, and declared that\n“there is a need for alimony in this matter.” In a trial memorandum, filed on October 1,\n2009, Wife repeated her request for alimony, and asked the court to award her $1,000 per\nmonth. There is no order in the technical record that indicates a ruling on Wife’s motion to\namend.\n\n                                II. T HE D IVORCE H EARING\n\n        The final divorce hearing was conducted on October 2, 2009. Aside from the parties,\nthe only witnesses to testify were a professional appraiser and a private investigator who\nWife had hired to find evidence of infidelity against Husband. Despite the lack of an order\nin the technical record regarding Mother’s motion to amend her counter complaint to request\nalimony, Husband’s attorney acknowledged during his opening argument that the trial court\nhad granted her motion.\n\n        The testimony of the parties mostly involved financial matters. Their joint income tax\nreturns from 2005 to 2008 were entered into the record, and showed that both parties earned\nfairly reliable incomes. In response to an interrogatory, Wife stated that her annual income\nwas $37,659. However, her 2008 W-2 form from Lifeway showed Social Security income\nof $31,202, and she suggested that the higher figure was a mistake. Husband’s Profit or Loss\nStatement from the same year showed gross receipts of $109,595. The “cost of goods sold”\n(presumably auto parts and supplies) was listed at $49,852, leaving gross income of $59,743.\nHe reported additional expenses of $24,044, resulting in a profit of $35,699.\n\n       There was no evidence that the parties, despite their income, had saved any money.\nThere was no discussion during trial of any savings accounts, certificates of deposit, or of any\ninvestments, other than those in wife’s 401(k) retirement account. The evidence showed that\nthe parties spent everything they earned, and then some. Wife testified that all her spending\nwas for the benefit of the children, and that she would not skimp on them so long as Husband\ncontinued to “throw money out the window” by drag racing.\n\n        Husband acknowledged that he has participated in drag racing for a long time, owning\ncars and racing them on a weekly basis. Referring to the costs, he stated that “you spend a\nlot of money real quick if you don’t watch it.” He testified that aside from maintenance and\nfuel costs, there is usually a $50 entry fee to race. There are also prizes for winners, usually\n$1,300 but sometimes quite a bit more: $5,000, $10,000, or even $100,000. Husband races\nfor pleasure, but he chooses to treat drag racing as a business for tax purposes. Although he\nwins some races, his tax records and his testimony show average losses of about $9,000\n\n                                              -3-\n\fannually.\n\n      It was undisputed that Husband took over the family’s finances in 1998, that he was\nresponsible for paying the bills, and that Wife trusted his judgment on financial matters. But\nHusband testified, “I am behind on a lot of bills.” The proof showed that the parties had\naccumulated a significant amount of credit card debt by the time of the divorce hearing.\n\n        Husband testified that a SunTrust card in his name was used for his business and also\nfor car expenses, including vehicles belonging to his wife and daughter. That card had a\nbalance of $10,178. He also testified to a $13,839 balance on a GreenBank credit card that\nhe used solely for business expenses. Husband also had a Chase credit card with a balance\nof $9,630 that Wife did not know about, but that Husband insisted he used “to support the\nlifestyle of my family.” However, other than that one statement during his testimony, he did\nnot present any evidence that he used that card for family purposes. Wife also had her own\nMNBA credit card, which she testified she used for vacations and for the children’s needs.\nShe also had a Kohl’s Department Store card. The balance on the MNBA card was about\n$8,000, and the balance on the Kohl’s card was about $800.\n\n       Husband had also obtained a line of credit for business purposes from Chase Home\nFinance that was secured by a second mortgage on the marital home. Although the line of\ncredit was in Husband’s name only, he testified that Wife used it on several occasions\nwithout his permission by signing his name on line of credit checks.1 The balance owed at\nthe time of the divorce hearing was $24,813. The largest debt of the parties, however, was\nthe primary mortgage on the marital home, the unpaid balance on which had greatly\nincreased as the result of a 2007 transaction whereby Husband bought property near the\nmarital home for use as a permanent location for his auto repair business.\n\n       The marital home was located at 612 New Shackle Island Road in Hendersonville.\nHusband testified that he had long had his eye on a 1.3 acre lot for Downing Motors at 608\nNew Shackle Island Road. The only structures on the property were a single wide trailer\nwith an addition built onto it and a barn. The owner had been unwilling to sell, but in 2007\nhe offered to sell the property to Husband for $90,000 if the purchase could be closed\nquickly. Husband agreed to the price without having the property appraised and even though\n\n\n\n\n        1\n        Husband entered six of those checks into the record as an exhibit to his testimony. Three of those\nchecks, with a total value of $900, were made out to Sherri Downing. Two checks made out to Billy\nDowning were in a different handwriting, and had a total value of $5,100. One check, in the same\nhandwriting as the those made out to Billy Downing, was made payable to Mr. Transmission for $1571.83.\n\n                                                   -4-\n\fit was not zoned for commercial use.2\n\n        Husband made a $5,000 down payment on the lot and borrowed $85,000 from his\nfather to pay the rest. He then attempted to obtain a bank loan to repay his father, but found\nthat he could not use the lot as collateral for the loan. On the advice of a Chase loan officer,\nHusband used the equity on the marital home instead. He borrowed enough money to not\nonly repay his father, but also to pay off some high interest credit card debt.\n\n        The marital home was appraised for property tax purposes at $228,200, but the\nappraiser testified at trial to an actual value of $195,000. Prior to the transaction involving\nthe lot, there was less than $30,000 of debt remaining on the first mortgage. Husband’s\nborrowing increased the balance owed on the home mortgage to $127,719. The transaction\nleft the business property at 608 New Shackle Island Road unencumbered.\n\n        Husband and Wife both signed the loan papers on the business property. Wife\ntestified that she trusted Husband to handle the parties’ financial matters, that he told her that\nthe loan was going to be secured by the lot itself, and that she only found out about the\nrefinancing of the mortgage on the marital home during the divorce proceedings. Husband\nconfirmed that he did not tell Wife that he used the marital home as collateral for the loan.\nThe parties agreed at trial that in the division of marital property Wife should get the marital\nhome and Husband should get the lot, but they did not agree as to the allocation of marital\ndebt.\n\n        At the conclusion of proof, the trial court took the matter under advisement. The court\nset out its decision in a brief unsigned letter ruling, which was used as the basis for the final\ndecree of divorce, filed on December 4, 2009. The court awarded Wife a divorce on the\nground of inappropriate marital conduct. Wife was also awarded custody of the minor child,\nand Husband was ordered to pay child support of $834 per month in accordance with the\nchild support guidelines, “until Cara Sheree Downing has graduated high school, at such time\nchild support would be recalculated on the basis of one (1) child.”\n\n        The list of marital property in the final decree of divorce included the two pieces of\nreal property discussed above, household goods, a boat, and numerous vehicles. The parties\nwere in agreement for the most part about the division of that property, although there were\nsome disputes as to valuation. The trial court divided the household goods and vehicles in\naccordance with the parties’ wishes, including the award of the marital home to Wife and of\nthe unimproved lot to Husband.\n\n\n        2\n         A subsequent appraisal of the property valued it at $65,000. Husband was unable to get the property\nrezoned for commercial use\n\n                                                    -5-\n\f       The court awarded Wife a lien of $103,518 on Husband’s lot, “which represents the\namount the Court has awarded the Husband to pay towards the Chase line of credit and the\nChase mortgage both of which are associated with the home awarded to the Wife at 612 New\nShackle Island Road, Hendersonville, Tennessee. This lien shall be attached to the lot\nlocated at 608 New Shackle Island Road, Hendersonville, Tennessee.” Husband was\nprohibited from disposing of any of his assets, including the lot, or from encumbering,\nmortgaging or borrowing against it “without the written agreement of the parties or approval\nof the court.”\n\n        The court’s list of marital property also included Wife’s 401(k) retirement account\nwith a total value of $44,000, and an IRS Income Tax refund check and a stimulus check\nwith a total value of $6,995.3 The two checks had already been deposited and spent by the\ntime the divorce complaint was filed. The court awarded Wife the entire 401(k) retirement\naccount, and the amounts of the two checks. As to these items of marital property, the court\nstated in its letter ruling that “[t]he Husband would have been entitled to $25,477. His\nportion goes to the wife as alimony in solido.” The Final Decree of Divorce, which was\ndrafted by Husband’s attorney and signed by the trial judge, awards Wife her 401(k) and the\ntwo checks as part of its division of marital property, however, and does not mention alimony\nat all.\n\n        Husband was ordered to take full responsibility for payment of the debt on the\nGreenBank credit card and the SunTrust credit card. He was also ordered to pay 60% of the\nChase credit card, 60% of the Chase line of credit, and 60% of the first mortgage on the\nmarital home. Wife was ordered to pay her MBNA and Kohl’s credit cards, 40% of the\nChase credit card, 40% of the Chase line of credit, and 40% of the first mortgage on the\nmarital home.4 Both parties were barred from making any further withdrawals on the Chase\nline of credit. The parties were ordered to equally split their son’s $1,080 orthodontic bill.\n\n        Wife filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment. She asked that the parenting plan\nand legal descriptions of the real property be incorporated into the final decree. Husband\nfiled a motion to stay the judgment pending the results of the appeal. The trial court granted\nWife’s request, and also amended its judgment by setting out a strict schedule for Husband\nto follow in paying off his obligations on the Chase line of credit and on the home mortgage.\n\n\n       3\n        The court also noted that Wife had a vested retirement plan, with a benefit of $1,088 per month\npayable when she reaches the age of 67, on March 1, 2028.\n       4\n        The trial court calculated Husband’s 60% share of the mortgage obligation as $88,631. However,\n60% of $127,719 is $76,631.40, not $88,631. The trial court also calculated Wife’s 40% share of the\nmortgage obligation as $39,088. 40% of $127,719 is $51,087.60\n\n                                                  -6-\n\fAmortization schedules for both obligations were incorporated into the court’s order. We\nwill discuss the schedule on the mortgage obligations in more detail in Section III(D) of this\nopinion. The court denied Husband’s motion to stay. This appeal followed.\n\n                                            III. A NALYSIS\n\n       A.

He first observes that in accordance with the trial court’s own\nvaluations, the total value of the assets awarded to Wife, (including her 401(k)), amounted\nto $264,155, while the total value of the assets awarded to him amounted to only $93,600.\n\n       As we noted above, the vast majority of the assets were divided by mutual consent.\nThe major thrust of Husband’s argument, however, is that in light of the division of property,\nthe division of marital debt was inequitable. He complains that the debts the court ordered\nhim to pay amounted to $134,154, while Wife was only ordered to pay $53,370. All debts\nincurred by either or both parties during the course of a marriage are properly classified as\nmarital debt, and are subject to equitable division in the same manner as marital property.\nAlford v.

Howard, 780 S.W.2d at 772 (citations\nomitted). When practicable, the debts should also follow the assets they purchased.\n\n                                              -8-\n\fMondelli v. Howard, 780 S.W.2d at 773.\n\n       In this case, the trial court divided the credit card debt by ordering Husband to pay off\nthe debts incurred on his GreenBank and SunTrust credit cards. According to Husband’s\ntestimony, he primarily used those cards to finance his business. We note that Husband did\nnot segregate the finances for his profit-making auto repair business from those for his\nmoney-losing drag racing enterprise.\n\n       Wife was ordered to pay the debt on her MBNA and Kohl’s credit cards. She testified\nthat she primarily used her cards for vacations and for the needs of her children. While it\ncould be argued that the debt Husband incurred because of his business expenses was for the\nbenefit of both parties, it could also be argued that the debt Wife incurred because of the\nchildren’s needs likewise benefitted both parties. We see nothing inequitable in the trial\ncourt dividing those debts as it did.\n\n       The trial court also ordered to Husband to pay 60% of the Chase credit card, 60% of\nthe Chase line of credit, and 60% of the first mortgage on the marital home. Husband argues\non appeal that it was not equitable for him to have to pay more than 50% of those debts. We\nnote, however, that all three of those debts were incurred by Husband in his role as manager\nof household finances. While he testified that the Chase credit card, which had a balance of\n$9,360 at the time of trial, was used “to support the lifestyle of my family,” he acknowledged\nthat the line of credit, whose balance was $24,813, was obtained for business purposes.\nNothing in the record convinces us that the allocation was inequitable or that the trial court\napplied an incorrect standard or reached a conclusion contrary to the facts.\n\n       As for the mortgage on the marital home, Husband decided to buy a piece of property\nfor Downing Motors without consulting Wife, and he used the marital home as collateral for\nthe purchase without even informing her that he was doing so. His action resulted in an\nincrease on the mortgage debt from less than $30,000 to $127,719. Husband admitted that\nhe made a bad decision. Among the factors the trial court is directed to consider in dividing\nmarital property is “[t]he contribution of each party to the acquisition, preservation,\nappreciation or dissipation of the marital or separate property . . .” Tennessee Code\nAnnotated § 36-4-121(c)(5). In this case, there is no doubt that both parties made substantial\ncontributions to the acquisition of the marital properties, but Husband’s “bad decision”\ndissipated the value of one of the prime assets of the parties, the equity in the marital home.\nThe evidence therefore does not preponderate against the trial court’s decision to make\nHusband responsible for 60% of the mortgage debt.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f       C. The Arguments About Alimony\n\n        Husband argues that the trial court erred by allowing Wife to keep 100% of her\ninterest in her 401(k) retirement account and in two government checks that were made\npayable to both parties and which were deposited and spent prior to the filing of the divorce\ncomplaint. Since the money represented by the two checks has already been spent, it did not\nexist at the time the trial court purported to award it. Our Courts cannot divide or award what\ndoes not exist. While the court can take that amount into consideration in determining where\nthe equities lie, the purported award itself was ineffectual. As for the 401(k) retirement\naccount, the proof showed that Wife acquired the entire account during the course of the\nmarriage. Thus, it is included in the statutory definition of marital property:\n\n       “Marital property” means all real and personal property, both tangible and\n       intangible, acquired by either or both spouses during the course of the marriage\n       up to the date of the final divorce hearing and owned by either or both spouses\n       as of the date of filing a complaint for divorce, . . .\n\n       Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(A). See also Snodgrass v. Snodgrass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057654/snodgrass-v-snodgrass/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243 (Tenn. 2009) (holding that funds deposited into a 401(k) during marriage are\nmarital assets).\n\n       The trial court was therefore entitled to determine the proper disposition of the 401(k)\npursuant to its authority under Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(a)(1) to equitably divide marital\nproperty. Depending on the equities of the situation, a court can divide the value of a\nretirement account between the parties or award the entire amount to one party or another.\nAs a practical matter, a court would not necessarily order that funds be directly withdrawn\nfrom a 401(k) account in order to accomplish a property division, because such a withdrawal\nwould likely result in tax consequences and possibly even an early withdrawal penalty, and\none of the factors the courts are directed to consider in division of marital property is “[t]he\ntax consequences to each party.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c)(9). Any decision as to a\nparticular asset is reviewed in the context of the overall distribution of the marital estate.\n\n       Because the trial court declared in its letter ruling that the 401(k) was awarded to Wife\nas alimony in solido, the parties focused all their arguments on the propriety of such an\nalimony award under the circumstances of this case. Husband argued that the trial court\nshould not have ordered alimony because Wife did not ask for it in her counter-complaint and\nbecause there was no evidence that the court considered the statutory factors that must be\napplied before alimony is granted. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i).\n\n       Although the court’s unsigned letter ruling did speak of Wife’s 401(k) account in\n\n                                              -10-\n\fterms of alimony in solido, the final order in the record signed by the trial judge does not\nmention alimony, but instead treats its award of the 401(k) account to Wife as a division of\nmarital property.6 “A court speaks only through its written judgments, duly entered upon its\nminutes.” Green v.

This was a marriage of long duration, both parties contributed to the\nacquisition of marital assets, and Wife will be receiving a much larger portion of the marital\nassets, even without considering the 401(k). Further, Husband did not enjoy the same\nopportunity that Wife did to acquire a tax-advantaged retirement account through his work.\n\n         However, Husband managed all the finances for the family starting in 1998, and he\nhad enough income left over after paying for family and business expenses to contribute to\na savings account or open a retirement account. Instead, he chose to use any surplus for his\nhobby. We cannot fault him for doing what he enjoyed, but the proof showed that he raced\nfor at least ten years and that he lost on the average about $9,000 each year, thereby incurring\ntotal losses of greater magnitude than the value of the 401(k) account. We are therefore\nunable to conclude that it was inequitable to allow Wife to retain the full benefit of the\nretirement account that she established during the parties’ marriage. More importantly, we\ncannot find that the trial court’s distribution of the whole marital estate was inequitable.\n\n        D. Wife’s Issue\n\n        Wife raises one issue of her own on appeal, involving Husband’s payment schedule\non his home mortgage obligation. In its order amending the final judgment, the trial court\ndeclared that the Husband’s 60% obligation on the home mortgage amounted to $88,631, and\nit divided that obligation into two parts. The court ordered Husband to pay $30,000 at a rate\nof $1,000 per year plus interest over 336 months. The order recited that Husband’s payments\non that obligation would come to $198.96 in accordance with an attached amortization table.\n\n        The court ordered the remainder of the Husband’s obligation ($58,631) to be paid over\n\n\n        6\n         Another document in the record, also titled Final Decree of Divorce, drafted by Wife’s attorney,\nbut not signed by the trial judge, declares, consistent with the court’s letter ruling, that the 401(k) and the\ntwo checks are awarded to Wife as alimony in solido.\n\n                                                     -11-\n\fthe life of the mortgage, with the husband paying $388.84 a month, 60% of $648.88, which\nis the monthly obligation over the same period on the remaining mortgage debt in accordance\nwith another attached amortization table. Wife argues that the payment schedule is\ninequitable, because she cannot refinance the mortgages while Husband’s name is on the\ndeed. She therefore asks this court to accelerate Husband’s obligation by ordering him to tap\ninto the equity in his lot and apply it to the mortgage on the home so that the mortgage can be\nmore quickly paid off.\n\n        While we sympathize with Wife’s plight, we are mindful that the division of marital\nproperty and debt has left Husband with heavy obligations of payment and very little in the\nway of assets other than that single unencumbered piece of property. We are also aware that\nafter the mortgage on the marital home is paid off, Husband will not share in the valuable\nequity, which will belong solely to Wife. Under the circumstances, we find no basis to\nreverse the trial court’s decision on this issue.\n\n        It also appears that the trial court incorrectly calculated Husband’s share of the home\nmortgage obligation. The court ordered him to pay 60% of the mortgage, and recited that this\namounted to $88,631. However, 60% of a mortgage debt of $127,719 amounts to $76,631.40,\nnot $88,631. As we noted, the Court declared that it was breaking Husband’s total obligation\nof $88,631 into portions valued at $30,000 and $58,631 respectively, and it calculated\nmonthly obligations for each of those parts. Unless we are mistaken, the size of the obligation\non at least one of these parts must be incorrect.\n\n        We accordingly vacate that portion of the amended final decree that created a specific\npayment schedule for Husband’s obligation on the home mortgage, and we remand this case\nto the trial court so it can amend its order to correctly reflect Husband’s monthly obligation\nto pay 60% of the mortgage on the marital home. At the request of the parties, the trial court\nmay also simplify Husband’s obligation by requiring him to make only one payment a month\non the home mortgage rather than two.7\n\n\n\n\n        7\n          We note that the court offered no explanation for its decision to divide the mortgage obligation into\ntwo parts. We cannot see any advantage for either party in compelling Husband to make two separate\npayments each month on what the evidence indicates to be a single obligation. We note that the amortization\ntables incorporated into the trial court’s order show that the balances on both parts of Husband’s obligation\nare amortized for the same period (336 months) and at the same interest rate (6.75%).\n\n                                                     -12-\n\f                                            IV.\n\n       The judgment of the trial court as to the division of marital property and debt is\naffirmed, but the court-ordered schedule for Husband’s payment of the home mortgage is\nvacated. We remand this case to the General Sessions Court of Sumner County for further\nproceedings. Tax two-thirds of the costs on appeal to the appellant, William J. Downing, and\none-third to the appellee, Sherrie J. Downing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   _________________________________\n                                                   PATRICIA J. COTTRELL, JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\f       It is unclear why the trial court chose to characterize the IRS check and the stimulus\ncheck as property subject to division. The Wife’s attorney stated during oral argument that\nthe checks were deposited into the parties’ joint account, and that Wife withdrew it and used\nmost of it to go on a mission trip and the rest for the cheerleader expenses of the parties’\ndaughter. Further, the money was spent prior to the filing of the divorce complaint.\n\nAll debts incurred by either or both parties during the course of a marriage are properly\nclassified as marital debt. Alford v. Alford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1587029\"><a href=\"/opinion/1587029/alford-v-alford/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (Tenn. 2003).\n\nWhen we look more closely at the property division, however, the imbalance is not quite as\ngreat as it first appears. Husband asked the trial court to award Wife the most valuable marital\nasset by far: the marital home at 608 New Shackle Island Road, which the court valued at\n$195,000. For his part, Husband asked for and received the lot at 608 New Shackle Island\nRoad, which the court valued at $65,000. When the two items of real property that were\ndivided by mutual consent are removed from the equation, the value of the property awarded\nto Wife (including the alimony in solido) amounts to $69,155, while the value of the property\nawarded Husband amounts to $28,600.\n\nAlthough Husband had paid $90,000 for the property, it was only valued at only $65,000.\nSince the decision to buy the property for $90,000 was Husband’s alone, it seems\n\nProperty at 608 New Shackle Island Road appraised at $65,000 - had a single wide trailer with\nan addition built onto it and a barn. Appraiser didn’t add any value for the structures.\nTax appraisal = $68,000?\n\nand was comprised of a Chase line of credit with a balance of $14,887, and a Chase mortgage\nwith a balance of $88,631.\n\nWife’s 2008 W-2 and 1040 showed wages of $28,115. social security income was more.\n\nBoth parties worked during the marriage and contributed their earnings to the household\nexpenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -14-\n\f</pre>",
