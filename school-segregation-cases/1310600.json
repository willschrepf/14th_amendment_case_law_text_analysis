He requests the appointment of counsel.   The appeal has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 9(a), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.

He alleged that he was wrongfully placed on a grievance restriction, placed on a \"cigarette light\" restriction and placed in punitive segregation.   He further maintained that defendants were indifferent to his serious medical needs and refused his request to enter a legal agreement with another prisoner.   Additionally, Brown claimed that defendants' conduct is racist and retaliatory because he is black and he has filed numerous grievances and lawsuits to challenge defendants' unlawful practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon review, we conclude that summary judgment was proper because there exists no genuine issue of material fact and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986);   Anderson v.

See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976);   Westlake v. Lucas, 537 F.2d 857, 860 (6th Cir.1976).   Brown's claim that he was placed on a cigarette light restriction in violation of due process also lacks merit.   Brown is not entitled to due process protections where he has not alleged the loss of a protected property or liberty interest.   Cf. Kentucky Dep't of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 459 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Brown's claims that he was denied access to the court.

He did not show that retaliation was \"a substantial or motivating factor\" in defendants' conduct.   See Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).   His allegations of retaliation, like his allegations of racism, were merely conclusory and devoid of any factual support.   See Place v.
