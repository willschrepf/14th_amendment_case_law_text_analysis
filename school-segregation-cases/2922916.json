FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Petitioner Fred Lawrence Robinson appeals the district\ncourt’s denial of his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. Rob-\ninson faces a death sentence imposed by the state of Arizona\nfor the murder of Sterleen Hill. Robinson sought relief from\nhis sentence and conviction on ten grounds in his petition to\nthe district court. Following denial of the petition, the district\ncourt granted a certificate of appealability as to four issues,\nand we subsequently certified an additional five issues for\nappeal. We have jurisdiction over this pre-AEDPA appeal\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and reverse in part and remand\nin part the district court’s determination. We hold that the Ari-\n\f                        ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                      2717\nzona courts arbitrarily found that Robinson committed the\nmurder in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment and that Robinson\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing in vio-\nlation of the Sixth Amendment. We reverse the district court’s\ndenial of those claims and remand to the district court for\nissuance of a writ of habeas corpus striking the application of\nthe especially cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravating factor\nto Robinson and ordering a new sentencing proceeding. We\naffirm the district court’s denial of Robinson’s remaining\nclaims in a memorandum disposition filed concurrently with\nthis opinion.\n\n          I.   Factual and Procedural Background\n\n                         A.    The Crime1\n\n  At around 6 p.m. on June 8, 1987, Robinson drove from\nBanning, California, to Yuma, Arizona with two friends, The-\nodore Washington (“Washington”) and Jimmy Lee Mathers\n(“Mathers”). Earlier that afternoon, Robinson told his son,\nAndre, that the three men were going to Yuma to see if Susan\nHill (“Susan”), Robinson’s common law wife, was there. As\nAndre looked on, the three men loaded two handguns and a\nshot gun into Robinson’s car.\n\n   At around 11:30 p.m., Sterleen Hill (“Sterleen”), Susan’s\nstepmother, heard sounds outside the Hills’ house in Yuma.\nShe told her son LeSean to investigate, but he saw no one. At\napproximately 11:45, someone knocked on the door. When\nLeSean opened it, a man identified himself as James and told\nLeSean that he had some money for Ralph Hill (“Ralph”),\nSusan and LeSean’s father. When LeSean opened the door to\naccept the money, the man, whom LeSean believed to be a\n  1\n    Except as noted, we base our recitation of the facts on the Arizona\nSupreme Court opinion upholding Robinson’s conviction and sentence on\ndirect appeal. See State v. Robinson, 796 P.2d 853 (Ariz. 1990).\n\f2718                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nblack man, attempted to grab him. LeSean escaped the man’s\ngrasp, fled the house, and ran to a neighbor’s house to call the\nsheriff.\n\n   As LeSean fled his house, two people entered the home.\nOne of these was later identified by Ralph as a black man\nwith a red bandana who was not Robinson. Ralph heard the\nintruders say that they were narcotics agents and that they\nwanted the drugs and the money. The intruders forced Ster-\nleen and Ralph to lie face-down on the floor of their bedroom\nand bound their hands and feet with electrical cords and neck-\nties. The intruders repeatedly asked where the money was and\nsearched through the bedroom closet and dresser. When Ster-\nleen asked that her feet be covered up, the Hills were both\nshot in the back with a shotgun. Ralph survived with severe\ninjuries, but Sterleen died. A girl who lived across the street\nheard what sounded like gunshots and then heard footsteps on\nthe gravel outside, muffled voices say “hurry up,” a car door\nslam, and a car driving away.\n\n   Shortly after the shootings, Deputy Koteles, who was\nresponding to LeSean’s emergency call, saw Robinson driv-\ning near the Hills’ house. When Robinson passed Koteles,\nRobinson smiled and accelerated as he passed. Robinson was\napprehended in his car shortly thereafter on a road near the\nHills’ home. Deputy Koteles found several bullets in Robin-\nson’s pants pockets. Mathers was apprehended the next day\nafter Susan Hill, who had heard about the shooting and was\non her way to Yuma after stopping in Banning, saw Mathers\nwalking along the road in the direction of Banning. Washing-\nton, who had called his girlfriend at 2:00 a.m. on June 9th to\ntell her that he was stranded in Yuma, was apprehended in\nBanning several days later.\n\n   Subsequent to the shootings, the police found several\npieces of evidence in the fields surrounding the Hill house,\nincluding Robinson’s shotgun, several spent and unspent shot-\ngun shells, a revolver cylinder, a bag containing several bul-\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                   2719\nlets, and a coat that appeared to belong to Washington. The\npolice also found evidence in Robinson’s car, including a box\nof shotgun shells, a red bandana (on which hairs probably\nbelonging to Mathers were found), and a piece of paper with\nthe Hills’ address on it, which had probably been written by\nRobinson.\n\n   In front of the Hills’ home, the police found footprints\nwhich they believed belonged to Robinson, although they did\nnot have a forensic expert evaluate the prints. There was no\nevidence, however, that Robinson had been inside the home.\nNo fingerprints of his were found inside the house, on the\nshotgun, or on any other items believed to have been used in\nthe shooting. Moreover, neither LeSean nor Ralph Hill identi-\nfied Robinson as having been one of the intruders, even\nthough Ralph knew Robinson and was shown a photo lineup\ncontaining Robinson’s photo.\n\n                        B.    The Trial\n\n                       1.    Guilt Phase\n\n  The three men were tried together. The prosecution’s the-\nory at trial was that Robinson had recruited Washington and\nMathers to go with him to Yuma to kidnap Susan Hill. The\nprosecution’s evidence established that Robinson had brought\nguns on his trip to Yuma, had been present in front of the\nHills’ house, and had driven away after the shooting. But the\nprosecution neither argued nor presented evidence that Robin-\nson entered the residence or participated in the actual shoot-\ning. In fact, Ralph specifically testified that the person he saw\nwas not Robinson. Additionally, the prosecution presented no\nevidence or argument that Robinson had instructed Washing-\nton and Mathers to kill the Hills, much less tell them how to\ndo so.\n\n  As further evidence of Robinson’s motive, the prosecution\npresented evidence of two other occasions on which Robinson\n\f2720                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nattempted to get Susan to return to him. The first time, in June\n1986, Susan was staying with her sister in North Hollywood,\nCalifornia. Two men entered the house one after the other,\nthreatened Susan’s sister and 11-year-old niece with hand-\nguns, and tied up their hands with stockings. Approximately\ntwo minutes later Robinson entered the house, by which time\nthe niece had already been untied. Robinson had the sister\ntake him to Susan, who was hiding in the bedroom closet.\nRobinson then cut the stockings off of the sister’s hands, told\nher to return to the living room, and spoke to Susan for about\nhalf an hour. During the conversation, Robinson tried to make\nSusan believe that he missed her and wanted her to come back\nto him, but he also told Susan that he had come with the inten-\ntion of killing her and her sister and that the only thing that\nstopped him was that Susan’s niece was there. The next day,\nSusan left with Robinson for Banning.\n\n   The second occasion was in January of 1987, after Susan\nwent to Philadelphia to stay with family without telling Rob-\ninson where she was going. When Robinson eventually\nlocated her, he went to Philadelphia with Mathers, lured\nSusan to him through a ruse, grabbed her, and took her back\nto Banning.\n\n  All three defendants were found guilty of first-degree mur-\nder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated\nassault, first-degree burglary, and armed robbery.\n\n                    2.   Sentencing Phase\n\n   The prosecution changed its theory of the case at sentenc-\ning. The new theory was that Sterleen died as a result of a\ndrug deal gone bad. Accordingly, the prosecution argued two\nstatutory aggravating circumstances: (1) the defendants com-\nmitted the offense in expectation of the receipt of something\nof pecuniary value, and (2) the defendants committed the\noffense in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner.\nAdditionally, the prosecution specifically argued that the pos-\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2721\nsibility that the conviction rested upon felony-murder was not\na mitigating circumstance in this case because there was no\ndoubt of the defendants’ specific intent to kill.\n\n   In his sentencing memorandum, Robinson’s attorney, Rob-\nert Roberson made several arguments. First, Roberson argued\nthat the Supreme Court’s opinions in Enmund v. Florida, 458\nU.S. 782 (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987),\ncounseled against sentencing Robinson to death because Rob-\ninson was not present at the scene of the killing and the prose-\ncution could not show beyond a reasonable doubt that\nRobinson intended to kill or acted with a reckless indifference\nto human life. Second, Roberson argued that the prosecution\ncould not prove the statutory aggravating circumstances\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Third, he argued that two statu-\ntory mitigating circumstances applied: (1) that Robinson was\na minor participant in the offense, and (2) that it was not rea-\nsonably foreseeable that Robinson’s conduct would cause or\ncreate a grave risk of death to another person. Finally, he\nbriefly argued that Robinson could not be sentenced to death\nbecause he was convicted under the felony murder rule.\nRoberson did not present any non-statutory mitigating factors\nin his sentencing memorandum.\n\n   The court held a single aggravation/mitigation hearing for\nthe three defendants. The prosecution presented several wit-\nnesses, including Major Ralph Ogden, chief deputy for the\nYuma County Sheriff’s office. Ogden testified about state-\nments made to him by Robinson’s co-defendant Washington\nafter the arrest, but the Arizona Supreme Court later deemed\nthis testimony inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause.\n\n   According to Ogden’s second-hand account, Robinson told\nWashington when they arrived in Yuma that they were going\nto “knock off a dope dealer, take his coke and take the cash.”\nHe also instructed them that after Washington and Mathers\nhad gone up to the house, Washington would knock on the\ndoor, and that when somebody opened it, the two men would\n\f2722                       ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nenter and “put the people down,” meaning “get them in chairs\nor whatever.” At that point, Robinson would enter because he\nknew where the cocaine and the money were located. Accord-\ning to Ogden, Washington told him that there was no specific\nplan to kill anybody, but that Mathers was to carry a shotgun\nand Robinson told his accomplices, “if things get rough, shoot\n‘em.”\n\n   Sergeant Roy Brock, also with the Yuma County Sheriff’s\noffice, testified at the sentencing phase about statements that\nRobinson had made to him after the murder. These statements\nindicated that the purpose of the trip to Yuma was to “rip off”\nsome drug dealers. But according to Robinson, Washington\nand Mathers drove to Yuma in a different car and went to the\nwrong house, where they proceeded to commit the crime.2\n\n   Roberson cross-examined the state’s witnesses, but did not\ncall any of his own. In his closing argument, Roberson again\nfocused on the aggravating factors and urged the court to find\nthat the county had not proved the aggravating factors beyond\na reasonable doubt. With respect to mitigation, Roberson\nrelied on his sentencing memorandum, making only a brief\nargument that Robinson “[didn’t] have a history of harming\npeople” and was “a good father apparently.”3 Altogether,\n  2\n     The county also called Dr. Bruce Shirer, a pathologist who performed\nthe autopsy on Sterleen Hill and had testified at trial. Shirer testified that\nthere was no evidence of head trauma that would indicate that Sterleen had\nbeen knocked unconscious; on cross-examination he acknowledged that it\nwas nevertheless possible that she was knocked unconscious shortly\nbefore being shot. Ralph Hill testified at the aggravation/mitigation hear-\ning, but his testimony was directed only toward sentencing for the non-\ncapital offenses for which the defendants were convicted.\n   3\n     The following is the full extent of Roberson’s closing argument on mit-\nigation:\n      I can cite a whole lot of mitigating factors as far as Fred is con-\n      cerned. I can cite a couple that may have a little bearing. Fred,\n      at least as far as the evidence we have received in court, doesn’t\n      have a history of harming people. He may have a history, as\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                        2723\nRoberson’s closing argument consisted of just over ten pages\nof double-spaced transcript.\n\n   The court sentenced Robinson to death.4 The sentencing\njudge found three statutory aggravating factors justifying the\nsentence: (1) Robinson procured the commission of the\noffense by the payment or promise of receipt of something of\npecuniary value by the other defendants; (2) Robinson com-\nmitted the offense for the purpose of receipt of something of\nmonetary value; and (3) Robinson committed the offense in\nan especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner. With\nrespect to mitigating circumstances the court found that (1)\nRobinson’s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law\nwas not impaired; (2) Robinson was not under duress; (3)\nRobinson was not a minor participant in the crime; (4) it was\nreasonably foreseeable that the offense would create a grave\nrisk of death; (5) Robinson’s age (46 at the time of the mur-\n\n      shown by the evidence, of going after Susan and being involved\n      in some shenanigans that way, but he never hurt anybody as far\n      as we know by the testimony. He is a good father apparently. He\n      has — I don’t remember what the testimony is — 9, 12, 15 kids\n      or something by several different women. He apparently has cus-\n      tody of almost all of them. Even Susan had to testify Fred was\n      a good father. The kids loved him. They were taken care of, fed,\n      clothed, sent off to go to school. The kids testified about having\n      to go to school, getting homework done. They had newspaper\n      routes. I don’t think we can show Fred is some kind of ogre who\n      is a total — and has no redeeming value. I think from the fact he\n      was able to raise, from what I could see from testimony, 2 pretty\n      good kids and presumably the other children just as well as those\n      2. He is able to care for them. He is able to. They love him. I\n      think that’s a little mitigation for him.\n   4\n     Under Arizona law at the time of Robinson’s sentencing, the trial\njudge, not the jury, determined whether aggravating circumstances\napplied. Although the Supreme Court invalidated this sentencing scheme\nin Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), Ring does not apply retroactively\nto cases on collateral review. Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 358\n(2004).\n\f2724                     ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nders) was not a mitigating factor; and (6) “no other mitigating\ncircumstances were presented by the defendant for consider-\nation.” Because the trial court found at least one statutory\naggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances, it\nwas bound under then-existing Arizona law to apply the death\npenalty. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-703(E) (1988) (current ver-\nsion at Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-751).\n\n C.    State Appeals and Federal Habeas Corpus Review\n\n                         1.   Direct Appeal\n\n   All three defendants appealed their convictions and sen-\ntences. The Arizona Supreme Court vacated Mathers’s con-\nviction, State v. Mathers, 796 P.2d 866 (Ariz. 1990), but\nupheld the convictions of Robinson and Washington, State v.\nRobinson, 796 P.2d 853 (Ariz. 1990). Before the Arizona\nSupreme Court, Robinson argued that various evidentiary rul-\nings in the trial court were in error and that his sentence\nshould be vacated because “(1) the killing was not committed\nfor pecuniary gain, (2) the killing was neither depraved nor\nheinous, nor was it cruel, and (3) a further hearing was\nrequired regarding the presence of Tison and Enmund consid-\nerations.” Id. at 858. Although it upheld Robinson’s sentence,\nthe court held that only two of the three aggravating circum-\nstances found by the sentencing court were supported by the\nevidence. Id. at 861-63. The court held that the testimony of\nMajor Ogden as to the statements made to him by Washington\nwas inadmissible because it violated Robinson’s Sixth\nAmendment right to confront a witness against him. Id. at\n861-62. As a result, the court set aside as insufficiently sup-\nported the sentencing court’s finding that Robinson commit-\nted the murder in expectation of something of pecuniary\nvalue. Id. at 862. As for mitigating circumstances, the court\nstated, “Robinson offered no mitigating circumstances and we\nagree with the trial court that none exist.”5 Id. at 863. As a\n  5\n    As explained above, Robinson’s counsel did in fact argue very briefly\nfor two statutory mitigating circumstances and two nonstatutory mitigating\n\f                       ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                     2725\nresult, the court held that “no mitigating circumstances exist\nso as to warrant vacating . . . Robinson’s . . . death sen-\ntence[ ].” Id. at 864. The court also concluded that “imposi-\ntion of the death penalty in the present case is proportional to\nthe sentences imposed in similar cases,” and that the district\ncourt did not commit fundamental error. Id. at 865.\n\n       2.   State Post-Conviction Relief Proceedings\n\n   Robinson then brought a petition for post-conviction relief\nin Arizona state court, making the same arguments that he\nmade on direct appeal and adding a claim for ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The same superior court judge who pre-\nsided over Robinson’s trial also presided over Robinson’s\npost-conviction proceedings. The court conducted an eviden-\ntiary hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nThe court heard testimony from Juan Gonzales, a corrections\nparole officer; Robert Roberson, Robinson’s trial counsel; and\nDr. Tod Roy, a psychologist who examined Robinson in prep-\naration for the evidentiary hearing.\n\n                          a.   Gonzales\n\n   Gonzales’s testimony focused on Robinson’s good behav-\nior in prison. Gonzales testified that Robinson had frequent\ncontact with members of his family, both by mail and by tele-\nphone. Gonzales also testified that Robinson had only two\nminor disciplinary problems in four years and was classified\nas Level Five-One, the lowest security level possible for a\ndeath row inmate, “which means . . . they do what they are\ntold and never get in trouble.” Gonzales testified that Robin-\nson was an insulin-dependent diabetic and that he got along\nwell with other inmates, went to church regularly, and had\n\ncircumstances. That the Arizona Supreme Court wrongly believed that\nRobinson had offered no mitigating circumstances accentuates only the\nfeebleness and brevity of counsel’s effort.\n\f2726                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nadjusted well to life in prison. Gonzales believed that Robin-\nson would do well if he were placed in the general prison pop-\nulation.\n\n                             b.   Roberson\n\n   Roberson testified about his educational and professional\nbackground and about his preparation for the guilt and penalty\nphases of the trial. At the time of the evidentiary hearing, he\nhad been practicing for about twenty years, splitting his time\nmore or less equally between criminal and civil work, and\nthought, although he was not sure, that he had tried at least\none death penalty case prior to Robinson’s. He explained that\nafter being assigned to Robinson’s case, he stopped taking\nnew civil matters so that he would have more time for Robin-\nson. He did not apply for funds for a private investigator, not-\ning that “back during those days we were all doing pretty\nmuch our own investigation.”6 Likewise, he did not hire medi-\ncal or mental health experts, stating that he never observed\nany mental deficiencies, that Robinson never “gave [him] any\nindication that there was some mental problem that he might\nlike to explore,” and that he never got “any inkling” that there\nwas “any kind of a mental problem or psychological explana-\ntion . . . that might have led to Fred’s involvement in this\ncase.”\n\n   Turning specifically to the penalty phase, Roberson\nacknowledged that any type of mitigating evidence could be\npresented at sentencing, not just the five statutory circum-\nstances, and that the nonstatutory factors included potential\nfor rehabilitation, remorse, and family ties. He also acknowl-\nedged that the full extent of his investigation was talking to\nRobinson, and he explained that he did not feel that he could\npresent evidence of remorse or family ties because Robinson\ninsisted he was innocent and two of his sons had testified\n  6\n   The court agreed that “it was rather rare for the court either to hear or\ngrant a request for outside investigators.”\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2727\nagainst him. He acknowledged that he did not subpoena\nschool, medical, mental, or employment records for Robin-\nson, but did not provide any explanation for why he did not\ndo so. He acknowledged that in hindsight he should have con-\nsulted a psychologist or psychiatrist, but said that at the time\nhe did not think it was necessary based on what Robinson had\ntold him. Finally, he acknowledged that he did not call any\nwitnesses on Robinson’s behalf.\n\n                           c.   Roy\n\n  Dr. Roy testified as to the results of his psychological eval-\nuation of Robinson. In preparing his report, Roy conducted\nfourteen hours of face-to-face interviews and testing with\nRobinson and interviewed Robinson’s father.\n\n   Roy described a “number of experiences in [Robinson’s]\ndevelopment that I think contributed to how he viewed peo-\nple[, e]specially in close relationships.” These included\nrepeated childhood sexual abuse, the repudiation of Robin-\nson’s siblings by his father, and physical and emotional abuse\nby his father and stepmother.\n\n   According to Roy’s report, Robinson was born and spent\nhis formative years in a poor, segregated rural community in\nTexas. He described his childhood as close knit until his par-\nents separated when he was nine or ten. His parents’ divorce\nwas particularly difficult for Robinson because his father\nrejected the younger children in open court and the children\nwere separated. Robinson and the older siblings went to live\nwith his father, and the younger siblings stayed with his\nmother.\n\n   Shortly after the divorce, Robinson’s father remarried. His\nnew stepmother had five children of her own and they all\nlived in a very small house. Robinson felt that he and his bio-\nlogical siblings were treated worse than his step-siblings; for\nexample, the step-siblings ate meals first and Robinson and\n\f2728                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nhis siblings ate the leftovers. Robinson reported being beaten\nwith a switch or a belt approximately every other day for\nminor infractions reported by his stepmother. Things\nimproved when the family moved to a larger house, although\nthere was still conflict. In particular, when Robinson was in\nhigh school he worked to save money for a car; not twenty-\nfour hours after he purchased it, his father told him that he\nand Robinson’s stepmother had decided that Robinson would\nhave to give his car to an older stepbrother who in their esti-\nmation needed it more because he was going to college. Rob-\ninson continues to resent his father for doing this, although he\nsays he forgave him.\n\n   Robinson also experienced several incidents of sexual\nabuse. First, his stepmother’s boyfriend sodomized him at\nknifepoint and threatened him with death if he told anyone.\nSecond, when he was about nine years old, he witnessed his\nsister being raped by a white man. Finally, as a young boy he\nhad an aunt who repeatedly performed oral sex on him and\nforced him to do the same to her. Dr. Roy remarked at the evi-\ndentiary hearing that Robinson “was tearful and very reluctant\nto talk about [the rape]. And it was my impression that I was\nthe first person to whom he had disclosed that.” Roy\ndescribed the significance of this type of incident to a child:\n\n    It’s significant because — especially a rape of that\n    nature — it brings very quickly to one’s awareness\n    how powerless one is over the power of someone\n    else, for one. And I believe his life was threatened if\n    he told anyone. One’s achievement, one’s desire to\n    do things can be robbed when arbitrarily they are\n    taken from us, and for reasons that aren’t reasonable\n    and questionable entitlement. That would leave an\n    individual with — who was somewhat confused, in\n    terms of what to expect. It would also create a sense\n    of dependency on these people, because they are the\n    ones that have the power, and that power sometimes\n    is utilized in inappropriate ways.\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                        2729\n   At the time of his conviction, Robinson had been unem-\nployed and receiving disability benefits for approximately\nseven years. He became disabled as a result of a motorcycle\naccident which left him with a pronounced limp. Robinson\nalso claimed that he suffered a head injury as a result of the\naccident, but according to Roy, Robinson’s medical records\nafter his accident “did not report any disturbances that would\nsuggest organic brain damage.”\n\n   Robinson has a very large family. In addition to seventeen\nsiblings, he reported having fifteen children of his own with\nfive different women. Several of these relationships ended or\nhad problems because the women were cheating on him.\n\n   Robinson claims never to have used drugs. At the time of\nhis conviction, he had numerous health problems, including\ndiabetes, high-blood pressure, a broken hip, and poor vision.\nHe had never been evaluated or treated by a mental health\ncare provider until his post-conviction relief evaluation.\n\n   Roy diagnosed Robinson with Adjustment Disorder with\nAnxious Mood (Axis I) and Borderline Personality Disorder\nwith Dependent Features (Axis II), a character disorder that\nleads to a pattern of unstable relationships because of the psy-\nchological defense mechanisms of its sufferers. Roy con-\ncluded in his report that Robinson’s character disorder\nresulted from his caretakers’ disregard for him and his efforts.7\n\n   At the hearing, Roy testified that Robinson “had the poten-\ntial to be rehabilitated,” although there were concerns about\nthe likelihood in light of his age and disability. He also stated\nthat there was a “lack of . . . data to support a hostility\ntowards people.” He found that Robinson had low intelli-\ngence, scoring an I.Q. of 81,8 which is at the tenth percentile\n   7\n     This diagnosis was challenged by the state’s expert, Dr. Eva McCul-\nlars, who based her contrary diagnosis of Anti-Social Personality Disorder\non her review of Roy’s report and a brief interview with Robinson.\n   8\n     An I.Q. of 75 is considered mentally retarded.\n\f2730                 ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nof adults, meaning his intelligence “would be exceeded by\nninety percent of the adult population of this country.” Dr.\nRoy also stated that he did not believe that Robinson had a\npredisposition or propensity towards violence, and that there\nwas no risk of recividism, although he said that he would rec-\nommend Susan stay away from him, because this crime\n“seems to be strictly related to the dynamics in that relation-\nship [with Susan Hill] in his own psychology.”\n\n   The court ultimately denied Robinson’s petition in its\nentirety. With regard to Robinson’s challenge to the applica-\ntion of the especially cruel, heinous, or depraved conduct\naggravator, the court stated that “[n]othing has been presented\nhere except a reiteration of the sentencing proceedings and\nfindings of this court which were later reviewed and upheld\non appeal,” which did not “present a colorable claim.”\n\n   The court was similarly unconvinced regarding Robinson’s\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found\nthat Roberson was not ineffective at sentencing because (1)\n“[i]t was pretty much apparent that the defendant’s family\nwas not going to be the source of much mitigating testimony”;\n(2) evidence that Robinson was “a good and caring father”\nwas balanced by evidence of Robinson’s “aggressive and\ntyrannically possessive attitude concerning his ‘family,’ ”\nincluding Susan Hill; and (3) there was no evidence that Rob-\ninson was “a minor player in the crime[.]” The court also\nfound that Roberson was not ineffective in failing to request\na psychological evaluation. The court accepted as true the\nfinding that Robinson had “an antisocial personality disorder\nand was poorly adjusted to living in society,” but found that\nthere was nothing which would have “lessened his ability to\ndifferentiate right from wrong or to conform his actions with\nthe law” at the time the murder was committed. The court also\nnoted that there was nothing that would have suggested to\nRoberson that a mental examination would be helpful to Rob-\ninson. The court concluded that the results of Dr. Roy’s exam-\nination would not have “altered the sentence imposed.”\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                         2731\nFinally, the court rejected all of Robinson’s claims of mitigat-\ning circumstances.\n\n  The Arizona Supreme Court subsequently denied Robin-\nson’s petition for review without opinion.9\n\n                  3.     Federal Habeas Corpus\n\n   Robinson filed a preliminary habeas petition on March 14,\n1996, in which he requested relief on ten grounds and sought\nappointment of counsel. Counsel was appointed and on May\n6, 1997 an amended petition was filed. Robinson’s amended\npetition made nine claims for relief: (1) ineffective assistance\nof counsel based on his attorney’s conflict of interest; (2) a\ndue process violation based on the trial court’s refusal to give\na requested lesser included offense instruction; (3) the “pro-\ncurement for pecuniary gain” aggravating circumstance was\nunconstitutionally vague; (4) the prosecution’s inconsistent\nmotive theories violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights;\n(5) a violation of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights because the Arizona Supreme Court failed to conduct\na harmless error analysis or re-weigh aggravating and mitigat-\ning circumstances; (6) the application of the “especially hei-\nnous, cruel or depraved” aggravating circumstance to facts of\nthis case violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; (7)\na violation of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights\nbecause there was insufficient evidence that he killed,\nattempted to kill, or intended to kill; (8) ineffective assistance\nof counsel at sentencing; and (9) Arizona’s execution statute\nviolated the ex post facto clause and the Fourteenth and\nEighth Amendments.\n\n   On August 8, 1999, the district court issued an order dis-\n  9\n    Robinson filed a Second Petition for Post Conviction Relief in Arizona\nSuperior Court on February 10, 1998. The state trial court denied the peti-\ntion and the Arizona Supreme Court denied the petition for review. Robin-\nson’s second petition is not at issue in this appeal.\n\f2732                    ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nmissing Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-A as procedurally barred and\nClaim 9 as withdrawn, and ordering briefing on the merits of\nthe remaining issues. On March 17, 2005, the district court\ndenied relief concluding that Claim 5 was procedurally barred\nand that Claims 6-B, 6-C, 7 and 8 lack merit. The court also\nconcluded that Robinson was not entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing in district court on ineffective assistance of counsel.\nThe district court granted a certificate of appealability on\nClaims 6-A, 6-B, 6-C, and 8. We subsequently granted a cer-\ntificate of appealability on Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n                  II.    Standard of Review\n\n   We review the district court’s denial of Robinson’s habeas\npetition de novo, and the district court’s findings of fact for\nclear error. See Rios v. Rocha, 299 F.3d 796, 799 n.4 (9th Cir.\n2002). Because Robinson’s federal habeas petition was filed\nbefore the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”), Pub. L. No. 104-132,\n110 Stat. 1214, pre-AEDPA law governs our consideration of\nthe merits. Correll v. Ryan, 539 F.3d 938, 941-42 (9th Cir.\n2008) (citing Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 327 (1997)),\ncert. denied sub nom. Schriro v. Correll, 129 S. Ct. 903\n(2009); Jeffries v. Wood, 114 F.3d 1484, 1494 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(en banc). Under pre-AEDPA law, we owe no deference to\nthe state court’s resolution of questions of law or mixed ques-\ntions of law and fact. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,\n400 (2000). Whether Robinson’s trial counsel was ineffective\nis a mixed question of law and fact reviewed de novo. Sum-\nmerlin v. Schriro, 427 F.3d 623, 628 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc)\n(citing Rios, 299 F.3d at 799 n.4). We review the district\ncourt’s findings of fact for clear error. Lambright v. Schriro,\n490 F.3d 1103, 1114 (9th Cir. 2007) (per curiam), cert.\ndenied, 128 S. Ct. 882 (2008). Dismissals based on procedural\ndefault are reviewed de novo. Vang v. Nevada, 329 F.3d\n1069, 1072 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\f                        ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                     2733\n                         III.   Discussion\n\n   In this opinion, we consider whether the Arizona state\ncourts arbitrarily and capriciously applied the aggravating cir-\ncumstance of especially cruel, heinous or depraved conduct to\nRobinson and whether Robinson received ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel at sentencing. Because we decide both issues\nin Robinson’s favor, we reverse the district court.\n\n  A.     Claim 6: Especially Cruel, Heinous, or Depraved\n                    Aggravating Factor\n\n   In his federal habeas petition, Robinson argued that the\nespecially cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravating factor,\nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 13-703(F)(6) (1988), was unconstitutional\nas applied to him. The district court divided this claim into\nthree parts:\n\n       (A) Insufficient evidence that Petitioner intended or\n       reasonably foresaw the victim’s suffering resulted in\n       an arbitrary cruelty finding in violation of Petition-\n       er’s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-\n       ments;\n\n       (B) Insufficient evidence of Petitioner’s involvement\n       in the crime resulted in an arbitrary hei-\n       nous/depraved finding in violation of Petitioner’s\n       rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments;\n\n       (C) The (F)(6) aggravating factor, as applied to Peti-\n       tioners case, failed to sufficiently channel the sen-\n       tencer’s discretion in violation of the Eighth and\n       Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe district court rejected claim 6-A as procedurally\ndefaulted. Following briefing on the merits of the remaining\nclaims, the district court concluded that sufficient evidence\nsupported the state courts’ findings that the murder was sense-\n\f2734                     ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nless and the victim helpless, and as a result, that the depravity\nprong of the aggravating factor properly applied to this case.\nBut the court went on to note that even if the depravity find-\ning was unconstitutional, the error was harmless because the\nstate courts’ cruelty finding was sufficiently supported by the\nevidence to apply the aggravating factor to Robinson. The\ncourt also denied Claim 6-C on the merits. We hold that both\nClaims 6-A and 6-B were adequately exhausted and entitle\nRobinson to relief. As we hold that the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved aggravating factor was unconstitutionally\napplied to Robinson pursuant to Claims 6-A and 6-B, we do\nnot reach Claim 6-C.\n\n                        1.    Procedural Bar\n\n   [1] The procedural bar doctrine is a subcategory of the\nindependent and adequate state ground doctrine. See Boyd v.\nThompson, 147 F.3d 1124, 1126 (9th Cir. 1998). The purpose\nof the doctrine is to protect the state’s interests by giving it the\nopportunity to correct its own errors. See Coleman v. Thomp-\nson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991). Under this doctrine, a federal\ncourt ordinarily will not review a state court ruling if the state\ncourt would find that the claim was barred pursuant to an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rule.10 Id.\n\n   We recognize two types of procedural bars: express and\nimplied. An express procedural bar occurs when the petitioner\nhas presented his claim to the state courts and the state courts\nhave relied on a state procedural rule to deny or dismiss the\nclaim. An implied procedural bar, on the other hand, occurs\nwhen the petitioner has failed to fairly present his claims to\nthe highest state court and would now be barred by a state\n  10\n    The federal court, however, will review the claim if the petitioner can\nshow either cause and prejudice, see Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750, or a fun-\ndamental miscarriage of justice, see Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 495\n(1986), or if the government waived the procedural default, see Franklin\nv. Johnson, 290 F.3d 1223, 1230, 1233 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\f                          ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                         2735\nprocedural rule from doing so. See, e.g., Beaty v. Stewart, 303\nF.3d 975, 987 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n   The district court concluded that Claim 6-A was subject to\nan implied procedural bar because it was substantially differ-\nent from the cruelty issue raised on direct appeal, and Arizona\nRule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(a)(3) would prohibit Robin-\nson from returning to state court to exhaust the claim. We dis-\nagree with the district court’s conclusion that Claim 6-A was\nnot exhausted in Robinson’s direct appeal of his conviction to\nthe Arizona Supreme Court and conclude, as a result, that no\nimplied procedural bar applies.\n\n   [2] In order to exhaust his claim, Robinson was required to\npresent both the factual and legal basis for the claim to the\nstate court. Weaver v. Thompson, 197 F.3d 359, 364 (9th Cir.\n1999); see also Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 162-63\n(1996). To do so, Robinson was required to reference specific\nprovisions of the federal constitution or cite to federal case\nlaw and to provide a statement of the facts that entitle him to\nrelief. Gray, 518 U.S. at 162-63; Lyons v. Crawford, 232 F.3d\n666, 668, 670 (9th Cir. 2000), amended, 247 F.3d 904 (9th\nCir. 2001).\n\n   In the Opening Brief he filed on direct appeal of his convic-\ntion to the Arizona Supreme Court, Robinson argued that “the\nimposition of the death penalty was in violation . . . of the\nConstitution of the United States” because the especially\ncruel, heinous, or depraved aggravating factor was applied in\nan arbitrary manner. In support of his position, Robinson cited\nJeffers v. Ricketts, 832 F.2d 476 (9th Cir. 1987), rev’d sub\nnom. Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764 (1990).11 In Jeffers, we\n  11\n     The fact that the Supreme Court later held that the aggravating cir-\ncumstance was not applied in violation of Jeffers’ constitutional rights,\nJeffers, 497 U.S. 764, does not change the analysis. The citation to Jeffers\nis relevant to this discussion because it put the state court on notice that\nRobinson was arguing that his sentence violated the federal constitution.\nMoreover, at the time Robinson’s appeal was decided, the Ninth Circuit\nopinion in Jeffers had not yet been overruled.\n\f2736                       ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nheld that the especially cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravat-\ning factor was applied arbitrarily to Jeffers, in violation of the\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments, because there was no\nprincipled way to distinguish Jeffers’s conduct from that in\nother cases where the Arizona courts had found that the\nbehavior at issue was not especially heinous or depraved.12 Id.\nat 483-85. In addition, Robinson argued that the murder was\nnot especially cruel because it did not involve “the senseless\nor sadistic infliction of great pain” and pointed out that he was\nnot in the house and did not participate in the actual shooting.13\n\n   The district court erred by concluding that, in his direct\nappeal of his conviction to the Arizona Supreme Court, Rob-\ninson did not fairly present a claim based on lack of intent or\nforeseeability. Robinson argued that “the finding that his acts\nconstituted especially cruel, heinous and depraved activity is\nunconstitutional,” citing to Jeffers in support. Two pages\nlater, he again asserted that “the imposition of the death pen-\nalty in this case was arbitrary and capricious and, therefore,\nunconstitutional.” As part of this same discussion in his brief,\nhe also fairly presented the factual basis for his claim, stress-\ning that “[he] was not even in the house and had no part in\nthe actual shooting.” Earlier in his brief, while arguing against\napplication of especially cruel, heinous, or depraved factor, he\n  12\n      The Arizona Supreme Court had previously held that Jeffers did not\ncommit the murder in an especially cruel manner. Jeffers, 832 F.2d at 483.\n   13\n      Robinson’s briefing in the direct appeal of his conviction to the Ari-\nzona Supreme Court argued that application of the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved factor was unconstitutional because (1) there was no\nevidence that Sterleen Hill suffered, and (2) there was no evidence Robin-\nson participated in the murders. It is specious to assert, as the dissent does,\nthat Robinson now agrees that Mrs. Hill suffered sufficiently to support a\ncruelty finding. Further, Robinson’s two arguments against application of\nthe especially cruel, heinous, or depraved factor are independent of each\nother. Even if Robinson had abandoned the first argument about Mrs.\nHill’s suffering we fail to see why — as the dissent seems to suggest —\nabandoning that argument would mean that he never made the second\nargument about his participation.\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                         2737\nhad already “noted that [he] did not participate in the killing,\ndid not intend anyone to die,” and “was not involved directly\nwith the shooting.” These arguments clearly exhausted the\nfederal claim.\n\n   Robinson was not required to present his arguments in the\nsame amount of detail to the two courts in support of his fed-\neral constitutional claim; he was required only to present to\nthe state court the legal and factual basis of his federal consti-\ntutional claim. Robinson clearly raised the constitutional issue\nby citing to a federal case that held that the application of the\nespecially cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravating factor to\nthe petitioner violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments of the U.S. Constitution. He also specifically noted his\nlack of participation in the shooting in support of his claim.\nHe thus presented the same claim he does now — that, given\nhis lack of participation in the murder, a finding of especial\ncruelty, heinousness and depravity violated his rights.\n\n   It does not matter that Robinson now cites an intervening\ncase, State v. Carlson, 48 P.3d 1180 (Ariz. 2002), for the spe-\ncific holding that the cruelty prong of the “especially cruel,\nheinous, or depraved” factor may not be applied to a defen-\ndant absent intent or reasonable foreseeability. Carlson post-\ndates both Robinson’s direct appeal and his amended federal\nhabeas petition, so he could not have cited it. More impor-\ntantly, Robinson’s state-court argument was that the “espe-\ncially cruel, heinous, or depraved” factor as a whole could not\nbe constitutionally applied to him because there was no evi-\ndence of intent or reasonable foreseeability. His argument,\ntherefore, encompassed the rule that the Arizona Supreme\nCourt specifically adopted in Carlson.14\n  14\n     The dissent distorts the argument Robinson made in his briefing on\ndirect appeal of his conviction to the Arizona Supreme Court. There he\narticulated the “especially cruel, heinous, or depraved” factor as a single\nfactor under Arizona law (as of course it is).\n\f2738                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\n   [3] This is not a case where the petitioner failed to make\nclear that he was invoking a federal right, see, e.g., Anderson\nv. Harless, 459 U.S. 4, 6 (1982) (per curiam), or where the\npetitioner’s “general appeal to a constitutional guarantee” was\ntoo vague to put the state court on notice of the federal claim,\ncf. Shumway v. Payne, 223 F.3d 982, 988 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(holding that mere reference to “due process” and citation to\na state law case that referenced the federal constitution for a\nproposition other than that for which the case was cited to the\n\n   The dissent strains to impose a rigid separation on the arguments in\nRobinson’s Arizona Supreme Court briefing, insisting that every time\nRobinson argued his lack of participation and intent, he intended it to\nrelate only to the heinousness and depravity prongs of the factor but not\nto the cruelty prong. This interpretation is untenable. The two prongs are\ndiscussed together, in a section of Robinson’s brief headed “Factor 6 of\nA.R.S. 12-703F.” Though Robinson makes one argument — regarding the\nextent of the suffering of the victims — that is directed to the cruelty\nprong only, he ends this section of the brief with a final “not[e]” about\nRobinson’s lack of participation or intent, concluding that paragraph with\nthe statement, “Neither the conduct of the others involved, much less\nAppellant Robinson’s, prove this factor beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Emphasis added.) In the next section of the brief, in the course of discuss-\ning two relevant Supreme Court decisions, Robinson expanded on the\nfacts demonstrating lack of intent and foreseeability. Contrary to the dis-\nsent’s suggestion, the fair reading of the state court briefing is that Robin-\nson argued that the “especially cruel, heinous, and depraved” factor as a\nwhole was unconstitutionally applied in light of Robinson’s lack of partici-\npation in the killings.\n   That Robinson’s current arguments elaborate on those made in state\ncourt does not make his state-court presentation insufficient for purposes\nof exhaustion. In concluding otherwise, the dissent ignores governing law\nand substitutes an exhaustion standard that is wholly unsupported in the\ncase law. It fails to understand that as long as the “ultimate question for\ndisposition” has remained the same in state and federal court, as it has\nhere, “variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its sup-\nport” are entirely legitimate. Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 277 (1971)\n(quotation marks and citation omitted); accord Lopez v. Schriro, 491 F.3d\n1029, 1040 (9th Cir. 2007); McKinney v. Artuz, 326 F.3d 87, 97 (2d Cir.\n2003); Boyko v. Parke, 259 F.3d 781, 788-89 (7th Cir. 2001); Weaver v.\nThompson, 197 F.3d 359, 364-65 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                   2739\nstate court was insufficient to put the state court on notice of\nthe federal claim). Robinson alleged violation of a narrow and\nspecific constitutional guarantee — the right to be free from\nthe arbitrary application of an aggravating factor, leading to\nthe arbitrary imposition of the death penalty — and cited a\nfederal court case, Jeffers, that held that right was violated\nbecause of the way in which the especially cruel, heinous, or\ndepraved factor was applied to the petitioner in that case. He\nalso alleged the factual basis for the claim: the manner of the\nmurder and specifically his lack of participation in the shoot-\ning. This combination was sufficient to present the bases of\nhis federal claim to the state court. Accordingly, we hold that\nRobinson exhausted the claim in state court.\n\n   [4] Because Robinson exhausted this claim in the state\ncourt, federal court review is barred only if the Arizona\nSupreme Court relied on a violation of a state procedural rule\nin rejecting the claim. See Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 261-\n62 (1989). In this case, the state supreme court, on direct\nappeal, rejected the claim on the merits. State v. Robinson,\n796 F.2d at 858. Accordingly, we are not procedurally barred\nfrom reviewing Robinson’s claim. Cf. Vasquez v. Hillery, 474\nU.S. 254, 260 (1986) (addressing merits of claim after deter-\nmining that additional facts did not change substance of claim\naddressed by California Supreme Court).\n\n             2.   Merits of Claims 6-A and 6-B\n\n   Robinson asserts that insufficient evidence supported the\nArizona Supreme Court’s application of the especially cruel,\nheinous, or depraved aggravating factor. To be applied to a\ndefendant, an aggravating factor must be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Summerlin, 427 F.3d at 642. Federal habeas\ncorpus relief does not lie for mere errors of state law, but only\nfor federal constitutional violations. Jeffers, 497 U.S. at 780.\nTherefore, to grant habeas relief on an insufficient evidence\nclaim we must conclude that the sentencing court’s finding\nthat the murder was committed in an especially heinous,\n\f2740                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\ncruel, or depraved manner beyond a reasonable doubt was not\nonly erroneous, but “was so arbitrary or capricious as to con-\nstitute an independent due process or Eighth Amendment vio-\nlation.” Id. In making such a determination, the applicable\nstandard of review is that of the “rational factfinder.” Id. at\n781; see also Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, 80 F.3d 1301, 1307\n(9th Cir. 1996). This means that “[a] state court’s finding of\nan aggravating circumstance in a particular case — including\na de novo finding by an appellate court that a particular\noffense is ‘especially heinous . . . or depraved’ — is arbitrary\nor capricious if and only if no reasonable sentencer could\nhave so concluded.” Jeffers, 497 U.S. at 783. Furthermore, as\nthe especially heinous, cruel, or depraved factor is framed in\nthe disjunctive, we must individually determine that the sen-\ntencing court’s finding of both cruelty and heinousness and\ndepravity were arbitrary to find that the application of the fac-\ntor constituted a constitutional violation. See State v. Gretzler,\n659 P.2d 1, 10 (Ariz. 1983).\n\n   [5] The cruelty prong of the aggravating factor “relates to\nthe physical and mental suffering of the victim during the\nmurder.” State v. Carlson, 48 P.3d 1180, 1191 (Ariz. 2002).\nBy contrast, “heinousness and depravity focus on the mental\nstate of the defendant.” Id. Robinson’s challenges to applica-\ntion of both the cruelty and the heinousness and depravity\nprongs fundamentally run parallel. At bottom, Robinson\nasserts that the state courts’ application of both prongs of this\nfactor was arbitrary because there is no admissible evidence\nthat Robinson was present at, intended, or reasonably foresaw\nthe murders. We agree. Applying the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved factor to Robinson based on the manner of\na murder he neither intended, was present for, nor anticipated\nwith reasonable certainty, is an application of Arizona law so\narbitrary as to constitute an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\n   [6] Our review of the record reveals no admissible evi-\ndence or argument placing Robinson inside the Hills’ home at\nthe time of the murder or evidence tending to prove that Rob-\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                        2741\ninson ordered the murder of the Hills. The prosecution never\nargued, nor was any evidence presented, that Robinson\nentered the Hills’ home and was present for, let alone person-\nally performed, the murder. The evidence shows, and the\nprosecution argued, only that Robinson drove Mathers and\nWashington with firearms to the Hills’ home and was present\noutside the residence when the murder occurred. Nor was any\nadmissible evidence presented that Robinson ordered the\ntying up or murder of the Hills. Major Ogden’s statements\nsupporting such a conclusion were deemed inadmissable by\nthe Arizona Supreme Court. Although there was evidence that\na year earlier Robinson had entered Susan’s sister’s house in\nsearch of Susan after two of Robinson’s associates had first\nentered the house with guns and tied up Susan’s sister and\nniece, Robinson did not harm anyone on that occasion and\nthere was no evidence that Robinson had instructed his asso-\nciates to tie up Susan’s sister and niece. Hence, the total evi-\ndence here at most indicates that Robinson formulated and\ninitiated a plan to have Mathers and Washington invade the\nHills’ home to locate Susan or drugs, not any plan to bind and\nmurder the Hills.\n\n   [7] The Arizona Supreme Court’s findings on appeal\nreflect the lack of evidence of Robinson’s presence at or\nordering of the murder. While it found Washington “was at\nleast present in the Hills’ home” when the murder occurred,\nit found only that Robinson “loaded firearms into his vehicle\nin preparation for the trip” and “masterminded the trip.” Rob-\ninson, 796 P.2d at 864.15 The court, however, did not make\n  15\n    We note that, although the jury found Robinson guilty of first degree\nmurder, attempted first degree murder, burglary in the first degree, armed\nrobbery, aggravated assault causing serious physical injury, and aggra-\nvated assault using a deadly weapon, this verdict did not require the jury\nto find that Robinson entered the Hills’ home. The jury was instructed\nboth as to felony murder and accomplice liability and found both Mathers\nand Washington guilty of the same offenses. Either a felony murder or\naccomplice theory allowed the jury to impute guilt to Robinson through\nthe actions of Mathers and Washington.\n\f2742                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nany specific finding that Robinson ordered the binding or kill-\ning of the Hills. Despite the lack of findings on these critical\npoints, the court relied on the specific manner in which Sterl-\neen’s murder was carried out to uphold the especially cruel\nand heinous or depraved aggravating factor. This was an arbi-\ntrary application of state law.\n\n   [8] “There is no vicarious liability for cruelty in capital\ncases absent a plan intended or reasonably certain to cause\nsuffering. The plan must be such that suffering before death\nmust be inherently and reasonably certain to occur, not just an\nuntoward event.” Carlson, 48 P.3d at 1193. To apply “[m]ere\nforeseeability as a benchmark for death in capital cases would\nnot permit the aggravators to serve their constitutional pur-\npose of narrowing the class of first-degree murderers who can\nbe sentenced to death.” Id. at 1192.16 In holding that Ster-\nleen’s murder was proved beyond a reasonable doubt to be\nespecially cruel, the Arizona Supreme Court relied on the evi-\ndence that Sterleen was bound and witnessed the shooting of\nher husband prior to her murder, causing her mental suffering.\nRobinson, 796 P.2d at 863. As there was no evidence and the\ncourt made no finding that Robinson was present at the time\nof the murder, to support a cruelty finding the court was\nrequired to address whether Robinson in any way intended or\nanticipated the manner of Sterleen’s murder.17 The court did\n  16\n      While the Arizona Supreme Court decision in Carlson clarifying the\ndegree of foreseeability necessary to impute cruelty to a defendant was not\nannounced until after Robinson’s sentence became final, as a substantive\nrule it applies retroactively to Robinson’s petition. See State v. Towery, 64\nP.3d 828, 831 (Ariz. 2003).\n   17\n      We agree with the dissent that Robinson’s absence “does not give him\na pass on culpability,” post at 2762, but it does require that there be evi-\ndence that he intended or anticipated not only the murder but the manner\nof the murder before the “cruelty” prong may be applied. Thus, in State\nv. Dickens, cited by the dissent, the defendant, though absent, told the gun-\nman by walkie-talkie that he should leave no witnesses, knowing full well\nhis accomplice would murder the witnesses brutally. 926 P.2d 468, 474-\n75, 491-92 (Ariz. 1996). Here there was no evidence that even intimates\nthat kind of intent or direction.\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                         2743\nnot even address foreseeability.18 This failure to apply a con-\nstitutionally necessary narrowing principle of state law in\napplying an aggravating factor is clearly arbitrary, and so a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n   [9] Had the Arizona Supreme Court addressed foreseea-\nbility, it could not have rationally found Sterleen’s death, let\nalone its manner, foreseeable with reasonable certainty under\nstate law. The Arizona Supreme Court’s decision in State v.\nCarlson, which similarly involved a murder committed by\naccomplices outside of the presence of the defendant, wholly\nprecludes any rational factfinder from imputing the manner of\nSterleen’s murder to Robinson. Unlike the evidence before us\nhere, the evidence in Carlson made clear that the defendant\nordered the killing of the victim by two accomplices whom\nshe drove and let in to the victim’s apartment. Carlson, 48\nP.3d at 1185. Once in the apartment, one of the accomplices\nstabbed the victim multiple times with his eyes closed. Id. The\ncourt nonetheless held that “cruelty was not properly found”\nbecause the defendant “did not plan how the murder would be\ncommitted and could not have known that Dan would bungle\nit by closing his eyes while he repeatedly stabbed Lynne.” Id.\nat 1193. As in Carlson, there is no admissible evidence that\nRobinson was present at the murder or planned for the manner\nof the murder’s execution. Indeed, there is no evidence Rob-\ninson planned that the murder be committed at all. Further-\nmore, as in Carlson, there is no basis to conclude that\nRobinson’s home-invasion plan was reasonably certain to\ncause death, let alone death following suffering. Robinson\n  18\n    The Arizona Supreme Court did find, in dismissing Robinson’s\nEdmund/Tison claim not on appeal before us, that Robinson acted with\n“reckless indifference to human life.” Robinson, 796 P.2d at 864. This\nfinding does not address the inquiry we are concerned with here: whether\nRobinson acted with a reasonable certainty that Sterleen Hill specifically\nwould be murdered in an especially cruel manner. The fact that Robinson\nacted with a reckless indifference to human life generally does not tell us\nwhether his actions had a reasonable certainty of causing Sterleen Hill’s\nmurder to occur and occur in the manner it did.\n\f2744                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\ncould not have foreseen with any certainty that his accom-\nplices would “bungle” the home invasion and murder Sterleen\nin the manner they did. The Arizona Supreme Court made no\nfinding to that effect. The murder here, like that in Carlson,\nis a near-textbook example of the type of unforeseen event\nthat Arizona courts may not constitutionally rely on to support\na finding of cruelty. We hold that the Arizona Supreme Court\nhere acted arbitrarily.\n\n   [10] We also hold that Robinson’s lack of personal partici-\npation in the murder renders the sentencing court’s applica-\ntion of the heinous or depraved factor arbitrary. Unlike\ncruelty, a finding of heinousness or depravity depends on the\ndefendant’s state of mind. See Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, 80\nF.3d 1301, 1308 (9th Cir. 1996); State v. Newell, 132 P.3d\n833, 849 (Ariz. 2006); State v. Moody , 94 P.3d 1119, 1167\n(Ariz. 2004); Carlson, 48 P.3d at 1191. “The court looks to\na defendant’s words and actions at or near the time of the\noffense to determine a defendant’s state of mind” for purposes\nof finding heinousness and depravity. State v. Murdaugh, 97\nP.3d 844, 856 (Ariz. 2004).19 The Arizona courts have typi-\ncally relied on five factors “to establish a heinous and\ndepraved state of mind”: “(1) relishing the killing, (2) com-\nmission of gratuitous violence, (3) mutilation of the victim,\n(4) senselessness of the killing, and (5) helplessness of the\nvictim.” Carlson, 48 P.3d at 1193-94 (citing Gretzler, 659\nP.2d at 11-12); see also, e.g., State v. Detrich, 932 P.2d 1328,\n1339 (Ariz. 1997).\n  19\n    The Arizona Supreme Court has alternately defined heinousness and\ndepravity as focusing on the state of mind of the “killer,” see, e.g., Arizona\nv. Djerf, 959 P.2d 1274, 1287 (Ariz. 1998), “murderer,” see, e.g., State v.\nLopez, 847 P.2d 1078, 1091 (Ariz. 1992); or “perpetrator,” see, e.g., State\nv. Bocharski, 189 P.3d 403, 420 (Ariz. 2008), rather than the “defendant”\nspecifically. However, it has used these terms exclusively as an alternate\nmeans to identify the defendant, rather than to denote that heinousness and\ndepravity can be found on the basis of the state of mind of an accomplice.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2745\n   [11] The Arizona Supreme Court upheld the sentencing\ncourt’s finding of depravity as to Robinson on the basis that\nthe killing was senseless and that Sterleen was rendered help-\nless prior to her death. Robinson, 796 P.2d at 863. The court\nstated simply that “the gangland-style action of forcing two\nelderly persons to lay [sic] face down on the floor, tying them\nup, then senselessly shooting them amounts to depraved con-\nduct.” Id. We note initially that “senselessness and helpless-\nness will ordinarily not be sufficient to prove heinousness or\ndepravity.” State v. Ross, 886 P.2d 1354, 1363 (Ariz. 1994).\nThe Arizona Supreme Court’s reliance solely on the two least\nprobative of the Gretzler factors does not, however, conclu-\nsively render their finding arbitrary. Rather, our conclusion of\narbitrariness derives from the court’s total failure, again, to\naddress the lack of evidence that Robinson was present for or\nordered the killing of Sterleen. The court offers no explana-\ntion for how events that Robinson had no role in can illumi-\nnate his state of mind at the time they occurred.\n\n   Unsurprisingly, we have located no decision of the Arizona\nSupreme Court prior to or following its decision in this case\nin which a finding of a heinous or depraved state of mind was\nbased on the manner of a killing that a defendant did not par-\nticipate in or direct. The Arizona Supreme Court has generally\nbeen unwilling to impute heinousness and depravity to a\ndefendant based on the actions of an accomplice. See State v.\nRichmond, 886 P.2d 1329, 1335 (Ariz. 1994) (refusing to find\ndefendant possessed a heinous or depraved state of mind\nbased on the driving of a vehicle over the body of the victim\nbecause “the evidence has never been clear regarding who\ndrove the vehicle over the victim”), abrogated on other\ngrounds by State v. Mata, 916 P.2d 1035, 1039 (Ariz. 1996);\nState v. Bracy, 703 P.2d 464, 482 n.8 (Ariz. 1985) (finding\nthat heinousness and depravity could not be shown “by one of\nthe killer’s statements immediately before the killings”\nbecause “[i]t was never proven which of the three murderers\nmade this statement, and we cannot impute vileness on all\nthree men because of the statement of one of them”). We also\n\f2746                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nhave implicitly recognized that the manner of a person’s mur-\nder not performed or intended by a defendant is an “invalid\nconsideration[ ]” in finding depravity. Correll v. Stewart, 137\nF.3d 1404, 1420 (9th Cir. 1998). In the majority of the few\ncases in which the Arizona Supreme Court has been willing\nto impute heinousness or depravity to a defendant who did not\npersonally kill a victim, it has made specific findings regard-\ning the defendant’s presence at and intention to assist the kill-\ning. See State v. Anderson, 111 P.3d 369, 395-96 (Ariz.\n2005); State v. Cook, 821 P.2d 731, 751-52 (Ariz. 1991);\nState v. Correll, 715 P.2d 721, 730-33 (1986); State v. Tison,\n633 P.2d 335, 352-353 (Ariz. 1981). In the cases in which it\nhas considered, but ultimately rejected a finding of heinous-\nness or depravity as to a defendant who did not personally kill\nthe victim, the Arizona Supreme Court has focused its analy-\nsis exclusively on aspects of the killing within the defendant’s\nknowledge and control. See Carlson, 48 P.3d at 1193-94\n(focusing on medical condition of victim chosen by defen-\ndant); State v. Miles; 918 P.2d 1028, 1030 (Ariz. 1996)\n(focusing on defendant’s purpose in having defendant killed\nand defendant’s participation in rendering victim helpless).\n\n   [12] We have located only two cases aside from Robinson\nin which the Arizona Supreme Court has found heinousness\nand depravity as to a defendant who was not present at the\ntime of the killing. The court’s analysis in those cases is\ninstructive as to the arbitrariness of the court’s conclusions\nhere. In State v. Speer, 212 P.3d 787, 791-92 (Ariz. 2009), the\ndefendant, while imprisoned, had an accomplice murder the\nvictim because the victim was a potential witness against the\ndefendant. The court applied the especially heinous, depraved,\nor cruel aggravating factor purely on the basis of the witness\nelimination motive. Id. at 802. In State v. Milke, 865 P.2d 779,\n781-82 (Ariz. 1993), the defendant delivered her four year old\nson to two accomplices who murdered him at her request. The\ncourt found the defendant possessed a heinous and depraved\nstate of mind on the basis of three factors: 1) the senselessness\nof the defendant’s desire to have her son killed; 2) the help-\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                    2747\nlessness of her son at the time she delivered him to his ulti-\nmate killers; 3) and her parental relationship with the victim.\nId. at 785-86. Each of these aspects of the murder related\ndirectly to the defendant’s identity and her personal choices\nand actions. In both cases the defendant ordered the murder,\nso that a fact-based inquiry into the defendant’s state of mind\nconcerning the murder could occur. And at no point in either\ncase did the court rely on or even discuss the actual manner\nin which the defendants’ accomplices murdered their victims,\ninstead focusing on the defendants’ own actions. This focus\nwas presumably because the court realized the irrelevance of\nevents occurring outside of the defendants’ presence or con-\ntrol to understanding their states of mind. The court’s failure\nhere to recognize either the defendant’s lack of any contem-\nporaneous state of mind about a murder he did not order or\nparticipate in, or the irrelevance of the manner of the murder\nin determining Robinson’s state of mind, makes its holding\narbitrary in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n      B.   Claim 8: Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n   A defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel in a crim-\ninal trial includes “the right to the effective assistance of\ncounsel.” McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14\n(1970). The right attaches at both the guilt and sentencing\nphases. Silva v. Woodford, 279 F.3d 825, 836 (9th Cir. 2002).\nTo prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at\nsentencing, Robinson must demonstrate that “the performance\nof his counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonable-\nness at sentencing and . . . that ‘there is a reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different.’ ” Correll, 539\nF.3d at 942 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n694 (1984)). We hold that Robinson has met his burden to\ndemonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n                 1.   Deficient Performance\n\n  Under Strickland we presume that counsel was competent.\nDuncan v. Ornoski, 528 F.3d 1222, 1234 (9th Cir. 2008), cert.\n\f2748                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\ndenied, Duncan v. Ayers, 129 S. Ct. 1614 (2009). Robinson\ncan “rebut this presumption by showing that [counsel’s] per-\nformance was objectively unreasonable under prevailing pro-\nfessional norms and was not the product of sound strategy.”\nId. (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688-89). At the time Robin-\nson was sentenced, prevailing professional norms imposed a\nduty on counsel to adequately investigate, develop, and pre-\nsent mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.\nSee Summerlin, 427 F.3d at 630; Ainsworth v. Woodford, 268\nF.3d 868, 877 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[Investigation] was as crucial\nin 1980 as it is today in order to assure individualized sen-\ntencing and the defendant’s right to a fair and reliable capital\npenalty proceeding.”); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-\n4.1 (2d ed. 1980) (“It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a\nprompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and to\nexplore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the penalty\n[phase].”); see also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91.\n\n   [13] In preparing for the penalty phase of a capital trial,\ndefense counsel has a duty to “conduct a thorough investiga-\ntion of the defendant’s background” in order to discover all\nrelevant mitigating evidence. Correll, 539 F.3d at 942 (quot-\ning Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 396 (2000)); see also\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 415 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (counsel\nhas a duty to make a “diligent investigation into his client’s\ntroubling background and unique personal circumstances”).\nCertain forms of investigation are fundamental to preparing\nfor virtually every capital sentencing proceeding. At the very\nleast, counsel should obtain readily available documentary\nevidence such as school, employment, and medical records,\nsee Ainsworth v. Woodford, 268 F.3d 868, 877 (9th Cir. 2001)\n(concluding that counsel was ineffective because he failed to\nobtain relevant records), and obtain information about the\ndefendant’s character and background, see Boyde v. Califor-\nnia, 494 U.S. 370, 382 (1990) (“[E]vidence about the defen-\ndant’s background and character is relevant because of the\nbelief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit\ncriminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged back-\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2749\nground, or to emotional and mental problems, may be less\nculpable than defendants who have no such excuse.” (internal\nquotation and citation omitted)). The investigation should also\n“include inquiries into social background and evidence of\nfamily abuse.” Summerlin, 427 F.3d at 630 (citing Boyde v.\nBrown, 404 F.3d 1159, 1176 (9th Cir. 2005)). Counsel also\nhas a “duty to investigate and present mitigating evidence of\nmental impairment, which includes examination of mental\nhealth records.” Lambright, 490 F.3d at 1117 (quoting Sum-\nmerlin, 427 F.3d at 630) (internal edits and quotation marks\nomitted). Although counsel will typically begin the investiga-\ntion by interviewing the defendant, the investigation cannot\nend there unless the “defendant has given counsel reason to\nbelieve that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless\nor even harmful.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691.\n\n   In Smith v. Stewart, 140 F.3d 1263 (9th Cir. 1998), counsel\n“did not perform any real investigation into mitigating cir-\ncumstances, even though that evidence was rather near the\nsurface,” and gave no tactical reasons for his failure to do so.\nId. at 1269. At a post-conviction hearing, Smith’s counsel tes-\ntified that he had spoken generally with Smith and with\nSmith’s mother but said that he had received no information\nthat would help with a mitigation defense. Id. We found that\n“the record . . . indicates that counsel asked nothing more than\na few generalized questions and conducted none of the real\nprobing for information that legal praxis assumes and even\ndemands.” Id. We noted that counsel could have pointed to\nSmith’s sociopathic personality, drug history, his “fine set of\nfamily relationships,” and his love and support for his chil-\ndren. Id. Because we found no justification for counsel’s fail-\nure to develop this mitigation evidence, we held that counsel’s\nperformance was ineffective. Id.\n\n   Here, as in Smith, Robinson’s trial counsel engaged in vir-\ntually no investigation and presented very little argument at\nthe sentencing phase of the trial. Robinson’s trial counsel’s\nstrategy at the sentencing phase was to focus on the state’s\n\f2750                     ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nfailure to prove aggravating circumstances. His sentencing\nmemorandum addressed only two statutory mitigating circum-\nstances — Robinson’s minor role in the murder, and the fact\nthat the killing was not foreseeable — and no nonstatutory\nmitigating circumstances. At the sentencing hearing, counsel\ndid not call a single witness or introduce any evidence.\nAlthough Roberson said at argument that he could “cite a\nwhole lot of mitigating factors as far as Fred is concerned,”\nhe only briefly discussed two nonstatutory circumstances: that\nRobinson did not have a history of harming people and that\nhe was “apparently” a good father. The entirety of Roberson’s\noral argument at the penalty phase consisted of ten pages of\ndouble-spaced transcript.\n\n   Roberson conducted no investigation of Robinson’s family\nhistory; he did not speak with any member of Robinson’s\nfamily; he did not request school, medical, or employment\nrecords; and he did not request a mental health evaluation. By\nhis own admission, Roberson limited his preparation to inter-\nviewing Robinson and asking him whether there were any\nwitnesses that should be presented. It is not clear from the\nrecord how many times they met or for how long,20 but it is\nclear that counsel did not ask any probing questions that\nwould likely have led to the discovery of mitigating evidence.\nSee Smith, 140 F.3d at 1269. Additionally, although counsel\nsaid he asked Robinson about potential trial witnesses, he did\nnot say that he informed Robinson about what would consti-\ntute mitigating evidence to enable Robinson to assist effec-\ntively in the investigation.\n\n  [14] Roberson attempted to justify his failure to interview\nRobinson’s family members by explaining that he thought it\nwould be futile because some of Robinson’s family members\nhad testified against him during the guilt phrase of the trial.\nThis decision was not one a reasonably competent attorney\n  20\n    Roberson’s personal time sheets and the time sheets he filed with the\ncourt had been shredded before the evidentiary hearing.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2751\nwould have made. Robinson had fifteen children, only two of\nwhom had testified against him. According to counsel, Robin-\nson was a good father, making it likely that at least some of\nthem would have been willing to testify on his behalf. He also\nhad a wife, ex-wife, parents, and seventeen siblings who not\nonly could have testified on Robinson’s behalf, but also could\nhave provided important background information about Rob-\ninson’s childhood, providing leads for further investigation.\nWe can find no reason for counsel to believe that interviewing\nthese family members would be fruitless.\n\n   Counsel also failed to explore readily available sources of\nmitigating evidence concerning Robinson’s potential for reha-\nbilitation. If counsel had spoken with prison guards, they\nwould have informed him that Robinson was a model pris-\noner. Robinson’s good behavior has continued while he has\nbeen on death row; he gets along well with his fellow inmates,\nhe is visited often by family members, goes to church regu-\nlarly, and is classified as Level Five-One, the lowest security\nlevel possible for a death row inmate. A psychological evalua-\ntion of Robinson would have confirmed that he did not have\na hostile or aggressive personality, but rather was generally\nhelpful and easy going, and thus demonstrated a potential for\nrehabilitation and a low risk of future dangerousness. Counsel\ndid not provide any tactical explanation for not presenting\nevidence of Robinson’s potential for rehabilitation. There was\nno reason not to present such evidence, as this was not a situa-\ntion where introducing character evidence would have opened\nthe door for the prosecution to introduce negative character\nevidence. Counsel’s decision to forgo any investigation into\nRobinson’s potential for rehabilitation, even though such evi-\ndence was close at hand, was not strategic and fell below pre-\nvailing professional norms at that time.\n\n  [15] Had Roberson conducted an effective penalty-phase\ninvestigation, he would have learned of aspects of Robinson’s\ncharacter and background that would have provided classic\nmitigation evidence at sentencing, including: Robinson’s\n\f2752                     ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nimpoverished background; his unstable and often abusive\nupbringing; his multiple episodes of childhood sexual abuse;\nhis low intelligence; his personality disorder; his non-violent\nnature; and his potential for rehabilitation.21 Instead, counsel’s\nlimited investigation yielded almost nothing of use. Accord-\ningly, we conclude that Roberson’s performance was defi-\ncient.\n\n                            2.   Prejudice\n\n   [16] Prejudice in a capital sentencing proceeding is mea-\nsured by “reweigh[ing] the evidence in aggravation against\nthe totality of available mitigating evidence.” Wiggins, 539\nU.S. at 534. Robinson can establish that he was prejudiced by\nshowing that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\nwould have been different.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. A\nreasonable probability is “less than the preponderance more-\nlikely-than-not standard.” Summerlin, 427 F.3d at 643.\nRather, it “is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\nin the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. If there is a rea-\nsonable probability that the sentencing judge would not have\nimposed death if he was aware of the mitigating circum-\nstances, petitioner has been prejudiced and is entitled to relief.\nSummerlin, 427 F.3d at 643 (citing Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 537).\n“[I]t is not necessary for the habeas petitioner to demonstrate\n  21\n    The dissent argues that Roberson’s failure to discover this evidence\ndoes not constitute deficient performance in light of the Supreme Court’s\nrecent decisions in Bobby v. Van Hook, 130 S. Ct. 13 (2009), and Wong\nv. Belmontes, 130 S. Ct. 383 (2009). But in each of those cases, defense\ncounsel presented a significant amount of mitigating evidence, including\nevidence of the kind Roberson failed to present here. See Bobby, 130 S.\nCt. at 18; Wong, 130 S. Ct. at 387. Rather, this case is closely similar to\nPorter v. McCollum, 130 S. Ct. 447 (2009), where the Court found defi-\ncient performance where defense counsel failed to subpoena school, medi-\ncal, or military service records or interview any members of the\ndefendant’s family, and as a result did not learn of his abusive childhood,\nmilitary service, substance abuse, and impaired mental health. Id. at 452-\n53.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                   2753\nthat the newly presented mitigation evidence would necessar-\nily overcome the aggravating circumstances.” Correll, 539\nF.3d at 951-52 (citing Williams, 529 U.S. at 398).\n\n   At the time Robinson was sentenced, Arizona’s death pen-\nalty statute required a judge to impose the death penalty if one\nor more aggravating circumstances were proved beyond a rea-\nsonable doubt and if the mitigation established by a prepon-\nderance of the evidence was not sufficiently substantial to\njustify leniency. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-703(E) (1988) (current\nversion at Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-751). Thus, at that time, “fail-\nure to present a mitigation defense all but assured the imposi-\ntion of a death sentence under Arizona law.” Summerlin, 427\nF.3d at 640. In Summerlin, the sentencing court found that\ntwo aggravating circumstances applied to the defendant: the\ndefendant had a prior felony conviction and committed the\nmurder in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner.\nId. at 641. Because defendant’s counsel presented no mitigat-\ning evidence, the court was bound under Arizona law to\nimpose the death sentence. Id. at 640. We concluded “that the\nfailure of trial counsel to investigate, develop, and present\nmitigating evidence at the penalty phase hearing has under-\nmined our confidence in the sentence of death imposed by the\ntrial judge” because, “[h]ad an adequate mitigation strategy\nbeen presented, there is a ‘reasonable probability’ that an\nobjective sentencing factfinder ‘would have struck a different\nbalance.’ ” Id. at 643 (quoting Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 537).\n\n   The state argues, and the district court held, that Robinson\nwas not prejudiced because Robinson failed to establish a\ncausal connection between the mitigating evidence and the\ncrime. The district court found: (1) that there was no evidence\nthat Robinson’s ability to conform his conduct to the law or\nto know the difference between right and wrong were signifi-\ncantly impaired; (2) that Robinson “did not establish a causal\nconnection between [his impoverished childhood, sexual\nabuse, and unfair treatment] and his offense-related conduct;”\nand (3) that there was no connection between his “substan-\n\f2754                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\ndard education, low average intelligence, diabetes, and physi-\ncal disability” and the crime. The district court concluded that\neven if this evidence had been presented at sentencing, it\n“would have been accorded little mitigating weight” and\ncould not outweigh the two aggravating factors. Thus, it was\n“not reasonably probable” that the proffered evidence would\nhave undermined confidence in the outcome of the sentencing\nhearing.\n\n   [17] The district court’s holding is contrary to Ninth Cir-\ncuit and Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court has\nexpressly rejected the requirement that a defendant establish\nan explanatory nexus between the proffered mitigating evi-\ndence and the crime. See Smith v. Texas, 543 U.S. 37, 45\n(2004) (holding that evidence of a troubled childhood and\nlimited mental abilities is relevant for mitigation purposes).\nWe explained the reasoning behind rejecting a nexus require-\nment as follows:\n\n    If evidence relating to life circumstances with no\n    causal relationship to the crime were to be elimi-\n    nated, significant aspects of a defendant’s disadvan-\n    taged background, emotional and mental problems,\n    and adverse history, as well as his positive character\n    traits, would not be considered, even though some of\n    these factors, both positive and negative, might\n    cause a sentencer to determine that a life sentence,\n    rather than death at the hands of the state, is the\n    appropriate punishment for the particular defendant.\n    This is simply unacceptable in any capital sentencing\n    proceeding, given that “treating each defendant in a\n    capital case with that degree of respect due the\n    uniqueness of the individual,” and determining\n    whether or not he is deserving of execution only\n    after taking his unique life circumstances, disabili-\n    ties, and traits into account, is constitutionally\n    required.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                    2755\nLambright, 490 F.3d at 1115 (quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438\nU.S. 586, 605 (1978)). Moreover, “whether counsel’s failure\nto present evidence related to antisocial personality disorder\nand long-term drug use was prejudicial did not turn on\n‘whether those precluded [the defendant] from knowing right\nfrom wrong . . . .’ ” Id. (quoting Smith, 140 F.3d at 1271).\nThus, the district court erred when it relied on Robinson’s\nfailure to demonstrate a causal connection between the evi-\ndence and the crime as its basis for assigning the evidence\nminimal mitigating weight.\n\n   The state also argues that it was not reasonably likely that\nthe sentencing judge would have rendered a different decision\nif the mitigating evidence had been presented because the Ari-\nzona court already determined in the post-conviction proceed-\nings that the additional evidence was not sufficient to warrant\nleniency. First, the state court, like the district court, errone-\nously imposed a requirement that Robinson prove a causal\nconnection between the mitigation evidence and the crime. It,\ntherefore, improperly rejected or under-weighted valid miti-\ngating evidence. Compounding this problem, the state court\nweighed the proffered evidence against two statutory aggra-\nvating circumstances: especially cruel, heinous, or depraved\nconduct and procuring the commission of the offense by a\npromise of something of pecuniary value. We have held\nabove, however, that the state court arbitrarily applied the\naggravating circumstance of especially cruel, heinous, or\ndepraved conduct to Robinson. Our confidence in the court’s\nimposition of the death sentence has been undermined\nbecause, had the sentencing judge properly evaluated the miti-\ngating evidence offered in the evidentiary hearing and\nweighed it against the single aggravating circumstance of pro-\ncuring the offense by a promise of something of pecuniary\nvalue, there is a reasonable probability that the court would\nhave imposed a sentence other than death. We conclude that\nRobinson has established that he was prejudiced by counsel’s\nineffective assistance.\n\f2756                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\n   [18] In sum, Roberson’s failure to conduct a thorough\ninvestigation of potential mitigating evidence and to present\nan adequate mitigation strategy fell below reasonable stan-\ndards of professional conduct for attorneys representing\ndefendants at a capital sentencing. Robinson was prejudiced\nby counsel’s ineffective assistance because it was reasonably\nlikely that the outcome of sentencing would have been differ-\nent had the state court considered the mitigating evidence in\nthe proper light against the single surviving aggravating cir-\ncumstance. We hold therefore that the district court erred in\nfinding that Robinson did not receive ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.\n\n                      IV.   Conclusion\n\n   [19] The district court erred when it held that Robinson’s\nclaim challenging the application of the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved conduct aggravating circumstance was pro-\ncedurally barred. On the merits, we hold that the state court\narbitrarily and capriciously applied the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved conduct aggravating circumstance to Rob-\ninson. We also hold that Robinson received ineffective\nassistance of counsel in the penalty phase. We conclude that\nRobinson is entitled to relief in the form of a new penalty\nphase trial. We reverse the district court’s denial of a writ of\nhabeas corpus as to the penalty phase and remand with\ninstructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus unless the state\ncourt undertakes resentencing proceedings within a reason-\nable time to be determined by the district court.\n\n   REVERSED and REMANDED for issuance of a condi-\ntional writ of habeas corpus.\n\fROBINSON v. SCHRIRO            2757\n                      Volume 2 of 2\n\f2758                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nRAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   I respectfully dissent. The record in this case supports the\ndistrict court’s determination that Fred Robinson’s claim chal-\nlenging application of the cruelty prong of the “cruel, heinous\nand depraved” aggravating factors under Arizona’s death pen-\nalty statute is procedurally barred. Although a closer question\nis presented by application of the heinous/depraved prongs of\nthe statutory aggravating factors, the Arizona state courts did\nnot act arbitrarily and capriciously in applying the hei-\nnous/depraved prongs of the statutory aggravating factors\nwhen considering the facts underlying the murder of the\nelderly victim. See Styers v. Schriro, 547 F.3d 1026, 1033\n(9th Cir. 2008) (“A state court’s finding of an aggravating cir-\ncumstance in a particular case — including a de novo finding\nby an appellate court that a particular offense is especially\nheinous or depraved — is arbitrary or capricious if and only\nif no reasonable sentencer could have so concluded.”) (cita-\ntion, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted).\nFinally, as recently reiterated by the United States Supreme\nCourt, any failure by defense counsel to present additional\nmitigation evidence did not prejudice Robinson.\n\n   As a preliminary matter, I note that even if the hei-\nnous/depraved prongs of the statutory aggravating factors\nwere arbitrarily applied in determining the sentence to be\nimposed, Robinson’s procedural default of his claim involv-\ning the cruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors\nwould be sufficient to sustain imposition of the death penalty.\nSee State v. Gretzler, 659 P.2d 1, 10 (Ariz. 1983). Therefore,\nI first examine the question of procedural default of the claim\ninvolving application of the cruelty prong of the statutory\naggravating factors.\n\n  To avoid application of the procedural bar to his claim\nchallenging application of the cruelty prong of the statutory\naggravating factors, Robinson was required to “present[ ] the\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                     2759\nfactual and legal basis for his claim[ ] to the state courts\n. . .” Moorman v. Schriro, 426 F.3d 1044, 1056 (9th Cir.\n2005) (emphasis added).\n\n   Before the Arizona Supreme Court, Robinson argued gen-\nerally that “imposition of the death penalty was in violation\nof the statute and of the Constitution of the United States.”\nWe have not deemed a conclusory argument such as this suf-\nficient presentation of a claim to avoid a procedural bar. See\nInsyxiengmay v. Morgan, 403 F.3d 657, 668 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(“In this circuit, the petitioner must make the federal basis of\nthe claim explicit either by specifying particular provisions of\nthe federal Constitution or statutes, or by citing to federal case\nlaw.”). Indeed, Robinson’s specific argument regarding the\ncruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors stated:\n\n    Cruelty involves the infliction of pain and distress on\n    the victims. The State must show by evidence that\n    the victims actually suffered physical or mental pain\n    prior to the death. Cruelty is not shown if the evi-\n    dence is inconclusive. The State produced no evi-\n    dence to show that the victim actually suffered pain\n    or distress to the extent necessary to make this find-\n    ing. Mr. Hill testified that he was not aware of what\n    actually occurred because he was knocked out, not\n    shot. Mrs. Hill’s last words, as heard by Mr. Hill,\n    concerned a desire that her feet be covered up, not\n    a plea for mercy or an expression of fear that she\n    was about to be killed. There is no concrete evidence\n    to support the State’s theory that Mr. Hill was shot\n    first but even if he was, Mrs. Hill was shot almost\n    immediately thereafter without waiting a long time\n    to be shot.\n\n(Emphasis in the original) (citations omitted). The Arizona\nSupreme Court addressed the cruelty factor in the context\npresented by Robinson. See State v. Robinson, 796 P.2d 853,\n862-63 (Ariz. 1990).\n\f2760                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\n   However, in his amended habeas petition, Robinson com-\npletely shifted his argument regarding the cruelty prong.\nThere, Robinson asserted:\n\n      In Robinson’s case, evidence arguably existed from\n      which to conclude that Mrs. Hill suffered, thereby\n      putting at issue the applicability of the ‘cruelty’ fac-\n      tor to the defendants . . . Significantly, neither Judge\n      Bradshaw nor the Arizona Supreme Court made any\n      finding that Robinson either “intended” or “reason-\n      ably foresaw” that Mrs. Hill would suffer as a result\n      of Robinson’s actions. The evidence presented at\n      trial or sentencing was that Robinson was not in the\n      house at the time of the murder. No evidence was\n      introduced at trial and sentencing, excluding the\n      hearsay statements from Washington that were later\n      disallowed, that Robinson had any knowledge that a\n      murder would even take place . . .\n\n(Citations omitted).1\n\n   The majority characterizes the variant argument in the fed-\neral habeas petition as a more detailed theory than the one\nRobinson presented to the Arizona Supreme Court. See\nMajority Opinion, p. 2737. However, the theory presented in\nthe federal habeas petition was markedly different than the\ntheory presented before the Arizona state courts. In the Ari-\nzona state courts, Robinson argued that the cruelty prong of\n  1\n    Acceptance of Robinson’s argument could minimize the importance of\nexhaustion in the habeas context. A habeas petitioner could present one\nargument to the state courts, and, once that argument is rejected, the peti-\ntioner could strategically shift to a new argument in her or his federal\nhabeas petition. This is reflected by Robinson’s contradictory arguments\nbefore the state court (“The State produced no evidence to show that the\nvictim actually suffered pain or distress to the extent necessary to make\nthis finding.”) (emphasis in the original), and in his habeas petition (“In\nRobinson’s case, evidence arguably existed from which to conclude that\nMrs. Hill suffered . . .”).\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                   2761\nthe statutory aggravating factors was inapplicable because\nthere was no evidence that the victim actually suffered signifi-\ncant pain or distress. In his federal habeas petition, Robinson\nargued that the cruelty prong of the statutory aggravating fac-\ntors was inapplicable because there was no evidence that Rob-\ninson intended or reasonably foresaw that the victim would\nsuffer. In the state court, Robinson’s argument focused on the\nvictim’s pain (or lack thereof). In the federal court, Robin-\nson’s argument focused on his intent to cause the victim pain\n(or his lack of intent). It is more accurate to say that Robinson\npresented a different theory in federal court than to say that\nhe presented a more detailed theory in federal court. More to\nthe point, the different theory argued in federal court was\nnever presented to the state courts and is now procedurally\nbarred. See Moorman, 426 F.3d at 1056 (requiring presenta-\ntion of the factual and legal bases of the petitioner’s claim to\nthe state courts).\n\n   Robinson’s citation to Jeffers v. Ricketts, 832 F.2d 476 (9th\nCir. 1987), rev’d sub nom. Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764\n(1990), is singularly unpersuasive. In fact, Robinson’s citation\nto Jeffers underscores his emphasis in state court on the\nasserted lack of pain to the victim. Immediately after the cita-\ntion to Jeffers, Robinson argued that: “An especially cruel\nmurder involves the senseless or sadistic infliction of great\npain. That is not present in this case and, therefore, the sen-\ntence must be supported by heinous and depraved . . .” (Cita-\ntion Omitted). Absolutely no mention was made of\nRobinson’s lack of intent to cause pain when discussing the\ncruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors. More\nimportantly, Robinson’s reference to the fact that he was not\ninside the residence was made in conjunction with his discus-\nsion of the heinous prong of the statutory aggravating factors,\nnot as part of his challenge to application of the cruelty prong\nof the statutory aggravating factors. Fairly read, Robinson’s\nbrief to the Arizona Supreme Court simply did not raise the\nissue he now argues, ie., whether the evidence adequately\nestablished that Robinson had the intent to inflict pain upon\n\f2762                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nthe victim, or reasonably foresaw that the victim would suffer\npain. For that reason, I would hold that Robinson’s challenge\nto the cruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors is\nforeclosed.\n\n   Because the existence of facts supporting application of the\ncruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors would be\nadequate to sustain the death sentence imposed, I would end\nmy analysis of Robinson’s sentencing challenge with that\nconclusion. However, because my colleagues in the majority\nhave also concluded that the state court’s finding that the vic-\ntim was killed in a heinous/depraved manner was arbitrary, I\nwill comment briefly on that point.\n\n   I note initially that Robinson’s absence from the interior of\nthe residence does not give him a pass on culpability for the\nmurder of the elderly victim. See State v. Dickens, 926 P.2d\n468, 491-92 (Ariz. 1996) (in banc); see also State v. Nichols,\n195 P.3d 207, 213 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2008). ([E]vidence that a\ndefendant was not present at a crime scene is not, as a matter\nof law, directly contrary to or inconsistent with a guilty ver-\ndict.”) (citation omitted).\n\n   We should also keep in mind that “[f]ederal habeas review\nof a state court’s application of aggravating factors is limited\nto determining whether the state court’s finding was so arbi-\ntrary or capricious as to constitute an independent due process\nor Eighth Amendment violation.” Moormann, 426 F.3d at\n1053 (9th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). “We examine whether, viewing the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of\nfact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (citation and internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). When viewed through this prism rather\nthan through the lens of a post-hoc factfinder, Robinson’s\nclaim fails.\n\n  Although the Arizona case of State v. Carlson, 48 P.3d\n1180 (Ariz. 2002) (in banc) makes this a closer case on the\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2763\nmerits, I remain of the view that the facts support application\nof the heinous/depraved prongs of the statutory aggravating\nfactors, especially when one considers that the same court that\ndecided Carlson rejected Robinson’s challenge to application\nof the heinous/depraved prongs of the statutory aggravating\nfactors.\n\n   In Carlson, 48 P.3d at 1193, the Arizona Supreme Court\nheld that “[t]he heinous and depraved portion of the [statutory\naggravating factors] focuses on the defendant’s state of mind\nat the time of the crime. However, the inquiry concentrates on\nthe defendant’s mental state as evidenced through [his]\nactions . . .” (citations omitted).\n\n   Robinson relies on his absence from inside the residence to\ndefeat application of the heinous/depraved prongs of the statu-\ntory aggravating factors. However, the Arizona Supreme\nCourt did not view Robinson’s absence as determinative when\ndiscussing the heinous/depraved prongs. See Robinson, 796\nP.2d at 862. To the contrary, the Arizona Supreme Court\nnoted that “Robinson provided the murder weapon and trans-\nported [the triggerman] to the home of his common-law\nwife’s parents. There is no evidence that [the triggerman]\nknew the [victims] or where they lived but for the guidance\nof Robinson.” Although Robinson did not commit the actual\nmurder, the record reflects, and the Arizona Supreme Court\nfound, that he definitely set the murder in motion. See id. at\n864 (noting that “Robinson masterminded the trip). Although\none could disagree with that finding, it is much more difficult\nto argue that the finding is arbitrary. Indeed, to the extent\nRobinson challenges the Arizona Supreme Court’s interpreta-\ntion of the meaning of the statutory aggravating factors, his\nchallenge is unavailing. See id. at 863 (“As difficult as it may\nbe to define depravity, the gangland-style action of forcing\ntwo elderly persons to lay face down on the floor, tying them\nup, then senselessly shooting them amounts to depraved con-\nduct.”) (citation omitted); see also, Langford v. Day, 110 F.3d\n1380, 1389 (9th Cir. 1996) (“We accept a state court’s inter-\n\f2764                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\npretation of state law, and alleged errors in the application of\nstate law are not cognizable in federal habeas corpus . . .”)\n(citations omitted).\n\n   The evidence that a year earlier Robinson and two cohorts\nhad entered Susan’s sister’s home in search of Susan, Robin-\nson’s common-law wife, is not so easily discounted. The two\ncohorts entered the house with guns and tied up Susan’s sister\nand Susan’s niece. Although no one was harmed, the record\nreflects that it was only the presence of Susan’s niece that pre-\nvented a murder from occurring.\n\n   Finally, the United States Supreme Court has decided two\ncases just this month that, in my view, foreclose a determina-\ntion that Robinson was prejudiced by any failure of defense\ncounsel to present additional mitigation evidence during the\nsentencing phase of the proceedings. In Bobby v. Van Hook,\nNo. 09-144, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2009 WL 3712013 (November 9,\n2009), a pre-AEDPA case, see id. at *2, the Supreme Court\nconsidered whether Van Hook’s “attorneys were ineffective\nduring the penalty phase because they did not adequately\ninvestigate and present mitigating evidence . . .” See id. at *1.\nApplying Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the\nSupreme Court ruled that Van Hook suffered no prejudice\nbecause “the minor additional [mitigation] details the trial\ncourt did not hear would [not] have made any difference. Van\nHook, 2009 WL 3712013 at *4.\n\n   Similarly, in Wong v. Belmontes, No. 08-1263, __ S. Ct.\n___ 2009 WL 3712013 (November 9, 2009), the Supreme\nCourt found a lack of prejudice where the petitioner accused\nhis counsel of failing to “dig deeper” for additional mitigating\nevidence. See id. at *4.\n\n   In this case, the majority lists the following “classic mitiga-\ntion evidence” that defense counsel, in the majority’s view\nshould have discovered: “Robinson’s impoverished back-\nground; his unstable and often abusive upbringing; his multi-\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2765\nple episodes of childhood sexual abuse; his low intelligence;\nhis personality disorder; his non-violent nature; and his poten-\ntial for rehabilitation.” See Majority Opinion, p. 2751-52.\nHowever, the Supreme Court’s rulings in Van Hook and\nWong clarify that these asserted failings cannot support a\nclaim under Strickland. Fortuitously, in this case, we do not\nhave to try to determine whether the asserted deficiencies\nwould have made a difference in the sentence imposed. In this\ncase, we know the answer because the same judge who\nimposed the sentence of death presided over the postconvic-\ntion review proceedings. After hearing all the mitigation evi-\ndence that Williams mustered after-the-fact, the sentencing\njudge declined to entertain the prospect of changing the previ-\nously imposed sentence.\n\n   At the postconviction review proceedings before the sen-\ntencing judge, Williams presented testimony from Juan Gon-\nzales, a Corrections Officer at the Florence Correctional\nInstitution. Officer Gonzales testified favorably regarding\nRobinson’s contact with his family and his lack of disciplin-\nary problems. Officer Gonzales testified that Robinson had\nnot displayed any violent tendencies, was “very easy to work\nwith,” and got along well with the other inmates, and had\nbeen classified at the lowest level of security since his incar-\nceration. Officer Gonzales informed the court that Robinson\nattended church “quite often.” According to Officer Gonzales,\nif Robinson were to be placed into the general population, “he\nwould do well.”\n\n   Dr. Tod Roy, a psychologist, testified that, in addition to\nconducting a clinical interview with Robinson, he adminis-\ntered the Minnesota Multi-Phasic Personality Inventory test,\nintelligence testing, the Rorschach diagnostic test and the\nThematic Apperception test. Dr. Roy also reviewed Robin-\nson’s school records and the psychiatric evaluation conducted\nby Dr. Eva McCullars.\n\n  In addition, Dr. Roy interviewed Robinson’s father. Dr.\nRoy opined that Robinson “had the potential to be rehabilitat-\n\f2766                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\ned”; that he had close family ties; that he had good behavior\nwhile imprisoned, noting that he “carrie[d] the lowest risk sta-\ntus that can be applied to anyone on death row”; and that Rob-\ninson was not dangerous or likely to re-offend.\n\n   Dr. Roy disclosed test results reflecting Robinson’s low\nlevel of intelligence and educational achievement, and testi-\nfied at length about Robinson’s disadvantaged childhood,\ndescribing Robinson as “born into an impoverished environ-\nment of a rural nature . . .” He relayed that Robinson lived in\na segregated community and was once “pulled off a sidewalk\nby his aunt to allow a white woman to pass.”\n\n   By far the most traumatic event described by Dr. Roy was\nRobinson’s being sodomized by his mother’s boyfriend when\nhe was a child. Dr. Roy also informed the court about the\nheartbreak Robinson experienced when Robinson’s father\npublicly repudiated Robinson’s mother and most of Robin-\nson’s siblings during divorce proceedings. Finally, Dr. Roy\ntestified that Robinson’s aunt sexually abused him for a\nperiod of time, and that he was subjected to beatings.\n\n  After hearing all this evidence, the post-conviction review\njudge, who was also the sentencing judge, determined that the\nevidence presented would not have affected the sentence\nimposed.\n\n  Specifically, the post-conviction court ruled:\n\n    Mr. Robinson has been examined and found to have\n    no mental [sic] evidence of mental disease per Dr.\n    McCullars and an Axis II suggestion of Borderline\n    Personality Disorder by Dr. Roy. Nothing in the\n    record supports a suggestion that this defendant was\n    unaware of the activities at the Hill home on the eve-\n    ning of the crime and the court now rejects, and\n    would have at sentencing hearings, rejected a sug-\n    gestion of Borderline Personality Disorder.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                    2767\n    This court accepts as true that Mr. Robinson has an\n    antisocial personality disorder and is poorly adjusted\n    to living in society, but there is nothing in his\n    makeup now, nor in the opinion of the experts was\n    there anything at the time of the offenses, which\n    lessened his ability to differentiate right from wrong\n    or to conform his actions with the law . . .\n\n   The court was aware that Robinson was a model prisoner,\nbut remained unconvinced that his model behavior translated\ninto a potential for rehabilitation or lack of future danger to\nsociety. The court held that “to the extent any [of the claimed\nmitigating factors] may be, or have been present [they] cer-\ntainly are/were not sufficient to affect the sentence imposed.”\nThe court explicitly discussed that although a lack of educa-\ntion was shown, no lack of intelligence was shown. Rather,\nthe post-conviction court reviewed Robinson as “experienced,\nstreet smart and . . . wise enough to plan carefully and act\nforcibly for his own well being.” The court reiterated its view\nthat “[n]one of these matters are, or have been sufficient to\nmitigate [Robinson’s] sentence imposed.”\n\n   The state post-conviction court fully considered the mitiga-\ntion evidence presented by Robinson. Its subsequent emphatic\nruling that the mitigation evidence would not have affected\nthe sentence imposed compels a conclusion of no prejudice\nunder the rationale of Van Hook and Wong. For that reason\nand because Robinson’s challenge to the cruelty prong of the\nstatutory aggravating factors is procedurally barred, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n\f",

FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Petitioner Fred Lawrence Robinson appeals the district\ncourt’s denial of his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. Rob-\ninson faces a death sentence imposed by the state of Arizona\nfor the murder of Sterleen Hill. Robinson sought relief from\nhis sentence and conviction on ten grounds in his petition to\nthe district court. Following denial of the petition, the district\ncourt granted a certificate of appealability as to four issues,\nand we subsequently certified an additional five issues for\nappeal. We have jurisdiction over this pre-AEDPA appeal\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and reverse in part and remand\nin part the district court’s determination. We hold that the Ari-\n\f                        ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                      2717\nzona courts arbitrarily found that Robinson committed the\nmurder in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment and that Robinson\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing in vio-\nlation of the Sixth Amendment. We reverse the district court’s\ndenial of those claims and remand to the district court for\nissuance of a writ of habeas corpus striking the application of\nthe especially cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravating factor\nto Robinson and ordering a new sentencing proceeding. We\naffirm the district court’s denial of Robinson’s remaining\nclaims in a memorandum disposition filed concurrently with\nthis opinion.\n\n          I.   Factual and Procedural Background\n\n                         A.    The Crime1\n\n  At around 6 p.m. on June 8, 1987, Robinson drove from\nBanning, California, to Yuma, Arizona with two friends, The-\nodore Washington (“Washington”) and Jimmy Lee Mathers\n(“Mathers”). Earlier that afternoon, Robinson told his son,\nAndre, that the three men were going to Yuma to see if Susan\nHill (“Susan”), Robinson’s common law wife, was there. As\nAndre looked on, the three men loaded two handguns and a\nshot gun into Robinson’s car.\n\n   At around 11:30 p.m., Sterleen Hill (“Sterleen”), Susan’s\nstepmother, heard sounds outside the Hills’ house in Yuma.\nShe told her son LeSean to investigate, but he saw no one. At\napproximately 11:45, someone knocked on the door. When\nLeSean opened it, a man identified himself as James and told\nLeSean that he had some money for Ralph Hill (“Ralph”),\nSusan and LeSean’s father. When LeSean opened the door to\naccept the money, the man, whom LeSean believed to be a\n  1\n    Except as noted, we base our recitation of the facts on the Arizona\nSupreme Court opinion upholding Robinson’s conviction and sentence on\ndirect appeal. See State v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262655\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262655/state-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ariz. 1990).\n\f2718                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nblack man, attempted to grab him. LeSean escaped the man’s\ngrasp, fled the house, and ran to a neighbor’s house to call the\nsheriff.\n\n   As LeSean fled his house, two people entered the home.\nOne of these was later identified by Ralph as a black man\nwith a red bandana who was not Robinson. Ralph heard the\nintruders say that they were narcotics agents and that they\nwanted the drugs and the money. The intruders forced Ster-\nleen and Ralph to lie face-down on the floor of their bedroom\nand bound their hands and feet with electrical cords and neck-\nties. The intruders repeatedly asked where the money was and\nsearched through the bedroom closet and dresser. When Ster-\nleen asked that her feet be covered up, the Hills were both\nshot in the back with a shotgun. Ralph survived with severe\ninjuries, but Sterleen died. A girl who lived across the street\nheard what sounded like gunshots and then heard footsteps on\nthe gravel outside, muffled voices say “hurry up,” a car door\nslam, and a car driving away.\n\n   Shortly after the shootings, Deputy Koteles, who was\nresponding to LeSean’s emergency call, saw Robinson driv-\ning near the Hills’ house. When Robinson passed Koteles,\nRobinson smiled and accelerated as he passed. Robinson was\napprehended in his car shortly thereafter on a road near the\nHills’ home. Deputy Koteles found several bullets in Robin-\nson’s pants pockets. Mathers was apprehended the next day\nafter Susan Hill, who had heard about the shooting and was\non her way to Yuma after stopping in Banning, saw Mathers\nwalking along the road in the direction of Banning. Washing-\nton, who had called his girlfriend at 2:00 a.m. on June 9th to\ntell her that he was stranded in Yuma, was apprehended in\nBanning several days later.\n\n   Subsequent to the shootings, the police found several\npieces of evidence in the fields surrounding the Hill house,\nincluding Robinson’s shotgun, several spent and unspent shot-\ngun shells, a revolver cylinder, a bag containing several bul-\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                   2719\nlets, and a coat that appeared to belong to Washington. The\npolice also found evidence in Robinson’s car, including a box\nof shotgun shells, a red bandana (on which hairs probably\nbelonging to Mathers were found), and a piece of paper with\nthe Hills’ address on it, which had probably been written by\nRobinson.\n\n   In front of the Hills’ home, the police found footprints\nwhich they believed belonged to Robinson, although they did\nnot have a forensic expert evaluate the prints. There was no\nevidence, however, that Robinson had been inside the home.\nNo fingerprints of his were found inside the house, on the\nshotgun, or on any other items believed to have been used in\nthe shooting. Moreover, neither LeSean nor Ralph Hill identi-\nfied Robinson as having been one of the intruders, even\nthough Ralph knew Robinson and was shown a photo lineup\ncontaining Robinson’s photo.\n\n                        B.    The Trial\n\n                       1.    Guilt Phase\n\n  The three men were tried together. The prosecution’s the-\nory at trial was that Robinson had recruited Washington and\nMathers to go with him to Yuma to kidnap Susan Hill. The\nprosecution’s evidence established that Robinson had brought\nguns on his trip to Yuma, had been present in front of the\nHills’ house, and had driven away after the shooting. But the\nprosecution neither argued nor presented evidence that Robin-\nson entered the residence or participated in the actual shoot-\ning. In fact, Ralph specifically testified that the person he saw\nwas not Robinson. Additionally, the prosecution presented no\nevidence or argument that Robinson had instructed Washing-\nton and Mathers to kill the Hills, much less tell them how to\ndo so.\n\n  As further evidence of Robinson’s motive, the prosecution\npresented evidence of two other occasions on which Robinson\n\f2720                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nattempted to get Susan to return to him. The first time, in June\n1986, Susan was staying with her sister in North Hollywood,\nCalifornia. Two men entered the house one after the other,\nthreatened Susan’s sister and 11-year-old niece with hand-\nguns, and tied up their hands with stockings. Approximately\ntwo minutes later Robinson entered the house, by which time\nthe niece had already been untied. Robinson had the sister\ntake him to Susan, who was hiding in the bedroom closet.\nRobinson then cut the stockings off of the sister’s hands, told\nher to return to the living room, and spoke to Susan for about\nhalf an hour. During the conversation, Robinson tried to make\nSusan believe that he missed her and wanted her to come back\nto him, but he also told Susan that he had come with the inten-\ntion of killing her and her sister and that the only thing that\nstopped him was that Susan’s niece was there. The next day,\nSusan left with Robinson for Banning.\n\n   The second occasion was in January of 1987, after Susan\nwent to Philadelphia to stay with family without telling Rob-\ninson where she was going. When Robinson eventually\nlocated her, he went to Philadelphia with Mathers, lured\nSusan to him through a ruse, grabbed her, and took her back\nto Banning.\n\n  All three defendants were found guilty of first-degree mur-\nder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated\nassault, first-degree burglary, and armed robbery.\n\n                    2.   Sentencing Phase\n\n   The prosecution changed its theory of the case at sentenc-\ning. The new theory was that Sterleen died as a result of a\ndrug deal gone bad. Accordingly, the prosecution argued two\nstatutory aggravating circumstances: (1) the defendants com-\nmitted the offense in expectation of the receipt of something\nof pecuniary value, and (2) the defendants committed the\noffense in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner.\nAdditionally, the prosecution specifically argued that the pos-\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2721\nsibility that the conviction rested upon felony-murder was not\na mitigating circumstance in this case because there was no\ndoubt of the defendants’ specific intent to kill.\n\n   In his sentencing memorandum, Robinson’s attorney, Rob-\nert Roberson made several arguments. First, Roberson argued\nthat the Supreme Court’s opinions in Enmund v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110795\"><a href=\"/opinion/110795/enmund-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982), and Tison v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111863\"><a href=\"/opinion/111863/tison-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987),\ncounseled against sentencing Robinson to death because Rob-\ninson was not present at the scene of the killing and the prose-\ncution could not show beyond a reasonable doubt that\nRobinson intended to kill or acted with a reckless indifference\nto human life. Second, Roberson argued that the prosecution\ncould not prove the statutory aggravating circumstances\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Third, he argued that two statu-\ntory mitigating circumstances applied: (1) that Robinson was\na minor participant in the offense, and (2) that it was not rea-\nsonably foreseeable that Robinson’s conduct would cause or\ncreate a grave risk of death to another person. Finally, he\nbriefly argued that Robinson could not be sentenced to death\nbecause he was convicted under the felony murder rule.\nRoberson did not present any non-statutory mitigating factors\nin his sentencing memorandum.\n\n   The court held a single aggravation/mitigation hearing for\nthe three defendants. The prosecution presented several wit-\nnesses, including Major Ralph Ogden, chief deputy for the\nYuma County Sheriff’s office. Ogden testified about state-\nments made to him by Robinson’s co-defendant Washington\nafter the arrest, but the Arizona Supreme Court later deemed\nthis testimony inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause.\n\n   According to Ogden’s second-hand account, Robinson told\nWashington when they arrived in Yuma that they were going\nto “knock off a dope dealer, take his coke and take the cash.”\nHe also instructed them that after Washington and Mathers\nhad gone up to the house, Washington would knock on the\ndoor, and that when somebody opened it, the two men would\n\f2722                       ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nenter and “put the people down,” meaning “get them in chairs\nor whatever.” At that point, Robinson would enter because he\nknew where the cocaine and the money were located. Accord-\ning to Ogden, Washington told him that there was no specific\nplan to kill anybody, but that Mathers was to carry a shotgun\nand Robinson told his accomplices, “if things get rough, shoot\n‘em.”\n\n   Sergeant Roy Brock, also with the Yuma County Sheriff’s\noffice, testified at the sentencing phase about statements that\nRobinson had made to him after the murder. These statements\nindicated that the purpose of the trip to Yuma was to “rip off”\nsome drug dealers. But according to Robinson, Washington\nand Mathers drove to Yuma in a different car and went to the\nwrong house, where they proceeded to commit the crime.2\n\n   Roberson cross-examined the state’s witnesses, but did not\ncall any of his own. In his closing argument, Roberson again\nfocused on the aggravating factors and urged the court to find\nthat the county had not proved the aggravating factors beyond\na reasonable doubt. With respect to mitigation, Roberson\nrelied on his sentencing memorandum, making only a brief\nargument that Robinson “[didn’t] have a history of harming\npeople” and was “a good father apparently.”3 Altogether,\n  2\n     The county also called Dr. Bruce Shirer, a pathologist who performed\nthe autopsy on Sterleen Hill and had testified at trial. Shirer testified that\nthere was no evidence of head trauma that would indicate that Sterleen had\nbeen knocked unconscious; on cross-examination he acknowledged that it\nwas nevertheless possible that she was knocked unconscious shortly\nbefore being shot. Ralph Hill testified at the aggravation/mitigation hear-\ning, but his testimony was directed only toward sentencing for the non-\ncapital offenses for which the defendants were convicted.\n   3\n     The following is the full extent of Roberson’s closing argument on mit-\nigation:\n      I can cite a whole lot of mitigating factors as far as Fred is con-\n      cerned. I can cite a couple that may have a little bearing. Fred,\n      at least as far as the evidence we have received in court, doesn’t\n      have a history of harming people. He may have a history, as\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                        2723\nRoberson’s closing argument consisted of just over ten pages\nof double-spaced transcript.\n\n   The court sentenced Robinson to death.4 The sentencing\njudge found three statutory aggravating factors justifying the\nsentence: (1) Robinson procured the commission of the\noffense by the payment or promise of receipt of something of\npecuniary value by the other defendants; (2) Robinson com-\nmitted the offense for the purpose of receipt of something of\nmonetary value; and (3) Robinson committed the offense in\nan especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner. With\nrespect to mitigating circumstances the court found that (1)\nRobinson’s capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law\nwas not impaired; (2) Robinson was not under duress; (3)\nRobinson was not a minor participant in the crime; (4) it was\nreasonably foreseeable that the offense would create a grave\nrisk of death; (5) Robinson’s age (46 at the time of the mur-\n\n      shown by the evidence, of going after Susan and being involved\n      in some shenanigans that way, but he never hurt anybody as far\n      as we know by the testimony. He is a good father apparently. He\n      has — I don’t remember what the testimony is — 9, 12, 15 kids\n      or something by several different women. He apparently has cus-\n      tody of almost all of them. Even Susan had to testify Fred was\n      a good father. The kids loved him. They were taken care of, fed,\n      clothed, sent off to go to school. The kids testified about having\n      to go to school, getting homework done. They had newspaper\n      routes. I don’t think we can show Fred is some kind of ogre who\n      is a total — and has no redeeming value. I think from the fact he\n      was able to raise, from what I could see from testimony, 2 pretty\n      good kids and presumably the other children just as well as those\n      2. He is able to care for them. He is able to. They love him. I\n      think that’s a little mitigation for him.\n   4\n     Under Arizona law at the time of Robinson’s sentencing, the trial\njudge, not the jury, determined whether aggravating circumstances\napplied. Although the Supreme Court invalidated this sentencing scheme\nin Ring v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121165\"><a href=\"/opinion/121165/ring-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), Ring does not apply retroactively\nto cases on collateral review.

SCHRIRO\nders) was not a mitigating factor; and (6) “no other mitigating\ncircumstances were presented by the defendant for consider-\nation.” Because the trial court found at least one statutory\naggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances, it\nwas bound under then-existing Arizona law to apply the death\npenalty. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-703(E) (1988) (current ver-\nsion at Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-751).\n\n C.    State Appeals and Federal Habeas Corpus Review\n\n                         1.   Direct Appeal\n\n   All three defendants appealed their convictions and sen-\ntences. The Arizona Supreme Court vacated Mathers’s con-\nviction, State v. Mathers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262705\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262705/state-v-mathers/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ariz. 1990), but\nupheld the convictions of Robinson and Washington, State v.\nRobinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262655\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262655/state-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ariz. 1990). Before the Arizona\nSupreme Court, Robinson argued that various evidentiary rul-\nings in the trial court were in error and that his sentence\nshould be vacated because “(1) the killing was not committed\nfor pecuniary gain, (2) the killing was neither depraved nor\nheinous, nor was it cruel, and (3) a further hearing was\nrequired regarding the presence of Tison and Enmund consid-\nerations.” Id. at 858. Although it upheld Robinson’s sentence,\nthe court held that only two of the three aggravating circum-\nstances found by the sentencing court were supported by the\nevidence. Id. at 861-63. The court held that the testimony of\nMajor Ogden as to the statements made to him by Washington\nwas inadmissible because it violated Robinson’s Sixth\nAmendment right to confront a witness against him. Id. at\n861-62. As a result, the court set aside as insufficiently sup-\nported the sentencing court’s finding that Robinson commit-\nted the murder in expectation of something of pecuniary\nvalue. Id. at 862. As for mitigating circumstances, the court\nstated, “Robinson offered no mitigating circumstances and we\nagree with the trial court that none exist.”5 Id. at 863. As a\n  5\n    As explained above, Robinson’s counsel did in fact argue very briefly\nfor two statutory mitigating circumstances and two nonstatutory mitigating\n\f                       ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                     2725\nresult, the court held that “no mitigating circumstances exist\nso as to warrant vacating . . . Robinson’s . . . death sen-\ntence[ ].” Id. at 864. The court also concluded that “imposi-\ntion of the death penalty in the present case is proportional to\nthe sentences imposed in similar cases,” and that the district\ncourt did not commit fundamental error. Id. at 865.\n\n       2.   State Post-Conviction Relief Proceedings\n\n   Robinson then brought a petition for post-conviction relief\nin Arizona state court, making the same arguments that he\nmade on direct appeal and adding a claim for ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The same superior court judge who pre-\nsided over Robinson’s trial also presided over Robinson’s\npost-conviction proceedings. The court conducted an eviden-\ntiary hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nThe court heard testimony from Juan Gonzales, a corrections\nparole officer; Robert Roberson, Robinson’s trial counsel; and\nDr. Tod Roy, a psychologist who examined Robinson in prep-\naration for the evidentiary hearing.\n\n                          a.   Gonzales\n\n   Gonzales’s testimony focused on Robinson’s good behav-\nior in prison. Gonzales testified that Robinson had frequent\ncontact with members of his family, both by mail and by tele-\nphone. Gonzales also testified that Robinson had only two\nminor disciplinary problems in four years and was classified\nas Level Five-One, the lowest security level possible for a\ndeath row inmate, “which means . . . they do what they are\ntold and never get in trouble.” Gonzales testified that Robin-\nson was an insulin-dependent diabetic and that he got along\nwell with other inmates, went to church regularly, and had\n\ncircumstances. That the Arizona Supreme Court wrongly believed that\nRobinson had offered no mitigating circumstances accentuates only the\nfeebleness and brevity of counsel’s effort.\n\f2726                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nadjusted well to life in prison. Gonzales believed that Robin-\nson would do well if he were placed in the general prison pop-\nulation.\n\n                             b.   Roberson\n\n   Roberson testified about his educational and professional\nbackground and about his preparation for the guilt and penalty\nphases of the trial. At the time of the evidentiary hearing, he\nhad been practicing for about twenty years, splitting his time\nmore or less equally between criminal and civil work, and\nthought, although he was not sure, that he had tried at least\none death penalty case prior to Robinson’s. He explained that\nafter being assigned to Robinson’s case, he stopped taking\nnew civil matters so that he would have more time for Robin-\nson. He did not apply for funds for a private investigator, not-\ning that “back during those days we were all doing pretty\nmuch our own investigation.”6 Likewise, he did not hire medi-\ncal or mental health experts, stating that he never observed\nany mental deficiencies, that Robinson never “gave [him] any\nindication that there was some mental problem that he might\nlike to explore,” and that he never got “any inkling” that there\nwas “any kind of a mental problem or psychological explana-\ntion . . . that might have led to Fred’s involvement in this\ncase.”\n\n   Turning specifically to the penalty phase, Roberson\nacknowledged that any type of mitigating evidence could be\npresented at sentencing, not just the five statutory circum-\nstances, and that the nonstatutory factors included potential\nfor rehabilitation, remorse, and family ties. He also acknowl-\nedged that the full extent of his investigation was talking to\nRobinson, and he explained that he did not feel that he could\npresent evidence of remorse or family ties because Robinson\ninsisted he was innocent and two of his sons had testified\n  6\n   The court agreed that “it was rather rare for the court either to hear or\ngrant a request for outside investigators.”\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2727\nagainst him. He acknowledged that he did not subpoena\nschool, medical, mental, or employment records for Robin-\nson, but did not provide any explanation for why he did not\ndo so. He acknowledged that in hindsight he should have con-\nsulted a psychologist or psychiatrist, but said that at the time\nhe did not think it was necessary based on what Robinson had\ntold him. Finally, he acknowledged that he did not call any\nwitnesses on Robinson’s behalf.\n\n                           c.   Roy\n\n  Dr. Roy testified as to the results of his psychological eval-\nuation of Robinson. In preparing his report, Roy conducted\nfourteen hours of face-to-face interviews and testing with\nRobinson and interviewed Robinson’s father.\n\n   Roy described a “number of experiences in [Robinson’s]\ndevelopment that I think contributed to how he viewed peo-\nple[, e]specially in close relationships.” These included\nrepeated childhood sexual abuse, the repudiation of Robin-\nson’s siblings by his father, and physical and emotional abuse\nby his father and stepmother.\n\n   According to Roy’s report, Robinson was born and spent\nhis formative years in a poor, segregated rural community in\nTexas. He described his childhood as close knit until his par-\nents separated when he was nine or ten. His parents’ divorce\nwas particularly difficult for Robinson because his father\nrejected the younger children in open court and the children\nwere separated. Robinson and the older siblings went to live\nwith his father, and the younger siblings stayed with his\nmother.\n\n   Shortly after the divorce, Robinson’s father remarried. His\nnew stepmother had five children of her own and they all\nlived in a very small house. Robinson felt that he and his bio-\nlogical siblings were treated worse than his step-siblings; for\nexample, the step-siblings ate meals first and Robinson and\n\f2728                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nhis siblings ate the leftovers. Robinson reported being beaten\nwith a switch or a belt approximately every other day for\nminor infractions reported by his stepmother. Things\nimproved when the family moved to a larger house, although\nthere was still conflict. In particular, when Robinson was in\nhigh school he worked to save money for a car; not twenty-\nfour hours after he purchased it, his father told him that he\nand Robinson’s stepmother had decided that Robinson would\nhave to give his car to an older stepbrother who in their esti-\nmation needed it more because he was going to college. Rob-\ninson continues to resent his father for doing this, although he\nsays he forgave him.\n\n   Robinson also experienced several incidents of sexual\nabuse. First, his stepmother’s boyfriend sodomized him at\nknifepoint and threatened him with death if he told anyone.\nSecond, when he was about nine years old, he witnessed his\nsister being raped by a white man. Finally, as a young boy he\nhad an aunt who repeatedly performed oral sex on him and\nforced him to do the same to her. Dr. Roy remarked at the evi-\ndentiary hearing that Robinson “was tearful and very reluctant\nto talk about [the rape]. And it was my impression that I was\nthe first person to whom he had disclosed that.” Roy\ndescribed the significance of this type of incident to a child:\n\n    It’s significant because — especially a rape of that\n    nature — it brings very quickly to one’s awareness\n    how powerless one is over the power of someone\n    else, for one. And I believe his life was threatened if\n    he told anyone. One’s achievement, one’s desire to\n    do things can be robbed when arbitrarily they are\n    taken from us, and for reasons that aren’t reasonable\n    and questionable entitlement. That would leave an\n    individual with — who was somewhat confused, in\n    terms of what to expect. It would also create a sense\n    of dependency on these people, because they are the\n    ones that have the power, and that power sometimes\n    is utilized in inappropriate ways.\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                        2729\n   At the time of his conviction, Robinson had been unem-\nployed and receiving disability benefits for approximately\nseven years. He became disabled as a result of a motorcycle\naccident which left him with a pronounced limp. Robinson\nalso claimed that he suffered a head injury as a result of the\naccident, but according to Roy, Robinson’s medical records\nafter his accident “did not report any disturbances that would\nsuggest organic brain damage.”\n\n   Robinson has a very large family. In addition to seventeen\nsiblings, he reported having fifteen children of his own with\nfive different women. Several of these relationships ended or\nhad problems because the women were cheating on him.\n\n   Robinson claims never to have used drugs. At the time of\nhis conviction, he had numerous health problems, including\ndiabetes, high-blood pressure, a broken hip, and poor vision.\nHe had never been evaluated or treated by a mental health\ncare provider until his post-conviction relief evaluation.\n\n   Roy diagnosed Robinson with Adjustment Disorder with\nAnxious Mood (Axis I) and Borderline Personality Disorder\nwith Dependent Features (Axis II), a character disorder that\nleads to a pattern of unstable relationships because of the psy-\nchological defense mechanisms of its sufferers. Roy con-\ncluded in his report that Robinson’s character disorder\nresulted from his caretakers’ disregard for him and his efforts.7\n\n   At the hearing, Roy testified that Robinson “had the poten-\ntial to be rehabilitated,” although there were concerns about\nthe likelihood in light of his age and disability. He also stated\nthat there was a “lack of . . . data to support a hostility\ntowards people.” He found that Robinson had low intelli-\ngence, scoring an I.Q. of 81,8 which is at the tenth percentile\n   7\n     This diagnosis was challenged by the state’s expert, Dr. Eva McCul-\nlars, who based her contrary diagnosis of Anti-Social Personality Disorder\non her review of Roy’s report and a brief interview with Robinson.\n   8\n     An I.Q. of 75 is considered mentally retarded.\n\f2730                 ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nof adults, meaning his intelligence “would be exceeded by\nninety percent of the adult population of this country.” Dr.\nRoy also stated that he did not believe that Robinson had a\npredisposition or propensity towards violence, and that there\nwas no risk of recividism, although he said that he would rec-\nommend Susan stay away from him, because this crime\n“seems to be strictly related to the dynamics in that relation-\nship [with Susan Hill] in his own psychology.”\n\n   The court ultimately denied Robinson’s petition in its\nentirety. With regard to Robinson’s challenge to the applica-\ntion of the especially cruel, heinous, or depraved conduct\naggravator, the court stated that “[n]othing has been presented\nhere except a reiteration of the sentencing proceedings and\nfindings of this court which were later reviewed and upheld\non appeal,” which did not “present a colorable claim.”\n\n   The court was similarly unconvinced regarding Robinson’s\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found\nthat Roberson was not ineffective at sentencing because (1)\n“[i]t was pretty much apparent that the defendant’s family\nwas not going to be the source of much mitigating testimony”;\n(2) evidence that Robinson was “a good and caring father”\nwas balanced by evidence of Robinson’s “aggressive and\ntyrannically possessive attitude concerning his ‘family,’ ”\nincluding Susan Hill; and (3) there was no evidence that Rob-\ninson was “a minor player in the crime[.]” The court also\nfound that Roberson was not ineffective in failing to request\na psychological evaluation. The court accepted as true the\nfinding that Robinson had “an antisocial personality disorder\nand was poorly adjusted to living in society,” but found that\nthere was nothing which would have “lessened his ability to\ndifferentiate right from wrong or to conform his actions with\nthe law” at the time the murder was committed. The court also\nnoted that there was nothing that would have suggested to\nRoberson that a mental examination would be helpful to Rob-\ninson. The court concluded that the results of Dr. Roy’s exam-\nination would not have “altered the sentence imposed.”\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                         2731\nFinally, the court rejected all of Robinson’s claims of mitigat-\ning circumstances.\n\n  The Arizona Supreme Court subsequently denied Robin-\nson’s petition for review without opinion.9\n\n                  3.     Federal Habeas Corpus\n\n   Robinson filed a preliminary habeas petition on March 14,\n1996, in which he requested relief on ten grounds and sought\nappointment of counsel. Counsel was appointed and on May\n6, 1997 an amended petition was filed. Robinson’s amended\npetition made nine claims for relief: (1) ineffective assistance\nof counsel based on his attorney’s conflict of interest; (2) a\ndue process violation based on the trial court’s refusal to give\na requested lesser included offense instruction; (3) the “pro-\ncurement for pecuniary gain” aggravating circumstance was\nunconstitutionally vague; (4) the prosecution’s inconsistent\nmotive theories violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights;\n(5) a violation of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights because the Arizona Supreme Court failed to conduct\na harmless error analysis or re-weigh aggravating and mitigat-\ning circumstances; (6) the application of the “especially hei-\nnous, cruel or depraved” aggravating circumstance to facts of\nthis case violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; (7)\na violation of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights\nbecause there was insufficient evidence that he killed,\nattempted to kill, or intended to kill; (8) ineffective assistance\nof counsel at sentencing; and (9) Arizona’s execution statute\nviolated the ex post facto clause and the Fourteenth and\nEighth Amendments.\n\n   On August 8, 1999, the district court issued an order dis-\n  9\n    Robinson filed a Second Petition for Post Conviction Relief in Arizona\nSuperior Court on February 10, 1998. The state trial court denied the peti-\ntion and the Arizona Supreme Court denied the petition for review. Robin-\nson’s second petition is not at issue in this appeal.\n\f2732                    ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nmissing Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-A as procedurally barred and\nClaim 9 as withdrawn, and ordering briefing on the merits of\nthe remaining issues. On March 17, 2005, the district court\ndenied relief concluding that Claim 5 was procedurally barred\nand that Claims 6-B, 6-C, 7 and 8 lack merit. The court also\nconcluded that Robinson was not entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing in district court on ineffective assistance of counsel.\nThe district court granted a certificate of appealability on\nClaims 6-A, 6-B, 6-C, and 8. We subsequently granted a cer-\ntificate of appealability on Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n                  II.

SCHRIRO                     2733\n                         III.   Discussion\n\n   In this opinion, we consider whether the Arizona state\ncourts arbitrarily and capriciously applied the aggravating cir-\ncumstance of especially cruel, heinous or depraved conduct to\nRobinson and whether Robinson received ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel at sentencing. Because we decide both issues\nin Robinson’s favor, we reverse the district court.\n\n  A.     Claim 6: Especially Cruel, Heinous, or Depraved\n                    Aggravating Factor\n\n   In his federal habeas petition, Robinson argued that the\nespecially cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravating factor,\nAriz. Rev. Stat. § 13-703(F)(6) (1988), was unconstitutional\nas applied to him. The district court divided this claim into\nthree parts:\n\n       (A) Insufficient evidence that Petitioner intended or\n       reasonably foresaw the victim’s suffering resulted in\n       an arbitrary cruelty finding in violation of Petition-\n       er’s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-\n       ments;\n\n       (B) Insufficient evidence of Petitioner’s involvement\n       in the crime resulted in an arbitrary hei-\n       nous/depraved finding in violation of Petitioner’s\n       rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments;\n\n       (C) The (F)(6) aggravating factor, as applied to Peti-\n       tioners case, failed to sufficiently channel the sen-\n       tencer’s discretion in violation of the Eighth and\n       Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe district court rejected claim 6-A as procedurally\ndefaulted. Following briefing on the merits of the remaining\nclaims, the district court concluded that sufficient evidence\nsupported the state courts’ findings that the murder was sense-\n\f2734                     ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nless and the victim helpless, and as a result, that the depravity\nprong of the aggravating factor properly applied to this case.\nBut the court went on to note that even if the depravity find-\ning was unconstitutional, the error was harmless because the\nstate courts’ cruelty finding was sufficiently supported by the\nevidence to apply the aggravating factor to Robinson. The\ncourt also denied Claim 6-C on the merits. We hold that both\nClaims 6-A and 6-B were adequately exhausted and entitle\nRobinson to relief. As we hold that the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved aggravating factor was unconstitutionally\napplied to Robinson pursuant to Claims 6-A and 6-B, we do\nnot reach Claim 6-C.\n\n                        1.    Procedural Bar\n\n   [1] The procedural bar doctrine is a subcategory of the\nindependent and adequate state ground doctrine. See Boyd v.\nThompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755508\"><a href=\"/opinion/755508/98-cal-daily-op-serv-5100-98-daily-journal-dar-7195-danny-boyd-v-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1126 (9th Cir. 1998). The purpose\nof the doctrine is to protect the state’s interests by giving it the\nopportunity to correct its own errors. See Coleman v. Thomp-\nson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750 (1991). Under this doctrine, a federal\ncourt ordinarily will not review a state court ruling if the state\ncourt would find that the claim was barred pursuant to an\nindependent and adequate state procedural rule.10 Id.\n\n   We recognize two types of procedural bars: express and\nimplied. An express procedural bar occurs when the petitioner\nhas presented his claim to the state courts and the state courts\nhave relied on a state procedural rule to deny or dismiss the\nclaim. An implied procedural bar, on the other hand, occurs\nwhen the petitioner has failed to fairly present his claims to\nthe highest state court and would now be barred by a state\n  10\n    The federal court, however, will review the claim if the petitioner can\nshow either cause and prejudice, see Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750, or a fun-\ndamental miscarriage of justice, see Murray v. Carrier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111727\"><a href=\"/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495\n(1986), or if the government waived the procedural default, see Franklin\nv.

We dis-\nagree with the district court’s conclusion that Claim 6-A was\nnot exhausted in Robinson’s direct appeal of his conviction to\nthe Arizona Supreme Court and conclude, as a result, that no\nimplied procedural bar applies.\n\n   [2] In order to exhaust his claim, Robinson was required to\npresent both the factual and legal basis for the claim to the\nstate court.

The citation to Jeffers\nis relevant to this discussion because it put the state court on notice that\nRobinson was arguing that his sentence violated the federal constitution.\nMoreover, at the time Robinson’s appeal was decided, the Ninth Circuit\nopinion in Jeffers had not yet been overruled.\n\f2736                       ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nheld that the especially cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravat-\ning factor was applied arbitrarily to Jeffers, in violation of the\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments, because there was no\nprincipled way to distinguish Jeffers’s conduct from that in\nother cases where the Arizona courts had found that the\nbehavior at issue was not especially heinous or depraved.12 Id.\nat 483-85. In addition, Robinson argued that the murder was\nnot especially cruel because it did not involve “the senseless\nor sadistic infliction of great pain” and pointed out that he was\nnot in the house and did not participate in the actual shooting.13\n\n   The district court erred by concluding that, in his direct\nappeal of his conviction to the Arizona Supreme Court, Rob-\ninson did not fairly present a claim based on lack of intent or\nforeseeability. Robinson argued that “the finding that his acts\nconstituted especially cruel, heinous and depraved activity is\nunconstitutional,” citing to Jeffers in support. Two pages\nlater, he again asserted that “the imposition of the death pen-\nalty in this case was arbitrary and capricious and, therefore,\nunconstitutional.” As part of this same discussion in his brief,\nhe also fairly presented the factual basis for his claim, stress-\ning that “[he] was not even in the house and had no part in\nthe actual shooting.” Earlier in his brief, while arguing against\napplication of especially cruel, heinous, or depraved factor, he\n  12\n      The Arizona Supreme Court had previously held that Jeffers did not\ncommit the murder in an especially cruel manner. Jeffers, 832 F.2d at 483.\n   13\n      Robinson’s briefing in the direct appeal of his conviction to the Ari-\nzona Supreme Court argued that application of the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved factor was unconstitutional because (1) there was no\nevidence that Sterleen Hill suffered, and (2) there was no evidence Robin-\nson participated in the murders. It is specious to assert, as the dissent does,\nthat Robinson now agrees that Mrs. Hill suffered sufficiently to support a\ncruelty finding. Further, Robinson’s two arguments against application of\nthe especially cruel, heinous, or depraved factor are independent of each\nother. Even if Robinson had abandoned the first argument about Mrs.\nHill’s suffering we fail to see why — as the dissent seems to suggest —\nabandoning that argument would mean that he never made the second\nargument about his participation.\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                         2737\nhad already “noted that [he] did not participate in the killing,\ndid not intend anyone to die,” and “was not involved directly\nwith the shooting.” These arguments clearly exhausted the\nfederal claim.\n\n   Robinson was not required to present his arguments in the\nsame amount of detail to the two courts in support of his fed-\neral constitutional claim; he was required only to present to\nthe state court the legal and factual basis of his federal consti-\ntutional claim. Robinson clearly raised the constitutional issue\nby citing to a federal case that held that the application of the\nespecially cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravating factor to\nthe petitioner violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments of the U.S. Constitution. He also specifically noted his\nlack of participation in the shooting in support of his claim.\nHe thus presented the same claim he does now — that, given\nhis lack of participation in the murder, a finding of especial\ncruelty, heinousness and depravity violated his rights.\n\n   It does not matter that Robinson now cites an intervening\ncase, State v. Carlson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"867592\"><a href=\"/opinion/867592/state-v-carlson/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ariz. 2002), for the spe-\ncific holding that the cruelty prong of the “especially cruel,\nheinous, or depraved” factor may not be applied to a defen-\ndant absent intent or reasonable foreseeability. Carlson post-\ndates both Robinson’s direct appeal and his amended federal\nhabeas petition, so he could not have cited it. More impor-\ntantly, Robinson’s state-court argument was that the “espe-\ncially cruel, heinous, or depraved” factor as a whole could not\nbe constitutionally applied to him because there was no evi-\ndence of intent or reasonable foreseeability. His argument,\ntherefore, encompassed the rule that the Arizona Supreme\nCourt specifically adopted in Carlson.14\n  14\n     The dissent distorts the argument Robinson made in his briefing on\ndirect appeal of his conviction to the Arizona Supreme Court.

This interpretation is untenable. The two prongs are\ndiscussed together, in a section of Robinson’s brief headed “Factor 6 of\nA.R.S. 12-703F.” Though Robinson makes one argument — regarding the\nextent of the suffering of the victims — that is directed to the cruelty\nprong only, he ends this section of the brief with a final “not[e]” about\nRobinson’s lack of participation or intent, concluding that paragraph with\nthe statement, “Neither the conduct of the others involved, much less\nAppellant Robinson’s, prove this factor beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Emphasis added.) In the next section of the brief, in the course of discuss-\ning two relevant Supreme Court decisions, Robinson expanded on the\nfacts demonstrating lack of intent and foreseeability. Contrary to the dis-\nsent’s suggestion, the fair reading of the state court briefing is that Robin-\nson argued that the “especially cruel, heinous, and depraved” factor as a\nwhole was unconstitutionally applied in light of Robinson’s lack of partici-\npation in the killings.\n   That Robinson’s current arguments elaborate on those made in state\ncourt does not make his state-court presentation insufficient for purposes\nof exhaustion. In concluding otherwise, the dissent ignores governing law\nand substitutes an exhaustion standard that is wholly unsupported in the\ncase law. It fails to understand that as long as the “ultimate question for\ndisposition” has remained the same in state and federal court, as it has\nhere, “variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its sup-\nport” are entirely legitimate.

SCHRIRO                   2739\nstate court was insufficient to put the state court on notice of\nthe federal claim). Robinson alleged violation of a narrow and\nspecific constitutional guarantee — the right to be free from\nthe arbitrary application of an aggravating factor, leading to\nthe arbitrary imposition of the death penalty — and cited a\nfederal court case, Jeffers, that held that right was violated\nbecause of the way in which the especially cruel, heinous, or\ndepraved factor was applied to the petitioner in that case. He\nalso alleged the factual basis for the claim: the manner of the\nmurder and specifically his lack of participation in the shoot-\ning. This combination was sufficient to present the bases of\nhis federal claim to the state court. Accordingly, we hold that\nRobinson exhausted the claim in state court.\n\n   [4] Because Robinson exhausted this claim in the state\ncourt, federal court review is barred only if the Arizona\nSupreme Court relied on a violation of a state procedural rule\nin rejecting the claim.

In this case, the state supreme court, on direct\nappeal, rejected the claim on the merits. State v. Robinson,\n796 F.2d at 858.

Merits of Claims 6-A and 6-B\n\n   Robinson asserts that insufficient evidence supported the\nArizona Supreme Court’s application of the especially cruel,\nheinous, or depraved aggravating factor. To be applied to a\ndefendant, an aggravating factor must be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Summerlin, 427 F.3d at 642.

SCHRIRO\ncruel, or depraved manner beyond a reasonable doubt was not\nonly erroneous, but “was so arbitrary or capricious as to con-\nstitute an independent due process or Eighth Amendment vio-\nlation.” Id. In making such a determination, the applicable\nstandard of review is that of the “rational factfinder.” Id. at\n781; see also Martinez-Villareal v.

Furthermore, as\nthe especially heinous, cruel, or depraved factor is framed in\nthe disjunctive, we must individually determine that the sen-\ntencing court’s finding of both cruelty and heinousness and\ndepravity were arbitrary to find that the application of the fac-\ntor constituted a constitutional violation. See State v.

Robinson’s challenges to applica-\ntion of both the cruelty and the heinousness and depravity\nprongs fundamentally run parallel. At bottom, Robinson\nasserts that the state courts’ application of both prongs of this\nfactor was arbitrary because there is no admissible evidence\nthat Robinson was present at, intended, or reasonably foresaw\nthe murders. We agree. Applying the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved factor to Robinson based on the manner of\na murder he neither intended, was present for, nor anticipated\nwith reasonable certainty, is an application of Arizona law so\narbitrary as to constitute an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\n   [6] Our review of the record reveals no admissible evi-\ndence or argument placing Robinson inside the Hills’ home at\nthe time of the murder or evidence tending to prove that Rob-\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                        2741\ninson ordered the murder of the Hills. The prosecution never\nargued, nor was any evidence presented, that Robinson\nentered the Hills’ home and was present for, let alone person-\nally performed, the murder. The evidence shows, and the\nprosecution argued, only that Robinson drove Mathers and\nWashington with firearms to the Hills’ home and was present\noutside the residence when the murder occurred. Nor was any\nadmissible evidence presented that Robinson ordered the\ntying up or murder of the Hills. Major Ogden’s statements\nsupporting such a conclusion were deemed inadmissable by\nthe Arizona Supreme Court. Although there was evidence that\na year earlier Robinson had entered Susan’s sister’s house in\nsearch of Susan after two of Robinson’s associates had first\nentered the house with guns and tied up Susan’s sister and\nniece, Robinson did not harm anyone on that occasion and\nthere was no evidence that Robinson had instructed his asso-\nciates to tie up Susan’s sister and niece. Hence, the total evi-\ndence here at most indicates that Robinson formulated and\ninitiated a plan to have Mathers and Washington invade the\nHills’ home to locate Susan or drugs, not any plan to bind and\nmurder the Hills.\n\n   [7] The Arizona Supreme Court’s findings on appeal\nreflect the lack of evidence of Robinson’s presence at or\nordering of the murder. While it found Washington “was at\nleast present in the Hills’ home” when the murder occurred,\nit found only that Robinson “loaded firearms into his vehicle\nin preparation for the trip” and “masterminded the trip.” Rob-\ninson, 796 P.2d at 864.15 The court, however, did not make\n  15\n    We note that, although the jury found Robinson guilty of first degree\nmurder, attempted first degree murder, burglary in the first degree, armed\nrobbery, aggravated assault causing serious physical injury, and aggra-\nvated assault using a deadly weapon, this verdict did not require the jury\nto find that Robinson entered the Hills’ home. The jury was instructed\nboth as to felony murder and accomplice liability and found both Mathers\nand Washington guilty of the same offenses. Either a felony murder or\naccomplice theory allowed the jury to impute guilt to Robinson through\nthe actions of Mathers and Washington.\n\f2742                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nany specific finding that Robinson ordered the binding or kill-\ning of the Hills. Despite the lack of findings on these critical\npoints, the court relied on the specific manner in which Sterl-\neen’s murder was carried out to uphold the especially cruel\nand heinous or depraved aggravating factor. This was an arbi-\ntrary application of state law.\n\n   [8] “There is no vicarious liability for cruelty in capital\ncases absent a plan intended or reasonably certain to cause\nsuffering. The plan must be such that suffering before death\nmust be inherently and reasonably certain to occur, not just an\nuntoward event.” Carlson, 48 P.3d at 1193. To apply “[m]ere\nforeseeability as a benchmark for death in capital cases would\nnot permit the aggravators to serve their constitutional pur-\npose of narrowing the class of first-degree murderers who can\nbe sentenced to death.” Id. at 1192.16 In holding that Ster-\nleen’s murder was proved beyond a reasonable doubt to be\nespecially cruel, the Arizona Supreme Court relied on the evi-\ndence that Sterleen was bound and witnessed the shooting of\nher husband prior to her murder, causing her mental suffering.\nRobinson, 796 P.2d at 863. As there was no evidence and the\ncourt made no finding that Robinson was present at the time\nof the murder, to support a cruelty finding the court was\nrequired to address whether Robinson in any way intended or\nanticipated the manner of Sterleen’s murder.17 The court did\n  16\n      While the Arizona Supreme Court decision in Carlson clarifying the\ndegree of foreseeability necessary to impute cruelty to a defendant was not\nannounced until after Robinson’s sentence became final, as a substantive\nrule it applies retroactively to Robinson’s petition. See State v. Towery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2571606\"><a href=\"/opinion/2571606/state-v-towery/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 831 (Ariz. 2003).\n   17\n      We agree with the dissent that Robinson’s absence “does not give him\na pass on culpability,” post at 2762, but it does require that there be evi-\ndence that he intended or anticipated not only the murder but the manner\nof the murder before the “cruelty” prong may be applied. Thus, in State\nv. Dickens, cited by the dissent, the defendant, though absent, told the gun-\nman by walkie-talkie that he should leave no witnesses, knowing full well\nhis accomplice would murder the witnesses brutally. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160530\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160530/state-v-dickens/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 474-\n75, 491-92 (Ariz. 1996). Here there was no evidence that even intimates\nthat kind of intent or direction.\n\f                         ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                         2743\nnot even address foreseeability.18 This failure to apply a con-\nstitutionally necessary narrowing principle of state law in\napplying an aggravating factor is clearly arbitrary, and so a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n   [9] Had the Arizona Supreme Court addressed foreseea-\nbility, it could not have rationally found Sterleen’s death, let\nalone its manner, foreseeable with reasonable certainty under\nstate law. The Arizona Supreme Court’s decision in State v.\nCarlson, which similarly involved a murder committed by\naccomplices outside of the presence of the defendant, wholly\nprecludes any rational factfinder from imputing the manner of\nSterleen’s murder to Robinson. Unlike the evidence before us\nhere, the evidence in Carlson made clear that the defendant\nordered the killing of the victim by two accomplices whom\nshe drove and let in to the victim’s apartment. Carlson, 48\nP.3d at 1185. Once in the apartment, one of the accomplices\nstabbed the victim multiple times with his eyes closed. Id. The\ncourt nonetheless held that “cruelty was not properly found”\nbecause the defendant “did not plan how the murder would be\ncommitted and could not have known that Dan would bungle\nit by closing his eyes while he repeatedly stabbed Lynne.” Id.\nat 1193. As in Carlson, there is no admissible evidence that\nRobinson was present at the murder or planned for the manner\nof the murder’s execution. Indeed, there is no evidence Rob-\ninson planned that the murder be committed at all. Further-\nmore, as in Carlson, there is no basis to conclude that\nRobinson’s home-invasion plan was reasonably certain to\ncause death, let alone death following suffering. Robinson\n  18\n    The Arizona Supreme Court did find, in dismissing Robinson’s\nEdmund/Tison claim not on appeal before us, that Robinson acted with\n“reckless indifference to human life.” Robinson, 796 P.2d at 864. This\nfinding does not address the inquiry we are concerned with here: whether\nRobinson acted with a reasonable certainty that Sterleen Hill specifically\nwould be murdered in an especially cruel manner. The fact that Robinson\nacted with a reckless indifference to human life generally does not tell us\nwhether his actions had a reasonable certainty of causing Sterleen Hill’s\nmurder to occur and occur in the manner it did.\n\f2744                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\ncould not have foreseen with any certainty that his accom-\nplices would “bungle” the home invasion and murder Sterleen\nin the manner they did. The Arizona Supreme Court made no\nfinding to that effect. The murder here, like that in Carlson,\nis a near-textbook example of the type of unforeseen event\nthat Arizona courts may not constitutionally rely on to support\na finding of cruelty. We hold that the Arizona Supreme Court\nhere acted arbitrarily.\n\n   [10] We also hold that Robinson’s lack of personal partici-\npation in the murder renders the sentencing court’s applica-\ntion of the heinous or depraved factor arbitrary. Unlike\ncruelty, a finding of heinousness or depravity depends on the\ndefendant’s state of mind. See Martinez-Villareal v.

The court\nstated simply that “the gangland-style action of forcing two\nelderly persons to lay [sic] face down on the floor, tying them\nup, then senselessly shooting them amounts to depraved con-\nduct.” Id.

The court offers no explana-\ntion for how events that Robinson had no role in can illumi-\nnate his state of mind at the time they occurred.\n\n   Unsurprisingly, we have located no decision of the Arizona\nSupreme Court prior to or following its decision in this case\nin which a finding of a heinous or depraved state of mind was\nbased on the manner of a killing that a defendant did not par-\nticipate in or direct.

Each of these aspects of the murder related\ndirectly to the defendant’s identity and her personal choices\nand actions. In both cases the defendant ordered the murder,\nso that a fact-based inquiry into the defendant’s state of mind\nconcerning the murder could occur. And at no point in either\ncase did the court rely on or even discuss the actual manner\nin which the defendants’ accomplices murdered their victims,\ninstead focusing on the defendants’ own actions. This focus\nwas presumably because the court realized the irrelevance of\nevents occurring outside of the defendants’ presence or con-\ntrol to understanding their states of mind. The court’s failure\nhere to recognize either the defendant’s lack of any contem-\nporaneous state of mind about a murder he did not order or\nparticipate in, or the irrelevance of the manner of the murder\nin determining Robinson’s state of mind, makes its holding\narbitrary in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n      B.

The investigation should also\n“include inquiries into social background and evidence of\nfamily abuse.” Summerlin, 427 F.3d at 630 (citing Boyde v.\nBrown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789957\"><a href=\"/opinion/789957/richard-boyde-v-jill-brown-warden-of-california-state-prison-at-san/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1176 (9th Cir. 2005)).

Although counsel will typically begin the investiga-\ntion by interviewing the defendant, the investigation cannot\nend there unless the “defendant has given counsel reason to\nbelieve that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless\nor even harmful.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691.\n\n   In Smith v. Stewart, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1998), counsel\n“did not perform any real investigation into mitigating cir-\ncumstances, even though that evidence was rather near the\nsurface,” and gave no tactical reasons for his failure to do so.\nId. at 1269. At a post-conviction hearing, Smith’s counsel tes-\ntified that he had spoken generally with Smith and with\nSmith’s mother but said that he had received no information\nthat would help with a mitigation defense. Id. We found that\n“the record . . . indicates that counsel asked nothing more than\na few generalized questions and conducted none of the real\nprobing for information that legal praxis assumes and even\ndemands.” Id. We noted that counsel could have pointed to\nSmith’s sociopathic personality, drug history, his “fine set of\nfamily relationships,” and his love and support for his chil-\ndren. Id. Because we found no justification for counsel’s fail-\nure to develop this mitigation evidence, we held that counsel’s\nperformance was ineffective. Id.\n\n   Here, as in Smith, Robinson’s trial counsel engaged in vir-\ntually no investigation and presented very little argument at\nthe sentencing phase of the trial. Robinson’s trial counsel’s\nstrategy at the sentencing phase was to focus on the state’s\n\f2750                     ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nfailure to prove aggravating circumstances. His sentencing\nmemorandum addressed only two statutory mitigating circum-\nstances — Robinson’s minor role in the murder, and the fact\nthat the killing was not foreseeable — and no nonstatutory\nmitigating circumstances. At the sentencing hearing, counsel\ndid not call a single witness or introduce any evidence.\nAlthough Roberson said at argument that he could “cite a\nwhole lot of mitigating factors as far as Fred is concerned,”\nhe only briefly discussed two nonstatutory circumstances: that\nRobinson did not have a history of harming people and that\nhe was “apparently” a good father. The entirety of Roberson’s\noral argument at the penalty phase consisted of ten pages of\ndouble-spaced transcript.\n\n   Roberson conducted no investigation of Robinson’s family\nhistory; he did not speak with any member of Robinson’s\nfamily; he did not request school, medical, or employment\nrecords; and he did not request a mental health evaluation. By\nhis own admission, Roberson limited his preparation to inter-\nviewing Robinson and asking him whether there were any\nwitnesses that should be presented. It is not clear from the\nrecord how many times they met or for how long,20 but it is\nclear that counsel did not ask any probing questions that\nwould likely have led to the discovery of mitigating evidence.\nSee Smith, 140 F.3d at 1269. Additionally, although counsel\nsaid he asked Robinson about potential trial witnesses, he did\nnot say that he informed Robinson about what would consti-\ntute mitigating evidence to enable Robinson to assist effec-\ntively in the investigation.\n\n  [14] Roberson attempted to justify his failure to interview\nRobinson’s family members by explaining that he thought it\nwould be futile because some of Robinson’s family members\nhad testified against him during the guilt phrase of the trial.\nThis decision was not one a reasonably competent attorney\n  20\n    Roberson’s personal time sheets and the time sheets he filed with the\ncourt had been shredded before the evidentiary hearing.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2751\nwould have made. Robinson had fifteen children, only two of\nwhom had testified against him. According to counsel, Robin-\nson was a good father, making it likely that at least some of\nthem would have been willing to testify on his behalf. He also\nhad a wife, ex-wife, parents, and seventeen siblings who not\nonly could have testified on Robinson’s behalf, but also could\nhave provided important background information about Rob-\ninson’s childhood, providing leads for further investigation.\nWe can find no reason for counsel to believe that interviewing\nthese family members would be fruitless.\n\n   Counsel also failed to explore readily available sources of\nmitigating evidence concerning Robinson’s potential for reha-\nbilitation. If counsel had spoken with prison guards, they\nwould have informed him that Robinson was a model pris-\noner. Robinson’s good behavior has continued while he has\nbeen on death row; he gets along well with his fellow inmates,\nhe is visited often by family members, goes to church regu-\nlarly, and is classified as Level Five-One, the lowest security\nlevel possible for a death row inmate. A psychological evalua-\ntion of Robinson would have confirmed that he did not have\na hostile or aggressive personality, but rather was generally\nhelpful and easy going, and thus demonstrated a potential for\nrehabilitation and a low risk of future dangerousness. Counsel\ndid not provide any tactical explanation for not presenting\nevidence of Robinson’s potential for rehabilitation. There was\nno reason not to present such evidence, as this was not a situa-\ntion where introducing character evidence would have opened\nthe door for the prosecution to introduce negative character\nevidence. Counsel’s decision to forgo any investigation into\nRobinson’s potential for rehabilitation, even though such evi-\ndence was close at hand, was not strategic and fell below pre-\nvailing professional norms at that time.\n\n  [15] Had Roberson conducted an effective penalty-phase\ninvestigation, he would have learned of aspects of Robinson’s\ncharacter and background that would have provided classic\nmitigation evidence at sentencing, including: Robinson’s\n\f2752                     ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nimpoverished background; his unstable and often abusive\nupbringing; his multiple episodes of childhood sexual abuse;\nhis low intelligence; his personality disorder; his non-violent\nnature; and his potential for rehabilitation.21 Instead, counsel’s\nlimited investigation yielded almost nothing of use. Accord-\ningly, we conclude that Roberson’s performance was defi-\ncient.\n\n                            2.   Prejudice\n\n   [16] Prejudice in a capital sentencing proceeding is mea-\nsured by “reweigh[ing] the evidence in aggravation against\nthe totality of available mitigating evidence.” Wiggins, 539\nU.S. at 534. Robinson can establish that he was prejudiced by\nshowing that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\nwould have been different.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. A\nreasonable probability is “less than the preponderance more-\nlikely-than-not standard.” Summerlin, 427 F.3d at 643.\nRather, it “is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\nin the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. If there is a rea-\nsonable probability that the sentencing judge would not have\nimposed death if he was aware of the mitigating circum-\nstances, petitioner has been prejudiced and is entitled to relief.\nSummerlin, 427 F.3d at 643 (citing Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 537).\n“[I]t is not necessary for the habeas petitioner to demonstrate\n  21\n    The dissent argues that Roberson’s failure to discover this evidence\ndoes not constitute deficient performance in light of the Supreme Court’s\nrecent decisions in Bobby v. Van Hook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758/bobby-v-van-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But in each of those cases, defense\ncounsel presented a significant amount of mitigating evidence, including\nevidence of the kind Roberson failed to present here. See Bobby, 130 S.\nCt. at 18; Wong, 130 S. Ct. at 387. Rather, this case is closely similar to\nPorter v. McCollum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), where the Court found defi-\ncient performance where defense counsel failed to subpoena school, medi-\ncal, or military service records or interview any members of the\ndefendant’s family, and as a result did not learn of his abusive childhood,\nmilitary service, substance abuse, and impaired mental health. Id. at 452-\n53.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                   2753\nthat the newly presented mitigation evidence would necessar-\nily overcome the aggravating circumstances.” Correll, 539\nF.3d at 951-52 (citing Williams, 529 U.S. at 398).\n\n   At the time Robinson was sentenced, Arizona’s death pen-\nalty statute required a judge to impose the death penalty if one\nor more aggravating circumstances were proved beyond a rea-\nsonable doubt and if the mitigation established by a prepon-\nderance of the evidence was not sufficiently substantial to\njustify leniency. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-703(E) (1988) (current\nversion at Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-751). Thus, at that time, “fail-\nure to present a mitigation defense all but assured the imposi-\ntion of a death sentence under Arizona law.” Summerlin, 427\nF.3d at 640. In Summerlin, the sentencing court found that\ntwo aggravating circumstances applied to the defendant: the\ndefendant had a prior felony conviction and committed the\nmurder in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner.\nId. at 641. Because defendant’s counsel presented no mitigat-\ning evidence, the court was bound under Arizona law to\nimpose the death sentence. Id. at 640. We concluded “that the\nfailure of trial counsel to investigate, develop, and present\nmitigating evidence at the penalty phase hearing has under-\nmined our confidence in the sentence of death imposed by the\ntrial judge” because, “[h]ad an adequate mitigation strategy\nbeen presented, there is a ‘reasonable probability’ that an\nobjective sentencing factfinder ‘would have struck a different\nbalance.’ ” Id. at 643 (quoting Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 537).\n\n   The state argues, and the district court held, that Robinson\nwas not prejudiced because Robinson failed to establish a\ncausal connection between the mitigating evidence and the\ncrime. The district court found: (1) that there was no evidence\nthat Robinson’s ability to conform his conduct to the law or\nto know the difference between right and wrong were signifi-\ncantly impaired; (2) that Robinson “did not establish a causal\nconnection between [his impoverished childhood, sexual\nabuse, and unfair treatment] and his offense-related conduct;”\nand (3) that there was no connection between his “substan-\n\f2754                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\ndard education, low average intelligence, diabetes, and physi-\ncal disability” and the crime. The district court concluded that\neven if this evidence had been presented at sentencing, it\n“would have been accorded little mitigating weight” and\ncould not outweigh the two aggravating factors. Thus, it was\n“not reasonably probable” that the proffered evidence would\nhave undermined confidence in the outcome of the sentencing\nhearing.\n\n   [17] The district court’s holding is contrary to Ninth Cir-\ncuit and Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court has\nexpressly rejected the requirement that a defendant establish\nan explanatory nexus between the proffered mitigating evi-\ndence and the crime. See Smith v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137727\"><a href=\"/opinion/137727/smith-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45\n(2004) (holding that evidence of a troubled childhood and\nlimited mental abilities is relevant for mitigation purposes).\nWe explained the reasoning behind rejecting a nexus require-\nment as follows:\n\n    If evidence relating to life circumstances with no\n    causal relationship to the crime were to be elimi-\n    nated, significant aspects of a defendant’s disadvan-\n    taged background, emotional and mental problems,\n    and adverse history, as well as his positive character\n    traits, would not be considered, even though some of\n    these factors, both positive and negative, might\n    cause a sentencer to determine that a life sentence,\n    rather than death at the hands of the state, is the\n    appropriate punishment for the particular defendant.\n    This is simply unacceptable in any capital sentencing\n    proceeding, given that “treating each defendant in a\n    capital case with that degree of respect due the\n    uniqueness of the individual,” and determining\n    whether or not he is deserving of execution only\n    after taking his unique life circumstances, disabili-\n    ties, and traits into account, is constitutionally\n    required.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                    2755\nLambright, 490 F.3d at 1115 (quoting Lockett v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 605 (1978)). Moreover, “whether counsel’s failure\nto present evidence related to antisocial personality disorder\nand long-term drug use was prejudicial did not turn on\n‘whether those precluded [the defendant] from knowing right\nfrom wrong . . . .’ ” Id. (quoting Smith, 140 F.3d at 1271).\nThus, the district court erred when it relied on Robinson’s\nfailure to demonstrate a causal connection between the evi-\ndence and the crime as its basis for assigning the evidence\nminimal mitigating weight.\n\n   The state also argues that it was not reasonably likely that\nthe sentencing judge would have rendered a different decision\nif the mitigating evidence had been presented because the Ari-\nzona court already determined in the post-conviction proceed-\nings that the additional evidence was not sufficient to warrant\nleniency. First, the state court, like the district court, errone-\nously imposed a requirement that Robinson prove a causal\nconnection between the mitigation evidence and the crime. It,\ntherefore, improperly rejected or under-weighted valid miti-\ngating evidence. Compounding this problem, the state court\nweighed the proffered evidence against two statutory aggra-\nvating circumstances: especially cruel, heinous, or depraved\nconduct and procuring the commission of the offense by a\npromise of something of pecuniary value. We have held\nabove, however, that the state court arbitrarily applied the\naggravating circumstance of especially cruel, heinous, or\ndepraved conduct to Robinson. Our confidence in the court’s\nimposition of the death sentence has been undermined\nbecause, had the sentencing judge properly evaluated the miti-\ngating evidence offered in the evidentiary hearing and\nweighed it against the single aggravating circumstance of pro-\ncuring the offense by a promise of something of pecuniary\nvalue, there is a reasonable probability that the court would\nhave imposed a sentence other than death. We conclude that\nRobinson has established that he was prejudiced by counsel’s\nineffective assistance.\n\f2756                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\n   [18] In sum, Roberson’s failure to conduct a thorough\ninvestigation of potential mitigating evidence and to present\nan adequate mitigation strategy fell below reasonable stan-\ndards of professional conduct for attorneys representing\ndefendants at a capital sentencing. Robinson was prejudiced\nby counsel’s ineffective assistance because it was reasonably\nlikely that the outcome of sentencing would have been differ-\nent had the state court considered the mitigating evidence in\nthe proper light against the single surviving aggravating cir-\ncumstance. We hold therefore that the district court erred in\nfinding that Robinson did not receive ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.\n\n                      IV.   Conclusion\n\n   [19] The district court erred when it held that Robinson’s\nclaim challenging the application of the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved conduct aggravating circumstance was pro-\ncedurally barred. On the merits, we hold that the state court\narbitrarily and capriciously applied the especially cruel, hei-\nnous, or depraved conduct aggravating circumstance to Rob-\ninson. We also hold that Robinson received ineffective\nassistance of counsel in the penalty phase. We conclude that\nRobinson is entitled to relief in the form of a new penalty\nphase trial. We reverse the district court’s denial of a writ of\nhabeas corpus as to the penalty phase and remand with\ninstructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus unless the state\ncourt undertakes resentencing proceedings within a reason-\nable time to be determined by the district court.\n\n   REVERSED and REMANDED for issuance of a condi-\ntional writ of habeas corpus.\n\fROBINSON v.

The record in this case supports the\ndistrict court’s determination that Fred Robinson’s claim chal-\nlenging application of the cruelty prong of the “cruel, heinous\nand depraved” aggravating factors under Arizona’s death pen-\nalty statute is procedurally barred. Although a closer question\nis presented by application of the heinous/depraved prongs of\nthe statutory aggravating factors, the Arizona state courts did\nnot act arbitrarily and capriciously in applying the hei-\nnous/depraved prongs of the statutory aggravating factors\nwhen considering the facts underlying the murder of the\nelderly victim.

See\nInsyxiengmay v.

Indeed, Robinson’s specific argument regarding the\ncruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors stated:\n\n    Cruelty involves the infliction of pain and distress on\n    the victims. The State must show by evidence that\n    the victims actually suffered physical or mental pain\n    prior to the death. Cruelty is not shown if the evi-\n    dence is inconclusive. The State produced no evi-\n    dence to show that the victim actually suffered pain\n    or distress to the extent necessary to make this find-\n    ing. Mr. Hill testified that he was not aware of what\n    actually occurred because he was knocked out, not\n    shot. Mrs. Hill’s last words, as heard by Mr. Hill,\n    concerned a desire that her feet be covered up, not\n    a plea for mercy or an expression of fear that she\n    was about to be killed. There is no concrete evidence\n    to support the State’s theory that Mr. Hill was shot\n    first but even if he was, Mrs. Hill was shot almost\n    immediately thereafter without waiting a long time\n    to be shot.\n\n(Emphasis in the original) (citations omitted). The Arizona\nSupreme Court addressed the cruelty factor in the context\npresented by Robinson. See State v.

SCHRIRO\n   However, in his amended habeas petition, Robinson com-\npletely shifted his argument regarding the cruelty prong.\nThere, Robinson asserted:\n\n      In Robinson’s case, evidence arguably existed from\n      which to conclude that Mrs. Hill suffered, thereby\n      putting at issue the applicability of the ‘cruelty’ fac-\n      tor to the defendants . . . Significantly, neither Judge\n      Bradshaw nor the Arizona Supreme Court made any\n      finding that Robinson either “intended” or “reason-\n      ably foresaw” that Mrs. Hill would suffer as a result\n      of Robinson’s actions. The evidence presented at\n      trial or sentencing was that Robinson was not in the\n      house at the time of the murder. No evidence was\n      introduced at trial and sentencing, excluding the\n      hearsay statements from Washington that were later\n      disallowed, that Robinson had any knowledge that a\n      murder would even take place . . .\n\n(Citations omitted).1\n\n   The majority characterizes the variant argument in the fed-\neral habeas petition as a more detailed theory than the one\nRobinson presented to the Arizona Supreme Court. See\nMajority Opinion, p. 2737. However, the theory presented in\nthe federal habeas petition was markedly different than the\ntheory presented before the Arizona state courts. In the Ari-\nzona state courts, Robinson argued that the cruelty prong of\n  1\n    Acceptance of Robinson’s argument could minimize the importance of\nexhaustion in the habeas context. A habeas petitioner could present one\nargument to the state courts, and, once that argument is rejected, the peti-\ntioner could strategically shift to a new argument in her or his federal\nhabeas petition. This is reflected by Robinson’s contradictory arguments\nbefore the state court (“The State produced no evidence to show that the\nvictim actually suffered pain or distress to the extent necessary to make\nthis finding.”) (emphasis in the original), and in his habeas petition (“In\nRobinson’s case, evidence arguably existed from which to conclude that\nMrs. Hill suffered . . .”).\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                   2761\nthe statutory aggravating factors was inapplicable because\nthere was no evidence that the victim actually suffered signifi-\ncant pain or distress. In his federal habeas petition, Robinson\nargued that the cruelty prong of the statutory aggravating fac-\ntors was inapplicable because there was no evidence that Rob-\ninson intended or reasonably foresaw that the victim would\nsuffer. In the state court, Robinson’s argument focused on the\nvictim’s pain (or lack thereof). In the federal court, Robin-\nson’s argument focused on his intent to cause the victim pain\n(or his lack of intent). It is more accurate to say that Robinson\npresented a different theory in federal court than to say that\nhe presented a more detailed theory in federal court. More to\nthe point, the different theory argued in federal court was\nnever presented to the state courts and is now procedurally\nbarred. See Moorman, 426 F.3d at 1056 (requiring presenta-\ntion of the factual and legal bases of the petitioner’s claim to\nthe state courts).\n\n   Robinson’s citation to Jeffers v. Ricketts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496750\"><a href=\"/opinion/496750/jimmie-wayne-jeffers-v-james-r-ricketts-director-arizona-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\nCir. 1987), rev’d sub nom.

In fact, Robinson’s citation\nto Jeffers underscores his emphasis in state court on the\nasserted lack of pain to the victim. Immediately after the cita-\ntion to Jeffers, Robinson argued that: “An especially cruel\nmurder involves the senseless or sadistic infliction of great\npain. That is not present in this case and, therefore, the sen-\ntence must be supported by heinous and depraved . . .” (Cita-\ntion Omitted). Absolutely no mention was made of\nRobinson’s lack of intent to cause pain when discussing the\ncruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors. More\nimportantly, Robinson’s reference to the fact that he was not\ninside the residence was made in conjunction with his discus-\nsion of the heinous prong of the statutory aggravating factors,\nnot as part of his challenge to application of the cruelty prong\nof the statutory aggravating factors. Fairly read, Robinson’s\nbrief to the Arizona Supreme Court simply did not raise the\nissue he now argues, ie., whether the evidence adequately\nestablished that Robinson had the intent to inflict pain upon\n\f2762                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\nthe victim, or reasonably foresaw that the victim would suffer\npain. For that reason, I would hold that Robinson’s challenge\nto the cruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors is\nforeclosed.\n\n   Because the existence of facts supporting application of the\ncruelty prong of the statutory aggravating factors would be\nadequate to sustain the death sentence imposed, I would end\nmy analysis of Robinson’s sentencing challenge with that\nconclusion. However, because my colleagues in the majority\nhave also concluded that the state court’s finding that the vic-\ntim was killed in a heinous/depraved manner was arbitrary, I\nwill comment briefly on that point.\n\n   I note initially that Robinson’s absence from the interior of\nthe residence does not give him a pass on culpability for the\nmurder of the elderly victim.

Dickens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160530\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160530/state-v-dickens/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491-92 (Ariz. 1996) (in banc); see also State v.

(citation and internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). When viewed through this prism rather\nthan through the lens of a post-hoc factfinder, Robinson’s\nclaim fails.\n\n  Although the Arizona case of State v. Carlson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"867592\"><a href=\"/opinion/867592/state-v-carlson/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ariz. 2002) (in banc) makes this a closer case on the\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2763\nmerits, I remain of the view that the facts support application\nof the heinous/depraved prongs of the statutory aggravating\nfactors, especially when one considers that the same court that\ndecided Carlson rejected Robinson’s challenge to application\nof the heinous/depraved prongs of the statutory aggravating\nfactors.\n\n   In Carlson, 48 P.3d at 1193, the Arizona Supreme Court\nheld that “[t]he heinous and depraved portion of the [statutory\naggravating factors] focuses on the defendant’s state of mind\nat the time of the crime. However, the inquiry concentrates on\nthe defendant’s mental state as evidenced through [his]\nactions . . .” (citations omitted).\n\n   Robinson relies on his absence from inside the residence to\ndefeat application of the heinous/depraved prongs of the statu-\ntory aggravating factors. However, the Arizona Supreme\nCourt did not view Robinson’s absence as determinative when\ndiscussing the heinous/depraved prongs. See Robinson, 796\nP.2d at 862. To the contrary, the Arizona Supreme Court\nnoted that “Robinson provided the murder weapon and trans-\nported [the triggerman] to the home of his common-law\nwife’s parents. There is no evidence that [the triggerman]\nknew the [victims] or where they lived but for the guidance\nof Robinson.” Although Robinson did not commit the actual\nmurder, the record reflects, and the Arizona Supreme Court\nfound, that he definitely set the murder in motion. See id. at\n864 (noting that “Robinson masterminded the trip). Although\none could disagree with that finding, it is much more difficult\nto argue that the finding is arbitrary. Indeed, to the extent\nRobinson challenges the Arizona Supreme Court’s interpreta-\ntion of the meaning of the statutory aggravating factors, his\nchallenge is unavailing. See id. at 863 (“As difficult as it may\nbe to define depravity, the gangland-style action of forcing\ntwo elderly persons to lay face down on the floor, tying them\nup, then senselessly shooting them amounts to depraved con-\nduct.”) (citation omitted); see also, Langford v.

The two\ncohorts entered the house with guns and tied up Susan’s sister\nand Susan’s niece. Although no one was harmed, the record\nreflects that it was only the presence of Susan’s niece that pre-\nvented a murder from occurring.\n\n   Finally, the United States Supreme Court has decided two\ncases just this month that, in my view, foreclose a determina-\ntion that Robinson was prejudiced by any failure of defense\ncounsel to present additional mitigation evidence during the\nsentencing phase of the proceedings.

See id. at *4.\n\n   In this case, the majority lists the following “classic mitiga-\ntion evidence” that defense counsel, in the majority’s view\nshould have discovered: “Robinson’s impoverished back-\nground; his unstable and often abusive upbringing; his multi-\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                  2765\nple episodes of childhood sexual abuse; his low intelligence;\nhis personality disorder; his non-violent nature; and his poten-\ntial for rehabilitation.” See Majority Opinion, p. 2751-52.\nHowever, the Supreme Court’s rulings in Van Hook and\nWong clarify that these asserted failings cannot support a\nclaim under Strickland. Fortuitously, in this case, we do not\nhave to try to determine whether the asserted deficiencies\nwould have made a difference in the sentence imposed. In this\ncase, we know the answer because the same judge who\nimposed the sentence of death presided over the postconvic-\ntion review proceedings. After hearing all the mitigation evi-\ndence that Williams mustered after-the-fact, the sentencing\njudge declined to entertain the prospect of changing the previ-\nously imposed sentence.\n\n   At the postconviction review proceedings before the sen-\ntencing judge, Williams presented testimony from Juan Gon-\nzales, a Corrections Officer at the Florence Correctional\nInstitution. Officer Gonzales testified favorably regarding\nRobinson’s contact with his family and his lack of disciplin-\nary problems. Officer Gonzales testified that Robinson had\nnot displayed any violent tendencies, was “very easy to work\nwith,” and got along well with the other inmates, and had\nbeen classified at the lowest level of security since his incar-\nceration. Officer Gonzales informed the court that Robinson\nattended church “quite often.” According to Officer Gonzales,\nif Robinson were to be placed into the general population, “he\nwould do well.”\n\n   Dr. Tod Roy, a psychologist, testified that, in addition to\nconducting a clinical interview with Robinson, he adminis-\ntered the Minnesota Multi-Phasic Personality Inventory test,\nintelligence testing, the Rorschach diagnostic test and the\nThematic Apperception test. Dr. Roy also reviewed Robin-\nson’s school records and the psychiatric evaluation conducted\nby Dr. Eva McCullars.\n\n  In addition, Dr. Roy interviewed Robinson’s father. Dr.\nRoy opined that Robinson “had the potential to be rehabilitat-\n\f2766                  ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO\ned”; that he had close family ties; that he had good behavior\nwhile imprisoned, noting that he “carrie[d] the lowest risk sta-\ntus that can be applied to anyone on death row”; and that Rob-\ninson was not dangerous or likely to re-offend.\n\n   Dr. Roy disclosed test results reflecting Robinson’s low\nlevel of intelligence and educational achievement, and testi-\nfied at length about Robinson’s disadvantaged childhood,\ndescribing Robinson as “born into an impoverished environ-\nment of a rural nature . . .” He relayed that Robinson lived in\na segregated community and was once “pulled off a sidewalk\nby his aunt to allow a white woman to pass.”\n\n   By far the most traumatic event described by Dr. Roy was\nRobinson’s being sodomized by his mother’s boyfriend when\nhe was a child. Dr. Roy also informed the court about the\nheartbreak Robinson experienced when Robinson’s father\npublicly repudiated Robinson’s mother and most of Robin-\nson’s siblings during divorce proceedings. Finally, Dr. Roy\ntestified that Robinson’s aunt sexually abused him for a\nperiod of time, and that he was subjected to beatings.\n\n  After hearing all this evidence, the post-conviction review\njudge, who was also the sentencing judge, determined that the\nevidence presented would not have affected the sentence\nimposed.\n\n  Specifically, the post-conviction court ruled:\n\n    Mr. Robinson has been examined and found to have\n    no mental [sic] evidence of mental disease per Dr.\n    McCullars and an Axis II suggestion of Borderline\n    Personality Disorder by Dr. Roy. Nothing in the\n    record supports a suggestion that this defendant was\n    unaware of the activities at the Hill home on the eve-\n    ning of the crime and the court now rejects, and\n    would have at sentencing hearings, rejected a sug-\n    gestion of Borderline Personality Disorder.\n\f                      ROBINSON v. SCHRIRO                    2767\n    This court accepts as true that Mr. Robinson has an\n    antisocial personality disorder and is poorly adjusted\n    to living in society, but there is nothing in his\n    makeup now, nor in the opinion of the experts was\n    there anything at the time of the offenses, which\n    lessened his ability to differentiate right from wrong\n    or to conform his actions with the law . . .\n\n   The court was aware that Robinson was a model prisoner,\nbut remained unconvinced that his model behavior translated\ninto a potential for rehabilitation or lack of future danger to\nsociety. The court held that “to the extent any [of the claimed\nmitigating factors] may be, or have been present [they] cer-\ntainly are/were not sufficient to affect the sentence imposed.”\nThe court explicitly discussed that although a lack of educa-\ntion was shown, no lack of intelligence was shown. Rather,\nthe post-conviction court reviewed Robinson as “experienced,\nstreet smart and . . . wise enough to plan carefully and act\nforcibly for his own well being.” The court reiterated its view\nthat “[n]one of these matters are, or have been sufficient to\nmitigate [Robinson’s] sentence imposed.”\n\n   The state post-conviction court fully considered the mitiga-\ntion evidence presented by Robinson. Its subsequent emphatic\nruling that the mitigation evidence would not have affected\nthe sentence imposed compels a conclusion of no prejudice\nunder the rationale of Van Hook and Wong. For that reason\nand because Robinson’s challenge to the cruelty prong of the\nstatutory aggravating factors is procedurally barred, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
