None of the constitutional provisions Amadeo invokes applies to\n\nhis situation. See Breed v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519, 528 (1975) (holding that the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause applies only to criminal proceedings); Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 567 (1974) (holding that inmates have no right to\n\nconfrontation at disciplinary proceedings); Russell v.

McCarthy, 801 F.2d 1080, 1100–01 (9th\n\nCir. 1986) (holding that when prison officials determine whether a prisoner is to be\n\nsegregated, due process only requires an informal nonadversarial hearing, notice to\n\nthe prisoner of the charges against him and a chance for the prisoner to present his\n\nor her views).\n\n                                          II\n\n      The district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on\n\nAmadeo’s due process and First Amendment claims. The decision to place\n\nAmadeo in administrative segregation was supported by evidence. See\n\nSuperintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 455 (1985) (requiring “some evidence”).\n\nAnd Amadeo had no right to advance notice that his tattoos would be used as\n\nevidence at his hearings. See Toussaint, 801 F.2d at 1100–01.\n\n      The use of Amadeo’s “skinhead” and “mother fucken’ cop killer” tattoos as\n\nevidence at his administrative segregation hearing did not violate his First\n\n\n                                          3\n\fAmendment rights. See Dawson v.

Furthermore, the administrative segregation of a\n\nprisoner is “reasonably related” to the “legitimate penological interest” of\n\nmaintaining order and safety within the prison. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78,\n\n89 (1987).\n\n      As none of Amadeo's constitutional rights were violated, “there is no\n\nnecessity for further inquiries regarding qualified immunity.” Saucier v. Katz, 533\n\nU.S. 194, 201 (2001).\n\n                                          III\n\n      The district court properly denied Amadeo’s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n37(c)(1) motion to strike the defendants’ declaration in support of their motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Amadeo does not demonstrate that the defendants were\n\nrequired to disclose their declarations under Rules 26(a) or 26(e) because Amadeo\n\ncannot show that he moved to compel disclosure or discovery of the disputed\n\ndeclarations. See Fed. R. Civ.
