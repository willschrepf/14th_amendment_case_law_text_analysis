In it,\n\nhe hopes to be able to prove that one of the key witnesses committed perjury.\n\n       This court has jurisdiction to entertain this Writ under Article 11.072 of the Texas\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure. According to the Code of Criminal Procedure 11.14 (1 ),\n\nPetitioner has his liberty restrained, and in 11.21 is the subject of coercive measures, and\n\n11.22 is under control and restraint. This is true even if he is not on probation, parole,\n\nand/or discharges his sentence. Additionally, retaining this conviction would categorize\n\nhim as a habitual criminal and would furthermore subject him to the rule of \"3 strikes,\n\nyou're out.\"\n\n\n\nBRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE UP TO AND INCLUDING THE TRIAL\n\n\n\n       Petitioner was renting a house from Tina Hernandez, who was living in Amarillo.\n\nIn November 2009, Petitioner and wife separate due to the stress of being harassed by\n\nneighbors and unable to find steady employment both because of his status as a registered\n\nsex offender. In the same month, Hernandez orders the Petitioner to leave by the end of\n\nthe month because she is moving back in. Petitioner finds no place that will admit him\n\nbecause of his labeled status as a \"sex offender\" (which is a misnomer because it implies\n\n\n                                             5\n\fthat the Petitioner in presently acting out as such). After she moves into the house in late\n\nNovember with Simon living now in one of the rooms, the hostility becomes so intolerant\n\nbecause of money owed her that Petitioner either sleeps in his car in the driveway in\n\norder to comply with the law 4RR47, 50, since there is no requirement that a person must\n\nsleep in a particular area of the property 3RR60, or sleeps in a nearby business parking\n\nlot as he tries to find a residence. On December 3, he contacts Officer Allen that he is\n\ngoing to move 3RR65-66, but has not yet found a place to do so. Tina Hernandez, on her\n\nown initiative, contacts Mr. Allen claiming that Simon moved away weeks before.\n\n       Petitioner at the time is separated from his wife [see item #1]; she asks him to\n\nbabysit the children for a couple of days while she is away on work [see item #2] for a\n\nthree days 4RR9-12. He does so. On the first morning, on his way to dropping off his\n\nchildren at school, he is stopped on a routine traffic stop and extensively and belligerently\n\ninterrogated by the officer who is convinced, upon running a background check, that he is\n\nin the process of kidnapping children; the children are scared by his demeanor and when\n\nthey finally calm down to verify their identity, he is free to go; Simon is arrested that\n\nnight, at the children's home. 4RR68-69\n\n       In 1985, Armando Simon was convicted of Sexual Assault; this was his only\n\nfelony conviction until the present case. Petitioner was indicted on February 25, 2010\n\nwith failure to Register a Change of Address in cause number 2010-CR-2132. Petitioner\n\nrejected nearly a dozen offers of probation from the prosecution in exchange for a guilty\n\nplea and instead elected to represent himself at his trial. Although the case was tried in\n\nthe 290th District Court, Judge Melisa Skinner's Court, the case was presided over by\n\nvisiting Judge Pat Priest. On October 19, 2011 the jury convicted Petitioner. On the same\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fday, Judge Priest assessed punishment at 2 years in the Texas Department of Criminal\n\nJustice, but the sentence was probated for a period of 10 years. 4RR96-97.\n\n\n\nBRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE SUBSEQUENT TO TRIAL\n\n\n\n       An appeal was prepared and submitted on April 3, 2012, by a Court appointed\n\nattorney; it is important to note that said attorney refused to include various issues that\n\nPetitioner strongly felt were crucial to the case and which are included herein,\n\nconcentrating instead on the insufficiency of evidence, because she claimed the Court\n\nwould not be able to concentrate on too many grounds, or, because they were\n\ninapplicable for an appeal; nonetheless, they could have been, and are, of relevance in a\n\nwrit ofhabeas corpus. No. 04-11-00783-CR [see Secondary Appendix]\n\n       The 4th court of Appeals denied the appeal, Simon v. State WL 2012, 4900916.\n\nDuring the appeal process, Defendant did not report to the probation bureaucracy. Upon\n\nreceiving notice that the 4th Court had denied the appeal, Defendant decided to continue\n\nto the next step with a Petition for discretionary Review (PDR), carried out pro se, filed\n\non November 6, 2012 with the Court of Criminal Appeals. On February 12, 2013, the\n\nPDR was denied in cause 1599-12, notification arriving in a white card. Upon receiving\n\nthe said white card, Petitioner immediately reported to the probation bureaucracy, which\n\ntypically had no record of the matter but which put him right away in probation status,\n\nwith minor restrictions.\n\n       On, or about March 1, 2013 Petitioner received a visit from his probation officer\n\nand disagreements ensued, which resulted in having additional, harsh, conditions added\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fon by the Court after a report was filed, said report Petitioner was not privy to. One of\n\nthem was to attend sex offender counseling sessions conducted by a policeman. Petitioner\n\ndid not do so, was arrested on or about April4 and his probation revoked on or about the\n\n24th of April.\n\n        Meantime, Petitioner had filed an Article 11.072 Writ of Habeas Corpus with the\n\ntrial court on March 12, 2013, citing the conditions of community supervision as well as\n\nerrors in the trial itself. On May 31, 2013 the Court denied the writ on the basis that\n\nPetitioner had filed it prior to the mandate (04-11-00783-CR) from the Court of Appeals\n\nissuing its mandate on March 19, which the Court itself admitted was a legal technicality.\n\n        Thereupon, Petitioner filed a 2254 Writ of Habeas Corpus with the U.S. District\n\nCourt on June 28, 2013. A year later, the Court denied the writ, agreeing with the State\n\ncounsel that exhaustion of State remedies had not occurred; in doing so, the Court\n\nignored Petitioner's rejoinder that doing so would have been a fruitless endeavor since\n\nthe higher State Courts would have agreed that the writ had been filed a few days too\n\nearly, prior to the mandate (04-11-00783-CR) being issued, and time was ticking. The\n\nCourt also ignored Petitioner's pointing out that, comity notwithstanding, according to\n\nDoctor v. Walters C.A. (Pa) 1996, F.3d 675 and Murray v. Carrier 477 U.S. 478, 496,\n\n106 S. Ct. 2649, an exception can be made in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice, or,\n\nwhen going back to the State level would be fruitless, thereby avoiding a bureaucratic\n\nmentality. Petitioner had also pointed out that going back to square one would be\n\ntantamount to putting him in the role of Sisyphus. Nonetheless, the Court denied the writ\n\nand, in disgust, Petitioner allowed the deadline to elapse before appealing to the U.S. 5th\n\nCircuit Court.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       However, to make this case even more convoluted, on January 28, 2014,\n\nPetitioner, who was in county jail at the time, was placed on parole even though his\n\nappeal on the revocation of his probation was still pending Simon v. State, 2014 WL\n\n129635; this parole status ceased in May while Petitioner awaited the 4th Court of\n\nAppeals decision on the revocation. On July 30, 2014 the Court of Appeals vacated the\n\nrevocation of probation on the basis that the judge had abused its discretion. Petitioner\n\nhad filed a writ of habeas corpus on September 24, 2014. The next day, Petitioner was\n\nplaced on community supervision with restrictions against his religion being placed [item\n\n# 16]. The writ was denied on October 9 because it was filed prior to the mandate being\n\nissued and received by the Court. Petitioner once more filed the writ of habeas corpus on\n\nDecember 4, 2014 to begin the process all over again. On March 4, 2015, to absolutely no\n\none's surprise the writ was denied.\n\n       Whereupon Petitioner files this writ of habeas corpus with the 4th Court of\n\nAppeals to begin the process. All over again. All evidence cited in the present writ is on\n\nrecord with the trial court in the previous writ. Petitioner cannot produce copies of the\n\nevidence, and, of multiple copies of this writ due to dire financial reasons. Additionally,\n\ntwo items have recently come into his possession (after being lost) which will be relevant\n\nto this matter and are appended in Secondary Appendix, attached herein.\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f              ISSUES PRESENTED IN THIS WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n\n\n\n#1 The Wrong Case was Prosecuted\n\n#2 Voi Dire\n\n#3 Grand Jury\n\n#4 Mistrial\n\n#5 Questionnaire\n\n#6 Perjured testimony by Tina Hernandez\n\n#7 Destruction of exculpatory evidence & perjury by Curtis Hermosillo\n\n#8 Overbreadth\n\n#9 The law is un-Constitutional\n\n#10 Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n# 11 Bill of Attainder\n\n#12 Conditions of probation & parole are unconstitutional\n\n# 13 Cruel and unusual punishment\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f                                    ARGUMENTS\n\n\n\n#1 WRONG CASE WAS PROSECUTED\n\n\n\n       The trial took place for case 2009-CR-7309. 2RR4 This case is case 2010-CR-\n\n2132. As bizarre as it may seem, Petitioner was incarcerated for a crime that he did not\n\ncommit, and has served time for a trial that never took place.\n\n       The scheduled trial was for case 2009-CR-7309. However, the witnesses,\n\nevidence, circumstances, and testimony were all irrelevant to that case, but, they were\n\nrelevant to case 2010-CR-2132. Then, about two days after the end of the trial the State\n\ncompounded its blunder by dropping case 2009-CR-7309 for lack of evidence [see item\n\n#3]. To cap it all off, all further legal proceedings have taken place for case #20110-CR-\n\n2132 (including this writ) as if it had originally gone to trial. The 14th Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution states, in part: \"No State shall make or enforce any law\n\nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall\n\nany State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" As\n\nwell as the 5th Amendment: \"nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be\n\ntwice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a\n\nwitness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process\n\nof law.\"\n\n       Is this a legal technicality? Of course it is. But so was ruling against Petitioner's\n\noriginal writ of habeas corpus by the trial Court, and the Federal District Court, legal\n\ntechnicalities. For that matter---assuming for the sake of argument---that Petitioner did\n\n\n                                             11\n\findeed move and not report a change of address for a couple of weeks, that too would\n\nhave been a legal technicality. So this is not a matter of De minimis non curat lex (the law\n\ndoes not concern itself with trifles).\n\n\n\n#2 VOIDIRE\n\n\n\n        Granted that both sides in a trial have peremptory challenges to picking jurors.\n\nHowever, if one goes along with the basic premise that a defendant is innocent until\n\nproven guilty, a concept which is endemic in every international legal edifice, then the\n\nprosecutor should not have the power to strike out potential jurors simply because that\n\njuror is well educated, or has voiced that he/she thinks the Defendant is innocent, etc. A\n\nprosecutor should be severely restricted as to the reasons for striking a juror (such as any\n\nrelationship to the Defendant), and, should be forbidden from asking questions which are\n\nof a \"fishing expedition\" in nature in order to ascertain a juror's state of mind. This\n\nviolates due process. Examples of this can be found in the present case. 2RR22-81\n\n        The jurors which demonstrated a consideration that the Defendant was innocent,\n\nor, any kind of education above high school, or for that matter, any degree of rationality,\n\nwere struck off by the prosecutor.\n\n\n\n#3 GRAND JURY\n\n        The Founding Fathers realized that being accused of a crime and having to go\n\nthrough a trial was a traumatic event. Hence, they came up with the concept of the Grand\n\nJury in order to determine first if the evidence warranted a trial. This is not just some\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\farmchair speculation. Individuals have committed suicide when formally accused of a\n\ncrime even though they were innocent.\n\n       It is also a fact that individuals have been held in custody for over a year, pending\n\ntrial, whereupon they are finally released---after losing their jobs and/or families---for\n\nlack of evidence. In these instances, the prosecutor was playing a game of \"chicken,\"\n\nhoping that the innocent person would plead to a minor sentence, such as probation even\n\nthough there was no evidence against that defendant, i.e., he was innocent. Petitioner met\n\nseveral while incarcerated who were in jail for nearly a year but since they would not\n\n\"crack,\" and there was no evidence against them, they were finally released.\n\n        The concept of the Grand Jury has been perverted by prosecutors. Almost always,\n\nit has been relegated to being a rubber stamp. In the rare instances wherein a Grand Jury\n\nhas gone against the wishes of the prosecutor, the latter has simply convened another\n\nGrand Jury which would give a true bill.\n\n       The Grand Jury that oversaw the presentation of the evidence against the\n\nDefendant should have had an independent advocate to argue, if ever so briefly, why a\n\ntrial should not take place.\n\n        The above problem with Grand Juries violates the    5th   Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution.\n\n\n\n#4MISTRIAL\n\n        A motion for a mistrial was denied by the Court when the Defendant objected to\n\nboth the Prosecutor and Hermosillo mentioning details of the original offence that had\n\noccurred 27 years prior, contrary to the Court's order on August 12, 2011. This order was\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fa result of a Motion for Limine asking the Court to eliminate all mention of that offense\n\nby either the Prosecutor or any of his witnesses. The motion was denied, the Court\n\nremarking that to do so, the law would be effectively nullified; the Court did order to\n\nrestrict the Prosecution from mentioning details, such as the age of the complainant ( 16\n\ny/o) in order to ensure a fair trial. The Court denied the Motion for Mistrial on the\n\ngrounds that the same information was deliberately introduced by stealth by the\n\nprosecutor earlier in a document, and the Defense had not objected then, since the age\n\nhad not been voiced. 3RR79-80 However, said record was never viewed by the jury.\n\n\n\n#5 QUESTIONNAIRE\n\n\n\n       A motion introduced to the Court by the Defendant, prior to the trial beginning, to\n\nadminister a questionnaire to the voi dire candidates was denied. The Court stated that a\n\nquestionnaire was appropriate only for capital cases, and, that some of the questions'\n\nanswers were readily available from the card that the voi dire candidates were to fill out.\n\n2RR11-12\n\n       However, what the Court failed to appreciate is that verbally answering some of\n\nthe questions would evoke a negative emotional reaction, since this trial indirectly\n\ninvolved a sexual offence. Sex offences are universally acknowledged to evoke a\n\nnegative, visceral response. This negative emotion would then become emotional\n\ncontagion and would contaminate the jury pool prior to the trial even starting. This could\n\nbe, and was, exploited by the prosecution for prosecuting the case from the very\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fbeginning, which is what happened. 2RR22-81 In one such instance, a female juror who\n\nhad herself been the victim of sexual assault began to cry loudly. 2RR95\n\n       In addition, experimental evidence exists that actual viewpoints may be admitted\n\nin the privacy of a paper and pencil questionnaire what would not be voiced in public.\n\n\n\n#6 PERJURED TESTIMONY BY TINA HERNANDEZ\n\n\n\n       The Defendant's star witness was a sociopath named Tina Miranda, aka Tina\n\nHernandez, aka Tyna Holmes, aka Tina Ornelas, Tina Wilkins. A habitual, incorrigible\n\ncriminal, she has had convictions for shoplifting, theft of state property, bounced checks\n\n4RR36 and murder 3RR120-123. She described the butchering of her husband as simply\n\n\"domestic violence.\" At the time of her testimony, she had been charged with theft of\n\nelderly ($120,000), for which she subsequently pled guilty and received probation by\n\nJudge Angus (who is presently under investigation for taking bribes). During her cross-\n\nexamination, she denied having shoplifted, in spite of her official criminal record, thereby\n\ncommitting perjury. 3RR121-122 She denied being vindictive towards the Defendant, yet\n\nsimultaneously admitted that the Defendant owed her money and had greatly\n\ninconvenienced her. 3RR125-126\n\n\n\n#7 DESTRUCTION OF EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE & PERJURY BY CURTIS\n\n       HERMOSILLO\n\n       During Defendant's opening statement, Defendant pointed out that officer Curtis\n\nHermosillo, the patrol officer who stopped the Defendant when he was taking his\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fchildren to their school, was scheduled to testify and that Defendant was eagerly awaiting\n\nthe opportunity because days after bonding out he had contacted the chief of the Live\n\nOak Police Department 15RR16-17. In that letter, Defendant asked the chief to preserve\n\nthe tape of the incident with Hermosillo for the future trial, since it clearly showed that\n\nthe officer's subsequent report of Defendant admitting to living in Live Oak was a lie, in\n\nso far as it has Defendant repeatedly informed the officer that he was homeless 6RR66. It\n\nalso showed the officer to have been extremely belligerent and obsessed with the idea\n\nthat the children that he was taking to school (his biological children) were actually\n\nabductees who did not know him.\n\n       Hermosillo was called to the witness stand by the Prosecution. To the Defendant's\n\nastonishment, it was the Prosecution who first raised the issue of the tape. Hermosillo\n\nsaid that the tape had mysteriously malfunctioned, and had malfunctioned in only that\n\nperiod of time involving the incident, not before, not after. 3RR76-77 Throughout, the\n\nwitness' body language was unusual during testimony, sporting a Cheshire-cat grin from\n\near to ear that never left his face. 4RR67-68\n\n       Defendant subsequently called to the stand the abovementioned police chief, who\n\nconfirmed having -received the letter [see item # 4] requesting the preservation of the\n\ntape.3RR165-170 Obviously, the Defendant would not have made this request if the tape\n\ncorroborated Hermosillo's testimony; it would have been damning. Additionally, a letter\n\nof complaint sent to the Live Oak Police Department by the complainant was responded\n\nto, wherein Lt. Malone cites the precise time (in seconds) that the incident took place,\n\nwhich would strongly indicate that he was timing the video for that much accuracy [see\n\nSecond Appendix].\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\f       The destruction of exculpatory evidence is a long-standing, cherished, tradition\n\namong both prosecutors and law enforcement personnel and we have in this case a prime\n\nexample. It is a patently obvious conclusion that the tape was erased in order to achieve a\n\nconviction of the Defendant. Only someone who is determined to confirm the\n\nDefendant's conviction could possibly conclude otherwise, and, it speaks volumes of\n\nhow contaminated had the jury's mind become that something so obvious was ignored.\n\n\n\n#8 THE OVERBREADTH DOCTRINE\n\n\n\n       The law, as it now stands, is one size fits all. \"Sex offender\" is not only a\n\nmisnomer in that it implies that the recipient of this label is actively engaging in sexual\n\nperversions, but it is an absurd catchall term. No practical differentiations are made for\n\nthe different types of behaviors that fall under this catchall category, although both\n\ncommon sense, and professional judgments, acknowledges that there is a tremendous gulf\n\nbetween the different categories of \"sex offenders.\" However, the law makes no such\n\ndistinction and treats a 19 y/o who has a consensual sex with his 16 y/o girlfriend (and\n\nsubsequently marry) the same as a serial rapist, the same as an exhibitionist, the same as a\n\ncollege student who got drunk at a party and briefly grabbed a female's breast, the same\n\nas a serial pedophile, the same as someone who has had one offence in 30 years, the same\n\nas one who has had a dozen rapes in the past year the same as a child killer. They are all\n\nsubjected to the same restrictions in parole and probation and in registration. Just as a\n\nperson may not receive the death penalty for stealing a chocolate bar from a store as he\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fwould if he was a serial killer, the same law should not apply to all so-called \"sex\n\noffenders.\"\n\n        In the past decade, the United States Supreme Court has heard several cases\n\nchallenging sex offender registries. Carr v. US. 560 U.S. 438, 130 S. Ct. 2229; Reynolds\n\nv. US. 132 S.Ct. 975; Smith v. Doe 538 U.S. 84, 123 S.Ct. 1140; US. v. Kebodeaux 133\n\nS.Ct. 2496; US. v. Comstock 560 U.S. 126,130 S. Ct. 1949. Throughout these cases, the\n\nfollowing terms have been used interchangeably, without distinction or even accuracy:\n\nsex offenders, sexual predators, child abusers, dangerous sex offenders, child sex\n\noffenders, child kidnappers, sexually dangerous persons, pedophiles, child molesters,\n\nviolent sex offenders, sexual abusers of children, persons who, due to a mental illness are\n\nsexually dangerous. The same indiscriminate use can be found in the fifty states, both in\n\nand outside of courtrooms, whereupon Petitioner asks: is an exhibitionist really a\n\n\"sexually dangerous person\"? Is a teenager having consensual sex with his girlfriend\n\nwhile on their 8th date \"a child molester\"? In fact, even two persons convicted of Sexual\n\nAssault may have different offenses yet both be labeled identically as being violent: one\n\nis a brutal rapist the other having consensual sex with a sexually active teenager, yet both\n\nare seen as rapists.\n\n        To make differentiations in sex offenders and thereby     as~ess   requirements and\n\npunishments differently, can be very irritating to those persons on a fanatical vendetta, or\n\nwho are prone to rigidly view things as black or white, yes-or-no categories, or who are\n\nalarmists who see sex offenders in every corner.\n\n        Pedophilia and rape are heinous crimes. No one is arguing otherwise. But, to\n\ninsist that all of the above are equivalent is to have myopic vision, or to be a fanatic. In\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\ffact, sometimes even legally in the original offence an important distinction is made: in\n\ncertain instances, exposing oneself is a misdemeanor, not a felony, e.g., Tristan v. State\n\n393 SW 3d 806; nonetheless, such offences are lumped together with serial pedophiles.\n\n       Furthermore, the restrictions imposed on \"sex offenders\" by the parole and\n\nprobation bureaucracies, as occurred in the present instance, are unquestionably punitive.\n\nIn Carr v. US, Reynolds v. US., Smith v. Doe, and US v. Kebodeaux v. Comstock,\n\nsupra, there are the usual threadbare platitudes that the restrictions are for the protection\n\nof the public, though it is never explained how, exactly, are they so. For example, how\n\nexactly is not being allowed to express one's religion during holidays a deterrent to\n\ncrime? Petitioner does not know the answer and has never been enlightened.\n\nAdditionally, in the deliberation of Kebodeaux, supra, it is even mentioned that the\n\nconditions of parole and probation are for the purpose of rehabilitation and that they deter\n\ncrime, but how is not being able to be with one's one children a deterrent to crime, and\n\nhow is having to ask permission of a parole bureaucrat in order to establish a romantic\n\nrelationship rehabilitative? Not being a licensed attorney, Petitioner would love to learn.\n\n       Only someone who has not been listed in a sex offender registry could claim that\n\nthere are no punitive consequences. Yet, all of the above, wide-varying \"sex offenders\"\n\nhave to endure the same fate. In fact, the Alaskan Sex Offender Registry Act (SORA)\n\nSmith v. Doe, supra) includes child kidnappers as \"sex offenders\" even though this\n\ninclusion could apply to parents feuding over custody of their children.\n\n       Incidentally, the Athenian lawgiver, Draco, decreed that stealing a head of\n\ncabbage merited the death penalty (Plutarch, Lives), hence the term \"draconian.\" His\n\nfellow Athenians objected, stating that that was the same punishment for murder. Draco,\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\ftoo, had a rationale worthy of an American court of appeals: he stated that death was the\n\nappropriate punishment for stealing a head of cabbage, but unfortunately Nature had not\n\nallowed for a worse punishment for murderers. That kind of mentality, it seems, is alive\n\nand well when it comes to the present matter.\n\n\n\n#9 THE LAW IS UN-CONSTITUTIONAL\n\n\n\n       It is universally acknowledged that an accusation, to say nothing of a conviction,\n\nof a sexual offence is highly inflammatory, one which elicits a very strong emotional\n\nreaction. Consequently, is there anyone who is so obtuse as to believe or claim that a\n\nDefendant can obtain a fair trial when the first words that fall out of a prosecutor's mouth\n\nare, \"The Defendant is a convicted sex offender\"? A jury is thereby strongly prejudiced\n\nagainst the Defendant before the trial even starts. A fair trial is impossible and is thus a\n\nviolation of a fundamental right. Saldana v. State, 70 SW3d 873.\n\n       The indictment was Failure to Report a Change of Address. 2RR109-110 The\n\njudge informed the potential jurors during voi dire that the Defendant had a prior\n\nconviction for Sexual Assault 2RR16-17.\n\n       It is a cornerstone of the law that any previous offence should not be presented to\n\na jury during a trial so that the jurors' evaluation of the evidence not be tainted. There\n\nmust be no bias in the jury in order to have a fair trial as guaranteed under the Sixth\n\nAmendment---as well as the due process section of both the Fifth and 14th\n\nAmendments. This is particularly the case when the previous offense is one that is\n\nemotionally explosive, as in a sex case. This case conclusively proves, as possibly no\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fother case could, that the Defendant could absolutely not obtain a fair trial under this law\n\nsince he was previously convicted, even though there was a complete lack of hard,\n\nobjective, evidence---none, absolutely none---as to his having established another\n\nresidence.\n\n       The Defendant noted in the trial that the change in attitude towards him before\n\nand after the information about the Sexual Assault charge was instantly noticeable, and\n\nhostile. This was evident in the voi dire phase 2RR85-86. It was evident in the closing\n\nargument 4RR74, when one juror, for example kept his face averted ninety degrees away\n\nwhile Defendant spoke. One juror who had been herself a victim of sexual assault began\n\nto cry loudly during the voi dire phase. 2RR95\n\n\n\n#10 INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE\n\n\n\n       The evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for failing to register a\n\nchange of address as required by the sex offender registration program because the State\n\nfailed to prove that Appellant intended to change addresses. Green v. State, 350 S.W.3d\n\n617 (Tex.Crim.App-Houst. [14th Dist], 2011, pet refd); Tex. Code Crim. Pro.\n\n62.055(a). The evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for failing to register a\n\nchange of address as required by the sex offender registration program because the State\n\nfailed to prove that Appellant had actually changed addresses. Tex. Code Crim. Pro.\n\n62.055(a). The evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for failing to register a\n\nchange of address as required by the sex offender registration program because the\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fevidence actually supports that Appellant was m compliance with the registration\n\nrequirements. Tex. Code Crim. Pro. 62.055(i).\n\n       It is ironic that some of the Prosecution's own witnesses corroborated the fact\n\nthat the Defendant had no residence. The Prosecution tried through verbal legerdemain to\n\nimply that the issue was whether the Defendant was intending to move, but the\n\nindictment reads quite clearly that the Defendant had moved to a new residence and had\n\nnot reported the change of address [see item# 5] and Article 62.055 of the Texas Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure is quite clear on this. To this day, Defendant would like to know\n\nwhere, exactly, did he move to. No objective, hard, evidence was produced to prove the\n\nState's case: there was no lease, no photographs, no DNA, no checks, no bills, no change\n\nof address forms, no landlord, no address. Nothing. The Defendant never truly violated\n\nthe law, but he was convicted simply because he was labeled a \"sex offender.\" At no\n\npoint did the prosecutor provide an address where the Defendant was supposedly living\n\nin. Furthermore, a car is not a residence; electric power cannot be installed, nor a\n\nrefrigerator, bed, or television, or sofa; nor can he receive mail, unless the mailman\n\nchances upon him and tries to chase him down while driving. And the address given by\n\nMr. Hermosillo turned out to be nonexistent, one that was concocted by him on the spur\n\nofthe moment 3RR73, 83.\n\n       Insufficiency of evidence was used as the principal argument for appeal by the\n\ncourt-appointed appeal attorney, even though the Petitioner was forcefully insisting on\n\nciting the same arguments as in this writ. Not surprisingly, the 4th Court of Appeals cited-\n\n--as usual---the Calvinistic Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61\n\nLeD. 2d 560 for not wanting to overturn the conviction. The Jackson v. Virginia case is\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fconstantly being utilized by the various courts of appeal of various states in order to\n\navoid their responsibility. In the denial, the   4th   Court of Appeals stated that, \"Under that\n\nstandard, we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict whether\n\nany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"\n\n       Yes, by all means, let us review all of the evidence.\n\n       In the Court of first instance, the State's case rested principally on the testimony\n\nof two individuals. Curtis Hermosillo claimed that in mid-December Petitioner lived at a\n\nparticular address---which turned out does not exist. Tina Omelas---a habitual criminal\n\nguilty of everything from fraud and theft to shoplifting and murder---claimed that\n\nPetitioner had moved out in mid-November. Now, if one were to look at the\n\nprosecution's evidence, and only at the prosecution's evidence---without even so much as\n\nlooking at the cross-examination---then one would, of course, agree that the weight of the\n\nevidence is on the side of the State.\n\n       But, if we also include the cross-examination, the defense witnesses and the\n\ndefense's evidence, i.e., if we truly include ALL of the evidence, then it becomes a totally\n\ndifferent matter.\n\n        In regards to Hermosillo, the facts that Petitioner asked the Live Oak police chief\n\nto preserve the tape wherein Petitioner explained to Hermosillo he was homeless, that this\n\nwas confirmed by the police chief, Hermosillo's mocking demeanor in Court, that the\n\nDefendant in his opening statement stated he was looking forward to presenting the tape\n\nwhich was objective proof of his innocence, that it was the prosecutor who first brought\n\nup the tape, and, that the said tape mysteriously \"malfunctioned\" only for those crucial 15\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fminutes according to his testimony, then Hermosillo's testimony appears to be rotten,\n\nrotten to the core, as befits a \"bad cop.\"\n\n       And then there is the testimony of Tina Ornelas (or Hernandez) who was, and\n\nremains, a verified sociopath, who committed peljury on the stand, and who admitted that\n\nPetitioner owed her money and had greatly inconvenienced her. Now, a convicted felon's\n\nword is always suspect in any State. Carson v. Gomez, 14 SW 3d 778, rehearing\n\noverruled, review denied, certiorari denied 121 S. Ct. 807, 531 U.S. 1088, 148 LeD 2d\n\n693. However, if it helps to convict a Defendant, it seems then that the testimony of a\n\nfelon is reliable. But, if it helps to exonerate a Defendant, then a felon's testimony is\n\ndeemed worthless. Incidentally, this unfair prejudice is similar to a mother's or a wife's\n\ntestimony.\n\n        Additionally, in using Jackson v. Virginia as a crutch, the 4th Court of Appeals\n\narbitrarily discounted the testimony of Petitioner's ex-wife for incomprehensible reasons.\n\nSimon v. State, supra: \"Although Simon told Officer Allen that he had separated from\n\nTelly and was living in his car at a parking lot, which also was supported by Telly's\n\ntestimony, the jury could have disbelieved that evidence and, instead, believed that\n\nSimon was residing at the residence on Rimwood.\" In other words, the habitual criminal\n\nmust be believed, but the honest citizen should be disbelieved. Anything to affirm the\n\nconviction of a \"sex offender.\"\n\n        Furthermore, there is the matter of non-evidence as evidence: the prosecutor did\n\nnot provide any hard, objective, evidence that showed Petitioner living in another\n\nresidence: a lease signed by him, a change of address form, utility bills, DNA,\n\nphotographs, a moving van contract, a landlord. Nothing.\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f       Lastly, generally speaking, there is an elephant in the [court]room that everyone\n\nevades, is rarely whispered about much less mentioned out loud. Like the proverbial\n\nelephant in the room, everyone knows of it, tiptoes around it, but is afraid to openly\n\nacknowledge its existence: to put it crudely, it is that jurors can be stupid. This statement\n\nmay appear as distasteful, as offensive, as vulgar, and so it may be, but it is also\n\nunquestionably true and everyone knows it. Every judge, every lawyer, on many\n\noccasions, has been faced with a verdict that defied all reason, all comprehension, all\n\nevidence, which is why so many attorneys are averse to a jury trial, civil or criminal.\n\nInstead, Courts pretend that the people dragged off the street to serve in the jury are, one\n\nand all, rational, intelligent, and even well versed in the law, whereas experience\n\noccasionally proves otherwise. The irony, of course, is that when one of these same\n\npotential jurors is chanced on the street, that same judge or attorney may denigrate that\n\nperson's IQ or rationality. Yet, Jackson v. Virginia, supra, ensures finality with the\n\nassumption that a person, simply by being placed in a jury box will be automatically\n\nimproved in logic and rationality and will experience a sharp rise in IQ. Quite simply,\n\ncourts of appeal rely on Jackson v. Virginia as an excuse to avoid making difficult\n\ndecisions. The instant case before the Court, however, does not require making a difficult\n\ndecision at all as to sufficiency of evidence.\n\n       The present case illustrates the above m that Petitioner was convicted on a\n\nscintilla of evidence. There was more than a reasonable doubt present in the case. Indeed,\n\nthe dearth of evidence against him underscores the fact that the jury was prejudiced by\n\nannouncement of defendant's previous conviction and present legal standing (i.e., being\n\nlabeled as a \"sex offender\").\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f#11 BILL OF ATTAINDER\n\n       The Constitution bans bills of attainder, whether they are directed against an\n\nindividual person or against a group of people (Hamilton, Alexander, The Federalist\n\nPapers (#84), Mentor Books, 1961). The sex offender registration act of Texas, and for\n\nthat matter of all the states, achieves that status and, as such, it is un-Constitutional.\n\nAlthough the law was originally intended as a safeguard for the public, the unintended\n\nconsequences have subsequently transformed it into a bill of attainder. Objections to the\n\nlaw cannot be waved aside simply by stating that the original intent of the law was non-\n\npunitive. The drug thalidomide was never intended to have deleterious effects, but the\n\nundeniable fact is that taking the drug led to birth defects. No one has ever claimed that\n\nthe birth defects did not take place, or did not exist, yet persons who defend the sex\n\noffender registrations absurdly claim that the deleterious effects do not exist simply\n\nbecause the original intent of the law was not punitive.\n\n       The posting the identity and address of individuals who have been labeled \"sex\n\noffenders\" have resulted in well-documented acts of vandalism against such individuals;\n\nIt has also led to de facto segregation into mini-ghettos (Levenson, Jill & Cotter, Leo.\n\n(2005) The impact of sex offender residence restrictions: 1,000 feet from danger or one\n\nstep from absurd?

As such, it is a type of incarceration albeit very mild by\n\ncomparison, but incarceration nonetheless. It has also led to restrictions on employment.\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fPetitioner himself has been evicted several times from decent apartments when it became\n\nknown through the official website that he was \"a registered sex offender,\" so that he has\n\nhad to live in a series of squalid places of residence although he has---not yet---been\n\nforced to live under a bridge, as has happened with some individuals. In a sense, it is a\n\ntype of incarceration.\n\n       In the trial, Officer Allen admitted of being aware such occurrences 3RR60-61\n\nand when Petitioner was homeless even the Salvation Army residence for homeless\n\npeople would not accept him in the middle of a very cold winter because he was a\n\nregistered \"sex offender\" 3RR60-61. It has also led to social ostracism. This occurs even\n\nthough his sole sexual offence was 30 years ago, and even though he \"paid his debt to\n\nsociety,\" he continues to be punished. Fleming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 80 S. Ct. 136T\n\n(Justice Douglas dissenting): \"By smiting a man day after day with slanderous words, by\n\ntaking away his opportunity to earn a living, you can drain the blood from his veins\n\nwithout even scratching his skin. 'Todays' bill of attainder is broader than the classic\n\nform, and not so tall and sharp. There is mental in place of physical torture and\n\nconfiscation oftomorrow's bread and butter instead of yesterday's land and gold. What is\n\nperfectly clear is that hate, fear and prejudice play the same role today, in the destruction\n\nof human rights in America that they did in England when a frenzied mob of lords,\n\njudges, bishops and shoemakers turned the Titus Oates blacklist into a hangman's\n\nrecord.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\f#12 CONDITIONS OF PROBATION & PAROLE ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\n\n\n       Upon denial of the Petition for Discretionary Review, Defendant had turned\n\nhimself in to the local agency of adult supervision. At that point, the staff was not aware\n\nthat Defendant was now in their case load. Nonetheless, he was given a set of rules the\n\nfollowing day, February 12, 2013, specifically tailored to sex offenders. [see item # 6]\n\nThe offence for which Petitioner was found guilty was a nonsexual offence, yet he was\n\nput on restrictions that are typical of someone convicted of a sex offence. Note that in\n\nTamez v. State, 534 SW 2d 686; Johnson v. State, 672 SW 2d 621; US. v. Mills, 959 F.\n\n2d 516 and Simpson v. State 772 SW 2d 276 the higher Courts in Texas have ordained\n\nthat conditions of probation must be specifically relevant to the offence.\n\n       When he was placed on parole in January 2014, he was given identically harsh\n\nrestrictions and was furthermore placed on an ankle monitor, so that someone aware of\n\nhis conditions and of his monitor would have concluded that he was an extremely\n\ndangerous criminal, a serial killer perhaps, instead of being guilty of a victimless,\n\nadministrative, bureaucratic offence, akin to the tearing off of the tag from a mattress.\n\n       And regardless of his present circumstances now, this issue must be addressed.\n\nFirst, as happened before, the same restrictions can be arbitrarily imposed at any time, for\n\nany reason (and only someone who has been under the thumb of parole officers or\n\nprobation officers can attest to their self-righteous arrogance). Secondly, if and when he\n\nis placed back on parole, he will have the same restrictions as before due to his being \"a\n\nconvicted sex offender.\" And since his sentence has already expired halfway, it is\n\nbeneficial to deal with the topic now instead of waiting for the imposition of the\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\frestrictions; since the courts move at a glacial pace his sentence would be finished by the\n\ntime that the Court of Appeals, or the Criminal Court of Appeals (or, conceivably, even\n\nthe trial Court) came to a decision on the matter.\n\n       Among the requirements were the following:\n\n       K. Defendant may not establish a romantic relationship without the approval of\n\nthe Probation Officer (PO).\n\n       U. Abide by all \"Holiday Notice\" rules. These were verbally explained to the\n\nDefendant to be a prohibition against displaying religious ornaments and signs which\n\ncould be visible from outside the home. Presumably, signs stating \"Jesus has Risen,\" or,\n\n\"Happy Easter\" during Easter, and \"Merry Christmas,\" or \"Peace on Earth\" during\n\nDecember would simply be too attractive to children, who would then gravitate in droves\n\nto the sex offender's home, thereby becoming potential victims.\n\n       I (a) Defendant may not own a computer which does not have internet access. The\n\nirony, of course, is that a computer not having internet access has no access to internet\n\npornographic sites. Likewise, Defendant may not use a public library's computer, even\n\nthough, again ironically, they are blocked from such similar sites.\n\n       Said restrictions violate Defendant's constitutional right of freedom of religious\n\nexpression and worship, freedom of assembly and, freedom of the press, all found in the\n\nFirst Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\n       Approximately a week afterwards Parole Officer Franco Olvera went to\n\nDefendant's apartment, did not find him there at the time, called him, and ultimately\n\nordered him to return from Walmart, where Defendant had been grocery shopping, and\n\nmeet him at his residence. Upon entering and doing a thorough inspection of the\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fpremises, Mr. Olvera concluded that defendant was not living there. This conclusion was\n\nbased on (a) there was dirt in places inside the apartment (b) there were few groceries and\n\neating utensils (c) there were cobwebs inside the bathtub. When pressed for an answer,\n\nDefendant admitted that he had been shopping for food and plastic utensils that had run\n\nout, that he usually ate at fast food places that had \"dollar menus.\" He also admitted to\n\nbabysitting his biological children when they returned from school and helping them with\n\ntheir homework (they are straight-A students) while their mother worked and attended\n\ncollege, as well as instilling in them respect for their mother and their teachers. In\n\nexchange, defendant could take a hot shower and have a snack in their home, since his\n\nown shower was defective and had not been repaired by the landlord despite repeated\n\nrequests.\n\n       At this point, it must be mentioned that Petitioner lived in a \"dump.\" Exceedingly\n\nfew landlords will rent to sex offenders to the point that some are even forced out to be\n\nhomeless and to live under bridges, or, just simply decide to disappear and go\n\nunderground, whereupon they lead a relatively normal life. Those landlords that do rent\n\nalmost always do so in disreputable neighborhoods, sometimes in decrepit dwellings. In a\n\nsense, \"sex offenders\" are relegated to mini-ghettos. Items # 14 & 15 are pictures of\n\nwhere the Petitoner was living and evicted from once it became known of his legal status\n\nthrough the registry. Items# 16 & 17 are pictures of where he has/is being forced to live.\n\n       Approximately on March 6, 2013, Petitioner was summoned to the PO's office. A\n\nreport had been forwarded to the Court in the interim of which Defendant was not\n\ninformed and, therefore, could not give his version of the visit. In retaliation for not\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fhaving enough grocenes at home, having a dirty apartment and taking showers\n\nelsewhere, additional, harsh, penalties were imposed, to wit, [see item # 7]\n\n       ---prohibition against having any contact with his biological children,\n\n       ---attend a \"sex offender treatment program,\" even though for many years he\n\nattended said program while on parole,\n\n       ---periodically submit to polygraph examinations,\n\n       ---avoid places where children might congregate,\n\n       This could be considered to be a violation of the much neglected 9th\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, an amendment which, paradoxically, is\n\noften overlooked in legal matters precisely because it is not specific in enumerating\n\nConstitutional rights, which in this particular instance could be construed as the right to\n\nmaintain familial integrity (although there are other interpretations; cf. Randy Barnett,\n\n\"The Ninth Amendment: It Means What It Says,\" Texas Law Review, 85, 2006).\n\n       Petitioner has tried very hard to be a productive, beneficial, influence in his\n\nchildren's lives, particularly in their schoolwork, and they are one of the few joys that are\n\nleft to him. Furthermore, said restriction penalized the children, who found the sudden\n\nseparation to be traumatic; not only was such a separation detrimental to their emotional\n\nstate of mind, but it was also detrimental from a scholastic standpoint (the punitive aspect\n\nof sex offender registration on \"sex offenders\"' families is a known fact: Levenson, Jill &\n\nTewksbury, Richard. (2007) Collateral damage: family members of registered sex\n\noffenders. American Journal of Criminal Justice, 34, 54-68; item# 11). Incidentally, an\n\nautomatic investigation of the children by the Child Protective Services was instituted,\n\nthanks to Mr. Olvera. The caseworker, Nadene Long, found no evidence of neglect or\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\fabuse; instead, she found the children to be highly intelligent and healthy, highly\n\nmotivated towards school and respectful of parents and teachers, and aware of what\n\nmeasures to take in case of emergencies. She considered the referral to have been a waste\n\nof her time. It is difficult to reconcile the rationale for this separation of children from\n\ntheir father as a result of the father not having enough groceries in his apartment at the\n\ntime, or having cobwebs in his bathtub. Not to mention irrelevant to the original charge\n\nof failure to register.\n\n        As to the polygraph, two points need be made. One, it is an obvious violation of\n\nthe 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution, against self-incrimination. Two,\n\non the other hand, the results of a polygraph examination can be, and have been, used\n\npunitively by the State in order to incarcerate a person (Marcum v. State, 983 SW 2d 762;\n\nLeonard v. State, 385 SW 3d 570). Four, proof that the polygraph's intent is simply\n\npunitive and judicial is the fact that no therapist is hired by the State who does not agree\n\nto include the mandatory polygraph as part of its \"therapy,\" even though there is a wide\n\nplethora of types of therapies. Lastly, polygraphs are notoriously unreliable.\n\n        In regards to the rule of avoiding places where children might congregate, the\n\nregulation is absurdly vague since children can be found in the sidewalks, in the malls, in\n\nthe parks, in the libraries, in downtown, in movies, in McDonald's, in Wendy's, in Pizza\n\nHut, in museums, in theaters, in Whataburger, in Taco Cabana, in pet stores, in clothing\n\nshops, in ice cream shops, in yogurt shops, in Starbucks, in planetariums, in Sea World,\n\nin Six Flags, in lakes, in football games, in baseball games, in hockey games, in\n\nbasketball games, in sport stores, etc. Ironically, the only place where children would not\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\fbe found would be in stripper clubs and shops that sell pornography, neither place being\n\nof interest or intent to patronize by Petitioner.\n\n        Lastly, Petitioner has a long history of carrying out scientific research and of\n\ninvolvement in literary endeavors [see item # 10]. To this end, he requires the use of\n\ncomputers, which are ubiquitous and almost mandatory for these purposes: e-mails and\n\nsubmissions to journal and book publishers, for example. Also, the computer is also used\n\nfor storing information, collating, and as a document creation. Restriction of use would\n\nviolate his 1st Amendment right. Furthermore, restriction on the use of computers\n\nhobbled Defendant in the preparation of the original writ, in so far as he was unable to\n\nobtain legal documents, ask legal opinions, thereby violating his rights under the 5th, 6th\n\nand 14th Amendments.\n\n        In January 2014, Petitioner was placed on parole. He received the same\n\nrestrictions as those above with the additional increase in: (1) inability to attend church\n\nservices due to mandatory \"lockdown\" during weekends, thereby violating his\n\nConstitutional right to religious worship (2) he was placed on ankle monitor and his\n\nmovements restricted and monitored (3) he was forbidden to enter libraries, bookstores\n\nand movie theaters, thereby violating the   1st   Amendment. Furthermore, he was forbidden\n\nto see movies in movie theaters at any time, again violating his     1st   Amendment rights.\n\nObjections were arrogantly ignored by the parole bureaucrats, as usual.\n\n        Even should Petitioner find himself not on parole or probation, this ground is still\n\napplicable in this writ since he can have those conditions imposed on him on any future\n\ninstance of probation and/or parole.\n\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\f#13 CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT\n\n\n\n       The standard for the     8th   Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual\n\npunishment is twofold: (1) either a punishment was considered cruel and unusual at the\n\ntime of the Bill of Rights compilation, or, (2) it is inconsistent with modem day\n\nstandards. Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 405, 106 S. Ct. 2595, 91 Le D 2d 335.\n\nPetitioner believes that both instances apply here.\n\n       At cursory glance, it may seem strange to claim that Petitioner received cruel and\n\nunusual punishment in this case. However, going to prison for two years for supposedly\n\nhaving changed addresses without notification for three weeks is, indeed, cruel and\n\nunusual punishment. There was no one victimized; there was no loss of money, no\n\nembezzlement, no counterfeiting; no arson; there was no loss of property or damage to\n\nproperty; there were no drugs involved, no use, transportation, selling, or manufacturing.\n\nFurthermore, at no point did the Petitioner try to drop under the radar and go\n\nunderground, which would have been easy; he tried to keep to the law by contacting\n\nOfficer Allen; instead of being given kudos for trying to keep to the letter of the law, at a\n\nstressful period in his life, he was instead arrested and charged with a felony.\n\n       Additionally, although it may furthermore appear to the uninitiated that being on\n\nprobation is a mild form of punishment, it can be seen from the above that the special\n\nharsh restrictions imposed on \"sex offenders\" are actually cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nPractically every one of the Constitutional rights in the Bill of Rights has been negated\n\nhere. Incarcerated prisoners have a greater degree of protection of their Constitutional\n\nrights than the Petitioner had during probation or parole! No matter how the State spins it,\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\feither in the form of a parole bureaucrat, or of counsel for the State, being deprived of so\n\nmany Constitutional rights is cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       The sex offender registry law is conducive to cruel and unusual punishment on\n\nthree levels. On one level, the range of punishment is excessive for what is, as has been\n\nstated so many times in this petition, for all intents and purpose, an administrative,\n\nvictimless crime. This is particularly so if the period of non-registration is a matter of\n\ndays or weeks and not years.\n\n       On a second level, the registry law serves as a peg for attaching other, additional\n\nlaws that are themselves most certainly punitive in that they restrict a person's liberty\n\nmore and more by increments. Using the registry as a basis, local and state government\n\nentities have passed laws stating that anyone found in those registries may not rent\n\ndomiciles, may not enter certain tax-supported public properties, live in certain\n\nneighborhoods, utilize certain public services, etc. (Petitioner, for example, was fined in\n\n2012 for picking up his son from a swimming pool after swimming lessons because of a\n\nLive Oak municipal law). At times it seems as if communities are in a competition as to\n\nwhich one will be the most innovative or pass the more restrictions. For all intents and\n\npurpose they are bills of attainder attached to a sex offender registry bill of attainder. As\n\nusual, these additional laws are passed with a preamble that they are for the purpose of\n\nensuring public safety, but the effect is indisputably punitive and, if honestly admitted,\n\nwere also intended that way. The thalidomide birth defects did take place.\n\n        Just as a member of an audience will cringe at watching a Chinese contortionist,\n\nso has Petitioner cringed at reading the elaborate verbal contortions to deny ex post facto\n\nstatus to sex offender registries, e.g., Smith v. Doe, supra; Reynolds v. U S. Writing a\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\fconcurring opinion, Justice Souter in the former nevertheless cites his misgivings: \"The\n\nfact that the Act uses past crime as the touchstone, probably sweeping in a significant\n\nnumber of people who pose no real threat to the community, serves to feed suspicion that\n\nsomething more than regulation of safety is going on; when a legislature uses prior\n\nconvictions to impose burdens that outpace the law's stated civil aims, there is room for\n\nserious argument that the ulterior purpose is to revisit past crimes, not prevent future\n\nones.\" Petitioner would suggest that if there is any question as to the real punitive basis\n\nfor sex offender registries---not to mention all the other legal restrictions pegged on to the\n\nSORAs---then one only has to listen to the hatred in the voices of those persons\n\nintroducing, or supporting, said legislations. And the Court should furthermore consider\n\nthe following: Statute 103.001 was enacted to give a financial compensation for those\n\nwrongly convicted of a crime; among its provisions is a separate one that allows financial\n\ncompensation for those who, because of a wrongful conviction, have had to report to a\n\nsex offender registry, which begs the question: if being in a sex offender registry is not\n\npunitive then why did the State legislature legislate financial compensation? The answer\n\nis obvious: because being in such a registry is punitive.\n\n       Incidentally, someone with verbal virtuosity could easily form a preamble to a\n\nlaw that amputates a jaywalker's legs, or cuts off a thief s hands, and make it sound as if\n\nthe law was not punitive, but simply for the protection of the public.\n\n       Another question that demands an answer is: if the safety of the public is really\n\nthe issue, why are there no registries for convicted thieves, or convicted murderers?\n\nIndeed, how is a statutory \"rapist\" or an exhibitionist more dangerous than a murderer?\n\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\f       On the third level is the matter of having his Constitutional rights being thrown\n\nout the window through the conditions of parole and probation. How is being prohibited\n\nfrom being with his own children not cruel and unusual punishment? Again, not being a\n\nlicensed attorney, Petitioner would dearly love to learn.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n       To reiterate the obvious, (true) sexual molestation of a child, and rape of an adult,\n\nare both heinous crimes that must be punished and should be punished harshly. No one is\n\narguing otherwise. But frequently, what passes as \"sex offenders\" are persons who have\n\nnot committed either offense, yet are treated and classified as if they had.\n\n       Additionally, granted that the above offenses occur, no one can deny that the\n\ncountry has gone through a hysteria in regards to sex offenses, said hysteria exacerbated\n\nby the mass media, particularly whenever a particularly lurid offence occurs, so that\n\nrational thinking has dissipated in this climate over this topic (Mary Pride, The Child\n\nAbuse Industry, Crossway Books, 1986).\n\n       Again, this case conclusively illustrates, as probably few others could, that being\n\nannounced to the jury at the very beginning of a trial as a \"sex offender\" guarantees a\n\nguilty verdict---regardless of the lack of evidence. \"Sentence first---verdict afterwards,\"\n\nis the motto in the courtroom in Alice in Wonderland and should be formally appended to\n\nthis law. All a prosecutor has to do in order to ensure a conviction is utter three words:\n\n\"convicted sex offender.\" This flaw is inherent in the law itself, by denying the\n\nDefendant a fair trial and is, therefore, ipso facto, un-Constitutional. \"Society wins not\n\nonly when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair; our system of the\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\fadministration of justice suffers when any accused          IS   treated unfairly.\" Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373, U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194.\n\n       Then, the question of finality comes into play here as well. In regards to habeas\n\ncorpus, for example, the matter of exhausted and unexhausted claims, as well as \"mixed .\n\npetitions, was ultimately resolved with the principal concern of the Courts achieving\n\nfinality. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, Ill s. Ct. 2546. Likewise, AEDPA was\n\ninstituted for the purpose of finality. Doe v. Menefee, 391 F. 3d 147. And, similarly, a\n\ndefendant cannot be retried for the same offense that an appeal court has vacated and\n\nremanded due to insufficiency of evidence, again, for the sake of achieving finality.\n\nGreene v. Massey,_437 U. S. 19, 98 S .Ct. 2151. But, for so-called \"sex offenders\" there\n\nis no finality. The punishments keep coming and coming in new and novel ways, long\n\nafter the original law was passed and time served. Every convicted \"sex offender\" is\n\nSisyphus.\n\n       Lastly, well-documented instances of vigilante acts have occurred from time to\n\ntime against persons who were found to be living in a community, as a result of there\n\nbeing a sex offender registry, and that is on top of numerous local bills of attainder.\n\n       As a result, thousands of individuals who have been labeled as a \"sex offender\"\n\nand who paid their debt to society, have made the rational choice to go underground and\n\nassume a different identity since they feel that society has made living a normal law-\n\nabiding life to be an impossibility. And why should they not do so? It is so simple. By\n\ntaking a few elementary precautions and assuming a new identity, a person does not have\n\nto live under a bridge exposed to the elements, or live in a dump where he will be forever\n\nsubject to persecution by all and sundry. To conform to what is demanded is simply\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\fabsurd, a no-win scenario. In this regard, it is amusing, in a perverse way, to read the\n\ninterpretations as to why so many thousands have \"disappeared\" when the high courts\n\nhave discussed SORAs, e.g., in Carr v. US., supra; Reynolds v. U S., supra; U S. v.\n\nKebodeaux, supra. The implied reason by the justices has been simply delusional as to\n\nwhy they dropped out of sight: that they have done so in order to commit additional\n\ncrimes---as if being in a registry somehow eliminates the impulse to commit a crime.\n\nThose defenders of registries have the delusional fantasy that \"sex offenders\" who have\n\navoided registration are now lurking around comers and in shadows everywhere looking\n\nfor victims. In reality, they are now living ordinary, mundane, boring, law-abiding lives.\n\nFinally.\n\n           And, in the end, Petitioner is faced with the uncomfortable question: why, indeed,\n\nshould he not also simply go underground, disappear, and thereby lead a normal, stress-\n\nfree, mundane otherwise law-abiding life? It would be so easy. The truth of the matter is\n\nthat, try as he might, he cannot think of a good, rational reason.\n\n\n\n           WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner prays for relief from the\n\nCourt. Specifically, Petitioner asks the Court to: (1) void and nullify his conviction (2)\n\ndeclare the law to be un-Constitutional and thereby null and void it (3) reform the Grand\n\nJury process (4) limit the prosecution's voi dire questioning in all future trials for all\n\nDefendants, and, (5) declare the special conditions of parole and probation that pertain to\n\nall \"sex offenders\" to be un-Constitutional and thereby null and void them (6) order that\n\nPetitioner not have to register in the sex offender registry.\n\n\n\n\n                                               39\n\f                               I certify that the above is an accurate and correct version of the facts and that a\n\n                  copy has been sent to the State via regular mail.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              211 E.

She believes that the law itself can be challenged\n Constitutionally on the basis that it makes no provision as to categories of\n \"sex offenders.\" It lumps together an 18 y/o who had consensual sex with his\n girlfiend along with a habitual child rapist/killer together with someone who\n was drunk and urinated in a secluded spot and was seen and tagged as an\n exhibitionist along with a habitual rapist. I, personally, do not see the\n Constitutional basis for such a challenge. However, I can see how the original\n term of \"sexual assault\" is a misnomer when the sex was described as consensual\n between myself and a teenage girl 28 years ago and could conceivably be brought\n into play. Your thoughts?\n >\n > In regards to the transcript:\n >\n > (a) I f\n memory serves, I believe that there is a sentence or two that is missing in\n Officer Hermosillo's testimony, specifically in Volume 3, pp.76-77.

Another matter re voi dire is that in p.95, this was when one\n of the jurors started sobbing, which further poisoned the well. Even though it\n is not on the record, I would still want to have it mentioned.\n >\n > (d) During\n closing argument, in Volume 4, I again bring up the matter of hostility based on\n observable body language.

It is due April 3rd.\n Although you did do a fairly good job representing yourself, there are a few issues that I need to address with\n you and explain why all the issues you would like to raise will not and cannot be raised.\n 1. The issue of the prosecutor bringing up the facts of your previous case: You did not object when it was\n brought up. I also do not see in the record that any judge ruled on your motion in limine, however a motion in\n limine is virtually meaningless unless you properly object and raise the issue during the trial. You did not do\n this. If you don't object at the proper time, you waive the issue for appeal.\n 2. Prosecutor brought up details of prior case: Although it was a good motion for a mistrial, you failed to object\n to a document that the State introduced into evidence with details of the previous conviction i.e. the document\n said the girls age, etc. Because that evidence was before the jury AND because you did not object, the issue\n was waived.\n 3. No direct Evidence -this issue is called a \"sufficiency of the evidence complain\" and I am raising this issue\n on your behalf.\n 4. Attacking the Texas approach to grand juries: you failed to raise this issue pre-trial and now you cannot\n raise it on appeal.\n 5. Officer Hermosillo's testimony should be thrown out: This should have been addressed pre-trial and at the\n time that he tstified. You waived this issue on appeal by not properly raising it at the trial level.\n 6. Excessive punishment: Considering you received probation, an 8th amendment excessive punishment\n argument is not valid on appeal. Much of the research on this issue that I have done shows that many men\n who went to trial and were convicted of the same offense received prison sentences.\n\n Your other issues labeled A-C in your letter are also not valid to raise on appeal because they were not\n properly preserved in the trial court.\n\n I have raised 3 issues all relating to the issue of whether the evidence was sufficient to prove you committed\n the alleged crime. In order to violate the change of address requirements, the state had to prove you 1. were\n required to register (which they did) and 2. that you failed to report 7 days before your intended move or 7 days\n after moving. The law also provides that someone who is homeless must only report once every 30 days and it\n also provides for people who do not actually move to an intended residence on an anticipated day are required\n to report only weekly. Neither of these provisions require in person. Thus the state did not prove that you\n intended to move on any particular date and therefore you did not fail to report 7 days prior. I also do not think\n they proved you actually changed addresses. Finally, I think you were in compliance with the reporting\n requirements for homeless people.\n\n However, where I think we still may lose is the fact that after leaving the residence were you required to report\n in person to state that you were homeless? And then you only had to report monthly after that? I think the law\n is not exactly clear and will be left to the court's interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://rnail.aol.com/webrnail-std/en-us/PrintMessage                                                     3/20/2015\n\fFwd: Appeal Draft                                                                                       Page 2 of2\n\n\n Again, the draft is rough and needs fine tuning, but I wanted to give you time to look over the issues raised\n before it gets filed on April 3.\n\n Thanks,\n\n Dayna\n\n\n Dayna L.

The Live Oak Police Department considers all complaints of officer misconduct a serious\n              matter and they are thoroughly investigated. The findings of the investigation are stated below.\n\n                        The officer observed a vehicle being operated with a defective headlamp which is probable cause\n              for the traffic stop. Upon contacting and identifying you as the driver and running your driver's license it\n              was discovered that you are a registered sex offender. After you were unable to provide a current\n              address the officer continued the investigation in an attempt to make certain that you were meeting your\n              obligation to provide a change of address as directed by law. The officer also wished to check the welfare\n              of the children in your vehicle. Your daughter was asked who you were. When the officer was told you\n              were her father no further questions were asked of her.\n\n                     During the traffic stop and investigation you were detained a total of 18 minutes and 45 seconds. I\n            believe this to be a reasonable time for the stop and investigation. You were then issued a warning\n            requiring no payment of fine or court action for Defective Headlamp and released.\n\n                   Your subsequent arrest that evening was obviously due to you not making proper notification of\n            address change to the agency you are required to report to. The arrest had nothing to do with the fact that\n            you were stopped by a Live Oak Police Officer.\n\n                     After a review and investigation into this incident, I find no wrong doing on the part of the officer.\n            This investigation has been completed and closed. No further action will be taken by the department on\n            this matter.\n\n\n\n                        Respectfully,\n\n\n                          ;~#~\n                        Lieutenant Matt Malone\n\n                        Patrol Division Commander\n\f",

In it,\n\nhe hopes to be able to prove that one of the key witnesses committed perjury.\n\n       This court has jurisdiction to entertain this Writ under Article 11.072 of the Texas\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure. According to the Code of Criminal Procedure 11.14 (1 ),\n\nPetitioner has his liberty restrained, and in 11.21 is the subject of coercive measures, and\n\n11.22 is under control and restraint. This is true even if he is not on probation, parole,\n\nand/or discharges his sentence. Additionally, retaining this conviction would categorize\n\nhim as a habitual criminal and would furthermore subject him to the rule of \"3 strikes,\n\nyou're out.\"\n\n\n\nBRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE UP TO AND INCLUDING THE TRIAL\n\n\n\n       Petitioner was renting a house from Tina Hernandez, who was living in Amarillo.\n\nIn November 2009, Petitioner and wife separate due to the stress of being harassed by\n\nneighbors and unable to find steady employment both because of his status as a registered\n\nsex offender. In the same month, Hernandez orders the Petitioner to leave by the end of\n\nthe month because she is moving back in. Petitioner finds no place that will admit him\n\nbecause of his labeled status as a \"sex offender\" (which is a misnomer because it implies\n\n\n                                             5\n\fthat the Petitioner in presently acting out as such). After she moves into the house in late\n\nNovember with Simon living now in one of the rooms, the hostility becomes so intolerant\n\nbecause of money owed her that Petitioner either sleeps in his car in the driveway in\n\norder to comply with the law 4RR47, 50, since there is no requirement that a person must\n\nsleep in a particular area of the property 3RR60, or sleeps in a nearby business parking\n\nlot as he tries to find a residence. On December 3, he contacts Officer Allen that he is\n\ngoing to move 3RR65-66, but has not yet found a place to do so. Tina Hernandez, on her\n\nown initiative, contacts Mr. Allen claiming that Simon moved away weeks before.\n\n       Petitioner at the time is separated from his wife [see item #1]; she asks him to\n\nbabysit the children for a couple of days while she is away on work [see item #2] for a\n\nthree days 4RR9-12. He does so. On the first morning, on his way to dropping off his\n\nchildren at school, he is stopped on a routine traffic stop and extensively and belligerently\n\ninterrogated by the officer who is convinced, upon running a background check, that he is\n\nin the process of kidnapping children; the children are scared by his demeanor and when\n\nthey finally calm down to verify their identity, he is free to go; Simon is arrested that\n\nnight, at the children's home. 4RR68-69\n\n       In 1985, Armando Simon was convicted of Sexual Assault; this was his only\n\nfelony conviction until the present case. Petitioner was indicted on February 25, 2010\n\nwith failure to Register a Change of Address in cause number 2010-CR-2132. Petitioner\n\nrejected nearly a dozen offers of probation from the prosecution in exchange for a guilty\n\nplea and instead elected to represent himself at his trial. Although the case was tried in\n\nthe 290th District Court, Judge Melisa Skinner's Court, the case was presided over by\n\nvisiting Judge Pat Priest. On October 19, 2011 the jury convicted Petitioner. On the same\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fday, Judge Priest assessed punishment at 2 years in the Texas Department of Criminal\n\nJustice, but the sentence was probated for a period of 10 years. 4RR96-97.\n\n\n\nBRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE SUBSEQUENT TO TRIAL\n\n\n\n       An appeal was prepared and submitted on April 3, 2012, by a Court appointed\n\nattorney; it is important to note that said attorney refused to include various issues that\n\nPetitioner strongly felt were crucial to the case and which are included herein,\n\nconcentrating instead on the insufficiency of evidence, because she claimed the Court\n\nwould not be able to concentrate on too many grounds, or, because they were\n\ninapplicable for an appeal; nonetheless, they could have been, and are, of relevance in a\n\nwrit ofhabeas corpus. No. 04-11-00783-CR [see Secondary Appendix]\n\n       The 4th court of Appeals denied the appeal, Simon v. State WL 2012, 4900916.\n\nDuring the appeal process, Defendant did not report to the probation bureaucracy. Upon\n\nreceiving notice that the 4th Court had denied the appeal, Defendant decided to continue\n\nto the next step with a Petition for discretionary Review (PDR), carried out pro se, filed\n\non November 6, 2012 with the Court of Criminal Appeals. On February 12, 2013, the\n\nPDR was denied in cause 1599-12, notification arriving in a white card. Upon receiving\n\nthe said white card, Petitioner immediately reported to the probation bureaucracy, which\n\ntypically had no record of the matter but which put him right away in probation status,\n\nwith minor restrictions.\n\n       On, or about March 1, 2013 Petitioner received a visit from his probation officer\n\nand disagreements ensued, which resulted in having additional, harsh, conditions added\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fon by the Court after a report was filed, said report Petitioner was not privy to. One of\n\nthem was to attend sex offender counseling sessions conducted by a policeman. Petitioner\n\ndid not do so, was arrested on or about April4 and his probation revoked on or about the\n\n24th of April.\n\n        Meantime, Petitioner had filed an Article 11.072 Writ of Habeas Corpus with the\n\ntrial court on March 12, 2013, citing the conditions of community supervision as well as\n\nerrors in the trial itself. On May 31, 2013 the Court denied the writ on the basis that\n\nPetitioner had filed it prior to the mandate (04-11-00783-CR) from the Court of Appeals\n\nissuing its mandate on March 19, which the Court itself admitted was a legal technicality.\n\n        Thereupon, Petitioner filed a 2254 Writ of Habeas Corpus with the U.S. District\n\nCourt on June 28, 2013. A year later, the Court denied the writ, agreeing with the State\n\ncounsel that exhaustion of State remedies had not occurred; in doing so, the Court\n\nignored Petitioner's rejoinder that doing so would have been a fruitless endeavor since\n\nthe higher State Courts would have agreed that the writ had been filed a few days too\n\nearly, prior to the mandate (04-11-00783-CR) being issued, and time was ticking. The\n\nCourt also ignored Petitioner's pointing out that, comity notwithstanding, according to\n\nDoctor v. Walters C.A. (Pa) 1996, F.3d 675 and Murray v. Carrier </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111727\"><a href=\"/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, an exception can be made in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice, or,\n\nwhen going back to the State level would be fruitless, thereby avoiding a bureaucratic\n\nmentality. Petitioner had also pointed out that going back to square one would be\n\ntantamount to putting him in the role of Sisyphus. Nonetheless, the Court denied the writ\n\nand, in disgust, Petitioner allowed the deadline to elapse before appealing to the U.S. 5th\n\nCircuit Court.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       However, to make this case even more convoluted, on January 28, 2014,\n\nPetitioner, who was in county jail at the time, was placed on parole even though his\n\nappeal on the revocation of his probation was still pending Simon v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">129635</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; this parole status ceased in May while Petitioner awaited the 4th Court of\n\nAppeals decision on the revocation. On July 30, 2014 the Court of Appeals vacated the\n\nrevocation of probation on the basis that the judge had abused its discretion. Petitioner\n\nhad filed a writ of habeas corpus on September 24, 2014. The next day, Petitioner was\n\nplaced on community supervision with restrictions against his religion being placed [item\n\n# 16]. The writ was denied on October 9 because it was filed prior to the mandate being\n\nissued and received by the Court. Petitioner once more filed the writ of habeas corpus on\n\nDecember 4, 2014 to begin the process all over again. On March 4, 2015, to absolutely no\n\none's surprise the writ was denied.\n\n       Whereupon Petitioner files this writ of habeas corpus with the 4th Court of\n\nAppeals to begin the process. All over again. All evidence cited in the present writ is on\n\nrecord with the trial court in the previous writ. Petitioner cannot produce copies of the\n\nevidence, and, of multiple copies of this writ due to dire financial reasons. Additionally,\n\ntwo items have recently come into his possession (after being lost) which will be relevant\n\nto this matter and are appended in Secondary Appendix, attached herein.\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f              ISSUES PRESENTED IN THIS WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n\n\n\n#1 The Wrong Case was Prosecuted\n\n#2 Voi Dire\n\n#3 Grand Jury\n\n#4 Mistrial\n\n#5 Questionnaire\n\n#6 Perjured testimony by Tina Hernandez\n\n#7 Destruction of exculpatory evidence & perjury by Curtis Hermosillo\n\n#8 Overbreadth\n\n#9 The law is un-Constitutional\n\n#10 Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n# 11 Bill of Attainder\n\n#12 Conditions of probation & parole are unconstitutional\n\n# 13 Cruel and unusual punishment\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f                                    ARGUMENTS\n\n\n\n#1 WRONG CASE WAS PROSECUTED\n\n\n\n       The trial took place for case 2009-CR-7309. 2RR4 This case is case 2010-CR-\n\n2132. As bizarre as it may seem, Petitioner was incarcerated for a crime that he did not\n\ncommit, and has served time for a trial that never took place.\n\n       The scheduled trial was for case 2009-CR-7309. However, the witnesses,\n\nevidence, circumstances, and testimony were all irrelevant to that case, but, they were\n\nrelevant to case 2010-CR-2132. Then, about two days after the end of the trial the State\n\ncompounded its blunder by dropping case 2009-CR-7309 for lack of evidence [see item\n\n#3]. To cap it all off, all further legal proceedings have taken place for case #20110-CR-\n\n2132 (including this writ) as if it had originally gone to trial. The 14th Amendment to\n\nthe United States Constitution states, in part: \"No State shall make or enforce any law\n\nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall\n\nany State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" As\n\nwell as the 5th Amendment: \"nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be\n\ntwice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a\n\nwitness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process\n\nof law.\"\n\n       Is this a legal technicality? Of course it is. But so was ruling against Petitioner's\n\noriginal writ of habeas corpus by the trial Court, and the Federal District Court, legal\n\ntechnicalities. For that matter---assuming for the sake of argument---that Petitioner did\n\n\n                                             11\n\findeed move and not report a change of address for a couple of weeks, that too would\n\nhave been a legal technicality. So this is not a matter of De minimis non curat lex (the law\n\ndoes not concern itself with trifles).\n\n\n\n#2 VOIDIRE\n\n\n\n        Granted that both sides in a trial have peremptory challenges to picking jurors.\n\nHowever, if one goes along with the basic premise that a defendant is innocent until\n\nproven guilty, a concept which is endemic in every international legal edifice, then the\n\nprosecutor should not have the power to strike out potential jurors simply because that\n\njuror is well educated, or has voiced that he/she thinks the Defendant is innocent, etc. A\n\nprosecutor should be severely restricted as to the reasons for striking a juror (such as any\n\nrelationship to the Defendant), and, should be forbidden from asking questions which are\n\nof a \"fishing expedition\" in nature in order to ascertain a juror's state of mind. This\n\nviolates due process. Examples of this can be found in the present case. 2RR22-81\n\n        The jurors which demonstrated a consideration that the Defendant was innocent,\n\nor, any kind of education above high school, or for that matter, any degree of rationality,\n\nwere struck off by the prosecutor.\n\n\n\n#3 GRAND JURY\n\n        The Founding Fathers realized that being accused of a crime and having to go\n\nthrough a trial was a traumatic event. Hence, they came up with the concept of the Grand\n\nJury in order to determine first if the evidence warranted a trial. This is not just some\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\farmchair speculation. Individuals have committed suicide when formally accused of a\n\ncrime even though they were innocent.\n\n       It is also a fact that individuals have been held in custody for over a year, pending\n\ntrial, whereupon they are finally released---after losing their jobs and/or families---for\n\nlack of evidence. In these instances, the prosecutor was playing a game of \"chicken,\"\n\nhoping that the innocent person would plead to a minor sentence, such as probation even\n\nthough there was no evidence against that defendant, i.e., he was innocent. Petitioner met\n\nseveral while incarcerated who were in jail for nearly a year but since they would not\n\n\"crack,\" and there was no evidence against them, they were finally released.\n\n        The concept of the Grand Jury has been perverted by prosecutors. Almost always,\n\nit has been relegated to being a rubber stamp. In the rare instances wherein a Grand Jury\n\nhas gone against the wishes of the prosecutor, the latter has simply convened another\n\nGrand Jury which would give a true bill.\n\n       The Grand Jury that oversaw the presentation of the evidence against the\n\nDefendant should have had an independent advocate to argue, if ever so briefly, why a\n\ntrial should not take place.\n\n        The above problem with Grand Juries violates the    5th   Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution.\n\n\n\n#4MISTRIAL\n\n        A motion for a mistrial was denied by the Court when the Defendant objected to\n\nboth the Prosecutor and Hermosillo mentioning details of the original offence that had\n\noccurred 27 years prior, contrary to the Court's order on August 12, 2011. This order was\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fa result of a Motion for Limine asking the Court to eliminate all mention of that offense\n\nby either the Prosecutor or any of his witnesses. The motion was denied, the Court\n\nremarking that to do so, the law would be effectively nullified; the Court did order to\n\nrestrict the Prosecution from mentioning details, such as the age of the complainant ( 16\n\ny/o) in order to ensure a fair trial. The Court denied the Motion for Mistrial on the\n\ngrounds that the same information was deliberately introduced by stealth by the\n\nprosecutor earlier in a document, and the Defense had not objected then, since the age\n\nhad not been voiced. 3RR79-80 However, said record was never viewed by the jury.\n\n\n\n#5 QUESTIONNAIRE\n\n\n\n       A motion introduced to the Court by the Defendant, prior to the trial beginning, to\n\nadminister a questionnaire to the voi dire candidates was denied. The Court stated that a\n\nquestionnaire was appropriate only for capital cases, and, that some of the questions'\n\nanswers were readily available from the card that the voi dire candidates were to fill out.\n\n2RR11-12\n\n       However, what the Court failed to appreciate is that verbally answering some of\n\nthe questions would evoke a negative emotional reaction, since this trial indirectly\n\ninvolved a sexual offence. Sex offences are universally acknowledged to evoke a\n\nnegative, visceral response. This negative emotion would then become emotional\n\ncontagion and would contaminate the jury pool prior to the trial even starting. This could\n\nbe, and was, exploited by the prosecution for prosecuting the case from the very\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fbeginning, which is what happened. 2RR22-81 In one such instance, a female juror who\n\nhad herself been the victim of sexual assault began to cry loudly. 2RR95\n\n       In addition, experimental evidence exists that actual viewpoints may be admitted\n\nin the privacy of a paper and pencil questionnaire what would not be voiced in public.\n\n\n\n#6 PERJURED TESTIMONY BY TINA HERNANDEZ\n\n\n\n       The Defendant's star witness was a sociopath named Tina Miranda, aka Tina\n\nHernandez, aka Tyna Holmes, aka Tina Ornelas, Tina Wilkins. A habitual, incorrigible\n\ncriminal, she has had convictions for shoplifting, theft of state property, bounced checks\n\n4RR36 and murder 3RR120-123. She described the butchering of her husband as simply\n\n\"domestic violence.\" At the time of her testimony, she had been charged with theft of\n\nelderly ($120,000), for which she subsequently pled guilty and received probation by\n\nJudge Angus (who is presently under investigation for taking bribes). During her cross-\n\nexamination, she denied having shoplifted, in spite of her official criminal record, thereby\n\ncommitting perjury. 3RR121-122 She denied being vindictive towards the Defendant, yet\n\nsimultaneously admitted that the Defendant owed her money and had greatly\n\ninconvenienced her. 3RR125-126\n\n\n\n#7 DESTRUCTION OF EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE & PERJURY BY CURTIS\n\n       HERMOSILLO\n\n       During Defendant's opening statement, Defendant pointed out that officer Curtis\n\nHermosillo, the patrol officer who stopped the Defendant when he was taking his\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fchildren to their school, was scheduled to testify and that Defendant was eagerly awaiting\n\nthe opportunity because days after bonding out he had contacted the chief of the Live\n\nOak Police Department 15RR16-17. In that letter, Defendant asked the chief to preserve\n\nthe tape of the incident with Hermosillo for the future trial, since it clearly showed that\n\nthe officer's subsequent report of Defendant admitting to living in Live Oak was a lie, in\n\nso far as it has Defendant repeatedly informed the officer that he was homeless 6RR66. It\n\nalso showed the officer to have been extremely belligerent and obsessed with the idea\n\nthat the children that he was taking to school (his biological children) were actually\n\nabductees who did not know him.\n\n       Hermosillo was called to the witness stand by the Prosecution. To the Defendant's\n\nastonishment, it was the Prosecution who first raised the issue of the tape. Hermosillo\n\nsaid that the tape had mysteriously malfunctioned, and had malfunctioned in only that\n\nperiod of time involving the incident, not before, not after. 3RR76-77 Throughout, the\n\nwitness' body language was unusual during testimony, sporting a Cheshire-cat grin from\n\near to ear that never left his face. 4RR67-68\n\n       Defendant subsequently called to the stand the abovementioned police chief, who\n\nconfirmed having -received the letter [see item # 4] requesting the preservation of the\n\ntape.3RR165-170 Obviously, the Defendant would not have made this request if the tape\n\ncorroborated Hermosillo's testimony; it would have been damning. Additionally, a letter\n\nof complaint sent to the Live Oak Police Department by the complainant was responded\n\nto, wherein Lt. Malone cites the precise time (in seconds) that the incident took place,\n\nwhich would strongly indicate that he was timing the video for that much accuracy [see\n\nSecond Appendix].\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\f       The destruction of exculpatory evidence is a long-standing, cherished, tradition\n\namong both prosecutors and law enforcement personnel and we have in this case a prime\n\nexample. It is a patently obvious conclusion that the tape was erased in order to achieve a\n\nconviction of the Defendant. Only someone who is determined to confirm the\n\nDefendant's conviction could possibly conclude otherwise, and, it speaks volumes of\n\nhow contaminated had the jury's mind become that something so obvious was ignored.\n\n\n\n#8 THE OVERBREADTH DOCTRINE\n\n\n\n       The law, as it now stands, is one size fits all. \"Sex offender\" is not only a\n\nmisnomer in that it implies that the recipient of this label is actively engaging in sexual\n\nperversions, but it is an absurd catchall term. No practical differentiations are made for\n\nthe different types of behaviors that fall under this catchall category, although both\n\ncommon sense, and professional judgments, acknowledges that there is a tremendous gulf\n\nbetween the different categories of \"sex offenders.\" However, the law makes no such\n\ndistinction and treats a 19 y/o who has a consensual sex with his 16 y/o girlfriend (and\n\nsubsequently marry) the same as a serial rapist, the same as an exhibitionist, the same as a\n\ncollege student who got drunk at a party and briefly grabbed a female's breast, the same\n\nas a serial pedophile, the same as someone who has had one offence in 30 years, the same\n\nas one who has had a dozen rapes in the past year the same as a child killer. They are all\n\nsubjected to the same restrictions in parole and probation and in registration. Just as a\n\nperson may not receive the death penalty for stealing a chocolate bar from a store as he\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fwould if he was a serial killer, the same law should not apply to all so-called \"sex\n\noffenders.\"\n\n        In the past decade, the United States Supreme Court has heard several cases\n\nchallenging sex offender registries.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2496</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; US. v. Comstock 560 U.S. 126,130 S. Ct. 1949. Throughout these cases, the\n\nfollowing terms have been used interchangeably, without distinction or even accuracy:\n\nsex offenders, sexual predators, child abusers, dangerous sex offenders, child sex\n\noffenders, child kidnappers, sexually dangerous persons, pedophiles, child molesters,\n\nviolent sex offenders, sexual abusers of children, persons who, due to a mental illness are\n\nsexually dangerous. The same indiscriminate use can be found in the fifty states, both in\n\nand outside of courtrooms, whereupon Petitioner asks: is an exhibitionist really a\n\n\"sexually dangerous person\"? Is a teenager having consensual sex with his girlfriend\n\nwhile on their 8th date \"a child molester\"? In fact, even two persons convicted of Sexual\n\nAssault may have different offenses yet both be labeled identically as being violent: one\n\nis a brutal rapist the other having consensual sex with a sexually active teenager, yet both\n\nare seen as rapists.\n\n        To make differentiations in sex offenders and thereby     as~ess   requirements and\n\npunishments differently, can be very irritating to those persons on a fanatical vendetta, or\n\nwho are prone to rigidly view things as black or white, yes-or-no categories, or who are\n\nalarmists who see sex offenders in every corner.\n\n        Pedophilia and rape are heinous crimes. No one is arguing otherwise. But, to\n\ninsist that all of the above are equivalent is to have myopic vision, or to be a fanatic. In\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\ffact, sometimes even legally in the original offence an important distinction is made: in\n\ncertain instances, exposing oneself is a misdemeanor, not a felony, e.g., Tristan v. State\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; nonetheless, such offences are lumped together with serial pedophiles.\n\n       Furthermore, the restrictions imposed on \"sex offenders\" by the parole and\n\nprobation bureaucracies, as occurred in the present instance, are unquestionably punitive.\n\nIn Carr v. US, Reynolds v. US., Smith v. Doe, and US v. Kebodeaux v. Comstock,\n\nsupra, there are the usual threadbare platitudes that the restrictions are for the protection\n\nof the public, though it is never explained how, exactly, are they so. For example, how\n\nexactly is not being allowed to express one's religion during holidays a deterrent to\n\ncrime? Petitioner does not know the answer and has never been enlightened.\n\nAdditionally, in the deliberation of Kebodeaux, supra, it is even mentioned that the\n\nconditions of parole and probation are for the purpose of rehabilitation and that they deter\n\ncrime, but how is not being able to be with one's one children a deterrent to crime, and\n\nhow is having to ask permission of a parole bureaucrat in order to establish a romantic\n\nrelationship rehabilitative? Not being a licensed attorney, Petitioner would love to learn.\n\n       Only someone who has not been listed in a sex offender registry could claim that\n\nthere are no punitive consequences. Yet, all of the above, wide-varying \"sex offenders\"\n\nhave to endure the same fate. In fact, the Alaskan Sex Offender Registry Act (SORA)\n\nSmith v. Doe, supra) includes child kidnappers as \"sex offenders\" even though this\n\ninclusion could apply to parents feuding over custody of their children.\n\n       Incidentally, the Athenian lawgiver, Draco, decreed that stealing a head of\n\ncabbage merited the death penalty (Plutarch, Lives), hence the term \"draconian.\" His\n\nfellow Athenians objected, stating that that was the same punishment for murder. Draco,\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\ftoo, had a rationale worthy of an American court of appeals: he stated that death was the\n\nappropriate punishment for stealing a head of cabbage, but unfortunately Nature had not\n\nallowed for a worse punishment for murderers. That kind of mentality, it seems, is alive\n\nand well when it comes to the present matter.\n\n\n\n#9 THE LAW IS UN-CONSTITUTIONAL\n\n\n\n       It is universally acknowledged that an accusation, to say nothing of a conviction,\n\nof a sexual offence is highly inflammatory, one which elicits a very strong emotional\n\nreaction. Consequently, is there anyone who is so obtuse as to believe or claim that a\n\nDefendant can obtain a fair trial when the first words that fall out of a prosecutor's mouth\n\nare, \"The Defendant is a convicted sex offender\"? A jury is thereby strongly prejudiced\n\nagainst the Defendant before the trial even starts. A fair trial is impossible and is thus a\n\nviolation of a fundamental right. Saldana v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1591817\"><a href=\"/opinion/1591817/saldano-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       The indictment was Failure to Report a Change of Address. 2RR109-110 The\n\njudge informed the potential jurors during voi dire that the Defendant had a prior\n\nconviction for Sexual Assault 2RR16-17.\n\n       It is a cornerstone of the law that any previous offence should not be presented to\n\na jury during a trial so that the jurors' evaluation of the evidence not be tainted. There\n\nmust be no bias in the jury in order to have a fair trial as guaranteed under the Sixth\n\nAmendment---as well as the due process section of both the Fifth and 14th\n\nAmendments. This is particularly the case when the previous offense is one that is\n\nemotionally explosive, as in a sex case. This case conclusively proves, as possibly no\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fother case could, that the Defendant could absolutely not obtain a fair trial under this law\n\nsince he was previously convicted, even though there was a complete lack of hard,\n\nobjective, evidence---none, absolutely none---as to his having established another\n\nresidence.\n\n       The Defendant noted in the trial that the change in attitude towards him before\n\nand after the information about the Sexual Assault charge was instantly noticeable, and\n\nhostile. This was evident in the voi dire phase 2RR85-86. It was evident in the closing\n\nargument 4RR74, when one juror, for example kept his face averted ninety degrees away\n\nwhile Defendant spoke. One juror who had been herself a victim of sexual assault began\n\nto cry loudly during the voi dire phase. 2RR95\n\n\n\n#10 INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE\n\n\n\n       The evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for failing to register a\n\nchange of address as required by the sex offender registration program because the State\n\nfailed to prove that Appellant intended to change addresses. Green v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541095\"><a href=\"/opinion/2541095/green-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Crim.App-Houst. [14th Dist], 2011, pet refd); Tex. Code Crim. Pro.\n\n62.055(a). The evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for failing to register a\n\nchange of address as required by the sex offender registration program because the State\n\nfailed to prove that Appellant had actually changed addresses. Tex. Code Crim. Pro.\n\n62.055(a). The evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for failing to register a\n\nchange of address as required by the sex offender registration program because the\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fevidence actually supports that Appellant was m compliance with the registration\n\nrequirements. Tex. Code Crim. Pro. 62.055(i).\n\n       It is ironic that some of the Prosecution's own witnesses corroborated the fact\n\nthat the Defendant had no residence. The Prosecution tried through verbal legerdemain to\n\nimply that the issue was whether the Defendant was intending to move, but the\n\nindictment reads quite clearly that the Defendant had moved to a new residence and had\n\nnot reported the change of address [see item# 5] and Article 62.055 of the Texas Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure is quite clear on this. To this day, Defendant would like to know\n\nwhere, exactly, did he move to. No objective, hard, evidence was produced to prove the\n\nState's case: there was no lease, no photographs, no DNA, no checks, no bills, no change\n\nof address forms, no landlord, no address. Nothing. The Defendant never truly violated\n\nthe law, but he was convicted simply because he was labeled a \"sex offender.\" At no\n\npoint did the prosecutor provide an address where the Defendant was supposedly living\n\nin. Furthermore, a car is not a residence; electric power cannot be installed, nor a\n\nrefrigerator, bed, or television, or sofa; nor can he receive mail, unless the mailman\n\nchances upon him and tries to chase him down while driving. And the address given by\n\nMr. Hermosillo turned out to be nonexistent, one that was concocted by him on the spur\n\nofthe moment 3RR73, 83.\n\n       Insufficiency of evidence was used as the principal argument for appeal by the\n\ncourt-appointed appeal attorney, even though the Petitioner was forcefully insisting on\n\nciting the same arguments as in this writ. Not surprisingly, the 4th Court of Appeals cited-\n\n--as usual---the Calvinistic Jackson v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Virginia case is\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fconstantly being utilized by the various courts of appeal of various states in order to\n\navoid their responsibility. In the denial, the   4th   Court of Appeals stated that, \"Under that\n\nstandard, we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict whether\n\nany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"\n\n       Yes, by all means, let us review all of the evidence.\n\n       In the Court of first instance, the State's case rested principally on the testimony\n\nof two individuals. Curtis Hermosillo claimed that in mid-December Petitioner lived at a\n\nparticular address---which turned out does not exist. Tina Omelas---a habitual criminal\n\nguilty of everything from fraud and theft to shoplifting and murder---claimed that\n\nPetitioner had moved out in mid-November. Now, if one were to look at the\n\nprosecution's evidence, and only at the prosecution's evidence---without even so much as\n\nlooking at the cross-examination---then one would, of course, agree that the weight of the\n\nevidence is on the side of the State.\n\n       But, if we also include the cross-examination, the defense witnesses and the\n\ndefense's evidence, i.e., if we truly include ALL of the evidence, then it becomes a totally\n\ndifferent matter.\n\n        In regards to Hermosillo, the facts that Petitioner asked the Live Oak police chief\n\nto preserve the tape wherein Petitioner explained to Hermosillo he was homeless, that this\n\nwas confirmed by the police chief, Hermosillo's mocking demeanor in Court, that the\n\nDefendant in his opening statement stated he was looking forward to presenting the tape\n\nwhich was objective proof of his innocence, that it was the prosecutor who first brought\n\nup the tape, and, that the said tape mysteriously \"malfunctioned\" only for those crucial 15\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fminutes according to his testimony, then Hermosillo's testimony appears to be rotten,\n\nrotten to the core, as befits a \"bad cop.\"\n\n       And then there is the testimony of Tina Ornelas (or Hernandez) who was, and\n\nremains, a verified sociopath, who committed peljury on the stand, and who admitted that\n\nPetitioner owed her money and had greatly inconvenienced her. Now, a convicted felon's\n\nword is always suspect in any State. Carson v. Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1676641\"><a href=\"/opinion/1676641/carson-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, rehearing\n\noverruled, review denied, certiorari denied </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, if it helps to convict a Defendant, it seems then that the testimony of a\n\nfelon is reliable. But, if it helps to exonerate a Defendant, then a felon's testimony is\n\ndeemed worthless. Incidentally, this unfair prejudice is similar to a mother's or a wife's\n\ntestimony.\n\n        Additionally, in using Jackson v. Virginia as a crutch, the 4th Court of Appeals\n\narbitrarily discounted the testimony of Petitioner's ex-wife for incomprehensible reasons.\n\nSimon v. State, supra: \"Although Simon told Officer Allen that he had separated from\n\nTelly and was living in his car at a parking lot, which also was supported by Telly's\n\ntestimony, the jury could have disbelieved that evidence and, instead, believed that\n\nSimon was residing at the residence on Rimwood.\" In other words, the habitual criminal\n\nmust be believed, but the honest citizen should be disbelieved. Anything to affirm the\n\nconviction of a \"sex offender.\"\n\n        Furthermore, there is the matter of non-evidence as evidence: the prosecutor did\n\nnot provide any hard, objective, evidence that showed Petitioner living in another\n\nresidence: a lease signed by him, a change of address form, utility bills, DNA,\n\nphotographs, a moving van contract, a landlord. Nothing.\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f       Lastly, generally speaking, there is an elephant in the [court]room that everyone\n\nevades, is rarely whispered about much less mentioned out loud. Like the proverbial\n\nelephant in the room, everyone knows of it, tiptoes around it, but is afraid to openly\n\nacknowledge its existence: to put it crudely, it is that jurors can be stupid. This statement\n\nmay appear as distasteful, as offensive, as vulgar, and so it may be, but it is also\n\nunquestionably true and everyone knows it. Every judge, every lawyer, on many\n\noccasions, has been faced with a verdict that defied all reason, all comprehension, all\n\nevidence, which is why so many attorneys are averse to a jury trial, civil or criminal.\n\nInstead, Courts pretend that the people dragged off the street to serve in the jury are, one\n\nand all, rational, intelligent, and even well versed in the law, whereas experience\n\noccasionally proves otherwise. The irony, of course, is that when one of these same\n\npotential jurors is chanced on the street, that same judge or attorney may denigrate that\n\nperson's IQ or rationality. Yet, Jackson v. Virginia, supra, ensures finality with the\n\nassumption that a person, simply by being placed in a jury box will be automatically\n\nimproved in logic and rationality and will experience a sharp rise in IQ. Quite simply,\n\ncourts of appeal rely on Jackson v. Virginia as an excuse to avoid making difficult\n\ndecisions. The instant case before the Court, however, does not require making a difficult\n\ndecision at all as to sufficiency of evidence.\n\n       The present case illustrates the above m that Petitioner was convicted on a\n\nscintilla of evidence. There was more than a reasonable doubt present in the case. Indeed,\n\nthe dearth of evidence against him underscores the fact that the jury was prejudiced by\n\nannouncement of defendant's previous conviction and present legal standing (i.e., being\n\nlabeled as a \"sex offender\").\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f#11 BILL OF ATTAINDER\n\n       The Constitution bans bills of attainder, whether they are directed against an\n\nindividual person or against a group of people (Hamilton, Alexander, The Federalist\n\nPapers (#84), Mentor Books, 1961). The sex offender registration act of Texas, and for\n\nthat matter of all the states, achieves that status and, as such, it is un-Constitutional.\n\nAlthough the law was originally intended as a safeguard for the public, the unintended\n\nconsequences have subsequently transformed it into a bill of attainder. Objections to the\n\nlaw cannot be waved aside simply by stating that the original intent of the law was non-\n\npunitive. The drug thalidomide was never intended to have deleterious effects, but the\n\nundeniable fact is that taking the drug led to birth defects. No one has ever claimed that\n\nthe birth defects did not take place, or did not exist, yet persons who defend the sex\n\noffender registrations absurdly claim that the deleterious effects do not exist simply\n\nbecause the original intent of the law was not punitive.\n\n       The posting the identity and address of individuals who have been labeled \"sex\n\noffenders\" have resulted in well-documented acts of vandalism against such individuals;\n\nIt has also led to de facto segregation into mini-ghettos (Levenson, Jill & Cotter, Leo.\n\n(2005) The impact of sex offender residence restrictions: 1,000 feet from danger or one\n\nstep from absurd?

As such, it is a type of incarceration albeit very mild by\n\ncomparison, but incarceration nonetheless. It has also led to restrictions on employment.\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fPetitioner himself has been evicted several times from decent apartments when it became\n\nknown through the official website that he was \"a registered sex offender,\" so that he has\n\nhad to live in a series of squalid places of residence although he has---not yet---been\n\nforced to live under a bridge, as has happened with some individuals. In a sense, it is a\n\ntype of incarceration.\n\n       In the trial, Officer Allen admitted of being aware such occurrences 3RR60-61\n\nand when Petitioner was homeless even the Salvation Army residence for homeless\n\npeople would not accept him in the middle of a very cold winter because he was a\n\nregistered \"sex offender\" 3RR60-61. It has also led to social ostracism. This occurs even\n\nthough his sole sexual offence was 30 years ago, and even though he \"paid his debt to\n\nsociety,\" he continues to be punished. Fleming v.

Secondly, if and when he\n\nis placed back on parole, he will have the same restrictions as before due to his being \"a\n\nconvicted sex offender.\" And since his sentence has already expired halfway, it is\n\nbeneficial to deal with the topic now instead of waiting for the imposition of the\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\frestrictions; since the courts move at a glacial pace his sentence would be finished by the\n\ntime that the Court of Appeals, or the Criminal Court of Appeals (or, conceivably, even\n\nthe trial Court) came to a decision on the matter.\n\n       Among the requirements were the following:\n\n       K. Defendant may not establish a romantic relationship without the approval of\n\nthe Probation Officer (PO).\n\n       U. Abide by all \"Holiday Notice\" rules. These were verbally explained to the\n\nDefendant to be a prohibition against displaying religious ornaments and signs which\n\ncould be visible from outside the home. Presumably, signs stating \"Jesus has Risen,\" or,\n\n\"Happy Easter\" during Easter, and \"Merry Christmas,\" or \"Peace on Earth\" during\n\nDecember would simply be too attractive to children, who would then gravitate in droves\n\nto the sex offender's home, thereby becoming potential victims.\n\n       I (a) Defendant may not own a computer which does not have internet access. The\n\nirony, of course, is that a computer not having internet access has no access to internet\n\npornographic sites. Likewise, Defendant may not use a public library's computer, even\n\nthough, again ironically, they are blocked from such similar sites.\n\n       Said restrictions violate Defendant's constitutional right of freedom of religious\n\nexpression and worship, freedom of assembly and, freedom of the press, all found in the\n\nFirst Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\n       Approximately a week afterwards Parole Officer Franco Olvera went to\n\nDefendant's apartment, did not find him there at the time, called him, and ultimately\n\nordered him to return from Walmart, where Defendant had been grocery shopping, and\n\nmeet him at his residence. Upon entering and doing a thorough inspection of the\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fpremises, Mr. Olvera concluded that defendant was not living there. This conclusion was\n\nbased on (a) there was dirt in places inside the apartment (b) there were few groceries and\n\neating utensils (c) there were cobwebs inside the bathtub. When pressed for an answer,\n\nDefendant admitted that he had been shopping for food and plastic utensils that had run\n\nout, that he usually ate at fast food places that had \"dollar menus.\" He also admitted to\n\nbabysitting his biological children when they returned from school and helping them with\n\ntheir homework (they are straight-A students) while their mother worked and attended\n\ncollege, as well as instilling in them respect for their mother and their teachers. In\n\nexchange, defendant could take a hot shower and have a snack in their home, since his\n\nown shower was defective and had not been repaired by the landlord despite repeated\n\nrequests.\n\n       At this point, it must be mentioned that Petitioner lived in a \"dump.\" Exceedingly\n\nfew landlords will rent to sex offenders to the point that some are even forced out to be\n\nhomeless and to live under bridges, or, just simply decide to disappear and go\n\nunderground, whereupon they lead a relatively normal life. Those landlords that do rent\n\nalmost always do so in disreputable neighborhoods, sometimes in decrepit dwellings. In a\n\nsense, \"sex offenders\" are relegated to mini-ghettos. Items # 14 & 15 are pictures of\n\nwhere the Petitoner was living and evicted from once it became known of his legal status\n\nthrough the registry. Items# 16 & 17 are pictures of where he has/is being forced to live.\n\n       Approximately on March 6, 2013, Petitioner was summoned to the PO's office. A\n\nreport had been forwarded to the Court in the interim of which Defendant was not\n\ninformed and, therefore, could not give his version of the visit. In retaliation for not\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fhaving enough grocenes at home, having a dirty apartment and taking showers\n\nelsewhere, additional, harsh, penalties were imposed, to wit, [see item # 7]\n\n       ---prohibition against having any contact with his biological children,\n\n       ---attend a \"sex offender treatment program,\" even though for many years he\n\nattended said program while on parole,\n\n       ---periodically submit to polygraph examinations,\n\n       ---avoid places where children might congregate,\n\n       This could be considered to be a violation of the much neglected 9th\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, an amendment which, paradoxically, is\n\noften overlooked in legal matters precisely because it is not specific in enumerating\n\nConstitutional rights, which in this particular instance could be construed as the right to\n\nmaintain familial integrity (although there are other interpretations; cf. Randy Barnett,\n\n\"The Ninth Amendment: It Means What It Says,\" Texas Law Review, 85, 2006).\n\n       Petitioner has tried very hard to be a productive, beneficial, influence in his\n\nchildren's lives, particularly in their schoolwork, and they are one of the few joys that are\n\nleft to him. Furthermore, said restriction penalized the children, who found the sudden\n\nseparation to be traumatic; not only was such a separation detrimental to their emotional\n\nstate of mind, but it was also detrimental from a scholastic standpoint (the punitive aspect\n\nof sex offender registration on \"sex offenders\"' families is a known fact: Levenson, Jill &\n\nTewksbury, Richard. (2007) Collateral damage: family members of registered sex\n\noffenders. American Journal of Criminal Justice, 34, 54-68; item# 11). Incidentally, an\n\nautomatic investigation of the children by the Child Protective Services was instituted,\n\nthanks to Mr. Olvera. The caseworker, Nadene Long, found no evidence of neglect or\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\fabuse; instead, she found the children to be highly intelligent and healthy, highly\n\nmotivated towards school and respectful of parents and teachers, and aware of what\n\nmeasures to take in case of emergencies. She considered the referral to have been a waste\n\nof her time. It is difficult to reconcile the rationale for this separation of children from\n\ntheir father as a result of the father not having enough groceries in his apartment at the\n\ntime, or having cobwebs in his bathtub. Not to mention irrelevant to the original charge\n\nof failure to register.\n\n        As to the polygraph, two points need be made. One, it is an obvious violation of\n\nthe 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution, against self-incrimination. Two,\n\non the other hand, the results of a polygraph examination can be, and have been, used\n\npunitively by the State in order to incarcerate a person (Marcum v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1678092\"><a href=\"/opinion/1678092/marcum-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\n\nLeonard v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">). Four, proof that the polygraph's intent is simply\n\npunitive and judicial is the fact that no therapist is hired by the State who does not agree\n\nto include the mandatory polygraph as part of its \"therapy,\" even though there is a wide\n\nplethora of types of therapies. Lastly, polygraphs are notoriously unreliable.\n\n        In regards to the rule of avoiding places where children might congregate, the\n\nregulation is absurdly vague since children can be found in the sidewalks, in the malls, in\n\nthe parks, in the libraries, in downtown, in movies, in McDonald's, in Wendy's, in Pizza\n\nHut, in museums, in theaters, in Whataburger, in Taco Cabana, in pet stores, in clothing\n\nshops, in ice cream shops, in yogurt shops, in Starbucks, in planetariums, in Sea World,\n\nin Six Flags, in lakes, in football games, in baseball games, in hockey games, in\n\nbasketball games, in sport stores, etc. Ironically, the only place where children would not\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\fbe found would be in stripper clubs and shops that sell pornography, neither place being\n\nof interest or intent to patronize by Petitioner.\n\n        Lastly, Petitioner has a long history of carrying out scientific research and of\n\ninvolvement in literary endeavors [see item # 10]. To this end, he requires the use of\n\ncomputers, which are ubiquitous and almost mandatory for these purposes: e-mails and\n\nsubmissions to journal and book publishers, for example. Also, the computer is also used\n\nfor storing information, collating, and as a document creation. Restriction of use would\n\nviolate his 1st Amendment right. Furthermore, restriction on the use of computers\n\nhobbled Defendant in the preparation of the original writ, in so far as he was unable to\n\nobtain legal documents, ask legal opinions, thereby violating his rights under the 5th, 6th\n\nand 14th Amendments.\n\n        In January 2014, Petitioner was placed on parole. He received the same\n\nrestrictions as those above with the additional increase in: (1) inability to attend church\n\nservices due to mandatory \"lockdown\" during weekends, thereby violating his\n\nConstitutional right to religious worship (2) he was placed on ankle monitor and his\n\nmovements restricted and monitored (3) he was forbidden to enter libraries, bookstores\n\nand movie theaters, thereby violating the   1st   Amendment. Furthermore, he was forbidden\n\nto see movies in movie theaters at any time, again violating his     1st   Amendment rights.\n\nObjections were arrogantly ignored by the parole bureaucrats, as usual.\n\n        Even should Petitioner find himself not on parole or probation, this ground is still\n\napplicable in this writ since he can have those conditions imposed on him on any future\n\ninstance of probation and/or parole.\n\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\f#13 CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT\n\n\n\n       The standard for the     8th   Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual\n\npunishment is twofold: (1) either a punishment was considered cruel and unusual at the\n\ntime of the Bill of Rights compilation, or, (2) it is inconsistent with modem day\n\nstandards. Ford v. Wainwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111725\"><a href=\"/opinion/111725/ford-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111725\"><a href=\"/opinion/111725/ford-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 Le D 2d 335.\n\nPetitioner believes that both instances apply here.\n\n       At cursory glance, it may seem strange to claim that Petitioner received cruel and\n\nunusual punishment in this case. However, going to prison for two years for supposedly\n\nhaving changed addresses without notification for three weeks is, indeed, cruel and\n\nunusual punishment. There was no one victimized; there was no loss of money, no\n\nembezzlement, no counterfeiting; no arson; there was no loss of property or damage to\n\nproperty; there were no drugs involved, no use, transportation, selling, or manufacturing.\n\nFurthermore, at no point did the Petitioner try to drop under the radar and go\n\nunderground, which would have been easy; he tried to keep to the law by contacting\n\nOfficer Allen; instead of being given kudos for trying to keep to the letter of the law, at a\n\nstressful period in his life, he was instead arrested and charged with a felony.\n\n       Additionally, although it may furthermore appear to the uninitiated that being on\n\nprobation is a mild form of punishment, it can be seen from the above that the special\n\nharsh restrictions imposed on \"sex offenders\" are actually cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nPractically every one of the Constitutional rights in the Bill of Rights has been negated\n\nhere. Incarcerated prisoners have a greater degree of protection of their Constitutional\n\nrights than the Petitioner had during probation or parole! No matter how the State spins it,\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\feither in the form of a parole bureaucrat, or of counsel for the State, being deprived of so\n\nmany Constitutional rights is cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       The sex offender registry law is conducive to cruel and unusual punishment on\n\nthree levels. On one level, the range of punishment is excessive for what is, as has been\n\nstated so many times in this petition, for all intents and purpose, an administrative,\n\nvictimless crime. This is particularly so if the period of non-registration is a matter of\n\ndays or weeks and not years.\n\n       On a second level, the registry law serves as a peg for attaching other, additional\n\nlaws that are themselves most certainly punitive in that they restrict a person's liberty\n\nmore and more by increments. Using the registry as a basis, local and state government\n\nentities have passed laws stating that anyone found in those registries may not rent\n\ndomiciles, may not enter certain tax-supported public properties, live in certain\n\nneighborhoods, utilize certain public services, etc. (Petitioner, for example, was fined in\n\n2012 for picking up his son from a swimming pool after swimming lessons because of a\n\nLive Oak municipal law). At times it seems as if communities are in a competition as to\n\nwhich one will be the most innovative or pass the more restrictions. For all intents and\n\npurpose they are bills of attainder attached to a sex offender registry bill of attainder. As\n\nusual, these additional laws are passed with a preamble that they are for the purpose of\n\nensuring public safety, but the effect is indisputably punitive and, if honestly admitted,\n\nwere also intended that way. The thalidomide birth defects did take place.\n\n        Just as a member of an audience will cringe at watching a Chinese contortionist,\n\nso has Petitioner cringed at reading the elaborate verbal contortions to deny ex post facto\n\nstatus to sex offender registries, e.g., Smith v. Doe, supra; Reynolds v. U S. Writing a\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\fconcurring opinion, Justice Souter in the former nevertheless cites his misgivings: \"The\n\nfact that the Act uses past crime as the touchstone, probably sweeping in a significant\n\nnumber of people who pose no real threat to the community, serves to feed suspicion that\n\nsomething more than regulation of safety is going on; when a legislature uses prior\n\nconvictions to impose burdens that outpace the law's stated civil aims, there is room for\n\nserious argument that the ulterior purpose is to revisit past crimes, not prevent future\n\nones.\" Petitioner would suggest that if there is any question as to the real punitive basis\n\nfor sex offender registries---not to mention all the other legal restrictions pegged on to the\n\nSORAs---then one only has to listen to the hatred in the voices of those persons\n\nintroducing, or supporting, said legislations. And the Court should furthermore consider\n\nthe following: Statute 103.001 was enacted to give a financial compensation for those\n\nwrongly convicted of a crime; among its provisions is a separate one that allows financial\n\ncompensation for those who, because of a wrongful conviction, have had to report to a\n\nsex offender registry, which begs the question: if being in a sex offender registry is not\n\npunitive then why did the State legislature legislate financial compensation? The answer\n\nis obvious: because being in such a registry is punitive.\n\n       Incidentally, someone with verbal virtuosity could easily form a preamble to a\n\nlaw that amputates a jaywalker's legs, or cuts off a thief s hands, and make it sound as if\n\nthe law was not punitive, but simply for the protection of the public.\n\n       Another question that demands an answer is: if the safety of the public is really\n\nthe issue, why are there no registries for convicted thieves, or convicted murderers?\n\nIndeed, how is a statutory \"rapist\" or an exhibitionist more dangerous than a murderer?\n\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\f       On the third level is the matter of having his Constitutional rights being thrown\n\nout the window through the conditions of parole and probation. How is being prohibited\n\nfrom being with his own children not cruel and unusual punishment? Again, not being a\n\nlicensed attorney, Petitioner would dearly love to learn.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n       To reiterate the obvious, (true) sexual molestation of a child, and rape of an adult,\n\nare both heinous crimes that must be punished and should be punished harshly. No one is\n\narguing otherwise. But frequently, what passes as \"sex offenders\" are persons who have\n\nnot committed either offense, yet are treated and classified as if they had.\n\n       Additionally, granted that the above offenses occur, no one can deny that the\n\ncountry has gone through a hysteria in regards to sex offenses, said hysteria exacerbated\n\nby the mass media, particularly whenever a particularly lurid offence occurs, so that\n\nrational thinking has dissipated in this climate over this topic (Mary Pride, The Child\n\nAbuse Industry, Crossway Books, 1986).\n\n       Again, this case conclusively illustrates, as probably few others could, that being\n\nannounced to the jury at the very beginning of a trial as a \"sex offender\" guarantees a\n\nguilty verdict---regardless of the lack of evidence. \"Sentence first---verdict afterwards,\"\n\nis the motto in the courtroom in Alice in Wonderland and should be formally appended to\n\nthis law. All a prosecutor has to do in order to ensure a conviction is utter three words:\n\n\"convicted sex offender.\" This flaw is inherent in the law itself, by denying the\n\nDefendant a fair trial and is, therefore, ipso facto, un-Constitutional. \"Society wins not\n\nonly when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair; our system of the\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\fadministration of justice suffers when any accused          IS   treated unfairly.\" Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373, U.S. 83, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       Then, the question of finality comes into play here as well. In regards to habeas\n\ncorpus, for example, the matter of exhausted and unexhausted claims, as well as \"mixed .\n\npetitions, was ultimately resolved with the principal concern of the Courts achieving\n\nfinality. Coleman v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Ill s. Ct. 2546. Likewise, AEDPA was\n\ninstituted for the purpose of finality. Doe v. Menefee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788549\"><a href=\"/opinion/788549/john-doe-v-frederick-menefee-warden-warden-of-the-otisville-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. And, similarly, a\n\ndefendant cannot be retried for the same offense that an appeal court has vacated and\n\nremanded due to insufficiency of evidence, again, for the sake of achieving finality.\n\nGreene v. Massey,_437 U. S. 19, 98 S .Ct. 2151. But, for so-called \"sex offenders\" there\n\nis no finality. The punishments keep coming and coming in new and novel ways, long\n\nafter the original law was passed and time served. Every convicted \"sex offender\" is\n\nSisyphus.\n\n       Lastly, well-documented instances of vigilante acts have occurred from time to\n\ntime against persons who were found to be living in a community, as a result of there\n\nbeing a sex offender registry, and that is on top of numerous local bills of attainder.\n\n       As a result, thousands of individuals who have been labeled as a \"sex offender\"\n\nand who paid their debt to society, have made the rational choice to go underground and\n\nassume a different identity since they feel that society has made living a normal law-\n\nabiding life to be an impossibility. And why should they not do so? It is so simple. By\n\ntaking a few elementary precautions and assuming a new identity, a person does not have\n\nto live under a bridge exposed to the elements, or live in a dump where he will be forever\n\nsubject to persecution by all and sundry. To conform to what is demanded is simply\n\n\n\n                                             38\n\fabsurd, a no-win scenario. In this regard, it is amusing, in a perverse way, to read the\n\ninterpretations as to why so many thousands have \"disappeared\" when the high courts\n\nhave discussed SORAs, e.g., in Carr v. US., supra; Reynolds v. U S., supra; U S. v.\n\nKebodeaux, supra. The implied reason by the justices has been simply delusional as to\n\nwhy they dropped out of sight: that they have done so in order to commit additional\n\ncrimes---as if being in a registry somehow eliminates the impulse to commit a crime.\n\nThose defenders of registries have the delusional fantasy that \"sex offenders\" who have\n\navoided registration are now lurking around comers and in shadows everywhere looking\n\nfor victims. In reality, they are now living ordinary, mundane, boring, law-abiding lives.\n\nFinally.\n\n           And, in the end, Petitioner is faced with the uncomfortable question: why, indeed,\n\nshould he not also simply go underground, disappear, and thereby lead a normal, stress-\n\nfree, mundane otherwise law-abiding life?

I, personally, do not see the\n Constitutional basis for such a challenge. However, I can see how the original\n term of \"sexual assault\" is a misnomer when the sex was described as consensual\n between myself and a teenage girl 28 years ago and could conceivably be brought\n into play.

It is due April 3rd.\n Although you did do a fairly good job representing yourself, there are a few issues that I need to address with\n you and explain why all the issues you would like to raise will not and cannot be raised.\n 1. The issue of the prosecutor bringing up the facts of your previous case: You did not object when it was\n brought up. I also do not see in the record that any judge ruled on your motion in limine, however a motion in\n limine is virtually meaningless unless you properly object and raise the issue during the trial. You did not do\n this. If you don't object at the proper time, you waive the issue for appeal.\n 2. Prosecutor brought up details of prior case: Although it was a good motion for a mistrial, you failed to object\n to a document that the State introduced into evidence with details of the previous conviction i.e. the document\n said the girls age, etc. Because that evidence was before the jury AND because you did not object, the issue\n was waived.\n 3. No direct Evidence -this issue is called a \"sufficiency of the evidence complain\" and I am raising this issue\n on your behalf.\n 4. Attacking the Texas approach to grand juries: you failed to raise this issue pre-trial and now you cannot\n raise it on appeal.\n 5. Officer Hermosillo's testimony should be thrown out: This should have been addressed pre-trial and at the\n time that he tstified. You waived this issue on appeal by not properly raising it at the trial level.\n 6. Excessive punishment: Considering you received probation, an 8th amendment excessive punishment\n argument is not valid on appeal. Much of the research on this issue that I have done shows that many men\n who went to trial and were convicted of the same offense received prison sentences.\n\n Your other issues labeled A-C in your letter are also not valid to raise on appeal because they were not\n properly preserved in the trial court.\n\n I have raised 3 issues all relating to the issue of whether the evidence was sufficient to prove you committed\n the alleged crime. In order to violate the change of address requirements, the state had to prove you 1. were\n required to register (which they did) and 2. that you failed to report 7 days before your intended move or 7 days\n after moving. The law also provides that someone who is homeless must only report once every 30 days and it\n also provides for people who do not actually move to an intended residence on an anticipated day are required\n to report only weekly. Neither of these provisions require in person. Thus the state did not prove that you\n intended to move on any particular date and therefore you did not fail to report 7 days prior. I also do not think\n they proved you actually changed addresses. Finally, I think you were in compliance with the reporting\n requirements for homeless people.\n\n However, where I think we still may lose is the fact that after leaving the residence were you required to report\n in person to state that you were homeless? And then you only had to report monthly after that? I think the law\n is not exactly clear and will be left to the court's interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://rnail.aol.com/webrnail-std/en-us/PrintMessage                                                     3/20/2015\n\fFwd: Appeal Draft                                                                                       Page 2 of2\n\n\n Again, the draft is rough and needs fine tuning, but I wanted to give you time to look over the issues raised\n before it gets filed on April 3.\n\n Thanks,\n\n Dayna\n\n\n Dayna L.

The Live Oak Police Department considers all complaints of officer misconduct a serious\n              matter and they are thoroughly investigated. The findings of the investigation are stated below.\n\n                        The officer observed a vehicle being operated with a defective headlamp which is probable cause\n              for the traffic stop. Upon contacting and identifying you as the driver and running your driver's license it\n              was discovered that you are a registered sex offender. After you were unable to provide a current\n              address the officer continued the investigation in an attempt to make certain that you were meeting your\n              obligation to provide a change of address as directed by law. The officer also wished to check the welfare\n              of the children in your vehicle. Your daughter was asked who you were. When the officer was told you\n              were her father no further questions were asked of her.\n\n                     During the traffic stop and investigation you were detained a total of 18 minutes and 45 seconds. I\n            believe this to be a reasonable time for the stop and investigation. You were then issued a warning\n            requiring no payment of fine or court action for Defective Headlamp and released.\n\n                   Your subsequent arrest that evening was obviously due to you not making proper notification of\n            address change to the agency you are required to report to. The arrest had nothing to do with the fact that\n            you were stopped by a Live Oak Police Officer.\n\n                     After a review and investigation into this incident, I find no wrong doing on the part of the officer.\n            This investigation has been completed and closed. No further action will be taken by the department on\n            this matter.\n\n\n\n                        Respectfully,\n\n\n                          ;~#~\n                        Lieutenant Matt Malone\n\n                        Patrol Division Commander\n\f</pre>",
