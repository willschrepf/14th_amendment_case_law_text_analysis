Brock Hornby, United States District Judge for the District of Maine,\nsitting by designation.\n\f                Case: 11-15464       Date Filed: 01/10/2014     Page: 2 of 29\n\n\n      In the “best of all possible worlds,” 1 state and local governments would\n\nensure adequate funding for all facets of their public school systems. In the world\n\nin which we live, however, the reality is that some public school systems do not\n\nhave sufficient resources to educate the children entrusted to their care.\n\n      This appeal primarily concerns a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to\n\nvarious sections of the Alabama Constitution that are central to the State’s system\n\nof ad valorem property taxation. The plaintiffs, black and white children attending\n\npublic schools in Sumter and Lawrence Counties, filed suit in federal district court,\n\nasserting that these provisions are “rooted in [the State’s] historic racially\n\ndiscriminatory policies,” D.E. 31 at 16, and cripple the ability of certain rural,\n\nnearly all-black public school systems in Alabama to raise revenues. According to\n\nthe plaintiffs, the counties in Alabama’s so-called “Black Belt”—a poor, largely\n\nagricultural region with a significant African-American population—have been\n\ndisadvantaged under the current tax system because of “extremely low under-\n\nvaluation of farm and timber land.” Appellants’ Br. at 39. The plaintiffs further\n\nallege that Alabama’s constitutional limitations on millage rates restrict the ability\n\nof those in the “Black Belt” to raise property taxes and adequately fund public\n\nschools. See id. at 45.\n\n      The district court, following a bench trial, issued an 804-page order\n\n      1\n          VOLTAIRE, CANDIDE, Chapter I, p.4 (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition 2005) [1759].\n\n\n                                               2\n\f             Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 3 of 29\n\n\nconcluding that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the challenged provisions\n\nwere unconstitutional. The plaintiffs then filed this appeal. After reviewing the\n\nbriefs and the extensive record, and with the benefit of oral argument, we affirm in\n\npart, and remand with instructions to dismiss without prejudice in part for lack of\n\nstanding.\n\n                                          I\n\n      Alabama’s property tax system is no stranger to the Eleventh Circuit. As the\n\ndistrict court noted, the current case is “a sequel to [a] long-running, higher-\n\neducation desegregation action” initially filed in 1981. See D.E. 35 at 1.\n\n      In Knight v. Alabama, 476 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir. 2007), a different\n\ngroup of plaintiffs sought to establish a link between property tax limits for K-12\n\neducation funding and persistent segregation in Alabama’s higher education\n\nsystem. Knight was initially styled as a higher education desegregation case, but\n\nthe plaintiffs eventually sought to transform the case into a challenge to Alabama’s\n\ntax policies. See id. at 1229. We ultimately determined on appeal that “even if\n\nunderfunding of Alabama’s K-12 schools were related to segregation in its colleges\n\nand universities, this relationship [wa]s too attenuated and rest[ed] on too many\n\nunpredictable premises to entitle [the] plaintiffs to relief under [United States v.\n\nFordice, 505 U.S. 717 (1992)].” Knight, 476 F.3d at 1228.\n\n      We further noted in Knight that the plaintiffs’ request for so-called\n\n\n                                          3\n\f              Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 4 of 29\n\n\n“additional relief”—an injunction requiring the Alabama Legislature to adequately\n\nfund K-12 schools—was “beyond [the] case or controversy” presented in that\n\nlitigation. See id. at 1229 n.19 (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiffs\n\nin the current action apparently interpreted this language in Knight as an invitation\n\nto bring a separate lawsuit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory property tax restrictions in Alabama’s Constitution. See Complaint\n\nat ¶ 6. See also Appellants’ Br. at 3 (“[P]laintiff K-12 students were acting on the\n\ninvitation of the district court and this Court in Knight v. Alabama[.]”).\n\n      The parties agree that the plaintiffs’ current challenges, to the extent\n\njusticiable, are governed by the standards described in Hunter v. Underwood, 471\n\nU.S. 222 (1985). See Appellants’ Br. at 46, 56-57, 73-74; Appellees’ Br. at 30, 33,\n\n35.   A facially neutral state law will not be struck down as unconstitutional\n\n“because it results in a racially disproportionate impact. . . . Proof of racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent or purpose is required.” See Hunter, 471 U.S. at 227-28\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). See also id. at 229-33 (holding that a provision\n\nof the Alabama Constitution of 1901, which disenfranchised persons convicted of\n\ncrimes involving moral turpitude, violated equal protection because, even though\n\nthe provision was racially neutral, its enactment was motivated by a desire to\n\ndiscriminate against blacks on account of race and had a racially discriminatory\n\neffect). As we summarized in Young Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, 529 F.3d\n\n\n                                           4\n\f             Case: 11-15464      Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 5 of 29\n\n\n1027, 1043-45 (11th Cir. 2008), a law that is neutral on its face violates the Equal\n\nProtection Clause if discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\ngovernment’s enactment of the law, and if the government cannot show that the\n\nlaw would have been enacted in the absence of any discriminatory motive.\n\n“[U]nless there is a clear pattern that [the law] is impacting one race more than\n\nanother, impact alone is not determinative[.]” Id. at 1045.\n\n      The district court found that four of the challenged provisions in the\n\nAlabama Constitution (Sections 214, 215, and 216 of Article XI and Section 269 of\n\nArticle XIV) were “enacted with a racially discriminatory intent,” but that two later\n\namendments to another provision of the Alabama Constitution (Amendments 325\n\nand 373 to Section 217 of Article XI) were primarily motivated by financial\n\nconsiderations. See D.E. 296-1 at 775-76. The district court further found that, on\n\na statewide basis, “Alabama’s black citizens and black public school students\n\n[were] not disparately impacted by the challenged provisions.” Id. at 779.\n\n      Our discussion of this complicated case is divided into three parts. First, we\n\nconsider whether the plaintiffs have standing for the various claims they assert.\n\nSecond, we address Alabama’s contention that the action is barred by the Tax\n\nInjunction Act and principles of comity. Finally, we conclude with the merits of\n\nthe claims properly before us.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f              Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 6 of 29\n\n\n                                          II\n\n      Alabama argues, as it did below, that the plaintiffs lack standing. Standing\n\nis one of the Article III case or controversy requirements, see Stalley ex rel. U.S. v.\n\nOrlando Reg’l Healthcare Sys., Inc., 524 F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir. 2008), and\n\nmust therefore be established “as a threshold matter,” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a\n\nBetter Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).          To have standing, the plaintiffs must\n\ndemonstrate injury in fact, causation, and redressability. See, e.g., DiMaio v.\n\nDemocratic Nat’l Comm., 520 F.3d 1299, 1301-02 (11th Cir. 2008). Failure to\n\nsatisfy any of these three requirements is fatal. See Fla. Wildlife Fed., Inc. v. S.\n\nFla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 647 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011).\n\n      We review the plaintiffs’ standing de novo. See DiMaio, 520 F.3d at 1301.\n\nThe State contends that the plaintiffs lack a cognizable injury and cannot show that\n\nany alleged injury would be redressed by the relief they request. See Appellees’\n\nBr. at 17-21. We disagree with the first contention, but concur in part with the\n\nsecond.\n\n                                          A\n\n      An injury in fact is “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a)\n\nconcrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\n\nhypothetical.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted). In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege that\n\n\n                                          6\n\f              Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014    Page: 7 of 29\n\n\n“racially discriminatory property tax restrictions in the Alabama Constitution . . .\n\nimpede their ability and the ability of their elected representatives to raise state and\n\nlocal revenues adequately to fund . . . public education.” Complaint at ¶ 7. The\n\nState argues, however, that this injury does not “affect the plaintiff[s] in a personal\n\nand individual way,” as required by Article III. See Appellees’ Br. at 19 (quoting\n\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1).\n\n      We conclude, contrary to the State’s position, that impediments to public\n\neducation funding arising from racially discriminatory state laws can constitute\n\nparticularized and concrete injury for purposes of standing. See, e.g., Petrella v.\n\nBrownback, 697 F.3d 1285, 1293 (10th Cir. 2012) (holding that alleged intentional\n\nunderfunding of a school district constituted an injury in fact for purposes of\n\nArticle III standing).    Under Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent,\n\ndiscriminatory governmental action of the type alleged here constitutes an Article\n\nIII injury. See Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 739-40 (1984) (noting that\n\ndiscriminatory government action resulting in noneconomic injury to the plaintiff\n\ncan support standing); Common Cause/Ga. v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1351 (11th\n\nCir. 2009) (“For purposes of standing, a denial of equal treatment is an actual\n\ninjury even when the complainant is able to overcome the challenged barrier[.]”).\n\nCf. United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 744-45 (1995) (upholding standing for a\n\nplaintiff who resided in a district allegedly created through racial gerrymandering);\n\n\n                                           7\n\f             Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 8 of 29\n\n\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 756 (1984) (recognizing the “diminished ability to\n\nreceive an education in a racially integrated school” as a judicially cognizable\n\ninjury).\n\n                                         B\n\n      A more difficult question is whether this alleged injury is redressable\n\nthrough the relief sought. The Supreme Court has described redressability as “a\n\nsubstantial likelihood that the relief requested will redress the injury claimed.”\n\nDuke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75 n.20 (1978)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Redressability is admittedly one of the more\n\namorphous requirements of modern standing doctrine. See Gene R. Nichol, Jr.,\n\nRethinking Standing, 72 CAL. L. REV. 68, 72 n.27 (1984) (noting fluctuations and\n\ninconsistencies in the application of the redressability requirement). Nonetheless,\n\nit remains part of the “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,” Lujan, 504\n\nU.S. at 560, and this case can only proceed if the plaintiffs have shown that the\n\nrequested injunctive relief would likely resolve their inability to adequately raise\n\nrevenue for public education. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 504 (1975). See\n\nalso Allen, 468 U.S. at 753 n.19 (explaining that redressibility “examines the\n\ncausal connection between the alleged injury and the judicial relief requested”).\n\n      As noted earlier, the plaintiffs seek to invalidate several sections of the\n\nAlabama Constitution that allegedly inhibit adequate funding of public education.\n\n\n                                         8\n\f                Case: 11-15464        Date Filed: 01/10/2014        Page: 9 of 29\n\n\nThese sections can be classified into two types: millage caps (which limit the tax\n\nrate) and property classifications (which determine the property valuation rate used\n\nto calculate the amount of tax due). Because standing cannot be “dispensed in\n\ngross,” see Davis v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008), we address\n\nstanding for each category of claims separately. See also Friends of the Earth, Inc.\n\nv. Laidlaw Envtl. Svcs., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000) (“[P]laintiff[s] must demonstrate\n\nstanding separately for each form of relief sought.”).\n\n                                                 1\n\n       Sections 214, 215, and 216 of Article XI of the Alabama Constitution set\n\nmillage caps that limit the tax rate various government entities may impose on\n\nproperty. 2 Alabama’s tax rate is expressed in “mills,” with one mill representing\n\n$1.00 of tax per $1,000 of assessed property value. Section 214 limits the State’s\n\nrate of ad valorem taxation to 6.5 mills; Section 215 limits a county’s rate to 5\n\nmills; and Section 216 limits a municipality’s rate to 5 mills. Section 269 of\n\nArticle XIV limits the rate that counties can levy in ad valorem taxes to support\n\n\n       2\n          Section 214 provides that “[t]he legislature shall not have the power to levy in any one\nyear a greater rate of taxation than sixty-five one-hundredths of one per centum on the value of\nthe taxable property within this state.” ALA. CONST. Art. XI, § 214. Section 215 states, in\nrelevant part, that “[n]o county in this state shall be authorized to levy a greater rate of taxation\nin any one year on the value of the taxable property therein than one-half of one per centum.”\nALA. CONST. Art. XI, § 215. Under Section 216, “[n]o city, town, village, or other municipal\ncorporation . . . shall levy or collect a higher rate of taxation in any one year on the property\nsituated therein than one-half of one per centum of the value of such property as assessed for\nstate taxation during the preceding year.” ALA. CONST. Art. XI, § 216.\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f               Case: 11-15464        Date Filed: 01/10/2014       Page: 10 of 29\n\n\neducation and further requires a referendum to approve such a tax.3 Significantly,\n\nmillage rate increases require legislative and voter approval. See ALA. CONST. Art.\n\nXI, § 217(f).        See also Bruce P. Ely & Howard P. Walthall, Sr., State\n\nConstitutional Limitations on Taxing and Spending: A Comparison of the Alabama\n\nConstitution of 1901 to Its Counterparts, 33 CUMB. L. REV. 463, 490 (2002-2003)\n\n(“Even though Amendment 373(f) attempted to provide a mechanism by which the\n\npeople of a county or other taxing authority could decide to increase their tax rates\n\nwithout amending the Constitution, that provision still requires that they first take\n\nthe question to the Legislature for approval.”).\n\n       “Relief that does not remedy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff\n\ninto federal court[.]” Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 107. We conclude that removal of the\n\nmillage caps found in Sections 214, 215, and 216 of Article XI and Section 269 of\n\nArticle XIV—the remedy the plaintiffs seek—will not redress the asserted injury,\n\nwhich at bottom is the inability of the plaintiffs and their elected officials to raise\n\nstate and local revenue for public education. As we previously noted in Knight,\n\n“[i]t is not at all clear that the removal of Alabama’s constitutional restrictions on\n\n\n       3\n          Section 269 provides, in relevant part, as follows: “The several counties in this state\nshall have power to levy and collect a special tax not exceeding ten cents on each one hundred\ndollars of taxable property in such counties, for the support and furtherance of education in such\nmanner as may be authorized by the legislature; provided, that the rate of such tax, the time it is\nto continue, and the purpose thereof, shall have been first submitted to a vote of the qualified\nelectors of the county, and voted for by three-fifths of those voting at such election[.]” ALA.\nCONST. Art. XIV, § 269.\n\n\n                                                10\n\f             Case: 11-15464    Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 11 of 29\n\n\nproperty tax rates will necessarily result in either increased tax rates or increased\n\ntax revenues.” Knight, 476 F.3d at 1227.\n\n      First, it is undisputed that further legislation is necessary to achieve higher\n\nmillage rates, and “the contingency of [legislative] action makes the redress of\n\nplaintiffs’ injury . . . speculative.” Medina v. Clinton, 86 F.3d 155, 158 (9th Cir.\n\n1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).      The Alabama Legislature (and the\n\npeople of Alabama) may choose to raise millage rates absent the caps, just as they\n\nmay choose to maintain the status quo or lower the rates, and we can only guess as\n\nto whether removal of the current millage caps will redress the plaintiffs’ injury.\n\nSee Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (“[I]t must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely\n\n‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’”). See\n\nalso Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l U.S.A., 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1150 (2013) (“[W]e have\n\nbeen reluctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how\n\nindependent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment.”).\n\n      Second, the record indicates that Alabama voters in Lawrence and Sumter\n\nCounties, where the plaintiffs reside, have rejected various proposals to increase\n\nproperty taxes. See D.E. 242-1 at ¶ 38 (d), (f). As the district court noted,\n\n“Alabama has authorized all local school systems to levy up to an aggregate of\n\n15.0 mills in ad valorem property taxes for educational purposes, in a combination\n\nof county and school tax district taxes.” D.E. 296 at 160.

Lawrence County\n\nlevies property taxes at 10 mills, and Sumter County levies them at 13.8 mills. See\n\nid. at 167. Given that neither municipality has levied the maximum generally\n\nauthorized taxes for education, we conclude that an injunction prohibiting\n\nenforcement of the millage caps will not likely redress the plaintiffs’ injury.\n\n      We note, as well, the acknowledgment of plaintiffs’ counsel at oral argument\n\nthat removal of the constitutional millage caps “may or may not” result in higher\n\nmillage rates.    This uncertainty reinforces our conclusion that granting the\n\nplaintiffs the relief they request would result in nothing more than a mere “moral”\n\nvictory, something the federal courts may not properly provide. See Steel Co., 523\n\nU.S. at 107 (“[A]lthough a suitor may derive great comfort and joy from the fact\n\nthat . . . a wrongdoer gets his just deserts, or that the Nation’s laws are faithfully\n\nenforced, that psychic satisfaction is not an acceptable Article III remedy because\n\nit does not redress a cognizable Article III injury.”).\n\n      The plaintiffs attempted to overcome the redressability conundrum at oral\n\nargument by labeling their requested relief more simply as the elimination of\n\nhistorical barriers, rather than an affirmative attempt to increase millage rates.\n\nThis characterization, however, is ultimately unavailing. Under current standing\n\ndoctrine, we must consider the requested relief in the context of the injury that it\n\npurports to redress. The plaintiffs’ injury is not simply the existence of the alleged\n\n\n                                           12\n\f             Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014    Page: 13 of 29\n\n\nbarriers, but the resulting impact of those barriers on the ability to adequately fund\n\neducation in Alabama’s so-called Black Belt. Cf. Arizona Christian Sch. v. Winn,\n\n131 S. Ct. 1436, 1448 (2011) (“And while an injunction against application of the\n\ntax credit most likely would reduce contributions to [school tuition organizations],\n\nthat remedy would not affect noncontributing taxpayers or their tax payments. As\n\na result, any injury suffered by respondents would not be remedied by an\n\ninjunction limiting the tax credit’s operation.”). That the barriers were allegedly\n\nput in place for a discriminatory purpose is not sufficient, in and of itself, to confer\n\nstanding. See Allen, 468 U.S. at 754 (“[A]n asserted right to have the Government\n\nact in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction\n\non a federal court.”). As we have explained, removal of the millage caps is not\n\nlikely to result in an increased ability to fund public education. See Hollingsworth\n\nv. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652, 2661 (2013) (“[F]or a federal court to have authority\n\nunder the Constitution to settle a dispute, the party before it must seek a remedy for\n\na personal and tangible harm.”).\n\n                                           2\n\n      Amendments 325 and 373 to Section 217 of Article XI, however, are\n\nanother matter entirely. These Amendments establish a property classification\n\nsystem for determining the value of the property that is subject to a given tax rate.\n\nSee Howell v. Malone, 388 So. 2d 908, 913 (Ala. 1980) (noting that Amendment\n\n                                          13\n\f              Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014    Page: 14 of 29\n\n\n325 “change[d] the uniformity and equality among taxpayers to provide for three\n\nclasses of property and to establish three different ratios of taxation for the three\n\nseparate classes,” and summarizing the subsequent property classification scheme\n\nimposed under Amendment 373).              Under these provisions, certain classes of\n\nproperty are assessed only at a percentage of their total value. Class III property,\n\nwhich includes agricultural, forest, and single-family residential property, is taxed\n\nat the lowest possible rate: 10% of its value. Class III property owners also may\n\nhave their property assessed at “current use” value rather than fair market value.\n\nAs amended, therefore, Section 217 “severely limit[s] the value of property subject\n\nto the millage rates.” Susan Pace Hamill, Constitutional Reform in Alabama: A\n\nNecessary Step Towards Achieving a Fair and Efficient Tax Structure, 33 CUMB.\n\nL. REV. 437, 445 (2002-2003).            And because property is assessed at only a\n\npercentage of its actual value, “very little of the property’s true fair market value\n\n[is] subject to taxation.” Id. at 443.\n\n      As the district court noted, it was “undisputed that the immediate effect of\n\ngranting the declaratory judgment and injunction plaintiffs seek [with respect to\n\nSection 217] w[ould] be to increase property taxes in the State of Alabama.” D.E.\n\n35 at 31 (footnote omitted). See also D.E. 296 at 112. If the assessment ratios\n\nestablished by Section 217 did not exist, the record indicates that the property in\n\nquestion would be assessed at 100% of its value, rather than at the 10% to 30%\n\n\n                                             14\n\f               Case: 11-15464       Date Filed: 01/10/2014       Page: 15 of 29\n\n\ncurrently allowed. See D.E. 296 at 112 n.242. And that scenario, as the district\n\ncourt found, of course would necessarily result in more tax revenue for Alabama,\n\nat least some of which could be used to fund public education. Id. at 111, 113.4\n\nWe therefore conclude that removing the assessment ratios would likely redress (at\n\nleast in part) the plaintiffs’ injury, and that is enough for standing purposes. See\n\nMade in the USA Foundation v. United States, 242 F.3d 1300, 1310-11 (11th Cir.\n\n2001) (relief which remedies at least some of the alleged injuries is sufficient to\n\nestablish redressability).\n\n       Because we conclude that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the\n\nmillage cap provisions (Sections 214, 215, and 216 of Article XI and Section 269\n\nof Article XIV), the remainder of our discussion focuses solely on Amendments\n\n325 and 373 to Section 217.\n\n                                               III\n\n       Alabama argues that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, deprived the\n\ndistrict court of jurisdiction over this case. It also contends that principles of\n\ncomity preclude the exercise of federal court jurisdiction. We begin with the Tax\n\nInjunction Act, and then turn to comity.\n\n       4\n          There is some suggestion in the record that invalidating the assessment ratios would not\nlead to property being assessed at 100%, but instead would result in a 60% assessment ratio for\nall property. See D.E. 31 at 18 (citing Weissinger v. Boswell, 330 F. Supp. 615, 619 n.9, 625\n(M.D. Ala. 1971)). In any event, the result would be increased tax revenue, which could at least\npartially redress the plaintiffs’ injury.\n\n\n                                               15\n\f              Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014     Page: 16 of 29\n\n\n                                           A\n\n      The Tax Injunction Act is a “jurisdictional rule” and constitutes a “broad\n\njurisdictional barrier.” Moe v. Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes of Flathead\n\nReservation, 425 U.S. 463, 470 (1976).              We review the district court’s\n\ninterpretation of the Act de novo, and its factual findings regarding jurisdiction for\n\nclear error. See Amos v. Glynn Cnty. Bd. of Tax Assessors, 347 F.3d 1249, 1255\n\n(11th Cir. 2003).\n\n      Although the Act is brief and to the point—it states that “[t]he district courts\n\nshall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax\n\nunder State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the\n\ncourts of such State”—its scope is somewhat unsettled. Guided by a relatively\n\nrecent Supreme Court decision, Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88 (2004), we agree with\n\nthe district court that the Act does not bar this action.\n\n      In Hibbs, the Supreme Court distinguished between “taxpayer claims that\n\nwould reduce state revenues and third-party claims that would enlarge state\n\nreceipts.” Id. at 108. The latter category of claims, the Court held, does not\n\nimplicate the Tax Injunction Act because such claims do not “seek to impede [a\n\nstate’s] receipt of tax revenues.” Id. at 93. As the Court explained, the Act was\n\nnot intended to “insulate state tax laws from constitutional challenge in lower\n\nfederal courts even when the suit would have no negative impact on tax\n\n\n                                           16\n\f              Case: 11-15464    Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 17 of 29\n\n\ncollection.” Id. at 94.\n\n      As we read it, Hibbs at the very least stands for the proposition that third-\n\nparty challenges to the validity of state taxing schemes fall outside the ambit of the\n\nTax Injunction Act if the challenges, were they to prove successful, would result in\n\nthe increase of the tax liabilities of others (and therefore an increase in tax\n\nrevenues to the state). Compare id. at 104 (“Third-party suits not seeking to stop\n\nthe collection (or contest the validity) of a tax imposed on plaintiffs . . . were\n\noutside Congress’ purview.”), with id. at 106 (Act bars jurisdiction if federal court\n\nrelief would “operate[ ] . . . to reduce the flow of state tax revenue”). This is\n\nessentially how the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have read\n\nHibbs. See Henderson v. Stolver, 407 F.3d 351, 359 (5th Cir. 2005); Johnson v.\n\nOrr, 551 F.3d 564, 571 (7th Cir. 2008); City of Jefferson City v. Cingular Wireless,\n\nLLC, 531 F.3d 595, 603-04 (8th Cir. 2008); May Trucking Co. v. Oregon Dept. of\n\nTransp., 388 F.3d 1261, 1267 (9th Cir. 2004); Hill v. Kemp, 478 F.3d 1236, 1249\n\n& n.12 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n      This appeal presents us with our first opportunity to apply Hibbs in a\n\npublished decision. The district court concluded, based on Hibbs, that the Tax\n\nInjunction Act did not divest it of jurisdiction because “[t]he undisputed, direct\n\neffect of the requested injunction would be to increase property tax revenue.” D.E.\n\n296 at 113.     In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied in part on\n\n\n                                         17\n\f               Case: 11-15464        Date Filed: 01/10/2014        Page: 18 of 29\n\n\nAlabama’s own concession that the requested injunction would lead to significant\n\nincreases in property taxes, potentially as high as 1,000%. See D.E. 296 at 113 &\n\nn. 238.5\n\n       On appeal, the State has changed its jurisdictional tune, and now argues that\n\n“prohibiting enforcement of [its] property-valuation scheme (Amendments 325 and\n\n373 and their implementing statutes and regulations) could take a . . . detrimental\n\ntoll on public revenue collections” because “tax officials in all jurisdictions may\n\nwell be powerless to issue property valuations,” and “without valid property\n\nvaluations, they would be powerless to collect any property tax at all.” Appellees’\n\nBr. at 24-25. Alabama’s newly-minted factual maybes, however, do not require\n\nreversal of the district court’s jurisdictional ruling as to the Tax Injunction Act.\n\n       As an initial matter, whether tax revenues would rise or fall if the plaintiffs\n\nsucceed on their challenges to Amendments 325 and 373 is a matter that is at least\n\npartly factual in nature, and we as an appellate tribunal are not in the business of\n\nfact-finding. Although we recognize that we have an obligation to address subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction questions even when raised for the first time on appeal,\n       5\n          The State’s concession in the district court read as follows: “If Plaintiffs are successful\nin challenging the restrictions on assessment ratios in Amendment 373 to the Alabama\nConstitution, and an injunction is issued, property in every classification would automatically be\nassessed at 100%, as opposed to the 10%, 20%, and 30% current ratios for residential,\ncommercial, and utility property, respectively. . . . By way of example, Alabama taxpayers with\na $100,000 home in a county with a property tax rate of 50 mills would see their annual property\ntax bill increase from $300 to $3,000, after taking into account the homestead exemption and the\nchange in assessment ratio.” D.E. 27 at 2 n.1. See also id. at 26 (“[I]t is certainly plausible that\ntax revenues would increase . . . .”).\n\n\n                                                 18\n\f               Case: 11-15464        Date Filed: 01/10/2014        Page: 19 of 29\n\n\nAlabama offers us no reason why we should second-guess the district court’s\n\nfindings as to jurisdictional facts. The district court and the plaintiffs alike were\n\nentitled to rely on Alabama’s factual concession that taxes would rise if the court\n\nenjoined enforcement of Amendment 373 and to believe, given that concession,\n\nthat no further evidence on the issue was needed. “Consent of parties cannot give\n\nthe courts of the United States jurisdiction, but the parties may admit the existence\n\nof facts which show jurisdiction, and the courts may act judicially upon such an\n\nadmission.” Ry. Co. v. Ramsey, 89 U.S. 322, 327 (1874). See also Estate of\n\nAmergi ex rel. Amergi v. Palestinian Authority, 611 F.3d 1350, 1359 (11th Cir.\n\n2010) (“litigants are sometimes held to concessions or admissions of fact they\n\nmake before a district court”) (collecting cases). In short, the State told the district\n\ncourt that taxes would increase if the plaintiffs prevailed, and it has offered no\n\nvalid reason why it should be allowed to backtrack on this factual concession\n\nnow.6\n\n        In any event, we cannot say on this record that the district court’s factual\n\nfinding as to the impact of the plaintiffs’ action on state revenues was clearly\n\n\n        6\n          We remind counsel that, as officers of the court, they have a duty to raise alleged\ndefects in subject-matter jurisdiction when they first become apparent, not merely when doing so\nbecomes strategically expedient. See Aves ex rel. Aves v. Shah, 997 F.2d 762, 767 (10th Cir.\n1993) (“[W]hile subject matter jurisdiction enjoys a special status . . . as an officer of the court,\ncandor and honesty are not only expected, they are demanded. The ‘tactic’ of [stipulating to\nsubject-matter jurisdiction at the district court], while planning to challenge jurisdiction if an\nappeal becomes necessary, will not be tolerated.”).\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f             Case: 11-15464    Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 20 of 29\n\n\nerroneous. The State’s new position that tax revenues might decrease is not based\n\non any record evidence. Rather, the argument hinges on Alabama’s unsupported\n\nassumption that Section 217 is the source of the State’s authority to issue property\n\nvaluations. Based solely on a concurring opinion in a decision of the Alabama\n\nSupreme Court, see Ex Parte James, 836 So. 2d 813, 830 (Ala. 2002) (Houston, J.,\n\nconcurring) (“[T]he rule of automatic revival of predecessor statutes is not\n\nsimilarly applicable to the revival of constitutional provisions.”), Alabama asserts\n\nthat invalidation of Section 217 would render “all jurisdictions . . . powerless to\n\nissue property valuations.” Appellees’ Br. at 25. But that concurring opinion is\n\ntoo slender a reed on which to conclusively predict what would happen under the\n\nAlabama Constitution were the assessment ratios to be invalidated.\n\n      Indeed, Alabama points to no language in the challenged Amendments and\n\nto no case law suggesting that Section 217 is the only source of the State’s power\n\nto issue valid property valuations. To the contrary, under Alabama law, “taxing\n\npower . . . has always been inherent in the State, and vested in the legislative\n\nbranch of State government,” subject only to the limitations found in the State\n\nConstitution. See W. S. Brewbaker, Inc. v. City of Montgomery, 119 So. 2d 887,\n\n891 (Ala. 1959) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the State’s power to\n\ntax is plenary, we see no reason to treat Section 217 as conferring power on the\n\nState to issue property valuations. See id. (holding that Section 216 is not a grant\n\n\n                                        20\n\f             Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014    Page: 21 of 29\n\n\nof the power to levy taxes, but instead is a limit on the State’s inherent taxing\n\npower). In sum, we find no support (and certainly no conclusive support) for the\n\nState’s argument that enjoining enforcement of Amendments 325 and 373 would\n\n“halt[ ] all property tax collections” in Alabama by stripping all jurisdictions of the\n\npower necessary to issue valid property valuations. Cf. Duke Power Co., 438 U.S.\n\nat 78 (“Nothing in our prior cases requires a party seeking to invoke federal\n\njurisdiction to negate . . . speculative or hypothetical possibilities.”) (discussing\n\nArticle III standing). The plaintiffs’ challenges to Amendments 325 and 373 to\n\nSection 217 are not barred by the Tax Injunction Act.\n\n      Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion in Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc.,\n\n560 U.S. 413 (2010), undermines this conclusion. To the extent Levin opines on\n\nthe scope of the Tax Injunction Act at all, it does so only in dicta. See id. at 432\n\n(“Because we conclude that the comity doctrine justifies dismissal of respondents’\n\nfederal-court action, we need not decide whether the TIA would itself block the\n\nsuit.”). And that dicta, in any event, supports our holding that the Act does not bar\n\nthe plaintiffs’ challenges to Section 217. As the Supreme Court explained in\n\nLevin, “Hibbs held that the TIA d[oes] not preclude a federal challenge by a third\n\nparty who object[s] to a tax credit received by others, but in no way object[s] to her\n\nown liability under any revenue-raising tax provision.”         Id. at 430.    That is\n\nprecisely the case here.\n\n\n                                          21\n\f               Case: 11-15464   Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 22 of 29\n\n\n                                             B\n\n      In the district court and in its brief on appeal, Alabama raised comity as a\n\nthreshold defense. Relying on Levin, 560 U.S. at 429-32, it asserted that comity\n\n“bar[s] federal-court interference in ‘every case’ concerning state ‘fiscal\n\noperations’ where state courts offer an adequate forum for vindicating the ‘asserted\n\nfederal right.’” Appellees’ Br. at 27 (quoting Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U.S. 521,\n\n525 (1932)).\n\n      We need not express any view on Alabama’s comity argument. During oral\n\nargument, counsel for the State told us the following: “[E]ven if the court is\n\npersuaded by comity, we would especially ask [you], in light of the expense the\n\nState has gone to, to reach the merits and affirm.” Upon further questioning by the\n\npanel, counsel indicated that Alabama preferred not to prevail on comity grounds\n\nalone because such a ruling would presumably invite (or at least permit) state-court\n\nlitigation of the same issues. We construe these statements by counsel as a request\n\nby Alabama to abandon its comity argument on appeal. Because comity is not\n\njurisdictional in nature, see Levin, 560 U.S. at 433-34 (Thomas, J., concurring), the\n\nState is free to withdraw the comity argument, and we grant its request to do so.\n\nCf. Cosby v. Jones, 682 F.2d 1373, 1376 n.6 (11th Cir. 1982) (“Because the basis\n\nof exhaustion is comity and not jurisdiction, exhaustion of state remedies may be\n\nwaived by the state.”) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                             22\n\f              Case: 11-15464    Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 23 of 29\n\n\n                                         IV\n\n        We finally turn to the merits of the challenges to Amendments 325 and 373\n\nto Section 217, the only claims that are justiciable. As an initial matter, we deem it\n\nunnecessary to independently review the constitutionality of Amendment 325,\n\nwhich established Alabama’s property classification system for taxation in 1972.\n\nSee Hamill, Constitutional Reform in Alabama, 33 CUMB. L. REV. at 442 n.16.\n\nAmendment 325 was superseded in 1978 by Amendment 373, see State v. Colonial\n\nPipeline Co., 471 So. 2d 408, 410 (Ala. Civ. App. 1984), and is no longer\n\noperative. The plaintiffs presumably challenged both Amendments because of the\n\npossibility that invalidation of Amendment 373 would revive Amendment 325\n\nunder Alabama law. Cf. Deputy Sheriffs Law Enforcement Assoc. v. Mobile Cnty.,\n\n590 So. 2d 239, 242-43 (Ala. 1991) (noting that Alabama law recognizes the\n\nprinciple of revival of predecessor statutes wherein “the very act of declaring a\n\nstatute unconstitutional brings the predecessor statute . . . back into full force”).\n\nBecause we affirm the district court’s ruling on the constitutionality of Amendment\n\n373, however, there is no possibility that the principle of revival will come into\n\nplay.\n\n        To prevail on their constitutional challenge to Amendment 373, the plaintiffs\n\nwere required to prove not only discriminatory impact, but also racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent or purpose.      See Hunter, 471 U.S. at 227-28; Vill. of\n\n\n                                          23\n\f               Case: 11-15464        Date Filed: 01/10/2014        Page: 24 of 29\n\n\nArlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977) (citing\n\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976)).7 “Discriminatory intent” means\n\nthat “racial discrimination [was] a substantial or motivating factor behind\n\nenactment of the law.” Hunter, 417 U.S. at 228 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA district court’s finding as to discriminatory intent is a factual one that cannot be\n\nset aside unless it “is clearly erroneous, is based on clearly erroneous subsidiary\n\nfindings of fact, or is based on an erroneous view of the law.” Holton v. City of\n\nThomasville Sch. Dist., 425 F.3d 1325, 1350 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). For the reasons that follow, we discern no clear error in\n\nthe district court’s finding that Amendment 373 was not racially motivated.\n\n       The Supreme Court has observed that “[p]roving the motivation behind\n\nofficial action is often a difficult undertaking.” Hunter, 471 U.S. at 228. It has,\n\nhowever, set forth “subjects of proper inquiry in determining whether racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent existed.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268. These include\n\nthe racial “impact of the official action,” the “historical background of the\n\ndecision,” the “specific sequence of events” leading to the decision, procedural or\n\nsubstantive “departures from the normal” sequence, and “legislative or\n\n       7\n         We, like the district court, decline the plaintiffs’ invitation to apply the burden-shifting\nframework set forth in United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717 (1992), as “[t]he segregative\npolicies proscribed by Fordice govern higher education, not revenue raising.” Knight, 476 F.3d\nat 1226 (concluding that Fordice did not apply to an attack on “Alabama’s tax policies [which\nallegedly] seriously limit[ed] the ability of both the State and its counties to raise revenue from\nproperty taxes and, therefore, fund its K-12 schools”).\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f               Case: 11-15464         Date Filed: 01/10/2014        Page: 25 of 29\n\n\nadministrative history.” Id. at 266-68. The district court correctly identified and\n\napplied these factors in determining whether racially discriminatory intent existed.\n\nSee D.E. 296-1 at 421-25.8\n\n       The plaintiffs contend that the district court committed legal error by\n\nimpermissibly discounting the probative value of the historical context surrounding\n\nthe enactment of the challenged Amendments. They point to, among other things,\n\nAlabama’s long-lived hostility to the use of property taxes for funding public\n\neducation of black children. They note that the enactment of these Amendments\n\nwas embedded in, and indeed a continuation of, Governor George C. Wallace’s\n\n“popular campaign of massive resistance to school desegregation.” Appellants’\n\nBr. at 54. And they emphasize that Alabama chose to entrench its historically low\n\nproperty assessments into the Constitution—after two special sessions of the\n\nLegislature—at the “same time that nearly all whites in the Black Belt were fleeing\n\nthe public schools, leaving behind underfunded public school systems that were\n\nalmost entirely black.” Id. at 54-55. See also id. at 60 (“Governor Wallace told\n\nprivate school patrons in Bibb County: ‘I think it’s a horrible thing that you people\n\nhave to pay taxes to support public schools. Then you have to dig in again to pay\n\nfor quality education for your children in a private school.’”).\n\n       Any suggestion that the district court ignored or improperly discounted this\n       8\n         We do not read the district court’s opinion, as the plaintiffs do, to require either proof of\npersonal racial animus or “smoking gun” evidence.\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f              Case: 11-15464      Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 26 of 29\n\n\nevidence is belied by its exceptionally thorough discussion of Alabama’s long\n\nhistory of racial discrimination. Although the district court acknowledged that\n\nAlabama’s “racist past . . . cast long shadows,” it ultimately found that\n\nAmendments 325 and 373 were financially, and not discriminatorily, motivated.\n\nSee D.E. 296-1 at 776.        After weighing the evidence, the district court was\n\npersuaded that the Amendments “were a reaction to the increases in property\n\nappraisals and assessments mandated by the Weissinger decision, and the\n\naccompanying threat of a tremendous increase in the property taxes paid by large\n\nlandowners.”     See id. at 771.9     Evidence in the record supports this finding,\n\nincluding evidence of massive resistance to substantial property tax increases, see\n\nid. at 664, 769; heavy support from the Alabama Farm Bureau Federation, a\n\n“powerful lobbying organization,” see id. at 642, 768; D.E. 242-1 at ¶ 186; and a\n\nclash between rural and urban interests, see D.E. 242-1 at ¶ 191, 194. See also\n\nD.E. 296-1 at 679-80 (noting that Amendment 325, on its own, had been\n\ninsufficient to “protect rural interests”).\n\n       “[A] trial court’s choice between ‘two permissible views of the evidence’ is\n\nthe very essence of the clear error standard of review.” United States v. Rodriguez\n\nDe Varon, 175 F.3d 930, 945 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (quoting Anderson v. City\n\nof Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (1985)). Even if we were inclined to reach a\n      9\n          In Weissinger, decided in 1971, a district court mandated that Alabama equalize\nproperty assessments statewide. See 330 F. Supp. at 625.\n\n\n                                              26\n\f             Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 27 of 29\n\n\ndifferent conclusion as the triers of fact, the district court did not clearly err by\n\nchoosing to credit the evidence indicating that race was not a “substantial or\n\nmotivating” factor behind the property classification system.\n\n      The Supreme Court’s decision in Hunter does not mandate a different result.\n\nThere, the Court held that the district court’s finding of no discriminatory intent in\n\nthe adoption of Section 182 of the Alabama Constitution was clearly erroneous\n\nbased on the overwhelming evidence of racial animus surrounding the\n\nConstitutional Convention of 1901. See Hunter, 471 U.S. at 225. The record not\n\nonly revealed that the Constitutional Convention was convened with the express\n\nintent of “establish[ing] white supremacy in [the] State,” but also demonstrated\n\nthat Section 182 was itself enacted with the specific intent of disenfranchising\n\nblack voters. See id. at 229, 232 (noting that “the suffrage committee selected\n\ncrimes [that would disqualify persons from registering and voting] . . . that were\n\nthought to be more commonly committed by blacks”). We by no means intend to\n\nsuggest that Hunter establishes a threshold that must be met in order to establish\n\ndiscriminatory intent; Hunter, to the contrary, was an anomalous case in that the\n\nrecord was replete with direct and overwhelming evidence of racial discrimination.\n\nAlthough Hunter does not set the floor for an evidentiary showing of\n\ndiscriminatory intent, neither does it compel a conclusion that the district court\n\nclearly erred.   Simply stated, the evidence in Hunter was quantitatively and\n\n\n                                         27\n\f                  Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014       Page: 28 of 29\n\n\nqualitatively different than the evidence here. 10\n\n                                                  V\n\n          In deciding this difficult appeal, we are cognizant of Alabama’s deep and\n\ntroubled history of racial discrimination, and given the evidence at trial, we share\n\nin the district court’s concern regarding Alabama’s public education system:\n\n          Alabama continues to be plagued by an inadequately funded public\n          school system — one that hinders the upward mobility of her citizens,\n          black and white alike, especially in rural counties. . . . [As a result,]\n          [t]he children of the rural poor, whether black or white, are left to\n          struggle as best as they can in underfunded, dilapidated schools.\nD.E. 296-1 at 797-98. Courts, however, are not always able to provide relief, no\n\nmatter how noble the cause.\n\n          Here, because the requested remedy would not redress the alleged injury, the\n\nplaintiffs lack standing to challenge the constitutional millage cap provisions\n\ndespite the district court’s finding that they were enacted with discriminatory\n\nintent.        The plaintiffs’ challenges to these provisions are therefore dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice. The plaintiffs’ challenges to the State’s property classification\n\n\n          10\n           In light of our ruling, we need not address the district court’s findings with respect to\ndiscriminatory impact. As we have noted, the plaintiffs could not succeed without proving\ndiscriminatory intent, even if discriminatory impact existed. See, e.g., Arlington Heights, 429\nU.S. at 264-65 (“Official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a\nracially disproportionate impact.”). In addition, because we conclude that the district court did\nnot clearly err in its findings on the Fourteenth Amendment claims, we affirm without further\ndiscussion the district court’s rejection of the plaintiffs’ claim under Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d\net seq. See, e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 343 (2003) (concluding that Title VI claim\n“also fail[ed]” because “the Equal Protection Clause [did] not prohibit the Law School’s\nnarrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions”).\n\n\n                                                28\n\f               Case: 11-15464   Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 29 of 29\n\n\nsystem (as set forth in Amendments 325 and 373 to Section 217) are not similarly\n\nbarred, yet these claims fail because we cannot say that the district court clearly\n\nerred in finding that this system was not the product of invidious discriminatory\n\nintent.   Although the evidence presented could have supported a finding of\n\ndiscriminatory intent, sufficient evidence also rendered permissible the district\n\ncourt’s finding that these Amendments were financially, and not discriminatorily,\n\nmotivated. Under clear-error review, we are not free to second-guess the district\n\ncourt’s choice between two permissible views of the evidence. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm in part as to the claims related to Amendments 325 and 373 to Section 217,\n\nand vacate and remand in part with instructions to dismiss, without prejudice, the\n\nclaims related to Sections 214, 215, and 216 of Article XI and Section 269 of\n\nArticle XIV.\n\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO\nDISMISS IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f",

In the world\n\nin which we live, however, the reality is that some public school systems do not\n\nhave sufficient resources to educate the children entrusted to their care.\n\n      This appeal primarily concerns a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to\n\nvarious sections of the Alabama Constitution that are central to the State’s system\n\nof ad valorem property taxation. The plaintiffs, black and white children attending\n\npublic schools in Sumter and Lawrence Counties, filed suit in federal district court,\n\nasserting that these provisions are “rooted in [the State’s] historic racially\n\ndiscriminatory policies,” D.E. 31 at 16, and cripple the ability of certain rural,\n\nnearly all-black public school systems in Alabama to raise revenues. According to\n\nthe plaintiffs, the counties in Alabama’s so-called “Black Belt”—a poor, largely\n\nagricultural region with a significant African-American population—have been\n\ndisadvantaged under the current tax system because of “extremely low under-\n\nvaluation of farm and timber land.” Appellants’ Br. at 39. The plaintiffs further\n\nallege that Alabama’s constitutional limitations on millage rates restrict the ability\n\nof those in the “Black Belt” to raise property taxes and adequately fund public\n\nschools. See id. at 45.\n\n      The district court, following a bench trial, issued an 804-page order\n\n      1\n          VOLTAIRE, CANDIDE, Chapter I, p.4 (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition 2005) [1759].\n\n\n                                               2\n\f             Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 3 of 29\n\n\nconcluding that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the challenged provisions\n\nwere unconstitutional.

As the\n\ndistrict court noted, the current case is “a sequel to [a] long-running, higher-\n\neducation desegregation action” initially filed in 1981. See D.E. 35 at 1.\n\n      In Knight v.

Knight was initially styled as a higher education desegregation case, but\n\nthe plaintiffs eventually sought to transform the case into a challenge to Alabama’s\n\ntax policies. See id. at 1229. We ultimately determined on appeal that “even if\n\nunderfunding of Alabama’s K-12 schools were related to segregation in its colleges\n\nand universities, this relationship [wa]s too attenuated and rest[ed] on too many\n\nunpredictable premises to entitle [the] plaintiffs to relief under [United States v.\n\nFordice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112782\"><a href=\"/opinion/112782/united-states-v-fordice/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992)].” Knight, 476 F.3d at 1228.\n\n      We further noted in Knight that the plaintiffs’ request for so-called\n\n\n                                          3\n\f              Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 4 of 29\n\n\n“additional relief”—an injunction requiring the Alabama Legislature to adequately\n\nfund K-12 schools—was “beyond [the] case or controversy” presented in that\n\nlitigation. See id. at 1229 n.19 (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiffs\n\nin the current action apparently interpreted this language in Knight as an invitation\n\nto bring a separate lawsuit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory property tax restrictions in Alabama’s Constitution. See Complaint\n\nat ¶ 6. See also Appellants’ Br. at 3 (“[P]laintiff K-12 students were acting on the\n\ninvitation of the district court and this Court in Knight v.

The Alabama Legislature (and the\n\npeople of Alabama) may choose to raise millage rates absent the caps, just as they\n\nmay choose to maintain the status quo or lower the rates, and we can only guess as\n\nto whether removal of the current millage caps will redress the plaintiffs’ injury.\n\nSee Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (“[I]t must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely\n\n‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’”).

See D.E. 242-1 at ¶ 38 (d), (f). As the district court noted,\n\n“Alabama has authorized all local school systems to levy up to an aggregate of\n\n15.0 mills in ad valorem property taxes for educational purposes, in a combination\n\nof county and school tax district taxes.” D.E. 296 at 160. Yet Lawrence and\n\n\n                                         11\n\f             Case: 11-15464      Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 12 of 29\n\n\nSumter Counties are both below the maximum permissible rate. Lawrence County\n\nlevies property taxes at 10 mills, and Sumter County levies them at 13.8 mills. See\n\nid. at 167. Given that neither municipality has levied the maximum generally\n\nauthorized taxes for education, we conclude that an injunction prohibiting\n\nenforcement of the millage caps will not likely redress the plaintiffs’ injury.\n\n      We note, as well, the acknowledgment of plaintiffs’ counsel at oral argument\n\nthat removal of the constitutional millage caps “may or may not” result in higher\n\nmillage rates.    This uncertainty reinforces our conclusion that granting the\n\nplaintiffs the relief they request would result in nothing more than a mere “moral”\n\nvictory, something the federal courts may not properly provide. See Steel Co., 523\n\nU.S. at 107 (“[A]lthough a suitor may derive great comfort and joy from the fact\n\nthat . . . a wrongdoer gets his just deserts, or that the Nation’s laws are faithfully\n\nenforced, that psychic satisfaction is not an acceptable Article III remedy because\n\nit does not redress a cognizable Article III injury.”).\n\n      The plaintiffs attempted to overcome the redressability conundrum at oral\n\nargument by labeling their requested relief more simply as the elimination of\n\nhistorical barriers, rather than an affirmative attempt to increase millage rates.\n\nThis characterization, however, is ultimately unavailing. Under current standing\n\ndoctrine, we must consider the requested relief in the context of the injury that it\n\npurports to redress.

That the barriers were allegedly\n\nput in place for a discriminatory purpose is not sufficient, in and of itself, to confer\n\nstanding.

Under these provisions, certain classes of\n\nproperty are assessed only at a percentage of their total value. Class III property,\n\nwhich includes agricultural, forest, and single-family residential property, is taxed\n\nat the lowest possible rate: 10% of its value. Class III property owners also may\n\nhave their property assessed at “current use” value rather than fair market value.\n\nAs amended, therefore, Section 217 “severely limit[s] the value of property subject\n\nto the millage rates.” Susan Pace Hamill, Constitutional Reform in Alabama: A\n\nNecessary Step Towards Achieving a Fair and Efficient Tax Structure, 33 CUMB.\n\nL.

And because property is assessed at only a\n\npercentage of its actual value, “very little of the property’s true fair market value\n\n[is] subject to taxation.” Id. at 443.\n\n      As the district court noted, it was “undisputed that the immediate effect of\n\ngranting the declaratory judgment and injunction plaintiffs seek [with respect to\n\nSection 217] w[ould] be to increase property taxes in the State of Alabama.” D.E.\n\n35 at 31 (footnote omitted). See also D.E. 296 at 112.

Id. at 111, 113.4\n\nWe therefore conclude that removing the assessment ratios would likely redress (at\n\nleast in part) the plaintiffs’ injury, and that is enough for standing purposes.

The latter category of claims, the Court held, does not\n\nimplicate the Tax Injunction Act because such claims do not “seek to impede [a\n\nstate’s] receipt of tax revenues.” Id. at 93. As the Court explained, the Act was\n\nnot intended to “insulate state tax laws from constitutional challenge in lower\n\nfederal courts even when the suit would have no negative impact on tax\n\n\n                                           16\n\f              Case: 11-15464    Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 17 of 29\n\n\ncollection.” Id. at 94.\n\n      As we read it, Hibbs at the very least stands for the proposition that third-\n\nparty challenges to the validity of state taxing schemes fall outside the ambit of the\n\nTax Injunction Act if the challenges, were they to prove successful, would result in\n\nthe increase of the tax liabilities of others (and therefore an increase in tax\n\nrevenues to the state).

The district court concluded, based on Hibbs, that the Tax\n\nInjunction Act did not divest it of jurisdiction because “[t]he undisputed, direct\n\neffect of the requested injunction would be to increase property tax revenue.” D.E.\n\n296 at 113.     In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied in part on\n\n\n                                         17\n\f               Case: 11-15464        Date Filed: 01/10/2014        Page: 18 of 29\n\n\nAlabama’s own concession that the requested injunction would lead to significant\n\nincreases in property taxes, potentially as high as 1,000%. See D.E. 296 at 113 &\n\nn. 238.5\n\n       On appeal, the State has changed its jurisdictional tune, and now argues that\n\n“prohibiting enforcement of [its] property-valuation scheme (Amendments 325 and\n\n373 and their implementing statutes and regulations) could take a . . . detrimental\n\ntoll on public revenue collections” because “tax officials in all jurisdictions may\n\nwell be powerless to issue property valuations,” and “without valid property\n\nvaluations, they would be powerless to collect any property tax at all.” Appellees’\n\nBr. at 24-25. Alabama’s newly-minted factual maybes, however, do not require\n\nreversal of the district court’s jurisdictional ruling as to the Tax Injunction Act.\n\n       As an initial matter, whether tax revenues would rise or fall if the plaintiffs\n\nsucceed on their challenges to Amendments 325 and 373 is a matter that is at least\n\npartly factual in nature, and we as an appellate tribunal are not in the business of\n\nfact-finding. Although we recognize that we have an obligation to address subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction questions even when raised for the first time on appeal,\n       5\n          The State’s concession in the district court read as follows: “If Plaintiffs are successful\nin challenging the restrictions on assessment ratios in Amendment 373 to the Alabama\nConstitution, and an injunction is issued, property in every classification would automatically be\nassessed at 100%, as opposed to the 10%, 20%, and 30% current ratios for residential,\ncommercial, and utility property, respectively. . . . By way of example, Alabama taxpayers with\na $100,000 home in a county with a property tax rate of 50 mills would see their annual property\ntax bill increase from $300 to $3,000, after taking into account the homestead exemption and the\nchange in assessment ratio.” D.E. 27 at 2 n.1. See also id. at 26 (“[I]t is certainly plausible that\ntax revenues would increase . . . .”).\n\n\n                                                 18\n\f               Case: 11-15464        Date Filed: 01/10/2014        Page: 19 of 29\n\n\nAlabama offers us no reason why we should second-guess the district court’s\n\nfindings as to jurisdictional facts. The district court and the plaintiffs alike were\n\nentitled to rely on Alabama’s factual concession that taxes would rise if the court\n\nenjoined enforcement of Amendment 373 and to believe, given that concession,\n\nthat no further evidence on the issue was needed. “Consent of parties cannot give\n\nthe courts of the United States jurisdiction, but the parties may admit the existence\n\nof facts which show jurisdiction, and the courts may act judicially upon such an\n\nadmission.” Ry.

But that concurring opinion is\n\ntoo slender a reed on which to conclusively predict what would happen under the\n\nAlabama Constitution were the assessment ratios to be invalidated.\n\n      Indeed, Alabama points to no language in the challenged Amendments and\n\nto no case law suggesting that Section 217 is the only source of the State’s power\n\nto issue valid property valuations. To the contrary, under Alabama law, “taxing\n\npower . . . has always been inherent in the State, and vested in the legislative\n\nbranch of State government,” subject only to the limitations found in the State\n\nConstitution.

Cf. Duke Power Co., 438 U.S.\n\nat 78 (“Nothing in our prior cases requires a party seeking to invoke federal\n\njurisdiction to negate . . . speculative or hypothetical possibilities.”) (discussing\n\nArticle III standing).

To the extent Levin opines on\n\nthe scope of the Tax Injunction Act at all, it does so only in dicta. See id. at 432\n\n(“Because we conclude that the comity doctrine justifies dismissal of respondents’\n\nfederal-court action, we need not decide whether the TIA would itself block the\n\nsuit.”). And that dicta, in any event, supports our holding that the Act does not bar\n\nthe plaintiffs’ challenges to Section 217. As the Supreme Court explained in\n\nLevin, “Hibbs held that the TIA d[oes] not preclude a federal challenge by a third\n\nparty who object[s] to a tax credit received by others, but in no way object[s] to her\n\nown liability under any revenue-raising tax provision.”         Id. at 430.

Relying on Levin, 560 U.S. at 429-32, it asserted that comity\n\n“bar[s] federal-court interference in ‘every case’ concerning state ‘fiscal\n\noperations’ where state courts offer an adequate forum for vindicating the ‘asserted\n\nfederal right.’” Appellees’ Br. at 27 (quoting Matthews v.

We construe these statements by counsel as a request\n\nby Alabama to abandon its comity argument on appeal. Because comity is not\n\njurisdictional in nature, see Levin, 560 U.S. at 433-34 (Thomas, J., concurring), the\n\nState is free to withdraw the comity argument, and we grant its request to do so.\n\nCf.

Even if we were inclined to reach a\n      9\n          In Weissinger, decided in 1971, a district court mandated that Alabama equalize\nproperty assessments statewide. See 330 F. Supp. at 625.\n\n\n                                              26\n\f             Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 27 of 29\n\n\ndifferent conclusion as the triers of fact, the district court did not clearly err by\n\nchoosing to credit the evidence indicating that race was not a “substantial or\n\nmotivating” factor behind the property classification system.\n\n      The Supreme Court’s decision in Hunter does not mandate a different result.\n\nThere, the Court held that the district court’s finding of no discriminatory intent in\n\nthe adoption of Section 182 of the Alabama Constitution was clearly erroneous\n\nbased on the overwhelming evidence of racial animus surrounding the\n\nConstitutional Convention of 1901. See Hunter, 471 U.S. at 225. The record not\n\nonly revealed that the Constitutional Convention was convened with the express\n\nintent of “establish[ing] white supremacy in [the] State,” but also demonstrated\n\nthat Section 182 was itself enacted with the specific intent of disenfranchising\n\nblack voters. See id. at 229, 232 (noting that “the suffrage committee selected\n\ncrimes [that would disqualify persons from registering and voting] . . . that were\n\nthought to be more commonly committed by blacks”). We by no means intend to\n\nsuggest that Hunter establishes a threshold that must be met in order to establish\n\ndiscriminatory intent; Hunter, to the contrary, was an anomalous case in that the\n\nrecord was replete with direct and overwhelming evidence of racial discrimination.\n\nAlthough Hunter does not set the floor for an evidentiary showing of\n\ndiscriminatory intent, neither does it compel a conclusion that the district court\n\nclearly erred.   Simply stated, the evidence in Hunter was quantitatively and\n\n\n                                         27\n\f                  Case: 11-15464     Date Filed: 01/10/2014       Page: 28 of 29\n\n\nqualitatively different than the evidence here. 10\n\n                                                  V\n\n          In deciding this difficult appeal, we are cognizant of Alabama’s deep and\n\ntroubled history of racial discrimination, and given the evidence at trial, we share\n\nin the district court’s concern regarding Alabama’s public education system:\n\n          Alabama continues to be plagued by an inadequately funded public\n          school system — one that hinders the upward mobility of her citizens,\n          black and white alike, especially in rural counties. . . . [As a result,]\n          [t]he children of the rural poor, whether black or white, are left to\n          struggle as best as they can in underfunded, dilapidated schools.\nD.E. 296-1 at 797-98. Courts, however, are not always able to provide relief, no\n\nmatter how noble the cause.\n\n          Here, because the requested remedy would not redress the alleged injury, the\n\nplaintiffs lack standing to challenge the constitutional millage cap provisions\n\ndespite the district court’s finding that they were enacted with discriminatory\n\nintent.        The plaintiffs’ challenges to these provisions are therefore dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice. The plaintiffs’ challenges to the State’s property classification\n\n\n          10\n           In light of our ruling, we need not address the district court’s findings with respect to\ndiscriminatory impact. As we have noted, the plaintiffs could not succeed without proving\ndiscriminatory intent, even if discriminatory impact existed. See, e.g., Arlington Heights, 429\nU.S. at 264-65 (“Official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a\nracially disproportionate impact.”). In addition, because we conclude that the district court did\nnot clearly err in its findings on the Fourteenth Amendment claims, we affirm without further\ndiscussion the district court’s rejection of the plaintiffs’ claim under Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d\net seq. See, e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (2003) (concluding that Title VI claim\n“also fail[ed]” because “the Equal Protection Clause [did] not prohibit the Law School’s\nnarrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions”).\n\n\n                                                28\n\f               Case: 11-15464   Date Filed: 01/10/2014   Page: 29 of 29\n\n\nsystem (as set forth in Amendments 325 and 373 to Section 217) are not similarly\n\nbarred, yet these claims fail because we cannot say that the district court clearly\n\nerred in finding that this system was not the product of invidious discriminatory\n\nintent.   Although the evidence presented could have supported a finding of\n\ndiscriminatory intent, sufficient evidence also rendered permissible the district\n\ncourt’s finding that these Amendments were financially, and not discriminatorily,\n\nmotivated. Under clear-error review, we are not free to second-guess the district\n\ncourt’s choice between two permissible views of the evidence. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm in part as to the claims related to Amendments 325 and 373 to Section 217,\n\nand vacate and remand in part with instructions to dismiss, without prejudice, the\n\nclaims related to Sections 214, 215, and 216 of Article XI and Section 269 of\n\nArticle XIV.\n\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO\nDISMISS IN PART.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f</pre>",
