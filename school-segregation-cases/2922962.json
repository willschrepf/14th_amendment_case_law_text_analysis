Holder\nJr., United States Attorney General.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nMILAN D. SMITH, JR., Circuit Judge:\n\n  Petitioner, Farangis Najmabadi, a native and citizen of Iran,\npetitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals’s\n(BIA or Board) order denying her motion to reopen her\n\f                      NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                    3685\nremoval proceedings on the basis of changed conditions in\nIran. Because we hold that Najmabadi failed to introduce pre-\nviously unavailable, material evidence, we deny her petition\nfor review.\n\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n   Najmabadi was admitted to the United States on October 5,\n1986, as a non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain\nin the United States until April 5, 1987. On October 27, 1998,\nthe former Immigration and Naturalization Service filed a\nnotice to appear with the immigration court charging Najma-\nbadi with removability. Najmabadi filed an asylum applica-\ntion on November 18, 1998.\n\n   On April 11, 2000, an Immigration Judge (IJ) conducted a\nremoval proceeding, at which Najmabadi claimed that she left\nIran due to its then war with Iraq. She stated that “there\nwasn’t any particular reason” that she left Iran but rather\n“[e]verything changed, especially for a woman like me.”\nAsked why she did not want to return to Iran, Najmabadi tes-\ntified that she is “not sure if [she] can live there,” and after\nsixteen years, knows the United States “now probably more\nthan [her] country.” Najmabadi further testified that she has\nnever participated in any political rallies nor joined any politi-\ncal organizations. In addition, Najmabadi never had any prob-\nlems in Iran prior to leaving. Rather, Najmabadi testified that\nshe does not think she can “fit in” in Iran and fears returning\nto Iran because of the way women are treated.\n\n   The IJ denied Najmabadi’s application. While the IJ found\nNajmabadi’s testimony to be credible, he concluded that she\nhad not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of\nfuture persecution. After the BIA affirmed, we denied the\npetition for review in an unpublished decision. Najmabadi v.\nAshcroft, 107 F. App’x 98 (9th Cir. 2004). Relying on Fisher\nv. INS, 79 F.3d 955, 962-63 (9th Cir. 1996) (en banc), we\nrejected Najmabadi’s claim that she has a well-founded fear\n\f3686                 NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nof future persecution “based on her refusal to conform to the\nsocial norms of Iran if returned to that country.” Najmabadi,\n107 F. App’x at 100.\n\n   On December 14, 2004, Najmabadi filed a petition to\nreopen based on changed circumstances in Iran. In her motion\nto reopen, Najmabadi argued that the relationship between\nIran and the United States changed significantly after Septem-\nber 11, 2001. She pointed to ties between Iran and terrorist\norganizations; Iran’s nuclear arms capabilities; tension\nbetween Iran and the United States stemming from the war in\nIraq; and “generalized strife” including an Iranian govern-\nmental backlash to Iran’s reform movement. With respect to\nthis last category, Najmabadi referred to the following: State\nDepartment reports citing the worsening of Iran’s human\nrights record from 2000 to 2003; evidence that a group of 50\nwomen were lashed for listening to loud music; election of\n“hard liners”; the denouncement of an Iranian woman who\nwon the Nobel Prize; torture of student activists as a means\nof suppressing dissent; a crackdown on the release of infor-\nmation over the Internet; the reported arrest of the editor of\na women’s rights journal; and greater restrictions on women’s\nattire and social freedoms. Najmabadi also submitted a\nrenewed asylum application and accompanying affidavit. In\nher affidavit, Najmabadi claims: the Iranian government\nwould perceive her as being “pro-U.S. and pro-Western”; she\n“do[es] not agree with how the government treats their\nwomen and people in general”; and she “will be active in try-\ning to change Iran and the situation for women.”\n\n   On March 31, 2005, the BIA denied Petitioner’s motion to\nreopen, concluding that Najmabadi did not establish changed\ncircumstances. Relying on our decision in Malty v. Ashcroft,\n381 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2004), the BIA held that while the evi-\ndence that Najmabadi submitted “establish[es] that the situa-\ntion in Iran continues to be deplorable, and that tensions with\nthe United States appear to be increasing[,]” it does not “es-\ntablish a level of change that is linked to [Najmabadi’s] par-\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                   3687\nticular circumstances.” The BIA noted that the record at the\ntime of Najmabadi’s original hearing contained the 1999\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices, which listed\n“systemic abuses . . . includ[ing] extrajudicial killings, sum-\nmary executions, disappearances, widespread use of torture\nand other degrading treatment (including rape), and arbitrary\narrest and prolonged detention.” The BIA characterized Naj-\nmabadi’s evidence as describing “general conditions which\naffect the population at large[,]” and held that this evidence\nwas “in evidence at the prior hearing.” Finally, the BIA held\nthat there was no evidence, which fell “outside the realm of\nspeculation,” that established “returnees from the United\nStates will likely face persecution.”\n\n     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   We review denials of motions to reopen for abuse of discre-\ntion, Toufighi v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir. 2008),\nand defer to the BIA’s exercise of discretion unless it acted\narbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law, Singh v. INS, 295\nF.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir. 2002). We review the BIA’s deter-\nmination of purely legal questions de novo, and review its\nfactual findings for substantial evidence. Bhasin v. Gonzales,\n423 F.3d 977, 983 (9th Cir. 2005). Finally, “[o]ur review is\nlimited to the actual grounds relied upon by the BIA.”\nRamirez-Altamirano v. Holder, 563 F.3d 800, 804 (9th Cir.\n2009).\n\n                        DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Standards Governing Motions to Reopen\n\n   [1] Generally, a party wishing to file a motion to reopen\nmust do so within ninety-days. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). How-\never, the ninety-day time limit does not apply where the\nmotion to reopen is “based on changed circumstances arising\nin the country of nationality or in the country to which depor-\ntation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was\n\f3688                  NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nnot available and could not have been discovered or presented\nat the previous hearing.” Id. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The BIA can\ndeny a motion to reopen on any one of “at least” three inde-\npendent grounds—“failure to establish a prima facie case for\nthe relief sought, failure to introduce previously unavailable,\nmaterial evidence, and a determination that even if these\nrequirements were satisfied, the movant would not be entitled\nto the discretionary grant of relief which he sought.” INS v.\nDoherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992). The Supreme Court has\ninstructed that “[t]he granting of a motion to reopen is . . . dis-\ncretionary, and the Attorney General has ‘broad discretion’ to\ngrant or deny such motions.” Id. (internal citations omitted).\n\nB.     Denial Based On Previously Unavailable, Material\n       Evidence\n\n   [2] The BIA considered Najmabadi’s motion to be “prem-\nised on the fact that circumstances in Iran have significantly\ndeclined since her hearing, and as a result she has a viable\nclaim of persecution based on direct and imputed political\nopinion, and the fact that she is a ‘westernized woman.’ ” The\nBIA held that the evidence submitted by Najmabadi in her\nmotion to reopen, which established the existence of torture\nand punishment for dissenters, was in evidence at the prior\nhearing. It explained that the evidence addressed general con-\nditions affecting the population at large, and was not linked\nto Najmabadi’s “particular circumstances.” It also noted that\nthere was no evidence, which fell “outside the realm of specu-\nlation,” that established that “returnees from the United States\nwill likely face persecution.” Thus, the BIA based its denial\nof Najmabadi’s motion to reopen on the second ground articu-\nlated above—Najmabadi’s failure to introduce previously\nunavailable, material evidence. As we must, we limit our\nreview to these grounds. See Ramirez-Altamirano, 563 F.3d at\n804.\n\n  1.    Qualitatively Different Evidence\n\n   [3] In Malty v. Ashcroft, we held that in order for evidence\nto be “material,” “not available,” and not able to have “been\n\f                      NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                    3689\ndiscovered or presented at the previous hearing,” it must be\n“qualitatively different” from the evidence presented at the\nprevious hearing. 381 F.3d at 945-46; see also 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.2(c)(1) (“A motion to reopen proceedings shall state\nthe new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the\nmotion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other\nevidentiary material.” (emphasis added)). Relying primarily\non Malty, Najmabadi argues that the Board abused its discre-\ntion in finding that her evidence was not materially distinct\nfrom the evidence at her original hearing, because her “new”\nevidence is qualitatively different. We therefore describe\nMalty in some detail.\n\n   In Malty, an Egyptian Coptic Christian filed an application\nfor asylum and withholding of removal in 1992. 381 F.3d at\n944. At the asylum hearing, he testified that he had been\ntaunted while in high school by Islamic teachers and class-\nmates due to his Christianity. Id. He was forced to finish col-\nlege from home, and was unable to find employment as a\nresult of religious discrimination. Id. He also testified that “he\nand his family received menacing telephone calls from\nIslamic militants.” Id.\n\n   After the immigration judge denied his petition and the\nBIA affirmed, we denied his petition for review. Id. Malty\nthen filed a motion to reopen based on changed circumstances\nin Egypt. Id. Along with his motion to reopen, Malty submit-\nted evidence “detailing rising levels of violence against Egyp-\ntian Coptic Christians generally and specific acts of violence\nagainst his family in particular.” Id. (emphasis added). Those\nacts included “a series of brutal attacks” against members of\nMalty’s family, including his father, all occurring after\nMalty’s original asylum hearing. Id. In addition, Malty’s\nfather had been subsequently “warned of consequences Malty\nwould face if he returned.” Id.\n\n  We held that Malty’s evidence accompanying his motion to\nreopen was “ ‘material and was not available and could not\n\f3690                       NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nhave been discovered at the previous hearing.’ ” Id. at 945\n(quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)). We faulted the BIA for\nnot recognizing that the evidence presented along with his\nmotion to reopen was “qualitatively different” from his previ-\nous evidence, and for narrowly focusing on the fact that the\nnew evidence was simply related to the petitioner’s initial\nclaim. Id. We explained that the evidence Malty had pres-\nented at his asylum hearing did little more than describe inci-\ndents of harassment and discrimination. Id. However, Malty’s\nnew evidence showed that the “harassment had increased to\nthe level of persecution, both with respect to Coptic Christians\ngenerally and with respect to Malty’s family specifically.” Id.\nat 946 (emphasis added).1\n\n  Malty’s “new” evidence consisted first of a 1999 “Freedom\nHouse Report,” which described “mass arrests and torture . . .\nof Egyptian Coptic Christians, murders of numerous Coptic\n  1\n    In arguing that Najmabadi has shown changed circumstances, the dis-\nsent simply recites Malty’s observation that “a ‘petitioner’s evidence\nregarding changed circumstances will almost always relate to his [or her]\ninitial claim.’ ” Dissent at 3702 (quoting Malty, 381 F.3d at 945). Indeed,\nthat observation is obvious. A motion to reopen asks the Board to reopen\na case in which it has previously rendered a decision. In requesting that\nthe Board reopen the case, the petitioner will often seek relief on the same\ngrounds alleged in the original petition. Yet the dissent ignores that while\nthe “new” evidence a petitioner includes in the motion to reopen necessar-\nily relates to the initial claim, its relation to the initial claim is not suffi-\ncient to amount to “material” evidence. For example in Malty, the BIA had\ndescribed the evidence presented along with the motion to reopen as\nmerely “a continuance of the circumstances that gave rise to [the petition-\ner’s] first claim.” Malty, 381 F.3d at 945 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). We explained that the BIA had incorrectly framed the issue since\n“[t]he critical question is not whether the allegations bear some connection\nto a prior application, but rather whether circumstances have changed suf-\nficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim\nfor asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.” Id.\n(emphasis added). In order to determine whether the petitioner demon-\nstrated a sufficient change in circumstances, we assessed the materiality of\nMalty’s new evidence and held it to be “qualitatively different from the\nevidence presented at his asylum hearing.” Id.\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                    3691\nChristians on account of religion, and the arrest of the\nSecretary-General of the Egyptian Organization for Human\nRights[.]” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). It also\ndescribed the growth of jiyza, a tax Christians were forced to\npay to avoid violent attacks. Id. Malty also submitted a\ndetailed declaration describing separate incidents of persecu-\ntion of his family members in Egypt. Id. For example, that\ndeclaration described that Malty’s brother had been arrested,\ninterrogated, beaten, burnt with cigarettes and subjected to\nelectrical shocks by interrogating officers. Id. Malty’s father\nhad also been attacked by Islamic militants, who destroyed his\nbusiness. Id. Malty’s brother was later beaten, at which time\nhis attackers told him that “they were going to kill all infidels\nlike him.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The police\nrefused to investigate each of these attacks. Id. Malty’s father\nwas threatened by people aware of Malty’s asylum applica-\ntion and told that if Malty returned to Egypt he would be\narrested and prosecuted. Id. On the Coptic Christmas Eve,\nMalty’s family’s apartment was ransacked, and later his father\nagain attacked, this time for failing to pay jizya. Id.\n\n   We had little trouble concluding that evidence of “menac-\ning telephone calls” and high school “taunts” is “qualitatively\ndifferent” from that of “mass arrests and torture” and the\nkinds of horrific events described in Malty’s declaration. Naj-\nmabadi’s petition does not persuade us to reach the same con-\nclusion.\n\n   At her asylum hearing, Najmabadi submitted the 1999\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices on Iran (the 1999\nReport). The 1999 Report described Iran’s human rights\nrecord as “poor,” and detailed “serious problems” in Iran’s\nhuman rights policies. For example, it included the following\ninformation about life in Iran:\n\n    Paramilitary volunteer forces known as Basijis, and\n    gangs of thugs, known as the Ansar-e Hezbollah\n    (Helpers of the Party of God), who often are aligned\n\f3692                NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\n    with specific members of the leadership, act as vigi-\n    lantes, and are released into the streets to intimidate\n    and threaten physically demonstrators, journalists,\n    and individuals suspected of counter-revolutionary\n    activities. Both regular and paramilitary security\n    forces committed numerous, serious human rights\n    abuses.\n\n       ...\n\n    The Government restricts citizens’ right to change\n    their government. Systematic abuses include extraju-\n    dicial killings and summary executions; disappear-\n    ances; widespread use of torture and other degrading\n    treatment, reportedly including rape; harsh prison\n    conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention, and pro-\n    longed and incommunicado detention. Perpetrators\n    often commit such abuses with impunity.\n\n       ...\n\n    Violence against women occurs, and women face\n    legal and societal discrimination. . . . Vigilante\n    groups, with strong ties to certain members of the\n    Government, enforce their interpretation of appropri-\n    ate social behavior through intimidation and vio-\n    lence.\n\n       ...\n\n    The State enforces gender segregation in most public\n    spaces, and prohibits women mixing openly with\n    unmarried men or men not related to them. Women\n    must ride in a reserved section on public buses and\n    enter public building, universities, and airports\n    through separate entrances. . . . Women are subject\n    to harassment by the authorities if their dress or\n    behavior is considered inappropriate, and may be\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                       3693\n    sentenced to flogging or imprisonment for such vio-\n    lations.\n\n   The 1999 Report also described the Iranian government’s\nbacklash to “reform,” noting that the “Government closed\nnumerous reform-oriented publications during the year and\nbrought charges against prominent political figures and mem-\nbers of the clergy for expressing ideas viewed as contrary to\nthe ruling orthodoxy.” The record at Najmabadi’s asylum\nhearing also included the 1997 United States Department of\nState’s “Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions”\nissued on Iran (the 1997 Profile). The 1997 Profile stated that,\n\n    the Islamic regime’s human rights record continues\n    to be abysmal, with continued reports of extrajudi-\n    cial killings and summary executions; widespread\n    use of torture and other degrading treatment; disap-\n    pearances; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of fair\n    trials; harsh prison conditions; and repression of the\n    freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association and\n    religion. . . . Women are victims of domestic vio-\n    lence as well as legal and social discrimination . . . .\n\n   With respect to women in particular, the 1997 Profile noted\nthat “[s]ome women who do not conform to [Iran’s] dress\ncode have been subject to arrest and flogging. . . . Depending\non the individual woman’s experiences and her personal cir-\ncumstances, life in today’s Iran can be unbearable under such\nconditions.”\n\n   [4] Najmabadi argues that the evidence she submits along\nwith her motion to reopen is “qualitatively different” from\nthat submitted at her initial asylum hearing. Specifically, Naj-\nmabadi points to the 2003 Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices (the 2003 Report). However, the 2003 Report\nmerely describes conditions similar to those found in the 1999\nReport. Though the 2003 Report states, “[t]he Government’s\npoor human rights record worsened,” it goes on to describe,\n\f3694                  NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nin almost carbon copy form, the examples contained in the\n1999 Report, i.e., “summary executions,” “disappearances,”\n“torture and other degrading treatment,” and “flogging.” This\nis significantly different from the situation in Malty, where we\njuxtaposed harassing telephone calls with torture, beatings,\nand death threats. The bulk of Najmabadi’s remaining evi-\ndence, though voluminous, is similarly redundant.\n\n   [5] Moreover, as the BIA concluded, the evidence Najma-\nbadi presents in her motion to reopen does not share the same\ntype of individualized relevancy we required in Malty. There,\nin addition to presenting evidence of a change in country con-\nditions indicating that harassment of Coptic Christians had\nescalated to persecution, Malty presented evidence detailing\nsix separate incidents of persecution of his family members,\nincluding the threat that Malty would be arrested and prose-\ncuted if he returned to Egypt. Malty, 381 F.3d at 944.\n\n   Likewise, in Bhasin v. Gonzales, we also required previ-\nously unavailable evidence to be material to the petitioner’s\nclaim. There, while the IJ had found the petitioner to have\nestablished a well-founded fear of future persecution, it\ndenied asylum eligibility because the persecution was not “on\naccount of” the petitioner’s imputed political opinion or mem-\nbership in a particular social group, that group being her fam-\nily. Bhasin, 423 F.3d at 982. The BIA affirmed, finding that\n“other close members of the [petitioner’s] family are living in\nIndia without difficulty. The [Islamic militant group] has not\npersecuted the respondent’s brother, two daughters, or one\ndaughter-in-law, the wife or her missing eldest son.” Id. In\ngranting the petition for review, we held that “later-\ndiscovered evidence presented in the motion to reopen rebuts\nthis critical finding.” Id. We explained that the petitioner pres-\nented new, previously unavailable evidence that her two\ndaughters and son-in-law had received death threats, violent\nverbal threats, and had subsequently disappeared while the\nappeal before the Board was pending. Id. at 983.\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                    3695\n   [6] The evidence Najmabadi points to lacks the materiality\nwe required in Malty and Bhasin. Rather, it simply recounts\ngeneralized conditions in Iran that fail to demonstrate “that\nher predicament is appreciably different from the dangers\nfaced by her fellow citizens.” Singh v. INS, 134 F.3d 962, 967\n(9th Cir. 1998) (alterations and internal quotation marks omit-\nted).\n\n   [7] Najmabadi points to the affidavit accompanying her\nmotion to reopen as evidence of her change in particular cir-\ncumstances. There, she asserts that she “will be active in try-\ning to change Iran and the situation for women[,]” and that\nshe “want[s] to make sure Iranian women get to wear [the\nclothes she designs] one day.” The Board is required to accept\nas true the facts stated in Najmabadi’s affidavit unless they\nare inherently unbelievable. Limsico v. INS, 951 F.2d 210,\n213 (9th Cir. 1991). However, there is no indication that the\nBoard failed to credit Najmabadi’s affidavit, as it character-\nized her motion as premised on her “direct and imputed politi-\ncal opinion, and the fact that she is a ‘westernized woman’ ”\nand specifically referenced both Iran’s “limitations on the\nfreedoms of women” and its punishment of dissenters. See\nalso Maroufi v. INS, 772 F.2d 597, 600 (9th Cir. 1985) (find-\ning no indication in the record that the BIA did not accept the\ntruth of an affidavit’s factual allegations accompanying a\nmotion to reopen). Rather, the Board concluded that Najma-\nbadi’s evidence details conditions affecting the population at\nlarge. There is substantial evidence in the record to support\nsuch a finding.\n\n   Moreover, “[t]he [BIA] does not have to write an exegesis\non every contention. What is required is merely that it con-\nsider the issues raised, and announce its decision in terms suf-\nficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard\nand thought and not merely reacted.” Lopez v. Ashcroft, 366\nF.3d 799, 807 n.6 (9th Cir. 2004) (alterations in original)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); accord Wang v. BIA, 437\nF.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[W]e do not hold, and in fact\n\f3696                  NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nreject any implication . . . that where the BIA has given rea-\nsoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate find-\nings, it must expressly parse or refute on the record each\nindividual argument or piece of evidence offered by the peti-\ntioner.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, the Board\nadequately considered Najmabadi’s evidence and sufficiently\nannounced its decision. It noted that “limitations on the free-\ndoms of women have been an unfortunate cornerstone in post-\nrevolution Iran[,]” and expressed its belief that Najmabadi\nprovided nothing besides speculative evidence to suggest that\n“returnees from the United States will likely face persecu-\ntion.” Though the Board did not directly reference Najma-\nbadi’s statements concerning her intent to be politically active\nin Iran, there is nothing to suggest it did not consider that evi-\ndence in deciding that post-revolution Iran has limited such\nactivism for some time. We cannot say that the Board’s fail-\nure to give reasons detailing why the affidavit did not present\npreviously unavailable, material evidence was arbitrary, irra-\ntional, or contrary to law. Cf. Maroufi, 772 F.2d at 600 (find-\ning that it was error for the BIA to assume an affidavit must\nbe independently corroborated, but holding that such error\nwas neither dispositive nor prejudicial).\n\n   [8] We have no doubt that the BIA would reach the same\ndecision if we asked it to focus more closely on the contents\nof Najmabadi’s affidavit. Accord Wang, 437 F.3d at 275\n(declining to remand for Board to consider evidence on a\nmotion to reopen where the Board failed to discuss the evi-\ndence “in any particular detail” because to do so would be\nfutile). We are so confident for two reasons. First, we fail to\nunderstand how asserting that Najmabadi will be “active in\ntrying to change Iran and the situation for women,” or that\nNajmabadi wants to make Iranian women one day wear the\nclothes that she has designed, is evidence that “was not avail-\nable and could not have been discovered or presented at the\nprevious hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Second, though\nrelated, we have recognized the perverse incentive that would\nresult from granting an applicant reopening based on a “self-\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                   3697\ninduced” change in personal circumstance; here, Najmabadi’s\ndesire to become politically active, following her previous\ntestimony to the contrary. See He v. Gonzales, 501 F.3d 1128,\n1132 (9th Cir. 2007); Larngar v. Holder, 562 F.3d 71, 76-77\n(1st Cir. 2009) (collecting cases holding that a change in per-\nsonal circumstances should not qualify as a change in country\ncircumstances). That is because a motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) must be “based on changed circumstances\narising in the country of nationality or in the country to which\ndeportation has been ordered.” (emphasis added). Accord-\ningly, substantial evidence supports the Board’s finding that\nthe evidence Najmabadi submitted in her motion to reopen\nwas not qualitatively different from the evidence presented at\nthe original hearing.\n\n  2.   Returnees From The United States To Iran\n\n   [9] The Board also held that there was no evidence estab-\nlishing that returnees from the United States will likely face\npersecution. We have previously rejected an asylum claim\nbased on the hatred of Iranians for Americans, noting that\n“this type of claim cannot possibly justify asylum[,]” because\nit would mean that “every citizen of a country unfriendly to\nthe United States would be entitled to asylum.” Kaveh-\nHaghigy v. INS, 783 F.2d 1321, 1323 (9th Cir. 1986) (per\ncuriam).\n\n  3.   Disfavored Group\n\n   Finally, Najmabadi also argues that she has a well-founded\nfear of future persecution based on her membership in a disfa-\nvored group. According to Najmabadi, that group consists of\n“westernized” women forcibly removed from the United\nStates to Iran. Establishing a well-founded fear of future per-\nsecution is one aspect of a petitioner’s prima facie case for\nrelief. See Bhasin, 423 F.3d at 984. Because the Board denied\nNajmabadi’s motion to reopen based on her failure to intro-\nduce previously unavailable, material evidence, it did not\n\f3698                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nneed to reach the question of whether Najmabadi established\na prima facie case for relief.2 See Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323.\nThus, since our review is limited to the grounds actually\nrelied upon by the BIA, Ramirez-Altamirano, 563 F.3d at 804,\nwe decline to address Najmabadi’s “westernized” group claim.3\n\n   [10] However, we note that Najmabadi’s failure to provide\nevidence linked to her particular circumstances is similarly\napplicable in this context. See Wakkary v. Holder, 558 F.3d\n1049, 1066 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[A] ‘general, undifferentiated\nclaim’ based solely on the threat to the group as a whole is not\nsufficient for an individual petitioner to establish the requisite\nlikelihood of persecution under the ‘singled out individually’\n  2\n     Similarly, in her motion to reopen, Najmabadi also sought asylum\nunder the humanitarian exception. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A), (B).\nHowever, because Najmabadi did not present previously unavailable,\nmaterial evidence, the Board was entitled to deny the motion solely on\nthose grounds. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988) (explaining\nthat there are “at least three independent grounds on which the BIA may\ndeny a motion to reopen,” the second of which is the failure to introduce\n“previously unavailable, material evidence” (emphasis added)); Toufighi,\n538 F.3d at 996. The Board was not required to give an additional basis\nfor denying the motion. Indeed, Najmabadi’s failure to provide previously\nunavailable, material evidence means that her motion is untimely. 8 C.F.R.\n§§ 1003.2(c)(1)-(3). In addition, we note that 8 C.F.R.\n§§ 1208.13(b)(1)(A), (B) provides for discretionary grants of asylum to\nvictims of past persecution, from which Najmabadi has never claimed to\nsuffer. See Belishta v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 1078, 1080 (9th Cir. 2004) (not-\ning that the humanitarian asylum exception “provides for discretionary\ngrants of asylum to victims of past persecution who no longer reasonably\nfear future persecution on account of a protected ground”); Mohammed v.\nGonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 801 (9th Cir. 2005) (same).\n   3\n     Ignoring this requirement, the dissent argues that Najmabadi has now\ndemonstrated a prima facie case for relief “based on her Western appear-\nance and affiliation.” Dissent at 3701. While “[w]e have never recognized\npro-Western as a social group protected against persecution,” Toufighi,\n538 F.3d at 997, we are nevertheless not permitted to address the issue in\nthis case, since our review is limited to those grounds relied upon by the\nBIA, and the BIA was entitled to deny Najmabadi’s motion to reopen\nbased solely on her inability to produce previously unavailable, material\nevidence. See Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323.\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                  3699\nrubric.” (quoting Lolong v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 1173, 1179\n(9th Cir. 2007) (en banc)). That is, even assuming that Najma-\nbadi is a member of a disfavored group, she points to no evi-\ndence of an individualized threat to persecute her. See, e.g.,\nMelkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061, 1069 (9th Cir. 2003)\n(individualized threat found where petitioner’s home had been\nbroken into, his property destroyed, a woman was murdered\ncaring for petitioner’s cattle, and a man was murdered\nbecause they mistook him for the petitioner’s father-in-law);\nSael v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 922, 927-28 (9th Cir. 2004) (same\nwhere petitioner testified about past threats to her safety\nincluding that her car was vandalized, the boarding house she\nwas living in was stoned, and an angry mob rushed a taxi in\nwhich she was riding and attempted to open the door); Har-\ntooni v. INS, 21 F.3d 336, 341-42 (9th Cir. 1994) (“personal\nconnection to the general persecution” found where soldiers\nstoned the petitioner’s church while she was inside,\napproached the petitioner and a group of girls who did not\nhave their hair properly bound, and visited the petitioner’s\nhome to inquire about relatives who fled to the United States);\nKotasz v. INS, 31 F.3d 847, 854-55 (9th Cir. 1994) (denying\nasylum to petitioner who did not “specify any personal expe-\nriences pertaining to individual targeting for persecution” but\ngranting as to petitioner who had been arrested at political\ndemonstrations and was an active opponent of the Communist\nregime).\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n\n  [11] For the reasons described, we hold that the Board did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Najmabadi’s motion to\nreopen.\n\n  PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.\n\f3700                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nPREGERSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   Farangis Najmabadi is a sixty-year-old native and citizen of\nIran. She has lived in the United States since April 5, 1987.\nIn those twenty-three years, she studied fashion design, estab-\nlished a dress-making business, and now designs Western\nstyle clothing for Iranian women.\n\n   In March 1998, the former INS initiated removal proceed-\nings against Najmabadi for overstaying her tourist visa. Naj-\nmabadi appeared before an IJ without counsel. She applied for\nasylum, withholding, and relief under the Convention Against\nTorture. On April 11, 2000, the IJ denied Najmabadi’s asylum\nclaim. The IJ found Najmabadi credible, but concluded that\nshe lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution based on\nthe record at that time.\n\n  On July 20, 2001, Najmabadi appealed the IJ’s denial to the\nBIA, this time with the assistance of counsel. On February 25,\n2003, the BIA affirmed the IJ’s decision without opinion. On\nAugust 18, 2004, this Court denied Najmabadi’s petition for\nreview. Najmabadi v. Ashcroft, 107 F. App’x 98 (9th Cir.\n2004).\n\n   On December 14, 2004, Najmabadi filed a motion to\nreopen with the BIA based on the changed circumstances in\nIran following September 11, 2001. On March 31, 2005, the\nBIA denied Najmabadi’s motion to reopen. The majority\ndenies Najmabadi’s petition for review of the BIA’s denial of\nher motion to reopen. I would grant that petition.\n\n  Some of the evidence Najmabadi submitted shows a rea-\nsonable likelihood1 that Najmabadi has satisfied the require-\n  1\n    This court has held that a motion to reopen must be supported with\nnew evidence, but “need only establish a prima facie case for relief, and\nneed not conclusively establish that [the petitioner] warrants relief.”\nOrdonez v. INS, 345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir. 2003). A “respondent demon-\nstrates prima facie eligibility for relief where the evidence reveals a rea-\nsonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been\nsatisfied.” Id. (citing In re S-V-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1306 (BIA 2000))\n(emphasis added).\n\f                         NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                          3701\nment of a one in ten chance of persecution2 based on her\nWestern appearance and affiliation. For example, the record\nreflects that in 2003, two long-term Iranian U.K. residents\nwere forcibly returned to Iran. Amnesty International reported\nthat the two Iranians may have faced torture and been held in\ndetention. Additionally, the record contains a May 2004 U.S.\nState Department travel warning which states that U.S. citi-\nzens may be at risk of “harassment or kidnapping” in Iran.\nFurther, the warning said “U.S. citizens of Iranian origin who\nare considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens have been\ndetained and harassed by Iranian authorities.”\n\n   Although Najmabadi is not a U.S. citizen, she has lived in\nthe U.S. for the last twenty three years and has the appearance\nand mannerisms of an Iranian-U.S. citizen. Najmabadi herself\nsaid that she “looks and acts like a Westerner derived from\ntwenty years of living in the United States.” Najmabadi’s affi-\ndavit asserts that the Iranian government punishes Iranians\nsent back sent back to Iran from the U.S. with “torture, flog-\nging, executions, beheadings and lashes.” As the majority\nnotes, under Limisco v. INS, 951 F.2d 210, 213 (9th Cir.\n1991), the BIA is required to accept these facts, stated in Naj-\nmabadi’s motion to reopen, as true unless they are inherently\nunbelievable. Najmabadi’s assertions that the Iranian govern-\nment mistreats Iranians sent back from the U.S. are not inher-\nently unbelievable. Iran’s human rights violations are widely\nknown and supported by the record. Therefore, Najmabadi’s\nassertions should be accepted as true.3\n  2\n     It is well-established that asylum may be granted where an applicant\ndemonstrates a one in ten chance of persecution. See Al-Harbi v. INS, 242\nF.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir. 2001). Thus, Najmabadi’s motion to reopen need\nonly establish that there is a reasonable likelihood that she faces at least\na one in ten chance of persecution.\n   3\n     It is also worth noting that in his original decision denying Najma-\nbadi’s claims for relief, the IJ found “no reason to doubt [Najmabadi’s]\ntruthfulness and veracity.”\n\f3702                 NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\n   The State Department Human Rights Country Reports for\nIran from 1999 to 2004 uniformly state that “citizens return-\ning from abroad sometimes were subjected to searches and\nextensive questioning by government authorities for evidence\nof anti-government activities abroad.” The reports also uni-\nformly state that “authorities sometimes harassed women if\ntheir dress or behavior was considered inappropriate and\nwomen may be sentenced to flogging or imprisonment for\nsuch violations.”\n\n   Although the Country Reports remained consistent from\n1999 to 2004, before and after Najmabadi’s immigration court\nmerits hearing, it is difficult to understand how anyone could\nthink that conditions in Iran for those associated with the\nWest have not dramatically changed for the worse following\nSeptember 11, 2001. Indeed, the case cited by both parties\nand the majority opinion on the standard for a motion to\nreopen based on changed country conditions, Malty v. Ash-\ncroft, recognized that a “petitioner’s evidence regarding\nchanged circumstances will almost always be related to his\n[or her] initial claim; nothing in the statute or regulations\nrequires otherwise.” 381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n   The BIA’s conclusion that there is no evidence supporting\nthe likelihood of persecution of returnees from the U.S. “out-\nside the realm of speculation” is undermined by the above\ndescribed record evidence. Najmabadi submitted some new\nevidence, which was unavailable at the time of Najmabadi’s\nhearing before the IJ, including the Amnesty International\nReport and the 2004 U.S. State Department travel warning. It\nis reasonably likely that, upon reopening, Najmabadi could\nestablish that she faces a one in ten risk of being targeted and\ndetained by the Iranian government or non-government agents\nthat the government is unable or unwilling to control.\n\n  In conclusion, Najmabadi has lived in this country for\ntwenty-three years as an entrepreneur, a small business owner,\nand a law-abiding member of her community. Because I\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                  3703\nbelieve that Najmabadi should be granted the chance to\nreopen her case to provide evidence regarding the persecution\nof individuals returned from the West to Iran, including “tor-\nture, flogging, executions, beheadings, and lashes,” I respect-\nfully dissent.\n\f",

HOLDER                    3685\nremoval proceedings on the basis of changed conditions in\nIran. Because we hold that Najmabadi failed to introduce pre-\nviously unavailable, material evidence, we deny her petition\nfor review.\n\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n   Najmabadi was admitted to the United States on October 5,\n1986, as a non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain\nin the United States until April 5, 1987. On October 27, 1998,\nthe former Immigration and Naturalization Service filed a\nnotice to appear with the immigration court charging Najma-\nbadi with removability. Najmabadi filed an asylum applica-\ntion on November 18, 1998.\n\n   On April 11, 2000, an Immigration Judge (IJ) conducted a\nremoval proceeding, at which Najmabadi claimed that she left\nIran due to its then war with Iraq. She stated that “there\nwasn’t any particular reason” that she left Iran but rather\n“[e]verything changed, especially for a woman like me.”\nAsked why she did not want to return to Iran, Najmabadi tes-\ntified that she is “not sure if [she] can live there,” and after\nsixteen years, knows the United States “now probably more\nthan [her] country.” Najmabadi further testified that she has\nnever participated in any political rallies nor joined any politi-\ncal organizations. In addition, Najmabadi never had any prob-\nlems in Iran prior to leaving. Rather, Najmabadi testified that\nshe does not think she can “fit in” in Iran and fears returning\nto Iran because of the way women are treated.\n\n   The IJ denied Najmabadi’s application. While the IJ found\nNajmabadi’s testimony to be credible, he concluded that she\nhad not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of\nfuture persecution. After the BIA affirmed, we denied the\npetition for review in an unpublished decision. Najmabadi v.\nAshcroft, 107 F. App’x 98 (9th Cir. 2004). Relying on Fisher\nv.

HOLDER\nof future persecution “based on her refusal to conform to the\nsocial norms of Iran if returned to that country.” Najmabadi,\n107 F. App’x at 100.\n\n   On December 14, 2004, Najmabadi filed a petition to\nreopen based on changed circumstances in Iran. In her motion\nto reopen, Najmabadi argued that the relationship between\nIran and the United States changed significantly after Septem-\nber 11, 2001. She pointed to ties between Iran and terrorist\norganizations; Iran’s nuclear arms capabilities; tension\nbetween Iran and the United States stemming from the war in\nIraq; and “generalized strife” including an Iranian govern-\nmental backlash to Iran’s reform movement. With respect to\nthis last category, Najmabadi referred to the following: State\nDepartment reports citing the worsening of Iran’s human\nrights record from 2000 to 2003; evidence that a group of 50\nwomen were lashed for listening to loud music; election of\n“hard liners”; the denouncement of an Iranian woman who\nwon the Nobel Prize; torture of student activists as a means\nof suppressing dissent; a crackdown on the release of infor-\nmation over the Internet; the reported arrest of the editor of\na women’s rights journal; and greater restrictions on women’s\nattire and social freedoms. Najmabadi also submitted a\nrenewed asylum application and accompanying affidavit. In\nher affidavit, Najmabadi claims: the Iranian government\nwould perceive her as being “pro-U.S. and pro-Western”; she\n“do[es] not agree with how the government treats their\nwomen and people in general”; and she “will be active in try-\ning to change Iran and the situation for women.”\n\n   On March 31, 2005, the BIA denied Petitioner’s motion to\nreopen, concluding that Najmabadi did not establish changed\ncircumstances.

Ashcroft,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787569\"><a href=\"/opinion/787569/anis-shokri-salama-malty-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2004), the BIA held that while the evi-\ndence that Najmabadi submitted “establish[es] that the situa-\ntion in Iran continues to be deplorable, and that tensions with\nthe United States appear to be increasing[,]” it does not “es-\ntablish a level of change that is linked to [Najmabadi’s] par-\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                   3687\nticular circumstances.” The BIA noted that the record at the\ntime of Najmabadi’s original hearing contained the 1999\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices, which listed\n“systemic abuses . . . includ[ing] extrajudicial killings, sum-\nmary executions, disappearances, widespread use of torture\nand other degrading treatment (including rape), and arbitrary\narrest and prolonged detention.” The BIA characterized Naj-\nmabadi’s evidence as describing “general conditions which\naffect the population at large[,]” and held that this evidence\nwas “in evidence at the prior hearing.” Finally, the BIA held\nthat there was no evidence, which fell “outside the realm of\nspeculation,” that established “returnees from the United\nStates will likely face persecution.”\n\n     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   We review denials of motions to reopen for abuse of discre-\ntion, Toufighi v.

Standards Governing Motions to Reopen\n\n   [1] Generally, a party wishing to file a motion to reopen\nmust do so within ninety-days. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). How-\never, the ninety-day time limit does not apply where the\nmotion to reopen is “based on changed circumstances arising\nin the country of nationality or in the country to which depor-\ntation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was\n\f3688                  NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nnot available and could not have been discovered or presented\nat the previous hearing.” Id. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The BIA can\ndeny a motion to reopen on any one of “at least” three inde-\npendent grounds—“failure to establish a prima facie case for\nthe relief sought, failure to introduce previously unavailable,\nmaterial evidence, and a determination that even if these\nrequirements were satisfied, the movant would not be entitled\nto the discretionary grant of relief which he sought.” INS v.\nDoherty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323 (1992). The Supreme Court has\ninstructed that “[t]he granting of a motion to reopen is . . . dis-\ncretionary, and the Attorney General has ‘broad discretion’ to\ngrant or deny such motions.” Id. (internal citations omitted).\n\nB.     Denial Based On Previously Unavailable, Material\n       Evidence\n\n   [2] The BIA considered Najmabadi’s motion to be “prem-\nised on the fact that circumstances in Iran have significantly\ndeclined since her hearing, and as a result she has a viable\nclaim of persecution based on direct and imputed political\nopinion, and the fact that she is a ‘westernized woman.’ ” The\nBIA held that the evidence submitted by Najmabadi in her\nmotion to reopen, which established the existence of torture\nand punishment for dissenters, was in evidence at the prior\nhearing. It explained that the evidence addressed general con-\nditions affecting the population at large, and was not linked\nto Najmabadi’s “particular circumstances.” It also noted that\nthere was no evidence, which fell “outside the realm of specu-\nlation,” that established that “returnees from the United States\nwill likely face persecution.” Thus, the BIA based its denial\nof Najmabadi’s motion to reopen on the second ground articu-\nlated above—Najmabadi’s failure to introduce previously\nunavailable, material evidence. As we must, we limit our\nreview to these grounds. See Ramirez-Altamirano, 563 F.3d at\n804.\n\n  1.    Qualitatively Different Evidence\n\n   [3] In Malty v. Ashcroft, we held that in order for evidence\nto be “material,” “not available,” and not able to have “been\n\f                      NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                    3689\ndiscovered or presented at the previous hearing,” it must be\n“qualitatively different” from the evidence presented at the\nprevious hearing. 381 F.3d at 945-46; see also 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.2(c)(1) (“A motion to reopen proceedings shall state\nthe new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the\nmotion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other\nevidentiary material.” (emphasis added)). Relying primarily\non Malty, Najmabadi argues that the Board abused its discre-\ntion in finding that her evidence was not materially distinct\nfrom the evidence at her original hearing, because her “new”\nevidence is qualitatively different. We therefore describe\nMalty in some detail.\n\n   In Malty, an Egyptian Coptic Christian filed an application\nfor asylum and withholding of removal in 1992. 381 F.3d at\n944. At the asylum hearing, he testified that he had been\ntaunted while in high school by Islamic teachers and class-\nmates due to his Christianity. Id. He was forced to finish col-\nlege from home, and was unable to find employment as a\nresult of religious discrimination. Id. He also testified that “he\nand his family received menacing telephone calls from\nIslamic militants.” Id.\n\n   After the immigration judge denied his petition and the\nBIA affirmed, we denied his petition for review. Id. Malty\nthen filed a motion to reopen based on changed circumstances\nin Egypt. Id. Along with his motion to reopen, Malty submit-\nted evidence “detailing rising levels of violence against Egyp-\ntian Coptic Christians generally and specific acts of violence\nagainst his family in particular.” Id. (emphasis added). Those\nacts included “a series of brutal attacks” against members of\nMalty’s family, including his father, all occurring after\nMalty’s original asylum hearing. Id. In addition, Malty’s\nfather had been subsequently “warned of consequences Malty\nwould face if he returned.” Id.\n\n  We held that Malty’s evidence accompanying his motion to\nreopen was “ ‘material and was not available and could not\n\f3690                       NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nhave been discovered at the previous hearing.’ ” Id. at 945\n(quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)). We faulted the BIA for\nnot recognizing that the evidence presented along with his\nmotion to reopen was “qualitatively different” from his previ-\nous evidence, and for narrowly focusing on the fact that the\nnew evidence was simply related to the petitioner’s initial\nclaim. Id. We explained that the evidence Malty had pres-\nented at his asylum hearing did little more than describe inci-\ndents of harassment and discrimination. Id. However, Malty’s\nnew evidence showed that the “harassment had increased to\nthe level of persecution, both with respect to Coptic Christians\ngenerally and with respect to Malty’s family specifically.” Id.\nat 946 (emphasis added).1\n\n  Malty’s “new” evidence consisted first of a 1999 “Freedom\nHouse Report,” which described “mass arrests and torture . . .\nof Egyptian Coptic Christians, murders of numerous Coptic\n  1\n    In arguing that Najmabadi has shown changed circumstances, the dis-\nsent simply recites Malty’s observation that “a ‘petitioner’s evidence\nregarding changed circumstances will almost always relate to his [or her]\ninitial claim.’ ” Dissent at 3702 (quoting Malty, 381 F.3d at 945). Indeed,\nthat observation is obvious. A motion to reopen asks the Board to reopen\na case in which it has previously rendered a decision. In requesting that\nthe Board reopen the case, the petitioner will often seek relief on the same\ngrounds alleged in the original petition. Yet the dissent ignores that while\nthe “new” evidence a petitioner includes in the motion to reopen necessar-\nily relates to the initial claim, its relation to the initial claim is not suffi-\ncient to amount to “material” evidence. For example in Malty, the BIA had\ndescribed the evidence presented along with the motion to reopen as\nmerely “a continuance of the circumstances that gave rise to [the petition-\ner’s] first claim.” Malty, 381 F.3d at 945 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). We explained that the BIA had incorrectly framed the issue since\n“[t]he critical question is not whether the allegations bear some connection\nto a prior application, but rather whether circumstances have changed suf-\nficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim\nfor asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.” Id.\n(emphasis added). In order to determine whether the petitioner demon-\nstrated a sufficient change in circumstances, we assessed the materiality of\nMalty’s new evidence and held it to be “qualitatively different from the\nevidence presented at his asylum hearing.” Id.\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                    3691\nChristians on account of religion, and the arrest of the\nSecretary-General of the Egyptian Organization for Human\nRights[.]” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). It also\ndescribed the growth of jiyza, a tax Christians were forced to\npay to avoid violent attacks. Id. Malty also submitted a\ndetailed declaration describing separate incidents of persecu-\ntion of his family members in Egypt. Id. For example, that\ndeclaration described that Malty’s brother had been arrested,\ninterrogated, beaten, burnt with cigarettes and subjected to\nelectrical shocks by interrogating officers. Id. Malty’s father\nhad also been attacked by Islamic militants, who destroyed his\nbusiness. Id. Malty’s brother was later beaten, at which time\nhis attackers told him that “they were going to kill all infidels\nlike him.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The police\nrefused to investigate each of these attacks. Id. Malty’s father\nwas threatened by people aware of Malty’s asylum applica-\ntion and told that if Malty returned to Egypt he would be\narrested and prosecuted. Id. On the Coptic Christmas Eve,\nMalty’s family’s apartment was ransacked, and later his father\nagain attacked, this time for failing to pay jizya. Id.\n\n   We had little trouble concluding that evidence of “menac-\ning telephone calls” and high school “taunts” is “qualitatively\ndifferent” from that of “mass arrests and torture” and the\nkinds of horrific events described in Malty’s declaration. Naj-\nmabadi’s petition does not persuade us to reach the same con-\nclusion.\n\n   At her asylum hearing, Najmabadi submitted the 1999\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices on Iran (the 1999\nReport). The 1999 Report described Iran’s human rights\nrecord as “poor,” and detailed “serious problems” in Iran’s\nhuman rights policies. For example, it included the following\ninformation about life in Iran:\n\n    Paramilitary volunteer forces known as Basijis, and\n    gangs of thugs, known as the Ansar-e Hezbollah\n    (Helpers of the Party of God), who often are aligned\n\f3692                NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\n    with specific members of the leadership, act as vigi-\n    lantes, and are released into the streets to intimidate\n    and threaten physically demonstrators, journalists,\n    and individuals suspected of counter-revolutionary\n    activities. Both regular and paramilitary security\n    forces committed numerous, serious human rights\n    abuses.\n\n       ...\n\n    The Government restricts citizens’ right to change\n    their government. Systematic abuses include extraju-\n    dicial killings and summary executions; disappear-\n    ances; widespread use of torture and other degrading\n    treatment, reportedly including rape; harsh prison\n    conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention, and pro-\n    longed and incommunicado detention. Perpetrators\n    often commit such abuses with impunity.\n\n       ...\n\n    Violence against women occurs, and women face\n    legal and societal discrimination. . . . Vigilante\n    groups, with strong ties to certain members of the\n    Government, enforce their interpretation of appropri-\n    ate social behavior through intimidation and vio-\n    lence.\n\n       ...\n\n    The State enforces gender segregation in most public\n    spaces, and prohibits women mixing openly with\n    unmarried men or men not related to them. Women\n    must ride in a reserved section on public buses and\n    enter public building, universities, and airports\n    through separate entrances. . . . Women are subject\n    to harassment by the authorities if their dress or\n    behavior is considered inappropriate, and may be\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                       3693\n    sentenced to flogging or imprisonment for such vio-\n    lations.\n\n   The 1999 Report also described the Iranian government’s\nbacklash to “reform,” noting that the “Government closed\nnumerous reform-oriented publications during the year and\nbrought charges against prominent political figures and mem-\nbers of the clergy for expressing ideas viewed as contrary to\nthe ruling orthodoxy.” The record at Najmabadi’s asylum\nhearing also included the 1997 United States Department of\nState’s “Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions”\nissued on Iran (the 1997 Profile). The 1997 Profile stated that,\n\n    the Islamic regime’s human rights record continues\n    to be abysmal, with continued reports of extrajudi-\n    cial killings and summary executions; widespread\n    use of torture and other degrading treatment; disap-\n    pearances; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of fair\n    trials; harsh prison conditions; and repression of the\n    freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association and\n    religion. . . . Women are victims of domestic vio-\n    lence as well as legal and social discrimination . . . .\n\n   With respect to women in particular, the 1997 Profile noted\nthat “[s]ome women who do not conform to [Iran’s] dress\ncode have been subject to arrest and flogging. . . . Depending\non the individual woman’s experiences and her personal cir-\ncumstances, life in today’s Iran can be unbearable under such\nconditions.”\n\n   [4] Najmabadi argues that the evidence she submits along\nwith her motion to reopen is “qualitatively different” from\nthat submitted at her initial asylum hearing. Specifically, Naj-\nmabadi points to the 2003 Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices (the 2003 Report). However, the 2003 Report\nmerely describes conditions similar to those found in the 1999\nReport. Though the 2003 Report states, “[t]he Government’s\npoor human rights record worsened,” it goes on to describe,\n\f3694                  NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nin almost carbon copy form, the examples contained in the\n1999 Report, i.e., “summary executions,” “disappearances,”\n“torture and other degrading treatment,” and “flogging.” This\nis significantly different from the situation in Malty, where we\njuxtaposed harassing telephone calls with torture, beatings,\nand death threats. The bulk of Najmabadi’s remaining evi-\ndence, though voluminous, is similarly redundant.\n\n   [5] Moreover, as the BIA concluded, the evidence Najma-\nbadi presents in her motion to reopen does not share the same\ntype of individualized relevancy we required in Malty. There,\nin addition to presenting evidence of a change in country con-\nditions indicating that harassment of Coptic Christians had\nescalated to persecution, Malty presented evidence detailing\nsix separate incidents of persecution of his family members,\nincluding the threat that Malty would be arrested and prose-\ncuted if he returned to Egypt. Malty, 381 F.3d at 944.\n\n   Likewise, in Bhasin v. Gonzales, we also required previ-\nously unavailable evidence to be material to the petitioner’s\nclaim. There, while the IJ had found the petitioner to have\nestablished a well-founded fear of future persecution, it\ndenied asylum eligibility because the persecution was not “on\naccount of” the petitioner’s imputed political opinion or mem-\nbership in a particular social group, that group being her fam-\nily. Bhasin, 423 F.3d at 982. The BIA affirmed, finding that\n“other close members of the [petitioner’s] family are living in\nIndia without difficulty. The [Islamic militant group] has not\npersecuted the respondent’s brother, two daughters, or one\ndaughter-in-law, the wife or her missing eldest son.” Id. In\ngranting the petition for review, we held that “later-\ndiscovered evidence presented in the motion to reopen rebuts\nthis critical finding.” Id. We explained that the petitioner pres-\nented new, previously unavailable evidence that her two\ndaughters and son-in-law had received death threats, violent\nverbal threats, and had subsequently disappeared while the\nappeal before the Board was pending. Id. at 983.\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                    3695\n   [6] The evidence Najmabadi points to lacks the materiality\nwe required in Malty and Bhasin. Rather, it simply recounts\ngeneralized conditions in Iran that fail to demonstrate “that\nher predicament is appreciably different from the dangers\nfaced by her fellow citizens.” Singh v.

There, she asserts that she “will be active in try-\ning to change Iran and the situation for women[,]” and that\nshe “want[s] to make sure Iranian women get to wear [the\nclothes she designs] one day.” The Board is required to accept\nas true the facts stated in Najmabadi’s affidavit unless they\nare inherently unbelievable.

However, there is no indication that the\nBoard failed to credit Najmabadi’s affidavit, as it character-\nized her motion as premised on her “direct and imputed politi-\ncal opinion, and the fact that she is a ‘westernized woman’ ”\nand specifically referenced both Iran’s “limitations on the\nfreedoms of women” and its punishment of dissenters. See\nalso Maroufi v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457930\"><a href=\"/opinion/457930/mortaza-vaez-maroufi-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (9th Cir. 1985) (find-\ning no indication in the record that the BIA did not accept the\ntruth of an affidavit’s factual allegations accompanying a\nmotion to reopen). Rather, the Board concluded that Najma-\nbadi’s evidence details conditions affecting the population at\nlarge. There is substantial evidence in the record to support\nsuch a finding.\n\n   Moreover, “[t]he [BIA] does not have to write an exegesis\non every contention. What is required is merely that it con-\nsider the issues raised, and announce its decision in terms suf-\nficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard\nand thought and not merely reacted.” Lopez v.

Here, the Board\nadequately considered Najmabadi’s evidence and sufficiently\nannounced its decision. It noted that “limitations on the free-\ndoms of women have been an unfortunate cornerstone in post-\nrevolution Iran[,]” and expressed its belief that Najmabadi\nprovided nothing besides speculative evidence to suggest that\n“returnees from the United States will likely face persecu-\ntion.” Though the Board did not directly reference Najma-\nbadi’s statements concerning her intent to be politically active\nin Iran, there is nothing to suggest it did not consider that evi-\ndence in deciding that post-revolution Iran has limited such\nactivism for some time. We cannot say that the Board’s fail-\nure to give reasons detailing why the affidavit did not present\npreviously unavailable, material evidence was arbitrary, irra-\ntional, or contrary to law. Cf. Maroufi, 772 F.2d at 600 (find-\ning that it was error for the BIA to assume an affidavit must\nbe independently corroborated, but holding that such error\nwas neither dispositive nor prejudicial).\n\n   [8] We have no doubt that the BIA would reach the same\ndecision if we asked it to focus more closely on the contents\nof Najmabadi’s affidavit. Accord Wang, 437 F.3d at 275\n(declining to remand for Board to consider evidence on a\nmotion to reopen where the Board failed to discuss the evi-\ndence “in any particular detail” because to do so would be\nfutile). We are so confident for two reasons. First, we fail to\nunderstand how asserting that Najmabadi will be “active in\ntrying to change Iran and the situation for women,” or that\nNajmabadi wants to make Iranian women one day wear the\nclothes that she has designed, is evidence that “was not avail-\nable and could not have been discovered or presented at the\nprevious hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Second, though\nrelated, we have recognized the perverse incentive that would\nresult from granting an applicant reopening based on a “self-\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                   3697\ninduced” change in personal circumstance; here, Najmabadi’s\ndesire to become politically active, following her previous\ntestimony to the contrary. See He v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460155\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460155/he-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1132 (9th Cir. 2007); Larngar v.

That is because a motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) must be “based on changed circumstances\narising in the country of nationality or in the country to which\ndeportation has been ordered.” (emphasis added). Accord-\ningly, substantial evidence supports the Board’s finding that\nthe evidence Najmabadi submitted in her motion to reopen\nwas not qualitatively different from the evidence presented at\nthe original hearing.\n\n  2.   Returnees From The United States To Iran\n\n   [9] The Board also held that there was no evidence estab-\nlishing that returnees from the United States will likely face\npersecution. We have previously rejected an asylum claim\nbased on the hatred of Iranians for Americans, noting that\n“this type of claim cannot possibly justify asylum[,]” because\nit would mean that “every citizen of a country unfriendly to\nthe United States would be entitled to asylum.” Kaveh-\nHaghigy v.

Disfavored Group\n\n   Finally, Najmabadi also argues that she has a well-founded\nfear of future persecution based on her membership in a disfa-\nvored group. According to Najmabadi, that group consists of\n“westernized” women forcibly removed from the United\nStates to Iran. Establishing a well-founded fear of future per-\nsecution is one aspect of a petitioner’s prima facie case for\nrelief. See Bhasin, 423 F.3d at 984. Because the Board denied\nNajmabadi’s motion to reopen based on her failure to intro-\nduce previously unavailable, material evidence, it did not\n\f3698                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\nneed to reach the question of whether Najmabadi established\na prima facie case for relief.2 See Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323.\nThus, since our review is limited to the grounds actually\nrelied upon by the BIA, Ramirez-Altamirano, 563 F.3d at 804,\nwe decline to address Najmabadi’s “westernized” group claim.3\n\n   [10] However, we note that Najmabadi’s failure to provide\nevidence linked to her particular circumstances is similarly\napplicable in this context. See Wakkary v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1354339\"><a href=\"/opinion/1354339/wakkary-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1066 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[A] ‘general, undifferentiated\nclaim’ based solely on the threat to the group as a whole is not\nsufficient for an individual petitioner to establish the requisite\nlikelihood of persecution under the ‘singled out individually’\n  2\n     Similarly, in her motion to reopen, Najmabadi also sought asylum\nunder the humanitarian exception. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A), (B).\nHowever, because Najmabadi did not present previously unavailable,\nmaterial evidence, the Board was entitled to deny the motion solely on\nthose grounds.

The Board was not required to give an additional basis\nfor denying the motion. Indeed, Najmabadi’s failure to provide previously\nunavailable, material evidence means that her motion is untimely. 8 C.F.R.\n§§ 1003.2(c)(1)-(3). In addition, we note that 8 C.F.R.\n§§ 1208.13(b)(1)(A), (B) provides for discretionary grants of asylum to\nvictims of past persecution, from which Najmabadi has never claimed to\nsuffer.

HOLDER\nPREGERSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   Farangis Najmabadi is a sixty-year-old native and citizen of\nIran. She has lived in the United States since April 5, 1987.\nIn those twenty-three years, she studied fashion design, estab-\nlished a dress-making business, and now designs Western\nstyle clothing for Iranian women.\n\n   In March 1998, the former INS initiated removal proceed-\nings against Najmabadi for overstaying her tourist visa. Naj-\nmabadi appeared before an IJ without counsel. She applied for\nasylum, withholding, and relief under the Convention Against\nTorture. On April 11, 2000, the IJ denied Najmabadi’s asylum\nclaim. The IJ found Najmabadi credible, but concluded that\nshe lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution based on\nthe record at that time.\n\n  On July 20, 2001, Najmabadi appealed the IJ’s denial to the\nBIA, this time with the assistance of counsel. On February 25,\n2003, the BIA affirmed the IJ’s decision without opinion. On\nAugust 18, 2004, this Court denied Najmabadi’s petition for\nreview. Najmabadi v. Ashcroft, 107 F. App’x 98 (9th Cir.\n2004).\n\n   On December 14, 2004, Najmabadi filed a motion to\nreopen with the BIA based on the changed circumstances in\nIran following September 11, 2001. On March 31, 2005, the\nBIA denied Najmabadi’s motion to reopen. The majority\ndenies Najmabadi’s petition for review of the BIA’s denial of\nher motion to reopen. I would grant that petition.\n\n  Some of the evidence Najmabadi submitted shows a rea-\nsonable likelihood1 that Najmabadi has satisfied the require-\n  1\n    This court has held that a motion to reopen must be supported with\nnew evidence, but “need only establish a prima facie case for relief, and\nneed not conclusively establish that [the petitioner] warrants relief.”\nOrdonez v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783761\"><a href=\"/opinion/783761/carlos-humberto-ordonez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 785 (9th Cir. 2003). A “respondent demon-\nstrates prima facie eligibility for relief where the evidence reveals a rea-\nsonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been\nsatisfied.” Id. (citing In re S-V-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1306 (BIA 2000))\n(emphasis added).\n\f                         NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                          3701\nment of a one in ten chance of persecution2 based on her\nWestern appearance and affiliation. For example, the record\nreflects that in 2003, two long-term Iranian U.K. residents\nwere forcibly returned to Iran. Amnesty International reported\nthat the two Iranians may have faced torture and been held in\ndetention. Additionally, the record contains a May 2004 U.S.\nState Department travel warning which states that U.S. citi-\nzens may be at risk of “harassment or kidnapping” in Iran.\nFurther, the warning said “U.S. citizens of Iranian origin who\nare considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens have been\ndetained and harassed by Iranian authorities.”\n\n   Although Najmabadi is not a U.S. citizen, she has lived in\nthe U.S. for the last twenty three years and has the appearance\nand mannerisms of an Iranian-U.S. citizen. Najmabadi herself\nsaid that she “looks and acts like a Westerner derived from\ntwenty years of living in the United States.” Najmabadi’s affi-\ndavit asserts that the Iranian government punishes Iranians\nsent back sent back to Iran from the U.S. with “torture, flog-\nging, executions, beheadings and lashes.” As the majority\nnotes, under Limisco v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573210\"><a href=\"/opinion/573210/laurence-g-limsico-v-us-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (9th Cir.\n1991), the BIA is required to accept these facts, stated in Naj-\nmabadi’s motion to reopen, as true unless they are inherently\nunbelievable. Najmabadi’s assertions that the Iranian govern-\nment mistreats Iranians sent back from the U.S. are not inher-\nently unbelievable. Iran’s human rights violations are widely\nknown and supported by the record. Therefore, Najmabadi’s\nassertions should be accepted as true.3\n  2\n     It is well-established that asylum may be granted where an applicant\ndemonstrates a one in ten chance of persecution. See Al-Harbi v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772388\"><a href=\"/opinion/772388/naseem-salman-al-harbi-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888 (9th Cir. 2001). Thus, Najmabadi’s motion to reopen need\nonly establish that there is a reasonable likelihood that she faces at least\na one in ten chance of persecution.\n   3\n     It is also worth noting that in his original decision denying Najma-\nbadi’s claims for relief, the IJ found “no reason to doubt [Najmabadi’s]\ntruthfulness and veracity.”\n\f3702                 NAJMABADI v. HOLDER\n   The State Department Human Rights Country Reports for\nIran from 1999 to 2004 uniformly state that “citizens return-\ning from abroad sometimes were subjected to searches and\nextensive questioning by government authorities for evidence\nof anti-government activities abroad.” The reports also uni-\nformly state that “authorities sometimes harassed women if\ntheir dress or behavior was considered inappropriate and\nwomen may be sentenced to flogging or imprisonment for\nsuch violations.”\n\n   Although the Country Reports remained consistent from\n1999 to 2004, before and after Najmabadi’s immigration court\nmerits hearing, it is difficult to understand how anyone could\nthink that conditions in Iran for those associated with the\nWest have not dramatically changed for the worse following\nSeptember 11, 2001. Indeed, the case cited by both parties\nand the majority opinion on the standard for a motion to\nreopen based on changed country conditions, Malty v. Ash-\ncroft, recognized that a “petitioner’s evidence regarding\nchanged circumstances will almost always be related to his\n[or her] initial claim; nothing in the statute or regulations\nrequires otherwise.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787569\"><a href=\"/opinion/787569/anis-shokri-salama-malty-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 945 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n   The BIA’s conclusion that there is no evidence supporting\nthe likelihood of persecution of returnees from the U.S. “out-\nside the realm of speculation” is undermined by the above\ndescribed record evidence. Najmabadi submitted some new\nevidence, which was unavailable at the time of Najmabadi’s\nhearing before the IJ, including the Amnesty International\nReport and the 2004 U.S. State Department travel warning. It\nis reasonably likely that, upon reopening, Najmabadi could\nestablish that she faces a one in ten risk of being targeted and\ndetained by the Iranian government or non-government agents\nthat the government is unable or unwilling to control.\n\n  In conclusion, Najmabadi has lived in this country for\ntwenty-three years as an entrepreneur, a small business owner,\nand a law-abiding member of her community. Because I\n\f                     NAJMABADI v. HOLDER                  3703\nbelieve that Najmabadi should be granted the chance to\nreopen her case to provide evidence regarding the persecution\nof individuals returned from the West to Iran, including “tor-\nture, flogging, executions, beheadings, and lashes,” I respect-\nfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
