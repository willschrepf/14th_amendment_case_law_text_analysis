CR 4-9. After a bench trial, the\n\ntrial court awarded the plaintiff recovery of a specific piece of property, namely a\n\ntrailer, as well as attorneys’ fees. CR 74-77.\n\n                      REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      Because the case is relatively complex and has a convoluted fact pattern, oral\n\nargument may assist the court’s decisional process.\n\n                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.    What is the effect of the trial court’s refusal to file additional findings of fact\n      after a request?\n\n2.    Is there any evidence of consideration for the alleged oral contract?\n\n3.    Is the alleged oral contract insufficiently definite for enforcement?\n\n4.    Is there any evidence that the alleged contract was breached?\n\n5.    Was it proper for the trial court to award recovery of a specific piece of\n      property for a simple breach of contract?\n\n6.    Is there sufficient evidence of attorneys’ fees?\n\n7.    Did the plaintiff’s attorney properly segregate his attorneys’ fees by cause of\n      action?\n\n8.    Did the plaintiff’s attorney properly segregate his attorneys’ fees by time\n      relative to the date of presentment of his breach of contract claim?\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      According to the plaintiff, Mary Swansen, the story proceeds as follows. The\n\nnext four paragraphs are based entirely on her testimony unless otherwise noted.\n\n      Sometime in the beginning of 2007, the plaintiff bought a 20-foot mobile home\n\n(also called a park trailer because it is so small) worth $50,000 for $33,000 in 2006.\n\n1 RR 7-9 & 13; Defendant’s Exhibit 1 (attached to the end of Volume 1 of the\n\nReporter’s Record). She rented a lot for it from the Appellant, Tonda Helms, for $225\n\nper month. 1 RR 14. After about a year, the plaintiff married a man in Kansas who\n\nalready had a home, so she decided to get rid of it. 1 RR 15. Since a realtor’s office\n\ndid not want to sell it for her, she decided to sell it through Appellant, her landlord.\n\n1 RR 16. The plaintiff asked Appellant to offer it at $50,000 and then gradually\n\nreduce the asking price to $25,000. 1 RR 18.\n\n      There was no written contract between the parties. 1 RR 17. There was no\n\nobligation flowing from the plaintiff to Appellant: at the time, the plaintiff did not\n\nowe any rent, as she had paid every month. 1 RR 14. Lot rent did not continue to\n\naccumulate after she asked Appellant to sell the trailer for her, either, so no money\n\nwas owed to Appellant at all. 1 RR 18. No money was to be made by Appellant. 1 RR\n\n19.\n\n      Soon thereafter, Appellant sold the trailer to a man for monthly payments. 1 RR\n\n                                           8\n\f19. The plaintiff found out in January of 2010 and filed a suit in small claims court.\n\n1 RR 20. When the judge announced that she would not prevail, she began crying, so\n\nhe changed his decision so that she would recover the trailer. 1 RR 22. On appeal to\n\nthe County Court at Law #3 for Smith County, her case was dismissed. 1 RR 23-24.\n\nHer representative on appeal was Appellant’s former handyman, Nathan McCarty, an\n\nunlicensed individual. 2 RR 28-29 & 39-40; Exhibit 5. According to him, he cannot\n\nread but is able to copy whatever he sees. 2 RR 40-41. Her original appellate attorney\n\nhad withdrawn due and put in the motion that he had a conflict with her, but that was\n\nnot his real reason. 2 RR 17. “He preferred to say that than what he told me, that he\n\ndidn’t work with a crooked judge.” 2 RR 17 at 16-17. The plaintiff then went to\n\nanother justice of the peace to get a writ of possession. He refused to accept a check,\n\ndemanding cash, and after she put $150 in his hand, he slammed the door shut and\n\nrefused to do anything else. 1 RR 25-26.\n\n      She filed judicial complaints against all three judges that had handled the case.\n\n2 RR 20. Afterwards, she contacted the local sheriff, the constable, the Texas\n\nRangers, and the U.S. Attorney’s office but each refused to get involved. 1 RR 32-33\n\n& 35. The plaintiff ultimately filed this suit in 2013, claiming that an oral contract\n\nbetween the parties had been breached. CR 4-7. She did not file it as conversion claim\n\nbecause the statute of limitations had already run. 1 RR 31.\n\n                                           9\n\f      Appellant had a very different recollection of events. According to her, the\n\ntrailer was given to her in payment for back rent that was owed. 2 RR 44-45, 51-52\n\n& 58. Appellant buys and sells mobile homes often, particularly when back rent is\n\nowed, but ordinarily it is done through a bank mortgage. 2 RR 53-54. When the bank\n\nforecloses and sells a mobile home owned by someone that owes Appellant for rent,\n\nshe bids on it, and if she wins, then she deducts the amount owed to her from the\n\npayment she makes on the trailer. 2 RR 54. The arrangement is similar to an offset.\n\n      This sale worked somewhat differently because there was no bank involved.\n\nAppellant made efforts to sell the home, including putting ads in the Tyler Paper and\n\nthe Thrifty Nickel and placing signs in front of the park and on the home. 2 RR 103.\n\nBut the house did not sell and lot rent continued to accrue month after month while\n\nthe trailer sat on Appellant’s property. 2 RR 86 at 10-15; 2 RR 94. Since the plaintiff\n\nwas going to lose the home anyway, and her debt to Appellant was accumulating, she\n\ngave it to Appellant as full payment for money owed. 2 RR 52. 2 RR 64.\n\n      The plaintiff admitted that she declared bankruptcy in May of 2008. 1 RR 58\n\nat 8-10; Exhibit 2, Page 2. In the bankruptcy petition, she listed herself as owning no\n\nreal property and a total of $5,575 in personal property (including clothing, jewelry,\n\nbooks, and a 2006 Saturn Ion). 1 RR 64-66. She did not include the trailer she valued\n\nat $50,000 in that list. 1 RR 64-66; Exhibit 2, Page 17-19. According to her, she\n\n                                          10\n\fforgot about it. 1 RR 67 at 3-5. Her debts totaled $142,561.00. Exhibit 2 at Page 33.\n\n      The buyer for the trailer was found in September of 2009, after the trailer\n\nwould have gone to the plaintiff’s creditors in bankruptcy if she had kept it herself.\n\n2 RR 87 at 21-23. Nevertheless, the plaintiff has tried two times without legal process\n\nto remove the home from Appellant’s property. 2 RR 88.\n\n      The trial court found that a contract existed between the parties and that it had\n\nbeen breached and awarded the plaintiff recovery of the trailer home and attorneys’\n\nfees. CR 74-77.\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial court, after request, made findings of fact but refused to file additional\n\nfindings on certain key elements of the plaintiff’s breach of contract case, including\n\nwhat the consideration for the contract was, what the material terms of the contract\n\nwere, what terms were breached, and the date of presentment of the breach of contract\n\nclaim. The missing findings cannot be deemed or presumed on appeal because there\n\nwas a timely request that notified the trial court of the problem. Therefore, elements\n\nof the plaintiff’s case are absent, which results in a take-nothing judgment.\n\n      Even if there were presumed or deemed findings in favor of the judgment, there\n\nis no evidence of consideration. The plaintiff’s case rests on the notion that Appellant\n\ngratuitously agreed to sell her trailer home for her. That is not a contract because it\n\n                                           11\n\flacks consideration.\n\n      The alleged contract is also insufficiently definite to be enforced. It is entirely\n\nunclear from the record what the terms were supposed to have been. Without\n\nguidance as to the rights and obligations of each party, a contract is unenforceable.\n\n      There is no evidence of breach. In the findings and judgment, the agreement\n\nwas that Appellant would sell the plaintiff’s trailer. The trailer was sold. The findings\n\nand judgment indicate that there was a breach because Appellant put her name on the\n\ntitle to the trailer, but there was no agreement in the original terms that Appellant\n\nwould not do that.\n\n      There is also no evidence to support the award of attorneys’ fees. The\n\nplaintiff’s attorney elected to proceed under the lodestar method but he did not detail\n\nwhat he did and how long it took him. He merely stated that his time is worth $250\n\nan hour and he has accumulated $12,938.85 in bills. Dividing that out, it means that\n\nhe spent 51.7554 hours on the case, but more specificity is required in order for the\n\njudge to be able to consider the reasonableness and necessity of the activities\n\nperformed in the case.\n\n      Even if there is evidence to support the award of attorneys’ fees, they have not\n\nbeen segregated by cause of action. The plaintiff proceeded under multiple other legal\n\ntheories which were abandoned after trial. He did not segregate work performed in\n\n                                           12\n\fthose causes out from the breach of contract action.\n\n      The plaintiff’s attorney also did not segregate his fees by time relative to\n\npresentment. He stated that he made presentment after suit was filed but failed to say\n\nthe precise date, and he did not state which fees were incurred before rather than after\n\nthe presentment. Since fees incurred before the date of presentment are not\n\nrecoverable, a new trial on attorneys’ fees is required to segregate our recoverable\n\nfrom unrecoverable fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                                   ARGUMENT\n\nI.    Refusal to Make Additional Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n      A.     Introduction\n\n      After the court entered its final judgment, Appellant timely filed a Request for\n\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law under Tex. R. Civ. P. 296. CR 88-89. The\n\ntrial court did not file its findings within the twenty-day time period prescribed by\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 297, so Appellant filed and served a Notice of Past Due Findings of\n\nFact and Conclusions of Law. CR 91-92. After Appellee filed her proposed findings,\n\nthe trial court signed and adopted them. CR 102-106. These findings abandoned\n\nseveral of the plaintiff’s causes of action, including breach of trust and breach of\n\nfiduciary duty. CR 5. The only remaining cause of action was breach of contract. See\n\nCR 102-106.\n\n      The findings did not include all the essential elements of a breach of contract:\n\nthere are no findings on what the terms of the contract were, what term was breached,\n\nor what was the consideration given by each party. See CR 102-106. The only finding\n\nof fact on the existence of the contract is a conclusory statement that “the parties\n\nentered into a valid oral contractual agreement via the exchange of mutual promises\n\nunder which Defendant agreed to find a buyer for the park model home.” CR 102.\n\nSince these facts are critical to the outcome of this appeal, Appellant filed a Request\n\n                                          14\n\ffor Additional or Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. CR 97-98. The\n\nfollowing findings were requested:\n\n      1.   The consideration given by each party to the contract.\n      2.   The material terms of the contract between the parties.\n      3.   Which material term was breached, and by what specific act.\n      4.   The date the claim for breach of contract was presented to the\n      Defendant under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.002.\n\nCR 97. The trial court never filed any additional findings.\n\n      B.     Effect of Failure to File Additional or Amended Findings\n\n      The Rules clearly state the effect of a court’s refusal to make appropriate\n\nfindings: “No findings or conclusions shall be deemed or presumed by any failure of\n\nthe court to make any additional findings or conclusions.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 298. Since\n\nthe findings of fact are treated as jury verdicts on special questions, Anderson v. City\n\nof Seven Points, 806 S.W.2d 791, 794 (Tex. 1991), and it is axiomatic that all\n\nessential elements of a claim must be found in order for recovery, it would seem\n\nstraightforward that, after notice, failing to find an essential element of a claim would\n\nresult in a take-nothing judgment. The path to that simple result is complicated,\n\nthough, and it depends in large part on the efforts of the parties to preserve error.\n\n      If there is neither a reporter’s record nor findings of fact, the appellate court\n\nassumes the trial court heard sufficient evidence to make any and all the necessary\n\nfindings to support the judgment. Vickery v. Commission for Lawyer Discipline, 5\n\n                                           15\n\fS.W.3d 241, 251 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied). In other\n\nwords, the appeal is immediately lost and there is no appellate review.\n\n      If a reporter’s record is filed but no findings of fact are requested or made, it\n\nis again implied that the trial court made any and all necessary findings to support the\n\njudgment. Worford v. Stamper, 801 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. 1990). But since there is\n\na reporter’s record, the appellate court can review the sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport those implied findings. See id. The court affirms the judgment if it can be\n\nsupported by any legal theory in the evidence. Id.\n\n      If a reporter’s record is filed and findings of fact are made, the findings will be\n\nsustained if there is any evidence to support them (instead of the judgment). Lindner\n\nv. Hill, 673 S.W.2d 611, 614 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1984, aff’d Lindner v. Hill,\n\n691 S.W.2d 590 (Tex. 1985). Rather than pore over an entire record and create a set\n\nof hypothetical findings for all the determinative facts of the case, the court of appeals\n\nonly looks to the findings of fact and decides whether they are supported by the\n\nevidence. This approach narrows the issues on appeal: the factual findings are the\n\nequivalent of a jury verdict on special issues. Id.\n\n      The question remains of what to do if necessary findings are omitted. For\n\nexample, if a plaintiff sues for negligence, and the trial court makes findings that the\n\ndefendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care, the defendant caused the plaintiff’s\n\n                                           16\n\finjuries, and the injuries are compensable in the amount of $100,000, there is an\n\nomitted element of the case: the trial court did not make a finding that the defendant\n\nbreached its duty of care. D. Houston, Inc. v. Love, 92 S.W.3d 450, 454 (Tex. 2002)\n\n(stating essential elements of a negligence claim). Does the court revert to the default\n\napproach of affirming so long as the omitted findings have support in the evidence?\n\n      There are two steps to answer this question. First, the appellate court\n\ndetermines whether the omitted finding is of an entire ground of recovery or defense,\n\nno element which has been found by the trial court. Tex. R. Civ. P. 299. In that case,\n\nthe ground of recovery or defense is waived. Tex. R. Civ. P. 299 (“The judgment may\n\nnot be supported upon appeal by a presumed finding upon any ground of recovery or\n\ndefense, no element of which has been included in the findings of fact.”). If at least\n\none element of the ground of recovery or defense is included in the findings, the next\n\nquestion is whether the complaining party notified the trial court of the omitted\n\nelements. If no complaint was made (via request), the unrequested elements are\n\nsupplied by presumption. Tex. R. Civ. P. 299 (“[W]hen one or more elements thereof\n\nhave been found by the trial court, omitted unrequested elements, when supported by\n\nevidence, will be supplied by presumption in support of the judgment”). If the trial\n\ncourt is notified of the omission, the ground of recovery or defense is waived. Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 298 (“No findings or conclusions shall be deemed or presumed by any\n\n                                          17\n\ffailure of the court to make any additional findings or conclusions.”)\n\n      It works similarly to omissions from a jury charge: if the entire ground of\n\nrecovery or defense is omitted, that ground of recovery or defense is waived entirely.\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 279. If one or more elements of the ground of recovery or defense is\n\nsubmitted, but others are omitted, and no objection or request is made, then the\n\nomitted elements are supplied by implication. Tex. R. Civ. P. 279. But if an essential\n\nelement is not submitted, and the defect is brought to the court’s attention in a timely\n\nmanner by request, and the jury charge is still submitted in that defective manner, the\n\nresult is a take-nothing judgment. State Dept. Highways v. Payne, 838 S.W.2d 235,\n\n241 (Tex. 1992). The answers to the special issues do not include all the necessary\n\nelements of the claim, and without all essential elements, a claim fails. See id.\n\n      This system is designed to avoid reversal by inadvertent omission: if neither\n\nlitigant brings the problem to the court’s attention, the problem is waived. Vickery\n\nv. Commission for Lawyer Discipline, 5 S.W.3d 241, 254 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 1999, pet. denied). As with a trial objection, it is incumbent on the appealing\n\nparty to point out distinctively the issue to the trial court to give it an opportunity to\n\ncorrect the mistake. Id. The objection cannot be confounded by voluminous\n\nunfounded objections. Id. The requested findings must relate to the ultimate or\n\ncontrolling legal issues, not just issues of evidence. Texas E. Transmission Corp. v.\n\n                                           18\n\fSealy Ind. School Dist., 572 S.W.2d 49, 51 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1978, no\n\nwrit).\n\n         It is also insufficient to make a request for negative findings. Id. The trial court\n\nis under no obligation to make a finding that is contrary to findings already entered.\n\nAsai v. Vanco Insulation Abatement, Inc., 932 S.W.2d 118, 122 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n1996, no writ); Simmons v. Compania Financiera Libano, 830 S.W.2d 789, 793 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied); Eikenhorst v. Eikenhorst, 746 S.W.2d\n\n882, 887 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no writ). Logically, it would make\n\nno sense for the losing party to request the trial court to make findings of fact that\n\nconflict with its own judgment. The purpose of the rule is to require the trial court to\n\nspecify the basis for its own decision, thus narrowing the issues on appeal. That\n\npurpose is not served by requiring the submission of proposed findings that will be\n\nsummarily rejected and ignored.\n\n         The situation we are left with is one in which the trial court has made findings\n\nof fact, including one element of a ground of recovery or defense, but which omit\n\nother elements of that ground of recovery or defense, and a party has made a request\n\nfor a finding on the omitted elements. In that scenario, the omission is no longer\n\ninadvertent: it is deliberate. Vickery v. Commission for Lawyer Discipline, 5 S.W.3d\n\n241, 253 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied). The omitted element\n\n                                              19\n\fis not presumed, deemed, or implied: it is absent from the appeal. The ground of\n\nrecovery or defense is lost because it lacks an essential element; one element has not\n\nbeen proven. See Stretcher v. Gregg, 542 S.W.2d 954, 957-58 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 1976, no writ) (party asserted defense of cancellation of a contract;\n\nby the contract’s terms, cancellation had to be in writing; trial court found the\n\ncontract was canceled but refused to find that written cancellation was made;\n\njudgment could not be affirmed based on cancellation); cf. State Dept. Highways v.\n\nPayne, 838 S.W.2d 235, 241 (Tex. 1992) (take-nothing judgment due to failure to\n\nsubmit all elements of a claim to jury).\n\n      C.     Application\n\n      Here, the trial court found that Appellant breached a contract. CR 102-106. But\n\nthe findings do not include several essential elements for a breach of contract\n\nrecovery. “Consideration is an essential element for a valid, enforceable contract.”\n\nJ.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 235 (Tex. 2003). Further, “In order\n\nto be legally binding, a contract must be sufficiently definite in its terms so that a\n\ncourt can understand what the promisor undertook.” T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank\n\nof El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex. 1992). Finally, breach is an essential element\n\nof a breach of contract claim. Valero Mkg. & Supply Co. v. Kalama Int., L.L.C., 51\n\nS.W.3d 345, 351 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.). In other words, the\n\n                                           20\n\ftrial court omitted several essential elements of a breach of contract, the only cause\n\nof action for which any element was found. See CR 102-106. The trial court and\n\nAppellee were timely notified of the deficiencies by a request for additional or\n\namended findings of fact on those precise issues. CR 97-98. Appellee did not submit\n\nthe necessary additional or amended findings of fact. The trial court did not file any\n\nadditional or amended findings on its own. As a result, essential elements that cannot\n\nbe deemed or presumed are absent from the findings, and recovery cannot be had. The\n\njudgment must be reversed and a take-nothing judgment rendered. In the alternative,\n\nthe trial court must be instructed to submit additional or amended findings.\n\nII.   No Evidence of Consideration\n\n      A.     Introduction\n\n      Even if deemed or presumed findings exist in favor of the judgment, there is\n\nstill no evidence of several essential elements for breach of contract, including\n\nconsideration. The plaintiff pled breach of contract instead of conversion to avoid the\n\nstatute of limitations. 1 RR 31 at 4-8. That, of course, is no excuse for failing to meet\n\nthe legal elements. In fact, courts are generally very skeptical of “artful pleading”\n\ndesigned to avoid the rule of law. See, e.g., Garland Community Hospital v. Rose,\n\n156 S.W.3d 541, 543 (Tex. 2004) (“Plaintiffs cannot use artful pleading to avoid the\n\n[Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act’s] requirements when the essence\n\n                                           21\n\fof the suit is a health care liability claim.”); In re Weekley Homes, L.P., 180 S.W.3d\n\n127, 131-32 (Tex. 2005) (“Under both Texas and federal law, whether a claim seeks\n\na direct benefit from a contract containing an arbitration clause turns on the substance\n\nof the claim, not artful pleading.”); Federated Dept. Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S.\n\n394, 408-09 (1981) (“[I]t would be unacceptable to permit that very plaintiff, by the\n\nartful manipulation of the terms of a complaint, to defeat a clearly enunciated\n\ncongressional objective.”).\n\n      In the no-evidence context, the evidence must be viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 819 (Tex. 2005)\n\n(“If the parties to an oral contract testify to conflicting terms, a reviewing court must\n\npresume the terms were those asserted by the winner.”). Only the plaintiff’s evidence\n\nis outlined below.\n\n      Before the transfer of the trailer to the defendant’s custody, the plaintiff was\n\npaying monthly lot rent for use of the space. 1 RR 14 at 7-14. But once the trailer was\n\nhanded to the defendant, the plaintiff did not pay her anything monthly, like rent. 1\n\nRR 18 at 16-25. No more lot rent was paid or accumulated in favor of the landlord\n\n“because she’s responsible for the house.” 1 RR 18 at 18-21.\n\n      The plaintiff insisted that she had no obligation to the defendant with respect\n\nto this arrangement.\n\n                                           22\n\f         Q:    And if she was to get any money once she sold the thing, was she\n               supposed to get her money at that time for the—up until that time\n               for the—\n         A:    For the rent? No.\n         Q:    Well, I’m talking for the lot because she’s trying to sell it.\n         A:    No.\n\n1 RR 19 at 3-9. She further insisted “I never owed that woman one penny.” 1 RR 29\n\nat 15.\n\n         Q:    Now, was there ever any exchange of money between the two of\n               you for the—for this contract?\n         A:    I have said over and again, no, there was no contract. It’s what is\n               usual—it’s what the usual policy is.\n         Q:    So let me ask my question again. Was there ever any exchange of\n               money or goods or services between the two of you to support\n               this contract.\n         A:    Well, she sent two 200-dollar checks she owed me.\n         Q:    Ms. Swansen, at the time that you made this agreement—\n         A:    No.\n\n2 RR 25-26.\n\n         B.    Law\n\n         “Consideration is an essential element for a valid, enforceable contract.” J.M.\n\nDavidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 235 (Tex. 2003). Without it, there is no\n\nenforceable contract between the parties. Agreements to gratuitously perform actions\n\nfor other people are not enforceable. See English v. Fischer, 660 S.W.2d 521, 523\n\n(Tex. 1983). The plaintiff could have pursued a promissory estoppel claim to avoid\n\nthe requirement of consideration but she chose not to. See id. As a result, she must\n\n                                            23\n\fsatisfy the legal elements of a breach of contract claim. It is worth noting that\n\nalthough consideration is presumed in a written contract, it is not presumed for an\n\noral contract. Compare Okemah Const., Inc. v. Barkley-Farmer, Inc., 583 S.W.2d\n\n458, 460 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1979, no writ) to Blockbuster, Inc. v.\n\nC-Span Entm’t, Inc., 276 S.W.3d 482, 488 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet. granted,\n\njudg’t vacated w.r.m.)\n\n      Consideration is a bargained-for exchange of promises; it consists of benefits\n\nand detriments to the contracting parties. Federal Sign v. Texas S. Univ., 951 S.W.2d\n\n401, 409 (Tex. 1997). “Lack of consideration occurs when the contract, at its\n\ninception, does not impose obligations on both parties.” Burges v. Mosley, 304\n\nS.W.3d 623, 628 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2010, no pet.).\n\n      C.     Application\n\n      It is entirely unclear what the consideration could be in this case: what\n\nobligation was imposed on the plaintiff? The “contract,” as described in the findings,\n\nwas “a valid oral contractual agreement via the exchange of mutual promises under\n\nwhich Defendant agreed to find a buy for the park model home.” CR 102. What the\n\nplaintiff described is not an “exchange of mutual promises” because there is no\n\nobligation on her. According to her, Appellant gratuitously offered to sell her trailer\n\nfor her. See 1 RR 17-18. Later in the findings, the contract is described as “the oral\n\n                                          24\n\fcontract to hold such title until a buyer could be find.” CR 103. Again, that does not\n\ndescribe consideration.\n\n       Since there is no evidence on this essential element of the plaintiff’s breach of\n\ncontract claim, a take-nothing judgment must be rendered.\n\nIII.   Indefinite Contract\n\n       A.    Introduction\n\n       Not only is there no consideration to the contract, the entire nature of the\n\ncontract is unclear. The findings refer to the contract as “a valid oral contractual\n\nagreement via the exchange of mutual promises under which Defendant agreed to find\n\na buy for the park model home.” CR 102. They also describe it as “the oral contract\n\nto hold such title until a buyer could be find.” CR 103. What rights and obligations\n\nwere conferred by the contract are unknown.\n\n       B.    Law\n\n       Indefiniteness is a question of law for the court. Fiduciary Fin. Serv. of the Sw.,\n\nInc. v. Corilant Financial, LP, 376 S.W.3d 253, 256 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet.\n\ndenied). “The rules regarding indefiniteness of material terms of a contract are based\n\non the concept that a party cannot accept an offer so as to form a contract unless the\n\nterms of that contract are reasonably certain.” Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Fort\n\nWorth, 22 S.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000). “In order to be legally binding, a contract\n\n                                           25\n\fmust be sufficiently definite in its terms so that a court can understand what the\n\npromisor undertook.” T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 221\n\n(Tex. 1992). Each material term must be agreed upon. Id. For example, in an\n\nagreement to loan money, the material terms include the amount to be loaned,\n\nmaturity date of the loan, the interest rate, and the repayment terms. Id. If there is no\n\nevidence of any of those terms, the contract fails for indefiniteness. Id. “It is well\n\nsettled law that when an agreement leaves material matters open for future adjustment\n\nand agreement that never occur, it is not binding upon the parties and merely\n\nconstitutes an agreement to agree.” Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Fort Worth, 22\n\nS.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000).\n\n      “Fatal indefiniteness in an agreement may concern the time of performance, the\n\nprice to be paid, the work to be done, the service to be rendered or the property to be\n\ntransferred.” COC Serv., Ltd. v. CompUSA, Inc., 150 S.W.3d 654, 664 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2004, pet. denied). For example, in a divorce, it is too vague for a\n\nmother to agree to “continue to pay as much as possible toward [her son’s] needs,\n\nlimited only by her personal financial situation.” Chavez. v. McNeely, 287 S.W.3d\n\n840, 845 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.). In a lease, failing to identify\n\na term for the lease and failing to provide dates for commencing and ending the lease\n\nresults in a contract being indefinite. Southern v. Goetting, 353 S.W.3d 295, 300\n\n                                           26\n\f(Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, pet. denied). Specific evidence must be adduced as to the\n\nobligations and liabilities of both parties: if the only evidence in the record on a\n\nparty’s obligation under a contract is that “[the contracting party] told [the other\n\nparty] he had contacts and outlets and he could ‘help [the other party] do all this\n\nstuff,’” that is insufficient. Lamajak, Inc. v. Frazin, 230 S.W.3d 786, 795 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2007, no pet.).\n\n       B.     Facts\n\n       In this case, the alleged contract is so vague as to be meaningless. The plaintiff\n\nasserted that the trailer was to be held by Appellant until it was sold. 1 RR 18. How\n\nlong was it to be held for? Would Appellant have been liable if the trailer were never\n\nsold? Was she required to use best efforts to procure a buyer? By what terms could\n\nthe trailer have been sold: rent-to-own, cash payment, or periodic payments? None\n\nof these terms are in the record. Even further, there is absolutely no guidance as to\n\nwhat the obligations of the plaintiff would be. Would she be liable to pay Appellant\n\na fee or a portion of the money received for the trailer? Would she have to advise her\n\nthroughout the process? Were there any other duties for her? Were there no duties at\n\nall? Again, it is entirely unclear. As a result, the contract fails for lack of definiteness,\n\nand a take-nothing judgment must be rendered. See T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank\n\nof El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 224 (Tex. 1992) (rendering take-nothing judgment on\n\n                                             27\n\fcontract claim due to indefiniteness).\n\nIV.   No Evidence of Breach\n\n      A.     Introduction\n\n      Even if there were an enforceable contract between the parties, due to the lack\n\nof findings on the issue, it would be difficult to determine what the contractual\n\nobligations of the parties were. See supra Parts I & III. According to the findings of\n\nfact, there was “a valid oral contractual agreement via the exchange of mutual\n\npromises under which Defendant agreed to find a buyer for the park model home.”\n\nCR 102. The findings go on regarding breach as follows:\n\n      6.     In May 2010, after the conclusion of litigation in a justice court\n             in Smith County, Texas which had resulted in a judgment\n             unfavorable to Defendant, without the knowledge or consent of\n             the Plaintiff, and without payment of any consideration, the\n             Defendant breached the oral contract to hold such title until a\n             buyer could be found.\n\n      7      In May 2010 the Defendant, unilaterally and without the payment\n             of any consideration for the sale of such park model home,\n             wrongfully affixed her own name to the application for title as\n             Buyer and then remitted the title to the said park model home to\n             the State of Texas further breaching such oral contract and\n             resulting in the issuance of a new certificate of title by the state of\n             Texas reflecting Defendant as owner.\n\nCR 103. There is no dispute that Appellant put her name on the title, but that is not\n\na breach of the plaintiff’s alleged contract. It is also important to note that there are\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\fno findings that the contract was breached by the failure, if any, to send payments\n\nmade for the sale of the home to the plaintiff.\n\n      B.     Law\n\n      Unsurprisingly, breach is an essential element of a breach of contract cause of\n\naction. Valero Mkg. & Supply Co. v. Kalama Int., L.L.C., 51 S.W.3d 345, 351 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.). “When the evidence is undisputed\n\nregarding a person's conduct under a contract, the court as a matter of law determines\n\nwhether the conduct shows performance or breach of a contract obligation.” Id.\n\n      C.     Application\n\n      There is no dispute that Appellant put her name on the title. The issue here is\n\nwhether that is a breach of the plaintiff’s alleged contract. According to the findings,\n\nthe contract required Appellant to find a buyer for the home. CR 103. She did find a\n\nbuyer (at least at one point) and received money from him. 2 RR 57. The plaintiff\n\nwanted to receive money from that arrangement, but the findings did not find a breach\n\nbased on failure to forward payments to her. See CR 102-06. That ground of recovery\n\nhas been waived. Sufficiency of the evidence is measured by the findings of fact: the\n\nquestion here is whether the findings are supported by evidence. Lindner v. Hill, 673\n\nS.W.2d 611, 614 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1984, aff’d Lindner v. Hill, 691 S.W.2d\n\n590 (Tex. 1985); Tex. R. Civ. P. 298 (“No findings or conclusions shall be deemed\n\n                                          29\n\for presumed by any failure of the court to make any additional findings or\n\nconclusions.”). There is no pleading nor a finding that Appellant breached the\n\ncontract by failing to forward payments for the home.\n\n      The only allegation is that Appellant breached the contract by filling in her\n\nname on the title. It is possible that it would be conversion if the trailer were not\n\nreturned after a demand. See Burns v. Rochon, 190 S.W.3d 263, 268 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.). But the plaintiff did not sue for conversion\n\ndue to the statute of limitations. 1 RR 31. It is not a breach of contract. The terms of\n\na contract are determined at the time of the original formation. See T.O. Stanley Boot\n\nCo. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex. 1992) (“The material terms of the\n\ncontract must be agreed upon before a court can enforce the contract.”) (emphasis\n\nadded). When the parties formed the alleged contract, the agreement did not include\n\nanything about the title. It could not have, because the plaintiff did not send Appellant\n\nthe title until after the alleged contract would have been formed. 1 RR 20. That\n\ntransfer was not Appellant’s idea, but rather one of the plaintiff’s neighbors. 1 RR 20.\n\nAny modification, such as an additional requirement that Appellant not affix her\n\nname to the title, would have to be supported by additional consideration. Hathaway\n\nv. General Mills, Inc., 711 S.W.2d 227, 228 (Tex. 1986). The findings expressly\n\nreject that there was any new or additional consideration for such a modification. CR\n\n                                           30\n\f103.\n\nV.     Award of Specific Property\n\n       A.    Introduction\n\n       After finding that Appellant breached the contract, no damages were awarded.\n\nCR 74-77. Rather, the court ordered the plaintiff to recover a specific piece of\n\nproperty from her, namely the trailer. CR 74-75. That is not a proper remedy for\n\nbreach of contract.\n\n       B.    Law\n\n       The ordinary remedy for breach of contract is damages. See DiGiuseppe v.\n\nLawler, 269 S.W.3d 588, 593 (Tex. 2008) (explaining additional elements in breach\n\nof contract cases required in order to obtain specific performance). Extraordinary\n\nremedies include specific performance, rescission, and reformation.\n\n       Specific performance of the contract is clearly inapposite, as the remedy would\n\nbe an order that Appellant perform under the contract. See Stafford v. S. Vanity\n\nMagazine, Inc., 231 S.W.3d 530, 535 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007, pet. denied).\n\nPresumably, that would be done by selling the trailer, not returning it.\n\n       In the plaintiff’s petition, she prays for “reformation.” CR 6, Paragraph 6. But\n\nthat does not quite fit. Reformation is a remedy for a mistake, typically mutual, such\n\nas a mistake in reducing an agreement to writing. See, e.g., Cherokee Water Co. v.\n\n                                          31\n\fForderhause, 741 S.W.2d 377, 379 (Tex. 1987) (“The underlying objective of\n\nreformation is to correct a mutual mistake made in preparing a written instrument, so\n\nthat the instrument truly reflects the original agreement of the parties.”); Miles v.\n\nMartin, 321 S.W.2d 62, 67 (Tex. 1959) (mistake of law).\n\n        The last available remedy is rescission. “Rescission of contract is an equitable\n\nremedy, with the measure of damages generally being return of the consideration paid\n\ntogether with such further special damage or expense as may have been reasonably\n\nincurred by the party wronged on account of the contract.” Denver City Indep. Sch.\n\nDist. v. Moses, 51 S.W.3d 386, 391 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, no pet.). The trailer\n\nwas not the consideration paid by the plaintiff. As discussed above in Part II, there\n\nwas no consideration. If there were any consideration, it would certainly not have\n\nbeen the trailer, which, according to the plaintiff, Appellant was not supposed to\n\nkeep.\n\n        Further, rescission takes more than simple breach of contract. It “is an equitable\n\nremedy that operates to extinguish a contract that is legally valid but must be set aside\n\ndue to fraud, mistake, or for some other reason to avoid unjust enrichment.” Gentry\n\nv. Squires Const., Inc., 188 S.W.3d 396, 410 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.). For\n\nexample, mutual mistake will allow it. Myrad Properties v. LaSalle Bank Nat’l Ass’n,\n\n300 S.W.3d 746, 751 (Tex. 2009). Fraud also makes it available. Texas Capital\n\n                                            32\n\fSecurities, Inc. v. Sandefer, 58 S.W.3d 760, 773 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2001, pet. denied).\n\n      There are additional requirements to a breach of contract claim when seeking\n\nrescission, such as notice and tender. Cruz v. Andrews Restoration, Inc., 364 S.W.3d\n\n817, 824 (Tex. 2012). “Notice and tender” means that the party requesting rescission\n\nmust prove that he offered to put the other party in the position it was in before the\n\ncontract was entered. Id. In other words, “before a rescission can be granted, the\n\nparties must be placed in status quo.” Mathis Equipment Co. v. Rosson, 386 S.W.2d\n\n854, 869-70 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1964, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see also Gentry,\n\n188 S.W.3d at 410. Appellant paid taxes and insurance on the trailer while it was in\n\nher possession. 2 RR 60-63; Exhibits 6 & 7. Those expenses have not been repaid to\n\nher and were not awarded in the court’s judgment. CR 74-77. The burden is on the\n\nplaintiff to prove that she paid those back. Rosson, 386 S.W.2d at 869-70.\n\n      There are other causes of action that allow for the recovery of specific pieces\n\nof property. The most obvious example is conversion: “A plaintiff who establishes\n\nconversion is entitled to return of the property and damages for loss of use during the\n\ntort-feasor's detention. Alternatively, the injured party can sue for the value of the\n\nproperty.” Winkle Chevy-Olds-Pontiac, Inc. v. Condon, 830 S.W.2d 740, 746 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1992, writ dism’d) (citations omitted). A constructive trust can\n\n                                          33\n\falso be imposed after a finding of fraud in certain situations. See, e.g., Schlueter v.\n\nSchlueter, 975 S.W.2d 584, 588 (Tex. 1998) (fraud on the community in divorce\n\nproceeding). It may also be imposed if there is a breach of fiduciary duty. Meadows\n\nv. Bierschwale, 516 S.W.2d 125, 128 (Tex. 1974) (“It is not essential for the\n\napplication of the constructive trust doctrine that a fiduciary relationship exist\n\nbetween the wrongdoer and the beneficial owner. Actual fraud, as well as breach of\n\na confidential relationship, justifies the imposition of a constructive trust.”). Breach\n\nof contract is not enough to impose a constructive trust. “This court has held that\n\nmere breach of an oral contract is not fraud and that subsequent breach is not\n\nevidence that may be considered in determining whether or not there was fraud in the\n\noriginal transaction.” Thigpen v. Locke, 363 S.W.2d 247, 252 (Tex. 1962). Fraud was\n\nneither pleaded nor proved in this case.\n\n      Neither did Appellee plead or prove the existence of any kind of fiduciary or\n\nconfidential relationship between the parties. The landlord-tenant relationship is not\n\none of trust and confidence in general. See West Anderson Plaza v. Feyznia, 876\n\nS.W.2d 528, 534 (Tex. App.—Austin 1994, no writ) (finding that a landlord and\n\ntenant did not have a confidential or fiduciary relationship). And there are no specific\n\nfacts or circumstances in this case that would establish the existence of such a\n\nrelationship.\n\n                                           34\n\f      C.     Conclusion\n\n      Since the Appellee did not plead or prove any causes of action that would\n\nsupport the imposition of a constructive trust or the recovery of a specific piece of\n\nproperty, the court’s judgment awarding the trailer to the Appellee was improper.\n\nThere is no evidence to support that recovery, so that portion of the judgment must\n\nbe reversed. Thigpen v. Locke, 363 S.W.2d 247, 253 (Tex. 1962) (affirming take-\n\nnothing judgment on request for imposition of a constructive trust).\n\nVI.   No Evidence of Attorneys’ Fees\n\n      A.     Introduction\n\n      The court awarded $11,443.67 in attorneys’ fees. CR 105. The only evidence\n\nsupporting that amount is the testimony of the plaintiff’s attorney. He took the case\n\non a forty percent contingency. 2 RR 78 at 13-15. He testified that the going rate for\n\na case like this is $250 per hour. 2 RR 78 at 8-11. He flatly stated that “the amount\n\nof time expended on the case was necessary and reasonable in the representation of\n\nthe client in this case. Totaled at $250 an hour, $12,938.85.” 2 RR 78 at 20-22.\n\nDividing $12,938.85 by $250 to find out the number of hours he spent arrives at\n\n51.7554 hours, which is odd because very few attorneys take note of their time to the\n\nfourth decimal place. 0.0001 of an hour is equal to roughly a third of a second, so that\n\nwould be refreshingly precise timekeeping. It also just so happens that the amount is\n\n                                          35\n\f“equivalent” to his contingency fee if the trailer were worth $33,000, the amount the\n\nplaintiff says she paid for it. 2 RR 79 at 2-5; 2 RR 13 at 9-11. Mr. Hindman did not\n\nexplain how much time he spent, what he spent his time on, the skill required to do\n\nwhatever he did, the novelty or difficulty involved in the case, whether he was\n\nprecluded from other work, time limitations imposed by the client, or his experience\n\nand reputation. See 2 RR 79-80.\n\n      B.     Law\n\n      Although the plaintiff in a breach of contract case does not have to use the\n\nlodestar method to prove up attorneys’ fees, he may elect to do so. United Nat’l Ins.\n\nCo. v. A.M.J. Investments, L.L.C., No. 14-12-00941-CV at *23 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2014, pet. filed) (quoting Long v. Griffin, Case No. 11-1021 at *4 (Tex.\n\n2014) (per curiam) (“The affidavit supporting the Griffins’ request for attorney’s fees\n\nused the lodestar method by relating the hours worked for each of the two attorneys\n\nmultiplied by their hourly rates for a total fee.”)). Testifying to the number of hours\n\nworked and a reasonable hourly rate is an election to use the lodestar method. Id.\n\n      That election has consequences: “a party choosing the lodestar method of\n\nproving attorney's fees must provide evidence of the time expended on specific tasks\n\nto enable the fact finder to meaningfully review the fee application.” Long, Case No.\n\n11-1021 at *1. The testifying attorney should testify so that the court can discern how\n\n                                          36\n\fmany hours were required to perform each task in the representation and whether that\n\ntime was reasonable. El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 763 (Tex. 2012).\n\nAlthough documentary evidence (such as time records or billing statements) is not\n\nrequired, “in all but the simplest cases, the attorney would probably have to refer to\n\nsome type of record or documentation to provide this information.” City of Laredo\n\nv. Montano, 414 S.W.3d 731, 736 (Tex. 2013).\n\n      C.     Conclusion\n\n      Mr. Hindman’s testimony lacks the specificity required by the lodestar method\n\nfor calculating attorneys’ fees. It is general and conclusory. He states the amount of\n\ntime spent on the case without providing any means for the court to analyze whether\n\nthe tasks performed were necessary and the time spent on them reasonable. That\n\ninformation must be provided so that the court can determine whether his analysis is\n\ncorrect.\n\n      The remedy for a failure to properly establish attorneys’ fees by the lodestar\n\nmethod is a remand for a determination of the properly-documented amount. See El\n\nApple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 765 (Tex. 2012). The plaintiff will still have\n\nan opportunity to prove up her attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\fVII. Failure to Segregate Attorneys’ Fees by Cause of Action\n\n      A.     Introduction\n\n      The plaintiff’s attorney testified that he incurred $12,938.85 in attorneys’ fees\n\nbut he did not specify what he did. More importantly, he did not explain whether that\n\nwork was done on the contract cause of action or one of the others. See 2 RR 78-79.\n\nHe testified that he not only filed the case for breach of contract but also for a\n\nDeclaratory Judgment. 2 RR 79 at 14-19. The plaintiff’s petition does not mention the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act. CR 4-9. It does mention trusts and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty, though. CR 5 (title was “left in trust” with Appellant); CR 6 (changing name on\n\ntitle was “in violation [of] Defendant’s fiduciary duty under the oral contract to the\n\nPlaintiff at a time while the Defendant was holding the partially completed title\n\napplication form as a fiduciary”).\n\n      B.     Law\n\n      Attorney’s fees are not recoverable for breach of fiduciary duty. Western\n\nReserve Life Assurance Co. of Ohio v. Graben, 233 S.W.3d 360, 377 (Tex. App.—Ft.\n\nWorth 2007, no pet.). Attorney’s fees are recoverable for breach of contract cases\n\n(assuming proper presentment). Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.001. When a\n\nplaintiff proceeds under two different claims, he must segregate out attorneys’ fees\n\nincurred in prosecuting claims for which fees are recoverable and claims for which\n\n                                          38\n\fthey are not. Tony Gullo Motors I, LP v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006).\n\nSince the record does not reflect what the plaintiff’s attorney did for the breach of\n\ncontract claim versus on the breach of fiduciary claim, a remand is required. See id.\n\nat 314.\n\nVIII. Failure to Segregate Attorneys’ Fees by Time\n\n      The plaintiff was awarded attorneys’ fees in the judgment. CR 75. Those fees\n\nwere awarded for prevailing on a breach of contract claim. According to the\n\nplaintiff’s attorney, he presented the claim for breach of contract to Appellant during\n\nthe pendency of this lawsuit. 2 RR 79 at 9-11. He did not say when. See 2 RR 79.\n\n      Presentment is a prerequisite for recovering attorneys’ fees for breach of\n\ncontract. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.002. Obviously, the attorneys’ fees must\n\nhave been incurred after the date of presentment. “The purpose of presentment is to\n\nallow the opposing party a reasonable opportunity to pay a claim without incurring\n\nan obligation for attorney's fees.” Brainard v. Trinity Universal Ins. Co., 216 S.W.3d\n\n809, 818 (Tex. 2006). If the attorneys’ fees are incurred before the date of breach and\n\npresentment, they are not recoverable. See id.\n\n      Here, the presentment was made after suit was filed, but no date was provided.\n\nSee 2 RR 79. That makes it impossible to determine what fees were incurred before\n\nor after the date of presentment. The plaintiff’s attorney did not segregate them out\n\n                                          39\n\fhimself. See 2 RR 78-79. He even included $504.82 of court costs in his calculation.\n\n2 RR 78 at 24. Just as it is the attorney’s duty to segregate fees between causes of\n\naction for which they are recoverable and those for which they are not, it was the\n\nplaintiff’s attorney’s duty to segregate fees incurred before the date of presentment\n\nand fees incurred after the date of presentment. Cf. Tony Gullo Motors I, LP v.\n\nChapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006). The remedy for failure to segregate is a\n\nnew trial on the issue of attorney’s fees. Id. at 314.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      Appellant respectfully prays that this Court render a take-nothing judgment; in\n\nthe alternative, abate the appeal for the trial court to enter additional or amended\n\nfindings of fact; or in the alternative, grant a new trial on the amount of attorneys’\n\nfees that should have been awarded.\n\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        SNOW E.

CR 4-9. After a bench trial, the\n\ntrial court awarded the plaintiff recovery of a specific piece of property, namely a\n\ntrailer, as well as attorneys’ fees. CR 74-77.\n\n                      REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      Because the case is relatively complex and has a convoluted fact pattern, oral\n\nargument may assist the court’s decisional process.\n\n                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.    What is the effect of the trial court’s refusal to file additional findings of fact\n      after a request?\n\n2.    Is there any evidence of consideration for the alleged oral contract?\n\n3.    Is the alleged oral contract insufficiently definite for enforcement?\n\n4.    Is there any evidence that the alleged contract was breached?\n\n5.    Was it proper for the trial court to award recovery of a specific piece of\n      property for a simple breach of contract?\n\n6.    Is there sufficient evidence of attorneys’ fees?\n\n7.    Did the plaintiff’s attorney properly segregate his attorneys’ fees by cause of\n      action?\n\n8.    Did the plaintiff’s attorney properly segregate his attorneys’ fees by time\n      relative to the date of presentment of his breach of contract claim?\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      According to the plaintiff, Mary Swansen, the story proceeds as follows. The\n\nnext four paragraphs are based entirely on her testimony unless otherwise noted.\n\n      Sometime in the beginning of 2007, the plaintiff bought a 20-foot mobile home\n\n(also called a park trailer because it is so small) worth $50,000 for $33,000 in 2006.\n\n1 RR 7-9 & 13; Defendant’s Exhibit 1 (attached to the end of Volume 1 of the\n\nReporter’s Record). She rented a lot for it from the Appellant, Tonda Helms, for $225\n\nper month. 1 RR 14. After about a year, the plaintiff married a man in Kansas who\n\nalready had a home, so she decided to get rid of it. 1 RR 15. Since a realtor’s office\n\ndid not want to sell it for her, she decided to sell it through Appellant, her landlord.\n\n1 RR 16. The plaintiff asked Appellant to offer it at $50,000 and then gradually\n\nreduce the asking price to $25,000. 1 RR 18.\n\n      There was no written contract between the parties. 1 RR 17. There was no\n\nobligation flowing from the plaintiff to Appellant: at the time, the plaintiff did not\n\nowe any rent, as she had paid every month. 1 RR 14. Lot rent did not continue to\n\naccumulate after she asked Appellant to sell the trailer for her, either, so no money\n\nwas owed to Appellant at all. 1 RR 18. No money was to be made by Appellant. 1 RR\n\n19.\n\n      Soon thereafter, Appellant sold the trailer to a man for monthly payments. 1 RR\n\n                                           8\n\f19. The plaintiff found out in January of 2010 and filed a suit in small claims court.\n\n1 RR 20. When the judge announced that she would not prevail, she began crying, so\n\nhe changed his decision so that she would recover the trailer. 1 RR 22. On appeal to\n\nthe County Court at Law #3 for Smith County, her case was dismissed. 1 RR 23-24.\n\nHer representative on appeal was Appellant’s former handyman, Nathan McCarty, an\n\nunlicensed individual. 2 RR 28-29 & 39-40; Exhibit 5. According to him, he cannot\n\nread but is able to copy whatever he sees. 2 RR 40-41. Her original appellate attorney\n\nhad withdrawn due and put in the motion that he had a conflict with her, but that was\n\nnot his real reason. 2 RR 17. “He preferred to say that than what he told me, that he\n\ndidn’t work with a crooked judge.” 2 RR 17 at 16-17. The plaintiff then went to\n\nanother justice of the peace to get a writ of possession. He refused to accept a check,\n\ndemanding cash, and after she put $150 in his hand, he slammed the door shut and\n\nrefused to do anything else. 1 RR 25-26.\n\n      She filed judicial complaints against all three judges that had handled the case.\n\n2 RR 20. Afterwards, she contacted the local sheriff, the constable, the Texas\n\nRangers, and the U.S. Attorney’s office but each refused to get involved. 1 RR 32-33\n\n& 35. The plaintiff ultimately filed this suit in 2013, claiming that an oral contract\n\nbetween the parties had been breached. CR 4-7. She did not file it as conversion claim\n\nbecause the statute of limitations had already run. 1 RR 31.\n\n                                           9\n\f      Appellant had a very different recollection of events. According to her, the\n\ntrailer was given to her in payment for back rent that was owed. 2 RR 44-45, 51-52\n\n& 58. Appellant buys and sells mobile homes often, particularly when back rent is\n\nowed, but ordinarily it is done through a bank mortgage. 2 RR 53-54. When the bank\n\nforecloses and sells a mobile home owned by someone that owes Appellant for rent,\n\nshe bids on it, and if she wins, then she deducts the amount owed to her from the\n\npayment she makes on the trailer. 2 RR 54. The arrangement is similar to an offset.\n\n      This sale worked somewhat differently because there was no bank involved.\n\nAppellant made efforts to sell the home, including putting ads in the Tyler Paper and\n\nthe Thrifty Nickel and placing signs in front of the park and on the home. 2 RR 103.\n\nBut the house did not sell and lot rent continued to accrue month after month while\n\nthe trailer sat on Appellant’s property. 2 RR 86 at 10-15; 2 RR 94. Since the plaintiff\n\nwas going to lose the home anyway, and her debt to Appellant was accumulating, she\n\ngave it to Appellant as full payment for money owed. 2 RR 52. 2 RR 64.\n\n      The plaintiff admitted that she declared bankruptcy in May of 2008. 1 RR 58\n\nat 8-10; Exhibit 2, Page 2. In the bankruptcy petition, she listed herself as owning no\n\nreal property and a total of $5,575 in personal property (including clothing, jewelry,\n\nbooks, and a 2006 Saturn Ion). 1 RR 64-66. She did not include the trailer she valued\n\nat $50,000 in that list. 1 RR 64-66; Exhibit 2, Page 17-19. According to her, she\n\n                                          10\n\fforgot about it. 1 RR 67 at 3-5. Her debts totaled $142,561.00. Exhibit 2 at Page 33.\n\n      The buyer for the trailer was found in September of 2009, after the trailer\n\nwould have gone to the plaintiff’s creditors in bankruptcy if she had kept it herself.\n\n2 RR 87 at 21-23. Nevertheless, the plaintiff has tried two times without legal process\n\nto remove the home from Appellant’s property. 2 RR 88.\n\n      The trial court found that a contract existed between the parties and that it had\n\nbeen breached and awarded the plaintiff recovery of the trailer home and attorneys’\n\nfees. CR 74-77.\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial court, after request, made findings of fact but refused to file additional\n\nfindings on certain key elements of the plaintiff’s breach of contract case, including\n\nwhat the consideration for the contract was, what the material terms of the contract\n\nwere, what terms were breached, and the date of presentment of the breach of contract\n\nclaim. The missing findings cannot be deemed or presumed on appeal because there\n\nwas a timely request that notified the trial court of the problem. Therefore, elements\n\nof the plaintiff’s case are absent, which results in a take-nothing judgment.\n\n      Even if there were presumed or deemed findings in favor of the judgment, there\n\nis no evidence of consideration. The plaintiff’s case rests on the notion that Appellant\n\ngratuitously agreed to sell her trailer home for her. That is not a contract because it\n\n                                           11\n\flacks consideration.\n\n      The alleged contract is also insufficiently definite to be enforced. It is entirely\n\nunclear from the record what the terms were supposed to have been. Without\n\nguidance as to the rights and obligations of each party, a contract is unenforceable.\n\n      There is no evidence of breach. In the findings and judgment, the agreement\n\nwas that Appellant would sell the plaintiff’s trailer. The trailer was sold. The findings\n\nand judgment indicate that there was a breach because Appellant put her name on the\n\ntitle to the trailer, but there was no agreement in the original terms that Appellant\n\nwould not do that.\n\n      There is also no evidence to support the award of attorneys’ fees. The\n\nplaintiff’s attorney elected to proceed under the lodestar method but he did not detail\n\nwhat he did and how long it took him. He merely stated that his time is worth $250\n\nan hour and he has accumulated $12,938.85 in bills. Dividing that out, it means that\n\nhe spent 51.7554 hours on the case, but more specificity is required in order for the\n\njudge to be able to consider the reasonableness and necessity of the activities\n\nperformed in the case.\n\n      Even if there is evidence to support the award of attorneys’ fees, they have not\n\nbeen segregated by cause of action. The plaintiff proceeded under multiple other legal\n\ntheories which were abandoned after trial. He did not segregate work performed in\n\n                                           12\n\fthose causes out from the breach of contract action.\n\n      The plaintiff’s attorney also did not segregate his fees by time relative to\n\npresentment. He stated that he made presentment after suit was filed but failed to say\n\nthe precise date, and he did not state which fees were incurred before rather than after\n\nthe presentment. Since fees incurred before the date of presentment are not\n\nrecoverable, a new trial on attorneys’ fees is required to segregate our recoverable\n\nfrom unrecoverable fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                                   ARGUMENT\n\nI.    Refusal to Make Additional Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n      A.     Introduction\n\n      After the court entered its final judgment, Appellant timely filed a Request for\n\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law under Tex. R. Civ. P. 296. CR 88-89. The\n\ntrial court did not file its findings within the twenty-day time period prescribed by\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 297, so Appellant filed and served a Notice of Past Due Findings of\n\nFact and Conclusions of Law. CR 91-92. After Appellee filed her proposed findings,\n\nthe trial court signed and adopted them. CR 102-106. These findings abandoned\n\nseveral of the plaintiff’s causes of action, including breach of trust and breach of\n\nfiduciary duty. CR 5. The only remaining cause of action was breach of contract. See\n\nCR 102-106.\n\n      The findings did not include all the essential elements of a breach of contract:\n\nthere are no findings on what the terms of the contract were, what term was breached,\n\nor what was the consideration given by each party. See CR 102-106. The only finding\n\nof fact on the existence of the contract is a conclusory statement that “the parties\n\nentered into a valid oral contractual agreement via the exchange of mutual promises\n\nunder which Defendant agreed to find a buyer for the park model home.” CR 102.\n\nSince these facts are critical to the outcome of this appeal, Appellant filed a Request\n\n                                          14\n\ffor Additional or Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. CR 97-98. The\n\nfollowing findings were requested:\n\n      1.   The consideration given by each party to the contract.\n      2.   The material terms of the contract between the parties.\n      3.   Which material term was breached, and by what specific act.\n      4.   The date the claim for breach of contract was presented to the\n      Defendant under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.002.\n\nCR 97. The trial court never filed any additional findings.\n\n      B.     Effect of Failure to File Additional or Amended Findings\n\n      The Rules clearly state the effect of a court’s refusal to make appropriate\n\nfindings: “No findings or conclusions shall be deemed or presumed by any failure of\n\nthe court to make any additional findings or conclusions.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 298. Since\n\nthe findings of fact are treated as jury verdicts on special questions, Anderson v. City\n\nof Seven Points, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1519282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1519282/anderson-v-city-of-seven-points/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794 (Tex. 1991), and it is axiomatic that all\n\nessential elements of a claim must be found in order for recovery, it would seem\n\nstraightforward that, after notice, failing to find an essential element of a claim would\n\nresult in a take-nothing judgment. The path to that simple result is complicated,\n\nthough, and it depends in large part on the efforts of the parties to preserve error.\n\n      If there is neither a reporter’s record nor findings of fact, the appellate court\n\nassumes the trial court heard sufficient evidence to make any and all the necessary\n\nfindings to support the judgment. Vickery v. Commission for Lawyer Discipline, 5\n\n                                           1</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192358\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192358/vickery-v-commission-for-lawyer-discipline/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied). In other\n\nwords, the appeal is immediately lost and there is no appellate review.\n\n      If a reporter’s record is filed but no findings of fact are requested or made, it\n\nis again implied that the trial court made any and all necessary findings to support the\n\njudgment. Worford v. Stamper, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (Tex. 1990). But since there is\n\na reporter’s record, the appellate court can review the sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport those implied findings. See id. The court affirms the judgment if it can be\n\nsupported by any legal theory in the evidence. Id.\n\n      If a reporter’s record is filed and findings of fact are made, the findings will be\n\nsustained if there is any evidence to support them (instead of the judgment). Lindner\n\nv. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 614 (Tex.

Rather than pore over an entire record and create a set\n\nof hypothetical findings for all the determinative facts of the case, the court of appeals\n\nonly looks to the findings of fact and decides whether they are supported by the\n\nevidence. This approach narrows the issues on appeal: the factual findings are the\n\nequivalent of a jury verdict on special issues. Id.\n\n      The question remains of what to do if necessary findings are omitted. For\n\nexample, if a plaintiff sues for negligence, and the trial court makes findings that the\n\ndefendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care, the defendant caused the plaintiff’s\n\n                                           16\n\finjuries, and the injuries are compensable in the amount of $100,000, there is an\n\nomitted element of the case: the trial court did not make a finding that the defendant\n\nbreached its duty of care. D. Houston, Inc. v. Love, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1752403\"><a href=\"/opinion/1752403/d-houston-inc-v-love/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (Tex. 2002)\n\n(stating essential elements of a negligence claim). Does the court revert to the default\n\napproach of affirming so long as the omitted findings have support in the evidence?\n\n      There are two steps to answer this question. First, the appellate court\n\ndetermines whether the omitted finding is of an entire ground of recovery or defense,\n\nno element which has been found by the trial court. Tex. R. Civ. P. 299. In that case,\n\nthe ground of recovery or defense is waived. Tex. R. Civ. P. 299 (“The judgment may\n\nnot be supported upon appeal by a presumed finding upon any ground of recovery or\n\ndefense, no element of which has been included in the findings of fact.”). If at least\n\none element of the ground of recovery or defense is included in the findings, the next\n\nquestion is whether the complaining party notified the trial court of the omitted\n\nelements. If no complaint was made (via request), the unrequested elements are\n\nsupplied by presumption. Tex. R. Civ. P. 299 (“[W]hen one or more elements thereof\n\nhave been found by the trial court, omitted unrequested elements, when supported by\n\nevidence, will be supplied by presumption in support of the judgment”). If the trial\n\ncourt is notified of the omission, the ground of recovery or defense is waived. Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 298 (“No findings or conclusions shall be deemed or presumed by any\n\n                                          17\n\ffailure of the court to make any additional findings or conclusions.”)\n\n      It works similarly to omissions from a jury charge: if the entire ground of\n\nrecovery or defense is omitted, that ground of recovery or defense is waived entirely.\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 279. If one or more elements of the ground of recovery or defense is\n\nsubmitted, but others are omitted, and no objection or request is made, then the\n\nomitted elements are supplied by implication. Tex. R. Civ. P. 279. But if an essential\n\nelement is not submitted, and the defect is brought to the court’s attention in a timely\n\nmanner by request, and the jury charge is still submitted in that defective manner, the\n\nresult is a take-nothing judgment.

The answers to the special issues do not include all the necessary\n\nelements of the claim, and without all essential elements, a claim fails.

As with a trial objection, it is incumbent on the appealing\n\nparty to point out distinctively the issue to the trial court to give it an opportunity to\n\ncorrect the mistake. Id. The objection cannot be confounded by voluminous\n\nunfounded objections. Id. The requested findings must relate to the ultimate or\n\ncontrolling legal issues, not just issues of evidence. Texas E.

The purpose of the rule is to require the trial court to\n\nspecify the basis for its own decision, thus narrowing the issues on appeal. That\n\npurpose is not served by requiring the submission of proposed findings that will be\n\nsummarily rejected and ignored.\n\n         The situation we are left with is one in which the trial court has made findings\n\nof fact, including one element of a ground of recovery or defense, but which omit\n\nother elements of that ground of recovery or defense, and a party has made a request\n\nfor a finding on the omitted elements. In that scenario, the omission is no longer\n\ninadvertent: it is deliberate. Vickery v.

Introduction\n\n      Even if deemed or presumed findings exist in favor of the judgment, there is\n\nstill no evidence of several essential elements for breach of contract, including\n\nconsideration. The plaintiff pled breach of contract instead of conversion to avoid the\n\nstatute of limitations. 1 RR 31 at 4-8. That, of course, is no excuse for failing to meet\n\nthe legal elements.

The “contract,” as described in the findings,\n\nwas “a valid oral contractual agreement via the exchange of mutual promises under\n\nwhich Defendant agreed to find a buy for the park model home.” CR 102. What the\n\nplaintiff described is not an “exchange of mutual promises” because there is no\n\nobligation on her. According to her, Appellant gratuitously offered to sell her trailer\n\nfor her. See 1 RR 17-18. Later in the findings, the contract is described as “the oral\n\n                                          24\n\fcontract to hold such title until a buyer could be find.” CR 103. Again, that does not\n\ndescribe consideration.\n\n       Since there is no evidence on this essential element of the plaintiff’s breach of\n\ncontract claim, a take-nothing judgment must be rendered.\n\nIII.   Indefinite Contract\n\n       A.    Introduction\n\n       Not only is there no consideration to the contract, the entire nature of the\n\ncontract is unclear. The findings refer to the contract as “a valid oral contractual\n\nagreement via the exchange of mutual promises under which Defendant agreed to find\n\na buy for the park model home.” CR 102. They also describe it as “the oral contract\n\nto hold such title until a buyer could be find.” CR 103. What rights and obligations\n\nwere conferred by the contract are unknown.\n\n       B.

For example, in an\n\nagreement to loan money, the material terms include the amount to be loaned,\n\nmaturity date of the loan, the interest rate, and the repayment terms. Id.

Facts\n\n       In this case, the alleged contract is so vague as to be meaningless. The plaintiff\n\nasserted that the trailer was to be held by Appellant until it was sold. 1 RR 18. How\n\nlong was it to be held for? Would Appellant have been liable if the trailer were never\n\nsold? Was she required to use best efforts to procure a buyer? By what terms could\n\nthe trailer have been sold: rent-to-own, cash payment, or periodic payments? None\n\nof these terms are in the record. Even further, there is absolutely no guidance as to\n\nwhat the obligations of the plaintiff would be. Would she be liable to pay Appellant\n\na fee or a portion of the money received for the trailer? Would she have to advise her\n\nthroughout the process? Were there any other duties for her? Were there no duties at\n\nall? Again, it is entirely unclear. As a result, the contract fails for lack of definiteness,\n\nand a take-nothing judgment must be rendered. See T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v.

No Evidence of Breach\n\n      A.     Introduction\n\n      Even if there were an enforceable contract between the parties, due to the lack\n\nof findings on the issue, it would be difficult to determine what the contractual\n\nobligations of the parties were. See supra Parts I & III. According to the findings of\n\nfact, there was “a valid oral contractual agreement via the exchange of mutual\n\npromises under which Defendant agreed to find a buyer for the park model home.”\n\nCR 102. The findings go on regarding breach as follows:\n\n      6.     In May 2010, after the conclusion of litigation in a justice court\n             in Smith County, Texas which had resulted in a judgment\n             unfavorable to Defendant, without the knowledge or consent of\n             the Plaintiff, and without payment of any consideration, the\n             Defendant breached the oral contract to hold such title until a\n             buyer could be found.\n\n      7      In May 2010 the Defendant, unilaterally and without the payment\n             of any consideration for the sale of such park model home,\n             wrongfully affixed her own name to the application for title as\n             Buyer and then remitted the title to the said park model home to\n             the State of Texas further breaching such oral contract and\n             resulting in the issuance of a new certificate of title by the state of\n             Texas reflecting Defendant as owner.\n\nCR 103. There is no dispute that Appellant put her name on the title, but that is not\n\na breach of the plaintiff’s alleged contract. It is also important to note that there are\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\fno findings that the contract was breached by the failure, if any, to send payments\n\nmade for the sale of the home to the plaintiff.\n\n      B.     Law\n\n      Unsurprisingly, breach is an essential element of a breach of contract cause of\n\naction. Valero Mkg. & Supply Co. v. Kalama Int., L.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1579210\"><a href=\"/opinion/1579210/valero-marketing-supply-v-kalama-intern/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.). “When the evidence is undisputed\n\nregarding a person's conduct under a contract, the court as a matter of law determines\n\nwhether the conduct shows performance or breach of a contract obligation.” Id.\n\n      C.     Application\n\n      There is no dispute that Appellant put her name on the title. The issue here is\n\nwhether that is a breach of the plaintiff’s alleged contract. According to the findings,\n\nthe contract required Appellant to find a buyer for the home. CR 103. She did find a\n\nbuyer (at least at one point) and received money from him. 2 RR 57. The plaintiff\n\nwanted to receive money from that arrangement, but the findings did not find a breach\n\nbased on failure to forward payments to her. See CR 102-06. That ground of recovery\n\nhas been waived. Sufficiency of the evidence is measured by the findings of fact: the\n\nquestion here is whether the findings are supported by evidence. Lindner v.

There is no pleading nor a finding that Appellant breached the\n\ncontract by failing to forward payments for the home.\n\n      The only allegation is that Appellant breached the contract by filling in her\n\nname on the title. It is possible that it would be conversion if the trailer were not\n\nreturned after a demand. See Burns v.

But the plaintiff did not sue for conversion\n\ndue to the statute of limitations. 1 RR 31. It is not a breach of contract. The terms of\n\na contract are determined at the time of the original formation. See T.O. Stanley Boot\n\nCo. v.

No Evidence of Attorneys’ Fees\n\n      A.     Introduction\n\n      The court awarded $11,443.67 in attorneys’ fees. CR 105. The only evidence\n\nsupporting that amount is the testimony of the plaintiff’s attorney. He took the case\n\non a forty percent contingency. 2 RR 78 at 13-15. He testified that the going rate for\n\na case like this is $250 per hour. 2 RR 78 at 8-11. He flatly stated that “the amount\n\nof time expended on the case was necessary and reasonable in the representation of\n\nthe client in this case. Totaled at $250 an hour, $12,938.85.” 2 RR 78 at 20-22.\n\nDividing $12,938.85 by $250 to find out the number of hours he spent arrives at\n\n51.7554 hours, which is odd because very few attorneys take note of their time to the\n\nfourth decimal place. 0.0001 of an hour is equal to roughly a third of a second, so that\n\nwould be refreshingly precise timekeeping. It also just so happens that the amount is\n\n                                          35\n\f“equivalent” to his contingency fee if the trailer were worth $33,000, the amount the\n\nplaintiff says she paid for it. 2 RR 79 at 2-5; 2 RR 13 at 9-11. Mr. Hindman did not\n\nexplain how much time he spent, what he spent his time on, the skill required to do\n\nwhatever he did, the novelty or difficulty involved in the case, whether he was\n\nprecluded from other work, time limitations imposed by the client, or his experience\n\nand reputation. See 2 RR 79-80.\n\n      B.     Law\n\n      Although the plaintiff in a breach of contract case does not have to use the\n\nlodestar method to prove up attorneys’ fees, he may elect to do so.

Conclusion\n\n      Mr. Hindman’s testimony lacks the specificity required by the lodestar method\n\nfor calculating attorneys’ fees. It is general and conclusory. He states the amount of\n\ntime spent on the case without providing any means for the court to analyze whether\n\nthe tasks performed were necessary and the time spent on them reasonable. That\n\ninformation must be provided so that the court can determine whether his analysis is\n\ncorrect.\n\n      The remedy for a failure to properly establish attorneys’ fees by the lodestar\n\nmethod is a remand for a determination of the properly-documented amount.

See 2 RR 78-79.\n\nHe testified that he not only filed the case for breach of contract but also for a\n\nDeclaratory Judgment. 2 RR 79 at 14-19. The plaintiff’s petition does not mention the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act. CR 4-9. It does mention trusts and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty, though. CR 5 (title was “left in trust” with Appellant); CR 6 (changing name on\n\ntitle was “in violation [of] Defendant’s fiduciary duty under the oral contract to the\n\nPlaintiff at a time while the Defendant was holding the partially completed title\n\napplication form as a fiduciary”).\n\n      B.

Those fees\n\nwere awarded for prevailing on a breach of contract claim. According to the\n\nplaintiff’s attorney, he presented the claim for breach of contract to Appellant during\n\nthe pendency of this lawsuit. 2 RR 79 at 9-11. He did not say when. See 2 RR 79.\n\n      Presentment is a prerequisite for recovering attorneys’ fees for breach of\n\ncontract. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.002. Obviously, the attorneys’ fees must\n\nhave been incurred after the date of presentment. “The purpose of presentment is to\n\nallow the opposing party a reasonable opportunity to pay a claim without incurring\n\nan obligation for attorney's fees.” Brainard v.

If the attorneys’ fees are incurred before the date of breach and\n\npresentment, they are not recoverable. See id.\n\n      Here, the presentment was made after suit was filed, but no date was provided.\n\nSee 2 RR 79. That makes it impossible to determine what fees were incurred before\n\nor after the date of presentment. The plaintiff’s attorney did not segregate them out\n\n                                          39\n\fhimself. See 2 RR 78-79. He even included $504.82 of court costs in his calculation.\n\n2 RR 78 at 24. Just as it is the attorney’s duty to segregate fees between causes of\n\naction for which they are recoverable and those for which they are not, it was the\n\nplaintiff’s attorney’s duty to segregate fees incurred before the date of presentment\n\nand fees incurred after the date of presentment.
