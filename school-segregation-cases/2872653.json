Gibson\n                ______________________________________\n\n                   Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                               August 22, 2005\n\n\nBefore: NYGAARD, VAN ANTWERPEN AND GREENBERG, CIRCUIT JUDGES\n\n                           (Filed: August 30, 2005 )\n\f                               _______________________\n\n                                      OPINION\n                               _______________________\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n       In February 1999, Robert Spruill filed the underlying pro se civil rights complaint\n\nin the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In his\n\ncomplaint, Spruill alleged that the defendants: (1) violated his due process rights by\n\nconfiscating his personal property; (2) initiated, prosecuted, and adjudicated false\n\ndisciplinary charges against him in retaliation for complaining about prison conditions;\n\nand (3) were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs when he was in segregated\n\nconfinement. On April 2000, the District Court, relying on Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S.\n\n641 (1997), dismissed Spruill’s complaint. While Spruill’s appeal was pending, this\n\nCourt decided Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding that Balisok does\n\nnot require the dismissal of a prisoner’s 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim challenging prison\n\nconditions). Accordingly, in June 2002 this Court reversed the judgment of the District\n\nCourt and remanded the case for further proceedings. See C.A. No. 00-1505.\n\n       Following the 2002 remand, a Magistrate Judge recommended that Spruill’s\n\ncomplaint again be dismissed. On June 14, 2004, over Spruill’s objections, the District\n\nCourt adopted and supplemented the report and recommendation and dismissed Spruill’s\n\ncomplaint. Spruill timely appealed, arguing that the District Court erred in dismissing his\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fretaliation claim.\n\n       On March 11, 2005, a motions panel of this Court declined to dismiss Spruill’s\n\nappeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) and directed the Clerk to issue a briefing\n\nschedule. In their brief on appeal, the appellees concede that Spruill can make out a\n\nprima facie case of retaliation and that a remand is necessary in order for the District\n\nCourt to, inter alia, determine in the first instance whether they “would have made the\n\nsame decision absent the protected conduct for reasons reasonably related to a\n\npenological interest.” Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 333-34 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\nAccordingly, we will vacate the District Court’s June 14, 2004 order and remand the\n\nmatter to the District Court for further proceedings.1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Given this disposition, we need not consider Spruill’s remaining arguments on\nappeal that the District Court erred in: (1) staying discovery while it resolved the legal\nissues presented in the motion to dismiss; and (2) denying his motion for appointment of\ncounsel.\n\n                                              3\n\f",
