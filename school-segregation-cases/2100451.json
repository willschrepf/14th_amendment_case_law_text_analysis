In 2003, Maine enacted a law to\n\nrestrict and regulate the sale and delivery of tobacco products\n\npurchased via the internet or other electronic means.              Several\n\ntrade    associations,    representing    air   and   motor   carriers   of\n\nproperty, brought this action against the Maine Attorney General\n\nalleging that certain provisions of this law are preempted by the\n\nFederal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA).\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment for the associations\n\nand enjoined Maine's Attorney General from enforcing the law.            We\n\naffirm in all respects but one.1\n\n                                   I.\n\n            A.       The FAAAA\n\n            There are two FAAAA preemption provisions at issue in\n\nthis case.       See Pub. L. No. 103-305, § 601; 108 Stat. 1569.         The\n\nfirst provides that a \"State . . . may not enact or enforce a law\n\n. . . related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier .\n\n. . with respect to the transportation of property.\"           49 U.S.C. §\n\n14501(c)(1).       The second states that a \"State may not enact or\n\nenforce a law . . . related to a price, route, or service of an air\n\ncarrier or carrier affiliated with a direct air carrier through\n\ncommon controlling ownership when such carrier is transporting\n\n\n\n     1\n      We are grateful for the amicus curiae briefs filed by several\nstate attorneys general, the American Trucking Association, the\nFederal Express Corporation and the United States Chamber of\nCommerce.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fproperty by aircraft or by motor vehicle . . . .\"                     49 U.S.C. §\n\n41713(b)(4)(A).\n\n            These   provisions        combine    to   bar   states    (subject    to\n\ncertain exceptions discussed later) from enacting laws related to\n\nprices, routes, or services of air or motor carriers of property.\n\nThey are \"intended to function in the exact same manner with\n\nrespect to [their] preemptive effects.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at\n\n85, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1757.\n\n            B.      The Maine Tobacco Delivery Law\n\n            In   2003,   the    Maine    Legislature        adopted   \"An   Act   to\n\nRegulate the Sale of Tobacco Products and to Prevent the Sale of\n\nCigarettes to Minors.\"         See L.D. 1236 (121st Maine Leg.) (codified\n\nat 22 M.R.S.A. §§ 1551, 1555-C & 1555-D) (Tobacco Delivery Law).\n\nThe Tobacco Delivery Law was prompted by the recent increase in\n\ninternet tobacco sales which are consummated by direct delivery to\n\nconsumers   through      the   mail    or   by   commercial     carriers.         See\n\nTestimony of Representative Glen Cummings Before the Joint Standing\n\nCommittee on Health & Human Services (Apr. 29, 2003).                         This\n\nphenomenon has complicated Maine's efforts to regulate \"the sale of\n\ntobacco products to minors\" and caused it to lose \"tremendous tax\n\nrevenues as a result of tax free sales by unlicensed companies.\"\n\nId.   The associations persuaded the district court that §§ 1555-\n\nC(3)(C) & 1555-D are preempted by the FAAAA.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                     1.   § 1555-C(3)(C)\n\n           Maine's Tobacco Delivery Law permits a licensed tobacco\n\nretailer to sell tobacco products2 directly to consumers via the\n\ninternet or other electronic means so long as the retailer takes\n\nspecified steps to ensure that sales are not made to minors.                See\n\nid. §§ 1555-C(2) & (3).     One such step requires the retailer to use\n\na carrier that will ensure that: (1) the purchaser of the tobacco\n\nproducts is the same person as the addressee of the package; (2)\n\nthe addressee is of legal age to purchase tobacco products and sign\n\nfor the package; and (3) if the addressee is under 27 years of age,\n\nthat she show a valid government-issued identification verifying\n\nthat she is old enough to purchase tobacco products.              Id. § 1555-\n\nC(3)(C).   Penalties are imposed only against the retailer for\n\nviolations of this provision.        See id. §§ 1555-C(3)(E)&(F).\n\n                     2.   § 1555-D\n\n           Section    1555-D   makes   it   illegal   for   any    person    to\n\nknowingly deliver tobacco products to a Maine consumer if the\n\nproducts were purchased from an unlicensed retailer.3             The section\n\nalso states that a person delivering a package \"is deemed to know\"\n\n\n\n     2\n      Tobacco products are broadly defined to include \"any form of\ntobacco and any material or device used in the smoking, chewing, or\nother form of tobacco consumption, including cigarette papers and\npipes.\" 22 M.R.S.A. § 1551(3).\n     3\n      It does not, however, bar the delivery of tobacco products\npurchased from an unlicensed retailer to a licensed tobacco\nretailer or distributor operating in Maine. See id.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthat the package contains tobacco products if it (1) so indicates\n\non any side other than the side directly opposite the label, see\n\nCode of Me. R. ch. 203, § 11, or (2) was shipped by a person listed\n\nby the Attorney General as an unlicensed tobacco retailer.4\n\n          C.     The Effect of the Tobacco Delivery Law on United\n                 Parcel Service (UPS)\n\n          As discussed in further detail below, one way for the\n\nassociations to prove that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco\n\nDelivery Law are preempted by the FAAAA is to demonstrate that they\n\nhave a forbidden significant effect on carrier services. See infra\n\nat 25.   The associations have attempted to make this showing by\n\nhighlighting the effect of the challenged provisions on UPS, a\n\nmotor/air carrier of property operating in Maine.5\n\n          UPS, which delivers approximately 65,000 packages per day\n\nin Maine, offers door-to-door delivery service of packages and\n\ndelivery of packages on an express basis.   Its delivery operations\n\nfunction as an integrated system, requiring extensive planning and\n\ncoordination among its operating facilities and ground and air\n\nfleet.   Delays and disruptions in the sorting and delivery of\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The Attorney General maintains a list of unlicensed tobacco\nretailers that he distributes to carriers operating in Maine. 22\nM.R.S.A. § 1555-D (2).\n     5\n      While the associations rely on UPS' experience to prove that\nthe Tobacco Delivery has a forbidden significant effect on\ncarriers, UPS is not a party to this action.\n\n                               -5-\n\fpackages can affect the timely delivery of thousands of packages\n\nwithin the UPS system.\n\n            Prior to the enactment of § 1555-C(3)(C), UPS did not\n\nrequire that its drivers deliver a package only to the addressee,\n\nand it did not require a signature from the recipient of the\n\npackage unless the shipper paid a premium for this additional\n\nservice.    UPS determined that it would not be feasible to alter its\n\ndelivery operations to provide these new services in Maine, so it\n\nstopped delivering all tobacco products to Maine consumers.\n\n            To    make   deliveries       of    tobacco   products     to   licensed\n\nretailers and distributors in Maine as permitted by § 1555-D, UPS\n\nnow   has   modified     its    uniform     package     delivery   procedures    to\n\nidentify packages that contain tobacco products. UPS requires that\n\nits preloaders in Maine (the employees who place the packages on\n\nthe   trucks     for   delivery)     specially        examine   each   package    to\n\ndetermine    if it is marked as containing tobacco or if the name of\n\nthe addressee or shipper indicates that the package likely contains\n\ntobacco.6        Packages      identified       as   likely   containing     tobacco\n\nproducts are then segregated so that UPS employees can research\n\nwhether the package is destined for a licensed tobacco retailer or\n\ndistributor.       If UPS determines that the addressee is not a\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      UPS does not cross-reference packages against the Attorney\nGeneral's list to determine if the shipper is listed as an\nunlicensed tobacco retailer.\n\n                                          -6-\n\flicensed tobacco retailer or distributor, it arranges to return the\n\npackage to the shipper or otherwise to dispose of the package.\n\n            D.      The District Court Decision\n\n            Proceeding from the premise that the FAAAA preempts a\n\nstate law if it \"expressly references\" a carrier's prices, routes,\n\nor services or has a \"forbidden significant effect\" on the same,\n\nthe district court concluded that the challenged provisions of the\n\nTobacco Delivery Law are preempted by the FAAAA. See N.H. Motor\n\nTransp. Ass'n v. Rowe, 377 F. Supp. 2d 197, 210 (D. Me. 2005)\n\n(citing United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza, 318 F.3d 327,\n\n334-35 (1st Cir. 2003) (UPS I)).         The court determined that, while\n\n§ 1555-C(3)(C) did not expressly reference carrier services because\n\nthat section is directed only at retailers of tobacco products, it\n\nhas a forbidden significant effect on UPS because, for the carrier\n\nto accept packages containing tobacco for delivery in Maine, it\n\nwould have to adopt procedures that would \"alter [its] delivery\n\npractices\" for these packages.       Id. at 216.\n\n            The   court   also   ruled   that   §   1555-D   both   expressly\n\nreferences and has a forbidden significant effect on carrier\n\nservices.    It concluded that the provision expressly references\n\nservices because it prohibits carriers from delivering a certain\n\nclass of tobacco products, i.e., tobacco products purchased by\n\nMaine consumers from unlicensed retailers.          See id. at 211-12.     It\n\nalso concluded that the provision also has a forbidden significant\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\feffect because it forced UPS to depart from \"its nationally uniform\n\nprocedure\" by inspecting each package to identify the contents.\n\nId. at 212.     The Attorney General timely appealed from this\n\nruling.7\n\n                                 II.\n\n           A.    Jurisdiction\n\n           Before reaching the merits of the Attorney General's\n\nappeal, we consider two threshold jurisdictional issues.       The\n\nAttorney General asserts that the associations lack standing and\n\nthat the action is moot in light of events occurring subsequent to\n\nthe noticing of the appeal.\n\n                 1.   Standing\n\n           The associations invoke the representational standing\n\ndoctrine recognized by the Supreme Court in Hunt v. Washington\n\nState Apple Adver. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).    Under this\n\ndoctrine, \"an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of\n\nits members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to\n\nsue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are\n\ngermane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim\n\nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of\n\nindividualized members in the lawsuit.\"   Id.\n\n\n     7\n      The district court found that another section of the Tobacco\nDelivery Law, which requires the shipper of tobacco products to\ninform the carrier of the age of the purchaser, was not preempted.\nId. at 217 (citing 22 M.R.S.A. § 1555-C(3)(A)). The associations\nhave not cross-appealed from this ruling.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f               The Attorney General focuses his argument on the third\n\nHunt factor.        He contends that evidence concerning the effect that\n\nthe challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law have on UPS\n\nsuffices only to justify preemption of the challenged provisions as\n\nto UPS. Preemption against other carriers should occur only to the\n\nextent    that      the   other    carriers       individually    prove    that    the\n\nchallenged provisions have a forbidden significant effect on their\n\nprices, routes, or services.\n\n               The district court rejected this argument, observing that\n\n\"[a]ssociational          standing   is   .   .   .   granted    in   cases    seeking\n\ninjunctive relief rather than damages, because individualized proof\n\nis not necessary and the relief usually inures to the benefit of\n\nall members injured.\"             N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n v. Rowe, 324 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 231, 236 (D. Me. 2004).                  Because the associations only\n\nsought    an    injunction     and    a   declaratory     judgment     against     the\n\nchallenged provisions, the court ruled that the third Hunt factor\n\nwas satisfied.        See id. at 236 (citing Playboy              Enters., Inc. v.\n\nPub. Serv. Comm'n of P.R., 906 F.2d 25, 35 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n               After the district court issued this ruling, we clarified\n\nthe requirements for establishing the third Hunt factor.                        In so\n\ndoing, we acknowledged that \"there is no well developed test in\n\nthis circuit as to how the third prong of the Hunt test . . .\n\napplies        in    cases    where       injunctive      relief      is      sought.\"\n\nPharmaceutical Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe, 429 F.3d 294, 313-14 (1st\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fCir. 2005).     But we did not embrace the proposition that, under\n\nPlayboy Enters. the third Hunt factor is always satisfied where an\n\nassociation   seeks   injunctive    relief    on    behalf   of   all   of   its\n\nmembers.    See Rowe, 429 F.3d at 314 (\"Playboy is not an open door\n\nfor association standing in all injunction cases where member\n\ncircumstances    differ   and   proof   of   them   is    important.\").       We\n\nconcluded   that   representational     standing     is    inappropriate      if\n\nadjudicating the merits of an association's claim requires the\n\ncourt to engage in a \"fact-intensive-individual inquiry.\"                    Id.\n\n(quoting Penn. Psychiatric Soc. v. Green Spring Health Servs.,\n\nInc., 280 F.3d 278, 287 (3d Cir. 2002)).             We therefore turn to\n\nwhether the associations' preemption claim requires a sufficiently\n\nfact-intensive inquiry to preclude representational standing.\n\n            The FAAAA provides that a state law is preempted if it\n\nrelates to the prices, routes, or services of \"any motor carrier\"\n\nor \"an air carrier.\"         49 U.S.C. §§ 14501(c) & 41713(b)(4)(A)\n\n(emphases supplied).      \"Any\" means \"one . . . of whatever kind,\" and\n\n\"an\" means \"one.\"     Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary at 40,\n\n53 (10th ed. 2001). The language of the FAAAA accordingly suggests\n\nthat, if a state law is preempted as to one carrier, it is\n\npreempted as to all carriers.8      See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n, 377\n\n\n     8\n      Even if \"an\" as used in § 41713(b)(4)(A)           is ambiguous, \"any\"\nas used in § 14501(c) is clear, and Congress             has emphasized that\nthese provisions were intended to \"function               in the exact same\nmanner.\"    H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 85,                reprinted in 1994\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 1757.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 219.          Such a reading accords with one of the FAAAA's\n\ncentral purposes: to establish a \"level playing field\" among\n\ncarriers.         H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 85, reprinted in 1994\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 1757; see Californians for Safe Dump Truck Transp.\n\nv. Mendonca, 152 F.3d 1184, 1187 (9th Cir. 1998).                 If preemption\n\nwere judged on a carrier-specific basis, the result would be a\n\n\"patchwork\" of state laws applying to some carriers and not to\n\nothers, depending on which carriers proceeded to litigation.                 H.R.\n\nConf. Rep. 103-677 at 87 reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1759.\n\nSuch       a   result   would   undermine     Congress'   goal   of   encouraging\n\nuniformity in carrier regulation.                 Thus, the associations can\n\nprevail by establishing that the challenged provisions of the\n\nTobacco Delivery Law have a forbidden significant effect on one\n\ncarrier.        The district court correctly ruled that the associations\n\nhave standing to press their preemption claim.              See Rowe, 429 F.3d\n\nat 314.9\n\n                        2.      Mootness\n\n                After the district court granted summary judgment, UPS\n\nsettled an enforcement action brought by the New York Attorney\n\n\n       9\n      The Attorney General also argues that representational\nstanding should not be allowed because \"the increased use of\n[representational] standing by large businesses [makes] the defense\nof suits . . . more difficult by controlling discovery and access\nto information.\"     We do not foreclose the possibility that\nrepresentational standing may be improper in a particular case\nbecause of some hardship imposed on a defendant in conducting\ndiscovery.    But the Attorney General has not attempted to\ndemonstrate such a hardship here.\n\n                                           -11-\n\fGeneral under a New York law restricting the ability of carriers to\n\ndeliver cigarettes to consumers.   See N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399 -\n\nll(2) (McKinney 2001).     In that settlement, UPS promised to stop\n\n\"shipping cigarettes to individual consumers in the United States\n\nwhile still permitting lawful shipments of cigarettes to licensed\n\ntobacco businesses.\"     To fulfill this promise, UPS agreed (1) to\n\nidentify all shippers that may be cigarette retailers and advise\n\nthem that UPS will not accept cigarettes for delivery to consumers;\n\n(2) to discipline shippers that violate UPS's non-delivery policy;\n\n(3) to impose measures to ensure that employees \"actively\" look for\n\nindications that a package contains cigarettes; and (4) to instruct\n\ndrivers not to deliver cigarette packages to consumers.\n\n          The Attorney General argues that, as a result of the\n\nsettlement, this appeal has become moot, the judgment should be\n\nvacated and the case should be dismissed.        See Duke Power Co. v.\n\nGreenwood County, 229 U.S. 259, 267 (1936) (stating that where a\n\ncase becomes moot while on appeal, the appellate court must set\n\naside the judgment and remand the case with instructions that it be\n\ndismissed).    He   contends   that,    by   agreeing   not   to   deliver\n\ncigarettes directly to consumers throughout the United States and\n\ndirecting employees actively to look for cigarettes, UPS is no\n\nlonger affected by the Tobacco Delivery Law.\n\n          Article III considerations require that an actual case or\n\ncontroversy exist between the parties throughout the course of\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\flitigation.    See Ramirez v. Sanchez Ramos, 438 F.3d 92, 100 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).    A case must be dismissed as moot \"if, at some time\n\nafter the institution of the action, the parties no longer have a\n\nlegally cognizable stake in the outcome.\" Goodwin v. C.N.J., Inc.,\n\n436 F.3d 44, 46 (1st Cir. 2006).    This rule applies even where the\n\ncase becomes moot while pending on appeal. See Great Western Sugar\n\nCo. v. Nelson, 442 U.S. 92, 93 (1979) (per curiam).            But \"[t]he\n\nburden of establishing mootness rests squarely on the party raising\n\nit, and the burden is a heavy one.\"       Mangual v. Roger-Sabat, 317\n\nF.3d 45, 60 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation omitted).            To establish\n\nmootness, the party raising it must show that the court cannot\n\ngrant any \"effectual relief whatever\" to its opponent.          Church of\n\nScientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992).\n\n          The Attorney General has not met this heavy burden.         The\n\nNew York settlement agreement applies only to the delivery of\n\ncigarettes,    but the Tobacco Delivery Law applies to \"any form of\n\ntobacco and any material or device used in the smoking, chewing or\n\nother form of tobacco consumption.\"       22 M.R.S.A. § 1551-3.       UPS\n\ncould therefore adhere to the terms of the settlement agreement and\n\nnevertheless   violate   the   Tobacco   Delivery   Law   by   unlawfully\n\ndelivering non-cigarette tobacco products.      Because enjoining the\n\nchallenged provisions would permit UPS to deliver all tobacco\n\nproducts, effectual relief remains available.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            B.       Preemption\n\n            We    turn    now    to   the   merits   of   the   district    court's\n\npreemption ruling.        We review the ruling de novo, considering the\n\nrecord and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\n\nthe Attorney General.           See Mullin v. Raytheon Co., 164 F.3d 696,\n\n698 (1st Cir. 1999).        We may affirm on any ground revealed by the\n\nrecord.    See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Houlton, 175 F.3d 178,\n\n183-84 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            The Attorney General presents two arguments for reversal.\n\nFirst, he contends that the FAAAA does not preempt state laws\n\nenacted pursuant to a state's police power to protect the health\n\nand welfare of its citizens. The Attorney General asserts that the\n\nFAAAA preempts only state laws that impose traditional economic\n\nregulation on carriers -- e.g. entry and commodity controls, tariff\n\nfiling requirements, and price ceilings.                   Because the Tobacco\n\nDelivery    Law     does        not   impose    such      traditional       economic\n\nrestrictions, the Attorney General argues that the FAAAA does not\n\napply.    Alternatively, the Attorney General contends that, even if\n\nthe Act applies, neither challenged provision is \"related to\"\n\ncarrier services within the meaning of the FAAAA.\n\n                     1.     Applicability of the FAAAA             to   a   State's\n                            Police-Power Enactments\n\n            A fundamental tenet of our federalist system is that\n\nconstitutionally enacted federal law is supreme to state law.                   See\n\nU.S. Const. Art. VI. cl. 2.             As a result, federal law sometimes\n\n                                        -14-\n\fpreempts state law either expressly or by implication. See Gade v.\n\nNat'l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass'n, 505 U.S. 88, 98 (1992). \"Express\n\npreemption occurs when Congress has unmistakably . . . ordained\n\nthat its enactments alone are to regulate a subject and state laws\n\nregulating      that   subject   must    fall.\"       Mass.    Ass'n    of   Health\n\nMaintenance Organizations v. Ruthardt, 194 F.3d 176, 179 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (citation omitted).        In every preemption case, \"the purpose\n\nof Congress is the ultimate touchstone.\"              Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,\n\n518 U.S. 470, 485 (1996).          The primary focus is on the \"plain\n\nwording\"   of    the   statute   because       the   text   \"contains    the   best\n\nevidence of Congress' pre-emptive intent.\"                  Sprietsma v. Mercury\n\nMarine, 537 U.S. 51, 62 (2002).                But \"[a]lso relevant is the\n\nstructure and purpose of the statute as a whole as revealed . . .\n\nthrough the reviewing court's reasoned understanding of the way in\n\nwhich Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory\n\nscheme to affect business, consumers and the law.\"                Medtronic, 518\n\nU.S. at 486.10\n\n\n     10\n      The parties devote a great deal of argument to whether we\nshould conduct our preemption analysis with a presumption against\npreemption because the state law at issue was enacted to further\nMaine's police-power interest.     See Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator\nCorp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947) (stating that a preemption analysis\nstarts \"with the assumption that the historic police powers of the\nStates were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was\nthe clear and manifest purpose of Congress\"). The circumstances in\nwhich the presumption is to apply are not altogether clear.\nCompare Medtronic, 518 U.S. at 485 (stating that the presumption\nagainst preemption applies \"in all pre-emption cases\") with United\nStates v. Locke, 529 U.S. 89, 108 (2000) (holding the presumption\ninapplicable where \"the State legislates in an area where there has\n\n                                        -15-\n\f              We begin with the text.           As mentioned above, the FAAAA\n\nprohibits states from enacting laws \"related to a price, route, or\n\nservice\" of a carrier.             49 U.S.C. §§ 14501(c) & 41713(b)(4)(A).\n\nThis language was patterned after the preemption provision of the\n\nAirline Deregulation Act of 1978.               See H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at\n\n85, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1757, 1759; Mendonca, 152 F.3d\n\nat 1184; Desardouin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 285 F. Supp. 2d\n\n153,    162   (D.    Conn.   2003).       Therefore,    in    addition   to   cases\n\ninterpreting the FAAAA, we look to cases interpreting the Airline\n\nDeregulation        Act.     UPS    I,   318    F.3d   at    335-36;   Mastercraft\n\nInteriors, Ltd. v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 284 F. Supp. 2d 284, 287\n\n(D. Md. 2003).\n\n              The seminal case is Morales v. Trans World Airlines,\n\nInc., 504 U.S. 374 (1992).               Like the FAAAA, the version of the\n\nAirline Deregulation Act considered in Morales preempted state laws\n\n\"relating to rates, routes or services of any air carrier.\"11                   The\n\n\n\nbeen a history of significant federal presence\"). In any event,\nthe presumption can be overcome where the congressional purpose is\nsufficiently clear. See Egelhoff v. Egelhoff 532 U.S. 141, 151\n(2001). For the reasons discussed infra, we think that the\ncongressional intent to preempt state police-power enactments that\nare related to carrier prices, routes, or services is sufficiently\nclear to overcome any presumption that would apply here.\n\n       11\n      In 1994 Congress replaced \"relating\" with \"related\" and\n\"rates\" with \"price\" but did not intend these revisions to\nsubstantively change the law. See Pub. L. No. 103-272, § 1(a); 108\nStat. 745. This provision is currently codified at 49 U.S.C. §\n41713(b)(1).\n\n                                         -16-\n\fCourt identified \"relating to\" as the key phrase in determining the\n\nbreadth of the preemption provision and concluded that the \"words\n\n. . . express a broad pre-emptive purpose.\"       Id. at 383.   It relied\n\non several cases in which the Court had interpreted a similarly-\n\nworded provision of the Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974\n\n(ERISA) preempting all state laws that \"relate to\" an employee\n\nbenefit plan.    Id. at 384.    The Morales Court emphasized that this\n\nlanguage had an \"expansive sweep\" and that it was \"conspicuous for\n\nits breadth.\"    Id.    In light of Congress' use of similarly broad\n\nlanguage, the Court concluded that Congress intended the Airline\n\nDeregulation Act to preempt any state law that has \"a connection\n\nwith or reference to airline rates, routes, or services.\"           Id.\n\n           The FAAAA's drafters were familiar with Morales and\n\napproved   of   its   reasoning.     The   Conference   Committee   Report\n\nexplains that \"the conferees [did] not intend to alter the broad\n\npreemption interpretation adopted by the United States Supreme\n\nCourt in Morales . . . .\"      H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 83, reprinted\n\nin 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1755.       The sweep of the FAAAA's text and\n\nthe drafters' expressed intent to use Morales as a roadmap are\n\nstrong evidence that the FAAAA was not intended to preempt only a\n\nnarrow class of economic regulations while excluding the many laws\n\nenacted by the states under their police powers.         If Congress had\n\nsuch a limited purpose in mind, it likely would have employed\n\nnarrower language in fashioning the FAAAA preemption provisions.\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fCf. Botz v. Omni Air Int'l, 286 F.3d 488, 493-94 (8th Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"Although Congress could easily have selected more restrictive\n\nterminology to describe the type of . . . enactment the [Airline\n\nDeregulation Act] pre-empts, the provision as written is without\n\nlanguage that would produce a more limited pre-emptive effect.\").\n\n            The Attorney General argues that we should disregard\n\nMorales because, post-Morales, the Supreme Court has narrowed its\n\nunderstanding of ERISA's \"relat[ing] to\" language.            We previously\n\nrejected this identical argument:\n\n            The Secretary argues that the broad preemption\n            standard adopted in Morales has been overruled\n            by   a   number    of  Supreme    Court   cases\n            narrowing the preemptive effect of [ERISA].\n            While the Morales Court undoubtedly took its\n            interpretive cues from the ERISA preemption\n            jurisprudence then in existence, it does not\n            follow that any change in the ERISA law\n            necessitates a parallel change in the law\n            affecting . . . carriers. As Judge Easterbrook\n            has put it:     [I]f developments in pension\n            law    have    under-cut   holdings     in air-\n            transportation    law, it is for the Supreme\n            Court itself to make the adjustments. Our\n            marching orders are clear: follow decisions\n            until the Supreme Court overrules them.\n\nUPS I, 318 F.3d at 335 n.19 (quoting United Airlines, Inc. v. Mesa\n\nAirlines,   Inc.,   219   F.3d   605,   608   (7th   Cir.   2000)).   Absent\n\nextraordinary circumstances not present here, we are not at liberty\n\nto disregard this ruling.        See United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d\n\n1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"We have held, time and again, that in\n\na multi-panel circuit, prior panel decisions are binding upon newly\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fconstituted      panels     in   the    absence   of   supervening     authority\n\nsufficient to warrant disregard of established precedent.\").\n\n           We look also to the FAAAA's structure and legislative\n\nhistory.   The FAAAA includes a series of exceptions to the general\n\npreemption rule.       The excepted areas are:\n\n           the   safety   regulatory     authority   of   a\n           State   with   respect    to   motor   vehicles,\n           the   authority   of    a    State   to   impose\n           highway route controls or limitations based on\n           the size or weight of the motor vehicle or the\n           hazardous nature of the cargo, or the authority\n           of a State to regulate motor carriers with\n           regard to minimum amounts of financial\n           responsibility     relating      to    insurance\n           requirements and self-insurance authorization.\n\n49 U.S.C. §§ 14501(c)(2) & 41713(b)(4)(B)(i).             The Attorney General\n\nacknowledges that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery\n\nLaw do not fall within any of these exceptions.                  He contends,\n\nhowever,       that    these     statutory     exceptions    suggest    broader\n\ncongressional purpose to permit states to regulate carriers to\n\nprotect citizen health and safety.             The Attorney General points to\n\na passage from the FAAAA's legislative history indicating that the\n\nenumerated exceptions were \"not intended to be all inclusive,\" H.R.\n\nConf. Rep. 103-677 at 84, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1756, to\n\nargue   that    we    may   establish   an   additional   exception    to   FAAAA\n\npreemption for laws enacted pursuant to a state's police power to\n\nprotect the health and welfare of its citizens.\n\n           We have cautioned that an overly broad interpretation of\n\nthe FAAAA exceptions \"would swallow the rule of preemption.\" United\n\n                                        -19-\n\fParcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza, 385 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(UPS II).      An exclusion from preemption for police-power enactments\n\nwould surely \"swallow the rule of preemption,\" as most state laws\n\nare enacted pursuant to this authority.                   Id.     The exceptions\n\npreserving the states' authority to regulate motor vehicles do not\n\nsupport the Attorney General's argument.                 See id. (rejecting an\n\nargument       that    the   FAAAA    preemption       exceptions     indicate     a\n\ncongressional intent to preserve state authority over safety issues\n\ngenerally).\n\n               While   the   statute's    structure     does    not   support    the\n\nAttorney General's police-power argument, there is some support in\n\nthe legislative history for his view that the FAAAA preempts only\n\nstate economic regulation. The Conference Committee Report observed\n\nthat \"[s]tate economic regulation of motor carriers . . . is a huge\n\nproblem for national and regional carriers attempting to conduct a\n\nstandard way of doing business.\"           H.R.

The conferees identified\n\n\"typical forms\" of harmful regulation to include \"entry controls,\n\ntariff filing, price regulation,\" and regulation of the \"types of\n\ncommodities carried.\"         Id. at 1758.       This history led the Supreme\n\nCourt to remark that \"the problem to which the [FAAAA] congressional\n\nconferees attended was state economic regulation.\" Columbus v. Ours\n\nGarage     &    Wreckers     Serv.,   536       U.S.   424,     440   (2002).\n\n               This history, however, does not indicate that preempting\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\feconomic regulation was the FAAAA's only purpose.                      And, in any\n\nevent,    the legislative history cannot trump the statute's text.\n\nSee Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 521 (1992)\n\n(declining     to     adopt    a    limited   interpretation      of   a   preemption\n\nprovision suggested by legislative history because \"the language of\n\nthe [cigarette labeling] Act plainly reaches\" further); Morales, 504\n\nU.S. at 385 n.2 (The \"legislative history need not confirm the\n\ndetails of changes in the law effected by statutory language before\n\nwe will interpret that language according to its natural meaning.\").\n\nCongress often acts to address a specific problem but ultimately\n\nsettles on a broader remedy.               See Penn. Dep't of Corr. v.

It demonstrates breadth.\").\n\n              In addition, the legislative history reveals a second goal\n\nfor FAAAA preemption which is inconsistent with the Attorney's\n\nGeneral argument: \"to create a completely level playing field\n\nbetween air carriers . . . on the one hand and motor carriers on the\n\nother.\"       H.R.

In other words, the conferees intended the\n\nscope    of   FAAAA    and    Airline     Deregulation    Act    preemption       to    be\n\ncoterminous.        See Ace Auto Body & Towing Ltd. v. City of New York,\n\n171 F.3d 765, 772 (2d Cir. 1999); Mendonca, 152 F.3d at 1187.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -21-\n\f           In the Airline Deregulation Act context, the Supreme Court\n\nhas   focused     on    the   effect   that      a   state   law   has    on   carrier\n\noperations, not on the state's purpose for enacting the law.                         In\n\nMorales, the Court found that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted\n\na directive promulgated by several state attorneys general informing\n\nairlines that certain advertising practices would be considered to\n\nviolate state consumer-protection laws.                504 U.S. at 379.        And, in\n\nAmerican Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U.S. 219, 227-28 (1995), the\n\nCourt held that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted a cause of\n\naction   under     the    Illinois     Consumer      Fraud   Act    concerning      the\n\nredemption of frequent-flier miles.                  In both cases, the Court's\n\npreemption analysis centered on the impact that the challenged state\n\nlaws had on airline services and rates and not on the fact that the\n\npreempted laws were enacted pursuant to the states' police power to\n\ncombat consumer fraud.           See Fla. Lime & Avocado Growers v. Paul,\n\n373 U.S. 132, 150 (1973) (describing the traditional state authority\n\nto pass laws to combat consumer fraud).                  The Court reached these\n\nconclusions over dissents by Justice Stevens arguing (similarly to\n\nthe Attorney General here) that the state laws at issue should not\n\nbe    preempted        because    there     was      insufficient        evidence    of\n\ncongressional intent to preempt state police-power enactments.                      See\n\nAm. Airlines, 513 U.S. at 235-31 (Steven, J. dissenting in part);\n\nMorales, 504 U.S. at 419-27 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\f                   Morales and American Airlines thus teach that, under the\n\nAirline Deregulation Act, the focus should be on the effect that the\n\nstate        law    has    on    airline     operations.            Accepting          the    Attorney\n\nGeneral's argument would shift the analysis under the FAAAA away\n\nfrom that state law's effect and towards the state's purpose for\n\nenacting the law.               A purpose-related limitation on FAAAA preemption\n\nwould thus inevitably create a gap between the scope of FAAAA and\n\nAirline        Deregulation         Act    preemption         --    a    gap    which    the     FAAAA\n\ndrafters sought to avoid.\n\n                   In the end, the Attorney General's argument founders\n\nbecause it cannot be reconciled with the FAAAA's text.                                       The Act's\n\ndrafters chose to express the preemptive scope of the FAAAA in words\n\nthat they understood to be exceedingly broad.                                  In the preemption\n\ncontext, we are to give effect to the ordinary meaning                                           of a\n\ncongressional enactment \"unless there is good reason to believe that\n\nCongress           intended      the   language        to    have       some    more    restrictive\n\nmeaning.\"            Cipollone,        505      U.S.    at    521.         We    do    not     find   a\n\nsufficiently compelling basis in either the structure or history of\n\nthe   FAAAA         to    interpret       the   Act     contrary         to    its    \"deliberately\n\nexpansive text.\"                Morales, 504 U.S. at 384.                We therefore conclude\n\nthat the FAAAA preempts state police-power enactments to the extent\n\nthat they are \"related to\" a carrier's prices, routes, or services.12\n\n\n        12\n      The Attorney General offers a narrower argument for excluding\nfrom FAAAA preemption state laws intended to address underage\nsmoking. He cites the Synar Amendment, a federal law conditioning\n\n                                                 -23-\n\f                    2. FAAAA Preemption of the Tobacco Delivery Law\n\n          We turn now to whether the challenged provisions of the\n\nTobacco Delivery Law are preempted because they are \"related to\"\n\ncarrier services.    The parties do not contest that carriers provide\n\nthe service of delivering \"packages on an express or time-guaranteed\n\nbasis.\"   See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 209\n\n(quoting UPS I, 318 F.3d at 336).      But they disagree over whether\n\nthe challenged provisions are \"related to\" this service.\n\n          We have previously interpreted the phrase \"related to\" as\n\nused in the FAAAA:\n\n          The phrase \"related to\" has a broad meaning in\n          ordinary usage: to stand in some relation; to\n          have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to\n          bring in association or connection with. When\n          used in a preemption provision, such as\n          [in the FAAAA], it has a similarly broad reach.\n          State laws and regulations having a connection\n          with or reference to a . . . carrier's . . .\n          services are preempted under the [FAAAA]. A\n          sufficient nexus exists if the law expressly\n          references the . . . carriers' . . . services\n\n\n\nthe states' receipt of certain federal funds on their enacting laws\nto ban the sale of tobacco products to minors. See 42 U.S.C. §\n300x-26. The Attorney General contends that the Synar Amendment\ndemonstrates Congress' intent that the states be able to regulate\nthe delivery of tobacco products irrespective of the FAAAA. We\ndisagree. The Synar Amendment indicates Congress' intent that the\nstates take the lead in addressing the underage smoking problem.\nBut the Attorney General has not identified any evidence that\nCongress intended the states do so in derogation of other federal\nlaws. The FAAAA and Synar Amendment can exist harmoniously because\nthe states may pass laws to curb underage smoking without passing\nlaws \"related to\" carrier prices, routes, or services. See UPS I,\n318 F.3d at 333-34 (stating that courts should endeavor to read\ncongressional enactments in harmony whenever possible).\n\n                            -24-\n\f            or has a forbidden significant effect on the\n            same.\n\n\nUPS I, 318 F.3d at 335.       We therefore consider whether the district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that the challenged provisions of the\n\nTobacco Delivery Law either expressly reference carrier services or\n\nhave a forbidden significant effect on UPS' services.\n\n            We begin with § 1555-C(3)(C).       As set forth above, this\n\nstatute requires tobacco retailers seeking to ship tobacco products\n\ndirectly to Maine consumers to use only carriers that deliver the\n\npackage directly to the addressee/purchaser, require a signature\n\nfrom the addressee/purchaser, and conduct age verification if the\n\naddressee/purchaser is under 27 years of age.              Another section\n\npenalizes retailers that use carriers that do not provide these\n\nservices.   22 M.R.S.A. §§ 1555-C(3)(E)&(F).\n\n            Section 1555-C(3)(C) expressly references a carrier's\n\nservice of providing the timely delivery of packages.          The statute\n\nprescribes the method by which a carrier operating in Maine must\n\ndeliver packages containing tobacco products in a way that would\n\naffect   the   ability   of    the   carrier   to   meet   package-delivery\n\ndeadlines. Delays in searching for the purchaser, making multiple\n\ndelivery attempts if the purchaser cannot be located, obtaining the\n\npurchaser's signature, and verifying the purchaser's age all could\n\naffect timely deliveries.       See UPS I, 318 F.3d at 336 (finding that\n\nthe FAAAA preempted a state law that \"affect[ed] the timeliness and\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\feffectiveness\"     of   a carrier's    service).\n\n            The Attorney General responds that there is no FAAAA\n\npreemption because § 1555-C(3)(C) regulates retailers of tobacco\n\nproducts and not carriers.       He also argues that we should decline to\n\nfind preemption because any carrier can avoid the requirements of §\n\n1555-C(3)(C) by declining to provide tobacco-product deliveries to\n\nMaine consumers.\n\n            The Attorney General's first argument amounts to a claim\n\nthat there can be no FAAAA preemption unless the state law imposes\n\na direct regulation on carriers.         This argument cannot be squared\n\nwith the FAAAA's text because it reads the broad phrase \"related to\"\n\nout   of   the   statute   and   replaces    it   with    the   narrower   term\n\n\"regulates.\"     See Morales, 504 U.S. at 385 (rejecting an argument\n\nthat would have read \"relating to\" out of the Airline Deregulation\n\nAct and replaced it with \"regulate\"); UPS I, 318 F.3d at 335\n\n(rejecting an argument for narrowing scope of the FAAAA that \"would\n\nread 'the related to language' out of the statute\").\n\n            Moreover, limiting preemption to direct regulation of\n\ncarriers is inconsistent with the FAAAA's purpose to bar states from\n\npolicing carrier operations.       See Am. Airlines, 513 U.S. at 228.        A\n\nstate may use its coercive power to cause carriers to conform to\n\nstate-imposed rules in at least two ways: it may directly regulate\n\ncarriers or it may limit retailers to hiring only those carriers\n\nthat comply with the state-imposed mandates.             Either way the state\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fis employing its coercive power to police the method by which\n\ncarriers provide services in the state.          In short, the Attorney\n\nGeneral's argument would lead to the untenable result of permitting\n\nstates   to    regulate   carrier   services   indirectly   by    regulating\n\nshippers.      Cf. Abington Sch. Dist. v. Schemp, 374 U.S. 203, 230\n\n(1963) (declining to adopt an interpretation that would permit\n\nstates to do indirectly what they cannot do directly).\n\n              The Attorney General's alternative argument -- that there\n\nis no preemption because a carrier can forgo certain tobacco-product\n\ndeliveries in Maine -- also fails.         Declining to find preemption\n\nsimply because a carrier can limit its in-state business to avoid a\n\nparticular requirement would undermine the FAAAA's goal of creating\n\nan environment in which \"[s]ervice options will be dictated by the\n\nmarketplace,\" and not by state regulatory regimes.          H.R. Conf. Rep.\n\n103-677 at 88, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1760.           The district\n\ncourt correctly concluded that the FAAAA preempts § 1555-C(3)(C).\n\n              We turn finally to whether the FAAAA preempts § 1555-D.\n\nIn considering this question, we are mindful that courts should \"not\n\nnullify more of a legislature's work than is necessary, for . . .\n\na   ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the\n\nelected representative of the people.\" Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood\n\nof N. New England, 126 S. Ct. 961, 967 (2006) (internal citation\n\nomitted).      The first part of §1555-D makes it unlawful for any\n\nperson knowingly to deliver to Maine consumers certain contraband\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\ftobacco products -- i.e., those tobacco products purchased by\n\nconsumers from unlicensed retailers.            The second part of § 1555-D\n\ncharges a carrier with knowledge that a package contains tobacco\n\nproducts if the package is so marked or if the shipper appears on\n\nthe Attorney General's list of unlicensed tobacco retailers.\n\n           Under Maine law, tobacco products purchased by a consumer\n\nfrom an unlicensed retailer are contraband.             See 22 M.R.S.A. § 1555-\n\nC(7).   The first part of § 1555-D is a corollary to § 1555-C(7) in\n\nthat it makes the knowing delivery of contraband tobacco products\n\nillegal.     Thus,    the   question    we    face    is   whether     a    generally\n\napplicable   law     barring   any     person   from       knowingly       delivering\n\ncontraband tobacco is preempted by the FAAAA insofar as the law\n\npertains to carriers.\n\n           While the FAAAA's preemptive effect is broad, see UPS I,\n\n318 F.3d at 335, it is not unlimited, see Mendonca, 152 F.3d at\n\n1188.   State laws that only have a \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\"\n\nrelation to services are beyond the FAAAA's reach.                   Morales, 504\n\nU.S. at 390; Mendonca, 152 F.3d at 1188.                    In describing this\n\nlimitation on preemption in the Airline Deregulation Act context,\n\nthe Supreme Court explained that its broad interpretation of the\n\nstatute's preemption provision did not place it \"on a road that\n\nleads to pre-emption of gambling and prostitution as applied to\n\nairlines.\"   Morales, 504 U.S. at 390.               We understand the Morales\n\nCourt to have meant that states may continue to enjoy the power to\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fban primary conduct, and that the ADA and FAAAA do not preempt laws\n\napplying these prohibitions to airlines and carriers.\n\n            Accordingly, Morales suggests that § 1555-D's ban on the\n\nknowing delivery of contraband tobacco products is not preempted by\n\nthe FAAAA -- even only insofar as it pertains to carrier services.\n\nSection    1555-D     requires     that    carriers   do   not   act     as    knowing\n\naccomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products.                   It does not,\n\nhowever, require that carriers modify their delivery methods other\n\nthan by declining to transport a product that Maine has legitimately\n\nbanned.     We think that this effect on services is \"too tenuous\" to\n\nwarrant preemption.         Mendonca, 152 F.3d at 1189 (stating that a\n\nstate law is too tenuous to be preempted by the FAAAA where the law\n\ndoes not frustrate the FAAAA's deregulatory purposes).\n\n            If the rule were otherwise, states would be unable to bar\n\na primary method by which contraband crosses state lines.                     We do not\n\nbelieve that this was Congress' intent in enacting the FAAAA.                      Other\n\ncourts    applying    the   FAAAA    to    prohibitions    on    the    delivery      of\n\ncontraband tobacco have reached similar conclusions.                   See Robertson\n\nv. Liquor Control Bd., 10 P.3d 1079, 1084-85 (Wash. App. Ct. 2000)\n\n(concluding that the FAAAA did not preempt a state law banning the\n\ntransport    of     contraband     cigarettes    because   otherwise          \"a   motor\n\ncarrier     would    be   exempt    from    forfeiture     for    transporting         a\n\nmethamphetamine lab or poached game\"); see also N.Y.

Aug. 19, 2003) (concluding that the FAAAA did not preempt\n\na state law making it unlawful for carriers to deliver cigarettes\n\ndirectly to New York consumers because                    \"the mere fact that a\n\nstatute concerns the transportation of a particular cargo by                    . . .\n\ncarriers . . . does not render it                     . . . unconstitutional on\n\npreemption grounds\"); Ward v. New York, 291 F. Supp. 2d 188, 210-211\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (similar).13\n\n                But,     while   Maine    may   ban   a   carrier   from   knowingly\n\ntransporting contraband tobacco products, it may not dictate the\n\nprocedures that a carrier should employ to locate these products in\n\nits delivery chain.           See UPS I, 318 F.3d at 336 (concluding that the\n\nFAAAA        preempted    a   Puerto     Rico   revenue-collection     scheme   that\n\nmandated procedures that carriers had to follow to deliver certain\n\npackages).        The second part of § 1555-D violates this principle.\n\n                As noted, § 1555-D imposes upon a carrier constructive\n\n\n        13\n      There are many state laws barring the transport and delivery\nof contraband.   E.g., Ala. Code § 2-14-5 (barring transport of\ncertain products related to bee keeping); Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 3-209\n(barring the transport of quarantined produce); Ariz. Rev. Stat. §\n13-3102 (barring transport of prohibited weapons); Cal. Bus. &\nProf. Code § 17533.9 (barring transport of tear gas); Cal. Fish &\nGame Code § 4800 (barring the transport of mountain lions); N.Y.\nPenal Law § 190.50 (barring transport of slot machines or other\ngambling devices). We have not a found a single case, outside the\ntobacco context, in which bans on the transport of contraband have\nbeen challenged as preempted by the FAAAA. Cf. Sir Arthur Conan\nDoyle, Silver Blaze (1890) (William S. Baring-Gould, ed., The\nAnnotated Sherlock Holmes, Vol. II, 1967) (Detective Gregory: \"'Is\nthere any other point to which you would wish to draw my\nattention?\" Sherlock Holmes: \"To the curious incident of the dog in\nthe night-time.\" Gregory: \"The dog did nothing in the night-time.\"\nHolmes: \"That was the curious incident.\").\n\n                                           -30-\n\fknowledge that it has delivered a tobacco product if the package\n\ncontaining the product is marked as containing tobacco or if the\n\nseller's name appears on the Attorney General's list.                    As UPS'\n\nexperience demonstrates, a carrier seeking to comply with § 1555-D\n\nmust specially inspect every package destined for delivery in Maine.\n\nOnce the carrier has finished this inspection, it must segregate the\n\npackages that contain tobacco and research whether the addressee is\n\na   Maine-licensed    retailer    or    distributor      who   can   receive   the\n\npackage.    While the second part of § 1555-D does not expressly\n\nreference carrier services, it \"impermissibly affect[s] . . .\n\nservices . . . because it requir[es] UPS to identify the contents of\n\nthe   packages   (a   deviation    from       standard    procedures    used    in\n\ndeliveries elsewhere in the United States). . . .\"             UPS II, 385 F.2d\n\nat 14 (parenthesis in original).               UPS can only provide timely\n\npackage delivery if it follows uniform procedures that allow for \"an\n\norderly flow of packages.\"        UPS I, 318 F.3d at 336.            Because the\n\nsecond part of § 1555-D has the effect of forcing UPS to change its\n\nuniform package-processing procedures, the district court correctly\n\nfound it to be preempted.14\n\n\n      14\n      The Attorney General argues that the associations have failed\nto establish a forbidden significant effect on UPS because they did\nnot offer studies conducted by UPS on the cost of compliance. We\nagree with the district court that there is no such quantification\nrequirement. The cases in this area have looked to the logical\neffect that a particular scheme has on the delivery of services or\nthe setting of rates and have not required the presentation of\nempirical evidence. See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n, 377 F. Supp. 2d\nat 217 n. 92 (collecting cases).\n\n                                       -31-\n\f            In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that there is a\n\npotential tension between saying that, on the one hand, Maine is\n\nfree   to   punish   the   knowing   delivery    of   material    that   it   has\n\nclassified as contraband, while, on the other hand, ruling that it\n\nmay not dictate or interfere with a carrier's delivery procedures.\n\nWhat we are saying here, however, is that Maine cannot use the\n\nmechanisms outlined in the statute to impute knowledge based on a\n\nfailure to read labels or consult lists --              an imputation which\n\nwould amount to prescribing how carriers must operate.\n\n            If, however, Maine could prove that a carrier employee had\n\nactual knowledge that a package being delivered was contraband\n\ntobacco, then it might have a colorable enforcement case -- although\n\nsuch circumstances, as a practical matter, may be difficult to\n\nprove.   True, the \"related to\" language could stretch to such a case\n\nbut it could also stretch to the knowing delivery of hard drugs --\n\nand Congress cannot have intended such a result.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            \"[T]obacco     use,      particularly     among      children     and\n\nadolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant public health\n\nproblem in the United States.\"         FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco\n\nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 161 (2000).          There is no question that Maine\n\nhas sought to achieve a worthy objective by passing the Tobacco\n\nDelivery Law to combat this pernicious problem.               See N.H. Motor\n\nTransp. Ass'n, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 219.          But the FAAAA focuses on the\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\feffect that a state's law has on carriers, and not on the state's\n\nobjective in passing the law.       To the extent that Maine's Tobacco\n\nDelivery Law requires (or has the effect of requiring) carriers to\n\nimplement state-mandated procedures in the processing and delivery\n\nof packages, it is preempted by the FAAAA.        But to the extent that\n\nthe   Tobacco   Delivery   Law   merely   bars   all   persons   (including\n\ncarriers) from knowingly transporting contraband tobacco into Maine,\n\nthe FAAAA is not implicated.\n\n           We affirm the judgment as it pertains to 22 M.R.S.A. §\n\n1555-C(3)(C) and the second part of 22 M.R.S.A. § 1555-D but reverse\n\nthe judgment as it pertains to the first part of § 1555-D.

Several trade associations, representing air and motor carriers of property, brought this action against the Maine Attorney General alleging that certain provisions of this law are preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA). The district court granted summary judgment for the associations and enjoined Maine's Attorney General from enforcing the law. We affirm in all respects but one.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The FAAAA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two FAAAA preemption provisions at issue in this case. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 103-305, &#167; 601; 108 Stat. 1569. The first provides that a \"State ... may not enact or enforce a law ... related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 14501(c)(1). The second states that a \"State may not enact or enforce a law . . . related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier or carrier affiliated with a direct air carrier through common controlling ownership when such carrier is transporting property by aircraft or by motor vehicle ....\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 41713(b)(4)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These provisions combine to bar states (subject to certain exceptions discussed later) from enacting laws related to prices, routes, or services of air or motor carriers of property.

(codified at 22 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 1551, 1555-C &amp; 1555-D) (Tobacco Delivery Law). The Tobacco Delivery Law was prompted by the recent increase in internet tobacco sales which are consummated by direct delivery to consumers through the mail or by commercial carriers. <i>See</i> Testimony of Representative Glen Cummings Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health &amp; Human Services (Apr. 29, 2003). This phenomenon has complicated Maine's efforts to regulate \"the sale of tobacco products to minors\" and caused it to lose \"tremendous tax revenues as a result of tax free sales by unlicensed companies.\" <i>Id.</i> The associations persuaded the district court that &#167;&#167; 1555-C(3)(C) &amp; 1555-D are preempted by the FAAAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. &#167; 1555-C(3)(C)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's Tobacco Delivery Law permits a licensed tobacco retailer to sell tobacco products<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> directly to consumers via the internet or other electronic means so long as the retailer takes specified steps to ensure that sales are not made to minors. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1555-C(2) &amp; (3). One such step requires the retailer to use a carrier that will ensure that: (1) the purchaser of the tobacco products is the same person as the addressee of the package; (2) the addressee is of legal age to purchase tobacco products and sign for the package; and (3) if the addressee is under 27 years of age, that she show a valid government-issued identification verifying that she is old enough to purchase tobacco products. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1555-C(3)(C). Penalties are imposed only against the retailer for violations of this provision. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1555-C(3)(E) &amp; (F).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. &#167; 1555-D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1555-D makes it illegal for any person to knowingly deliver tobacco products to a Maine consumer if the products were purchased from an unlicensed retailer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The section also states that a person delivering a package \"is deemed to know\" that the package contains tobacco products if it (1) so indicates on any side other than the side directly opposite the label, <i>see</i> Code of Me. R. ch. 203, &#167; 11, or (2) was shipped by a person listed by the Attorney General as an unlicensed tobacco retailer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Effect of the Tobacco Delivery Law on United Parcel Service (UPS)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed in further detail below, one way for the associations to prove that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law are preempted by the FAAAA is to demonstrate that they have a forbidden significant effect on carrier services. <i>See infra</i> at 25. The associations have attempted to make this showing by highlighting the effect of the challenged provisions on UPS, a motor/air carrier of property operating in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS, which delivers approximately 65,000 packages per day in Maine, offers door-to-door delivery service of packages and delivery of packages on an express basis. Its delivery operations function as an integrated system, requiring extensive planning and coordination among its operating facilities and ground and air fleet. Delays and disruptions in the sorting and delivery of packages can affect the timely delivery of thousands of packages within the UPS system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the enactment of &#167; 1555-C(3)(C), UPS did not require that its drivers deliver a package only to the addressee, and it did not require a signature from the recipient of the package unless the shipper paid a premium for this additional service. UPS determined that it would not be feasible to alter its delivery operations to provide these new services in Maine, so it stopped delivering all tobacco products to Maine consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make deliveries of tobacco products to licensed retailers and distributors in Maine as permitted by &#167; 1555-D, UPS now has modified its uniform package delivery procedures to identify packages that contain tobacco products. UPS requires that its preloaders in Maine (the employees who place the packages on the trucks for delivery) specially examine each package to determine if it is marked as containing tobacco or if the name of the addressee or shipper indicates that the package likely contains tobacco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Packages identified as likely containing tobacco products are then segregated so that UPS employees can research whether the package is destined for a licensed tobacco retailer or distributor. If UPS determines that the addressee is not a licensed tobacco retailer or distributor, it arranges to return the package to the shipper or otherwise to dispose of the package.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The District Court Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding from the premise that the FAAAA preempts a state law if it \"expressly references\" a carrier's prices, routes, or services or has a \"forbidden significant effect\" on the same, the district court concluded that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law are preempted by the FAAAA. <i>See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n v. Rowe,</i> 377 F.Supp.2d 197, 210 (D.Me.2005) (citing <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 318 F.3d 323, 334-35 (1st Cir.2003) (<i>UPS I</i>)). The court determined that, while &#167; 1555-C(3)(C) did not expressly reference carrier services because that section is directed only at retailers of tobacco products, it has a forbidden significant effect on UPS because, for the carrier to accept packages containing tobacco for delivery in Maine, it would have to adopt procedures that would \"alter [its] delivery practices\" for these packages. <i>Id.</i> at 216.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also ruled that &#167; 1555-D both expressly references and has a forbidden significant effect on carrier services. It concluded that the provision expressly references services because it prohibits carriers from delivering a certain class of tobacco products, i.e., tobacco products purchased by Maine consumers from unlicensed retailers. <i>See id.</i> at 211-12. It also concluded that the provision also has a forbidden significant effect because it forced UPS to depart from \"its nationally uniform procedure\" by inspecting each package to identify the contents. <i>Id.</i> at 212. The Attorney General timely appealed from this ruling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before reaching the merits of the Attorney General's appeal, we consider two threshold jurisdictional issues. The Attorney General asserts that the associations lack standing and that the action is moot in light of events occurring subsequent to the noticing of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The associations invoke the representational standing doctrine recognized by the Supreme Court in <i>Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver. Comm'n,</i> 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). Under this doctrine, \"an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individualized members in the lawsuit.\" <i>Id.</i> The Attorney General focuses his argument on the third <i>Hunt</i> factor. He contends that evidence concerning the effect that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law have on UPS suffices only to justify preemption of the challenged provisions as to UPS. Preemption against other carriers should occur only to the extent that the other carriers individually prove that the challenged provisions have a forbidden significant effect on their prices, routes, or services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this argument, observing that \"[a]ssociational standing is ... granted in cases seeking injunctive relief rather than damages, because individualized proof is not necessary and the relief usually inures to the benefit of all members injured.\" <i>N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n v. Rowe,</i> 324 F.Supp.2d 231, 236 (D.Me.2004). Because the associations only sought an injunction and a declaratory judgment against the challenged provisions, the court ruled that the third <i>Hunt</i> factor was satisfied. <i>See id.</i> at 236 (citing <i>Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of P.R.,</i> 906 F.2d 25, 35 (1st Cir. 1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court issued this ruling, we clarified the requirements for establishing the third <i>Hunt</i> factor. In so doing, we acknowledged that \"there is no well developed test in this circuit as to how the third prong of the <i>Hunt</i> test . . . applies in cases where injunctive relief is sought.\" <i>Pharmaceutical Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe,</i> 429 F.3d 294, 313-14 (1st Cir.2005). But we did not embrace the proposition that, under <i>Playboy Enters.</i> the third <i>Hunt</i> factor is always satisfied where an association seeks injunctive relief on behalf of all of its members. <i>See Rowe,</i> 429 F.3d at 314 (\"<i>Playboy</i> is not an open door for association standing in all injunction cases where member circumstances differ and proof of them is important.\"). We concluded that representational standing is inappropriate if adjudicating the merits of an association's claim requires the court to engage in a \"fact-intensive-individual inquiry.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Penn. Psychiatric Soc. v. Green Spring Health Servs., Inc.,</i> 280 F.3d 278, 287 (3d Cir. 2002)). We therefore turn to whether the associations' preemption claim requires a sufficiently fact-intensive inquiry to preclude representational standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAAAA provides that a state law is preempted if it relates to the prices, routes, or services of \"<i>any</i> motor carrier\" or \"<i>an</i> air carrier.\" 49 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 14501(c) &amp; 41713(b)(4)(A) (emphases supplied). \"Any\" means \"one ... of whatever kind,\" and \"an\" means \"one.\" <i>Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</i> at 40, 53 (10th ed.2001). The language of the FAAAA accordingly suggests that, if a state law is preempted as to one carrier, it is preempted as to all carriers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n,</i> 377 F.Supp.2d at 219. Such a reading accords with one of the FAAAA's central purposes: to establish a \"level playing field\" among carriers. H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 85, <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1757; <i>see Californians for Safe Dump Truck Transp. v. Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d 1184, 1187 (9th Cir.1998). If preemption were judged on a carrier-specific basis, the result would be a \"patchwork\" of state laws applying to some carriers and not to others, depending on which carriers proceeded to litigation. H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 87 <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1759. Such a result would undermine Congress' goal of encouraging uniformity in carrier regulation. Thus, the associations can prevail by establishing that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law have a forbidden significant effect on one carrier. The district court correctly ruled that the associations have standing to press their preemption claim. <i>See Rowe,</i> 429 F.3d at 314.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Mootness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court granted summary judgment, UPS settled an enforcement action brought by the New York Attorney General under a New York law restricting the ability of carriers to deliver cigarettes to consumers. <i>See</i> N.Y. Pub. Health Law &#167; 1399-ll(2) (McKinney 2001). In that settlement, UPS promised to stop \"shipping cigarettes to individual consumers in the United States while still permitting lawful shipments of cigarettes to licensed tobacco businesses.\" To fulfill this promise, UPS agreed (1) to identify all shippers that may be cigarette retailers and advise them that UPS will not accept cigarettes for delivery to consumers; (2) to discipline shippers that violate UPS's non-delivery policy; (3) to impose measures to ensure that employees \"actively\" look for indications that a package contains cigarettes; and (4) to instruct drivers not to deliver cigarette packages to consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General argues that, as a result of the settlement, this appeal has become moot, the judgment should be vacated and the case should be dismissed. <i>See Duke Power Co. v. Greenwood County,</i> 299 U.S. 259, 267, 57 S.Ct. 202, 81 L.Ed. 178 (1936) (stating that where a case becomes moot while on appeal, the appellate court must set aside the judgment and remand the case with instructions that it be dismissed). He contends that, by agreeing not to deliver cigarettes directly to consumers throughout the United States and directing employees actively to look for cigarettes, UPS is no longer affected by the Tobacco Delivery Law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article III considerations require that an actual case or controversy exist between the parties throughout the course of litigation. <i>See Ramirez v. Sanchez Ramos,</i> 438 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir.2006). A case must be dismissed as moot \"if, at some time after the institution of the action, the parties no longer have a legally cognizable stake in the outcome.\" <i>Goodwin v. C.N.J., Inc.,</i> 436 F.3d 44, 46 (1st Cir.2006). This rule applies even where the case becomes moot while pending on appeal. <i>See Great Western Sugar Co. v. Nelson,</i> 442 U.S. 92, 93, 99 S.Ct. 2149, 60 L.Ed.2d 735 (1979) (per curiam). But \"[t]he burden of establishing mootness rests squarely on the party raising it, and the burden is a heavy one.\" <i>Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat,</i> 317 F.3d 45, 60 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). To establish mootness, the party raising it must show that the court cannot grant any \"effectual relief whatever\" to its opponent. <i>Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States,</i> 506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General has not met this heavy burden. The New York settlement agreement applies only to the delivery of cigarettes, but the Tobacco Delivery Law applies to \"any form of tobacco and any material or device used in the smoking, chewing or other form of tobacco consumption.\" 22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 1551-3. UPS could therefore adhere to the terms of the settlement agreement and nevertheless violate the Tobacco Delivery Law by unlawfully delivering non-cigarette tobacco products. Because enjoining the challenged provisions would permit UPS to deliver <i>all</i> tobacco products, effectual relief remains available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Preemption</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the merits of the district court's preemption ruling. We review the ruling de novo, considering the record and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the Attorney General. <i>See Mullin v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 164 F.3d 696, 698 (1st Cir.1999). We may affirm on any ground revealed by the record. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 183-84 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General presents two arguments for reversal. First, he contends that the FAAAA does not preempt state laws enacted pursuant to a state's police power to protect the health and welfare of its citizens. The Attorney General asserts that the FAAAA preempts only state laws that impose traditional economic regulation on carriers &#8212; e.g. entry and commodity controls, tariff filing requirements, and price ceilings. Because the Tobacco Delivery Law does not impose such traditional economic restrictions, the Attorney General argues that the FAAAA does not apply. Alternatively, the Attorney General contends that, even if the Act applies, neither challenged provision is \"related to\" carrier services within the meaning of the FAAAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Applicability of the FAAAA to a State's Police-Power Enactments</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fundamental tenet of our federalist system is that constitutionally enacted federal law is supreme to state law. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. Art. VI. cl. 2. As a result, federal law sometimes preempts state law either expressly or by implication. <i>See Gade v. Nat'l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass'n,</i> 505 U.S. 88, 98, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992). \"Express preemption occurs when Congress has unmistakably . . . ordained that its enactments alone are to regulate a subject and state laws regulating that subject must fall.\" <i>Mass. Ass'n of Health Maintenance Organizations v. Ruthardt,</i> 194 F.3d 176, 179 (1st Cir.1999) (citation omitted). In every preemption case, \"the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone.\" <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). The primary focus is on the \"plain wording\" of the statute because the text \"contains the best evidence of Congress' pre-emptive intent.\" <i>Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,</i> 537 U.S. 51, 62, 123 S.Ct. 518, 154 L.Ed.2d 466 (2002). But \"[a]lso relevant is the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole as revealed ... through the reviewing court's reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers and the law.\" <i>Medtronic,</i> 518 U.S. at 486, 116 S.Ct. 2240.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the text. As mentioned above, the FAAAA prohibits states from enacting laws \"related to a price, route, or service\" of a carrier. 49 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 14501(c) &amp; 41713(b)(4)(A). This language was patterned after the preemption provision of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 85, <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1757, 1759; <i>Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d at 1184; <i>Desardouin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 285 F.Supp.2d 153, 162 (D.Conn.2003). Therefore, in addition to cases interpreting the FAAAA, we look to cases interpreting the Airline Deregulation Act. <i>UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 335-36; <i>Mastercraft Interiors, Ltd. v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc.,</i> 284 F.Supp.2d 284, 287 (D.Md.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seminal case is <i>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 504 U.S. 374, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992). Like the FAAAA, the version of the Airline Deregulation Act considered in <i>Morales</i> preempted state laws \"relating to rates, routes or services of any air carrier.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The Court identified \"relating to\" as the key phrase in determining the breadth of the preemption provision and concluded that the \"words ... express a broad pre-emptive purpose.\" <i>Id.</i> at 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031. It relied on several cases in which the Court had interpreted a similarly-worded provision of the Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) preempting all state laws that \"relate to\" an employee benefit plan. <i>Id.</i> at 384, 112 S.Ct. 2031. The <i>Morales</i> Court emphasized that this language had an \"expansive sweep\" and that it was \"conspicuous for its breadth.\" <i>Id.</i> In light of Congress' use of similarly broad language, the Court concluded that Congress intended the Airline Deregulation Act to preempt any state law that has \"a connection with or reference to airline rates, routes, or services.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAAAA's drafters were familiar with <i>Morales</i> and approved of its reasoning.

Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 83, <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1755. The sweep of the FAAAA's text and the drafters' expressed intent to use <i>Morales</i> as a roadmap are strong evidence that the FAAAA was not intended to preempt only a narrow class of economic regulations while excluding the many laws enacted by the states under their police powers. If Congress had such a limited purpose in mind, it likely would have employed narrower language in fashioning the FAAAA preemption provisions. <i>Cf. Botz v. Omni Air Int'l,</i> 286 F.3d 488, 493-94 (8th Cir. 2002) (\"Although Congress could easily have selected more restrictive terminology to describe the type of . . . enactment the [Airline Deregulation Act] pre-empts, the provision as written is without language that would produce a more limited pre-emptive effect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General argues that we should disregard <i>Morales</i> because, post-<i>Morales,</i> the Supreme Court has narrowed its understanding of ERISA's \"relat[ing] to\" language.

While the <i>Morales</i> Court undoubtedly took its interpretive cues from the ERISA preemption jurisprudence then in existence, it does not follow that any change in the ERISA law necessitates a parallel change in the law affecting ... carriers.

The FAAAA includes a series of exceptions to the general preemption rule. The excepted areas are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles, the authority of a State to impose highway route controls or limitations based on the size or weight of the motor vehicle or the hazardous nature of the cargo, or the authority of a State to regulate motor carriers with regard to minimum amounts of financial responsibility relating to insurance requirements and self-insurance authorization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">49 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 14501(c)(2) &amp; 41713(b)(4)(B)(i). The Attorney General acknowledges that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law do not fall within any of these exceptions. He contends, however, that these statutory exceptions suggest broader congressional purpose to permit states to regulate carriers to protect citizen health and safety. The Attorney General points to a passage from the FAAAA's legislative history indicating that the enumerated exceptions were \"not intended to be all inclusive,\" H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 84, <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1756, to argue that we may establish an additional exception to FAAAA preemption for laws enacted pursuant to a state's police power to protect the health and welfare of its citizens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have cautioned that an overly broad interpretation of the FAAAA exceptions \"would swallow the rule of preemption.\" <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 385 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2004) (<i>UPS II</i>). An exclusion from preemption for police-power enactments would surely \"swallow the rule of preemption,\" as most state laws are enacted pursuant to this authority. <i>Id.</i> The exceptions preserving the states' authority to regulate motor vehicles do not support the Attorney General's argument. <i>See id.</i> (rejecting an argument that the FAAAA preemption exceptions indicate a congressional intent to preserve state authority over safety issues generally).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the statute's structure does not support the Attorney General's police-power argument, there is some support in the legislative history for his view that the FAAAA preempts only state economic regulation. The Conference Committee Report observed that \"[s]tate economic regulation of motor carriers ... is a huge problem for national and regional carriers attempting to conduct a standard way of doing business.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677 at 85, <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1757. The conferees identified \"typical forms\" of harmful regulation to include \"entry controls, tariff filing, price regulation,\" and regulation of the \"types of commodities carried.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1758. This history led the Supreme Court to remark that \"the problem to which the [FAAAA] congressional conferees attended was state economic regulation.\" <i>Columbus v. Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Serv.,</i> 536 U.S. 424, 440, 122 S.Ct. 2226, 153 L.Ed.2d 430 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This history, however, does not indicate that preempting economic regulation was the FAAAA's only purpose. And, in any event, the legislative history cannot trump the statute's text. <i>See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 504, 521, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (declining to adopt a limited interpretation of a preemption provision suggested by legislative history because \"the language of the [cigarette labeling] Act plainly reaches\" further); <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 385 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 2031 (The \"legislative history need not confirm the details of changes in the law effected by statutory language before we will interpret that language according to its natural meaning.\"). Congress often acts to address a specific problem but ultimately settles on a broader remedy. <i>See Penn. Dep't of Corr. v. Yeskey,</i> 524 U.S. 206, 213, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998) (\"[T]he fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the legislative history reveals a second goal for FAAAA preemption which is inconsistent with the Attorney's General argument: \"to create a completely level playing field between air carriers ... on the one hand and motor carriers on the other.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 85, <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1757. In other words, the conferees intended the scope of FAAAA and Airline Deregulation Act preemption to be coterminous. <i>See Ace Auto Body &amp; Towing Ltd. v. City of New York,</i> 171 F.3d 765, 772 (2d Cir.1999); <i>Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d at 1187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Airline Deregulation Act context, the Supreme Court has focused on the effect that a state law has on carrier operations, not on the state's purpose for enacting the law. In <i>Morales,</i> the Court found that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted a directive promulgated by several state attorneys general informing airlines that certain advertising practices would be considered to violate state consumer-protection laws. 504 U.S. at 379, 112 S.Ct. 2031. And, in <i>American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens,</i> 513 U.S. 219, 227-28, 115 S.Ct. 817, 130 L.Ed.2d 715 (1995), the Court held that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted a cause of action under the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act concerning the redemption of frequent-flier miles. In both cases, the Court's preemption analysis centered on the impact that the challenged state laws had on airline services and rates and not on the fact that the preempted laws were enacted pursuant to the states' police power to combat consumer fraud. <i>See Fla. Lime &amp; Avocado Growers v. Paul,</i> 373 U.S. 132, 150, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963) (describing the traditional state authority to pass laws to combat consumer fraud). The Court reached these conclusions over dissents by Justice Stevens arguing (similarly to the Attorney General here) that the state laws at issue should not be preempted because there was insufficient evidence of congressional intent to preempt state police-power enactments. <i>See Am. Airlines,</i> 513 U.S. at 235-31, 115 S.Ct. 817 (Steven, J. dissenting in part); <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 419-27, 112 S.Ct. 2031 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Morales</i> and <i>American Airlines</i> thus teach that, under the Airline Deregulation Act, the focus should be on the <i>effect</i> that the state law has on airline operations. Accepting the Attorney General's argument would shift the analysis under the FAAAA away from that state law's effect and towards the state's <i>purpose</i> for enacting the law. A purpose-related limitation on FAAAA preemption would thus inevitably create a gap between the scope of FAAAA and Airline Deregulation Act preemption &#8212; a gap which the FAAAA drafters sought to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the Attorney General's argument founders because it cannot be reconciled with the FAAAA's text. The Act's drafters chose to express the preemptive scope of the FAAAA in words that they understood to be exceedingly broad. In the preemption context, we are to give effect to the ordinary meaning of a congressional enactment \"unless there is good reason to believe that Congress intended the language to have some more restrictive meaning.\" <i>Cipollone,</i> 505 U.S. at 521, 112 S.Ct. 2608. We do not find a sufficiently compelling basis in either the structure or history of the FAAAA to interpret the Act contrary to its \"deliberately expansive text.\" <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 384, 112 S.Ct. 2031. We therefore conclude that the FAAAA preempts state police-power enactments to the extent that they are \"related to\" a carrier's prices, routes, or services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

The parties do not contest that carriers provide the service of delivering \"packages on an express or time-guaranteed basis.\" <i>See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n,</i> 377 F.Supp.2d at 209 (quoting <i>UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 336). But they disagree over whether the challenged provisions are \"related to\" this service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously interpreted the phrase \"related to\" as used in the FAAAA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"related to\" has a broad meaning in ordinary usage: to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring in association or connection with. When used in a preemption provision, such as [in the FAAAA], it has a similarly broad reach. State laws and regulations having a connection with or reference to a ... carrier's ... services are preempted under the [FAAAA]. A sufficient nexus exists if the law expressly references the ... carriers' ... services or has a forbidden significant effect on the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 335. We therefore consider whether the district court correctly concluded that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law either expressly reference carrier services or have a forbidden significant effect on UPS' services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with &#167; 1555-C(3)(C). As set forth above, this statute requires tobacco retailers seeking to ship tobacco products directly to Maine consumers to use only carriers that deliver the package directly to the addressee/purchaser, require a signature from the addressee/purchaser, and conduct age verification if the addressee/purchaser is under 27 years of age. Another section penalizes retailers that use carriers that do not provide these services. 22 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 1555-C(3)(E) &amp; (F).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1555-C(3)(C) expressly references a carrier's service of providing the timely delivery of packages. The statute prescribes the method by which a carrier operating in Maine must deliver packages containing tobacco products in a way that would affect the ability of the carrier to meet package-delivery deadlines. Delays in searching for the purchaser, making multiple delivery attempts if the purchaser cannot be located, obtaining the purchaser's signature, and verifying the purchaser's age all could affect timely deliveries. <i>See UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 336 (finding that the FAAAA preempted a state law that \"affect[ed] the timeliness and effectiveness\" of a carrier's service).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General responds that there is no FAAAA preemption because &#167; 1555-C(3)(C) regulates <i>retailers</i> of tobacco products and not carriers. He also argues that we should decline to find preemption because any carrier can avoid the requirements of &#167; 1555-C(3)(C) by declining to provide tobacco-product deliveries to Maine consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General's first argument amounts to a claim that there can be no FAAAA preemption unless the state law imposes a direct regulation on carriers. This argument cannot be squared with the FAAAA's text because it reads the broad phrase \"related to\" out of the statute and replaces it with the narrower term \"regulates.\" <i>See Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 385, 112 S.Ct. 2031 (rejecting an argument that would have read \"relating to\" out of the Airline Deregulation Act and replaced it with \"regulate\"); <i>UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 335 (rejecting an argument for narrowing scope of the FAAAA that \"would read `the related to language' out of the statute\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, limiting preemption to direct regulation of carriers is inconsistent with the FAAAA's purpose to bar states from policing carrier operations. <i>See Am. Airlines,</i> 513 U.S. at 228, 115 S.Ct. 817. A state may use its coercive power to cause carriers to conform to state-imposed rules in at least two ways: it may directly regulate carriers or it may limit retailers to hiring only those carriers that comply with the state-imposed mandates. Either way the state is employing its coercive power to police the method by which carriers provide services in the state. In short, the Attorney General's argument would lead to the untenable result of permitting states to regulate carrier services indirectly by regulating shippers. <i>Cf. Abington Sch. Dist. v. Schempp,</i> 374 U.S. 203, 230, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) (declining to adopt an interpretation that would permit states to do indirectly what they cannot do directly).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General's alternative argument &#8212; that there is no preemption because a carrier can forgo certain tobacco-product deliveries in Maine &#8212; also fails. Declining to find preemption simply because a carrier can limit its in-state business to avoid a particular requirement would undermine the FAAAA's goal of creating an environment in which \"[s]ervice options will be dictated by the marketplace,\" and not by state regulatory regimes. H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-677 at 88, <i>reprinted in</i> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1760. The district court correctly concluded that the FAAAA preempts &#167; 1555-C(3)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn finally to whether the FAAAA preempts &#167; 1555-D. In considering this question, we are mindful that courts should \"not nullify more of a legislature's work than is necessary, for ... a ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representative of the people.\" <i>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New England,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 961, 967, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006) (internal citation omitted). The first part of &#167; 1555-D makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to deliver to Maine consumers certain contraband tobacco products &#8212; i.e., those tobacco products purchased by consumers from unlicensed retailers. The second part of &#167; 1555-D charges a carrier with knowledge that a package contains tobacco products if the package is so marked or if the shipper appears on the Attorney General's list of unlicensed tobacco retailers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, tobacco products purchased by a consumer from an unlicensed retailer are contraband. <i>See</i> 22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 1555-C(7). The first part of &#167; 1555-D is a corollary to &#167; 1555-C(7) in that it makes the knowing delivery of contraband tobacco products illegal. Thus, the question we face is whether a generally applicable law barring any person from knowingly delivering contraband tobacco is preempted by the FAAAA insofar as the law pertains to carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the FAAAA's preemptive effect is broad, <i>see UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 335, it is not unlimited, <i>see Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d at 1188. State laws that only have a \"tenuous, remote, or peripheral\" relation to services are beyond the FAAAA's reach. <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2031; <i>Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d at 1188. In describing this limitation on preemption in the Airline Deregulation Act context, the Supreme Court explained that its broad interpretation of the statute's preemption provision did not place it \"on a road that leads to pre-emption of gambling and prostitution as applied to airlines.\" <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 390, 112 S.Ct. 2031. We understand the <i>Morales</i> Court to have meant that states may continue to enjoy the power to ban primary conduct, and that the ADA and FAAAA do not preempt laws applying these prohibitions to airlines and carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, <i>Morales</i> suggests that &#167; 1555-D's ban on the knowing delivery of contraband tobacco products is not preempted by the FAAAA &#8212; even only insofar as it pertains to carrier services. Section 1555-D requires that carriers do not act as <i>knowing</i> accomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products. It does not, however, require that carriers modify their delivery methods other than by declining to transport a product that Maine has legitimately banned. We think that this effect on services is \"too tenuous\" to warrant preemption. <i>Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d at 1189 (stating that a state law is too tenuous to be preempted by the FAAAA where the law does not frustrate the FAAAA's deregulatory purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the rule were otherwise, states would be unable to bar a primary method by which contraband crosses state lines. We do not believe that this was Congress' intent in enacting the FAAAA. Other courts applying the FAAAA to prohibitions on the delivery of contraband tobacco have reached similar conclusions. <i>See Robertson v. Liquor Control Bd.,</i> 102 Wash.App. 848, 10 P.3d 1079, 1084-85 (2000) (concluding that the FAAAA did not preempt a state law banning the transport of contraband cigarettes because otherwise \"a motor carrier would be exempt from forfeiture for transporting a methamphetamine lab or poached game\"); <i>see also N.Y. State Motor Truck Ass'n v. Pataki,</i> No. 03-CV-2386 (GBD), 2004 WL 2937803, at *6 (W.D.N.Y. Aug.19, 2003) (concluding that the FAAAA did not preempt a state law making it unlawful for carriers to deliver cigarettes directly to New York consumers because \"the mere fact that a statute concerns the transportation of a particular cargo by ... carriers ... does not render it ... unconstitutional on preemption grounds\"); <i>Ward v. New York,</i> 291 F.Supp.2d 188, 210-211 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (similar).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, while Maine may ban a carrier from knowingly transporting contraband tobacco products, it may not dictate the procedures that a carrier should employ to locate these products in its delivery chain. <i>See UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 336 (concluding that the FAAAA preempted a Puerto Rico revenue-collection scheme that mandated procedures that carriers had to follow to deliver certain packages). The second part of &#167; 1555-D violates this principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, &#167; 1555-D imposes upon a carrier constructive knowledge that it has delivered a tobacco product if the package containing the product is marked as containing tobacco or if the seller's name appears on the Attorney General's list. As UPS' experience demonstrates, a carrier seeking to comply with &#167; 1555-D must specially inspect every package destined for delivery in Maine. Once the carrier has finished this inspection, it must segregate the packages that contain tobacco and research whether the addressee is a Maine-licensed retailer or distributor who can receive the package. While the second part of &#167; 1555-D does not expressly reference carrier services, it \"impermissibly affect[s] ... services ... because it requir[es] UPS to identify the contents of the packages (a deviation from standard procedures used in deliveries elsewhere in the United States). . . .\" <i>UPS II,</i> 385 F.2d at 14 (parenthesis in original). UPS can only provide timely package delivery if it follows uniform procedures that allow for \"an orderly flow of packages.\" <i>UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 336. Because the second part of &#167; 1555-D has the effect of forcing UPS to change its uniform package-processing procedures, the district court correctly found it to be preempted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that there is a potential tension between saying that, on the one hand, Maine is free to punish the knowing delivery of material that it has classified as contraband, while, on the other hand, ruling that it may not dictate or interfere with a carrier's delivery procedures. What we are saying here, however, is that Maine cannot use the mechanisms outlined in the statute to <i>impute</i> knowledge based on a failure to read labels or consult lists &#8212; an imputation which would amount to prescribing how carriers must operate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, however, Maine could prove that a carrier employee had actual knowledge that a package being delivered was contraband tobacco, then it might have a colorable enforcement case &#8212; although such circumstances, as a practical matter, may be difficult to prove. True, the \"related to\" language could stretch to such a case but it could also stretch to the knowing delivery of hard drugs &#8212; and Congress cannot have intended such a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]obacco use, particularly among children and adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant public health problem in the United States.\" <i>FDA v.

There is no question that Maine has sought to achieve a worthy objective by passing the Tobacco Delivery Law to combat this pernicious problem. <i>See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n,</i> 377 F.Supp.2d at 219. But the FAAAA focuses on the effect that a state's law has on carriers, and not on the state's objective in passing the law. To the extent that Maine's Tobacco Delivery Law requires (or has the effect of requiring) carriers to implement state-mandated procedures in the processing and delivery of packages, it is preempted by the FAAAA.

The Attorney General contends that the Synar Amendment demonstrates Congress' intent that the states be able to regulate the delivery of tobacco products irrespective of the FAAAA. We disagree. The Synar Amendment indicates Congress' intent that the states take the lead in addressing the underage smoking problem. But the Attorney General has not identified any evidence that Congress intended the states do so in derogation of other federal laws. The FAAAA and Synar Amendment can exist harmoniously because the states may pass laws to curb underage smoking without passing laws \"related to\" carrier prices, routes, or services. <i>See UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 333-34 (stating that courts should endeavor to read congressional enactments in harmony whenever possible).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> There are many state laws barring the transport and delivery of contraband<i>E.g.,</i> Ala.Code &#167; 2-14-5 (barring transport of certain products related to bee keeping); Ariz.

Several trade associations, representing air and motor carriers of property, brought this action against the Maine Attorney General alleging that certain provisions of this law are preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA). The district court granted summary judgment for the associations and enjoined Maine's Attorney General from enforcing the law.

(codified at 22 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 1551, 1555-C &amp; 1555-D) (Tobacco Delivery Law). The Tobacco Delivery Law was prompted by the recent increase in internet tobacco sales which are consummated by direct delivery to consumers through the mail or by commercial carriers. <i>See</i> Testimony of Representative Glen Cummings Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health &amp; Human Services (Apr. 29, 2003). This phenomenon has complicated Maine's efforts to regulate \"the sale of tobacco products to minors\" and caused it to lose \"tremendous tax revenues as a result of tax free sales by unlicensed companies.\" <i>Id.</i> The associations persuaded the district court that &#167;&#167; 1555-C(3)(C) &amp; 1555-D are preempted by the FAAAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. &#167; 1555-C(3)(C)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's Tobacco Delivery Law permits a licensed tobacco retailer to sell tobacco products<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> directly to consumers via the internet or other electronic means so long as the retailer takes specified steps to ensure that sales are not made to minors. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1555-C(2) &amp; (3). One such step requires the retailer to use a carrier that will ensure that: (1) the purchaser of the tobacco products is the same person as the addressee of the package; (2) the addressee is of legal age to purchase tobacco products and sign for the package; and (3) if the addressee is under 27 years of age, that she show a valid government-issued identification verifying that she is old enough to purchase tobacco products. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1555-C(3)(C).

The associations have attempted to make this showing by highlighting the effect of the challenged provisions on UPS, a motor/air carrier of property operating in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UPS, which delivers approximately 65,000 packages per day in Maine, offers door-to-door delivery service of packages and delivery of packages on an express basis. Its delivery operations function as an integrated system, requiring extensive planning and coordination among its operating facilities and ground and air fleet. Delays and disruptions in the sorting and delivery of packages can affect the timely delivery of thousands of packages within the UPS system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the enactment of &#167; 1555-C(3)(C), UPS did not require that its drivers deliver a package only to the addressee, and it did not require a signature from the recipient of the package unless the shipper paid a premium for this additional service. UPS determined that it would not be feasible to alter its delivery operations to provide these new services in Maine, so it stopped delivering all tobacco products to Maine consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make deliveries of tobacco products to licensed retailers and distributors in Maine as permitted by &#167; 1555-D, UPS now has modified its uniform package delivery procedures to identify packages that contain tobacco products. UPS requires that its preloaders in Maine (the employees who place the packages on the trucks for delivery) specially examine each package to determine if it is marked as containing tobacco or if the name of the addressee or shipper indicates that the package likely contains tobacco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Packages identified as likely containing tobacco products are then segregated so that UPS employees can research whether the package is destined for a licensed tobacco retailer or distributor. If UPS determines that the addressee is not a licensed tobacco retailer or distributor, it arranges to return the package to the shipper or otherwise to dispose of the package.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The District Court Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding from the premise that the FAAAA preempts a state law if it \"expressly references\" a carrier's prices, routes, or services or has a \"forbidden significant effect\" on the same, the district court concluded that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law are preempted by the FAAAA. <i>See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n v. Rowe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384230\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384230/new-hampshire-motor-transport-assn-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 210 (D.Me.2005) (citing <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v.

The court determined that, while &#167; 1555-C(3)(C) did not expressly reference carrier services because that section is directed only at retailers of tobacco products, it has a forbidden significant effect on UPS because, for the carrier to accept packages containing tobacco for delivery in Maine, it would have to adopt procedures that would \"alter [its] delivery practices\" for these packages. <i>Id.</i> at 216.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also ruled that &#167; 1555-D both expressly references and has a forbidden significant effect on carrier services. It concluded that the provision expressly references services because it prohibits carriers from delivering a certain class of tobacco products, i.e., tobacco products purchased by Maine consumers from unlicensed retailers. <i>See id.</i> at 211-12. It also concluded that the provision also has a forbidden significant effect because it forced UPS to depart from \"its nationally uniform procedure\" by inspecting each package to identify the contents. <i>Id.</i> at 212. The Attorney General timely appealed from this ruling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before reaching the merits of the Attorney General's appeal, we consider two threshold jurisdictional issues. The Attorney General asserts that the associations lack standing and that the action is moot in light of events occurring subsequent to the noticing of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The associations invoke the representational standing doctrine recognized by the Supreme Court in <i>Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver. Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 343, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span> (1977). Under this doctrine, \"an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individualized members in the lawsuit.\" <i>Id.</i> The Attorney General focuses his argument on the third <i>Hunt</i> factor. He contends that evidence concerning the effect that the challenged provisions of the Tobacco Delivery Law have on UPS suffices only to justify preemption of the challenged provisions as to UPS. Preemption against other carriers should occur only to the extent that the other carriers individually prove that the challenged provisions have a forbidden significant effect on their prices, routes, or services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this argument, observing that \"[a]ssociational standing is ... granted in cases seeking injunctive relief rather than damages, because individualized proof is not necessary and the relief usually inures to the benefit of all members injured.\" <i>N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 236 (D.Me.2004). Because the associations only sought an injunction and a declaratory judgment against the challenged provisions, the court ruled that the third <i>Hunt</i> factor was satisfied. <i>See id.</i> at 236 (citing <i>Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543590\"><a href=\"/opinion/543590/playboy-enterprises-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir. 1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court issued this ruling, we clarified the requirements for establishing the third <i>Hunt</i> factor. In so doing, we acknowledged that \"there is no well developed test in this circuit as to how the third prong of the <i>Hunt</i> test . . . applies in cases where injunctive relief is sought.\" <i>Pharmaceutical Care Mgmt.

But we did not embrace the proposition that, under <i>Playboy Enters.</i> the third <i>Hunt</i> factor is always satisfied where an association seeks injunctive relief on behalf of all of its members. <i>See Rowe,</i> 429 F.3d at 314 (\"<i>Playboy</i> is not an open door for association standing in all injunction cases where member circumstances differ and proof of them is important.\").

Accepting the Attorney General's argument would shift the analysis under the FAAAA away from that state law's effect and towards the state's <i>purpose</i> for enacting the law. A purpose-related limitation on FAAAA preemption would thus inevitably create a gap between the scope of FAAAA and Airline Deregulation Act preemption &#8212; a gap which the FAAAA drafters sought to avoid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the Attorney General's argument founders because it cannot be reconciled with the FAAAA's text. The Act's drafters chose to express the preemptive scope of the FAAAA in words that they understood to be exceedingly broad. In the preemption context, we are to give effect to the ordinary meaning of a congressional enactment \"unless there is good reason to believe that Congress intended the language to have some more restrictive meaning.\" <i>Cipollone,</i> 505 U.S. at 521, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112777\"><a href=\"/opinion/112777/cipollone-v-liggett-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We therefore conclude that the FAAAA preempts state police-power enactments to the extent that they are \"related to\" a carrier's prices, routes, or services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Ass'n,</i> 377 F.Supp.2d at 209 (quoting <i>UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 336).

When used in a preemption provision, such as [in the FAAAA], it has a similarly broad reach. State laws and regulations having a connection with or reference to a ... carrier's ... services are preempted under the [FAAAA].

As set forth above, this statute requires tobacco retailers seeking to ship tobacco products directly to Maine consumers to use only carriers that deliver the package directly to the addressee/purchaser, require a signature from the addressee/purchaser, and conduct age verification if the addressee/purchaser is under 27 years of age. Another section penalizes retailers that use carriers that do not provide these services. 22 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 1555-C(3)(E) &amp; (F).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1555-C(3)(C) expressly references a carrier's service of providing the timely delivery of packages. The statute prescribes the method by which a carrier operating in Maine must deliver packages containing tobacco products in a way that would affect the ability of the carrier to meet package-delivery deadlines. Delays in searching for the purchaser, making multiple delivery attempts if the purchaser cannot be located, obtaining the purchaser's signature, and verifying the purchaser's age all could affect timely deliveries. <i>See UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 336 (finding that the FAAAA preempted a state law that \"affect[ed] the timeliness and effectiveness\" of a carrier's service).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General responds that there is no FAAAA preemption because &#167; 1555-C(3)(C) regulates <i>retailers</i> of tobacco products and not carriers. He also argues that we should decline to find preemption because any carrier can avoid the requirements of &#167; 1555-C(3)(C) by declining to provide tobacco-product deliveries to Maine consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General's first argument amounts to a claim that there can be no FAAAA preemption unless the state law imposes a direct regulation on carriers. This argument cannot be squared with the FAAAA's text because it reads the broad phrase \"related to\" out of the statute and replaces it with the narrower term \"regulates.\" <i>See Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 385, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>. A state may use its coercive power to cause carriers to conform to state-imposed rules in at least two ways: it may directly regulate carriers or it may limit retailers to hiring only those carriers that comply with the state-imposed mandates. Either way the state is employing its coercive power to police the method by which carriers provide services in the state. In short, the Attorney General's argument would lead to the untenable result of permitting states to regulate carrier services indirectly by regulating shippers. <i>Cf. Abington Sch. Dist. v.

The first part of &#167; 1555-D is a corollary to &#167; 1555-C(7) in that it makes the knowing delivery of contraband tobacco products illegal. Thus, the question we face is whether a generally applicable law barring any person from knowingly delivering contraband tobacco is preempted by the FAAAA insofar as the law pertains to carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the FAAAA's preemptive effect is broad, <i>see UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 335, it is not unlimited, <i>see Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d at 1188.

In describing this limitation on preemption in the Airline Deregulation Act context, the Supreme Court explained that its broad interpretation of the statute's preemption provision did not place it \"on a road that leads to pre-emption of gambling and prostitution as applied to airlines.\" <i>Morales,</i> 504 U.S. at 390, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112742\"><a href=\"/opinion/112742/morales-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2031</span></a></span>. We understand the <i>Morales</i> Court to have meant that states may continue to enjoy the power to ban primary conduct, and that the ADA and FAAAA do not preempt laws applying these prohibitions to airlines and carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, <i>Morales</i> suggests that &#167; 1555-D's ban on the knowing delivery of contraband tobacco products is not preempted by the FAAAA &#8212; even only insofar as it pertains to carrier services. Section 1555-D requires that carriers do not act as <i>knowing</i> accomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products. It does not, however, require that carriers modify their delivery methods other than by declining to transport a product that Maine has legitimately banned. We think that this effect on services is \"too tenuous\" to warrant preemption. <i>Mendonca,</i> 152 F.3d at 1189 (stating that a state law is too tenuous to be preempted by the FAAAA where the law does not frustrate the FAAAA's deregulatory purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the rule were otherwise, states would be unable to bar a primary method by which contraband crosses state lines.

The second part of &#167; 1555-D violates this principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, &#167; 1555-D imposes upon a carrier constructive knowledge that it has delivered a tobacco product if the package containing the product is marked as containing tobacco or if the seller's name appears on the Attorney General's list. As UPS' experience demonstrates, a carrier seeking to comply with &#167; 1555-D must specially inspect every package destined for delivery in Maine. Once the carrier has finished this inspection, it must segregate the packages that contain tobacco and research whether the addressee is a Maine-licensed retailer or distributor who can receive the package. While the second part of &#167; 1555-D does not expressly reference carrier services, it \"impermissibly affect[s] ... services ... because it requir[es] UPS to identify the contents of the packages (a deviation from standard procedures used in deliveries elsewhere in the United States). . . .\" <i>UPS II,</i> 385 F.2d at 14 (parenthesis in original). UPS can only provide timely package delivery if it follows uniform procedures that allow for \"an orderly flow of packages.\" <i>UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 336. Because the second part of &#167; 1555-D has the effect of forcing UPS to change its uniform package-processing procedures, the district court correctly found it to be preempted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that there is a potential tension between saying that, on the one hand, Maine is free to punish the knowing delivery of material that it has classified as contraband, while, on the other hand, ruling that it may not dictate or interfere with a carrier's delivery procedures. What we are saying here, however, is that Maine cannot use the mechanisms outlined in the statute to <i>impute</i> knowledge based on a failure to read labels or consult lists &#8212; an imputation which would amount to prescribing how carriers must operate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, however, Maine could prove that a carrier employee had actual knowledge that a package being delivered was contraband tobacco, then it might have a colorable enforcement case &#8212; although such circumstances, as a practical matter, may be difficult to prove. True, the \"related to\" language could stretch to such a case but it could also stretch to the knowing delivery of hard drugs &#8212; and Congress cannot have intended such a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]obacco use, particularly among children and adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant public health problem in the United States.\" <i>FDA v.

There is no question that Maine has sought to achieve a worthy objective by passing the Tobacco Delivery Law to combat this pernicious problem. <i>See N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n,</i> 377 F.Supp.2d at 219. But the FAAAA focuses on the effect that a state's law has on carriers, and not on the state's objective in passing the law. To the extent that Maine's Tobacco Delivery Law requires (or has the effect of requiring) carriers to implement state-mandated procedures in the processing and delivery of packages, it is preempted by the FAAAA. But to the extent that the Tobacco Delivery Law merely bars all persons (including carriers) from knowingly transporting contraband tobacco into Maine, the FAAAA is not implicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the judgment as it pertains to 22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 1555-C(3)(C) and the second part of 22 M.R.S.A. &#167; 1555-D but <i>reverse</i> the judgment as it pertains to the first part of &#167; 1555-D.

He cites the Synar Amendment, a federal law conditioning the states' receipt of certain federal funds on their enacting laws to ban the sale of tobacco products to minors<i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300x-26. The Attorney General contends that the Synar Amendment demonstrates Congress' intent that the states be able to regulate the delivery of tobacco products irrespective of the FAAAA. We disagree. The Synar Amendment indicates Congress' intent that the states take the lead in addressing the underage smoking problem. But the Attorney General has not identified any evidence that Congress intended the states do so in derogation of other federal laws. The FAAAA and Synar Amendment can exist harmoniously because the states may pass laws to curb underage smoking without passing laws \"related to\" carrier prices, routes, or services. <i>See UPS I,</i> 318 F.3d at 333-34 (stating that courts should endeavor to read congressional enactments in harmony whenever possible).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> There are many state laws barring the transport and delivery of contraband<i>E.g.,</i> Ala.Code &#167; 2-14-5 (barring transport of certain products related to bee keeping); Ariz.

Penal Law &#167; 190.50 (barring transport of slot machines or other gambling devices). We have not a found a single case, outside the tobacco context, in which bans on the transport of contraband have been challenged as preempted by the FAAAA. <i>Cf.</i> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, <i>Silver Blaze</i> (1890) (William S.
