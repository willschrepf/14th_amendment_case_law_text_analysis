In this appeal, we decide whether 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(e), a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), precludes prisoners from\nasserting meritorious § 1983 claims alleging First Amendment violations merely because those\nviolations did not also cause physical harm. After Kevin King, an inmate held by the Michigan\n\n         *\n         The Honorable Sandra S. Beckwith, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting\nby designation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        1\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v. Zamiara et al.                       Page 2\n\nDepartment of Corrections (“MDOC”), participated in a class-action lawsuit designed to\nchallenge personal property policies at MDOC facilities (the “Cain litigation”), prison officials\ntransferred him to a prison with a higher security classification and more restrictive conditions.\nKing filed suit against Chuck Zamiara, Curtis Chaffee, Sharon Wells, and other prison officials\n(the “prison officials”) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We have previously held that Zamiara, Chaffee,\nand Wells are liable for retaliating against King for his First Amendment-protected conduct,\nnamely participating in the Cain litigation and assisting other petitioners to file grievances. After\nwe remanded the case back to the district court, the court granted compensatory damages and\nawarded attorney fees, but denied punitive damages and injunctive relief. Both parties appealed.\nFor the following reasons, we VACATE the district court’s judgment and REMAND for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Our previous opinions thoroughly discuss the facts of this case. See King v. Zamiara,\n680 F.3d 686, 688–94 (6th Cir. 2012) (“King V”). As pertinent to this appeal, the facts are as\nfollows: Kevin King was incarcerated in 1983 after his conviction for first-degree murder. As\nof November 1999, King was housed in the Conklin Unit at Brooks Correctional Facility\n(“Brooks”), a Level II facility. On April 20, 2000, Sharon Wells, the Resident Unit Manager of\nConklin Unit, requested that King be transferred to another unit because he was “becoming\nincreasingly more powerful in the eyes of the prisoners in Conklin Unit.” R. 11-2 (Wells Memo)\n(Page ID #132).     Curtis Chaffee, the transfer coordinator at Brooks, requested that Chuck\nZamiara, an MDOC classification specialist, approve a transfer to another Level II facility. R.\n130-3 (Chaffee/Zamiara Email) (Page ID #788). After consulting with Classification Director\nNick Ludwick, Zamiara instead approved a transfer to a Level III facility because King was\n“preceived [sic] as a disruptive prisoner who is manipulating others to create unrest.” Id. The\nsecurity screen entered into King’s file was hand-edited to replace a note that King was\n“manageable in Level II” with a note scoring him at Level III. R. 130-3 (Chaffee Screen) (Page\nID #784). King was transferred to Chippewa Correctional Facility (“Chippewa”), a Level III\nfacility, on May 17, 2000.\n\fNo. 13-1766                           King v. Zamiara et al.                     Page 3\n\n        A Level III facility operates under more heightened security procedures than a Level II\nfacility. Although the Warden testified that “[t]here’s very little difference” between the two\nsecurity levels and that each facility sets its own schedules and programming, R. 171 (Trial Tr. I\nat 125–26) (Page ID #1557–58), another prison official testified that there were differences\nbetween Level II and Level III facilities in terms of visitation, programming, and activities. R.\n172 (Trial Tr. II at 272–74) (Page ID #1706–08).           In addition, King testified to several\nsubstantial differences between the two facilities.      King explained that his access to other\nprisoners during “yard time” and free time in the day rooms was significantly restricted at the\nLevel III facility. He was inhibited from “communicat[ing] with who [he] wanted to” because he\nwas unable to move freely between common spaces. R. 171 (Trial Tr. I at 92–97) (Page ID\n#1524–29). The movement restrictions in Level III affected King’s ability to assist with the Cain\nlitigation: “I was less able to get affidavits, declarations to discover what was going on with the\ndepartment up there at the time because I was pretty much secluded. I had to move with the\nmasses that they chose that I move with.” Id. at 98 (Page ID #1530). King continually objected\nto his Level III classification, and in February 2001 he was approved for a transfer to Thumb\nCorrectional Facility, a Level II facility.\n\n        On July 26, 2002, King filed a pro se complaint alleging First Amendment retaliation\nagainst several MDOC employees. R. 1 (Compl.) (Page ID #1–18). The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that King had not engaged in any form\nof protected conduct. R. 30 (D. Ct. Order) (Page ID #352). King appealed, and we reversed.\nKing v. Zamiara, 150 F. App’x 485 (6th Cir. 2005) (“King I”). We concluded that King made a\nprima facie showing of the elements of his First Amendment retaliation claim:              that his\nparticipation in the Cain litigation and his assistance to other prisoners in filing grievances were\nexamples of First Amendment-protected conduct, that the defendants took “adverse” actions\nagainst him by increasing his security level and charging him with misconduct tickets, and that\nthere was a causal connection between the protected activity and the increase in security level.\nKing I, 150 F. App’x at 491–95. We remanded the case to the district court to determine whether\nthe defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Id. at 490.\n\fNo. 13-1766                            King v. Zamiara et al.                          Page 4\n\n        On remand, the district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss on the basis of\nqualified immunity. King v. Zamiara, No. 4:02-cv-141, 2006 WL 2439732, at *1 (W.D. Mich.\nAug. 22, 2006) (“King II”). King appealed, and we again reversed. King v. Zamiara, No. 06-\n2271, slip op. at 4 (6th Cir. April 26, 2007) (“King III”). On remand, both parties moved for\nsummary judgment, and the district court granted both motions in part. The case proceeded to\ntrial on the question of causation. Following a two-day bench trial, the district court found in\nfavor of the defendants. King v. Zamiara, No. 4:02-CV-141, 2009 WL 3424221, at *9 (W.D.\nMich. Oct. 20, 2009) (“King IV”).\n\n        King appealed once again. We affirmed the district court’s judgment as to two of the\ndefendants because King presented insufficient proof that those defendants had knowledge of the\nconstitutional violation and retaliatory motive. King V, 680 F.3d at 705–07. We reversed the\ndistrict court’s judgment with respect to Wells, Chaffee, and Zamiara, and remanded the case for\nentry of judgment in favor of King as against the three defendants. Id. at 710. On remand, the\ndistrict court entered judgment in favor of King, and ordered $1,475 in compensatory damages\nand $2,212.50 in attorney fees. King v. Zamiara, No. 4:02-CV-141, 2013 WL 2102655 (W.D.\nMich. May 14, 2013) (“King VI”). The district court denied King’s request for punitive damages\nand injunctive relief. Both parties now appeal the judgment.\n\n                                II. COMPENSATORY DAMAGES\n\nA. Applicability of § 1997e(e) to First Amendment Claims\n\n        The district court granted a compensatory-damages award to King because the retaliatory\nincrease in his security level deprived him of his First Amendment right to participate in the Cain\nlitigation. The PLRA provides that “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner\nconfined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered\nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). The\napplicability of this provision to claims alleging First Amendment deprivations has been a matter\nof significant debate. Many circuits, following common-law tort principles1, conclude that First\nAmendment claims that do not allege physical injury necessarily allege compensable injury only\n\n        1\n         At common law, a claim for compensatory damages must allege actual injury in the form of bodily or\nemotional harm. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 905.\n\fNo. 13-1766                         King v. Zamiara et al.                       Page 5\n\nin the form of mental or emotional harms. See, e.g., Geiger v. Jowers, 404 F.3d 371, 374–75\n(5th Cir. 2005); Royal v. Kautzky, 375 F.3d 720, 723–24 (8th Cir. 2004); Searles v. Van Bebber,\n251 F.3d 869, 875–76 (10th Cir. 2001); Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247, 250 (3d Cir. 2000).\nOthers have determined that claims alleging “deprivation[s] of First Amendment rights entitle[] a\nplaintiff to judicial relief wholly aside from any physical injury he can show, or any mental or\nemotional injury he may have incurred.” Canell v. Lightner, 143 F.3d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir.\n1998) (concluding that a prisoner’s claim based on a guard’s attempt to convert him to\nChristianity asserted a right to relief for a violation of his First Amendment rights, not for\n“mental or emotional injury”); see also Royal, 375 F.3d at 730 (Heaney, J., dissenting)\n(“Certainly First Amendment violations can result in mental or emotional injury, and perhaps\neven physical injury, but § 1983 claims for First Amendment violations are not brought to\nredress such injuries. They are brought to redress the actual violation of the right.”); Rowe v.\nShake, 196 F.3d 778, 781–82 (7th Cir. 1999) (“A prisoner is entitled to judicial relief for a\nviolation of his First Amendment rights aside from any physical, mental, or emotional injury he\nmay have sustained.”). In Rowe, the court reasoned that “the loss of First Amendment freedoms\nfor even minimal periods of time constitutes irreparable injury.” Id. at 781 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Thus, the prisoner’s allegation that he suffered a First Amendment injury as a\nconsequence of interference with his mail delivery was cognizable under the PLRA, even absent\nallegations of additional physical injury. Id.; see also Robinson v. Page, 170 F.3d 747, 748 (7th\nCir. 1999) (“It would be a serious mistake to interpret section 1997e(e) to require a showing of\nphysical injury in all prisoner civil rights suits. The domain of the statute is limited to suits in\nwhich mental or emotional injury is claimed.”).\n\n       The Sixth Circuit has never squarely addressed in a published opinion whether\n§ 1997e(e) bars claims alleging First Amendment violations that do not result in physical injury.\nSee Taylor v. United States, 161 F. App’x 483, 487 (6th Cir. 2005) (declining to address the issue\nbecause the prisoner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies). But see Williams v. Ollis,\n230 F.3d 1361 (6th Cir. 2000) (unpublished table order) (permitting a prisoner to pursue a claim\nfor money damages arising from First Amendment violations). For the following reasons, we are\npersuaded that deprivations of First Amendment rights are themselves injuries, apart from any\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v. Zamiara et al.                         Page 6\n\nmental, emotional, or physical injury that might also arise from the deprivation, and that\n§ 1997e(e) does not bar all relief for injuries to First Amendment rights.\n\n       When interpreting a statute, we begin with the plain meaning of the statutory language.\nWalker v. Bain, 257 F.3d 660, 666 (6th Cir. 2001). “Every word in the statute is presumed to\nhave meaning, and we must give effect to all the words to avoid an interpretation which would\nrender words superfluous or redundant.” Id. at 667. The majority of circuits embrace a broad\nview of the PLRA’s statutory language and conclude that, regardless of the underlying\nconstitutional violation, if the plaintiff fails to allege physical injury, § 1997e(e) bars\ncompensatory damages. See, e.g., Geiger, 404 F.3d at 374–75. However, this interpretation\ndoes not accord with the statutory language: The statute provides that a prisoner may not bring a\ncivil action for mental or emotional injury unless he has also suffered a physical injury.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). It says nothing about claims brought to redress constitutional injuries,\nwhich are distinct from mental and emotional injuries. See Rowe, 196 F.3d at 781–82 (“A\nprisoner is entitled to judicial relief for a violation of his First Amendment rights aside from any\nphysical, mental, or emotional injury he may have sustained.”); Canell, 143 F.3d at 1213 (same).\nWere we to construe § 1997e(e) as the majority of courts have done, thereby grafting a physical-\ninjury requirement onto claims that allege First Amendment violations as the injury, the phrase\n“for mental or emotional injury” would be rendered superfluous. See Amaker v. Haponik, No. 98\nCIV 2663, 1999 WL 76798, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 1999). Therefore, the plain language of the\nstatute does not bar claims for constitutional injury that do not also involve physical injury. See\nRobinson, 170 F.3d at 748 (Posner, J.) (“It would be a serious mistake to interpret section\n1997e(e) to require a showing of physical injury in all prisoner civil rights suits. The domain of\nthe statute is limited to suits in which mental or emotional injury is claimed.”)\n\n       Accordingly, we hold that § 1997e(e) does not foreclose claims that allege violations of\nFirst Amendment-protected rights as injuries.       King’s claim alleges a constitutional injury\ndistinct from any mental or emotional injury he might have suffered: He claims that he was\nplaced in a higher security facility for approximately ten months in retaliation for his exercise of\nhis First Amendment rights. R. 1 (Compl. ¶ 50) (Page ID #8). While at the more secure facility,\nKing suffered infringements on his First Amendment rights because additional restrictions on his\n\fNo. 13-1766                            King v. Zamiara et al.                      Page 7\n\nmovements hindered his attempts to collect affidavits and declarations from other prisoners to\nassist in the Cain litigation. R. 171 (Trial Tr. I at 98) (Page ID #1530). Because King’s claim is\nnot “for mental or emotional injury,” § 1997e(e) does not preclude his claim merely because he\ndoes not also claim physical injury.\n\nB. Compensatory Damages Award\n\n       King can recover compensatory damages for the violation of his First Amendment rights\nin this case. A plaintiff who alleges the violation of a constitutional right is not entitled to\ncompensatory damages unless he can prove actual injury caused by the violation. Carey v.\nPiphus, 435 U.S. 247, 264 (1978).          Moreover, “damages based on the abstract ‘value’ or\n‘importance’ of constitutional rights are not a permissible element of compensatory damages.”\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 310 (1986); see also Parrish v. Johnson,\n800 F.2d 600, 607 (6th Cir. 1986). The Stachura court made clear, however, that “[w]hen a\nplaintiff seeks compensation for an injury that is likely to have occurred but difficult to establish,\nsome form of presumed damages may possibly be appropriate.” Stachura, 477 U.S. at 310–11.\nIn these cases of difficult-to-establish injuries, “presumed damages may roughly approximate the\nharm that the plaintiff suffered and thereby compensate for harms that may be impossible to\nmeasure.” Id. at 311. As an example of such a situation, the Supreme Court “cited with\napproval the long line of cases which uphold money damages as compensation for persons\ndeprived of their right to vote.” Walje v. City of Winchester, 827 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir. 1987).\nThe Supreme Court explained that in one of these cases, Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536 (1927),\nthe award of damages “did not rest on the ‘value’ of the right to vote as an abstract matter; rather,\nthe Court recognized that the plaintiff had suffered a particular injury—his inability to vote in a\nparticular election—that might be compensated through substantial money damages.” Stachura,\n477 U.S. at 311 n.14.\n\n       In sum, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she suffered an actual injury in order to\nreceive compensatory damages for violations of his or her constitutional rights. When it is\ndifficult to quantify precisely the damages caused by that injury, presumed damages may be\nawarded, but “[t]he award must focus on the real injury sustained and not on either the abstract\nvalue of the constitutional right at issue, see Carey, or the importance of the right in our system\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v. Zamiara et al.                        Page 8\n\nof government, see Stachura.” Piver v. Pender Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 835 F.2d 1076, 1082 (4th Cir.\n1987) (emphasis added).\n\n       Accordingly, courts have allowed plaintiffs to recover presumed damages for actual\ninjuries caused by constitutional violations that are “likely to have occurred” but difficult to\nmeasure, even when the injury claimed is neither physical harm nor mental or emotional distress.\nIn City of Watseka v. Illinois Public Action Council, 796 F.2d 1547 (7th Cir. 1986), aff’d,\n479 U.S. 1048 (1987), the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision that a city\nordinance limiting door-to-door soliciting to between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. was\nunconstitutional and upheld the district court’s award of $5,000 in compensatory damages to the\nplaintiff IPAC for the violation of its First Amendment rights. Id. at 1548, 1559. In addition to\nlost revenues, IPAC alleged less readily quantifiable injuries including “(1) its inability to recruit\nnew members in Watseka, (2) its inability to disseminate its views to Watseka residents, and (3)\nits inability to encourage Watseka citizens to support IPAC positions on various issues by\nsigning petitions or contacting local legislators.” Id. at 1558. Although “the monetary value of\nthe particular injury [was] difficult to ascertain,” the Seventh Circuit upheld the district court’s\ndamages award because the court’s “order ma[d]e[] it clear that [the court] was awarding IPAC\ndamages because Watseka ‘prevented [IPAC] from exercising its First Amendment rights in this\ncase;’ [the court] did not base the award on any abstract value of the constitutional right.” Id. at\n1559. The Seventh Circuit explained that the award was based on “specific compensable, non-\nabstract harm to IPAC . . . [as] seen from the specific injuries alleged by IPAC,” and concluded\nthat the “[t]he type of particular injury for which [the district court] awarded IPAC $5,000 is\nindistinguishable from the particular injury for which the Court approved compensatory damages\nin Nixon v. Herndon.” Id.\n\n       Similarly, in Kerman v. City of New York, 374 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit\nheld that the district court erred in not instructing the jury that it could award the plaintiff\ncompensatory damages for the loss of liberty he suffered as a result of the violation of his Fourth\nAmendment rights. Id. at 129. The Second Circuit explained that “the Supreme Court in\nStachura, in disapproving the instructions that would have allowed an award based on the\nabstract societal value of constitutional protections, expressly distinguished that impermissible\n\fNo. 13-1766                                 King v. Zamiara et al.                                Page 9\n\nabstraction from the theory that is pertinent here, to wit, the traditionally permissible concept of\n‘presumed damages.’” Id. at 130. The court then continued that “[t]he present case does not\ninvolve . . . an attempt to vindicate an abstract societal interest. Rather, it involves an anything-\nbut-abstract physical detention. And although a given person’s loss of time may be difficult to\nevaluate in terms of dollars, his loss of liberty is not just ‘virtually certain’ to occur; it is\ninseparable from the detention itself.” Id.\n\n         In this case, the district court properly granted King compensatory damages for specific,\nactual injuries he suffered that “cannot be easily quantified.” King VI, 2013 WL 2102655, at *3.\nThe district court expressly noted that “[d]amages may not be awarded based on the abstract\nvalue or importance of the constitutional right that was violated.” Id. Instead, the district court\nfocused on the particular circumstances of King’s case and the harms he suffered, explaining that\n“King has testified to an injury, i.e., the negative impact on his ability to obtain affidavits or\ndeclarations concerning prisoner property violations for use in the Cain litigation.”2 Like the\ncourts in City of Watseka and Kerman, the district court invoked the concept of presumed\ndamages, and was careful to focus on approximating the value of the harm King actually suffered\non the facts of this case, not on the abstract value or importance of his First Amendment rights.\n\n         As for the amount of the damages the district court awarded, “[a] trial court’s finding of\nfact on the issue of compensatory damages is not reversible error unless it manifests plain\ninjustice, or is so grossly excessive as to be clearly erroneous.” Moorer v. Baptist Mem’l Health\nCare Sys., 398 F.3d 469, 485 (6th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Smith\nv. Heath, 691 F.2d 220, 226 (6th Cir. 1982). The district court concluded, following a bench\ntrial, that King should be awarded presumed damages of $5 per day spent at the more restrictive\nprison facility. “No formula exists to determine with precision compensatory damages. The\n\n\n         2\n           While King did not provide evidence to quantify the extent to which his elevated security classification\nprevented him from collecting affidavits for the Cain litigation, his testimony supports the conclusion that he was\nactually impeded in his efforts to exercise his First Amendment rights. See R. 171 (Trial Tr. at 96–102) (Page ID\n#1528–34). In addition, King has not provided evidence to isolate which differences between the two facilities\nresulted from the security level increase as opposed to normal variance between different facilities. However, as a\nlogical matter, at least a portion of the additional restrictions at Chippewa must have been attributable to the increase\nin security classification: if there were truly no substantive difference between security levels, the MDOC would\nhave no reason to create distinct security level classifications. And King should not be faulted for failing to quantify\nthe extent of an injury that merits presumed damages because it is difficult to measure. See Parrish, 800 F.2d at\n606–07. Thus, at least part of King’s constitutional injury suffered after his transfer to Chippewa is attributable to\nthe retaliatory increase in his security level.\n\fNo. 13-1766                         King v. Zamiara et al.                     Page 10\n\namount is left to the sound discretion of the fact finder.” Smith, 691 F.2d at 227 (affirming a\ncompensatory damages award of $5,000 to a plaintiff alleging that his apartment was\nunconstitutionally searched). The award calculated by the district court is not disproportionate to\ncompensatory damages awarded to other prisoners who suffered retaliation after exercising their\nFirst Amendment rights. See Bell v. Johnson, 404 F.3d 997, 999, 1003 (6th Cir. 2005). King\nmakes much of Trobaugh v. Hall, 176 F.3d 1087 (8th Cir. 1999), an Eighth Circuit case that\nrecommended approximately $100 per day as an appropriate compensatory award for the\ndeprivation of First Amendment rights resulting from a higher security classification. Id. at\n1088–89.      However, the Trobaugh court considered different procedural and factual\ncircumstances than those King presents. In that case, the reviewing court disturbed the district\ncourt’s judgment only because the nominal award of $1 was “patently insufficient to compensate\nTrobaugh for the injury he suffered by being placed in segregation in retaliation for exercising a\nconstitutional right.” Id. at 1088–89. By contrast, King received a substantial compensatory\naward for a less severe retaliatory action: King was transferred to the general population at a\nmore restrictive facility, where he still had at least limited opportunities to exercise his First\nAmendment rights and interact with other prisoners, as opposed to segregation, which\ncompletely extinguishes those rights. According appropriate deference to the district court’s\nexercise of discretion, we cannot say that the compensatory award was an abuse of discretion.\nTherefore, we affirm the district court’s grant of compensatory damages in the amount of $1,475.\n\n                                  III. PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\n       Punitive damages are appropriate in a § 1983 action “when the defendant’s conduct is\nshown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous\nindifference to the federally protected rights of others.” Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983).\nBecause punitive damages are a mechanism for punishing the defendant for “willful or malicious\nconduct,” they may be granted “only on a showing of the requisite intent.” Stachura, 477 U.S. at\n306 n.9. We review a decision to deny punitive damages for abuse of discretion. Cooper Indus.,\nInc. v. Leatherman Tool Grp., Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 432–33 (2001).\n\n       The district court interpreted our opinion in King V, 680 F.3d 686 (6th Cir. 2012),\nnarrowly and concluded that our holding did not “require[] a finding that these Defendants were\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v. Zamiara et al.                       Page 11\n\nmotivated by evil motive or intent, or callous indifference to King’s protected rights.” King VI,\n2013 WL 2102655, at *4. Accordingly, the district court concluded that the “[d]efendants’\nconduct in this case does not meet the standard for awarding punitive damages.” Id. In doing so,\nthe district court misapplied the governing legal standard. Although punitive damages may be\navailable upon a showing of “evil motive or intent” or “callous indifference,” see Smith, 461\nU.S. at 56, punitive damages are also appropriate when a defendant’s action involves even\nreckless disregard of the plaintiff’s rights. Id. at 51 (“[R]eckless or callous disregard for the\nplaintiff’s rights, as well as intentional violations of federal law, should be sufficient to trigger a\njury’s consideration of the appropriateness of punitive damages.”); see also Searles, 251 F.3d at\n880 (concluding that a punitive damages award would have been appropriate, had the jury been\nproperly instructed, because “a reasonable jury could find from th[e] evidence that defendant’s\nactions were in reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights”). When a defendant retaliates against a\nplaintiff’s exercise of his First Amendment rights, the defendant necessarily acts with the\npurpose of infringing upon the plaintiff’s federally protected rights. See Thaddeus-X v. Blatter,\n175 F.3d 378, 394 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (requiring a plaintiff to show, as an element of a\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim, that the defendant’s “adverse action was motivated at least in\npart by the plaintiff’s protected conduct”). Thus, a defendant who has been found liable for First\nAmendment retaliation has engaged in conduct that warrants consideration of an award of\npunitive damages. By concluding that the defendants did not engage in conduct that “meet[s] the\nstandard for awarding punitive damages,” the district court erred in applying the governing legal\nstandard and abused its discretion. Accordingly, we believe that remand is warranted.\n\n       On remand, the district court is permitted to consider whether or not to award King\npunitive damages. “[A] key feature of punitive damages [is] that they are never awarded as of\nright, no matter how egregious the defendant’s conduct.” Smith, 461 U.S. at 52. Rather, once\nthe plaintiff proves that the defendant’s conduct triggers consideration of punitive damages, the\nfactfinder makes the “discretionary moral judgment” whether or not to award punitive damages.\nId. In exercising his discretion, the factfinder should consider that “[t]he purpose of punitive\ndamages is to punish the defendant for his willful or malicious conduct and to deter others from\nsimilar behavior.” Stachura, 477 U.S. at 306 n.9 (emphasis added).\n\fNo. 13-1766                              King v. Zamiara et al.                          Page 12\n\n        The district court should bear in mind that we have determined that Wells, at least,\ninflicted harm on King with “animus” against his protected activities. King V, 680 F.3d at 702.\nMoreover, all of the defendants purposefully deprived King of his fundamental constitutional\nrights by assisting in his transfer with the intention to retaliate. In addition, nothing in the record\nsuggests that a punitive damages award would not have its intended deterrent effect upon the\ndefendants.3 Cf. Royal v. Kautzky, 375 F.3d 720, 725 (8th Cir. 2004) (concluding that the\ndeterrent purposes of a punitive damages award would not be served because the individual\ndefendant had already retired). Indeed, the deterrent value of punitive damages is particularly\nimportant under these circumstances because a prisoner may not seek to deter prison officials\nfrom violating his rights through the ordinary mechanism of compensatory damages. With this\nguidance, we reverse the district court’s denial of punitive damages and remand with instructions\nto the district court to exercise its discretion in considering whether to make an award of punitive\ndamages.\n\n                                      IV. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\n        We utilize a number of different standards when reviewing a district court’s decision to\ngrant or deny a permanent injunction:              “Factual findings are reviewed under the clearly\nerroneous standard, legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, and the scope of injunctive relief is\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion.”           Worldwide Basketball & Sport Tours, Inc. v. Nat’l\nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, 388 F.3d 955, 958 (6th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nKing argues that the court should enter an injunction requiring MDOC to remove certain\ndocuments from his file because they violate his due-process rights. Injunctive relief on this\nbasis is unwarranted, however, because we have found no due-process violation. In King I, 150\nF. App’x 485, 496–97 (6th Cir. 2005), we affirmed the district court’s dismissal of King’s due-\nprocess claim because he failed to file an objection to the magistrate judge’s recommendation\nthat summary judgment be granted in favor of the prison officials on the due-process claim.\nBecause the due-process claim is not at issue in this suit, we may not grant injunctive relief to\nremedy an alleged due-process violation. See De Beers Consol. Mines, Ltd. v. United States,\n325 U.S. 212, 220 (1945). As the district court correctly noted, the appropriate injunctive\n\n        3\n         We stress, however, that the district court should assess the actions of each defendant individually in\ndetermining whether punitive damages are warranted as to each defendant.\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v. Zamiara et al.                       Page 13\n\nremedy for the retaliatory increase in King’s security level is restoration to the correct security\nlevel. King has already been transferred back to a Level II prison facility. R. 1 (Compl. ¶ 50).\nTherefore, we affirm the district court’s denial of injunctive relief.\n\n                                      V. ATTORNEY FEES\n\n       In § 1983 actions, the court may, in its discretion, award a reasonable attorney fee to the\nprevailing party. 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). However, the PLRA limits the attorney fee to 150\npercent of the money judgment. Riley v. Kurtz, 361 F.3d 906, 911 (6th Cir. 2004); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(d)(2). The district court awarded attorney fees in the amount of $2,212.50, which\nrepresented 150 percent of the monetary damages award. We review a district court’s grant of\nattorney fees for abuse of discretion. Riley, 361 F.3d at 910. The district court properly applied\nthe statute to calculate the appropriate award of attorney fees. However, because we hold that\nthe district court abused its discretion in denying punitive damages, the district court should\nrecalculate the appropriate cap on attorney fees on remand.\n\n       Finally, the district court misapplied the PLRA’s attorney fees provision when it failed to\ncharge a portion of the attorney fees against King’s judgment.              The PLRA provides that\n“[w]henever a monetary judgment is awarded . . . a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25\npercent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded against the defendant.”\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(2).      The district court’s failure properly to apply pertinent statutory\nlanguage when calculating an award of attorney’s fees is an abuse of discretion. See Johnson v.\nBreeden, 280 F.3d 1308, 1326–27 (11th Cir. 2002) (finding an abuse of discretion when the\ndistrict court ignored the limitations imposed by §1997e(d)(1)(A) and instead used the “lodestar\nmethod” to calculate attorney fees). Neither the statute nor our cases provide guidance to assist\ndistrict courts in determining the appropriate percentage.               However, some courts have\ndetermined that requiring plaintiffs to pay as little as $1 in attorney fees from the judgment is\nappropriate. See Murphy v. Gilman, Nos. 03-145, 04-103, 2008 WL 2139611, at *2 (W.D. Mich.\nMay 20, 2008); Siggers-El v. Barlow, 433 F. Supp. 2d 811, 822–23 (E.D. Mich. 2006). On\nremand, if the district court determines that an award of punitive damages is appropriate, we\ninstruct the district court to exercise its discretion to apply some percentage of the judgment, not\nto exceed 25 percent, to attorney fees.\n\fNo. 13-1766                        King v. Zamiara et al.                   Page 14\n\n                                     VI. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court’s judgment and REMAND\nwith instructions to award damages and fees consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

In this appeal, we decide whether 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(e), a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), precludes prisoners from\nasserting meritorious § 1983 claims alleging First Amendment violations merely because those\nviolations did not also cause physical harm. After Kevin King, an inmate held by the Michigan\n\n         *\n         The Honorable Sandra S. Beckwith, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting\nby designation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        1\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v. Zamiara et al.                       Page 2\n\nDepartment of Corrections (“MDOC”), participated in a class-action lawsuit designed to\nchallenge personal property policies at MDOC facilities (the “Cain litigation”), prison officials\ntransferred him to a prison with a higher security classification and more restrictive conditions.\nKing filed suit against Chuck Zamiara, Curtis Chaffee, Sharon Wells, and other prison officials\n(the “prison officials”) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We have previously held that Zamiara, Chaffee,\nand Wells are liable for retaliating against King for his First Amendment-protected conduct,\nnamely participating in the Cain litigation and assisting other petitioners to file grievances. After\nwe remanded the case back to the district court, the court granted compensatory damages and\nawarded attorney fees, but denied punitive damages and injunctive relief. Both parties appealed.\nFor the following reasons, we VACATE the district court’s judgment and REMAND for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Our previous opinions thoroughly discuss the facts of this case. See King v. Zamiara,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"800677\"><a href=\"/opinion/800677/king-v-zamiara/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 688–94 (6th Cir. 2012) (“King V”). As pertinent to this appeal, the facts are as\nfollows: Kevin King was incarcerated in 1983 after his conviction for first-degree murder. As\nof November 1999, King was housed in the Conklin Unit at Brooks Correctional Facility\n(“Brooks”), a Level II facility. On April 20, 2000, Sharon Wells, the Resident Unit Manager of\nConklin Unit, requested that King be transferred to another unit because he was “becoming\nincreasingly more powerful in the eyes of the prisoners in Conklin Unit.” R. 11-2 (Wells Memo)\n(Page ID #132).     Curtis Chaffee, the transfer coordinator at Brooks, requested that Chuck\nZamiara, an MDOC classification specialist, approve a transfer to another Level II facility. R.\n130-3 (Chaffee/Zamiara Email) (Page ID #788). After consulting with Classification Director\nNick Ludwick, Zamiara instead approved a transfer to a Level III facility because King was\n“preceived [sic] as a disruptive prisoner who is manipulating others to create unrest.” Id. The\nsecurity screen entered into King’s file was hand-edited to replace a note that King was\n“manageable in Level II” with a note scoring him at Level III. R. 130-3 (Chaffee Screen) (Page\nID #784). King was transferred to Chippewa Correctional Facility (“Chippewa”), a Level III\nfacility, on May 17, 2000.\n\fNo. 13-1766                           King v. Zamiara et al.                     Page 3\n\n        A Level III facility operates under more heightened security procedures than a Level II\nfacility. Although the Warden testified that “[t]here’s very little difference” between the two\nsecurity levels and that each facility sets its own schedules and programming, R. 171 (Trial Tr. I\nat 125–26) (Page ID #1557–58), another prison official testified that there were differences\nbetween Level II and Level III facilities in terms of visitation, programming, and activities. R.\n172 (Trial Tr. II at 272–74) (Page ID #1706–08).           In addition, King testified to several\nsubstantial differences between the two facilities.      King explained that his access to other\nprisoners during “yard time” and free time in the day rooms was significantly restricted at the\nLevel III facility. He was inhibited from “communicat[ing] with who [he] wanted to” because he\nwas unable to move freely between common spaces. R. 171 (Trial Tr. I at 92–97) (Page ID\n#1524–29). The movement restrictions in Level III affected King’s ability to assist with the Cain\nlitigation: “I was less able to get affidavits, declarations to discover what was going on with the\ndepartment up there at the time because I was pretty much secluded. I had to move with the\nmasses that they chose that I move with.” Id. at 98 (Page ID #1530). King continually objected\nto his Level III classification, and in February 2001 he was approved for a transfer to Thumb\nCorrectional Facility, a Level II facility.\n\n        On July 26, 2002, King filed a pro se complaint alleging First Amendment retaliation\nagainst several MDOC employees. R. 1 (Compl.) (Page ID #1–18). The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that King had not engaged in any form\nof protected conduct. R. 30 (D. Ct.

COMPENSATORY DAMAGES\n\nA. Applicability of § 1997e(e) to First Amendment Claims\n\n        The district court granted a compensatory-damages award to King because the retaliatory\nincrease in his security level deprived him of his First Amendment right to participate in the Cain\nlitigation. The PLRA provides that “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner\nconfined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered\nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). The\napplicability of this provision to claims alleging First Amendment deprivations has been a matter\nof significant debate. Many circuits, following common-law tort principles1, conclude that First\nAmendment claims that do not allege physical injury necessarily allege compensable injury only\n\n        1\n         At common law, a claim for compensatory damages must allege actual injury in the form of bodily or\nemotional harm.

Page 6\n\nmental, emotional, or physical injury that might also arise from the deprivation, and that\n§ 1997e(e) does not bar all relief for injuries to First Amendment rights.\n\n       When interpreting a statute, we begin with the plain meaning of the statutory language.\nWalker v. Bain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774061\"><a href=\"/opinion/774061/william-h-walker-jr-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-99-2004-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (6th Cir. 2001). “Every word in the statute is presumed to\nhave meaning, and we must give effect to all the words to avoid an interpretation which would\nrender words superfluous or redundant.” Id. at 667. The majority of circuits embrace a broad\nview of the PLRA’s statutory language and conclude that, regardless of the underlying\nconstitutional violation, if the plaintiff fails to allege physical injury, § 1997e(e) bars\ncompensatory damages. See, e.g., Geiger, 404 F.3d at 374–75. However, this interpretation\ndoes not accord with the statutory language: The statute provides that a prisoner may not bring a\ncivil action for mental or emotional injury unless he has also suffered a physical injury.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). It says nothing about claims brought to redress constitutional injuries,\nwhich are distinct from mental and emotional injuries. See Rowe, 196 F.3d at 781–82 (“A\nprisoner is entitled to judicial relief for a violation of his First Amendment rights aside from any\nphysical, mental, or emotional injury he may have sustained.”); Canell, 143 F.3d at 1213 (same).\nWere we to construe § 1997e(e) as the majority of courts have done, thereby grafting a physical-\ninjury requirement onto claims that allege First Amendment violations as the injury, the phrase\n“for mental or emotional injury” would be rendered superfluous. See Amaker v. Haponik, No. 98\nCIV 2663, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">76798</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 1999). Therefore, the plain language of the\nstatute does not bar claims for constitutional injury that do not also involve physical injury. See\nRobinson, 170 F.3d at 748 (Posner, J.) (“It would be a serious mistake to interpret section\n1997e(e) to require a showing of physical injury in all prisoner civil rights suits. The domain of\nthe statute is limited to suits in which mental or emotional injury is claimed.”)\n\n       Accordingly, we hold that § 1997e(e) does not foreclose claims that allege violations of\nFirst Amendment-protected rights as injuries.       King’s claim alleges a constitutional injury\ndistinct from any mental or emotional injury he might have suffered: He claims that he was\nplaced in a higher security facility for approximately ten months in retaliation for his exercise of\nhis First Amendment rights. R. 1 (Compl. ¶ 50) (Page ID #8). While at the more secure facility,\nKing suffered infringements on his First Amendment rights because additional restrictions on his\n\fNo. 13-1766                            King v. Zamiara et al.                      Page 7\n\nmovements hindered his attempts to collect affidavits and declarations from other prisoners to\nassist in the Cain litigation. R. 171 (Trial Tr. I at 98) (Page ID #1530). Because King’s claim is\nnot “for mental or emotional injury,” § 1997e(e) does not preclude his claim merely because he\ndoes not also claim physical injury.\n\nB. Compensatory Damages Award\n\n       King can recover compensatory damages for the violation of his First Amendment rights\nin this case. A plaintiff who alleges the violation of a constitutional right is not entitled to\ncompensatory damages unless he can prove actual injury caused by the violation.

As an example of such a situation, the Supreme Court “cited with\napproval the long line of cases which uphold money damages as compensation for persons\ndeprived of their right to vote.” Walje v.

When it is\ndifficult to quantify precisely the damages caused by that injury, presumed damages may be\nawarded, but “[t]he award must focus on the real injury sustained and not on either the abstract\nvalue of the constitutional right at issue, see Carey, or the importance of the right in our system\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v.

Id. at 1548, 1559. In addition to\nlost revenues, IPAC alleged less readily quantifiable injuries including “(1) its inability to recruit\nnew members in Watseka, (2) its inability to disseminate its views to Watseka residents, and (3)\nits inability to encourage Watseka citizens to support IPAC positions on various issues by\nsigning petitions or contacting local legislators.” Id. at 1558. Although “the monetary value of\nthe particular injury [was] difficult to ascertain,” the Seventh Circuit upheld the district court’s\ndamages award because the court’s “order ma[d]e[] it clear that [the court] was awarding IPAC\ndamages because Watseka ‘prevented [IPAC] from exercising its First Amendment rights in this\ncase;’ [the court] did not base the award on any abstract value of the constitutional right.” Id. at\n1559. The Seventh Circuit explained that the award was based on “specific compensable, non-\nabstract harm to IPAC . . . [as] seen from the specific injuries alleged by IPAC,” and concluded\nthat the “[t]he type of particular injury for which [the district court] awarded IPAC $5,000 is\nindistinguishable from the particular injury for which the Court approved compensatory damages\nin Nixon v. Herndon.” Id.\n\n       Similarly, in Kerman v. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3161\"><a href=\"/opinion/3161/kerman-v-city-of-new-york-concurrence/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit\nheld that the district court erred in not instructing the jury that it could award the plaintiff\ncompensatory damages for the loss of liberty he suffered as a result of the violation of his Fourth\nAmendment rights. Id. at 129. The Second Circuit explained that “the Supreme Court in\nStachura, in disapproving the instructions that would have allowed an award based on the\nabstract societal value of constitutional protections, expressly distinguished that impermissible\n\fNo. 13-1766                                 King v. Zamiara et al.                                Page 9\n\nabstraction from the theory that is pertinent here, to wit, the traditionally permissible concept of\n‘presumed damages.’” Id. at 130. The court then continued that “[t]he present case does not\ninvolve . . . an attempt to vindicate an abstract societal interest. Rather, it involves an anything-\nbut-abstract physical detention. And although a given person’s loss of time may be difficult to\nevaluate in terms of dollars, his loss of liberty is not just ‘virtually certain’ to occur; it is\ninseparable from the detention itself.” Id.\n\n         In this case, the district court properly granted King compensatory damages for specific,\nactual injuries he suffered that “cannot be easily quantified.” King VI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2102655</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3.\nThe district court expressly noted that “[d]amages may not be awarded based on the abstract\nvalue or importance of the constitutional right that was violated.” Id. Instead, the district court\nfocused on the particular circumstances of King’s case and the harms he suffered, explaining that\n“King has testified to an injury, i.e., the negative impact on his ability to obtain affidavits or\ndeclarations concerning prisoner property violations for use in the Cain litigation.”2 Like the\ncourts in City of Watseka and Kerman, the district court invoked the concept of presumed\ndamages, and was careful to focus on approximating the value of the harm King actually suffered\non the facts of this case, not on the abstract value or importance of his First Amendment rights.\n\n         As for the amount of the damages the district court awarded, “[a] trial court’s finding of\nfact on the issue of compensatory damages is not reversible error unless it manifests plain\ninjustice, or is so grossly excessive as to be clearly erroneous.” Moorer v.

The\n\n\n         2\n           While King did not provide evidence to quantify the extent to which his elevated security classification\nprevented him from collecting affidavits for the Cain litigation, his testimony supports the conclusion that he was\nactually impeded in his efforts to exercise his First Amendment rights. See R. 171 (Trial Tr. at 96–102) (Page ID\n#1528–34). In addition, King has not provided evidence to isolate which differences between the two facilities\nresulted from the security level increase as opposed to normal variance between different facilities. However, as a\nlogical matter, at least a portion of the additional restrictions at Chippewa must have been attributable to the increase\nin security classification: if there were truly no substantive difference between security levels, the MDOC would\nhave no reason to create distinct security level classifications. And King should not be faulted for failing to quantify\nthe extent of an injury that merits presumed damages because it is difficult to measure. See Parrish, 800 F.2d at\n606–07. Thus, at least part of King’s constitutional injury suffered after his transfer to Chippewa is attributable to\nthe retaliatory increase in his security level.\n\fNo. 13-1766                         King v.

Id. at\n1088–89.      However, the Trobaugh court considered different procedural and factual\ncircumstances than those King presents. In that case, the reviewing court disturbed the district\ncourt’s judgment only because the nominal award of $1 was “patently insufficient to compensate\nTrobaugh for the injury he suffered by being placed in segregation in retaliation for exercising a\nconstitutional right.” Id. at 1088–89. By contrast, King received a substantial compensatory\naward for a less severe retaliatory action: King was transferred to the general population at a\nmore restrictive facility, where he still had at least limited opportunities to exercise his First\nAmendment rights and interact with other prisoners, as opposed to segregation, which\ncompletely extinguishes those rights. According appropriate deference to the district court’s\nexercise of discretion, we cannot say that the compensatory award was an abuse of discretion.\nTherefore, we affirm the district court’s grant of compensatory damages in the amount of $1,475.\n\n                                  III. PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\n       Punitive damages are appropriate in a § 1983 action “when the defendant’s conduct is\nshown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous\nindifference to the federally protected rights of others.” Smith v. Wade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110915\"><a href=\"/opinion/110915/smith-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (1983).\nBecause punitive damages are a mechanism for punishing the defendant for “willful or malicious\nconduct,” they may be granted “only on a showing of the requisite intent.” Stachura, 477 U.S. at\n306 n.9. We review a decision to deny punitive damages for abuse of discretion. Cooper Indus.,\nInc. v. Leatherman Tool Grp., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118424\"><a href=\"/opinion/118424/cooper-industries-inc-v-leatherman-tool-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432–33 (2001).\n\n       The district court interpreted our opinion in King V, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"800677\"><a href=\"/opinion/800677/king-v-zamiara/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2012),\nnarrowly and concluded that our holding did not “require[] a finding that these Defendants were\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v. Zamiara et al.                       Page 11\n\nmotivated by evil motive or intent, or callous indifference to King’s protected rights.” King VI,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2102655</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. Accordingly, the district court concluded that the “[d]efendants’\nconduct in this case does not meet the standard for awarding punitive damages.” Id. In doing so,\nthe district court misapplied the governing legal standard. Although punitive damages may be\navailable upon a showing of “evil motive or intent” or “callous indifference,” see Smith, 461\nU.S. at 56, punitive damages are also appropriate when a defendant’s action involves even\nreckless disregard of the plaintiff’s rights. Id. at 51 (“[R]eckless or callous disregard for the\nplaintiff’s rights, as well as intentional violations of federal law, should be sufficient to trigger a\njury’s consideration of the appropriateness of punitive damages.”); see also Searles, 251 F.3d at\n880 (concluding that a punitive damages award would have been appropriate, had the jury been\nproperly instructed, because “a reasonable jury could find from th[e] evidence that defendant’s\nactions were in reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights”). When a defendant retaliates against a\nplaintiff’s exercise of his First Amendment rights, the defendant necessarily acts with the\npurpose of infringing upon the plaintiff’s federally protected rights. See Thaddeus-X v. Blatter,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763587\"><a href=\"/opinion/763587/thaddeus-x-and-earnest-bell-jr-v-blatter/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (requiring a plaintiff to show, as an element of a\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim, that the defendant’s “adverse action was motivated at least in\npart by the plaintiff’s protected conduct”). Thus, a defendant who has been found liable for First\nAmendment retaliation has engaged in conduct that warrants consideration of an award of\npunitive damages. By concluding that the defendants did not engage in conduct that “meet[s] the\nstandard for awarding punitive damages,” the district court erred in applying the governing legal\nstandard and abused its discretion. Accordingly, we believe that remand is warranted.\n\n       On remand, the district court is permitted to consider whether or not to award King\npunitive damages. “[A] key feature of punitive damages [is] that they are never awarded as of\nright, no matter how egregious the defendant’s conduct.” Smith, 461 U.S. at 52. Rather, once\nthe plaintiff proves that the defendant’s conduct triggers consideration of punitive damages, the\nfactfinder makes the “discretionary moral judgment” whether or not to award punitive damages.\nId. In exercising his discretion, the factfinder should consider that “[t]he purpose of punitive\ndamages is to punish the defendant for his willful or malicious conduct and to deter others from\nsimilar behavior.” Stachura, 477 U.S. at 306 n.9 (emphasis added).\n\fNo. 13-1766                              King v. Zamiara et al.                          Page 12\n\n        The district court should bear in mind that we have determined that Wells, at least,\ninflicted harm on King with “animus” against his protected activities. King V, 680 F.3d at 702.\nMoreover, all of the defendants purposefully deprived King of his fundamental constitutional\nrights by assisting in his transfer with the intention to retaliate. In addition, nothing in the record\nsuggests that a punitive damages award would not have its intended deterrent effect upon the\ndefendants.3 Cf. Royal v. Kautzky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786942\"><a href=\"/opinion/786942/jeffery-r-royal-v-walter-kautzky-lowell-brandt-carole-clemens-paul-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (8th Cir. 2004) (concluding that the\ndeterrent purposes of a punitive damages award would not be served because the individual\ndefendant had already retired). Indeed, the deterrent value of punitive damages is particularly\nimportant under these circumstances because a prisoner may not seek to deter prison officials\nfrom violating his rights through the ordinary mechanism of compensatory damages. With this\nguidance, we reverse the district court’s denial of punitive damages and remand with instructions\nto the district court to exercise its discretion in considering whether to make an award of punitive\ndamages.\n\n                                      IV. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\n        We utilize a number of different standards when reviewing a district court’s decision to\ngrant or deny a permanent injunction:              “Factual findings are reviewed under the clearly\nerroneous standard, legal conclusions are reviewed de novo, and the scope of injunctive relief is\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion.”           Worldwide Basketball & Sport Tours, Inc. v. Nat’l\nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788317\"><a href=\"/opinion/788317/worldwide-basketball-and-sport-tours-inc-v-national-collegiate-athletic/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 958 (6th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nKing argues that the court should enter an injunction requiring MDOC to remove certain\ndocuments from his file because they violate his due-process rights. Injunctive relief on this\nbasis is unwarranted, however, because we have found no due-process violation. In King I, 150\nF. App’x 485, 496–97 (6th Cir. 2005), we affirmed the district court’s dismissal of King’s due-\nprocess claim because he failed to file an objection to the magistrate judge’s recommendation\nthat summary judgment be granted in favor of the prison officials on the due-process claim.\nBecause the due-process claim is not at issue in this suit, we may not grant injunctive relief to\nremedy an alleged due-process violation. See De Beers Consol. Mines, Ltd. v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104138\"><a href=\"/opinion/104138/de-beers-consol-mines-ltd-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 220 (1945). As the district court correctly noted, the appropriate injunctive\n\n        3\n         We stress, however, that the district court should assess the actions of each defendant individually in\ndetermining whether punitive damages are warranted as to each defendant.\n\fNo. 13-1766                          King v. Zamiara et al.                       Page 13\n\nremedy for the retaliatory increase in King’s security level is restoration to the correct security\nlevel. King has already been transferred back to a Level II prison facility. R. 1 (Compl. ¶ 50).\nTherefore, we affirm the district court’s denial of injunctive relief.\n\n                                      V. ATTORNEY FEES\n\n       In § 1983 actions, the court may, in its discretion, award a reasonable attorney fee to the\nprevailing party. 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). However, the PLRA limits the attorney fee to 150\npercent of the money judgment. Riley v. Kurtz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785488\"><a href=\"/opinion/785488/jimmie-lee-riley-v-david-t-kurtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 911 (6th Cir. 2004); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(d)(2). The district court awarded attorney fees in the amount of $2,212.50, which\nrepresented 150 percent of the monetary damages award. We review a district court’s grant of\nattorney fees for abuse of discretion. Riley, 361 F.3d at 910. The district court properly applied\nthe statute to calculate the appropriate award of attorney fees. However, because we hold that\nthe district court abused its discretion in denying punitive damages, the district court should\nrecalculate the appropriate cap on attorney fees on remand.\n\n       Finally, the district court misapplied the PLRA’s attorney fees provision when it failed to\ncharge a portion of the attorney fees against King’s judgment.              The PLRA provides that\n“[w]henever a monetary judgment is awarded . . . a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25\npercent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney’s fees awarded against the defendant.”\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(2).      The district court’s failure properly to apply pertinent statutory\nlanguage when calculating an award of attorney’s fees is an abuse of discretion. See Johnson v.\nBreeden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75710\"><a href=\"/opinion/75710/ernest-d-johnson-v-brian-breeden/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1326–27 (11th Cir. 2002) (finding an abuse of discretion when the\ndistrict court ignored the limitations imposed by §1997e(d)(1)(A) and instead used the “lodestar\nmethod” to calculate attorney fees). Neither the statute nor our cases provide guidance to assist\ndistrict courts in determining the appropriate percentage.               However, some courts have\ndetermined that requiring plaintiffs to pay as little as $1 in attorney fees from the judgment is\nappropriate. See Murphy v. Gilman, Nos. 03-145, 04-103, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2139611</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (W.D.

On\nremand, if the district court determines that an award of punitive damages is appropriate, we\ninstruct the district court to exercise its discretion to apply some percentage of the judgment, not\nto exceed 25 percent, to attorney fees.\n\fNo. 13-1766                        King v. Zamiara et al.                   Page 14\n\n                                     VI. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court’s judgment and REMAND\nwith instructions to award damages and fees consistent with this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
