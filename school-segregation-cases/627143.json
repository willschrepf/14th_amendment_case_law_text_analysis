Appellees are G.J. Branker,\n\nwarden    of    Central     Prison,   and        Robert    C.       Lewis,       director   of\n\nprisons for the North Carolina Department of Prisons.                               Williams\n\nsued appellees in their official capacities.                         The district court\n\ngranted       appellees’    motion    for    judgment          on    the    pleadings       and\n\ndismissed      Williams’s     suit.      For      the     reasons      that       follow,   we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n                                            I.\n\n                                            A.\n\n      The following facts are taken from Williams’ Third Amended\n\nComplaint.        For purposes of our review, we assume them to be\n\ntrue.     See McVey v. Stacey, 157 F.3d 271, 274 (4th Cir. 1998).\n\n      In 1993, at the age of 16, Williams began serving a 20-year\n\nprison     sentence     in    facilities          run     by    the        North     Carolina\n\nDepartment        of       Corrections          (“DOC”).               Throughout           his\n\nincarceration, Williams has suffered from severe mental illness\n\nand     was    diagnosed     with,    among        other        disorders,         psychotic\n\n                                            3\n\fdisorder,     schizophrenia,        borderline       personality    disorder,    and\n\nintermittent explosive disorder.                Williams’s mental illness has\n\nmanifested itself through, inter alia, behavioral outbursts as\n\nwell as “thoughts of suicide [and the] ingesting or inserting\n\n[of] foreign bodies[] and severe self lacerations.”                         J.A. 7.\n\n“He has [had] numerous stays in an inpatient psychiatric setting\n\ndue to his extensive history of ingesting or inserting foreign\n\nbodies, and severe self lacerations that have required emergency\n\nmedical attention.”        Id.\n\n       As a result of his mental illness and its manifestations,\n\nat    the   time   of    his   complaint        in   2010,   Williams     had   spent\n\napproximately      10     years     of   his    incarceration      in    “segregated\n\nconfinement.”           J.A.   8.        Williams    described     his    segregated\n\nconfinement as follows:\n\n       [A] small cell whose dimensions are approximately\n       twelve feet by six feet.      The floor, walls, and\n       ceiling of the cell are concrete.   There is a narrow\n       window that looks out only on the hallway outside the\n       cell.   There is a slot through which food trays and\n       other materials may be passed, and through which\n       [Williams] must extend his hands to be cuffed before\n       the steel door is opened.\n\nId.    Beyond the spartan nature of his confinement, Williams was\n\nalso subject to several lifestyle restrictions.                         For example,\n\nWilliams was only “allowed to leave his cell for one hour on\n\nfive days of each week”; was “kept indoors constantly” and has\n\nnot had “outdoor recreation [for] several years”; was allowed\n\n\n                                            4\n\fminimal contact with other inmates; could not participate in\n\nreligious, work, rehabilitative, or other activities; and was\n\nnot   allowed     “access     to     a   television,       and    ha[d]    very   limited\n\naccess to reading materials.”                   J.A. 8-9.        In addition to these\n\nrestrictions, Williams was subject to additional punishment at\n\ntimes, including being placed in “restraints in a concrete cell\n\nalone     for    four    hour      periods[,]        caus[ing]      pain    and     mental\n\ndistress.”       J.A. 9.\n\n                                               B.\n\n        Williams brought suit against appellees under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983,     claiming       that       “[i]nstead        of    [receiving]       effective\n\ntreatment for his mental illness” he was “being punished with\n\natypical and significant hardships over and above those imposed\n\nunder    his     sentence.”         J.A.    8.       Williams     alleged    that    these\n\nhardships were a result of policies created and implemented by\n\nappellees and were in violation of his right under the Eighth\n\nAmendment to be provided with adequate medical care and humane\n\nconditions of confinement.                 Specifically, Williams alleged that\n\n“[t]he social isolation, arbitrary punishments, lack of exercise\n\nand   other      conditions     of       the    confinement       imposed    on   him   by\n\npolicies created and maintained by [appellees] have caused [him]\n\nserious and unnecessary pain and suffering.”                      J.A. 10.\n\n      As Williams described it, his mental illness caused him to\n\nact   out,      which   in   turn    led       to   additional     restrictions.        He\n\n                                               5\n\falleges     the    existence    of     a    pernicious        circle.        As     these\n\nrestrictions       mounted,     they       aggravated       his    mental        illness,\n\ncausing him to misbehave further.                 Williams was “told he will be\n\nallowed     additional       privileges         when   he    is    able     to    remain\n\ninfraction free for long periods of time, yet the effect of [the\n\nrestrictions] effectively prevents him from remaining infraction\n\nfree.”       Id.        Williams     has        alleged     that   this     cycle      was\n\nexacerbated       by   the   fact    that       “[c]orrectional     staff        are   not\n\ntrained in the identification and management of the mentally\n\nill.      They assume that Plaintiff is willfully disobedient or\n\ndisruptive, when in fact his behavior is at times beyond his\n\ncontrol.”    Id.       As to the appellees, Williams further alleged:\n\n       As trained and experienced corrections professionals,\n       [appellees] are aware of the dangers and risks to\n       [Williams] caused by their policies of long term\n       confinement and the cruel and unusual conditions\n       imposed upon him.      Regardless of this knowledge,\n       [appellees] have acted with deliberate indifference to\n       his right to be free from unnecessary suffering and\n       mental and physical harm.\n\nId.\n\n       Williams sought a declaration that his treatment violated\n\nthe Eighth Amendment and an injunction barring DOC officials and\n\nemployees from treating Williams in a similar fashion in the\n\nfuture.\n\n       Appellees filed an answer with various exhibits attached,\n\nand moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule\n\n\n                                            6\n\fof Civil Procedure 12(c). 1             The district court granted appellees’\n\nmotion,    concluding       that       “although         [Williams’s]    conditions      of\n\nconfinement       are    unpleasant,          they     do   not    deprive   Williams    of\n\nbasic human needs.”              J.A. 182.             In its opinion, the district\n\ncourt    relied    on     some    of    the      exhibits     to    appellees’   answer,\n\nincluding portions of the DOC Policy and Procedure Manual and\n\nselect reports from Williams’s inmate file regarding his mental\n\nhealth status.          In doing so, however, the district court did not\n\nindicate that it was converting appellees’ motion for judgment\n\non the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                              II.\n\n        On appeal, Williams argues that the district erred both\n\nprocedurally and substantively in granting appellees’ motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings.                    Williams argues that the district\n\ncourt     erred     procedurally            in       considering     exhibits    to     the\n\nappellees’ answer, thereby constructively converting appellees’\n\nRule 12(c) motion into a Rule 56 summary judgment motion without\n\ngiving Williams notice or a reasonable opportunity to respond.\n\nWilliams    asserts       that        the     district      court’s     conclusion      was\n\nsubstantively      flawed        in    that      his    complaint    contained   factual\n\n     1\n       Rule 12(c) states: “After the pleadings are closed--but\nearly enough not to delay trial--a party may move for judgment\non the pleadings.”\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fallegations sufficient to state a claim for Eighth Amendment\n\nviolations on its face.\n\n                                             A.\n\n     We first consider Williams’s argument that by relying on\n\nattachments       to    the   appellees’           answer,       the     district     court\n\nimproperly       converted    appellees’           motion     for      judgment      on   the\n\npleadings to a motion for summary judgment without giving notice\n\nto Williams.       We review a district court’s actions in converting\n\na Rule 12 motion into a motion for summary judgment for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       See Baker v. Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 171\n\nF.3d 939, 943 n.* (4th Cir. 1999).\n\n     Matters       outside       of    the        pleadings       are     generally       not\n\nconsidered in ruling on a Rule 12 motion.                               Am. Chiropractic\n\nAss’n v. Trigon Healthcare, Inc., 367 F.3d 212, 234 (4th Cir.\n\n2004).     Matters--such as exhibits--are outside the pleadings if\n\na complaint’s factual allegations are not expressly linked to\n\nand dependent upon such matters.                  See id.     A court may convert a\n\nRule 12 motion into a summary judgment proceeding in order to\n\nconsider matters outside of the pleadings.                              Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(d); Bosiger v. U.S. Airways, 510 F.3d 442, 450 (4th Cir.\n\n2007).     In doing so, however, the court must assure that the\n\nparties    are    on    notice   of    the       changed    status       of   the    motion.\n\nDavis     v.   Zahradnick,       600    F.2d       458,     460     (4th      Cir.    1979).\n\nNevertheless,      it    is   widely    accepted          that    if    the    plaintiff’s\n\n                                             8\n\fallegations, taken as true, do not state a claim for relief, any\n\nerror caused by such a conversion without notice is harmless.\n\nSee, e.g., Renchenski v. Williams, 622 F.3d 315, 341 (3d Cir.\n\n2010); Colbert v. Potter, 471 F.3d 158, 168 (D.C. Cir. 2006);\n\nUnited States v. Stevens, No. 95-6739, 1995 WL 559524, at *1\n\n(4th Cir. September 21, 1995) (unpublished).\n\n     Here, the district court considered both the DOC Policy and\n\nProcedure Manual and select reports from Williams’s inmate file\n\nregarding    his    mental    health       status.         Although   Williams’s\n\nallegations are arguably dependent on and linked to the DOC’s\n\npolicies and procedures, we are troubled by the district court’s\n\nreliance on reports from Williams’s inmate file handpicked by\n\nthe defendants, because the complaint is not dependent on such\n\nreports.     Nonetheless, in reviewing the district court’s order\n\nto dismiss, we will consider only the allegations set forth in\n\nWilliams’s complaint.         Accordingly, any error by the district\n\ncourt will be rendered harmless.\n\n                                       B.\n\n     We    now   consider    whether   Williams      has    pleaded   sufficient\n\nfacts on which to state a violation of the Eighth Amendment.                  We\n\nconclude that he has not.\n\n     We review a grant of a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings de novo, applying the same standard of review we\n\napply to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, Burbach Broad. Co.\n\n                                       9\n\fof Del. v. Elkins Radio Corp., 278 F.3d 401, 405-06 (4th Cir.\n\n2002).       Specifically, we look to whether the factual allegations\n\nin the complaint “raise a right to relief above the speculative\n\nlevel and . . . state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\n\nface.”       Robinson v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 551 F.3d 218, 222\n\n(4th     Cir.    2009)    (internal      quotation       marks     omitted).          “In\n\nconducting this review, we take the facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff, but we need not accept the legal\n\nconclusions drawn from the facts, and we need not accept as true\n\nunwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or arguments.”\n\nGiarratano      v.    Johnson,     521    F.3d    298,       302   (4th   Cir.   2008)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Although the text of the Eighth Amendment is limited to\n\ncruel    and    unusual    punishments,         the    Amendment      may    also     “be\n\napplied to some deprivations that were not specifically part of\n\nthe sentence but were suffered during imprisonment.”                         Wilson v.\n\nSeiter, 501 U.S. 294, 297 (1991).                In this way, “[t]he Amendment\n\n. . . imposes duties on [prison] officials, who must provide\n\nhumane conditions of confinement; prison officials must ensure\n\nthat    inmates      receive     adequate      food,    clothing,      shelter,       and\n\nmedical care.”       Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994).\n\n       The    Supreme    Court    has    prescribed      a    two-part      inquiry    to\n\ndetermine whether prison officials’ conduct violated their duty\n\nunder    the    Eighth    Amendment      to    provide       humane   conditions       of\n\n                                          10\n\fconfinement. 2        The first part of the inquiry asks whether the\n\nconditions     of     confinement       inflict      harm    that    is,     objectively,\n\nsufficiently serious to deprive a prisoner of minimal civilized\n\nnecessities.          Id. at 834.          The second part of inquiry asks\n\nwhether    prison        officials     subjectively         acted    with     “deliberate\n\nindifference        to     inmate    health    or    safety,”       meaning    that      they\n\nactually knew         of    and     disregarded      the    inhumane       nature   of   the\n\nconfinement.        Id. at 837 (internal quotation marks omitted).                        We\n\nconsider each prong in turn.\n\n                                              1.\n\n     We must first determine whether Williams’s conditions of\n\nconfinement      objectively           deprived      him     of     minimal     civilized\n\nnecessities such as adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical\n\ncare,     or   physical        safety.         See    In     re     Long     Term   Admin.\n\nSegregation      of      Inmates      Designated      as    Five     Percenters       (Five\n\n\n     2\n        Williams’s complaint contains allegations that may be\ninterpreted both as claims of inadequate medical care based upon\nthe lack of effective treatment for his mental illness and\ninhumane conditions of confinement based on his isolation and\nrestrictions.   For the purposes of our analysis, however, this\nis a distinction without a difference. See Wilson, 501 U.S. at\n303 (“[W]e see no significant distinction between claims\nalleging inadequate medical care and those alleging inadequate\n‘conditions of confinement.’      Indeed, the medical care a\nprisoner receives is just as much a ‘condition’ of his\nconfinement as the food he is fed, the clothes he is issued, the\ntemperature he is subjected to in his cell.”). Accordingly, we\nreview the sufficiency of all of his allegations under the same\nrubric.\n\n\n                                              11\n\fPercenters), 174 F.3d 464, 472 (4th Cir. 1999).                               This analysis\n\nis informed by our recognition that “[o]nly extreme deprivations\n\nare adequate to satisfy the objective component of an Eighth\n\nAmendment claim regarding conditions of confinement.”                                    Rish v.\n\nJohnson, 131 F.3d 1092, 1096 (4th Cir. 1997).\n\n       Williams’s first claim of extreme deprivation is that he\n\nwas denied effective treatment for his mental illness.                                    For an\n\nallegation     of    inadequate         medical      care       to       support    an    Eighth\n\nAmendment     claim       there    must   be     “neglect           of    ‘serious’      medical\n\nneeds.”     Williams v. Benjamin, 77 F.3d 756, 761 (4th Cir. 1996)\n\n(quoting Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1992)); see also\n\nHudson, 503 U.S. at 9 (“[S]ociety does not expect that prisoners\n\nwill   have    unqualified         access      to    health         care.”).        Assuming,\n\nwithout     deciding,       that    Williams’s         mental            illness    created     a\n\nserious medical need, we conclude that his allegations regarding\n\nhis medical treatment do not rise to the level of neglect.                                     For\n\ninstance, Williams does not allege that his illness was ignored\n\nor that he was denied treatment, either altogether or even to a\n\nconsiderable extent.               To the contrary, his complaint alleges\n\nthat   he   has     had    “numerous      stays      in    an       inpatient      psychiatric\n\nsetting.”       J.A. 7.           Williams points to no authority for the\n\nproposition        that     the      Eighth         Amendment            entitles        him    to\n\n“effective”       treatment,       or   that     DOC      is    a    guarantor      of    mental\n\nhealth.       Cf. Jackson v. Meachum, 699 F.2d 578, 583 (1st Cir.\n\n                                            12\n\f1983) (noting that to “make the Eighth Amendment a guarantor of\n\na prison inmate’s prior mental health . . . would go measurably\n\nbeyond     what         today    would    generally      be      deemed    ‘cruel       and\n\nunusual’”).             Accordingly,     we    cannot    hold     that    the    lack    of\n\neffective mental health treatment deprives Williams of a basic\n\nhuman need.\n\n       Williams next claims that the conditions of his confinement\n\namount    to       an   extreme     deprivation      because      the    isolation      and\n\nbehavioral restrictions to which he is subject “aggravate” his\n\nmental illness and thus “cause him present and ongoing injury to\n\nhis mental health.”              Appellant’s Br. 11, 13.           The conditions of\n\nwhich Williams complains, however, are no different from those\n\nwe found not actionable in Five Percenters, amid a claim that\n\nthose    conditions        harmed    plaintiffs’        mental    health.        In    that\n\ncase, plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that they were “confined\n\nto their cells for twenty-three hours per day without radio or\n\ntelevision, that they receive[d] only five hours of exercise per\n\nweek,    and    that      they    [could]     not   participate     in    prison      work,\n\nschool, or study programs.”                 174 F.3d at 471.        We observed that\n\nnegative       effects     of    such    restrictions     on     mental    health      “are\n\nunfortunate concomitants of incarceration; they do not, however,\n\ntypically constitute the ‘extreme deprivations . . . required to\n\nmake    out    a    conditions-of-confinement            claim.’    ”      Id.    at    472\n\n(quoting Hudson, 503 U.S. at 8-9).\n\n                                              13\n\f       The    fact     that    the     conditions           to    which     Williams    was\n\nsubjected aggravated his mental illness is an unfortunate but\n\ninevitable result of his incarceration.                      This is particularly so\n\ngiven the twin responsibilities of prison officials to limit the\n\nopportunities        for    Williams       to    harm   both      himself    and   others.\n\nAccordingly, we cannot conclude that such aggravation amounts to\n\nthe denial of a minimal civilized necessity, especially when the\n\nconditions alleged to have caused that aggravation clearly meet\n\nor exceed minimal standards.                Because Williams’s allegations do\n\nnot show an extreme deprivation resulting in the denial of a\n\nminimal necessity of life, his claim must fail.\n\n                                                2.\n\n       Even if Williams alleged facts in his complaint sufficient\n\nto show an extreme deprivation resulting in the denial of a\n\nminimal necessity of life, however, he would still have to show\n\nthat   prison        officials     were     deliberately           indifferent     to   the\n\ndeprivation and the substantial risk of harm resulting from it.\n\nSee Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836.                     This is a subjective standard:\n\nWilliams must show an actual awareness of the danger, not merely\n\nthat officials should have been aware of it.                                See Brown v.\n\nHarris,      240     F.3d   383,     389    (4th      Cir.       2001).      Furthermore,\n\n“general knowledge of facts creating a substantial risk of harm\n\nis not enough.         The prison official must also draw the inference\n\nbetween      those    general      facts        and   the    specific     risk     of   harm\n\n                                                14\n\fconfronting the inmate.”                    Johnson v. Quinones, 145 F.3d 164, 168\n\n(4th Cir. 1998).\n\n       In       an      attempt        to     establish         deliberate           indifference,\n\nWilliams alleges, in conclusory fashion, that “[a]s trained and\n\nexperienced corrections professionals, [appellees] are aware of\n\nthe dangers and risks to [Williams] caused by their policies of\n\nlong       term      confinement        and    the    cruel       and   unusual         conditions\n\nimposed         upon     him.”          J.A.     10.            Appellees’           training   and\n\nexperience, however, can, at most, support an allegation that\n\nthey should have known of the risk to Williams’s mental health\n\nposed      by     the    lack     of    effective      treatment          and    conditions      of\n\nconfinement.              Williams          alleges        no     facts     suggesting          that\n\nappellees         had    actual        knowledge      of    the    risks        to    him.      This\n\nomission is fatal to his claim.                       As we have held, “[t]he prison\n\nofficial ‘must both be aware of facts from which the inference\n\ncould be drawn that a substantial risk of harm exists, and he\n\nmust also draw the inference.’ ”                            Johnson, 145 F.3d at 168\n\n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837). 3\n\n\n       3\n       Williams seeks to rely on Farmer to support his allegation\nof actual awareness. In that case, the Supreme Court considered\nwhether   an   Eighth  Amendment   violation   occurred  when   a\ntranssexual prisoner was allegedly beaten and raped by fellow\ninmates when he was placed in the general prison population.\n511 U.S. at 833-34.     Williams asserts that in Farmer, prison\nofficials were “aware of the heightened risk to plaintiff’s\nsafety posed by the conditions on the unit based on his\ntranssexuality.” Appellant’s Br. 16. Williams goes on to argue\n(Continued)\n                                                 15\n\f       Finally, even if prison officials were aware of the harm\n\nWilliams was suffering, his allegations are insufficient to show\n\nthat officials were indifferent to that harm.                   Where the safety\n\nof the inmate, other inmates, or prison staff are at issue, the\n\nsubjective component of the Eighth Amendment inquiry also takes\n\ninto   consideration       “threat[s]     to    .   .   .   safety    .   .    .    as\n\nreasonably perceived by the responsible officials on the basis\n\nof the facts known to them, and any efforts made to temper the\n\nseverity of a forceful response.”               Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S.\n\n312,   321.        Cf.   Bell   v.   Wolfish,    441    U.S.   520,   547     (1979)\n\n(“Prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging\n\ndeference     in     the   adoption     and     execution      of   policies       and\n\npractices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\n\norder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”).\n\n\n\nthat prison officials here were likewise aware of his mental\nillness, and therefore of the “heightened risk to him posed by\nthe    conditions   of    long-term   segregated   confinement.”\nAppellant’s Br. 16.      This analogy does not aid Williams,\nhowever, because the Supreme Court in Farmer never decided\nwhether the plaintiff in that case satisfied the subjective part\nof the test; it merely opined that the district court had used\nan incorrect standard in evaluating his claim and remanded for\nreconsideration.   511 U.S. at 848-49.   In other words, Farmer\ndoes not stand for the proposition that that a prison official’s\nknowledge of a characteristic that could create a risk of harm\nto an inmate provides that official with actual knowledge of a\nspecific risk of harm to that inmate.     Instead, as stated in\nJohnson, a prisoner must allege that prison officials actually\ndrew the inference between the characteristic and a specific\nrisk of harm.\n\n\n                                        16\n\f       In his complaint, Williams acknowledges a history of self\n\nabuse and behavioral outbursts, and that he has been diagnosed\n\nwith       a     number    of        potentially     violent     conditions--such      as\n\n“psychotic disorder” and “intermittent explosive disorder”--that\n\nput him and others, including inmates and staff, at risk of\n\nharm.          J.A. 7.     Specifically, his complaint alleges that he has\n\n“a psychiatric history of self injury and reports of thoughts\n\nabout          suicide.         He     has    numerous    stays    in    an    inpatient\n\npsychiatric setting due to his extensive history of ingesting or\n\ninserting foreign bodies, and severe self lacerations that have\n\nrequired         emergency       medical      attention.”        Id.      Against    this\n\nbackground,          the    conditions        of    Williams’s    confinement       appear\n\ndesigned to limit his ability and opportunity to inflict harm on\n\nhimself         or   others,      rather      than    intended    to    exacerbate    his\n\nmedical condition. 4                 As such, appellees’ institution of these\n\nconditions           cannot     be     said    to    be   a    result   of    deliberate\n\nindifference on their part.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       Indeed, had prison officials loosened the restrictions on\nWilliams, and Williams then took his own life, those prison\nofficials could face liability for their deliberate indifference\nto Williams’s suicide risk.

For purposes of our review, we assume them to be\n\ntrue.     See McVey v.

Throughout           his\n\nincarceration, Williams has suffered from severe mental illness\n\nand     was    diagnosed     with,    among        other        disorders,         psychotic\n\n                                            3\n\fdisorder,     schizophrenia,        borderline       personality    disorder,    and\n\nintermittent explosive disorder.                Williams’s mental illness has\n\nmanifested itself through, inter alia, behavioral outbursts as\n\nwell as “thoughts of suicide [and the] ingesting or inserting\n\n[of] foreign bodies[] and severe self lacerations.”                         J.A. 7.\n\n“He has [had] numerous stays in an inpatient psychiatric setting\n\ndue to his extensive history of ingesting or inserting foreign\n\nbodies, and severe self lacerations that have required emergency\n\nmedical attention.”        Id.\n\n       As a result of his mental illness and its manifestations,\n\nat    the   time   of    his   complaint        in   2010,   Williams     had   spent\n\napproximately      10     years     of   his    incarceration      in    “segregated\n\nconfinement.”           J.A.   8.        Williams    described     his    segregated\n\nconfinement as follows:\n\n       [A] small cell whose dimensions are approximately\n       twelve feet by six feet.      The floor, walls, and\n       ceiling of the cell are concrete.   There is a narrow\n       window that looks out only on the hallway outside the\n       cell.   There is a slot through which food trays and\n       other materials may be passed, and through which\n       [Williams] must extend his hands to be cuffed before\n       the steel door is opened.\n\nId.    Beyond the spartan nature of his confinement, Williams was\n\nalso subject to several lifestyle restrictions.                         For example,\n\nWilliams was only “allowed to leave his cell for one hour on\n\nfive days of each week”; was “kept indoors constantly” and has\n\nnot had “outdoor recreation [for] several years”; was allowed\n\n\n                                            4\n\fminimal contact with other inmates; could not participate in\n\nreligious, work, rehabilitative, or other activities; and was\n\nnot   allowed     “access     to     a   television,       and    ha[d]    very   limited\n\naccess to reading materials.”                   J.A. 8-9.        In addition to these\n\nrestrictions, Williams was subject to additional punishment at\n\ntimes, including being placed in “restraints in a concrete cell\n\nalone     for    four    hour      periods[,]        caus[ing]      pain    and     mental\n\ndistress.”       J.A. 9.\n\n                                               B.\n\n        Williams brought suit against appellees under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983,     claiming       that       “[i]nstead        of    [receiving]       effective\n\ntreatment for his mental illness” he was “being punished with\n\natypical and significant hardships over and above those imposed\n\nunder    his     sentence.”         J.A.    8.       Williams     alleged    that    these\n\nhardships were a result of policies created and implemented by\n\nappellees and were in violation of his right under the Eighth\n\nAmendment to be provided with adequate medical care and humane\n\nconditions of confinement.                 Specifically, Williams alleged that\n\n“[t]he social isolation, arbitrary punishments, lack of exercise\n\nand   other      conditions     of       the    confinement       imposed    on   him   by\n\npolicies created and maintained by [appellees] have caused [him]\n\nserious and unnecessary pain and suffering.”                      J.A. 10.\n\n      As Williams described it, his mental illness caused him to\n\nact   out,      which   in   turn    led       to   additional     restrictions.        He\n\n                                               5\n\falleges     the    existence    of     a    pernicious        circle.        As     these\n\nrestrictions       mounted,     they       aggravated       his    mental        illness,\n\ncausing him to misbehave further.                 Williams was “told he will be\n\nallowed     additional       privileges         when   he    is    able     to    remain\n\ninfraction free for long periods of time, yet the effect of [the\n\nrestrictions] effectively prevents him from remaining infraction\n\nfree.”       Id.        Williams     has        alleged     that   this     cycle      was\n\nexacerbated       by   the   fact    that       “[c]orrectional     staff        are   not\n\ntrained in the identification and management of the mentally\n\nill.      They assume that Plaintiff is willfully disobedient or\n\ndisruptive, when in fact his behavior is at times beyond his\n\ncontrol.”    Id.       As to the appellees, Williams further alleged:\n\n       As trained and experienced corrections professionals,\n       [appellees] are aware of the dangers and risks to\n       [Williams] caused by their policies of long term\n       confinement and the cruel and unusual conditions\n       imposed upon him.      Regardless of this knowledge,\n       [appellees] have acted with deliberate indifference to\n       his right to be free from unnecessary suffering and\n       mental and physical harm.\n\nId.\n\n       Williams sought a declaration that his treatment violated\n\nthe Eighth Amendment and an injunction barring DOC officials and\n\nemployees from treating Williams in a similar fashion in the\n\nfuture.\n\n       Appellees filed an answer with various exhibits attached,\n\nand moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule\n\n\n                                            6\n\fof Civil Procedure 12(c). 1             The district court granted appellees’\n\nmotion,    concluding       that       “although         [Williams’s]    conditions      of\n\nconfinement       are    unpleasant,          they     do   not    deprive   Williams    of\n\nbasic human needs.”              J.A. 182.             In its opinion, the district\n\ncourt    relied    on     some    of    the      exhibits     to    appellees’   answer,\n\nincluding portions of the DOC Policy and Procedure Manual and\n\nselect reports from Williams’s inmate file regarding his mental\n\nhealth status.          In doing so, however, the district court did not\n\nindicate that it was converting appellees’ motion for judgment\n\non the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                              II.\n\n        On appeal, Williams argues that the district erred both\n\nprocedurally and substantively in granting appellees’ motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings.                    Williams argues that the district\n\ncourt     erred     procedurally            in       considering     exhibits    to     the\n\nappellees’ answer, thereby constructively converting appellees’\n\nRule 12(c) motion into a Rule 56 summary judgment motion without\n\ngiving Williams notice or a reasonable opportunity to respond.\n\nWilliams    asserts       that        the     district      court’s     conclusion      was\n\nsubstantively      flawed        in    that      his    complaint    contained   factual\n\n     1\n       Rule 12(c) states: “After the pleadings are closed--but\nearly enough not to delay trial--a party may move for judgment\non the pleadings.”\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fallegations sufficient to state a claim for Eighth Amendment\n\nviolations on its face.\n\n                                             A.\n\n     We first consider Williams’s argument that by relying on\n\nattachments       to    the   appellees’           answer,       the     district     court\n\nimproperly       converted    appellees’           motion     for      judgment      on   the\n\npleadings to a motion for summary judgment without giving notice\n\nto Williams.

The conditions of\n\nwhich Williams complains, however, are no different from those\n\nwe found not actionable in Five Percenters, amid a claim that\n\nthose    conditions        harmed    plaintiffs’        mental    health.        In    that\n\ncase, plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that they were “confined\n\nto their cells for twenty-three hours per day without radio or\n\ntelevision, that they receive[d] only five hours of exercise per\n\nweek,    and    that      they    [could]     not   participate     in    prison      work,\n\nschool, or study programs.”                 174 F.3d at 471.        We observed that\n\nnegative       effects     of    such    restrictions     on     mental    health      “are\n\nunfortunate concomitants of incarceration; they do not, however,\n\ntypically constitute the ‘extreme deprivations . . . required to\n\nmake    out    a    conditions-of-confinement            claim.’    ”      Id.    at    472\n\n(quoting Hudson, 503 U.S. at 8-9).\n\n                                              13\n\f       The    fact     that    the     conditions           to    which     Williams    was\n\nsubjected aggravated his mental illness is an unfortunate but\n\ninevitable result of his incarceration.                      This is particularly so\n\ngiven the twin responsibilities of prison officials to limit the\n\nopportunities        for    Williams       to    harm   both      himself    and   others.\n\nAccordingly, we cannot conclude that such aggravation amounts to\n\nthe denial of a minimal civilized necessity, especially when the\n\nconditions alleged to have caused that aggravation clearly meet\n\nor exceed minimal standards.                Because Williams’s allegations do\n\nnot show an extreme deprivation resulting in the denial of a\n\nminimal necessity of life, his claim must fail.\n\n                                                2.\n\n       Even if Williams alleged facts in his complaint sufficient\n\nto show an extreme deprivation resulting in the denial of a\n\nminimal necessity of life, however, he would still have to show\n\nthat   prison        officials     were     deliberately           indifferent     to   the\n\ndeprivation and the substantial risk of harm resulting from it.\n\nSee Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836.                     This is a subjective standard:\n\nWilliams must show an actual awareness of the danger, not merely\n\nthat officials should have been aware of it.                                See Brown v.\n\nHarris,      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772092\"><a href=\"/opinion/772092/james-brown-administrator-of-the-estate-of-robert-brown-v-g-w-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,     389    (4th      Cir.       2001).      Furthermore,\n\n“general knowledge of facts creating a substantial risk of harm\n\nis not enough.

Appellees’           training   and\n\nexperience, however, can, at most, support an allegation that\n\nthey should have known of the risk to Williams’s mental health\n\nposed      by     the    lack     of    effective      treatment          and    conditions      of\n\nconfinement.              Williams          alleges        no     facts     suggesting          that\n\nappellees         had    actual        knowledge      of    the    risks        to    him.      This\n\nomission is fatal to his claim.                       As we have held, “[t]he prison\n\nofficial ‘must both be aware of facts from which the inference\n\ncould be drawn that a substantial risk of harm exists, and he\n\nmust also draw the inference.’ ”                            Johnson, 145 F.3d at 168\n\n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837). 3\n\n\n       3\n       Williams seeks to rely on Farmer to support his allegation\nof actual awareness. In that case, the Supreme Court considered\nwhether   an   Eighth  Amendment   violation   occurred  when   a\ntranssexual prisoner was allegedly beaten and raped by fellow\ninmates when he was placed in the general prison population.\n511 U.S. at 833-34.     Williams asserts that in Farmer, prison\nofficials were “aware of the heightened risk to plaintiff’s\nsafety posed by the conditions on the unit based on his\ntranssexuality.” Appellant’s Br. 16. Williams goes on to argue\n(Continued)\n                                                 15\n\f       Finally, even if prison officials were aware of the harm\n\nWilliams was suffering, his allegations are insufficient to show\n\nthat officials were indifferent to that harm.                   Where the safety\n\nof the inmate, other inmates, or prison staff are at issue, the\n\nsubjective component of the Eighth Amendment inquiry also takes\n\ninto   consideration       “threat[s]     to    .   .   .   safety    .   .    .    as\n\nreasonably perceived by the responsible officials on the basis\n\nof the facts known to them, and any efforts made to temper the\n\nseverity of a forceful response.”               Whitley v. Albers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">312</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   321.        Cf.   Bell   v.   Wolfish,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>   <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   547     (1979)\n\n(“Prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging\n\ndeference     in     the   adoption     and     execution      of   policies       and\n\npractices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\n\norder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”).\n\n\n\nthat prison officials here were likewise aware of his mental\nillness, and therefore of the “heightened risk to him posed by\nthe    conditions   of    long-term   segregated   confinement.”\nAppellant’s Br. 16.      This analogy does not aid Williams,\nhowever, because the Supreme Court in Farmer never decided\nwhether the plaintiff in that case satisfied the subjective part\nof the test; it merely opined that the district court had used\nan incorrect standard in evaluating his claim and remanded for\nreconsideration.   511 U.S. at 848-49.   In other words, Farmer\ndoes not stand for the proposition that that a prison official’s\nknowledge of a characteristic that could create a risk of harm\nto an inmate provides that official with actual knowledge of a\nspecific risk of harm to that inmate.     Instead, as stated in\nJohnson, a prisoner must allege that prison officials actually\ndrew the inference between the characteristic and a specific\nrisk of harm.\n\n\n                                        16\n\f       In his complaint, Williams acknowledges a history of self\n\nabuse and behavioral outbursts, and that he has been diagnosed\n\nwith       a     number    of        potentially     violent     conditions--such      as\n\n“psychotic disorder” and “intermittent explosive disorder”--that\n\nput him and others, including inmates and staff, at risk of\n\nharm.          J.A. 7.     Specifically, his complaint alleges that he has\n\n“a psychiatric history of self injury and reports of thoughts\n\nabout          suicide.         He     has    numerous    stays    in    an    inpatient\n\npsychiatric setting due to his extensive history of ingesting or\n\ninserting foreign bodies, and severe self lacerations that have\n\nrequired         emergency       medical      attention.”        Id.      Against    this\n\nbackground,          the    conditions        of    Williams’s    confinement       appear\n\ndesigned to limit his ability and opportunity to inflict harm on\n\nhimself         or   others,      rather      than    intended    to    exacerbate    his\n\nmedical condition. 4                 As such, appellees’ institution of these\n\nconditions           cannot     be     said    to    be   a    result   of    deliberate\n\nindifference on their part.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       Indeed, had prison officials loosened the restrictions on\nWilliams, and Williams then took his own life, those prison\nofficials could face liability for their deliberate indifference\nto Williams’s suicide risk.
