The State subsequently filed\nnotice of intent to seek the death penalty. Defendant tendered a plea\nof guilty but mentally ill; however, the State disputed the existence\nof mental illness. The parties subsequently agreed to an evidentiary\nhearing in which the trial court simultaneously received evidence\nconcerning the factual basis for the plea and conducted a bench trial\non the issue of guilt/innocence. The trial court ultimately rejected\n\fdefendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill and his bench trial defense\nof insanity. The court found defendant guilty of first degree murder.\nDefendant waived a jury for the eligibility stage of capital sentencing,\nand the circuit court subsequently found defendant eligible for the\ndeath penalty based upon prior murder convictions. See 720 ILCS\n5/9–1(b)(3) (West 2004). Defendant elected jury consideration for the\naggravation/mitigation phase of sentencing. After considering\nevidence in aggravation and mitigation, the jury concluded that death\nwas the appropriate sentence. See 720 ILCS 5/9–1(g) (West 2004).\nThe circuit court thereafter sentenced defendant to death. Because\ndefendant was sentenced to death, his appeal was brought directly to\nthis court. Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, §4(b); 134 Ill. 2d R. 603.\n     On appeal, defendant contends that (1) the trial court erred in\nordering defendant restrained during trial, and instructing the jury\nthat “security measures” had been implemented; (2) the trial court’s\nrepeated on-the-record criticisms of recent appellate court opinions\ndeprived defendant of due process and fundamental fairness; (3) the\ntrial court denied defendant due process and fundamental fairness\nwhen the court disparaged the motives and conduct of attorneys from\nthe Office of the State Appellate Defender; (4) the trial court abused\nits discretion in rejecting defendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill;\n(5) the trial court’s verdict of guilty, instead of guilty but mentally ill,\nwas against the manifest weight of the evidence; (6) the trial court’s\nstatement to the sentencing jury, that the court had rejected\ndefendant’s insanity defense at trial, and the prosecutor’s reference\nthereto in closing argument, “improperly demeaned the defendant’s\nmitigating evidence of mental illness, and punished defendant for\nexercising his constitutional right to present a defense”; (7) the trial\ncourt erred in denying defendant’s request to submit experts’ reports\nto the jury; (8) the trial court erred in improperly assisting the\nprosecutor in cross-examining a witness and thus establishing a\nfoundation for a prosecution exhibit; (9) the prosecutor’s closing\nargument denied defendant due process; (10) the sentencing jury\nshould have been specifically instructed that a background of extreme\nemotional or physical abuse is a mitigating factor; and (11) the\nIllinois death penalty statute violates principles announced in\nApprendi in that it does not require application of the reasonable\ndoubt standard at the second stage of capital sentencing proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fWe set forth, hereafter, a summary of the evidence pertinent to a\ndiscussion of the issues raised by defendant.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n    On July 14, 1996, police found the nude body of an unidentified\nwoman floating in the Vermilion River in Livingston County. The\nwoman’s wrists had been handcuffed, her ankles were bound with\nduct tape, and her mouth was covered with duct tape. An autopsy\nrevealed that the victim had died of a single gunshot wound to the\nhead and seven stab wounds to the head and chest. The body was\nlater identified as that of Cassandra Corum. Corum had been reported\nmissing from Hammond, Indiana.\n    Corum’s murder was subsequently linked to the murders of two\nyoung women in Cook County. The bodies of Laura Uylaki and Lynn\nHuber had been found in Wolf Lake, a body of water in Cook\nCounty, near the Indiana border. Each of those victims had also been\nshot in the head and stabbed multiple times. Ballistics tests indicated\nthat all three victims were killed by bullets fired from the same gun.\n    On April 1, 1997, a police officer in Hammond, Indiana,\nresponded to a call involving defendant and a prostitute. The\nprostitute told the officer that defendant had wanted to take her to\nWolf Lake, handcuff and duct tape her, and have sex with her. In\nNovember of 1996, the same officer had arrested defendant for\nunlawful possession of a firearm, and at that time had found rolls of\nduct tape in defendant’s truck. The Hammond police officer\nforwarded the information he had obtained to Chicago detectives,\nwho subsequently obtained the gun seized from defendant as a result\nof his November 1996 arrest. Testing revealed that defendant’s gun\nhad fired the bullets that killed Cassandra Corum, Laura Uylaki, and\nLynn Huber.\n    On April 22, 1997, Chicago police officers approached defendant,\nwho voluntarily agreed to talk with them. At the police station,\ndetectives showed defendant photographs of Corum, Uylaki, and\nHuber, but defendant claimed he did not recognize them. During the\nquestioning, defendant indicated he had bought his handgun\napproximately four or five years earlier from a gunshop in Calumet\nCity, and it had been under his exclusive control until it was\nconfiscated in Hammond, Indiana. When officers told defendant the\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthree women had been killed by bullets fired from his gun, defendant\npaused for a minute, took off his security guard badge, started taking\noff his shoelaces, and said, “Well, I guess I’m not going to work\ntoday.” Defendant then provided the police with detailed confessions\nto all three Illinois murders. Without prompting from the police,\ndefendant also mentioned “some matters” that California authorities\n“might be interested in.” Defendant subsequently confessed to the\nmurders of Robbin Brandley, Julie McGhee, Mary Ann Wells,\nTammy Erwin, and Denise Maney, as well as the kidnapping, rape,\nand attempted murder of J.A., all of which were committed in\nCalifornia between 1986 and 1995.\n     The details of those offenses were provided in testimony and\nevidence presented at the aggravation/mitigation phase of sentencing,\nand will be recounted in our discussion of that portion of defendant’s\ntrial.\n     On March 10, 1998, a Livingston County grand jury returned a\nfour-count indictment charging defendant with first degree murder\nfor the killing of Cassandra Corum. In March of 2001, the State filed\nnotice of its intent to seek the death penalty, alleging three possible\neligibility factors: that the defendant had been convicted of\nmurdering two or more individuals (720 ILCS 5/9–1(b)(3) (West\n2000)), that he had killed Cassandra Corum during the course of an\naggravated kidnapping (720 ILCS 5/9–1(b)(6) (West 2000)), and that\nthe murder was committed in a cold, calculated, premeditated manner\npursuant to a preconceived plan (720 ILCS 5/9–1(b)(11) (West\n2000)).\n     Defendant was convicted of the Cook County murders, and was\nsentenced to death on September 3, 2002. In that case, a jury rejected\nclaims that defendant was legally insane or mentally ill as defined in\nsection 6–2(d) of the Criminal Code of 1961. See 720 ILCS 5/6–2(d)\n(West 2002). On January 10, 2003, then-governor George Ryan\ncommuted defendant’s death sentence to one of natural life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole.\n     On November 3, 2003, defendant’s appointed counsel in this\ncase, Steven Skelton and James Elmore, requested that the trial judge\naccept the appearance of attorney Stephen Richards as additional\ncounsel for defendant. Richards was a deputy defender with one of\nthe State Appellate Defender’s Death Penalty Trial Assistance offices\n(hereafter DPTA). The trial judge allowed Richards to enter his\n\n                                 -4-\n\fappearance with the understanding that Skelton and Elmore would be\n“lead counsel” and that the court would look to them for management\nof the case.\n     Richards subsequently tendered a written entry of appearance\nduring a hearing conducted on December 1, 2003. On that document,\nJohn Hanlon and Allan Sincox, staff attorneys of DPTA, were also\nlisted as entering their appearance. The trial judge did not\nimmediately notice the unauthorized addition of Hanlon and Sincox,\na matter that came to the court’s attention when the judge observed\nwhat he perceived as disruptive behavior in the courtroom:\n            “THE COURT: Who is the gentleman behind Mr.\n        Richards, because I am getting tired of the expressions on his\n        face and his gyrations. *** And now he is quite red-faced and\n        he seems very angry.\n            Sir, who are you?\n            MR. SINCOX: My name is Allan Sincox. My appearance\n        is now on file. Mr. Richards filed an appearance with my\n        name listed on it today. I have been assisting with this case.\n            THE COURT: You are not an attorney in this case, sir.\n        You are not now an attorney in this case.\n            Oh, I see the appearance has–well, I gave permission, Mr.\n        Richards, for you to assist Mr. Elmore and Mr. Skelton at this\n        relatively late date. I have not given permission for John\n        Hanlon, Allan Sincox to do so. I have not heard from Mr.\n        Elmore and Mr. Skelton that they want their assistance. So\n        the way the record stands now, and I do thank you for calling\n        that to my attention[,] Mr. Richards has been requested for\n        assistance in this case by Mr. Skelton and Mr. Elmore. I have\n        not heard from them as to John Hanlon or Allan Sincox. I am\n        concerned about you, you are Mr. Sincox?\n            MR. SINCOX: Yes, I am, Judge.\n            THE COURT: I am concerned about your professional\n        demeanor here in court today. On four or five occasions you\n        have gripped your head and shaken your head. And it is\n        quite–it is at least distracting to me ***.\n            MR. SINCOX: Well, that is my fault. And I do apologize.\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f             THE COURT: Your apology is accepted. I didn’t know\n        you were an attorney. Quite frankly, I am shocked.”\nAttorney Sincox then noted that he had been involved in the trial of\ndefendant’s cases in Cook County, and he explained: “[T]here are\nthings I find myself wanting to tell the lawyers.” The court\nresponded, “I understand the emotional factor, but you are an\nattorney, and you should know better.” The court then clarified the\nstatus of defendant’s representation, noting that “Mr. Richards is in\nthe case; Mr. Hanlon and Mr. Sincox are not.” The record indicates\nthat the names of Hanlon and Sincox were, at some point, stricken\nfrom the entry of appearance.\n     At a subsequent hearing on December 23, 2003, Richards was\nallowed to argue various pretrial motions for the defense, without\ncomment or objection from the trial judge. The trial court reserved\nruling on two of those motions, and denied the remainder.\n     Later, on February 6, 2004, during a pretrial hearing attended\nonly by the prosecutors and attorneys Skelton and Elmore, Skelton\nbroached the possibility that he might ask the court to allow attorney\nSincox to “enter his appearance for the limited purpose of deposing\nDr. [Park] Dietz in California.” The trial judge asked counsel, “Is this\nall going to get accomplished in time not to impact on the trial date?”\nCounsel for defendant nodded affirmatively. The court then\nexpressed “concern” about Sincox’s involvement in the case, noting\nthat he had acted “very unlawyer-like the only time that he was here”\nand that he had conducted himself “in a very unprofessional manner.”\nAt that point, the prosecutor questioned why Sincox had to be\ninvolved and why Skelton and Elmore could not conduct the\ndeposition.\n     Without further comment on the prosecutor’s statement, the trial\njudge commended attorneys Skelton and Elmore for the job they had\ndone to that point, and then stated his belief that attorneys Sincox and\nRichards had “an agenda far greater than” the defendant’s case. He\nindicated he wanted to ensure that Elmore and Skelton remained in\ncontrol of the case and exercised their “independent judgment.”\nContinuing, the trial court stated:\n             “I can see a deposition out there going into several areas,\n        well, now they are objecting, and now I am supposed to rule\n        on objections taking place out in California. I don’t trust Mr.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f         Sincox. *** His conduct in this courtroom was most\n         unprofessional. It is clear to me that he has an agenda far\n         greater than Mr. Urdiales and he is motivated by that. And I\n         am concerned that his conduct will be governed by that. ***\n         And if he goes far afield out there, we have got a mess on our\n         hands in terms of, well, now the deposition wasn’t completed.\n         Now we are going to certify some questions and get those\n         back to this court. And we are moving great amounts of cases\n         away from this calendar of mine in Livingston County. I got\n         a heavy calendar and we are making lots of room and going\n         through all kinds of exercises here to get this case tried in\n         April. And I want to get it tried in April.”\n     The trial judge observed: “It is premature to rule on this motion.\nIt’s not yet filed. If you do file it, you need to make plans. I have no\nproblem hearing this motion by conference call ***.” The court then\nmoved on, questioning the prosecutors as to whether the reports of\ncertain experts would be timely filed and were “on track.”\n     The record indicates that a motion was later filed requesting that\nSincox be allowed to enter a limited appearance to take the\ndeposition of Dr. Dietz. On March 4, 2004, in one of many pretrial\nconferences, the court addressed that motion:\n             “THE COURT: There was a motion here with respect to\n         Mr. Sincox. I am finding that motion rendered moot because\n         Mr. Elmore is going to go [to California] and Mr. Sincox is\n         not now a member of the defense team. I indicated some\n         reluctance to increase the defense team at this point and bring\n         in somebody new. And that issue simply goes away if Mr.\n         Elmore is going to go to California if necessary.”\n             MR. ELMORE: Yes, I think both Mr. Skelton and myself\n         anticipate making a trip out there.”\nDefense counsel did not object to the court’s statement that the\nmotion was moot and did not take any action to obtain a ruling on the\nmotion.\n     Also prior to trial, the court addressed the matter of courtroom,\nsecurity. On April 19, 2004, just prior to jury selection, the court\nnoted for the record:\n         “[T]he defendant is seated there at table where his hands are\n         free. He is in street clothes. There is an eyebolt in the floor.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f        And there he has shackles on his legs. And that shackle is\n        attached to the eyebolt in the floor. The jury, I believe it is\n        correct, will not be able to see that shackling. They will be\n        unaware of it unless Mr. Urdiales makes some noise or some\n        motion that would call their attention to it. And I want to at\n        least see if there is any objection on the record.”\nDefense counsel stated that the judge’s remarks were “factual and\ncorrect,” that the defendant wanted the record to reflect that he was\nsecured in that fashion, and the defense had “no objection to it now.”\n    The trial court then discussed two recent appellate court cases\npertaining to courtroom security and restraint of defendants, noting\nthat he “respectfully disagree[d] with both [of] those decisions,” but\nhe had to “take them into account.” The trial judge also\nacknowledged this court’s decision in People v. Boose, 66 Ill. 2d 261\n(1977). The judge suggested that appellate court justices might not\nappreciate how “trial circumstances have changed,” in part because\nsome of them have “never been trial judges” and have “never\npracticed criminal law.” The trial judge offered his observation that\n“[t]imes have simply changed,” and that he had seen “a great deal of\nviolence occurring in [the] courtroom,” noting the presence of two\nprisons within the county.\n    The court made clear that defendant had behaved appropriately\nup to that point. However, the judge observed that defendant had\nbeen recently convicted of two murders and, though his death\nsentence had been commuted, he was still serving two life sentences.\nThe court stated that was one factor in its decision to restrain\ndefendant. The court also noted that defendant was in good health\nand had no difficultly getting around; thus, suggesting that defendant\ncould pose a physical threat. Moreover, the court observed that the\nLivingston County courthouse was built in 1875 and there were “all\nkind of security problems” with the building and the courtroom. The\njudge pointed out that the courtroom was small and seating was close.\nHe stated that two guards would be seated in the row behind the\ndefendant. In that respect, the court observed:\n        “The jurors, I think, will understand that. And importantly for\n        a reviewing court, I have learned over the years that the jurors\n        aren’t stupid. And they will be told the defendant is in\n        custody and that certain security measures have been taken,\n        such as the guards being here. They would expect that. And\n\n                                  -8-\n\f         I believe they can handle that and still give both sides a fair\n         trial.”\nWith that, the trial court asked: “Is there anything else on that issue\nthat either the State or the defense wishes to bring up?” For the\ndefense, attorney Skelton responded, “No, sir.”\n     The court then recessed prior to the commencement of jury voir\ndire. During that recess, out of the presence of the trial judge and\npotential jurors, a disturbance occurred in the courtroom.\nSubsequently, without potential jurors present, the trial judge swore\nin one of the correctional officers guarding defendant in order to\nascertain what had happened. The officer, Craig Valleroy, testified\nthat defendant had turned to talk to a lady seated behind him. The\nofficers initially thought the woman was a lawyer, but when she\nindicated otherwise, they told defendant he could not speak with her.\nDefendant then became angry. Stating, “I don’t give a damn,” he\nslapped a cup of water on the table in front of him, sending it flying,\nand he “threw *** stuff around.” He was told to settle down, and was\nthen physically subdued and handcuffed.\n     After ascertaining what had happened, the trial judge asked\ndefendant, “Will you promise to behave yourself if I do not shackle\nyou.” Defendant did not respond to the court directly. Rather,\ndefendant had attorney Skelton note for the record that defendant had\nnot been shackled during proceedings in Cook County and there had\nbeen no outbursts or problems. Counsel stated: “And he is concerned\nabout his perception of the respect he is being shown here by both the\ncourt and security personnel in the courtroom.” Counsel\nacknowledged that he had attended defendant’s trial in Cook County\nand that the “logistics of that courtroom and the parameters of that\ncourtroom are somewhat different.”\n     In response to the concerns expressed by defendant, the trial\njudge observed that “the world changed” for defendant with his\nmurder convictions in Cook County, suggesting, had defendant been\nfound not guilty there, the court “would have been doing something\ndifferent here.” The court also pointed out, “you are on trial here for\nyour life.” As a result of the incident, the court ordered defendant’s\nleft hand shackled under the table as well. Though the court allowed\ndefendant’s right hand to remain free, the court ordered that\ndefendant be given no pencils or pens.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f    Two days later, in chambers, the trial judge, with defense counsel\nand counsel for the prosecution present, revisited the issue of\ncourtroom security and addressed the circumstances of defendant’s\nprior courtroom outburst. The court noted that jurors were not present\nwhen defendant “ went ballistic,” “went berserk, throwing water all\nover.” The court observed that “two very large guards were necessary\nto restrain him notwithstanding that he was already shackled by his\nfeet to an eye bolt on the floor.” The judge then asked attorney\nElmore whether he had overstated the incident with the use of the\nterms “ballistic” and “berserk.”\n    Elmore responded that the judge had not overstated the severity\nof the incident, and added that “there were actually three guards”\ninvolved. Elmore indicated that the guards had to take defendant to\nthe floor to subdue him and that defendant had knocked over the table\nwhere he was seated.\n    At that juncture, the trial judge criticized various justices of the\nappellate court for positions they had taken on the issue of shackling,\nstating that one of them had, in an appellate court opinion, “really\nroughed me up because I shackled some inmates.” The judge\nexpressed concern “that people with that frame of mind will speculate\nthat I contributed to the event on Monday because I had Mr. Urdiales\nshackled.” The court observed:\n         “First of all, the response of defendant to go berserk was an\n         overreaction on his part. If he didn’t like that, he should have\n         communicated to counsel. He should have said something in\n         court. We did not have a word of protest coming from him\n         prior to that. He simply went off.”\nThe court characterized defendant as a “high risk individual.” The\ntrial judge observed that there had been a change in defendant’s\ndemeanor after he was convicted of the murders in Cook County and\nsentenced to death. The court stated: “Mr. Urdiales I have concluded\nfears that judgment day is coming closer.” The judge noted “a\ndramatic change” at the prior pretrial hearing, when defendant\n“learned that this trial was actually going to go forward finally.” The\ncourt continued, “I saw without a doubt an emotion in his eyes that\nI had not seen before. *** I saw furtive movements on the part of Mr.\nUrdiales; and I see quite frankly, honestly a desperate man.” The trial\njudge then embarked upon yet another diatribe against what he saw\nas the appellate court’s unwarranted intrusion into the security\n\n                                  -10-\n\fconcerns of the circuit court, expressing his belief that the appellate\ncourt seemed “bent on causing trial judges trouble.” The judge\nindicated he would have a transcript of the proceedings sent to certain\nnamed justices of the appellate court.\n    Following that harangue, the judge again indicated that he did not\nbelieve the jury could see the shackling of defendant because of\nskirting around the table where defendant was seated. He asked\ndefense counsel: “[D]o you want me to free up Mr. Urdiales more\nthan I am contemplating doing?” In response, attorney Skelton asked\nonly that defendant be given a writing implement short enough that\nit would pose no danger to counsel or anyone else. The court then\nstated: “DOC has had in the past inch pencils. *** It’s a very small\npencil. We’ll explore that and come up with a writing material that\ncouldn’t do you harm.” Still addressing the security issue, Skelton\nthen stated:\n            “Half facetiously, the only thing I want to make sure of is\n        that Mr. Urdiales is seated on a very heavy chair. For the\n        record, I had an unfortunate experience about 14, 16 years\n        ago where an inmate from Pontiac Correctional Center\n        decided that a better place for a chair was on my head than on\n        the floor. I know what the court’s talking about. I’ve been\n        there.”\n    Elmore thereafter sought to clarify what had prompted the\ndefendant’s courtroom outburst, noting that defendant “became upset\nnot because he was shackled but because he could not communicate\nwith his parents and Kendra Moses.” Elmore explained that\ndefendant had originally told a Livingston County correctional officer\nthat Moses was an attorney, and Elmore subsequently told them\notherwise, noting that she was a “mitigator,” not an attorney.\nAccording to Elmore, defendant then turned and “glared at [Elmore]\nfor a second,” prompting Elmore to caution defendant, “Andrew,\nwe’re not going to do that now. She’s not an attorney.” Elmore said\na correctional officer then politely informed defendant that he could\nnot talk to Moses at that point in time. Elmore explained, “That’s\nwhat precipitated him becoming upset. It wasn’t even, in my mind,\n*** the fact he was shackled that’s what caused him to go off. Just to\nsupport your position further, it wasn’t the shackling I don’t think\nthat really upset him. It was the fact he couldn’t communicate with\nMoses, and he went off.”\n\n                                 -11-\n\f    A prosecutor interjected, “He was lucky he was shackled at that\npoint or he would have had much more free rein.” The same\nprosecutor added: “Mr. Elmore should tell you, but it’s up to him,\nthat he knows something with regard to a previous meeting in prison\nin a room with Mr. Urdiales that he later learned endangered his own\nself; but he’d have to tell you that. I bring it up. I guess he doesn’t\nwant to. It solidifies [the court’s] intuition, and I know about it from\nseveral months ago.” Although the judge indicated he would “ask the\ndetails,” the matter was apparently dropped as the court and parties\nmoved on to matters bearing upon jury selection.\n    Jury voir dire began on April 19, 2004. At the outset, the trial\njudge advised potential jurors:\n        “You may or may not notice that Mr. Urdiales is in custody.\n        And we have taken certain security measures because of that\n        simple fact. You would expect us to do that for anyone who’s\n        in custody. The fact that Mr. Urdiales is presently in custody\n        should not impact in any way whatsoever on the\n        determination of whether Mr. Urdiales is found guilty or not\n        guilty ***.”\nA total of eight jurors were selected for trial on the first day of\nselection. When jury selection resumed on the morning of April 22,\ndefense counsel advised the court in chambers that defendant,\n“without any urging,” had raised the possibility of entering an open\nplea of guilty to the murder charges against him. Attorney Skelton\nnoted: “If *** Mr. Urdiales determines that he wants to plead guilty\nwithout–and we are talking a straight guilty plea–not trying to\nstructure in a way of guilty but mentally ill plea, that would–and it is\nan understatement to say–substantially modify the manner in which\nwe would approach potential jurors, the remaining four, plus\nalternates in this case.”\n    The trial judge expressed concern over developments and stated\nthe obvious: that defendant should take such an action only after “full\ndeliberation.” The judge encouraged counsel to consult with\ndefendant further.\n    After another brief period of consultation with defendant,\nattorney Skelton reported that defendant was steadfast in his desire\nto plead guilty, however, it was likely that defendant would enter a\nplea of guilty but mentally ill. The defense contemplated “a waiver\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fof jury as to the first phase of the proceeding, plea of guilty, with the\ncourt determining the existence or lack of mental illness.” The\ndefendant would retain his right to a jury trial for the sentencing\nphase of the death penalty proceeding. A prosecutor advised the court\nand defense counsel that the State would dispute whether defendant\nwas in fact “mentally ill,” as that term is defined in the statute.\nAttorney Skelton, again speaking to procedure, reiterated that the\ncourt would decide whether defendant was mentally ill: “There\nwould be a bench trial as to the existence or lack of mental illness.\nThere would not be a trial before the Court as to the elements of the\noffense, that is that he killed Cassandra Corum.” Counsel advised the\ncourt that a jury would be needed for the “second and third” stages of\ndeath penalty proceedings, the eligibility and aggravation/mitigation\nphases.\n    After further discussion and consultation, it was decided that the\ncourt would admonish defendant the next morning and conduct a\nhearing on defendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill (GBMI);\nhowever, the court would reserve ruling until jury selection was\ncomplete. Then the court would take additional evidence on mental\nillness, and either accept the plea of guilty but mentally ill or proceed\nwith the jury trial.\n    On April 23, 2004, the defendant tendered his plea of guilty but\nmentally ill. The trial court admonished defendant thoroughly\nconcerning the nature of the charge, the possible penalties, the three\nseparate stages of a capital trial, and the variety of verdicts possible\nin the event the defendant retained his right to trial. The trial court\nexplained that, by pleading guilty but mentally ill, the defendant\nwould be giving up the defense of insanity, and a finding of guilty but\nmentally ill would not insulate him from a possible death sentence.\nThe defendant indicated he understood the admonitions. The judge\ndetermined that defendant had not been subject to threats or coercion,\nand that his plea of guilty but mentally ill was voluntary.\n    The trial judge indicated he would not decide whether to accept\nthe plea of guilty but mentally ill until there had been a full\nevidentiary hearing. The court explained the possible outcomes and\nramifications of that proceeding, and defendant again indicated he\nunderstood. Defendant then signed and tendered a plea of guilty but\nmentally ill, which specified that he retained his right to jury trial on\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fall issues if the plea was rejected, and his right to a jury for\nsentencing if the plea was accepted.\n    The State then presented an extensive factual basis for the murder\nof Cassandra Corum. Defendant did not dispute the factual basis\npresented, and the court concluded that there was a sufficient factual\nbasis “with respect to the murder elements themselves.” The court\nagain indicated that it would not accept the plea of guilty but\nmentally ill until there had been an evidentiary hearing on the issue\nof mental illness. Thereafter, jury selection resumed, with four\nadditional jurors, and six alternates, chosen over the next several\ndays.\n    After the completion of jury selection, defense counsel informed\nthe court that, in the event the court rejected the plea of guilty but\nmentally ill, the defendant was considering waiving a jury for the\nguilt/innocence phase and requesting a bench trial to preserve his\ninsanity defense. Noting that a jury had already been chosen and was\nwaiting to hear the case, the trial judge expressed some reluctance to\nallow the jury waiver, as well as frustration with both the defense and\nthe appellate court.\n    Nonetheless, on May 4, 2004, the parties and the trial court\nagreed to conduct two hearings simultaneously. Pursuant to the\nagreed mode of procedure, the trial court would consider whether\nthere was sufficient evidence of mental illness to support defendant’s\nplea of guilty but mentally ill, i.e., whether defendant suffered from\n“a substantial disorder of thought, mood, or behavior” which afflicted\nhim at the time of the offense and “impaired his judgment.” See 720\nILCS 5/6–2(d) (West 2004). In the event the court ultimately rejected\nthe GBMI plea, the judge would also consider whether defendant had\nestablished the defense of insanity. The defense stipulated that the\nprosecutor’s previously recited factual basis was sufficient to\nestablish the basic elements of the murder charge. Defendant was\nadmonished regarding the proposed procedure, and consented to it,\nwaiving his right to a jury trial on the guilt/innocence phase.\n    For purposes of the dual proceedings, the trial court admitted and\nconsidered several exhibits documenting psychiatric evaluations of\nthe defendant, and also heard live testimony from expert witnesses.\nThe defense called three witnesses: Drs. Terry Killian, James\nMerikangas, and Daniel Cuneo. The State called two witnesses: Drs.\nJanet Willer and Park Dietz. Written reports of Drs. Killian, Cuneo,\n\n                                 -14-\n\fMerikangas, and Dietz were among the exhibits considered by the\ncourt, as were reports received from two nontestifying defense\nexperts, Drs. Charles Opsahl and Dorothy Otnow Lewis.\n    Dr. Killian, a psychiatrist, believed defendant was legally sane,\nbut mentally ill, at the time of Corum’s murder. Killian diagnosed\ndefendant as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\nbipolar mood disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, obsessive\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), dissociative disorder, Tourette’s,\npersonality disorder, and mild neurological impairment. Killian felt\nthe most significant of these was dissociation, which is something\nlike multiple personalities. Killian believed, in defendant’s case, an\n“angry part” of him “takes some degree of control,” though it “does\nnot appear to be complete control as you would see in a full blown,\nmultiple personality disorder.” Dr. Killian believed defendant was not\nmalingering because he did not volunteer symptoms as he could\nhave. Killian acknowledged that defendant had read a book by Dr.\nLewis, his expert for his unsuccessful insanity defense in Cook\nCounty, and could have feigned symptoms from that book.\n    At one point in his testimony, Killian specifically stated that\ndefendant, in his opinion, “was afflicted by a substantial disorder of\nthought, mood, or behavior which impaired his judgment but not to\nthe extent that he was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his\nbehavior.” Later, Killian was asked by defense counsel whether the\nterm “mentally ill,” as used in section 6–2(d) of the Criminal Code,\nwas consistent with his understanding of that term, as used in his\npractice. At that time, he acknowledged:\n            “Mentally ill is a pretty vague term in a clinical sense.\n        Mentally ill is generally used in psychiatry to refer to a wide\n        range of psychiatric disorders that impair people to mild\n        extents, substantial extents, or impair them to the point where\n        they are unable to function; so it’s a very broad term without\n        a very specific definition in clinical use.”\nKillian explained he could only “describe [defendant’s] symptoms [as\nobserved or described to him],” put those together in “an organized\ndiagnostic formulation,” and explain the “nature of the psychiatric\ndisorders” and the reasons, and extent to which, defendant has them.\nHe concluded, “[I]t is the fact finder’s position to decide whether that\nmeets the burden of the law.”\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f     Dr. Daniel Cuneo, a psychologist, also testified that defendant\n“had a substantial disorder of thought, mood, and behavior which\nimpacted upon his judgment.” Cuneo examined defendant in 2003\nand 2004, and concluded that he suffered from PTSD, bipolar\ndisorder, Tourette’s, OCD, personality disorder, mild neurologic\nimpairment, and a history of sexually transmitted diseases. Unlike\nKillian, who believed that dissociation was the most significant or\nsubstantial of defendant’s mental maladies, Cuneo thought that PTSD\nwas the most significant of defendant’s disorders. Cuneo did believe\nthat the defendant occasionally suffered from episodes of\ndissociation, which occurred during periods of extreme stress. In that\nregard, he noted defendant’s use of the pronoun “we” and the names\nEric, Andy, and Andrew to refer to aspects of his personality. Cuneo\ndid not believe that defendant was malingering.\n     In his report, Cuneo concluded that defendant’s mental illness\n“did not substantially impair his ability to appreciate the criminality\nof his conduct when he is alleged to have killed Cassie Corum. He\ncould have controlled his behavior then and he knew that killing was\nwrong.” However, Cuneo testified to his belief that defendant’s\n“judgment was impaired throughout” due to escalating anger.\n     On cross-examination, Cuneo acknowledged that defendant’s\nactions during the killings exhibited planning and preparation, and\nthat defendant “was clever enough to have killed individuals and hid\nit for a period of time.” Cuneo also conceded that it is possible for a\nperson to be a “clever, mean, sexual, sadistic individual who likes to\nkill women,” yet not suffer from a mental disorder.\n     The prosecutor asked Cuneo about defendant’s “explosive anger,”\nwhich Cuneo believed had resulted in impaired judgment and\nviolence. In posing that question, the prosecutor first noted that\ndefendant had initially become angry with Cassandra Corum at Wolf\nLake, “his favorite murder dumping ground of women.” The\nprosecutor next observed that defendant had restrained her there and\nthen “drove a hundred miles from where he exploded in *** anger\n*** all the way to Pontiac, so he had a whole hour and a half of\ndriving with her.” In light of those circumstances, the prosecutor\nasked whether defendant’s anger would have subsided by the time he\ngot to Pontiac.\n     In response, Cuneo stated that defendant’s debilitating anger\nwould not have subsided until “the murder was done.” He continued,\n\n                                 -16-\n\fclarifying his position: “I don’t believe, at any point, this individual\nwas impaired to the extent that he was unable to think *** what I am\nsaying is that it’s an impairment of judgment ***.”\n    Dr. Merikangas, a psychiatrist, opined that defendant had an\norganic brain disease, which rendered him insane at the time of the\ncrime. Merikangas disagreed with Killian and Cuneo insofar as they\ndiagnosed defendant with PTSD and dissociative personality\ndisorder. Merikangas noted that scans of defendant’s brain in 2002\nshowed atrophy, which might have resulted from improper treatment\nof syphilis. Tests also showed frontal lobe damage, lack of reflexive\nresponse, and decreased blood flow and metabolism in the right\ntemporal lobe of defendant’s brain. Dr. Merikangas believed episodes\nof loss of control and loss of reason were brought on by stress, such\nas sexual situations when defendant was belittled or there was a fight.\nThough Merikangas did not identify a source of stress, he reported\nthat defendant had “a violent attack of rage at the Cook County jail”\nduring Merikangas’ interview with defendant.\n    Dr. Opsahl’s report set forth a diagnosis of “significant\nneuropsychological impairment” and “paranoid psychosis in the\npresence of a cyclic mood disorder that includes elements of both\nhypomania and depression.” The report did not address defendant’s\nbehavior at the time of the murder.\n    Dr. Lewis’ report concluded that defendant was “flamboyantly\npsychotic at the time of the alleged offenses and was operating in\nresponse to delusions and command hallucinations.” Lewis’ report\ncontained statements by defendant that he heard voices that gave him\ninstructions from the CIA. She also reported references to “Andrew\nand Eric” as separate personalities.\n    Dr. Willer, a psychologist who worked for the Veterans\nAdministration, saw defendant approximately 105 times between\n1991 and 1996. She believed defendant suffered from mild\ndepression and avoidant personalty disorder.\n    Dr. Dietz, a psychiatrist, testified, rendering his opinion that, at\nthe time of Corum’s murder, defendant had the capacity “to\nappreciate the criminality of his conduct and to conform his conduct\nto the requirements of the law,” and he did not fit within Illinois’\nstatutory definition of guilty but mentally ill. Dietz concluded that\ndefendant did not have a substantial disorder of thought, mood, or\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fbehavior, as required by the statute. Dietz diagnosed defendant as\nsuffering from Tourette’s syndrome, a personality disorder with\nschizotypal traits, and sexual sadism. He believed it was defendant’s\nanger, rather than a substantial mental disorder, that impaired\ndefendant’s judgment when he murdered Cassandra Corum. Dietz did\nnot believe that defendant had PTSD, but even if he did, Dietz\ncategorized PTSD as an anxiety disorder, not a mental illness; thus,\nit would not meet the definition of mental illness under Illinois law.\nHe also rejected the possibility of organic brain damage because\nneurological tests, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in\n2004, were within the normal range. In Dietz’s opinion, defendant’s\nuse of the passive voice and plural pronouns when describing his\nactions while murdering his victims was nothing more than a\nlinguistic device “to distance himself from responsibility for the\noffense.”\n    Dietz believed that defendant’s judgment was in fact impaired\nwhen he committed the murder, but not by a mental illness. In Dietz’s\nopinion, “nearly everyone” who commits murder “has impaired\njudgment at the time, including this defendant.” Dietz testified that\nanger was the “one clearly provable element that impaired\n[defendant’s] judgment.” However, Dietz identified two other “prime\ncandidates” as “sexual desire” and “a kind of predatory desire for\nconquest.” The latter observations were consistent with Dietz’s\ndiagnosis that defendant was a sexual sadist, which he defined as one\nwho exhibits “an enduring pattern of sexual excitement or desire\ninvolving the infliction of pain or the humiliation of others.”\n    Dietz based his diagnosis of sexual sadism primarily upon the\naccount given by defendant’s sole surviving victim, J.A. As Dietz\nnoted, her description of defendant’s behavior at the time he raped\nand tortured her is the only description of defendant’s criminal\nactions that was not given by defendant. Dietz summarized J.A.’s\naccount of her ordeal as follows:\n        “[In] that incident he called her a bitch, held a knife to her\n        throat, pulled her head into the dashboard, bound her hands\n        behind her back, pulled her by the hair to force fellatio, cut\n        off her shorts, underwear and bra, gagged her with her\n        underwear and bra, called her a bitch, a whore, a slut, as he\n        raped her vaginally, scripted her language, namely telling her\n        exactly what to say. He directed her to say that she loved him.\n\n                                 -18-\n\f        Hit her, strangled her to the point of unconsciousness, and bit\n        her neck drawing blood. That is a classic textbook description\n        of the abducting and rape of a woman by a sexual sadist.\n        Because he is demeaning her, controlling her, causing her\n        pain while experiencing sexual excitement. Every feature of\n        that is exactly what we expect to find in sexually sadistic\n        types. And the significance of [J.A.’s] account is that she is\n        the only living victim of rape and abduction that can tell us\n        what defendant actually does with a victim. For every other\n        case, that is the eight homicides, we only know what the\n        corpse can tell us and what the defendant is willing to say.”\nDietz acknowledged that a single incident is not sufficient to\ndiagnose sexual sadism, so he supported his diagnosis with another\nreported incident–one that led to defendant’s arrest–in which a\nprostitute described a 1997 encounter with defendant. Patricia Kelly\nreported that defendant had asked her to accompany him to the Wolf\nLake area and allow him to handcuff her, duct tape her, tie her up,\nand have sex with her in the back of his truck. Dietz believed that\nrequest was also suggestive of sexual sadism. Dietz answered\naffirmatively when the prosecutor asked whether there were “some\nsimilarities concerning binding and gagging and binding and abusing\nthe other victims even though they are not here to tell us.” Finally,\nDietz reported that defendant had acknowledged that there is a part\nof him “that enjoys torture, that would like to inflict as much damage\nas possible, that enjoys bondage and sadomasochistic activity, that\nwants to control.”\n    At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the hearing, the\ncircuit court indicated it would entertain arguments of counsel.\nAttorney Skelton then asked the court: “What standard is the Court\napplying concerning the existence of the factual basis for the\nexistence of mental illness at the time of the offense?” An extended\ndiscussion ensued between the parties and the court concerning the\nappropriate standards and evidentiary burdens the court would apply,\nwith the defense arguing that the court had no authority to weigh the\nevidence adduced on the issue of mental illness. At the conclusion of\nthat discussion, the court stated its belief that cases pertaining to\nuncontested guilty pleas would not apply to defendant’s plea of guilty\nbut mentally ill, since the State, in this case, was contesting whether\ndefendant was in fact mentally ill as defined in section 6–2(d) of the\n\n                                 -19-\n\fCriminal Code. The court nonetheless commented that “the burden\nthe defense has at this proceeding *** dealing with whether the court\nshould accept or reject the plea of guilty but mentally ill is not a\npreponderance of the evidence. That would be the case at bench trial.\nIt is less than that.” However, the court still determined that it should\n“weigh” the evidence presented at the hearing, noting that defendant\nwas not entitled to have the court “simply disregard the evidence\npresented by the State.” Following arguments of the parties, the court\nindicated it would recess over the weekend to consider the evidence\nand arguments.\n     On the morning of May 10, 2004, the court announced its rulings\nin chambers in order to protect the defendant from media coverage\nand to ensure that the sentencing jury would not be tainted when it\nlater heard evidence of mental illness. First, having weighed the\nevidence presented by the defense and the prosecution, the trial judge\nstated he was not satisfied that a factual basis existed to support\ndefendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill, noting that “the evidence\nfails to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the\ndefendant was guilty but mentally ill at the time of the incident\ncomplained of.” Moreover, the court ruled that defendant had not\nestablished, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was insane\nat the time of Corum’s murder. Finally, the court found the State had\nproven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of first\ndegree murder as charged in the indictment.\n     In support of his ruling, the trial judge noted that the principal\ndefense witnesses disagreed in their primary diagnoses. Cuneo\nbelieved that defendant suffered, primarily, from PTSD; Killian’s\nprincipal diagnosis was dissociation; and Merikangas determined that\ndefendant suffered from organic brain disease, disagreeing with\nKillian’s and Cuneo’s diagnoses of PTSD and dissociative\npersonality disorder. Killian and Cuneo believed that defendant was\nlegally sane, but mentally ill, as defined in section 6–2(d);\nMerikangas testified that defendant was insane, as defined in section\n6–2(a).\n     The court also found that defendant’s experts had failed to\nexplain how defendant was able to function in society during his\nseven years in the Marine Corps, or employed as a security guard,\nwhile suffering from the diagnosed illnesses. The court found that\ndefendant’s actions during the offense were inconsistent with those\n\n                                  -20-\n\fof a person overcome by anger. To the contrary, they demonstrated\nplanning and organization. The court rejected the assessments of\nMerikangas and Killian that defendant’s crimes were not\ncharacterized by planning and organization, noting that defendant\nbrought a gun, a knife, duct tape, and handcuffs. The court\nconcluded, “the defendant went prepared and in fact successfully\ncarried out this murder as well as seven others.” With respect to the\ndefendant’s psychiatric evaluations, the court observed that defendant\nhad “learned some things” about evaluations in the course of his\nunsuccessful trial in Cook County. As Killian acknowledged in his\ntestimony, defendant had read Lewis’ book, titled “Guilty But\nMentally Ill.”\n    The trial judge found the testimony of Dr. Dietz “substantially\nmore persuasive and more convincing than that of the defense\nexperts.” As noted, Dietz believed that defendant was not legally\ninsane and he did not meet the statutory criterion for a finding of\nguilty but mentally ill. The court accepted Dietz’s assessment that\ndefendant is a sexual sadist and is “angry at the world and his\nunsuccessful circumstances in life.” The court stated: “[T]o rule in\nfavor of the defense, I would have to totally set aside the testimony\nof Dr. Park Dietz, which *** I find to be the most convincing and\npersuasive of the witnesses,” and “even more importantly, to find in\nfavor of the defense, I would have to disregard the facts of this case.”\n    After announcing his ruling, and before convening in open court,\nthe trial judge revisited the issue of courtroom security, noting that\nthe jury would not see the shackling of defendant because of skirting\naround defendant’s table, reiterating his earlier findings, and\nenunciating two additional factors. The court noted, since its original\nruling regarding the physical restraint of defendant, the court had\nbeen apprised of the full extent and scope of defendant’s homicidal\nactivities in California, and had heard psychiatric testimony\npertaining to defendant’s explosive personality. With those additional\ncomments, the court inquired of defense counsel:\n             “THE COURT: So that is the record on shackling. I guess\n         I should give the defense an opportunity to suggest that I do\n         something differently. I would ask Mr. Skelton and Mr.\n         Elmore, are you asking that I do something differently on\n         shackling than I have decided to do?\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f             MR. SKELTON: Given the totality of the circumstances\n         and the discretion given the Court which I believe is an\n         accurate assessment of the physical layout of the courtroom\n         and the shackling devices and means by which our client is\n         secured in the courtroom, I don’t think it is an issue, Judge.\n             THE COURT: All right. Mr. Elmore.\n             MR. ELMORE: No, Judge. I think what you have done is\n         appropriate under the circumstances.”\n     The court then advanced the proceeding to the eligibility phase of\nsentencing. Defendant waived a jury for the purpose of determining\nwhether he was eligible for the death penalty. Without objection, the\nState introduced defendant’s birth certificate, showing him to be over\n18 years of age, and certified copies of defendant’s two murder\nconvictions in Cook County. The trial court subsequently found that\ndefendant was over the age of 18 when he murdered Cassandra\nCorum and he had been previously convicted of murdering two\nwomen in Cook County, thereby establishing his eligibility for a\ndeath sentence under section 9–1(b)(3) of the Criminal Code (720\nILCS 5/9–1(b)(3) (West 2004)).\n     At the beginning of the third phase of this capital proceeding, the\ntrial court advised the jurors of developments in the first two\nphases–to which the court had referred during jury\nselection–explaining why jurors had not participated in earlier stages\nof the proceeding, and bringing the jurors current on findings made\nduring the initial phases of the trial. The court read the jurors the\nstatutory definition of insanity, and advised jurors that the court,\npursuant to defendant’s jury waivers, had determined (1) that the\nState had proven defendant guilty of Corum’s murder beyond a\nreasonable doubt, (2) that defendant had not proven by a\npreponderance of the evidence that he was legally insane at the time\nof the offense, and (3) that defendant was eligible for the death\npenalty because he was over 18 years of age at the time of the offense\nand had been previously convicted of murdering two or more\npersons. The court noted that those findings were binding upon the\njury, and informed the jury that its function would be to determine\nwhether death was the appropriate sentence. With that, the parties\ngave their opening statements.\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f    Early in defense counsel’s statement to the jury, he acknowledged\nthat the trial judge had rejected defendant’s “plea of insanity,” but he\nadvised the jurors that they could “still consider the background of\nMr. Urdiales *** to see whether or not, not that he is insane, but did\nhe suffer from any mental illness or mental disease or mental defects.\nDid it reduce his ability to think and act? Did it reduce his ability to\nperform like a normal, healthy person?” Counsel told the jurors,\n“Those are facts that you must also consider.”\n    Later, when describing the harsh conditions of incarceration,\nwhich he likened to life “in a cage,” counsel again stated, “The\nevidence will show that while Andrew Urdiales is not insane, *** he\nsuffers from mental illness or mental disease.” Still later, counsel\nstated:\n        “Mr. Urdiales, in fact, does suffer from defects of the brain.\n        And so the question then becomes do we as a society treat\n        someone who is mentally ill as opposed to someone who is\n        mentally healthy the same. And we suggest not. We suggest\n        that the most appropriate way is to punish by life in prison\n        without the possibility of parole.”\nCounsel concluded his opening statement with yet another reference\nto defendant’s mental illness. With the conclusion of opening\nstatements, the State presented evidence in aggravation.\n    In aggravation, the State presented evidence of the eight murders\ncommitted by defendant, as well as J.A.’s testimony describing how\ndefendant kidnapped, raped, and attempted to murder her. In the\ninterests of brevity, we will substantially summarize that evidence,\nwhich is derived from police investigations of the crime scenes and\nfrom interviews with defendant. We note that defendant’s description\nof events did not always agree with the physical evidence discovered\nat the crime scenes, as was the case with the murder of Cassandra\nCorum; however, to simplify the descriptions of the murders, we will\ngenerally recount defendant’s version of events.\n    Defendant’s first murder victim was Robbin Brandley, a\nCalifornia college student he killed in January of 1986. At that time,\ndefendant was in the Marines and stationed at Camp Pendleton in\nCalifornia. Defendant told police he was upset about some\nfriendships at the base, so he decided to rob someone. Defendant took\na “big old hunting knife,” approximately 11 inches long, and drove\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fto a college just north of Camp Pendleton. When he arrived, he took\nup a position in a poorly lit area and waited for someone to walk by.\nWhen defendant saw Brandley, he came up behind her, put his hand\nover her mouth, and told her he wanted her purse. She immediately\ncomplied; however, defendant just put the purse on the hood of her\ncar and began stabbing her in the back. After she fell to the ground,\ndefendant stabbed her several more times in the chest. Once, when\ndefendant stabbed her in the ribs, the knife got stuck, and he had to\nstep on her body in order to remove it. Defendant left Brandley in the\nparking lot to die, having stabbed her a total of 41 times in the back,\nhands, neck, and chest. Defendant told police that his victim “could\nhave been anybody,” and that Brandley “was just a random female.”\n    After the murder, defendant had blood on his jeans, jacket, and\nhands. In order to conceal the blood, and get back on the base,\ndefendant rubbed grease from his car’s engine over his clothes to\nhide the blood. When he returned to the base, defendant told the\nmilitary police that his car had broken down and he had to fix it. The\npolice believed defendant’s story, which made defendant think they\nwere “dumb shits.”\n    Defendant indicated he had the same knife with him when he\nlater had sex with a prostitute in Hollywood. Defendant said, “[S]he\nwas lucky.”\n    In July of 1988, defendant committed his second murder, killing\nJulie McGhee in Cathedral City, California. Defendant picked up\nMcGhee on a road frequented by prostitutes and drove her to a\nremote construction area, where they had sex. Afterwards, defendant\ngot his gun and ordered McGhee out of the car. When she got out, he\nshot her in the head. Defendant noted he “really didn’t feel anything”\nafter killing McGhee. He said it was “just so quiet and peaceful” that\nhe got in his car and drove to a bar where he “had some beers and\nwatched the girls dance.”\n    In September of 1988, defendant killed his third victim, Mary\nAnn Wells. Defendant picked up Wells, who was working as a\nprostitute, and drove her to an industrial area in San Diego, where\nthey had sex. After he finished, defendant shot Wells, recovered the\n$40 he had paid her, dumped her body in an alley, and drove away.\n    Defendant murdered Tammy Erwin in Palm Springs in April of\n1989. Defendant had had sex with Erwin on at least one occasion\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fprior to April 1989. On the night of the murder, defendant picked up\nErwin and took her to a vacant lot, where she performed oral sex on\nhim. Defendant did not remember arguing with Erwin, but he did\nrecall shooting her while he was outside of his truck. After defendant\nshot Erwin, he got into his truck to leave, but noticed that Erwin was\nstill standing up, clutching her head. Without getting out of his truck,\ndefendant shot Erwin a second time, after which she fell to the\nground. Defendant shot her a third time, before driving off.\n     Defendant was discharged from the Marines in 1991, and moved\nback to Chicago to live with his parents. In September of 1992,\ndefendant returned to California for a short visit. During that visit, he\nkidnapped, raped, and attempted to murder J.A.\n      In his statement to police, defendant indicated he first saw J.A.\nat a bus stop and offered her a ride. En route to J.A.’s house-sitting\njob, defendant obtained a telephone number from J.A., which he\nsubsequently determined was a “bum” number. The next morning,\ndefendant waited for J.A. to get off work and offered her to take her\nout for breakfast. J.A. agreed, and got in the car.\n     Defendant later related he was “just feeling upset about the\nnumber or something,” and “something was just kind of building up,\nyou know, tension.” After driving a short distance, defendant stopped\nthe car, reached over and grabbed J.A. by the hair, and produced a\ngun. Defendant observed that J.A. became “pretty much submissive\nfrom that part forward.” Defendant ordered J.A. to turn around, and\nhe tied her hands behind her back. Defendant later told a police\nofficer:\n         “I think *** before we started moving after I tied her hands\n         up, I reached over and I kissed her. I just put my lips on her\n         mouth and then I just started, you know, I was trying to make\n         out with her.”\nWhen defendant started driving again, J.A. told defendant she would\ndo anything he wanted, so defendant unzipped his pants, pulled J.A.’s\nhead down, and said “suck my dick” or “suck my cock.” J.A. then\nperformed oral sex on defendant until he tired of it and “picked her\nback up.” In an interview with police, defendant remarked: “She kept\nasking me where we were going and she’ll do anything I want. Shit\nlike that, you know.”\n\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\f     Defendant drove out into the desert, stopping at one point to cut\nJ.A.’s panties and bra off. Defendant then rolled up J.A.’s panties and\nstuffed them in her mouth. Defendant eventually “tried to rape” J.A..\nDefendant said she “tried to help” him, but “nothing happened”\nbecause he could not achieve an erection. After a while, defendant\nbecame angry and the “tension” began to build. Defendant said he\nbegan to choke J.A., “and she kept kicking and *** her saliva was\ncoming out of her mouth and *** her face was turning blue and then\nred and it was just a battle *** for a while.” Eventually, defendant’s\nhand started to get tired and stiff, so he got off J.A. and sat down.\n     Thereafter, defendant got his gun and pulled J.A. out of the car.\nHe forced her to her knees and again made her perform oral sex on\nhim. Defendant eventually tired of that. Frustrated, he grabbed J.A.,\nwalked her to the back of the car, forced her into the trunk, and drove\noff. At some point during the drive, the lid of the trunk popped open\nand defendant stopped to slam it shut. Before defendant could get\nunderway again, the trunk popped open a second time, J.A. jumped\nout, and she ran away screaming. Defendant later told detectives his\nfirst thought was to shoot her, but he decided against it because there\nwere several cars nearby. Defendant got into his car and drove away.\nHe told the police: “So that was the last time I saw her. I don’t know\nif somebody else picked her up and finished where I started.”\n     J.A., defendant’s sole surviving victim, testified at the\ndefendant’s sentencing hearing. Because J.A.’s testimony provides\nunique insight into defendant’s activities with one of his victims, and\nthe perspective of that victim, we discuss J.A.’s testimony at length.\n     J.A. said she accepted a ride with defendant on the evening of\nSeptember 27, 1992, because she would otherwise have been late for\nwork. Defendant repeatedly asked her for her phone number, so she\neventually gave him a fake number. He then dropped her off at work.\n     The next morning, as J.A. left work, defendant drove up behind\nher and asked her if she wanted to get some breakfast. J.A. recalled\nthat defendant “looked friendly again, just kind of smiling like. I\nwasn’t scared of him.” So, J.A. got into defendant’s car.\n     Defendant soon confronted J.A. about the fake phone number.\nWhen she denied giving him the wrong number, defendant became\nangry. He pulled the car to the side of the road and produced a knife\nand twine. J.A. said, before she “even [had] time to think to jump out\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fof the car,” defendant had the knife to her throat. He pushed her head\ninto the dashboard, calling her a “whore, a bitch, and kinds of crazy\nthings.” He then grabbed her arms behind her back and tied them\ntogether with the twine. Defendant hit J.A. and displayed a gun. J.A.\ntestified she felt “totally helpless.” She recalled, “I was in his control\ntotally; and I even told him, I let him know that I was.” As defendant\nstarted to drive again, he grabbed J.A.’s head and forced her to\nperform oral sex on him.\n    Defendant drove into the desert and stopped the car. J.A. testified\nthat she feared defendant would become even more aggressive if she\nattempted to resist him, so she said, “[I]f you are going to rape me,\nrape me. But please don’t kill me ***.” Defendant did not respond.\nHe proceeded to pull off her shorts and shoes, hitting her in the head\nwith one of her shoes. Defendant then cut off J.A.’s panties with his\nknife and shoved them into her mouth, causing her to vomit and gag.\nAfter that, defendant cut off J.A.’s bra and tied it tightly around her\nmouth.\n    J.A. testified that defendant then raped her, an ordeal that she\ndescribed in graphic detail:\n         “And then he spread my legs open, and then he had sex with\n         me. And then he was hitting on me and just staring at me; and\n         then he was calling me a bitch, a whore, a slut, and I was just\n         crying. *** Then he told me to tell him that I loved him. ***\n         I thought it was kind of stupid because I had underwear\n         shoved down my throat and a bra tied around my mouth; and\n         I was thinking, how *** am I going to say anything ***? I’m\n         gagged. So I just looked into his eyes; and he was saying, say\n         it, bitch, say it. And I just looked into his eyes; and I tried to\n         say like, hello, I can’t say anything. I’ve got stuff in my\n         mouth. And when I tried to talk, I would just gag. *** I think\n         he finally realized that I couldn’t talk with the underwear\n         down my throat so he took it off. And he said, say it, bitch.”\nWhen J.A. said it, it–not surprisingly–sounded insincere. She\nobserved, “It sounded like I was saying it so I wouldn’t die.”\nDefendant said, “You are lying,” and struck J.A. again. He repeatedly\nurged her: “[S]ay it. Say it. Tell me you love me like you mean it.”\n    When J.A. was unable to do so in a satisfactory manner,\ndefendant started strangling her with his hands. J.A. testified:\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\f          “He just grabbed me by the throat and started strangling me\n          until my eyes started rolling back in my head; and then he\n          was yelling at me, calling me a bitch, a slut, a whore. And\n          this whole time I was just so confused, thinking, oh my God,\n          I’m going to die. *** I thought about everybody, and I was\n          wishing some way they could know what my final thoughts\n          were before I died because there was no way, there was no\n          way nobody was going to know anything; and that was the\n          scariest part was that something like this could happen when\n          people are just driving around and going about their day; and\n          I’m in the desert about to be murdered.”\nJ.A. either lost consciousness momentarily or went into shock. She\ntestified she could not feel anything for a while. During that period,\nwhich she described as “really peaceful,” she thought she had died,\nand she felt “happy.” However, that momentary respite passed, and\nJ.A. soon realized that defendant was still choking her, “whipping\n[her] back and forth trying to get [her] back to it.” She related, “And\nthen all of a sudden I just came back to it, and I could feel everything\nagain.”\n     J.A. testified that defendant then began fondling her breasts and\n“sucking” on her neck. Simultaneously, she felt something cold\nrunning down her neck. When defendant stopped, he put his face in\nfront of hers. It was then that she noticed defendant had blood on his\nteeth, and J.A. started to panic again. She recounted: “I knew he tried\nto bite me; but I couldn’t feel it because I was in such bad shock\nsome of the things I didn’t even feel. But then he opened the door.”\n     Defendant exited the car with his gun, and pulled J.A. out of the\ncar by her hair. With his pants down, defendant ordered J.A. to “suck\nit, bitch.” J.A. initially refused. She recalled: “I just wanted to die so\nI said no. And I was hoping that he would just shoot me because I\ncouldn’t take it anymore, and I wanted to go back to that state I was\nin a little while ago.” Defendant again ordered J.A. to “suck it,” and\nhe hit her in the head for emphasis. J.A. resolved to “suck it” and\n“bite it off.” However, immediately after she began, defendant\n“nailed [her] in the head again.” She recalled, “[H]e got really upset\nbecause it wasn’t erect to suck it. It was never erect the whole time,\nand I think that makes him really mad.”\n     Defendant then left J.A. for a moment, removing a bag, with\n“knife blades sticking of it,” from the trunk of the car, and placing it\n\n                                  -28-\n\fin the backseat. J.A. seized the opportunity and tried to escape. She\ntestified: “I started running through the field as fast as I could; and I\ncould see nothing. I could see no roads. I could see nothing; and I\nknew I was doomed; but if I’m going to die, I want to at least ***\nhave someone say that I tried to run.” Defendant eventually caught\nJ.A. by the hair, “ripped it back,” and she fell to the ground.\nDefendant began to drag the partially naked J.A. through cacti and\nback to the car.\n    When he got J.A. back to the car, defendant decided to put her in\nthe trunk. J.A. stated, “I just wanted him to kill me; and he decided\nnot to kill me right then.” Defendant tried to force J.A. into the trunk,\nand she resisted. She recalled: “I thought if I go into this trunk *** I\nam going to be dead. But he kept prolonging it and prolonging it; and\nit was driving me mentally insane.”\n    Defendant was eventually able to force J.A. into the trunk. J.A.,\nwho was tied with twine and clad only in a sweatshirt, thought “about\nbeing chopped up.” She thought she would be taken somewhere and\nwould be “hacked up in pieces.” She tried to kill herself by holding\nher breath and by bashing her head against the inside of the trunk.\nShe recalled, “I didn’t want him to kill me. I wanted to kill myself.”\n    When J.A. was unsuccessful in that attempt, she suffered through\nperiods of panic, and eventually experienced a loss of energy, “like\n*** having a seizure.” J.A. said she then started to pray. After\npraying, she got “really, really calm.” J.A. testified: “I just got all of\nmy energy together; and then I just stretched my arms hardly; and all\nof the twine just busted right off my hands.”\n    Having freed herself, J.A. again succumbed to panic and despair.\nShe testified:\n         “And I kept saying, now what, God? *** I’m in a frickin’\n         trunk. How am I going to get out of this? And so I just lost\n         hope again; and I got the twine; and I wound it up; and I put\n         it around my neck; and I squeezed it really tight; and I was\n         trying to choke myself. *** I couldn’t strangle myself. And\n         I couldn’t think of any other way to kill myself.”\n    J.A. briefly entertained the idea of fighting defendant when he\nopened the trunk, but she quickly decided against it, concluding,\n“He’ll pull me out. We’ll struggle. One of us will die. Probably me\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fsince I have no weapons.” So, J.A. resolved to try and escape from\nthe trunk.\n    J.A. eventually found the latch of the trunk. She recalled she\n“pushed something, pulled something, turned something, and it went\nclick.” She lifted the trunk a little bit and there was “light\neverywhere.” J.A.’s state of mind was such that she initially\ncontemplated whether to “jump out and get run over and die,” which\nshe “really didn’t mind” at that point, or to actually try to save\nherself. She decided on the latter course, and raised the trunk lid in\nsuch a way as to draw defendant’s attention.\n    Defendant quickly pulled over, and shortly thereafter appeared at\nthe rear of the car with his gun. Defendant slammed the trunk lid\nclosed and yelled, “Don’t open that trunk, bitch. I’ll shoot out the\nback seat.” He then got back in the car, but was unable to drive away\nbecause the car had become stuck in the soft sand.\n    Defendant kept trying to move the car while he intermittently\nthreatened to kill J.A. if she tried to open the trunk again. J.A.\neventually unlatched the trunk a second time, jumped out, and ran. As\nshe did so, she looked back and saw defendant in pursuit with a\nmachete. As she ran, J.A. tried to get motorists to stop, but they\nwould just drive by. Finally, she saw a truck coming. J.A. recounted:\n“So I just ran in front of it with my eyes closed because I thought he\nwas real near to me so I wanted to be run over before I was hit with\nthat [machete].” The occupants of the truck, two Marines, grabbed\nJ.A. and put her in their truck. When she told them what had\nhappened, they initially began chasing defendant, until she told them\nhe was heavily armed, at which point they desisted. The two Marines\ntook J.A. to a nearby gas station; the police were called; and J.A. was\nthereafter taken to hospital.\n    Under cross-examination, J.A. acknowledged that she still has the\nexperience “following [her] around” and that she is now “different\nmentally.”\n    Three years after he kidnapped, raped, and attempted to kill J.A.,\ndefendant murdered Denise Maney in Palm Springs. During a\nvacation to California in March of 1995, defendant picked up Maney\nin the same area where he had earlier picked up McGhee and Erwin.\nDefendant drove Maney to the desert, and stopped the car on a\ndeserted side road, where he ordered Maney to strip and perform oral\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fsex on him. Defendant said he got “tired” of that after a while, so he\ngrabbed Maney by the hair, walked her over to the front of the car,\nand told her to lie face down on the ground. Defendant got on top of\nher and tied her hands behind her back. He again directed her to\nperform fellatio. However, defendant said, he “wasn’t really feeling\nsatisfied,” so he turned Maney over on her knees and “shoved” one\nof his fingers into Maney’s anus. Maney screamed. Defendant\nrecalled, “And then after awhile I drove in two fingers. I just kept\ngoing–shoving my fingers in her ass. *** And that went on for a\nwhile. I just kept doing that to her.” Defendant said, when he got tired\nof that, he picked her up and walked her toward the desert. When she\nturned around, defendant put his gun in her mouth. “And then it went\noff.” The gunshot blew off the back of Maney’s head.\n    Defendant stated: “Then she fell and she was still like gurgling\n*** making a lot of noises. But I had some blood on me a little bit\nand the gun[,] so I just walked away.” Defendant got in his car, and\nstarted to drive away, but he eventually stopped. Defendant stated: “I\ndidn’t feel nothing *** I didn’t really think. I just kind of like\nwiped–cleaned my hand off a little bit and I stopped, turned around\nand I went back to her.” Defendant then described his mood as\n“angry” and “very upset.” He said, this time, he took his knife out.\n    In relating what he did next, defendant slipped back and forth\nbetween use of the singular pronoun “I” and the plural pronoun “we.”\nHe told the police:\n         “[W]e took the knife out and we went back toward the–back\n         to her where she was lying at we just started stabbing for\n         some reason. Just on the body several times, in the chest\n         maybe, stomach. *** I remember I made a slashing motion\n         by the throat. *** Then we went back to the car. And I–we,\n         we–picked up her clothes. *** Then we were driving, we just\n         started driving ***.”\nDefendant said he threw most of Maney’s belongings on the side of\nthe road. However, he said, alternately: “We just *** I just” buried\n“her panties and her little lingerie stuff.”\n    Defendant murdered a sixth woman, Laura Uylaki, in April of\n1996. Defendant told police he met Uylaki in the winter of 1995-96,\nand they went out a few times. He and Uylaki had sex twice at Wolf\nLake in a sleeping bag defendant kept in the back of his truck. In\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fApril of 1996, defendant again picked up Uylaki and they drove to\nWolf Lake. On the way, they began to argue. According to defendant,\nwhen they arrived at Wolf Lake, defendant took his loaded .38-\ncaliber revolver from underneath the driver’s seat and was “showing\nit to Laura,” when the gun went off, shooting a hole in the roof of the\ntruck. Defendant stated, after his gun went off, “Laura got mad and\nall hell broke loose.”\n     Defendant claimed that Uylaki grabbed for his gun, breaking his\nleft index finger in the process. He said she then jumped out of the\ntruck and began to run. Defendant stated that he followed her and\nfired “a couple more times” in her direction. She fell to the ground.\nWhen he determined that she was dead, he decided to throw her body\ninto the lake. According to defendant’s version of events, he then\ntook off her clothes, carried her body to the lake, and pushed her in.\nThereafter, defendant said he drove back to Chicago, and on the way,\nhe threw Uylaki’s clothes from the passenger side of his truck.\n     Defendant told police he met Lynn Huber, his seventh murder\nvictim, in the summer of 1996, when she was working as a prostitute\nin Chicago. Defendant said they had sex a couple of times that\nsummer. One evening in late July or early August of 1996, defendant\nsaw Huber carrying a large garbage bag full of clothes. He stopped\nand offered her a ride, which she accepted. According to defendant,\nhe pulled into an alley to have sex with Huber, but she started arguing\nwith him and “acting kind of ditzy.” Defendant said that Huber tried\nto get out of the truck, but he grabbed her and shot her in the head,\nusing the loaded gun he kept under his seat.\n     Defendant stated he then put Huber’s body in the bed of the truck\nand drove to Wolf Lake. In defendant’s version of events, he then\nremoved Huber’s clothing and, in the process, pricked his finger with\na needle. Defendant claimed that made him angry enough that he\ntook out a knife, stabbed her “a lot of times” in the back, and shot her\nagain. Defendant dragged her body to the lake and threw her in.\nDefendant later disposed of the clothes Huber had been wearing and\ngave her bag of clothes to the Salvation Army. Defendant observed,\n“[S]he won’t need them anymore.”\n     Defendant told police he killed his eighth and final murder\nvictim, Cassandra Corum, on the night of July 13, 1996. Defendant\nsaid he had known Corum for about two years prior to the murder.\nOn the night of the murder, defendant met Corum in a Hammond,\n\n                                 -32-\n\fIndiana, bar and the two drove to Wolf Lake, where they had sex.\nAccording to defendant, Corum said something that made him\nangry–though he could not remember what–so he hit her in the face\nseveral times with his fist and open hand. Defendant stated that\nCorum started to become afraid and panicked, “so she began to fight\n*** back.” Defendant said it was at that point that he forced Corum’s\nhands behind her back and handcuffed her. He also claimed he then\nremoved her clothing. Defendant told police that Corum “seemed\nnumb with anxiety and fear. So she became passive and submissive.”\nDefendant then bound her feet together with duct tape, put duct tape\nover her mouth, and positioned her so that her head was in his lap.\n    Defendant said he was “still pissed off” so he began driving\nsouth, down Interstate 55. He recalled he had driven “for a couple\nhours or so” when he started getting tired. At that point, he pulled off\nthe interstate and continued driving until he went over a bridge that\ncrossed a river. He then drove into a little park and shut off his truck.\nDefendant claimed he removed the duct tape and handcuffs from\nCorum–though that assertion is inconsistent with the state in which\nher body was found. Defendant said he and the still-naked Corum\nexited the truck. Defendant had gotten his gun from beneath the\ndriver’s seat of his truck. Defendant stated that Corum had walked to\nthe back of the truck, and had turned to face him, as if to say\nsomething, when he pointed the gun at her and fired once. She fell to\nthe ground. Because he was still mad at her for fighting and biting\nhim, he then got his knife out of the truck and stabbed her “a few\ntimes.”\n    Thereafter, defendant picked up her body, carried it to the bridge,\nand dumped the body into the river. He observed that he “didn’t feel\nanything for Cassie *** she was just a whore.” He added that he was\n“trained to kill in the Marine Corps.” Defendant said he drove back\ntowards home, throwing Corum’s clothes out the window on the way.\nHe noted they were “just garbage *** and there was no sense in\nkeeping them.”\n    As noted, much of the foregoing evidence comes from\ndefendant’s own statements to police. At sentencing, Detective Don\nMcGrath of the Chicago police department testified that he escorted\ndefendant back to the lock-up after the interviews. McGrath testified,\nwhen they got to the lock-up door, defendant looked at McGrath and\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fsaid: “Well, you know, I’m kind of glad in a way that you caught me.\n*** I was starting to get the urge again.”\n    When the State had finished presenting aggravating evidence of\ndefendant’s criminal activity, the parties and the court discussed the\ncommencement of the defense case in mitigation. In that regard,\ndefense counsel stated his intention of introducing the psychiatrists’\nreports into evidence and asking that the reports go back to the jury.\nThe State objected to the reports going back to the jury, arguing that\nthe experts should testify in person and “be subject to cross-\nexamination.” The court expressed concern, noting that the reports in\nquestion were “extremely voluminous” and that Dr. Killian’s report\nalone was 75 pages long. The trial judge advised the parties:\n        “I’m not limiting either the direct or cross-examination of a\n        particular expert. So you want to have an expert on the stand\n        for two days, that’s fine with me. You can go over his entire\n        report if you like. *** [I]f all those questions are then asked\n        of a witness, then the opposite side knows what to cross on.\n        *** So the only point I’m making is that there is an unlimited\n        opportunity to inquire of these experts.”\nThe trial court subsequently ruled that the reports would not be sent\nback to the jury, noting, inter alia, “that’s why we have the experts\ntestifying because we are in a realm beyond the normal knowledge\nof the jurors.”\n    With that, the defense commenced its case in mitigation. In\nmitigation, the defendant called Drs. Merikangas and Killian, Kendra\nMoses, a mitigation expert, Roger Cowan, former warden of Menard\nCorrectional Center, and Steven Hardy, a clinical psychologist.\n    Kendra Moses, a defense mitigation specialist, testified regarding\nnegative and positive experiences in defendant’s life and the impact\nof defendant’s conduct on his family. Moses observed that defendant\nwas the youngest of six children. The Urdiales family was “fairly\nclose” prior to defendant’s arrest for the Cook County murders;\nhowever, that is no longer the case. As of the time of trial, the only\nfamily members who regularly visited defendant in prison were his\nparents, his sister, Cynthia, and her son. All of the siblings and\ngrandchildren, except for Cynthia and her son, stopped visiting\ndefendant’s parents once they learned of the Cook County murders.\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f    Moses noted that defendant’s oldest brother, Alfred, was killed\nin Vietnam when defendant was three or four years old. Defendant\nwas “very close” to Alfred. According to family members, defendant\nwould sit on the porch and wait for his brother to come home, not\nunderstanding that his brother had died.\n    Alfred’s death impacted defendant in another sense as well. After\nAlfred was killed, defendant’s mother suffered through an “extended\nperiod” of depression for “two or three years.” She had “trouble\ncontinuing to function in her everyday life.” Moses testified it was\nduring that period of time that defendant’s older sisters, Cynthia and\nMonica, became his primary caretakers.\n    Moses suggested it was “in that environment that Monica\neventually started to sexually abuse” defendant, though it would\nappear that the abuse–reported by defendant to have taken place\nwhen he was 11 years old and Monica was 13 or 14–would have\ntaken place approximately four years after defendant’s mother’s\nperiod of depression. In any event, defendant told his psychologist\nand Moses that Monica had sexually abused him on several occasions\nand the abuse caused him intense feelings of fear and helplessness.\n    Moses further testified that defendant was subjected to bullying,\nbeatings, and harassment from third grade through eighth grade. She\nexplained that the Urdiales family–of Mexican origin–moved to\nBurnham, Illinois, when defendant was in third grade. They were the\nonly family of Hispanic heritage living in the area. That ethnic\ndifference, as well as defendant’s small size and the developing\nsymptoms of Tourette’s syndrome, led to neighborhood children\nharassing, chasing and physically attacking him on his way home\nfrom school. In one instance, the police were called. The harassment\nwas so bad that the family moved back to Chicago when defendant\nwas in high school.\n    Defendant’s parents believed that defendant’s experiences\ngrowing up in Burnham made him “very anxious socially.” He did\nnot develop friendships easily and in fact “had at various times\nmaybe one friend that he would play with or hang out with.” As he\ngot older, defendant was “fearful” around girls and did not date.\n    When defendant graduated from high school, he enlisted in the\nMarines, serving from 1984 until he was honorably discharged in\n1991. Moses described defendant’s experience in the military as “not\n\n\n                                -35-\n\fa failed career,” but certainly “not the success he hoped it would be.”\nMoses indicated that defendant did not make friends in the Marines\nand he had some unspecified difficulties.\n     When defendant was discharged from the Marines, he moved\nback to Chicago, where he lived with his parents. He is the godfather\nof Cynthia’s son, Brian, and the two were described as “very close.”\nMoses testified that defendant had a close relationship with all of his\nnieces and nephews.\n     Finally, Moses testified that defendant did seek counseling\nthrough the Veteran’s Administration after his discharge from the\nMarines. He was referred to psychologist Janet Willer. He advised\nDr. Willer that he needed help dealing with his temper and an\ninferiority complex. He also spoke to Willer about childhood\nharassment, sexual abuse, inability to relate to women, and the death\nof his older brother. Defendant attended over 100 sessions with\nWiller between 1991 and 1995. According to Moses, defendant\nstopped attending sessions when the Veteran’s Administration\nchanged its billing practices and he “didn’t feel like he could afford\nthe copayment.”\n     The defense’s next witness was Roger Cowan, former warden of\nMenard Correctional Center. Defendant was incarcerated at Menard\nat the time of trial. Cowan explained that an inmate who serves a life\nsentence without the possibility of parole would always be housed in\na maximum security facility; an inmate on death row would be\nsegregated from the general population. Cowan described in detail\nthe tight security and highly restrictive conditions that apply to an\ninmate serving a natural life sentence. Cowan characterized\nincarceration at Menard as “a very rigid lifestyle *** very demanding\non the inmates *** a tough life.” He noted that Menard is not air-\nconditioned. Inmates can receive five visits per month, and they get\nfive hours of recreation each week.\n     Cowan noted that defendant had spent seven years in the\ncorrectional system. He had been ticketed only twice: once for\nthrowing his lunch tray from his cell onto the floor; once for failing\nto enter his cell on time. Cowan offered his assessment that defendant\nhad made a “very good adjustment” to prison life.\n     Dr. Stephen Hardy, a clinical psychologist who had worked\nseveral years for both the Department of Corrections and the\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\fDepartment of Mental Health/Human Services, testified that he had\nevaluated defendant on six occasions and had reviewed records\npertinent to defendant’s mental condition. Hardy diagnosed defendant\nwith Tourette’s disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and personality disorder with\navoidant and borderline features. Hardy based the PTSD diagnosis on\ndefendant’s “history of severe sexual and physical abuse involving\nan older sister and neighborhood bullies respectively.” Hardy\nexplained that a PTSD diagnosis based on childhood sexual abuse\ndoes not necessarily have to entail “an event where the person was\nthreatened or suffered serious injury. *** Sexually traumatic events\nmay include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences\nwithout threatened or actual violence or injury.”\n    Concerning the abduction and murder of Cassandra Corum,\nHardy concluded that defendant acted while “under the influence of\nan extreme mental or emotional disturbance but not such to constitute\na defense to the prosecution.” Hardy noted in defendant’s history a\n“clear pattern” involving “chronic feelings of emptiness and\ninappropriate anger and difficulty controlling this anger.”\n    Hardy recognized that defendant “had some difficulties getting\nalong with people, and there were some personal conflicts at work.”\nDefendant consistently displayed an unwillingness to be involved\nwith other people, particularly adult females. Notwithstanding\ndefendant’s “difficulties getting along with people,” Hardy testified\nthat defendant’s potential for acting out violently in prison was low,\nan assessment he based upon the structure of prison and the prison\nauthorities’ ability to quickly intervene should defendant become\nviolent. In that respect, Hardy concluded: “Looking at the\ncircumstances under which he acted out violently in the past,\nexamining the means he had to do so, the characteristics of his past\nvictims, and you combine that with his behavior the past seven years\nin two maximum security environments, I think the potential for him\nto act out violently it’s my opinion is very low.”\n    Hardy acknowledged that defendant would still come into contact\nwith women in prison. He also described an incident during which\ndefendant became very loud and threw some papers while Hardy was\ninterviewing him. Although Hardy did not call the guards, Hardy was\nnonetheless “concerned about it.”\n\n\n                                -37-\n\f     Dr. James Merikangas reiterated much of his testimony from the\nbench trial/GBMI hearing. Commenting on the MRI and the single\nphoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan evidence,\nwhich suggested shrinkage of defendant’s brain, Merikangas\nobserved that such findings were often associated with dementia, loss\nof intellectual capacity, and abnormalities of motor control.\nMerikangas did not believe that defendant’s criminal conduct could\nbe explained simply in terms of inability to control his anger.\nMerikangas concluded: “I would call it rage attacks, I would call it\nimpulse disorder, intermittent explosive disorder. I wouldn’t simply\ncall it anger.” Merikangas stated his belief that antiseizure medication\ncould prevent defendant’s violent outbursts and antipsychotic\nmedication could be used to treat “the disorder of thinking that he\nhas.”\n     Under cross-examination, Merikangas maintained that\ndefendant’s brain “shrinkage” and, inferentially, his “reduced mental\ncapacity[,] *** probably did have something to do with the murders.”\nMerikangas rejected the prosecutor’s suggestion that defendant’s\nactions during the murders showed he had no “coordination\nproblems,” and that he had displayed an “ability to plan,” and select\nas victims women whom he could manipulate, control, and ultimately\nkill. Merikangas insisted that defendant’s actions showed “an\ninability to communicate with women in a normal manner.” When\nthe prosecutor stated that defendant “never had enough guts to do it\nto a man, *** he always had to pick out a woman,” Merikangas\nbrought up “the outburst that he had here in the courtroom, when the\njury wasn’t present, where he turned over the table and went wild\nwith even these guards standing next to him.” Merikangas pointed to\nthat incident as an indication that defendant suffers from a “real loss\nof control.” Inquiring further about defendant’s spontaneous loss of\ncontrol, his impulse disorder, and his intermittent explosive disorder,\nthe following colloquy ensued between the prosecutor and\nMerikangas:\n              “PROSECUTOR: You think carrying around knives and\n          a machete in a rental car in California when he picked up\n          [J.A.], you think that showed a disorder of thought or did it\n          show planning?\n\n\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\f              MERIKANGAS: That shows that he was looking for\n         something but also indicates a certain paranoia to be carrying\n         all those weapons.”\n     The final defense witness was Dr. Terry Killian. Killian testified\nconsistently with his testimony from the bench trial/GBMI hearing,\nfocusing again on the defendant’s mental state and dissociation at the\ntime of Corum’s murder. Killian emphasized, however, that the\ndefendant accepted responsibility for his conduct and did not blame\nit on an alter ego. Killian also believed that defendant’s voluntary\ncounseling sessions with Dr. Willer represented “a good-faith effort”\nto obtain treatment “within the limitations of what I believe he is\ncapable of doing.”\n     Killian’s testimony about defendant’s diagnosis, background,\nfamily history, childhood trauma, and history of mental health\ntreatment was also consistent with his testimony from the bench\ntrial/GBMI hearing. Killian noted that he had reviewed medical\nrecords, arrest reports, and police records, and had conducted over 22\nhours of interviews. Summarizing his findings, Killian explained that\ndefendant was not insane and was responsible for his actions;\nhowever, Killian concluded that defendant suffered from extreme\nmental and emotional disturbances that reduced his mental capacity\nat the time of his offenses. Killian believed that defendant felt some\nremorse for his actions, but, even though it would have been to his\nadvantage to express remorse in death penalty proceedings, defendant\nfeared that expressing remorse would be perceived as self-serving\nand insincere.\n     On cross-examination, Killian testified that he had “reviewed” a\nsentence-completion test administered by Dr. Opsahl when forming\nhis opinion. When the prosecutor handed Killian the sentence-\ncompletion test, and asked if that was the test he had reviewed,\ndefense counsel objected, arguing that the test was not relevant unless\nKillian had relied upon the test in formulating his opinion. The\nprosecutor was then allowed to question Killian as to whether he had\nrelied on the report when forming his opinion. Killian responded:\n              “A. I looked at this, but I didn’t include this, I’m pretty\n         sure I did not include a description of this in my report. I read\n         through it and didn’t see anything that, that was significantly\n         different from what I already knew about him; so I didn’t\n         include the specifics of it.\n\n                                  -39-\n\f            Q. Did you rely upon, at all, in any respect, rely upon, for\n        your opinions here and your assessment of Mr. Urdiales’s\n        personality, did you rely upon any of his answers here?\n            A. I don’t think I did. I don’t think I put much into the\n        sentence completion test. I remember looking at it but not\n        making much of it and setting it aside, and I don’t think I\n        relied on that. I relied on lots of other things but not that test\n        specifically.\n            ***\n            Q. So you don’t recall if some of the answers that he gave\n        on this two-page test helped you formulate that he had this\n        rage towards women?\n            A. I don’t specifically recall. I’d be happy to look at it if\n        you’d like.”\nAfter looking at the report, Killian stated:\n        “Well, they’re consistent with what I already believed about\n        him from everything else I had read. In other words, he does\n        make comments in here about women that are pretty negative.\n        That should hardly be surprising given everything else about\n        him.”\nWhen the prosecutor asked for specifics, defense counsel objected\nand asked to approach the bench. The court announced a brief recess\nand made the following comments out of the presence of the jury:\n        “To cut to the core, the witness is not being responsive, and\n        the right question I don’t believe has been answered. The\n        witness has testified very clearly to the tune of $36,000 that\n        he has gone over with great care all of the materials of a\n        psychiatric nature. The witness has acknowledged that this is\n        among the materials. Now, what the witness has said here, is\n        he has not included it in his report because it is consistent\n        with what he already knew. He has not yet testified that he\n        disregarded it and did not rely on it, but yet he has skirted the\n        issue and not testified that he discarded it and didn’t take it\n        into account in arriving at his decisions. I think we need a\n        vigorous interrogation on foundation by the State to see\n        where this witness goes because he’s going in both\n        directions.”\n\n\n                                  -40-\n\f    In subsequent foundational questioning, out of the presence of the\njury, Killian conceded that he had taken into account all the materials\nplaced before him, and then qualified his answer by adding, “[I]t’s\nnot accurate to say that each piece of paper received the same amount\nof attention as any other piece of paper.” The prosecutor then asked\nif defendant’s answers in the sentence-completion test were\nimportant in his analysis of defendant. Killian responded: “I’m\nanswering this as well as I can.”\n    At that point the court asked Killian if he understood the question,\nand directed him to answer it if he understood. The court advised\nKillian, if he did not understand, he should say so. At the court’s\ndirection, the prosecutor’s question was read back, and Killian\nresponded that he considered defendant’s answers in the sentence-\ncompletion test “somewhat important.” The prosecutor then returned\nto the critical question: “Did you take his answers to these questions\ninto account in arriving at your conclusion?” Killian answered: “Not\nspecifically, I did not include them in my report.” As the prosecutor\nbegan to protest, the court again interceded:\n        “All right. Once again, let me stop you here. Sir, there was a\n        question asked you and you answered a different question.\n        I’m going to have the court reporter read back the question\n        once again. *** I want you to listen to the question that’s\n        asked of you and then I want you to answer that question\n        unless you don’t understand it. Do we understand each\n        other?”\nKillian answered affirmatively. When the question was read back by\nthe court reporter, Killian finally answered, unequivocally: “Yes, I\ntook them into account.” With that, the court determined there was\na sufficient foundation to go into the report before the jury. Before\nthe jury was called back into the courtroom, the court asked attorney\nElmore if there was anything he wanted to contest in terms of that\nruling. Defense counsel responded: “It’s proper, I agree. He took it\ninto account; so, it’s fair game.”\n    Before the jury, Killian again acknowledged that defendant’s\nanswers in the sentence-completion test were considered in his\nassessment of defendant, and defendant’s answers were consistent\nwith defendant’s attitudes toward, and feelings about, women.\nAlthough, at trial, the prosecutor then read aloud the open-ended\nportions of the sentences in the test, and Killian responded by\n\n                                 -41-\n\fsupplying the words defendant used to complete the sentences, we set\nforth here the completed sentences, utilizing hyphens to separate the\ntest portions from defendant’s responses:\n            “Sentence # 2: A wife should–be a good provider.\n            Sentence # 4: A man feels good when–he comes.\n            Sentence # 7: Men are lucky because–we have cocks.\n            Sentence # 8: I just can’t stand people who–get in my\n        face.\n            Sentence # 11: A woman feels good when–we stick it in\n        them.\n            Sentence # 12: My main problem is–people.\n            Sentence # 13: A husband has the right to–beat his wife.\n            Sentence # 14: A woman should always–please her man.\n            Sentence # 19: If I can’t get what I want–I take it.\n            Sentence # 22: My conscience bothers me–if I let it.\n            Sentence # 23: A man should always–be right.\n            Sentence # 25: When I am criticized–I get mad.\n            Sentence # 27: Being with other people–sucks.\n            Sentence # 30: What gets me into trouble is–sex.\n            Sentence # 35: A woman has a right to–be silent.”\nAfter going through the foregoing portions of the sentence-\ncompletion test, the prosecutor asked: “Hates women, doesn’t he?”\nKillian agreed, adding that defendant had “a great deal of anger, and\nmost of that anger is directed at women.”\n     The prosecutor followed up by asking about the sexual abuse that\ndefendant reported involving his sister, Monica. Killian\nacknowledged, on page 73 of his report, he wrote: “There were\napparently only a few incidents of sexual activity between them, and\nAndrew told me that he did not experience the sexual contact with\nMonica as traumatic and he did not even think of it as being wrong\nuntil he was well into his adult years.” Killian, however, disagreed\nwith the prosecutor’s assertion that there “wasn’t any sexual trauma,”\nsuggesting that “it was more traumatic than he currently admits to for\nwhatever reasons.” At the conclusion of Killian’s testimony, outside\nthe presence of the jury, the court ruled that the sentence-completion\ntest would be included in the record, but would not go to the jury.\n\n                                -42-\n\f    After Killian’s testimony, the defense rested. Defendant elected\nnot to testify in his own behalf or deliver a statement in allocution.\n    In rebuttal, the State called Dr. Park Dietz, who testified\nconsistently with his testimony at the bench trial/GBMI hearing.\nPrior to the defense’s stipulation that Dietz was qualified as an expert\n“in the area of forensic psychiatry,” the State elicited testimony that\nDietz had been previously involved in examinations of various high-\nprofile individuals such as John Hinckley, Jeffery Dahmer, and Ted\nKaczynski, also known as the Unibomber. After the defense\nstipulation, Dietz testified to his finding that defendant shows clear\nsigns of a personality disorder with antisocial and schizotypal\nfeatures. Dietz defined a personality disorder as “a lifelong pattern of\nmaladaptive behavior” that “tends to cause impairment” in a person’s\n“relationships with other people.”\n    Dietz believed that three factors may have played a part–to a\ngreater or lesser extent–in defendant’s development of a personality\ndisorder. First and foremost, Dietz felt that the taunting and bullying\ndefendant experienced as a child was a significant factor. Dietz noted\nthat defendant had been “taunted and bullied and teased” as a child,\nand he “blamed his crimes to some extent o[n] what people had done\nto him as a kid because it made him so angry and resentful.” Second,\nDietz believed that the death of defendant’s brother may have\ncontributed to the development of his disorder. Although defendant\ndid not remember his brother, and he did not feel impacted by his\nbrother’s death directly, there was evidence that defendant’s mother\nbecame withdrawn after Alfred’s death, and was “no longer as\nattentive and participatory as a caretaker.” Finally, Dietz mentioned\nthe defendant’s report of sexual intercourse with his sister as a\npossible factor; however, Dietz noted that defendant was not\n“particularly pleased or upset by it. He did not regard this as a very\nimportant aspect of what had happened to him as a child.” Dietz did\nnot believe it was “a particular[ly] traumatic event” for defendant. He\nplaced more importance on the “unavailability” of defendant’s\nmother after his brother’s death.\n    Dietz believed that anger played an important part in all of the\ncrimes committed by defendant, and in his work-related problems as\nwell. Dietz also testified that hatred of women and sexual sadism\nwere significant factors in the commission of defendant’s crimes.\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\f     Under cross-examination, Dietz stated that he normally uses the\nterms “mental illness” or “mental disease” to describe conditions “in\nwhich the person’s experience is categorically different from normal\nhuman experience.” Using the terms in that manner would equate the\nterms to psychosis, and they would thus apply to persons with\n“hallucinations, delusions, or a formal thought disorder.” Dietz\nacknowledged Illinois’ definition of mental illness for purposes of a\nfinding of guilty but mentally ill, and he paraphrased that definition\nfor the jury, i.e., “a substantial disorder of mood, thinking or behavior\nthat impaired judgment at the time of the crime.” Dietz concluded\nthat defendant was not mentally ill when he killed Cassandra Corum.\n     Following Dietz’s testimony, Cassandra Corum’s mother, Sherry\nAlsalah, read a victim impact statement, touching upon the effect\nCorum’s disappearance and murder had had upon her, the victim’s\nsister, and the victim’s young son.\n     Prior to closing argument, the prosecutor sought clarification of\nthe limits of permissible argument, inquiring as to which of the\ncourt’s rulings from the guilt phase would be the subject of proper\ncomment. The prosecutor noted he had “planned on arguing that the\nCourt has previously found the defendant to be sane, not to be\nmentally ill.” The court told the prosecutor: “No. You got to stay\naway from mental illness.” The prosecutor accepted that prohibition\nwithout objection or argument, stating, “That is what I wanted to be\nsure about.” Defense counsel then interjected, “Insanity is fair game.”\nThe court confirmed that insanity was “fair game,” and the parties\ncould discuss that finding, because the court had already advised the\njury of that ruling.\n     In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jurors:\n         “You’re not here to decide the Defendant’s guilt. That has\n         already been decided. The Court decided, Judge Frobish has\n         already decided that the Defendant is guilty of the murder of\n         Cassandra Corum. He also has decided that the Defendant\n         was not, at the time that murder was committed, insane.”\nThe prosecutor subsequently acknowledged that defendant’s mental\ncondition was relevant in the jury’s sentencing decision, noting that\nthe jury would receive instructions pertaining to “extreme mental or\nemotional disturbance” and “reduced mental capacity.”\n\n\n\n                                  -44-\n\f     In his closing statement, defense counsel summarized the\nevidence presented on defendant’s behalf, and took issue with the\nState’s evidence, particularly the testimony of Dr. Dietz. The focal\npoint of the defendant’s closing argument was the defendant’s mental\nand emotional condition. Defense counsel informed the jury it was “a\nfactor in mitigation” that defendant “suffers from a reduced mental\ncapacity.” He suggested there was “[a]bundant testimony concerning\nthat.” Counsel noted it was a mitigating factor that “the murder of\nCassandra Corum was committed while Defendant was under the\ninfluence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance although not\nsuch as to constitute a defense to the prosecution.” Counsel stated he\nhad asked Dr. Dietz to provide a “definition of mental illness,”\nhowever he provided the “definition of insanity.” Attorney Skelton\nunderscored: “As Judge Frobish has told you, insanity is not an issue\nat this stage of the proceeding.” Counsel emphasized that insanity\nwas not at issue and that Dr. Dietz had provided the “wrong\ndefinition of what we’re dealing with at this stage of the case.”\nSkelton observed that the jury had seen photographs evincing the\n“handiwork” of a “sick mind.” He directed the jury to “look at the\nmitigating factors,” noting that defendant “suffers from a mental\nillness” and “had a reduces mental capacity.” Counsel concluded:\n         “What we are talking about here is mitigation. What we are\n         talking about here is does society, do we as a people who do\n         not have the same deficits, the same problems, the same\n         illnesses as Andrew Urdialles, punish the mentally ill in the\n         same fashion that we would punish someone who does not\n         have that mental illness?”\nCounsel suggested that life in prison was the appropriate sentence.\n     In rebuttal argument, the prosecutor reiterated that insanity was\nnot an issue; however, he immediately followed that remark with a\nquestion that unequivocally apprised the jury that mental illness was\nstill an issue: “Is [defendant] mentally ill at some level?” What\nfollowed was a discussion of the evidence and testimony bearing\nupon that issue. The prosecutor’s subsequent remarks also made clear\nthat defendant’s mental state was considered a viable, and perhaps\ndeterminative, factor in the jury’s sentencing decision. We quote\npertinent portions of the prosecutor’s argument:\n         “Extreme mental or emotional disturbance or reduced mental\n         capacity. That’s what you are going to see [in instructions]\n\n                                -45-\n\f        when you decide whether or not you believe that factor in\n        mitigation and because of that its inappropriate to impose a\n        death penalty.\n             ***\n             Reduced mental capacity. *** I pose to you, think about\n        this. *** If this defendant were suffering from such an\n        extreme emotional disturbance and reduced mental capacity,\n        if a cop was at his elbow during all these crimes, he’d still do\n        them because he couldn’t help himself because he’s suffering\n        from those types of mental problems.\n             Does one of you think that if there was a policeman at his\n        elbow when [J.A.] was in that trunk she would have still been\n        in the trunk and that he would have done that? Do you think\n        if a policeman would have been at his elbow that he would\n        have blown the back of Denise Maney’s head off? Do any of\n        you really think that that if there would have been a cop there\n        with him, I’m just emotionally disturbed, I can’t help myself,\n        and he’d do it anyway? Is there a single person that can truly\n        believe that?”\nThe prosecutor noted, even if the jurors believed that defendant was\n“emotionally disturbed” or his “mental capacity was reduced,” they\ncould still “vote to impose the death penalty despite that.”\n    Following the arguments of the parties, the trial court issued final\ninstructions to the jury. The jury was instructed that mitigating\nfactors include:\n             “First: Any or all of the following if supported by the\n        evidence:\n             The murder was committed while the defendant was\n        under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional\n        disturbance, although not such as to constitute a defense to\n        the prosecution.\n             The defendant suffers from a reduced mental capacity.\n             Second: Any other reason supported by the evidence why\n        the defendant should not be sentenced to death.\n             Where there is evidence of a mitigating factor, the fact\n        that such mitigating factor is not a factor specifically listed in\n\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\f        these instructions does not preclude your consideration of the\n        evidence.”\n    During jury deliberations, the jury sent a note asking to see the\nsentence-completion test. The court initially considered whether to\nsend only the portion of the test referred to in the questioning of Dr.\nKillian. The court then inquired, “Should they get the questions that\nwere not asked of Dr. Killian?” Attorney Skelton responded for the\ndefense, “I need to review the entirety of the exhibit before I can\ncomment on that.” After further consideration, attorney Shelton\nstated: “I would suggest that it be sent in its entirety.” Attorney\nElmore concurred. By agreement of the parties, the entire sentence-\ncompletion test was sent to the jury.\n    The jury ultimately determined that death was the appropriate\nsentence. Subsequently, defendant filed a posttrial motion, which was\nconsidered and denied. The court sentenced defendant to death, and\nthis appeal followed.\n\n                              ANALYSIS\n                         Pretrial Proceedings\n              I. Shackling and Other Security Measures\n    Defendant first contends that he was deprived of due process and\nfundamental fairness where the trial court initially ordered\ndefendant’s legs shackled under a skirted table during courtroom\nappearances and later, after defendant created a disturbance in the\ncourtroom, ordered his left arm shackled under the table as well.\nDefendant also argues that he was improperly denied writing utensils\nafter the courtroom disturbance and, in the issue statement of his\nbrief, suggests that the court erred in “instruct[ing] the jury that the\ndefendant was restrained for security reasons.”\n    In response to defendant’s contentions, the State first argues that\ndefendant acquiesced in the trial court’s ordering of restraints and\nforfeited the issue by failing to object at trial or preserve the issue in\na posttrial motion. Beyond that, the State contends that defendant\ncannot obtain relief under the plain error doctrine because there was\nno error.\n    In addressing defendant’s plain error argument, we first “consider\nwhether error occurred at all.” People v. Wade, 131 Ill. 2d 370, 376\n(1989). Applying the principles expressed in People v. Buss, 187 Ill.\n\n                                  -47-\n\f2d 144 (1999)–which remain good law after this court’s decision in\nPeople v. Allen, 222 Ill. 2d 340 (2006), and the Supreme Court’s\nopinion in Deck v. Missouri, 544 U.S. 622, 161 L. Ed. 2d 953, 125 S.\nCt. 2007 (2005)–we conclude that no error occurred as a result of the\ndefendant’s wearing shackles during the proceedings in this case. We\nnote that the trial court made findings sufficient to justify the use of\nphysical restraints, it appears the shackling was not visible to the\njury, and the measures imposed by the trial court did not affect\ndefendant’s ability to assist and communicate with counsel.\n    In People v. Boose, 66 Ill. 2d 261, 265 (1977), this court noted\nthat shackling is generally disfavored because (1) it tends to prejudice\nthe jury against the accused; (2) it restricts the defendant’s ability to\nassist counsel during trial; and (3) it offends the dignity of the\njudicial process. Nonetheless, this court explained that a defendant\nmay be shackled if there is an indication he may try to escape, pose\na threat to the safety of courtroom occupants, or disrupt the order of\nthe courtroom. Boose, 66 Ill. 2d at 266. The Boose court identified\nseveral factors a circuit court should consider in determining whether\nto shackle a defendant, including:\n             “ ‘[T]he seriousness of the present charge against the\n         defendant; defendant’s temperament and character; his age\n         and physical attributes; his past record; past escapes or\n         attempted escapes, and evidence of a present plan to escape;\n         threats to harm others or cause a disturbance; self-destructive\n         tendencies; the risk of mob violence or of attempted revenge\n         by others; the possibility of rescue by other offenders still at\n         large; the size and mood of the audience; the nature and\n         physical security of the courtroom; and the adequacy and\n         availability of alternative remedies.’ ” Boose, 66 Ill. 2d 266-\n         67, quoting State v. Tolley, 290 N.C. 349, 368, 226 S.E.2d\n         353, 368 (1976).\nThe need for shackling is a determination within the discretion of the\ncircuit court. Buss, 187 Ill. 2d at 216. A court of review will examine\nthat decision to determine whether the trial court abused its\ndiscretion. Boose, 66 Ill. 2d 267. Consequently, a trial court\nmust–outside the presence of the jury–place its reasons for shackling\na defendant on the record and provide defense counsel with an\nopportunity to offer reasons why the defendant should not be\nshackled. Buss, 187 Ill. 2d at 216. As this court observed in Buss, a\n\n                                  -48-\n\fsingle reason for shackling has generally been held to be insufficient\njustification for the restraint; whereas, “Illinois courts have found no\nabuse of discretion in shackling a defendant when the circuit court\nhas expressed more than a single reason for shackling a defendant.”\nBuss, 187 Ill. 2d at 216-17 (compiling cases).\n     Perhaps because the trial judge in this case had been subject to\nappellate court criticism in a previous matter, he was particularly\nsensitive to the Boose issue, and he took care to comply with the\nmandated procedure. The court first noted that defendant’s legs\nwould be shackled under a skirted table and that the jurors would not\nbe aware of it unless defendant drew their attention to it. The judge\nasked defense counsel if they had “any objection on the record.”\nCounsel responded that the defense had “no objection to it now.” The\ntrial court then specifically identified three factors to support its\ndecision to shackle defendant’s legs. First, the court observed that\ndefendant had been recently convicted of two murders in Cook\nCounty and had been sentenced to death. Although his death sentence\nwas subsequently commuted, he was, at the time of trial, still serving\ntwo life sentences. Second, the court mentioned defendant’s physical\nattributes, noting that he was in good health and had no difficulty\ngetting around. Third, the court made reference to the age of the\nLivingston County courthouse and stated there were “all kind of\nsecurity problems with the building and the courtroom.” Although the\ncourt did not initially mention the first Boose factor, i.e., the\nseriousness of the charge against defendant, that consideration must\nhave been obvious to all, and the court’s subsequent reference to that\nfactor indicates that it no doubt was significant in the court’s ruling\nat the outset. After the court set forth its reasons for the restraint, the\njudge stated his intention to instruct the jury that “security measures\nhave been taken, such as the guards being here.” With those\ncomments on the restraint of defendant and attendant security\nmeasures, the trial court again asked: “Is there anything else on that\nissue that either the State or the defense wishes to bring up?” For the\ndefense, attorney Skelton responded, “No, sir.”\n     The court then recessed prior to the commencement of jury voir\ndire. During that recess, defendant began cursing and threw a cup of\nwater because a guard, and his own attorney, had instructed him that\nhe could not speak with his parents and Kendra Moses. Defendant\nhad to be physically subdued and handcuffed, and he turned over a\n\n                                   -49-\n\ftable in the process. After the trial judge ascertained what had\nhappened, the court asked defendant: “Will you promise to behave\nyourself if I do not shackle you?” Defendant gave no explicit\nassurances, stating only, through counsel, that he had not been\nshackled in the prior Cook County proceedings, and there had been\nno outbursts or problems. The court then made the additional\nobservation: “[Y]ou are on trial here for your life.” As a result of the\noutburst, the court ordered defendant’s left arm shackled under the\ntable as well and directed that defendant be given no pencils or pens.\n     Two days later, in chambers, the court revisited the issue of\nsecurity. The court observed that two “very large guards” had been\nnecessary to restrain defendant “notwithstanding that he was already\nshackled to an eye bolt on the floor.” The judge described\ndefendant’s conduct and characterized it as going “ballistic” or\n“berserk.” Attorney Elmore, for the defense, acknowledged that the\ncourt had not overstated the severity of the incident. The court then\nstated that defendant was a “high risk individual” and noted that his\ndemeanor had changed after it became clear that the trial was\n“actually going to go forward finally.” The judge stated his belief that\ndefendant was a “desperate man.” With those additional observations,\nbearing upon the second and sixth factors mentioned in Boose (see\nBoose, 66 Ill. 2d at 266-67 (“ ‘defendant’s temperament and\ncharacter’ ” and “ ‘threats to harm others or cause a disturbance’ ”),\nquoting State v. Tolley, 290 N.C. 349, 368, 226 S.E.2d 353, 368\n(1976)), the court again asked defense counsel: “[D]o you want me\nto free up Mr. Urdiales more than I am contemplating doing?”\nAttorney Skelton initially responded by asking that the court\nreconsider its decision to deny defendant a writing implement. The\ncourt then stated: “DOC has had in the past inch pencils. *** It’s a\nvery small pencil. We’ll explore that and come up with a writing\nmaterial that couldn’t do you harm.” Other than that single request,\ndefense counsel did not object to the security measures ordered by\nthe court, and in fact concluded his remarks on the subject by\nimplicitly agreeing that the court’s measures were appropriate under\nthe circumstances, stating, “I know what the court’s talking about.\nI’ve been there.”\n     We find that the trial court set forth more of record than was\nnecessary to justify the physical restraints and security measures it\nutilized. The court gave the defense an opportunity to offer reasons\n\n                                 -50-\n\fwhy defendant should not be shackled, and the defense in effect\nconceded that the court’s actions were appropriate. The use of\nphysical restraints, which were not visible to the jury, did not impair\ndefendant’s ability to communicate with counsel and assist in his\ndefense. In short, we find that the court acted appropriately, and did\nnot abuse its discretion in this regard.\n     Although we believe the court would have been justified in\ndenying defendant writing implements, and such a deprivation would\nnot have affected his ability to communicate with counsel–who was\nsitting right next to defendant–the record does not support\ndefendant’s contention that the court actually denied defendant the\nmeans to write. There is no indication in the record that the court did\nnot, ultimately, “come up with a writing material that couldn’t do\n[defense counsel] harm.” We note that an appellant has the burden of\npresenting the court with an adequate record regarding a claimed\nerror, and any doubts arising from an inadequate record will be\nresolved against him. See Redmond v. Socha, 216 Ill. 2d 622, 631\n(2005); Haudrich v. Howmedica, Inc., 169 Ill. 2d 525, 546-47 (1996).\n     Although defendant, in the issue statement of his brief, claims\nthat the court erred in “instruct[ing] the jury that the defendant was\nrestrained for security reasons,” defendant misrepresents the trial\njudge’s statement, apparently in an attempt to link it to his shackling\nargument. The court did not tell jurors that defendant was\n“restrained.” Rather, the court advised jurors that defendant was “in\ncustody” and “certain security measures” had been taken. While that\nadmonishment might have been the basis for an argument in and of\nitself, defendant’s brief includes no argument or citation of authority\nbearing upon either the trial court’s actual statement to the jury or the\nstatement as he misrepresents it. A point raised in an appellant’s brief\nmust be supported by argument and relevant legal authority. People\nv. Davis, 213 Ill. 2d 459, 470 (2004); People v. Jackson, 205 Ill. 2d\n247, 278 (2001). Failure to comply with those requirements results\nin forfeiture. People v. Ward, 215 Ill. 2d 317, 332 (2005); Davis, 213\nIll. 2d at 470; Jackson, 205 Ill. 2d at 278. Defendant has forfeited the\nissue.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -51-\n\f           II. Remarks Regarding Appellate Court Opinions\n    Defendant next contends that he was “deprived of due process\nand fundamental fairness where the [trial] judge disparaged various\njustices of the Illinois appellate court, expressed contempt for recent\nappellate opinions restricting a trial court’s authority to shackle or\nrestrain defendants, and indicated he would mail a transcript\nregarding the defendant’s single courtroom disruption to appellate\nand supreme court justices who potentially would review this case on\nappeal.” Defendant cites this court’s decision in In re Dominique F.,\n145 Ill. 2d 311 (1991), for the proposition that “[i]t is unacceptable\nfor a trial judge to disregard *** precedent because he disagrees with\nit.” We find that the trial judge in this case registered his\ndisagreement with precedent, but he did not disregard it.\n    As previously noted, perhaps because the trial judge in this case\nhad been subject to appellate court criticism in a previous matter, he\nwas particularly sensitive to the Boose issue, and he took care to\ncomply with the mandated procedure. The trial court set forth more\nof record than was necessary to justify the physical restraints and\nsecurity measures it utilized. Thus, defendant was not denied due\nprocess or fundamental fairness by the court’s comments, all of\nwhich were made outside the presence of the jury.\n    We do not, however, mean to encourage the kind of rambling,\namorphous diatribe in which the trial court engaged. While restrained\nand reasoned disagreement with the ruling of a superior court is not\nto be discouraged, and may well be constructive in a proper setting,\nas our appellate court has observed, dignity is necessary for judicial\nproceedings. See People v. Thurmond, 317 Ill. App. 3d 1133, 1145\n(2000). As the appellate court noted in Thurmond, a trial judge\nshould be the exemplar of dignity, he should exercise restraint over\nhis conduct and utterances, and should control his emotions.\nThurmond, 317 Ill. App. 3d at 1145. We trust that the judge in this\ncase will, in the future, circumscribe his conduct and comments so as\nto reflect the dignity his office, in particular, and that of the judicial\nsystem, of which he is but one part.\n\n               III. Involvement of DPTA Attorneys\n   Defendant next contends that he was deprived of due process and\nfundamental fairness because the trial court “disparaged the motives\n\n                                  -52-\n\fand conduct of attorneys for the State Appellate Defender Death\nPenalty Trial Assistance Unit, who were an integral part of the\ndefense team representing Andrew Urdiales.” Defendant states that\nthe trial court’s “expressed animosity” may indicate that the judge\nwas not “impartial.” Defendant also argues: “Once [the trial judge]\nappointed the Appellate Defender and Mr. Richards, the trial judge\nhad no authority to preclude Mr. Richards from assigning his\nassistants to the case, or to strike Mr. Hanlon and Mr. Sincox from\nthe entry of appearance.” Moreover, defendant submits that the court\nexcluded Sincox because the court “objected to his demeanor” and\nthe court had “no inherent authority to discipline” Sincox in that\nmanner. We begin this portion of our analysis with a review of the\npertinent statutes.\n     Section 10 of the State Appellate Defender Act prescribes the\npowers and duties of the State Appellate Defender (725 ILCS 105/10\n(West 2004)), and applies to all attorneys employed by the Office of\nthe State Appellate Defender (OSAD) (725 ILCS 105/2 (2) (West\n2004)). The Act governs the circumstances under which the State\nAppellate Defender may be appointed to represent defendants in any\ngiven case (Kirwan v. Welch, 133 Ill. 2d 163, 164-65 (1989)), and the\nattorneys of that agency may represent defendants “only as the Act\nprovides.” (Emphasis in original.) Kirwan v. Karns, 119 Ill. 2d 431,\n434 (1988); see also Alexander v. Pearson, 354 Ill. App. 3d 643, 647\n(2004).\n     The State points out that the version of the State Appellate\nDefender Act in effect at the time of defendant’s trial did not\n“mandate” that an attorney from OSAD be allowed to file his or her\nappearance as trial counsel in a death penalty case and participate in\nthat capacity. Our reading of the statute in question indicates that it\ndid not even authorize OSAD attorneys to act as trial counsel in\ncapital cases, much less “mandate” that they be allowed to do so. See\n725 ILCS 105/10(a), (b)(5) (West 2004) (“The State Appellate\nDefender shall represent indigent persons on appeal *** when\nappointed to do so by a court under a Supreme Court Rule or law of\nthis State. *** The Office of the State Appellate Defender shall not\nbe appointed to serve as trial counsel in capital cases”). In fact, a\nliteral reading of the pertinent statute indicates it did not even\nauthorize the assistance of attorneys from OSAD. Section 10(c)(5)\nof the applicable version of the Act stated in relevant part:\n\n                                 -53-\n\f            “(c) The State Appellate Defender may:\n                 (5) in cases in which a death sentence is an authorized\n            disposition, provide trial counsel with the assistance of\n            expert witnesses, investigators, and mitigation specialists\n            from funds appropriated to the State Appellate Defender\n            specifically for that purpose by the General Assembly.\n            The Office of State Appellate Defender shall not be\n            appointed to serve as trial counsel in capital cases.”\n            (Emphasis added.) 725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West 2004).\nUnder a literal reading of the provision, the statute allowed the State\nAppellate Defender to provide only “the assistance of expert\nwitnesses, investigators, and mitigation specialists.”\n     Of course, with the passage of Public Act 94–340, effective\nJanuary 1, 2006, the State Appellate Defender Act was amended to\nspecifically allow the State Appellate Defender to provide trial\ncounsel in capital cases with “legal advice,” in addition to the\nservices previously authorized (725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West Supp.\n2005)), and the Capital Crimes Litigation Act was amended to\nprovide as follows: “At the request of court appointed counsel [in\ncapital cases], attorneys employed by the State Appellate Defender\nmay enter an appearance for the limited purpose of assisting counsel\nappointed under this Section.” 725 ILCS 124/5 (West Supp. 2005).\n     Although the amended versions of the State Appellate Defender\nAct and the Capital Crimes Litigation Act were not in effect at the\ntime of his trial, defendant simply proceeds in his argument as if they\nwere. He does not argue that those provisions apply retroactively; he\ndoes not advance reasons why they should apply retroactively; and\nhe cites no relevant authority in that regard. Thus, defendant has\nforfeited any contention that the amended provisions apply. See\nPeople v. Mertz, 218 Ill. 2d 1, 91 (2005) (defendant’s failure to offer\nanalysis and cite legal authority in support of retroactive application\nresulted in forfeiture of the issue). We thus examine defendant’s\ncontentions utilizing the statutes in effect at the time of defendant’s\ntrial–the provisions presumably known to the presiding trial judge.\n     Those provisions did not, by their terms, authorize OSAD\nattorneys to serve as counsel in capital cases or provide legal advice\nto the attorneys actually serving as trial counsel. If they did, it would\nhardly seem necessary to amend section 10(c)(5) of the State\n\n\n                                  -54-\n\fAppellate Defender Act to specifically so state, and that is exactly\nwhat Public Act 94–340 did. See 725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West Supp.\n2005) (adding the phrase “legal advice”). The version of the Act in\neffect at the time of trial, and the current version, both state that the\n“State Appellate Defender shall not be appointed to serve as trial\ncounsel in capital cases.” Compare 725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West\n2004) with 725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West Supp. 2005). That provision\nis at once a prohibition directed to circuit courts and to the attorneys\nof OSAD. Trial courts are not to appoint attorneys of that agency to\nserve as trial counsel in capital cases, and attorneys of that agency are\nnot statutorily authorized to serve in that capacity. The State\nAppellate Defender Act governs the circumstances in which the\nattorneys of that state agency are authorized to render their state-\nsupported services. They are not free agents who can act as counsel\nwhen and where they see fit.\n     That is not to say that the unauthorized actions of an OSAD\nattorney on behalf of a criminal defendant are a nullity. After all, the\nattorney who chooses to exceed his statutory authorization, and is\nallowed to do so by a trial court, is nonetheless a licensed attorney,\nand his actions will be judged by the standards applicable to any\nlicensed attorney acting in that context. However, such an attorney\nhas no right to interject himself, or herself, into the trial.\n     Applying those principles to this case, it is clear that the trial\ncourt was not required to allow OSAD attorneys to participate as\n“part of the defense team.” In fact, the court should not have allowed\nRichards to participate. Defendant was fortunate to receive the able\nservices of Richards, but he was not statutorily entitled to them.\n     Because Sincox and Hanlon were not statutorily authorized to\nparticipate as defendant’s attorneys in this case, and the trial judge\nwas not required to allow them to do so, the judge did not err in\nstriking their names from the entry of appearance filed by Richards.\nFor the same reasons–and irrespective of the concerns actually\nexpressed by the court–there would have been no error in precluding\nSincox from participating in the deposition of Dietz.\n     However, the record indicates the court never denied defendant’s\nmotion for Sincox to participate in that deposition. Defendant’s trial\nattorney, Elmore, appeared to agree with the court’s statement that\nthe defense motion was moot because Elmore and Skelton planned\nto travel to California for the deposition, and, in any event, defense\n\n                                  -55-\n\fcounsel never obtained a ruling on the motion. A movant has the\nresponsibility to obtain a ruling on his motion if he is to avoid\nforfeiture on appeal. People v. Redd, 173 Ill. 2d 1, 35 (1996).\nBecause defendant did not obtain a ruling, the issue is forfeited.\n     The court’s comments about Sincox’s behavior in the\ncourtroom–though apparently warranted–are irrelevant, given that\nSincox did not, and could not, represent the defendant. We note that\nthe court’s remarks regarding the attorneys who actually represented\nthe defendant were highly complimentary, and there was no hint of\nanimosity or disparagement therein. None of the court’s comments\nto or about the attorneys were made in the presence of the jury.\n     We are compelled to comment on one remark the court made\nabout attorneys Richards and Sincox. At one point, during a\ndiscussion of the contemplated deposition of Dr. Dietz in California,\nthe trial court expressed concern that attorneys Sincox and Richards\nhad “an agenda far greater than” the defendant’s case. Later, in that\nsame discussion, the trial judge specified the nature of his concern,\nfocusing on attorney Sincox. Referring specifically to Sincox, whose\npossible participation in the anticipated deposition had been broached\nby attorney Skelton, the court stated:\n         “His conduct in this courtroom was most unprofessional. It is\n         clear to me that he has an agenda far greater than Mr.\n         Urdiales and he is motivated by that. And I am concerned that\n         his conduct will be governed by that. *** And if he goes far\n         afield out there, we have got a mess on our hands in terms of,\n         well, now the deposition wasn’t completed.”\n     Clearly, although the court included attorney Richards in his\ninitial remark, the comment was prompted by the suggestion that\nSincox participate in the deposition of Dietz. We note that attorney\nRichards was otherwise treated with respect and consideration by the\ncourt in all of the pretrial proceedings in which he participated. We\nsee no evidence of prejudice with respect to him. With respect to\nSincox, the record suggests that the court may have had good reason\nto mistrust him and question his professionalism.\n     In any event, placed in context, the judge’s initial statement, and\nhis subsequent expansive comments, appear to reflect the court’s\njustifiable concern that the admittedly broader agenda of the DPTA\nmight result in questioning “far afield” in areas not particularly\n\n\n                                 -56-\n\fpertinent to defendant’s case, resulting in an unnecessary delay and\ndocketing problems. We believe those were valid considerations.\n    We note that allegations of judicial bias or prejudice must be\nviewed in context and should be evaluated in terms of the trial\njudge’s specific reaction to the events taking place. People v.\nJackson, 205 Ill. 2d 247, 277 (2001). The fact that a judge displays\ndispleasure or irritation with an attorney’s behavior is not necessarily\nevidence of judicial bias against the defendant or his counsel.\nJackson, 205 Ill. 2d at 277. As noted, the report of proceedings\nreveals nothing in the way of judicial displeasure or irritation with\nRichards. Since Sincox was not allowed to serve as counsel for\ndefendant, or represent him in any way, we need not consider the\npossible repercussions of the court’s interaction with Sincox. In short,\nthe court’s conduct with respect to the DPTA attorneys did not deny\ndefendant due process.\n\n                               Guilt Phase\n                      Guilty Plea and Bench Trial\n    Defendant next contends that the trial court abused its discretion\nin rejecting his plea of guilty but mentally ill, and, in a related claim,\nargues that the trial court’s bench trial verdict of guilty, “rather than\nguilty but mentally ill,” was against the manifest weight of the\nevidence. The relief defendant requests in each instance is “a new\nsentencing hearing.” Defendant suggests he is “entitled to a new\ncapital sentencing hearing because the trial court’s rejection of his\nGBMI plea tainted the weight and credibility of his mitigation\nevidence” at his sentencing hearing. We begin this section of our\nanalysis with a review of the applicable statutes and this court’s\npertinent opinions.\n    The pertinent version of section 6–2 of the Criminal Code of\n1961 provides:\n            “(c) A person who, at the time of the commission of a\n        criminal offense, was not insane but was suffering from a\n        mental illness, is not relieved of criminal responsibility for\n        his conduct and may be found guilty but mentally ill.\n            (d) For purposes of this Section, ‘mental illness’ or\n        ‘mentally ill’ means a substantial disorder of thought, mood,\n        or behavior which afflicted a person at the time of the\n\n                                  -57-\n\f         commission of the offense and which impaired that person’s\n         judgment, but not to the extent that he is unable to appreciate\n         the wrongfulness of his behavior or is unable to conform his\n         conduct to the requirements of law.” 720 ILCS 5/6–2(c), (d)\n         (West 1994).\nThe burden is on the defendant to prove, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that he was mentally ill, as defined in subsections (c) and\n(d) of section 6–2. 725 ILCS 5/115–3(c)(3), 115–4(j) (West 2004);\nPeople v. Lantz, 186 Ill. 2d 243, 254 (1999). When a trier of fact\nfinds a defendant guilty but mentally ill, that verdict does not relieve\na defendant of criminal responsibility. People v. Johnson, 146 Ill. 2d\n109, 131 (1991). A defendant who has been found guilty but mentally\nill is subject to any sentence that could have been imposed upon a\ndefendant who had been convicted of the same offense without a\nfinding of mental illness, including the death penalty. Johnson, 146\nIll. 2d at 131-32. Indeed, the only discernible difference between the\ntwo verdicts is that, upon a finding of guilty but mentally ill, the\nDepartment of Corrections must “cause periodic inquiry and\nexamination to be made concerning the nature, extent, continuance,\nand treatment of the defendant’s mental illness” and provide “such\npsychiatric, psychological, or other counseling and treatment for the\ndefendant as it determines necessary.” 730 ILCS 5/5–2–6(b) (West\n2004); see People v. Morris, 237 Ill. App. 3d 140, 145 (1992). As is\nthe case when a defendant raises a defense of insanity, for which a\ndefendant also bears the burden of proof, the existence of “mental\nillness,” as defined in section 6–2, is a question of fact; thus, the trial\ncourt’s resolution of that issue will not be overturned unless it is\ncontrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. See Johnson, 146 Ill.\n2d at 128-29.\n     The Criminal Code also provides for a plea of guilty but mentally\nill. Section 115–2 of the Criminal Code governs pleas of guilty, as\nwell as pleas of guilty but mentally ill. Subsection (b) of section\n115–2 provides that a plea of guilty but mentally ill “may be\naccepted” by the court when, inter alia:\n             “(3) the judge has held a hearing, at which either party\n         may present evidence, on the issue of the defendant’s mental\n         health and, at the conclusion of such hearing, is satisfied that\n         there is a factual basis that the defendant was mentally ill at\n         the time of the offense to which the plea is entered.” 725\n         ILCS 5/115–2(b)(3) (West 2004).\n\n                                   -58-\n\f    Defendant initially argues that the trial court erred when it\nrejected his plea of guilty but mentally ill and, in doing so, “decided\nthat the legal standards for determining a factual basis for a\ntraditional plea *** were inapplicable to determining the factual basis\nfor pleas of guilty but mentally ill.” Citing this court’s decision in\nPeople v. Sorenson, 196 Ill. 2d 425 (2001), defendant maintains that\nthis aspect of his argument presents a purely legal question subject to\nde novo review. We agree with defendant as to the applicable\nstandard of review. However, we otherwise reject the substance of his\nargument.\n    Defendant notes that the language of subsection (b) of section\n115–2, i.e., “may be accepted,” substantially mirrors the language of\nsubsection (a), which addresses “the traditional guilty plea.” Ergo,\ndefendant argues that cases interpreting standards applicable to\nsubsection (a) should provide guidance as to the proper interpretation\nof subsection (b). Defendant conveniently overlooks a significant\ndifference between the procedures set forth in subsections (a) and (b).\nSubsection (b) appears to provide for a contested hearing “on the\nissue of defendant’s mental health,” a hearing “at which either party\nmay present evidence.” Notwithstanding this difference, defendant\nmaintains that proceedings on a plea of guilty but mentally ill should\nbe governed by the identical principles applicable to “the traditional\nguilty plea,” and cites this court’s decision in People v. Barker, 83 Ill.\n2d 319, 328 (1980), for the following proposition:\n        “In evaluating the sufficiency of the factual basis to support\n        a plea of guilty, a trial judge is in much the same position and\n        would apply similar standards as those used in determining\n        the sufficiency of the State’s evidence at trial to withstand a\n        motion for a directed verdict of not guilty.”\nDefendant’s argument suggests that the trial court was obligated to\naccept his plea, and thus find he was “mentally ill” as defined in\nsection 6–2 of the Criminal Code, if defendant presented some\nevidence to support such a finding, irrespective of evidence to the\ncontrary presented by the State. Defendant’s position is untenable.\n    It would seem self-evident that a proceeding in which there are\nno contested issues may be subject to different standards than one in\nwhich a controversy exists. In this case, the State chose to dispute the\nexistence of “mental illness,” as defined in section 6–2 of the\nCriminal Code. Because there was a dispute regarding an element of\nthe guilty plea, this case does not present a “traditional guilty plea,”\n\n                                  -59-\n\fwe are not concerned with one party’s evidence alone, and the\nstandard for sufficiency referenced in the quoted passage from\nBarker cannot ultimately apply. Whether evidence could support a\nparticular finding or verdict (the inquiry upon a motion for directed\nverdict) is a different question from whether the evidence does in fact\nsupport that finding or verdict after a full evidentiary hearing. See\nPeople v. Connolly, 322 Ill. App. 3d 905, 915 (2001). In the latter\ninstance, the trier of fact necessarily weighs all the evidence and\npasses upon the credibility of witnesses in resolving disputed issues.\nConnelly, 322 Ill. App. 3d at 915. Because the State contested the\nexistence of mental illness, that is what the trial court was obligated\nto do in this case.\n     Acceptance of defendant’s argument would allow defendants who\nplead guilty but mentally ill to effectively evade the burden of proof\nthat the legislature has placed upon those who raise the issue at trial.\nThe legislature could not have intended such a result. As we have\nnoted, a defendant whose case is tried would have to establish, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that he or she is mentally ill, as\ndefined in subsections (c) and (d) of section 6–2. 725 ILCS\n5/115–3(c)(3), 115–4(j) (West 2004). A preponderance of the\nevidence is evidence that renders a fact more likely than not. Lyon v.\nDepartment of Children & Family Services, 209 Ill. 2d 264, 279\n(2004); see Lindsey v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 354\nIll. App. 3d 971, 986 (2004). Thus, at trial, following the presentation\nof evidence by both the defendant and the State, a trial court would\nhave to determine whether it was “more likely than not” that\ndefendant suffered from a mental illness, as defined in the statute, at\nthe time he or she committed the offense. A defendant pleading guilty\nbut mentally ill should have the same burden of proof. He cannot\nabsolve himself of that burden by admitting an element he has the\nburden of proving. The directed verdict standard, mentioned in\nBarker, cannot apply to a contested proceeding, where evidence is\nadduced to controvert defendant’s claim of mental illness.\n     We also find meritless defendant’s claim that the trial court erred\nin rejecting his plea of guilty but mentally ill, and his contention that\nthe trial court’s verdict of guilty, as opposed to guilty but mentally ill,\nwas against the manifest weight of the evidence. As the foregoing\nanalysis indicates, defendant had the burden of proving his mental\nillness by a preponderance of the evidence. As our subsequent\n\n\n                                   -60-\n\fdiscussion will show, the court’s determination, that he did not\nsustain that burden, was not against the weight of the evidence.\n     As Illinois courts have noted, the credibility and weight to be\ngiven psychiatric testimony are matters for the trier of fact, who is\nnot obligated to accept the opinions of defendant’s expert witnesses\nover those opinions presented by the State. People v. Mahaffey, 166\nIll. 2d 1, 18 (1995); see People v. Dresher, 364 Ill. App. 3d 847, 855-\n56 (2006). In fact, “[e]ven if several competent experts concur in\ntheir opinion and no opposing expert testimony is offered, it is still\nwithin the province of the trier of fact to weigh the credibility of the\nexpert evidence and to decide the issue *** in light of all of the facts\nand circumstances of the case ***” In re Glenville, 139 Ill. 2d 242,\n251 (1990).\n     In this case, the trial court found that defendant had not\nestablished, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was mentally\nill, as defined in section 6–2, when he killed Cassandra Corum. In\nannouncing that ruling, the trial judge stated he found the testimony\nof Dr. Dietz “substantially more persuasive and more convincing than\nthat of the defense experts.” However, the court also found the facts\nof the case themselves a compelling refutation of testimony given by\nthe defense experts.\n     As previously noted, Dietz testified that defendant suffered\nprincipally from a personality disorder, and he displayed obvious\ncharacteristics of a sexual sadist. Dietz did not consider personality\nor anxiety disorders to be mental illnesses, as defined in section 6–2\nof the Criminal Code. He believed that defendant’s criminal behavior\nwas driven by sexual desire, anger, and “a kind of predatory desire\nfor conquest.” If defendant’s judgment was impaired, Dietz believed\nthose were the factors causing impairment, not mental illness. Dietz\nalso rejected Merikangas’ diagnosis of organic brain disease, noting\nthat defendant’s 2004 MRI was within the normal range, and\ndefendant’s actions at the time of Corum’s murder did not bespeak\nsomeone who suffered from significant impairment of the central\nnervous system. Dietz noted that the murder required\nplanning–defendant brought handcuffs, duct tape, a knife, and a gun\nwith him–a certain degree of physical prowess and\ncoordination–defendant was able to overpower Corum, drive her 100\nmiles, murder her, and carry her body to a bridge, where he threw her\ninto the river–and rational thought–insofar as defendant decided to\n\n\n                                 -61-\n\fdrive Corum to a secluded location, where he could kill her without\nbeing observed.\n     The trial court observed that the principal defense witnesses\ndisagreed in their primary diagnoses. Cuneo believed that defendant\nsuffered, primarily, from PTSD; Killian’s principal diagnosis was\ndissociation; and Merikangas determined that defendant suffered\nfrom organic brain disease. Merikangas disagreed with Killian’s and\nCuneo’s diagnoses of PTSD and dissociative personality disorder.\nKillian and Cuneo believed that defendant was legally sane, but\nmentally ill, as defined in section 6–2(d). Merikangas testified that\ndefendant was insane.\n     In addition to their conflicting diagnoses, the court noted that the\ntestimony of defendant’s experts also failed to account for\ndefendant’s ability to function adequately in the Marine Corps, and\nlater as a security guard, while suffering from the diagnosed illnesses.\nTheir diagnoses failed to explain how a person thus afflicted could\nsuccessfully plan, execute, and conceal eight murders over a period\nof 10 years. Disagreeing with the assessments of Merikangas and\nKillian–that defendant’s crimes were not characterized by planning\nand organization–the court noted that defendant brought a gun, a\nknife, duct tape, and handcuffs on the night of Corum’s murder. The\ncourt believed that defendant’s actions during the offense were\ninconsistent with those of a person overcome by anger, noting, on the\nnight defendant killed Cassandra Corum, he drove well over an hour,\nand approximately 100 miles, after he supposedly became angry and\nkidnapped her. It would appear that defendant had time to cool off;\nbut defendant killed Corum anyway.\n     We have held that a judgment is against the manifest weight of\nthe evidence when an opposite conclusion is apparent, or when the\nfindings appear to be unreasonable, arbitrary or not based on the\nevidence. Rhodes v. Illinois Central Gulf R.R., 172 Ill. 2d 213, 242\n(1996). After careful review of this record, we cannot say that the\ntrial court’s rulings in this regard were against the manifest weight of\nthe evidence. Although defendant argues that Dietz’s definition of\nmental illness was unduly restrictive and his views diverged from\nthose generally accepted in the psychiatric community, a review of\nan expert opinion recently rendered in another capital case would\nseem to refute defendant’s position.\n     We note the testimony of Dr. Andrew Kowalkowski, as\nsummarized in People v. Thompson, 222 Ill. 2d 1 (2006). Like Dr.\n\n                                  -62-\n\fDietz, Kowalkowski believed that mental disorders or illnesses are\ncharacterized by evidence of delusions, false fixed beliefs, or\nmisinterpretation of external reality. Thompson, 222 Ill. 2d at 24-25.\nKowalkowski differentiated such “delusional disorders” from\n“behavioral” disorders, such as personality disorders, which are “not\nsignificant mental disorders.” (Emphasis in original.) Thompson, 222\nIll. 2d at 39. Kowalkowski believed that Thompson’s personality\ndisorder “manifested itself in *** his impulsiveness, his irritability\nand aggressiveness, his repeated failure to maintain consistent work\nbehavior and his lack of remorse.” Thompson, 222 Ill. 2d at 25.\nKowalkowski testified that Thompson’s killing spree could be\nexplained by his personality disorders. Thompson, 222 Ill. 2d at 40.\n     The similarities between Dietz’s and Kowalkowski’s diagnoses,\nand Thompson’s and this defendant’s symptoms, are so obvious as\nto require no further comment. Dietz’s opinion does not appear to be\nout of the mainstream of his profession, and it finds support in the\nfacts of record. As the trial court’s ruling suggests, the attendant facts\nand circumstances of defendant’s crimes are themselves a compelling\nrefutation of testimony given by the defense experts, independent of\nDietz’s testimony. For the foregoing reasons, we find no basis for\nreversing the trial court’s determination that defendant failed to\nsustain his burden on the issue of mental illness.\n     We would add, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the\ncircuit court erred in rejecting defendant’s plea of guilty but mentally\nill, defendant is not entitled to a new sentencing hearing, as he argues\nbefore this court. As we will explain later, the circuit court’s rejection\nof defendant’s plea did not affect defendant’s ability to present\nmitigating evidence of his mental condition at sentencing, and\nreferences to defendant’s unsuccessful insanity defense were proper\nand duly circumscribed.\n\n                              Sentencing\n       I. Ruling Regarding the Admission of Experts’ Reports\n    Defendant next claims that the trial court deprived him of his\nright to present relevant mitigating evidence to the sentencing jury\nwhen the court denied defense counsel’s request to provide the jury\nwith the defense experts’ written reports. Quoting People v. Davis,\n185 Ill. 2d 317, 344 (1998), defendant observes that “the State cannot\nplace any limitation on the admission of relevant and reliable\n\n\n                                  -63-\n\fevidence offered in mitigation at a death penalty hearing” and “the\nsentencing authority, whether judge or jury, may not refuse to\nconsider such mitigating evidence as a matter of law.” As the State\npoints out, the trial court’s ruling was a limitation only on the method\ndefendant could use to present evidence, not on the admission of\nevidence itself.\n    When defense counsel stated his intention of introducing\npsychiatrists’ reports into evidence, and asked that the reports go\nback to the jury, the State objected, arguing that the experts should\ntestify in person and “be subject to cross-examination.” The court\nexpressed concern, noting that the reports in question were\n“extremely voluminous” and that Dr. Killian’s report alone was 75\npages long. The trial judge then advised the parties:\n         “I’m not limiting either the direct or cross-examination of a\n         particular expert. So you want to have an expert on the stand\n         for two days, that’s fine with me. You can go over his entire\n         report if you like. *** [I]f all those questions are then asked\n         of a witness, then the opposite side knows what to cross on.\n         *** So the only point I’m making is that there is an unlimited\n         opportunity to inquire of these experts.”\nThe trial court subsequently ruled that the reports would not go to the\njury, noting, inter alia, “that’s why we have the experts testifying\nbecause we are in a realm beyond the normal knowledge of the\njurors.” The court’s statement evinces its concern that, in the absence\nof explanatory expert testimony, psychiatric reports in the hands of\nthe jurors could have been a source of misunderstanding, confusion,\nand unchallenged opinion evidence.\n    We find no error in the circuit court’s ruling. No restrictions were\nplaced on defendant’s right to present relevant evidence. The court\nmade clear that defendant could call an expert and “go over his entire\nreport” if defendant chose to do so. The limitation the court placed on\nthe method for introducing that evidence appears, in part, to have\nbeen for the purpose of safeguarding the opposing party’s right of\nconfrontation and cross-examination, and in part to ensure that the\njury received adequate explanatory testimony. We find that the\ncourt’s ruling was reasonable and entirely proper.\n    Defendant could have called any of his experts he deemed\nnecessary. Presumably, he called those whom he believed were\nimportant to his defense. Moreover, defendant could have questioned\n\n\n                                 -64-\n\fthe experts he did call about specific information contained in a\nnontestifying expert’s report, so long as the former relied upon\ninformation contained in the report of the latter. In that way, he could\nhave elicited some of the information contained in the reports of\nnontestifying experts. We conclude there was no error, and defendant\nwas accorded the rights he was due.\n\n   II. Trial Court’s Conduct in the Cross-Examination of Killian\n    Defendant next contends that the trial court deprived him of due\nprocess by acting “as an advocate for the State, where the trial judge\nassisted the prosecutor in cross-examining a defense expert and\nestablishing a foundation for admission of an exhibit that was highly\nprejudicial to the defense.” For purposes of clarity, we note that\ndefendant’s argument of error is confined to the trial court’s conduct\nin the sentencing examination of Dr. Killian. Defendant does not\notherwise argue that the evidence in question was improperly elicited\nand placed before the jury. In fact, his argument appears to concede\nthat there was an adequate foundation for the introduction of the\nevidence.\n    The evidence elicited consisted of certain questions posed to\ndefendant by Dr. Opsahl as part of the sentence-completion test, and\ndefendant’s answers to those questions. During the prosecutor’s\ncross-examination of Dr. Killian, Killian admitted that he had\n“reviewed” the sentence-completion test when forming his opinion.\nWhen the prosecutor handed Killian the sentence-completion test,\nand asked if that was the test he had reviewed, defense counsel\nobjected, arguing that the test was not relevant unless Killian had\nrelied upon the test in formulating his opinion. The prosecutor was\nthen allowed to question Killian as to whether he had relied upon the\nreport. Killian responded to the prosecutor’s question by first\nacknowledging that he had “looked at” the test, but had “not included\na description” of it in his own report. When the prosecutor again\nasked if Killian had relied on the test in his assessment of defendant,\nKillian said, equivocally, he did not “think” he did. Pressing for an\nunequivocal answer, the prosecutor again asked if some of the\nanswers on the test had helped Killian formulate his opinion. Killian\nthen answered that he could not “specifically recall,” but offered to\nexamine the test again. After he had done so, Killian stated that the\ndefendant’s test answers were “consistent with” what Killian “already\nbelieved about him from everything else [Killian] had read.” When\n\n                                 -65-\n\fthe prosecutor asked Killian to specify, defense counsel objected and\nasked to approach the bench. The trial court responded by\nannouncing a brief recess and, outside the jury’s presence, observed\nthat the witness was “not being responsive.” The court noted that\nKillian had stated he had not included the test in his report, but had\nnot unequivocally stated whether he had disregarded the test or relied\nupon it. He had essentially “skirted the issue.” The court concluded:\n“I think we need a vigorous interrogation on foundation by the State\nto see where this witness goes because he’s going in both directions.”\nIt is unclear from the transcript whether Killian was present when the\ncourt’s remarks were made; however, it is obvious that the remarks\nwere not directed to him personally.\n     When questioning resumed, out of the presence of the jury,\nKillian conceded that he had taken into account all of the materials\nplaced before him, and then qualified his answer by adding, “[I]t’s\nnot accurate to say that each piece of paper received the same amount\nof attention as any other piece of paper.” When the prosecutor asked\nif defendant’s test answers were important in Killian’s analysis,\nKillian stated: “I’m answering this as well as I can.”\n     The court then admonished Killian to answer the question asked,\nif he understood it, and, if he did not understand the question, to\nsimply say so. When the court had the question read back, Killian\nappeared to better understand the question, and answered that he\nconsidered defendant’s answers to the sentence-completion test\n“somewhat important.” When the prosecutor returned to the critical\nquestion he had posed at the outset, asking Killian whether he taken\ndefendant’s answers into account in arriving at his conclusion, Killian\nresponded with the same unresponsive answer that had initiated the\nexchange: “Not specifically, I did not include them in my report.” As\nthe prosecutor began to protest, the court again interceded, stating:\n         “Sir, there was a question asked you and you answered a\n         different question. *** I want you to listen to the question\n         asked of you and then I want you to answer that question\n         unless you don’t understand it. Do we understand each\n         other?”\nKillian responded affirmatively. When the question was read back,\nhe finally answered, unequivocally, that he took defendant’s answers\ninto account when forming his own opinion. With that, the court\ndetermined that a sufficient foundation existed to go into the\nsentence-completion test before the jury. Before the jury was called\n\n                                 -66-\n\fback into the courtroom, the court asked defense counsel if there was\nanything he wanted to contest in terms of that ruling, and counsel\nresponded, “It’s proper, I agree. He took it into account; so, it’s fair\ngame.” The prosecutor then proceeded to question the witness about\nthe sentence-completion test, questioning which–as we have\nobserved–defendant does not otherwise challenge.\n     We note that a trial judge has the discretion, when necessary, to\nadmonish a witness to answer questions directly and responsively.\nPeople v. Arnold, 2 Ill. 2d 92, 97 (1954); see People v. Gonzalez, 238\nIll. App. 3d 303, 320 (1992). In our view, the trial court properly\nexercised its discretion in this case, admonishing a witness who was\nbeing evasive. Similar admonitory remarks, even when made in front\nof a jury, have been found appropriate and not prejudicial. See\nPeople v. Kukulski, 358 Ill. 601, 608-09 (1934) (repeatedly advising\nthe witness to listen and answer the question); People v. Williams,\n201 Ill. App. 3d 207, 221 (1990) (defendant complained that the court\nhad admonished the defense expert by saying, “Doctor, would you do\nme a favor? Answer the question yes or no, don’t ramble.” “The\nwitness has a tendency to ramble. These are yes or no questions and\na date is a date”); People v. Osborne, 78 Ill. App. 2d 132, 139 (1966)\n(“Mr. Jones, the question is simple. The court believes the witness is\nbeing evasive about answering it”).\n     We find that the court in this case did not act in the capacity of an\nadvocate, as defendant suggests. Rather, the court sought to ensure\nthe State’s right to responsive answers from an evasive witness.\n\n       III. Comments Regarding Defendant’s Insanity Defense\n     Defendant next contends he was “denied due process and\nfundamental fairness where the trial judge informed the sentencing\njury that he had rejected the defendant’s insanity defense at trial, and\nwhere the prosecutor reminded the sentencing jury in closing\nargument that the trial judge had rejected the insanity defense.”\nAccording to defendant, those statements “improperly demeaned\n[his] mitigating evidence of mental illness, and punished [him] for\nexercising his constitutional right to present a defense.”\n     The State points out, inter alia, that defense counsel asked the\ntrial court to explain to the jurors why insanity was no longer an issue\nin the case, and attorney Elmore and the court advised the prosecutor\nthat he could clarify the status of insanity as an issue in closing\n\n\n                                  -67-\n\fargument. Thus, the State contends, if there was error, the defense\ninvited the court and prosecutor to commit it. We would agree;\nhowever, we conclude there was no error.\n     When the initial eight jurors were selected, they were told that\ndefendant had asserted the defense of insanity and they were\nquestioned about their ability to find defendant not guilty by reason\nof insanity if the defendant established that defense by a\npreponderance of the evidence. When the defendant subsequently\nchose to have the trial court consider and decide whether he was\nlegally insane at the time of the offense, that issue was removed from\nthe jury’s consideration, and some explanation became necessary.\nRecognizing that need, attorney Skelton asked the trial judge to “give\nthought to a potential admonition” to the jurors. Skelton explained:\n        “I think in fairness to the State as well as the defense, the\n        Court needs to advise them *** not that they were selected\n        under *** a now nonexistent theory, but something to lighten\n        the blow for both *** of us. *** And there might be some\n        fallout. I think the likely destination for that fallout is on the\n        defense. But I would like the Court to give some thought to\n        a potential admonition to the jury to straighten them out.”\nPursuant to that request, the court later submitted its proposed\nremarks to counsel for the defense and the State. Both defense\nattorneys indicated they had they had no problem with the content of\nthe court’s proposed explanation. The court then read those remarks\nto the jurors, explaining why they would not be participating in the\nfirst two stages of the tripartite capital procedure, and advising them\nof the findings the court had made in the first two phases. In the\ncourse of the court’s explanation, the judge told jurors he had rejected\ndefendant’s defense of insanity, and thrice read the jurors the\nstatutory definition of insanity. He did not mention the rejection of\ndefendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill, and he did not in any way\nsuggest that defendant’s mental condition was irrelevant to the jury’s\nsentencing decision.\n     Moreover, as previously noted, defense counsel’s opening\nstatement to the jurors made clear that they could still consider\nwhether defendant “suffer[ed] from any mental illness or mental\ndisease or mental defects” that affected his behavior. In their closing\narguments during the sentencing phase, the parties both\nacknowledged that “insanity” was no longer an issue; however, the\nexistence and consequences of defendant’s alleged mental or\n\n                                  -68-\n\fpersonality disorders were nonetheless the subject of extensive\ncomment. Indeed, after each of two instances when the prosecutor\nreminded the jury that insanity was no longer an issue, he eventually\naddressed statutory mitigating factors pertaining to defendant’s\nmental condition. His argument made clear that defendant’s mental\ncondition was a viable sentencing issue, but he felt that defendant\nshould receive a death sentence notwithstanding. Finally, the trial\ncourt’s instructions to the jury also underscored the relevance of\ndefendant’s mental condition in the sentencing decision. Under the\ncircumstances, we conclude that the comments of the court and the\nprosecutor were proper, and no error occurred.\n\n                  IV. Other Prosecutorial Comments\n    Defendant contends that other comments of the prosecutor were\nimproper and denied him a fair sentencing hearing. Specifically,\ndefendant argues that the prosecutor acted improperly when he (1)\n“emphasized that the jurors had taken an oath and promised to follow\nthe law, and then argued that the evidence in aggravation required\nthem under oath to impose a death sentence”; (2) invoked the\nintegrity of his office as a justification for seeking the death penalty;\nand (3) inflamed the passions of the jurors by referring to the families\nof the victims left behind and speculating about “how many children\nand grandchildren will not be born because of the actions of the\ndefendant.”\n    Defendant’s first claim of error is based upon two remarks of the\nprosecutor that appear 90 pages apart in the record of proceedings. In\nthe early portion of his closing argument, the prosecutor told the\njurors:\n            “[Y]ou were all selected to serve in this serious case\n        based on those promises that you made to the attorneys\n        during jury selection. Now on behalf of the People of the\n        State of Illinois and the People of the County of Livingston,\n        I’m asking you to keep those promises that you made under\n        oath several weeks ago.”\nMuch later, the prosecutor stated:\n            “Is he really worthy of your mercy? Ask yourselves with\n        all he did, is he really worthy of your mercy? I hate to admit\n        it, but we’ve really become a nation of excuse makers.\n        There’s always an excuse. Nothing is ever our fault. There\n\n                                  -69-\n\f        must be something in this person’s past that made him do\n        things. Well, we can’t take responsibility.\n            Allowing Andrew Urdiales to receive a natural life\n        sentence rather than the death penalty diminishes the\n        importance of Cassie Corum’s life and doesn’t serve the ends\n        of justice.”\nDefendant actually argues that these two passages are related and that\nthe jurors would have so perceived them: “Collectively, these\ncomments lectured the jury that imposing any penalty short of a death\nsentence would be irresponsible, and would constitute a violation of\nthe jury’s oath.”\n    Obviously, the prosecutor never told the jurors that their oath\nrequired them to impose the death penalty. The construction\ndefendant places upon these remarks is simply preposterous. The\nquoted comments do not support defendant’s claim of error even\nwhen they are taken out of context and placed in artificial tandem for\nargumentative exposition. This allegation of error deserves no further\ncomment.\n    We also reject defendant’s contention that he was denied a fair\nsentencing hearing because the prosecutor, during closing argument,\nimproperly “invoked the integrity of his office as a justification for\nseeking the death penalty.” We note, initially, that defendant did not\nobject to the remarks in question; therefore, he has forfeited this\nissue. See People v. Franklin, 135 Ill. 2d 78, 111 (1990). As in\nFranklin, we find that the remarks did not constitute error in any\nevent.\n    Defendant cites the following remarks in support of his argument:\n            “The decision to seek a death penalty is not a decision\n        that is lightly made by any prosecutor. A lot of things go into\n        consideration as to whether or not a person such as myself\n        would decide to seek the death penalty. I think a lot of people\n        think that every time there’s a murder committed that a\n        prosecutor gets to decide whether or not he’s going to seek\n        the death penalty. That’s simply not true. The law of the State\n        of Illinois only provides for the death penalty under certain\n        circumstances; and when those certain circumstances exist, it\n        is only then that the prosecutor has the discretion to make the\n        decision of whether or not to seek the death penalty. Careful\n        consideration has to be given and justice must be done, and\n\n\n                                 -70-\n\f         careful consideration has been given in this case as to whether\n         or not to seek the death penalty. Now we’re seeking that\n         justice be done in this case.”\n     Although not referenced in defendant’s brief, the prosecutor made\nother pertinent comments thereafter, remarks that we believe have a\nbearing upon the disposition of this issue. For example, soon after he\nmade the foregoing statements, the prosecutor made clear to the\njurors that the decision to impose the death penalty was theirs, and\ntheirs alone:\n             “You’ve seen and heard all the evidence that’s going to be\n         introduced in this case, and now the decision is yours. It’s\n         your decision to decide whether or not this Defendant,\n         Andrew Urdiales, in this case if it’s appropriate to impose the\n         death penalty. That’s your decision.”\n     The prosecutor later spoke to the jurors about the procedures for\ndetermining whether defendant would receive a death sentence. He\ncorrectly informed them that they would consider factors in\naggravation and mitigation in arriving at the appropriate sentence,\nthat unanimity would be required for a death sentence, and that\ndefendant would be sentenced to life in prison, without the possibility\nof release, if they were unable to find unanimously that death was the\nappropriate sentence.\n     The prosecutor made clear that his role in the adversarial process,\nhis “job,” was to talk to the jury about aggravating evidence. He\nobserved: “My job is not to mitigate here. *** [Y]ou’ll hear\nmitigating evidence when the defense gets to argue. But at this point\nin time, I’m going to give you the reasons, the evidence that support\n[sic] the Defendant should receive the death penalty from you folks\nwhen you go in and deliberate.”\n     The prosecutor then discussed, at length, the aggravating\nevidence, and urged the jury find that death was the appropriate\nsentence. As he concluded the initial portion of his closing argument,\nthe prosecutor’s remarks again served to remind the jurors that he, as\nthe prosecutor, was part of an adversarial process: “I’m sure that Mr.\nSkelton will have the opportunity now to address you; and he’ll make\na detailed argument as to why these eight murders and rape don’t\njustify a verdict on you folks’ part in favor of the death penalty.”\n     Following defense counsel’s closing argument, wherein he\ndiscussed the evidence in mitigation, the prosecutor made an\n\n\n                                 -71-\n\fabbreviated rebuttal argument, and the jury was then instructed in the\napplicable law. It is in this context that we consider the defendant’s\nclaim of error.\n     As we observed in People v. Jamison, 197 Ill. 2d 135, 161 (2001),\nthis court has long recognized that the State’s Attorney is endowed\nwith the exclusive discretion to decide which of several charges shall\nbe brought, or whether to prosecute at all. A prosecutor’s discretion\nextends to the decision about whether or not the death penalty should\nbe sought. Jamison, 197 Ill. 2d at 162.\n     In this case, the prosecutor correctly explained to the jurors the\nprocedure for seeking the death penalty, and advised them of his role\nin the capital process, as well as theirs. He obviously believed it was\nappropriate to seek the death penalty, or he would not have done so.\nIn that respect, his comments did not tell the jurors anything they had\nnot already deduced. To suggest that those comments could have\nimproperly swayed the jury is, in our opinion, to discredit the\ncommon sense and intelligence of those who served on the jury. In\nhis argument, the prosecutor left no doubt that his role was that of an\nadvocate in an adversarial process, and he clearly and repeatedly\nadvised the jurors that the decision whether or not to impose the death\npenalty was theirs alone.\n     In that respect, the prosecutor’s argument was very different from\nthose found objectionable in other cases. For example, in People v.\nYates, 98 Ill. 2d 502, 536-38 (1983), the prosecutor, in effect, told the\njury that he would assume responsibility for imposition of the death\npenalty. As this court noted, the assistant State’s Attorney in that case\nalso suggested that his “previous experience was somehow relevant\nto whether [the] defendant should be sentenced to death.” Yates, 98\nIll. 2d at 539. This court ordered a new sentencing hearing,\nconcluding that both remarks were improper: the former, because it\n“obviously served to diminish the jury’s sense of responsibility and\nmitigate the serious consequences of its decision”; the latter, because\nit “served to inject an improper and irrelevant consideration into the\njury’s deliberations.” Yates, 98 Ill. 2d at 538-39. In this capital case,\nas in others, a principal concern in our review is that comments of the\nprosecutor in closing argument do not diminish the sentencing jury’s\nsense of responsibility. See People v. Flores, 153 Ill. 2d 264, 288\n(1992); People v. Franklin, 135 Ill. 2d 78, 111 (1990). A capital\nsentencing jury bears the sole responsibility for determining whether\na defendant is sentenced to death, and it may not be informed either\n\n                                  -72-\n\fdirectly or by implication that this responsibility is shared or rests\nelsewhere, either with the court (see Flores, 153 Ill. 2d at 288) or\nwith the prosecutor (see Yates, 98 Ill. 2d at 537-38).\n    In this case, the prosecutor advised the jury that it was his\ndecision to seek the death penalty, and it was for them to decide\nwhether to impose it. That is a correct statement of law and\nprocedure. His comments further made clear that he was not an\nimpartial arbiter on the question of whether the death penalty should\nbe imposed, but was in fact an advocate for a position in an\nadversarial process. Common sense would indicate that his opinion\nwas reflected in the discretionary actions he took–as is the case with\nany prosecutor. The comments in question did not undermine or\ndiminish the jury’s sense of responsibility. Considering the\ncomplained-of remarks in the context of the entire closing argument,\nwe find no error.\n    We finally consider defendant’s contention that the prosecutor\n“improperly inflamed the passions of the jury by referring to the\nfamilies the victims left behind and speculating about ‘how many\nchildren and grandchildren will not be born because of the actions of\nthe defendant.’ ” During closing argument to the sentencing jury, the\nprosecutor stated:\n        “J.A. is the only one to get away with her life. The others\n        weren’t so lucky. How many children and grandchildren will\n        not be born because of the actions of the defendant? Each of\n        these girls had a family. Each one of them had their lives in\n        front of them. Each one of them would have been able to\n        have kids probably I assume at some point in their lives.\n        Those were all taken away by the acts of this one man.”\n    In People v. Emerson, 189 Ill. 2d 436, 508-10 (2000), this court\nheld that similar remarks constituted an improper appeal to the\nemotions of the jurors. In Emerson, the prosecution argued:\n            “Her name was Delinda Byrd. Delinda Byrd, a victim in\n        this case. She had a life. She had hopes. She had dreams.\n        They were taken away from her by Dennis Emerson. They\n        were taken away from her only because he cared about\n        nothing. Nothing, but himself. The last moments of her life\n        were spent struggling for breath while 90 percent of her skin\n        was being burned. Imagine her terror. Imagine her fear. ***\n\n\n\n                                -73-\n\f             *** This is the defendant that did that to her, that turned\n         her into a corpse, who took away all her hopes and dreams\n         and took away all of what she could contribute to society and\n         to the community, and all of what she could contribute to\n         everyone that knew her and enriched their lives.” Emerson,\n         189 Ill. 2d at 508-09.\nAlthough we found the foregoing remarks improper, we nonetheless\nconcluded that the comments, “in and of themselves,” were not so\nprejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a fair sentencing hearing.\nEmerson, 189 Ill. 2d at 510. Similarly, in People v. Kokoraleis, 132\nIll. 2d 235, 285 (1989), the prosecutor commented on the victims’\nrights to get married, have a family, have children, and spend time\nwith their families. Though this court found that the prosecutor’s\nargument was improper, the court concluded that the remarks did not\naffect the overall fairness of the sentencing hearing. Kokoraleis, 132\nIll. 2d at 285.\n     We so find in this case. The jury heard the details of defendant’s\neight murders and the graphic testimony of his one surviving victim.\nThe prosecutor’s brief and isolated comments, while improper, were\nnot so prejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a fair sentencing\nhearing or change the outcome of the proceeding.\n\n              V. Instructions Pertaining to Mitigation\n    Defendant next contends that his “death sentence is\nfundamentally unjust because the sentencing jury was never\ninstructed that it could consider the defendant’s background of\nextreme emotional or physical abuse as a mitigating factor.” As\ndefendant points out, as part of the death penalty reforms enacted by\nthe General Assembly (see Pub. Act 93–605, eff. November 19,\n2003), a new provision was added to section 9–1(c) of the Criminal\nCode, specifically stating that a defendant’s background of “extreme\nemotional or physical abuse” shall be considered as a mitigating\nfactor. Although defendant’s brief does not acknowledge that this\nprovision was in effect at the time of his trial in May of 2004, it\nclearly was in effect as of November 19, 2003.\n    We note, initially, that defendant tendered an instruction\naddressing applicable mitigating factors, and that instruction was\ngiven by the trial court; however, the tendered instruction did not\ninclude the language which defendant now claims was erroneously\n\n\n                                 -74-\n\fomitted. It is well established, by case law and rule, that a defendant\nmay not raise on appeal the failure to give an instruction unless the\ndefendant tendered the instruction at trial. People v. Hopp, 209 Ill. 2d\n1, 7 (2004); People v. Casillas, 195 Ill. 2d 461, 473 (2000); People\nv. Alvine, 173 Ill. 2d 273, 286 (1996); 155 Ill. 2d R. 366(b)(2)(i). The\npertinent portion of the instruction tendered by defendant read as\nfollows:\n             “Mitigating factors include:\n             First: Any or all of the following if supported by the\n         evidence:\n             The murder was committed while the defendant was\n         under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional\n         disturbance, although not such as to constitute a defense to\n         the prosecution.\n             The defendant suffers from a reduced mental capacity.\n             Second: Any other reason supported by the evidence why\n         the defendant should not be sentenced to death.\n             Where there is evidence of a mitigating factor, the fact\n         that such mitigating factor is not a factor specifically listed in\n         these instructions does not preclude your consideration of the\n         evidence.”\nObviously, the language that forms the basis of defendant’s\ncontention of error was not included in the instruction tendered by\ndefense counsel–the instruction the trial court ultimately gave. The\nissue was not raised in a posttrial motion. Defendant does not claim\nthat trial counsel was ineffective insofar as he tendered an instruction\nthat did not include the language in question. The defendant does not\nargue plain error.\n    Rather, defendant repeatedly refers to subsection (c)(6) of section\n9–1 as “recently enacted” and “new,” suggesting that he erroneously\nbelieves the statutory provision was not in effect at the time of his\nsentencing hearing. This inference is supported by a concluding\nsentence in his original brief: “That future defendants will have that\nbenefit, while Andrew Urdiales did not, is ‘fundamentally unjust.’ ”\n    Subsection (c)(6) was available to defendant; however, trial\ncounsel did not utilize it in their tendered instruction. Defendant does\nnot claim that they were ineffective in that respect; nor does he\nexplain why he believes the statutory provision was not available to\n\n\n                                   -75-\n\fcounsel. In short, defendant does not address his procedural default\nin any way. Thus, defendant has forfeited the issue.\n     Although defendant does not cite Supreme Court Rule 451(c)\n(177 Ill. 2d R. 451(c)), we note that rule’s “exception to the waiver\nrule for substantial defects applies when there is a grave error or\nwhen the case is so factually close that fundamental fairness requires\nthat the jury be properly instructed.” Hopp, 209 Ill. 2d at 7. Neither\nfactor is a consideration in this case.\n     The instruction the jury received was adequate to encompass\nconsideration of the evidence in question. In addition to specific\ninstructions bearing upon defendant’s mental state, the jury was\ninstructed that it could consider, in mitigation, “[a]ny other reason\nsupported by the evidence why the defendant should not be sentenced\nto death.” Continuing, the instruction informed the jury: “Where\nthere is evidence of a mitigating factor, the fact that such mitigating\nfactor is not a factor specifically listed in these instructions does not\npreclude your consideration of the evidence.”\n     In People v. Kirchner, 194 Ill. 2d 502 (2000), this court\nconsidered the efficacy of an identical catch-all instruction. In that\ncase, defendant claimed he was improperly denied a specific\ninstruction pertaining to the likelihood of his rehabilitation.\nDefendant claimed reversible error because the trial court refused to\ninstruct the jury that mitigating factors include that “[t]he defendant\nmay be rehabilitated or restored to useful citizenship.” Kirchner, 194\nIll. 2d at 554-55. In Kirchner, this court determined that a new\nsentencing hearing was not necessary, holding that the catch-all\ninstruction was adequate, under the facts of that case, to apprise the\njury that it could consider defendant’s potential for rehabilitation.\nKirchner, 194 Ill. 2d at 556-57.\n     In this case, Kendra Moses, defendant’s mitigation expert,\ntestified at length about the hardships and abuses defendant suffered\nin his formative years. Moreover, the jury heard extensive evidence\nregarding defendant’s mental condition–be it a mental illness or\npersonality disorder–and the origins of that condition. At least three\nof the testifying experts, including the State’s expert, believed that\ndefendant’s childhood experiences of abuse and/or neglect were\ncontributing factors in the formation of his current mental makeup,\na conclusion that few laymen would find surprising. That testimony\nwas inextricably tied to defendant’s argument that his mental\ncondition militated against the imposition of the death penalty. We\n\n                                  -76-\n\fhave no doubt that the jury considered defendant’s formative\nexperiences–particularly his mother’s temporary withdrawal, his\nsexual experience with his sister, and childhood teasing and\nbullying–and, correlatively, his mental condition, and appropriately\nweighed them against the details of eight brutal murders and the\nterrorism of J.A.\n    We have thoroughly reviewed the evidence in this case.\nAssuming, arguendo, that the abuse defendant suffered would qualify\nas “extreme,” we are confident that the jury’s verdict would not have\nbeen otherwise had the instruction been given with the proposed\nlanguage. See Kirchner, 194 Ill. 2d at 557, quoting Alvine, 173 Ill. 2d\nat 290 (“An error in a jury instruction is harmless if the result of the\ntrial would not have been different if a proper instruction had been\ngiven”).\n\n                            Apprendi Issue\n    Finally, defendant argues that the Illinois death penalty statute\nviolates principles announced in Apprendi in that it does not require\napplication of the reasonable doubt standard at the second stage of\ncapital sentencing proceedings. We have addressed and rejected that\nargument in People v. Thompson, 222 Ill. 2d 1, 52-54 (2006), People\nv. Mertz, 218 Ill. 2d 1, 93-94 (2005), and People v. Ballard, 206 Ill.\n2d 151, 202-05 (2002). Defendant raises no new arguments in this\nrespect, and we decline to revisit the issue.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n    We find in defendant’s arguments no basis for reversal or\nremand. Although defendant has not specifically argued that the\nevidence is insufficient to support his death sentence, it is our\nresponsibility in every death penalty case to consider the\nappropriateness of the sentence. People v. Heard, 187 Ill. 2d 36, 85\n(1999). After careful consideration of the evidence adduced, we\nconcur in the jury’s determination that death is the appropriate\npenalty. Pursuant to section 9–1(i) of the Criminal Code (720 ILCS\n5/9–1(i) (West 2004)), we find no fundamental injustice in this case.\nFor the reasons stated herein, we affirm the defendant’s conviction\nand death sentence. We direct the clerk of this court to enter an order\nsetting Tuesday, May 8, 2007, as the date on which the sentence of\ndeath shall be carried out. Defendant shall be executed in the manner\n\n                                 -77-\n\fprovided by law. 725 ILCS 5/119–5 (West 2004). The clerk of this\ncourt shall send a certified copy of the mandate in this case to the\nDirector of Corrections, the warden of Tamms Correctional Center,\nand the warden of the institution where defendant is confined.\n\n                                                               Affirmed.\n\n    JUSTICE KILBRIDE, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n    I agree with the majority’s analysis of virtually all the issues\npresented in this case, including its examination of the questions\nimpacting on the guilt phase of defendant’s trial. I part company only\nwith the majority’s view that during the sentencing phase the jury\nneed not be specifically instructed on the mitigating effect of a\ndefendant’s history of abuse, as expressly required by subsection\n(c)(6) of section 9–1 (720 ILCS 5/9–1(c)(6) (West 2004)). Slip op. at\n76.\n    Subsection (c)(6) is one of a parcel of statutory protections\nenacted following the spate of seriously flawed capital cases that\nprompted the current moratorium on executions in this state. This\nsubsection states:\n            “The court shall consider, or shall instruct the jury to\n        consider any aggravating and any mitigating factors which\n        are relevant to the imposition of the death penalty. ***\n        Mitigating factors may include but need not be limited to the\n        following:\n                                  ***\n                (6) the defendant’s background includes a history of\n            extreme emotional or physical abuse[.]” (Emphases\n            added.) 720 ILCS 5/9–1(c)(6) (West 2004).\n    After noting that this subsection was in effect at the time of\ndefendant’s trial, the majority concludes that he has forfeited this\nclaim. Slip op. at 76. Ordinarily, I would agree that it is unnecessary\nto conduct a new sentencing hearing solely due to the omission of a\nspecific mitigating factor as long as a catchall instruction is included\ninforming the jury that the failure to list a particular mitigating factor\n“ ‘does not preclude [the jury’s] consideration of the evidence’ ” (slip\nop. at 76). See Kirchner, 194 Ill. 2d at 556-57. In this instance,\nhowever, I am otherwise persuaded by the historical underpinnings\n\n\n                                  -78-\n\fof the statutory changes at issue. The legislature enacted those\nchanges to reform our seriously flawed capital punishment system.\nThe legislature’s efforts, combined with those of this court (see 188\nIll. 2d Rs. 43, 411, 412(c), 416, 417, 701(b), 714), have effectuated\nfundamental changes in capital proceedings with the laudable goal of\nreducing the number of erroneous capital convictions and sentences\nentered in this state.\n     With that goal in mind, the legislature added subsection (c)(6),\nrequiring a jury instruction specifically pointing out the need for\njurors to consider a defendant’s background as a victim of abuse. 720\nILCS 5/9–1(c)(6) (West 2004). The statutory language mandates that\nthe court “shall” instruct the jury on the listed mitigating factors,\nincluding a history of abuse noted in subsection (c)(6). The plain\nlanguage added to redress Illinois’ troubled capital punishment\nsystem demonstrates the legislature’s clear intent to differentiate this\nfactor from the myriad of possible mitigation sources encompassed\nby the catchall instruction relied on by the majority. Slip op. at 76.\nThus, where, as here, there was evidence that defendant had\nundergone emotional and physical abuse as a child, the statute\nobliged the trial court to instruct the jury on this mitigating factor.\nReliance on a catchall instruction does not adhere to the will of the\nlegislature or uphold the spirit of the amendments.\n     Furthermore, the legislature added another statutory protection to\novercome the fundamental defects in our prior capital punishment\nsystem. That provision grants this court the authority to vacate a\nparticular death sentence and impose a term of years if that sentence\nis “fundamentally unjust” (720 ILCS 5/9–1(i) (West 2004)). Here, it\nis fundamentally unjust to ignore the legislature’s clear mandate that\njuries must be specifically apprised of the relevance of mitigating\nabuse evidence. Our legislature’s capital punishment reforms merit\nthe highest degree of judicial adherence because they are designed to\nrectify the serious problems in our prior system.\n     In addition, all the mental-health witnesses in this case agreed\nthat defendant suffered from some type of mental disorder, including\npossible organic brain disease, although they could not agree on a\nsingle diagnosis. Slip op. at 14-18. To submit to a jury the question\nof whether to impose the death penalty on defendant without strict\nadherence to the safeguards imposed by both this court and our\nlegislature flies in the face of fundamental justice and undermines\nthese fundamental reform efforts. The absence of the mitigating-\n\n                                 -79-\n\ffactor instruction in subsection (c)(6) unjustly contravenes the clear\nintent of our legislature and leaves the jury to resolve the life-and-\ndeath issue of imposing the death penalty without the specific\nguidance of a mitigating factor the legislature has deemed sufficiently\ncritical to single out for express consideration. Here, the evidence of\nabuse was relegated to the broad, undefined category of nonspecific\npotential mitigation material, failing to give it the distinct recognition\nintended by the legislature.\n     Given the immense gravity of the issues in capital proceedings,\nI believe both fundamental justice and the reliability of this state’s\ncapital punishment system require our courts to apply all legislative\nand judicial reform measures unwaveringly. If we do not, we risk a\nrecurrence of the tragic circumstances that prompted those reforms.\nThus, although I abhor the heinous crimes committed by this\ndefendant, I cannot countenance any erosion of our revised system of\ncapital punishment caused by lax enforcement of the newly minted\nsafeguards. Because the jury was not properly instructed in this case,\nI would remand this cause for a new sentencing hearing incorporating\nan instruction specifically noting the mitigating effect of emotional\nor physical abuse inflicted on defendant. For these reasons, I\nrespectfully dissent from the majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -80-\n\f",

The State subsequently filed\nnotice of intent to seek the death penalty. Defendant tendered a plea\nof guilty but mentally ill; however, the State disputed the existence\nof mental illness. The parties subsequently agreed to an evidentiary\nhearing in which the trial court simultaneously received evidence\nconcerning the factual basis for the plea and conducted a bench trial\non the issue of guilt/innocence. The trial court ultimately rejected\n\fdefendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill and his bench trial defense\nof insanity. The court found defendant guilty of first degree murder.\nDefendant waived a jury for the eligibility stage of capital sentencing,\nand the circuit court subsequently found defendant eligible for the\ndeath penalty based upon prior murder convictions. See 720 ILCS\n5/9–1(b)(3) (West 2004). Defendant elected jury consideration for the\naggravation/mitigation phase of sentencing. After considering\nevidence in aggravation and mitigation, the jury concluded that death\nwas the appropriate sentence. See 720 ILCS 5/9–1(g) (West 2004).\nThe circuit court thereafter sentenced defendant to death. Because\ndefendant was sentenced to death, his appeal was brought directly to\nthis court. Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, §4(b); 134 Ill. 2d R. 603.\n     On appeal, defendant contends that (1) the trial court erred in\nordering defendant restrained during trial, and instructing the jury\nthat “security measures” had been implemented; (2) the trial court’s\nrepeated on-the-record criticisms of recent appellate court opinions\ndeprived defendant of due process and fundamental fairness; (3) the\ntrial court denied defendant due process and fundamental fairness\nwhen the court disparaged the motives and conduct of attorneys from\nthe Office of the State Appellate Defender; (4) the trial court abused\nits discretion in rejecting defendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill;\n(5) the trial court’s verdict of guilty, instead of guilty but mentally ill,\nwas against the manifest weight of the evidence; (6) the trial court’s\nstatement to the sentencing jury, that the court had rejected\ndefendant’s insanity defense at trial, and the prosecutor’s reference\nthereto in closing argument, “improperly demeaned the defendant’s\nmitigating evidence of mental illness, and punished defendant for\nexercising his constitutional right to present a defense”; (7) the trial\ncourt erred in denying defendant’s request to submit experts’ reports\nto the jury; (8) the trial court erred in improperly assisting the\nprosecutor in cross-examining a witness and thus establishing a\nfoundation for a prosecution exhibit; (9) the prosecutor’s closing\nargument denied defendant due process; (10) the sentencing jury\nshould have been specifically instructed that a background of extreme\nemotional or physical abuse is a mitigating factor; and (11) the\nIllinois death penalty statute violates principles announced in\nApprendi in that it does not require application of the reasonable\ndoubt standard at the second stage of capital sentencing proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fWe set forth, hereafter, a summary of the evidence pertinent to a\ndiscussion of the issues raised by defendant.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n    On July 14, 1996, police found the nude body of an unidentified\nwoman floating in the Vermilion River in Livingston County. The\nwoman’s wrists had been handcuffed, her ankles were bound with\nduct tape, and her mouth was covered with duct tape. An autopsy\nrevealed that the victim had died of a single gunshot wound to the\nhead and seven stab wounds to the head and chest. The body was\nlater identified as that of Cassandra Corum. Corum had been reported\nmissing from Hammond, Indiana.\n    Corum’s murder was subsequently linked to the murders of two\nyoung women in Cook County. The bodies of Laura Uylaki and Lynn\nHuber had been found in Wolf Lake, a body of water in Cook\nCounty, near the Indiana border. Each of those victims had also been\nshot in the head and stabbed multiple times. Ballistics tests indicated\nthat all three victims were killed by bullets fired from the same gun.\n    On April 1, 1997, a police officer in Hammond, Indiana,\nresponded to a call involving defendant and a prostitute. The\nprostitute told the officer that defendant had wanted to take her to\nWolf Lake, handcuff and duct tape her, and have sex with her. In\nNovember of 1996, the same officer had arrested defendant for\nunlawful possession of a firearm, and at that time had found rolls of\nduct tape in defendant’s truck. The Hammond police officer\nforwarded the information he had obtained to Chicago detectives,\nwho subsequently obtained the gun seized from defendant as a result\nof his November 1996 arrest. Testing revealed that defendant’s gun\nhad fired the bullets that killed Cassandra Corum, Laura Uylaki, and\nLynn Huber.\n    On April 22, 1997, Chicago police officers approached defendant,\nwho voluntarily agreed to talk with them. At the police station,\ndetectives showed defendant photographs of Corum, Uylaki, and\nHuber, but defendant claimed he did not recognize them. During the\nquestioning, defendant indicated he had bought his handgun\napproximately four or five years earlier from a gunshop in Calumet\nCity, and it had been under his exclusive control until it was\nconfiscated in Hammond, Indiana. When officers told defendant the\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthree women had been killed by bullets fired from his gun, defendant\npaused for a minute, took off his security guard badge, started taking\noff his shoelaces, and said, “Well, I guess I’m not going to work\ntoday.” Defendant then provided the police with detailed confessions\nto all three Illinois murders. Without prompting from the police,\ndefendant also mentioned “some matters” that California authorities\n“might be interested in.” Defendant subsequently confessed to the\nmurders of Robbin Brandley, Julie McGhee, Mary Ann Wells,\nTammy Erwin, and Denise Maney, as well as the kidnapping, rape,\nand attempted murder of J.A., all of which were committed in\nCalifornia between 1986 and 1995.\n     The details of those offenses were provided in testimony and\nevidence presented at the aggravation/mitigation phase of sentencing,\nand will be recounted in our discussion of that portion of defendant’s\ntrial.\n     On March 10, 1998, a Livingston County grand jury returned a\nfour-count indictment charging defendant with first degree murder\nfor the killing of Cassandra Corum. In March of 2001, the State filed\nnotice of its intent to seek the death penalty, alleging three possible\neligibility factors: that the defendant had been convicted of\nmurdering two or more individuals (720 ILCS 5/9–1(b)(3) (West\n2000)), that he had killed Cassandra Corum during the course of an\naggravated kidnapping (720 ILCS 5/9–1(b)(6) (West 2000)), and that\nthe murder was committed in a cold, calculated, premeditated manner\npursuant to a preconceived plan (720 ILCS 5/9–1(b)(11) (West\n2000)).\n     Defendant was convicted of the Cook County murders, and was\nsentenced to death on September 3, 2002. In that case, a jury rejected\nclaims that defendant was legally insane or mentally ill as defined in\nsection 6–2(d) of the Criminal Code of 1961. See 720 ILCS 5/6–2(d)\n(West 2002). On January 10, 2003, then-governor George Ryan\ncommuted defendant’s death sentence to one of natural life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole.\n     On November 3, 2003, defendant’s appointed counsel in this\ncase, Steven Skelton and James Elmore, requested that the trial judge\naccept the appearance of attorney Stephen Richards as additional\ncounsel for defendant. Richards was a deputy defender with one of\nthe State Appellate Defender’s Death Penalty Trial Assistance offices\n(hereafter DPTA). The trial judge allowed Richards to enter his\n\n                                 -4-\n\fappearance with the understanding that Skelton and Elmore would be\n“lead counsel” and that the court would look to them for management\nof the case.\n     Richards subsequently tendered a written entry of appearance\nduring a hearing conducted on December 1, 2003. On that document,\nJohn Hanlon and Allan Sincox, staff attorneys of DPTA, were also\nlisted as entering their appearance. The trial judge did not\nimmediately notice the unauthorized addition of Hanlon and Sincox,\na matter that came to the court’s attention when the judge observed\nwhat he perceived as disruptive behavior in the courtroom:\n            “THE COURT: Who is the gentleman behind Mr.\n        Richards, because I am getting tired of the expressions on his\n        face and his gyrations. *** And now he is quite red-faced and\n        he seems very angry.\n            Sir, who are you?\n            MR. SINCOX: My name is Allan Sincox. My appearance\n        is now on file. Mr. Richards filed an appearance with my\n        name listed on it today. I have been assisting with this case.\n            THE COURT: You are not an attorney in this case, sir.\n        You are not now an attorney in this case.\n            Oh, I see the appearance has–well, I gave permission, Mr.\n        Richards, for you to assist Mr. Elmore and Mr. Skelton at this\n        relatively late date. I have not given permission for John\n        Hanlon, Allan Sincox to do so. I have not heard from Mr.\n        Elmore and Mr. Skelton that they want their assistance. So\n        the way the record stands now, and I do thank you for calling\n        that to my attention[,] Mr. Richards has been requested for\n        assistance in this case by Mr. Skelton and Mr. Elmore. I have\n        not heard from them as to John Hanlon or Allan Sincox. I am\n        concerned about you, you are Mr. Sincox?\n            MR. SINCOX: Yes, I am, Judge.\n            THE COURT: I am concerned about your professional\n        demeanor here in court today. On four or five occasions you\n        have gripped your head and shaken your head. And it is\n        quite–it is at least distracting to me ***.\n            MR. SINCOX: Well, that is my fault. And I do apologize.\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f             THE COURT: Your apology is accepted. I didn’t know\n        you were an attorney. Quite frankly, I am shocked.”\nAttorney Sincox then noted that he had been involved in the trial of\ndefendant’s cases in Cook County, and he explained: “[T]here are\nthings I find myself wanting to tell the lawyers.” The court\nresponded, “I understand the emotional factor, but you are an\nattorney, and you should know better.” The court then clarified the\nstatus of defendant’s representation, noting that “Mr. Richards is in\nthe case; Mr. Hanlon and Mr. Sincox are not.” The record indicates\nthat the names of Hanlon and Sincox were, at some point, stricken\nfrom the entry of appearance.\n     At a subsequent hearing on December 23, 2003, Richards was\nallowed to argue various pretrial motions for the defense, without\ncomment or objection from the trial judge. The trial court reserved\nruling on two of those motions, and denied the remainder.\n     Later, on February 6, 2004, during a pretrial hearing attended\nonly by the prosecutors and attorneys Skelton and Elmore, Skelton\nbroached the possibility that he might ask the court to allow attorney\nSincox to “enter his appearance for the limited purpose of deposing\nDr. [Park] Dietz in California.” The trial judge asked counsel, “Is this\nall going to get accomplished in time not to impact on the trial date?”\nCounsel for defendant nodded affirmatively. The court then\nexpressed “concern” about Sincox’s involvement in the case, noting\nthat he had acted “very unlawyer-like the only time that he was here”\nand that he had conducted himself “in a very unprofessional manner.”\nAt that point, the prosecutor questioned why Sincox had to be\ninvolved and why Skelton and Elmore could not conduct the\ndeposition.\n     Without further comment on the prosecutor’s statement, the trial\njudge commended attorneys Skelton and Elmore for the job they had\ndone to that point, and then stated his belief that attorneys Sincox and\nRichards had “an agenda far greater than” the defendant’s case. He\nindicated he wanted to ensure that Elmore and Skelton remained in\ncontrol of the case and exercised their “independent judgment.”\nContinuing, the trial court stated:\n             “I can see a deposition out there going into several areas,\n        well, now they are objecting, and now I am supposed to rule\n        on objections taking place out in California. I don’t trust Mr.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f         Sincox. *** His conduct in this courtroom was most\n         unprofessional. It is clear to me that he has an agenda far\n         greater than Mr. Urdiales and he is motivated by that. And I\n         am concerned that his conduct will be governed by that. ***\n         And if he goes far afield out there, we have got a mess on our\n         hands in terms of, well, now the deposition wasn’t completed.\n         Now we are going to certify some questions and get those\n         back to this court. And we are moving great amounts of cases\n         away from this calendar of mine in Livingston County. I got\n         a heavy calendar and we are making lots of room and going\n         through all kinds of exercises here to get this case tried in\n         April. And I want to get it tried in April.”\n     The trial judge observed: “It is premature to rule on this motion.\nIt’s not yet filed. If you do file it, you need to make plans. I have no\nproblem hearing this motion by conference call ***.” The court then\nmoved on, questioning the prosecutors as to whether the reports of\ncertain experts would be timely filed and were “on track.”\n     The record indicates that a motion was later filed requesting that\nSincox be allowed to enter a limited appearance to take the\ndeposition of Dr. Dietz. On March 4, 2004, in one of many pretrial\nconferences, the court addressed that motion:\n             “THE COURT: There was a motion here with respect to\n         Mr. Sincox. I am finding that motion rendered moot because\n         Mr. Elmore is going to go [to California] and Mr. Sincox is\n         not now a member of the defense team. I indicated some\n         reluctance to increase the defense team at this point and bring\n         in somebody new. And that issue simply goes away if Mr.\n         Elmore is going to go to California if necessary.”\n             MR. ELMORE: Yes, I think both Mr. Skelton and myself\n         anticipate making a trip out there.”\nDefense counsel did not object to the court’s statement that the\nmotion was moot and did not take any action to obtain a ruling on the\nmotion.\n     Also prior to trial, the court addressed the matter of courtroom,\nsecurity. On April 19, 2004, just prior to jury selection, the court\nnoted for the record:\n         “[T]he defendant is seated there at table where his hands are\n         free. He is in street clothes. There is an eyebolt in the floor.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f        And there he has shackles on his legs. And that shackle is\n        attached to the eyebolt in the floor. The jury, I believe it is\n        correct, will not be able to see that shackling. They will be\n        unaware of it unless Mr. Urdiales makes some noise or some\n        motion that would call their attention to it. And I want to at\n        least see if there is any objection on the record.”\nDefense counsel stated that the judge’s remarks were “factual and\ncorrect,” that the defendant wanted the record to reflect that he was\nsecured in that fashion, and the defense had “no objection to it now.”\n    The trial court then discussed two recent appellate court cases\npertaining to courtroom security and restraint of defendants, noting\nthat he “respectfully disagree[d] with both [of] those decisions,” but\nhe had to “take them into account.” The trial judge also\nacknowledged this court’s decision in People v. Boose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2080012\"><a href=\"/opinion/2080012/people-v-boose/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1977). The judge suggested that appellate court justices might not\nappreciate how “trial circumstances have changed,” in part because\nsome of them have “never been trial judges” and have “never\npracticed criminal law.” The trial judge offered his observation that\n“[t]imes have simply changed,” and that he had seen “a great deal of\nviolence occurring in [the] courtroom,” noting the presence of two\nprisons within the county.\n    The court made clear that defendant had behaved appropriately\nup to that point. However, the judge observed that defendant had\nbeen recently convicted of two murders and, though his death\nsentence had been commuted, he was still serving two life sentences.\nThe court stated that was one factor in its decision to restrain\ndefendant. The court also noted that defendant was in good health\nand had no difficultly getting around; thus, suggesting that defendant\ncould pose a physical threat. Moreover, the court observed that the\nLivingston County courthouse was built in 1875 and there were “all\nkind of security problems” with the building and the courtroom. The\njudge pointed out that the courtroom was small and seating was close.\nHe stated that two guards would be seated in the row behind the\ndefendant. In that respect, the court observed:\n        “The jurors, I think, will understand that. And importantly for\n        a reviewing court, I have learned over the years that the jurors\n        aren’t stupid. And they will be told the defendant is in\n        custody and that certain security measures have been taken,\n        such as the guards being here. They would expect that. And\n\n                                  -8-\n\f         I believe they can handle that and still give both sides a fair\n         trial.”\nWith that, the trial court asked: “Is there anything else on that issue\nthat either the State or the defense wishes to bring up?” For the\ndefense, attorney Skelton responded, “No, sir.”\n     The court then recessed prior to the commencement of jury voir\ndire. During that recess, out of the presence of the trial judge and\npotential jurors, a disturbance occurred in the courtroom.\nSubsequently, without potential jurors present, the trial judge swore\nin one of the correctional officers guarding defendant in order to\nascertain what had happened. The officer, Craig Valleroy, testified\nthat defendant had turned to talk to a lady seated behind him. The\nofficers initially thought the woman was a lawyer, but when she\nindicated otherwise, they told defendant he could not speak with her.\nDefendant then became angry. Stating, “I don’t give a damn,” he\nslapped a cup of water on the table in front of him, sending it flying,\nand he “threw *** stuff around.” He was told to settle down, and was\nthen physically subdued and handcuffed.\n     After ascertaining what had happened, the trial judge asked\ndefendant, “Will you promise to behave yourself if I do not shackle\nyou.” Defendant did not respond to the court directly. Rather,\ndefendant had attorney Skelton note for the record that defendant had\nnot been shackled during proceedings in Cook County and there had\nbeen no outbursts or problems. Counsel stated: “And he is concerned\nabout his perception of the respect he is being shown here by both the\ncourt and security personnel in the courtroom.” Counsel\nacknowledged that he had attended defendant’s trial in Cook County\nand that the “logistics of that courtroom and the parameters of that\ncourtroom are somewhat different.”\n     In response to the concerns expressed by defendant, the trial\njudge observed that “the world changed” for defendant with his\nmurder convictions in Cook County, suggesting, had defendant been\nfound not guilty there, the court “would have been doing something\ndifferent here.” The court also pointed out, “you are on trial here for\nyour life.” As a result of the incident, the court ordered defendant’s\nleft hand shackled under the table as well. Though the court allowed\ndefendant’s right hand to remain free, the court ordered that\ndefendant be given no pencils or pens.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f    Two days later, in chambers, the trial judge, with defense counsel\nand counsel for the prosecution present, revisited the issue of\ncourtroom security and addressed the circumstances of defendant’s\nprior courtroom outburst. The court noted that jurors were not present\nwhen defendant “ went ballistic,” “went berserk, throwing water all\nover.” The court observed that “two very large guards were necessary\nto restrain him notwithstanding that he was already shackled by his\nfeet to an eye bolt on the floor.” The judge then asked attorney\nElmore whether he had overstated the incident with the use of the\nterms “ballistic” and “berserk.”\n    Elmore responded that the judge had not overstated the severity\nof the incident, and added that “there were actually three guards”\ninvolved. Elmore indicated that the guards had to take defendant to\nthe floor to subdue him and that defendant had knocked over the table\nwhere he was seated.\n    At that juncture, the trial judge criticized various justices of the\nappellate court for positions they had taken on the issue of shackling,\nstating that one of them had, in an appellate court opinion, “really\nroughed me up because I shackled some inmates.” The judge\nexpressed concern “that people with that frame of mind will speculate\nthat I contributed to the event on Monday because I had Mr. Urdiales\nshackled.” The court observed:\n         “First of all, the response of defendant to go berserk was an\n         overreaction on his part. If he didn’t like that, he should have\n         communicated to counsel. He should have said something in\n         court. We did not have a word of protest coming from him\n         prior to that. He simply went off.”\nThe court characterized defendant as a “high risk individual.” The\ntrial judge observed that there had been a change in defendant’s\ndemeanor after he was convicted of the murders in Cook County and\nsentenced to death. The court stated: “Mr. Urdiales I have concluded\nfears that judgment day is coming closer.” The judge noted “a\ndramatic change” at the prior pretrial hearing, when defendant\n“learned that this trial was actually going to go forward finally.” The\ncourt continued, “I saw without a doubt an emotion in his eyes that\nI had not seen before. *** I saw furtive movements on the part of Mr.\nUrdiales; and I see quite frankly, honestly a desperate man.” The trial\njudge then embarked upon yet another diatribe against what he saw\nas the appellate court’s unwarranted intrusion into the security\n\n                                  -10-\n\fconcerns of the circuit court, expressing his belief that the appellate\ncourt seemed “bent on causing trial judges trouble.” The judge\nindicated he would have a transcript of the proceedings sent to certain\nnamed justices of the appellate court.\n    Following that harangue, the judge again indicated that he did not\nbelieve the jury could see the shackling of defendant because of\nskirting around the table where defendant was seated. He asked\ndefense counsel: “[D]o you want me to free up Mr. Urdiales more\nthan I am contemplating doing?” In response, attorney Skelton asked\nonly that defendant be given a writing implement short enough that\nit would pose no danger to counsel or anyone else. The court then\nstated: “DOC has had in the past inch pencils. *** It’s a very small\npencil. We’ll explore that and come up with a writing material that\ncouldn’t do you harm.” Still addressing the security issue, Skelton\nthen stated:\n            “Half facetiously, the only thing I want to make sure of is\n        that Mr. Urdiales is seated on a very heavy chair. For the\n        record, I had an unfortunate experience about 14, 16 years\n        ago where an inmate from Pontiac Correctional Center\n        decided that a better place for a chair was on my head than on\n        the floor. I know what the court’s talking about. I’ve been\n        there.”\n    Elmore thereafter sought to clarify what had prompted the\ndefendant’s courtroom outburst, noting that defendant “became upset\nnot because he was shackled but because he could not communicate\nwith his parents and Kendra Moses.” Elmore explained that\ndefendant had originally told a Livingston County correctional officer\nthat Moses was an attorney, and Elmore subsequently told them\notherwise, noting that she was a “mitigator,” not an attorney.\nAccording to Elmore, defendant then turned and “glared at [Elmore]\nfor a second,” prompting Elmore to caution defendant, “Andrew,\nwe’re not going to do that now. She’s not an attorney.” Elmore said\na correctional officer then politely informed defendant that he could\nnot talk to Moses at that point in time. Elmore explained, “That’s\nwhat precipitated him becoming upset. It wasn’t even, in my mind,\n*** the fact he was shackled that’s what caused him to go off. Just to\nsupport your position further, it wasn’t the shackling I don’t think\nthat really upset him. It was the fact he couldn’t communicate with\nMoses, and he went off.”\n\n                                 -11-\n\f    A prosecutor interjected, “He was lucky he was shackled at that\npoint or he would have had much more free rein.” The same\nprosecutor added: “Mr. Elmore should tell you, but it’s up to him,\nthat he knows something with regard to a previous meeting in prison\nin a room with Mr. Urdiales that he later learned endangered his own\nself; but he’d have to tell you that. I bring it up. I guess he doesn’t\nwant to. It solidifies [the court’s] intuition, and I know about it from\nseveral months ago.” Although the judge indicated he would “ask the\ndetails,” the matter was apparently dropped as the court and parties\nmoved on to matters bearing upon jury selection.\n    Jury voir dire began on April 19, 2004. At the outset, the trial\njudge advised potential jurors:\n        “You may or may not notice that Mr. Urdiales is in custody.\n        And we have taken certain security measures because of that\n        simple fact. You would expect us to do that for anyone who’s\n        in custody. The fact that Mr. Urdiales is presently in custody\n        should not impact in any way whatsoever on the\n        determination of whether Mr. Urdiales is found guilty or not\n        guilty ***.”\nA total of eight jurors were selected for trial on the first day of\nselection. When jury selection resumed on the morning of April 22,\ndefense counsel advised the court in chambers that defendant,\n“without any urging,” had raised the possibility of entering an open\nplea of guilty to the murder charges against him. Attorney Skelton\nnoted: “If *** Mr. Urdiales determines that he wants to plead guilty\nwithout–and we are talking a straight guilty plea–not trying to\nstructure in a way of guilty but mentally ill plea, that would–and it is\nan understatement to say–substantially modify the manner in which\nwe would approach potential jurors, the remaining four, plus\nalternates in this case.”\n    The trial judge expressed concern over developments and stated\nthe obvious: that defendant should take such an action only after “full\ndeliberation.” The judge encouraged counsel to consult with\ndefendant further.\n    After another brief period of consultation with defendant,\nattorney Skelton reported that defendant was steadfast in his desire\nto plead guilty, however, it was likely that defendant would enter a\nplea of guilty but mentally ill. The defense contemplated “a waiver\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fof jury as to the first phase of the proceeding, plea of guilty, with the\ncourt determining the existence or lack of mental illness.” The\ndefendant would retain his right to a jury trial for the sentencing\nphase of the death penalty proceeding. A prosecutor advised the court\nand defense counsel that the State would dispute whether defendant\nwas in fact “mentally ill,” as that term is defined in the statute.\nAttorney Skelton, again speaking to procedure, reiterated that the\ncourt would decide whether defendant was mentally ill: “There\nwould be a bench trial as to the existence or lack of mental illness.\nThere would not be a trial before the Court as to the elements of the\noffense, that is that he killed Cassandra Corum.” Counsel advised the\ncourt that a jury would be needed for the “second and third” stages of\ndeath penalty proceedings, the eligibility and aggravation/mitigation\nphases.\n    After further discussion and consultation, it was decided that the\ncourt would admonish defendant the next morning and conduct a\nhearing on defendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill (GBMI);\nhowever, the court would reserve ruling until jury selection was\ncomplete. Then the court would take additional evidence on mental\nillness, and either accept the plea of guilty but mentally ill or proceed\nwith the jury trial.\n    On April 23, 2004, the defendant tendered his plea of guilty but\nmentally ill. The trial court admonished defendant thoroughly\nconcerning the nature of the charge, the possible penalties, the three\nseparate stages of a capital trial, and the variety of verdicts possible\nin the event the defendant retained his right to trial. The trial court\nexplained that, by pleading guilty but mentally ill, the defendant\nwould be giving up the defense of insanity, and a finding of guilty but\nmentally ill would not insulate him from a possible death sentence.\nThe defendant indicated he understood the admonitions. The judge\ndetermined that defendant had not been subject to threats or coercion,\nand that his plea of guilty but mentally ill was voluntary.\n    The trial judge indicated he would not decide whether to accept\nthe plea of guilty but mentally ill until there had been a full\nevidentiary hearing. The court explained the possible outcomes and\nramifications of that proceeding, and defendant again indicated he\nunderstood. Defendant then signed and tendered a plea of guilty but\nmentally ill, which specified that he retained his right to jury trial on\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fall issues if the plea was rejected, and his right to a jury for\nsentencing if the plea was accepted.\n    The State then presented an extensive factual basis for the murder\nof Cassandra Corum. Defendant did not dispute the factual basis\npresented, and the court concluded that there was a sufficient factual\nbasis “with respect to the murder elements themselves.” The court\nagain indicated that it would not accept the plea of guilty but\nmentally ill until there had been an evidentiary hearing on the issue\nof mental illness. Thereafter, jury selection resumed, with four\nadditional jurors, and six alternates, chosen over the next several\ndays.\n    After the completion of jury selection, defense counsel informed\nthe court that, in the event the court rejected the plea of guilty but\nmentally ill, the defendant was considering waiving a jury for the\nguilt/innocence phase and requesting a bench trial to preserve his\ninsanity defense. Noting that a jury had already been chosen and was\nwaiting to hear the case, the trial judge expressed some reluctance to\nallow the jury waiver, as well as frustration with both the defense and\nthe appellate court.\n    Nonetheless, on May 4, 2004, the parties and the trial court\nagreed to conduct two hearings simultaneously. Pursuant to the\nagreed mode of procedure, the trial court would consider whether\nthere was sufficient evidence of mental illness to support defendant’s\nplea of guilty but mentally ill, i.e., whether defendant suffered from\n“a substantial disorder of thought, mood, or behavior” which afflicted\nhim at the time of the offense and “impaired his judgment.” See 720\nILCS 5/6–2(d) (West 2004). In the event the court ultimately rejected\nthe GBMI plea, the judge would also consider whether defendant had\nestablished the defense of insanity. The defense stipulated that the\nprosecutor’s previously recited factual basis was sufficient to\nestablish the basic elements of the murder charge. Defendant was\nadmonished regarding the proposed procedure, and consented to it,\nwaiving his right to a jury trial on the guilt/innocence phase.\n    For purposes of the dual proceedings, the trial court admitted and\nconsidered several exhibits documenting psychiatric evaluations of\nthe defendant, and also heard live testimony from expert witnesses.\nThe defense called three witnesses: Drs. Terry Killian, James\nMerikangas, and Daniel Cuneo. The State called two witnesses: Drs.\nJanet Willer and Park Dietz. Written reports of Drs. Killian, Cuneo,\n\n                                 -14-\n\fMerikangas, and Dietz were among the exhibits considered by the\ncourt, as were reports received from two nontestifying defense\nexperts, Drs. Charles Opsahl and Dorothy Otnow Lewis.\n    Dr. Killian, a psychiatrist, believed defendant was legally sane,\nbut mentally ill, at the time of Corum’s murder. Killian diagnosed\ndefendant as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\nbipolar mood disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, obsessive\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), dissociative disorder, Tourette’s,\npersonality disorder, and mild neurological impairment. Killian felt\nthe most significant of these was dissociation, which is something\nlike multiple personalities. Killian believed, in defendant’s case, an\n“angry part” of him “takes some degree of control,” though it “does\nnot appear to be complete control as you would see in a full blown,\nmultiple personality disorder.” Dr. Killian believed defendant was not\nmalingering because he did not volunteer symptoms as he could\nhave. Killian acknowledged that defendant had read a book by Dr.\nLewis, his expert for his unsuccessful insanity defense in Cook\nCounty, and could have feigned symptoms from that book.\n    At one point in his testimony, Killian specifically stated that\ndefendant, in his opinion, “was afflicted by a substantial disorder of\nthought, mood, or behavior which impaired his judgment but not to\nthe extent that he was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his\nbehavior.” Later, Killian was asked by defense counsel whether the\nterm “mentally ill,” as used in section 6–2(d) of the Criminal Code,\nwas consistent with his understanding of that term, as used in his\npractice. At that time, he acknowledged:\n            “Mentally ill is a pretty vague term in a clinical sense.\n        Mentally ill is generally used in psychiatry to refer to a wide\n        range of psychiatric disorders that impair people to mild\n        extents, substantial extents, or impair them to the point where\n        they are unable to function; so it’s a very broad term without\n        a very specific definition in clinical use.”\nKillian explained he could only “describe [defendant’s] symptoms [as\nobserved or described to him],” put those together in “an organized\ndiagnostic formulation,” and explain the “nature of the psychiatric\ndisorders” and the reasons, and extent to which, defendant has them.\nHe concluded, “[I]t is the fact finder’s position to decide whether that\nmeets the burden of the law.”\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f     Dr. Daniel Cuneo, a psychologist, also testified that defendant\n“had a substantial disorder of thought, mood, and behavior which\nimpacted upon his judgment.” Cuneo examined defendant in 2003\nand 2004, and concluded that he suffered from PTSD, bipolar\ndisorder, Tourette’s, OCD, personality disorder, mild neurologic\nimpairment, and a history of sexually transmitted diseases. Unlike\nKillian, who believed that dissociation was the most significant or\nsubstantial of defendant’s mental maladies, Cuneo thought that PTSD\nwas the most significant of defendant’s disorders. Cuneo did believe\nthat the defendant occasionally suffered from episodes of\ndissociation, which occurred during periods of extreme stress. In that\nregard, he noted defendant’s use of the pronoun “we” and the names\nEric, Andy, and Andrew to refer to aspects of his personality. Cuneo\ndid not believe that defendant was malingering.\n     In his report, Cuneo concluded that defendant’s mental illness\n“did not substantially impair his ability to appreciate the criminality\nof his conduct when he is alleged to have killed Cassie Corum. He\ncould have controlled his behavior then and he knew that killing was\nwrong.” However, Cuneo testified to his belief that defendant’s\n“judgment was impaired throughout” due to escalating anger.\n     On cross-examination, Cuneo acknowledged that defendant’s\nactions during the killings exhibited planning and preparation, and\nthat defendant “was clever enough to have killed individuals and hid\nit for a period of time.” Cuneo also conceded that it is possible for a\nperson to be a “clever, mean, sexual, sadistic individual who likes to\nkill women,” yet not suffer from a mental disorder.\n     The prosecutor asked Cuneo about defendant’s “explosive anger,”\nwhich Cuneo believed had resulted in impaired judgment and\nviolence. In posing that question, the prosecutor first noted that\ndefendant had initially become angry with Cassandra Corum at Wolf\nLake, “his favorite murder dumping ground of women.” The\nprosecutor next observed that defendant had restrained her there and\nthen “drove a hundred miles from where he exploded in *** anger\n*** all the way to Pontiac, so he had a whole hour and a half of\ndriving with her.” In light of those circumstances, the prosecutor\nasked whether defendant’s anger would have subsided by the time he\ngot to Pontiac.\n     In response, Cuneo stated that defendant’s debilitating anger\nwould not have subsided until “the murder was done.” He continued,\n\n                                 -16-\n\fclarifying his position: “I don’t believe, at any point, this individual\nwas impaired to the extent that he was unable to think *** what I am\nsaying is that it’s an impairment of judgment ***.”\n    Dr. Merikangas, a psychiatrist, opined that defendant had an\norganic brain disease, which rendered him insane at the time of the\ncrime. Merikangas disagreed with Killian and Cuneo insofar as they\ndiagnosed defendant with PTSD and dissociative personality\ndisorder. Merikangas noted that scans of defendant’s brain in 2002\nshowed atrophy, which might have resulted from improper treatment\nof syphilis. Tests also showed frontal lobe damage, lack of reflexive\nresponse, and decreased blood flow and metabolism in the right\ntemporal lobe of defendant’s brain. Dr. Merikangas believed episodes\nof loss of control and loss of reason were brought on by stress, such\nas sexual situations when defendant was belittled or there was a fight.\nThough Merikangas did not identify a source of stress, he reported\nthat defendant had “a violent attack of rage at the Cook County jail”\nduring Merikangas’ interview with defendant.\n    Dr. Opsahl’s report set forth a diagnosis of “significant\nneuropsychological impairment” and “paranoid psychosis in the\npresence of a cyclic mood disorder that includes elements of both\nhypomania and depression.” The report did not address defendant’s\nbehavior at the time of the murder.\n    Dr. Lewis’ report concluded that defendant was “flamboyantly\npsychotic at the time of the alleged offenses and was operating in\nresponse to delusions and command hallucinations.” Lewis’ report\ncontained statements by defendant that he heard voices that gave him\ninstructions from the CIA. She also reported references to “Andrew\nand Eric” as separate personalities.\n    Dr. Willer, a psychologist who worked for the Veterans\nAdministration, saw defendant approximately 105 times between\n1991 and 1996. She believed defendant suffered from mild\ndepression and avoidant personalty disorder.\n    Dr. Dietz, a psychiatrist, testified, rendering his opinion that, at\nthe time of Corum’s murder, defendant had the capacity “to\nappreciate the criminality of his conduct and to conform his conduct\nto the requirements of the law,” and he did not fit within Illinois’\nstatutory definition of guilty but mentally ill. Dietz concluded that\ndefendant did not have a substantial disorder of thought, mood, or\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fbehavior, as required by the statute. Dietz diagnosed defendant as\nsuffering from Tourette’s syndrome, a personality disorder with\nschizotypal traits, and sexual sadism. He believed it was defendant’s\nanger, rather than a substantial mental disorder, that impaired\ndefendant’s judgment when he murdered Cassandra Corum. Dietz did\nnot believe that defendant had PTSD, but even if he did, Dietz\ncategorized PTSD as an anxiety disorder, not a mental illness; thus,\nit would not meet the definition of mental illness under Illinois law.\nHe also rejected the possibility of organic brain damage because\nneurological tests, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in\n2004, were within the normal range. In Dietz’s opinion, defendant’s\nuse of the passive voice and plural pronouns when describing his\nactions while murdering his victims was nothing more than a\nlinguistic device “to distance himself from responsibility for the\noffense.”\n    Dietz believed that defendant’s judgment was in fact impaired\nwhen he committed the murder, but not by a mental illness. In Dietz’s\nopinion, “nearly everyone” who commits murder “has impaired\njudgment at the time, including this defendant.” Dietz testified that\nanger was the “one clearly provable element that impaired\n[defendant’s] judgment.” However, Dietz identified two other “prime\ncandidates” as “sexual desire” and “a kind of predatory desire for\nconquest.” The latter observations were consistent with Dietz’s\ndiagnosis that defendant was a sexual sadist, which he defined as one\nwho exhibits “an enduring pattern of sexual excitement or desire\ninvolving the infliction of pain or the humiliation of others.”\n    Dietz based his diagnosis of sexual sadism primarily upon the\naccount given by defendant’s sole surviving victim, J.A. As Dietz\nnoted, her description of defendant’s behavior at the time he raped\nand tortured her is the only description of defendant’s criminal\nactions that was not given by defendant. Dietz summarized J.A.’s\naccount of her ordeal as follows:\n        “[In] that incident he called her a bitch, held a knife to her\n        throat, pulled her head into the dashboard, bound her hands\n        behind her back, pulled her by the hair to force fellatio, cut\n        off her shorts, underwear and bra, gagged her with her\n        underwear and bra, called her a bitch, a whore, a slut, as he\n        raped her vaginally, scripted her language, namely telling her\n        exactly what to say. He directed her to say that she loved him.\n\n                                 -18-\n\f        Hit her, strangled her to the point of unconsciousness, and bit\n        her neck drawing blood. That is a classic textbook description\n        of the abducting and rape of a woman by a sexual sadist.\n        Because he is demeaning her, controlling her, causing her\n        pain while experiencing sexual excitement. Every feature of\n        that is exactly what we expect to find in sexually sadistic\n        types. And the significance of [J.A.’s] account is that she is\n        the only living victim of rape and abduction that can tell us\n        what defendant actually does with a victim. For every other\n        case, that is the eight homicides, we only know what the\n        corpse can tell us and what the defendant is willing to say.”\nDietz acknowledged that a single incident is not sufficient to\ndiagnose sexual sadism, so he supported his diagnosis with another\nreported incident–one that led to defendant’s arrest–in which a\nprostitute described a 1997 encounter with defendant. Patricia Kelly\nreported that defendant had asked her to accompany him to the Wolf\nLake area and allow him to handcuff her, duct tape her, tie her up,\nand have sex with her in the back of his truck. Dietz believed that\nrequest was also suggestive of sexual sadism. Dietz answered\naffirmatively when the prosecutor asked whether there were “some\nsimilarities concerning binding and gagging and binding and abusing\nthe other victims even though they are not here to tell us.” Finally,\nDietz reported that defendant had acknowledged that there is a part\nof him “that enjoys torture, that would like to inflict as much damage\nas possible, that enjoys bondage and sadomasochistic activity, that\nwants to control.”\n    At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the hearing, the\ncircuit court indicated it would entertain arguments of counsel.\nAttorney Skelton then asked the court: “What standard is the Court\napplying concerning the existence of the factual basis for the\nexistence of mental illness at the time of the offense?” An extended\ndiscussion ensued between the parties and the court concerning the\nappropriate standards and evidentiary burdens the court would apply,\nwith the defense arguing that the court had no authority to weigh the\nevidence adduced on the issue of mental illness. At the conclusion of\nthat discussion, the court stated its belief that cases pertaining to\nuncontested guilty pleas would not apply to defendant’s plea of guilty\nbut mentally ill, since the State, in this case, was contesting whether\ndefendant was in fact mentally ill as defined in section 6–2(d) of the\n\n                                 -19-\n\fCriminal Code. The court nonetheless commented that “the burden\nthe defense has at this proceeding *** dealing with whether the court\nshould accept or reject the plea of guilty but mentally ill is not a\npreponderance of the evidence. That would be the case at bench trial.\nIt is less than that.” However, the court still determined that it should\n“weigh” the evidence presented at the hearing, noting that defendant\nwas not entitled to have the court “simply disregard the evidence\npresented by the State.” Following arguments of the parties, the court\nindicated it would recess over the weekend to consider the evidence\nand arguments.\n     On the morning of May 10, 2004, the court announced its rulings\nin chambers in order to protect the defendant from media coverage\nand to ensure that the sentencing jury would not be tainted when it\nlater heard evidence of mental illness. First, having weighed the\nevidence presented by the defense and the prosecution, the trial judge\nstated he was not satisfied that a factual basis existed to support\ndefendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill, noting that “the evidence\nfails to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the\ndefendant was guilty but mentally ill at the time of the incident\ncomplained of.” Moreover, the court ruled that defendant had not\nestablished, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was insane\nat the time of Corum’s murder. Finally, the court found the State had\nproven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of first\ndegree murder as charged in the indictment.\n     In support of his ruling, the trial judge noted that the principal\ndefense witnesses disagreed in their primary diagnoses. Cuneo\nbelieved that defendant suffered, primarily, from PTSD; Killian’s\nprincipal diagnosis was dissociation; and Merikangas determined that\ndefendant suffered from organic brain disease, disagreeing with\nKillian’s and Cuneo’s diagnoses of PTSD and dissociative\npersonality disorder. Killian and Cuneo believed that defendant was\nlegally sane, but mentally ill, as defined in section 6–2(d);\nMerikangas testified that defendant was insane, as defined in section\n6–2(a).\n     The court also found that defendant’s experts had failed to\nexplain how defendant was able to function in society during his\nseven years in the Marine Corps, or employed as a security guard,\nwhile suffering from the diagnosed illnesses. The court found that\ndefendant’s actions during the offense were inconsistent with those\n\n                                  -20-\n\fof a person overcome by anger. To the contrary, they demonstrated\nplanning and organization. The court rejected the assessments of\nMerikangas and Killian that defendant’s crimes were not\ncharacterized by planning and organization, noting that defendant\nbrought a gun, a knife, duct tape, and handcuffs. The court\nconcluded, “the defendant went prepared and in fact successfully\ncarried out this murder as well as seven others.” With respect to the\ndefendant’s psychiatric evaluations, the court observed that defendant\nhad “learned some things” about evaluations in the course of his\nunsuccessful trial in Cook County. As Killian acknowledged in his\ntestimony, defendant had read Lewis’ book, titled “Guilty But\nMentally Ill.”\n    The trial judge found the testimony of Dr. Dietz “substantially\nmore persuasive and more convincing than that of the defense\nexperts.” As noted, Dietz believed that defendant was not legally\ninsane and he did not meet the statutory criterion for a finding of\nguilty but mentally ill. The court accepted Dietz’s assessment that\ndefendant is a sexual sadist and is “angry at the world and his\nunsuccessful circumstances in life.” The court stated: “[T]o rule in\nfavor of the defense, I would have to totally set aside the testimony\nof Dr. Park Dietz, which *** I find to be the most convincing and\npersuasive of the witnesses,” and “even more importantly, to find in\nfavor of the defense, I would have to disregard the facts of this case.”\n    After announcing his ruling, and before convening in open court,\nthe trial judge revisited the issue of courtroom security, noting that\nthe jury would not see the shackling of defendant because of skirting\naround defendant’s table, reiterating his earlier findings, and\nenunciating two additional factors. The court noted, since its original\nruling regarding the physical restraint of defendant, the court had\nbeen apprised of the full extent and scope of defendant’s homicidal\nactivities in California, and had heard psychiatric testimony\npertaining to defendant’s explosive personality. With those additional\ncomments, the court inquired of defense counsel:\n             “THE COURT: So that is the record on shackling. I guess\n         I should give the defense an opportunity to suggest that I do\n         something differently. I would ask Mr. Skelton and Mr.\n         Elmore, are you asking that I do something differently on\n         shackling than I have decided to do?\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f             MR. SKELTON: Given the totality of the circumstances\n         and the discretion given the Court which I believe is an\n         accurate assessment of the physical layout of the courtroom\n         and the shackling devices and means by which our client is\n         secured in the courtroom, I don’t think it is an issue, Judge.\n             THE COURT: All right. Mr. Elmore.\n             MR. ELMORE: No, Judge. I think what you have done is\n         appropriate under the circumstances.”\n     The court then advanced the proceeding to the eligibility phase of\nsentencing. Defendant waived a jury for the purpose of determining\nwhether he was eligible for the death penalty. Without objection, the\nState introduced defendant’s birth certificate, showing him to be over\n18 years of age, and certified copies of defendant’s two murder\nconvictions in Cook County. The trial court subsequently found that\ndefendant was over the age of 18 when he murdered Cassandra\nCorum and he had been previously convicted of murdering two\nwomen in Cook County, thereby establishing his eligibility for a\ndeath sentence under section 9–1(b)(3) of the Criminal Code (720\nILCS 5/9–1(b)(3) (West 2004)).\n     At the beginning of the third phase of this capital proceeding, the\ntrial court advised the jurors of developments in the first two\nphases–to which the court had referred during jury\nselection–explaining why jurors had not participated in earlier stages\nof the proceeding, and bringing the jurors current on findings made\nduring the initial phases of the trial. The court read the jurors the\nstatutory definition of insanity, and advised jurors that the court,\npursuant to defendant’s jury waivers, had determined (1) that the\nState had proven defendant guilty of Corum’s murder beyond a\nreasonable doubt, (2) that defendant had not proven by a\npreponderance of the evidence that he was legally insane at the time\nof the offense, and (3) that defendant was eligible for the death\npenalty because he was over 18 years of age at the time of the offense\nand had been previously convicted of murdering two or more\npersons. The court noted that those findings were binding upon the\njury, and informed the jury that its function would be to determine\nwhether death was the appropriate sentence. With that, the parties\ngave their opening statements.\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f    Early in defense counsel’s statement to the jury, he acknowledged\nthat the trial judge had rejected defendant’s “plea of insanity,” but he\nadvised the jurors that they could “still consider the background of\nMr. Urdiales *** to see whether or not, not that he is insane, but did\nhe suffer from any mental illness or mental disease or mental defects.\nDid it reduce his ability to think and act? Did it reduce his ability to\nperform like a normal, healthy person?” Counsel told the jurors,\n“Those are facts that you must also consider.”\n    Later, when describing the harsh conditions of incarceration,\nwhich he likened to life “in a cage,” counsel again stated, “The\nevidence will show that while Andrew Urdiales is not insane, *** he\nsuffers from mental illness or mental disease.” Still later, counsel\nstated:\n        “Mr. Urdiales, in fact, does suffer from defects of the brain.\n        And so the question then becomes do we as a society treat\n        someone who is mentally ill as opposed to someone who is\n        mentally healthy the same. And we suggest not. We suggest\n        that the most appropriate way is to punish by life in prison\n        without the possibility of parole.”\nCounsel concluded his opening statement with yet another reference\nto defendant’s mental illness. With the conclusion of opening\nstatements, the State presented evidence in aggravation.\n    In aggravation, the State presented evidence of the eight murders\ncommitted by defendant, as well as J.A.’s testimony describing how\ndefendant kidnapped, raped, and attempted to murder her. In the\ninterests of brevity, we will substantially summarize that evidence,\nwhich is derived from police investigations of the crime scenes and\nfrom interviews with defendant. We note that defendant’s description\nof events did not always agree with the physical evidence discovered\nat the crime scenes, as was the case with the murder of Cassandra\nCorum; however, to simplify the descriptions of the murders, we will\ngenerally recount defendant’s version of events.\n    Defendant’s first murder victim was Robbin Brandley, a\nCalifornia college student he killed in January of 1986. At that time,\ndefendant was in the Marines and stationed at Camp Pendleton in\nCalifornia. Defendant told police he was upset about some\nfriendships at the base, so he decided to rob someone. Defendant took\na “big old hunting knife,” approximately 11 inches long, and drove\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fto a college just north of Camp Pendleton. When he arrived, he took\nup a position in a poorly lit area and waited for someone to walk by.\nWhen defendant saw Brandley, he came up behind her, put his hand\nover her mouth, and told her he wanted her purse. She immediately\ncomplied; however, defendant just put the purse on the hood of her\ncar and began stabbing her in the back. After she fell to the ground,\ndefendant stabbed her several more times in the chest. Once, when\ndefendant stabbed her in the ribs, the knife got stuck, and he had to\nstep on her body in order to remove it. Defendant left Brandley in the\nparking lot to die, having stabbed her a total of 41 times in the back,\nhands, neck, and chest. Defendant told police that his victim “could\nhave been anybody,” and that Brandley “was just a random female.”\n    After the murder, defendant had blood on his jeans, jacket, and\nhands. In order to conceal the blood, and get back on the base,\ndefendant rubbed grease from his car’s engine over his clothes to\nhide the blood. When he returned to the base, defendant told the\nmilitary police that his car had broken down and he had to fix it. The\npolice believed defendant’s story, which made defendant think they\nwere “dumb shits.”\n    Defendant indicated he had the same knife with him when he\nlater had sex with a prostitute in Hollywood. Defendant said, “[S]he\nwas lucky.”\n    In July of 1988, defendant committed his second murder, killing\nJulie McGhee in Cathedral City, California. Defendant picked up\nMcGhee on a road frequented by prostitutes and drove her to a\nremote construction area, where they had sex. Afterwards, defendant\ngot his gun and ordered McGhee out of the car. When she got out, he\nshot her in the head. Defendant noted he “really didn’t feel anything”\nafter killing McGhee. He said it was “just so quiet and peaceful” that\nhe got in his car and drove to a bar where he “had some beers and\nwatched the girls dance.”\n    In September of 1988, defendant killed his third victim, Mary\nAnn Wells. Defendant picked up Wells, who was working as a\nprostitute, and drove her to an industrial area in San Diego, where\nthey had sex. After he finished, defendant shot Wells, recovered the\n$40 he had paid her, dumped her body in an alley, and drove away.\n    Defendant murdered Tammy Erwin in Palm Springs in April of\n1989. Defendant had had sex with Erwin on at least one occasion\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fprior to April 1989. On the night of the murder, defendant picked up\nErwin and took her to a vacant lot, where she performed oral sex on\nhim. Defendant did not remember arguing with Erwin, but he did\nrecall shooting her while he was outside of his truck. After defendant\nshot Erwin, he got into his truck to leave, but noticed that Erwin was\nstill standing up, clutching her head. Without getting out of his truck,\ndefendant shot Erwin a second time, after which she fell to the\nground. Defendant shot her a third time, before driving off.\n     Defendant was discharged from the Marines in 1991, and moved\nback to Chicago to live with his parents. In September of 1992,\ndefendant returned to California for a short visit. During that visit, he\nkidnapped, raped, and attempted to murder J.A.\n      In his statement to police, defendant indicated he first saw J.A.\nat a bus stop and offered her a ride. En route to J.A.’s house-sitting\njob, defendant obtained a telephone number from J.A., which he\nsubsequently determined was a “bum” number. The next morning,\ndefendant waited for J.A. to get off work and offered her to take her\nout for breakfast. J.A. agreed, and got in the car.\n     Defendant later related he was “just feeling upset about the\nnumber or something,” and “something was just kind of building up,\nyou know, tension.” After driving a short distance, defendant stopped\nthe car, reached over and grabbed J.A. by the hair, and produced a\ngun. Defendant observed that J.A. became “pretty much submissive\nfrom that part forward.” Defendant ordered J.A. to turn around, and\nhe tied her hands behind her back. Defendant later told a police\nofficer:\n         “I think *** before we started moving after I tied her hands\n         up, I reached over and I kissed her. I just put my lips on her\n         mouth and then I just started, you know, I was trying to make\n         out with her.”\nWhen defendant started driving again, J.A. told defendant she would\ndo anything he wanted, so defendant unzipped his pants, pulled J.A.’s\nhead down, and said “suck my dick” or “suck my cock.” J.A. then\nperformed oral sex on defendant until he tired of it and “picked her\nback up.” In an interview with police, defendant remarked: “She kept\nasking me where we were going and she’ll do anything I want. Shit\nlike that, you know.”\n\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\f     Defendant drove out into the desert, stopping at one point to cut\nJ.A.’s panties and bra off. Defendant then rolled up J.A.’s panties and\nstuffed them in her mouth. Defendant eventually “tried to rape” J.A..\nDefendant said she “tried to help” him, but “nothing happened”\nbecause he could not achieve an erection. After a while, defendant\nbecame angry and the “tension” began to build. Defendant said he\nbegan to choke J.A., “and she kept kicking and *** her saliva was\ncoming out of her mouth and *** her face was turning blue and then\nred and it was just a battle *** for a while.” Eventually, defendant’s\nhand started to get tired and stiff, so he got off J.A. and sat down.\n     Thereafter, defendant got his gun and pulled J.A. out of the car.\nHe forced her to her knees and again made her perform oral sex on\nhim. Defendant eventually tired of that. Frustrated, he grabbed J.A.,\nwalked her to the back of the car, forced her into the trunk, and drove\noff. At some point during the drive, the lid of the trunk popped open\nand defendant stopped to slam it shut. Before defendant could get\nunderway again, the trunk popped open a second time, J.A. jumped\nout, and she ran away screaming. Defendant later told detectives his\nfirst thought was to shoot her, but he decided against it because there\nwere several cars nearby. Defendant got into his car and drove away.\nHe told the police: “So that was the last time I saw her. I don’t know\nif somebody else picked her up and finished where I started.”\n     J.A., defendant’s sole surviving victim, testified at the\ndefendant’s sentencing hearing. Because J.A.’s testimony provides\nunique insight into defendant’s activities with one of his victims, and\nthe perspective of that victim, we discuss J.A.’s testimony at length.\n     J.A. said she accepted a ride with defendant on the evening of\nSeptember 27, 1992, because she would otherwise have been late for\nwork. Defendant repeatedly asked her for her phone number, so she\neventually gave him a fake number. He then dropped her off at work.\n     The next morning, as J.A. left work, defendant drove up behind\nher and asked her if she wanted to get some breakfast. J.A. recalled\nthat defendant “looked friendly again, just kind of smiling like. I\nwasn’t scared of him.” So, J.A. got into defendant’s car.\n     Defendant soon confronted J.A. about the fake phone number.\nWhen she denied giving him the wrong number, defendant became\nangry. He pulled the car to the side of the road and produced a knife\nand twine. J.A. said, before she “even [had] time to think to jump out\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fof the car,” defendant had the knife to her throat. He pushed her head\ninto the dashboard, calling her a “whore, a bitch, and kinds of crazy\nthings.” He then grabbed her arms behind her back and tied them\ntogether with the twine. Defendant hit J.A. and displayed a gun. J.A.\ntestified she felt “totally helpless.” She recalled, “I was in his control\ntotally; and I even told him, I let him know that I was.” As defendant\nstarted to drive again, he grabbed J.A.’s head and forced her to\nperform oral sex on him.\n    Defendant drove into the desert and stopped the car. J.A. testified\nthat she feared defendant would become even more aggressive if she\nattempted to resist him, so she said, “[I]f you are going to rape me,\nrape me. But please don’t kill me ***.” Defendant did not respond.\nHe proceeded to pull off her shorts and shoes, hitting her in the head\nwith one of her shoes. Defendant then cut off J.A.’s panties with his\nknife and shoved them into her mouth, causing her to vomit and gag.\nAfter that, defendant cut off J.A.’s bra and tied it tightly around her\nmouth.\n    J.A. testified that defendant then raped her, an ordeal that she\ndescribed in graphic detail:\n         “And then he spread my legs open, and then he had sex with\n         me. And then he was hitting on me and just staring at me; and\n         then he was calling me a bitch, a whore, a slut, and I was just\n         crying. *** Then he told me to tell him that I loved him. ***\n         I thought it was kind of stupid because I had underwear\n         shoved down my throat and a bra tied around my mouth; and\n         I was thinking, how *** am I going to say anything ***? I’m\n         gagged. So I just looked into his eyes; and he was saying, say\n         it, bitch, say it. And I just looked into his eyes; and I tried to\n         say like, hello, I can’t say anything. I’ve got stuff in my\n         mouth. And when I tried to talk, I would just gag. *** I think\n         he finally realized that I couldn’t talk with the underwear\n         down my throat so he took it off. And he said, say it, bitch.”\nWhen J.A. said it, it–not surprisingly–sounded insincere. She\nobserved, “It sounded like I was saying it so I wouldn’t die.”\nDefendant said, “You are lying,” and struck J.A. again. He repeatedly\nurged her: “[S]ay it. Say it. Tell me you love me like you mean it.”\n    When J.A. was unable to do so in a satisfactory manner,\ndefendant started strangling her with his hands. J.A. testified:\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\f          “He just grabbed me by the throat and started strangling me\n          until my eyes started rolling back in my head; and then he\n          was yelling at me, calling me a bitch, a slut, a whore. And\n          this whole time I was just so confused, thinking, oh my God,\n          I’m going to die. *** I thought about everybody, and I was\n          wishing some way they could know what my final thoughts\n          were before I died because there was no way, there was no\n          way nobody was going to know anything; and that was the\n          scariest part was that something like this could happen when\n          people are just driving around and going about their day; and\n          I’m in the desert about to be murdered.”\nJ.A. either lost consciousness momentarily or went into shock. She\ntestified she could not feel anything for a while. During that period,\nwhich she described as “really peaceful,” she thought she had died,\nand she felt “happy.” However, that momentary respite passed, and\nJ.A. soon realized that defendant was still choking her, “whipping\n[her] back and forth trying to get [her] back to it.” She related, “And\nthen all of a sudden I just came back to it, and I could feel everything\nagain.”\n     J.A. testified that defendant then began fondling her breasts and\n“sucking” on her neck. Simultaneously, she felt something cold\nrunning down her neck. When defendant stopped, he put his face in\nfront of hers. It was then that she noticed defendant had blood on his\nteeth, and J.A. started to panic again. She recounted: “I knew he tried\nto bite me; but I couldn’t feel it because I was in such bad shock\nsome of the things I didn’t even feel. But then he opened the door.”\n     Defendant exited the car with his gun, and pulled J.A. out of the\ncar by her hair. With his pants down, defendant ordered J.A. to “suck\nit, bitch.” J.A. initially refused. She recalled: “I just wanted to die so\nI said no. And I was hoping that he would just shoot me because I\ncouldn’t take it anymore, and I wanted to go back to that state I was\nin a little while ago.” Defendant again ordered J.A. to “suck it,” and\nhe hit her in the head for emphasis. J.A. resolved to “suck it” and\n“bite it off.” However, immediately after she began, defendant\n“nailed [her] in the head again.” She recalled, “[H]e got really upset\nbecause it wasn’t erect to suck it. It was never erect the whole time,\nand I think that makes him really mad.”\n     Defendant then left J.A. for a moment, removing a bag, with\n“knife blades sticking of it,” from the trunk of the car, and placing it\n\n                                  -28-\n\fin the backseat. J.A. seized the opportunity and tried to escape. She\ntestified: “I started running through the field as fast as I could; and I\ncould see nothing. I could see no roads. I could see nothing; and I\nknew I was doomed; but if I’m going to die, I want to at least ***\nhave someone say that I tried to run.” Defendant eventually caught\nJ.A. by the hair, “ripped it back,” and she fell to the ground.\nDefendant began to drag the partially naked J.A. through cacti and\nback to the car.\n    When he got J.A. back to the car, defendant decided to put her in\nthe trunk. J.A. stated, “I just wanted him to kill me; and he decided\nnot to kill me right then.” Defendant tried to force J.A. into the trunk,\nand she resisted. She recalled: “I thought if I go into this trunk *** I\nam going to be dead. But he kept prolonging it and prolonging it; and\nit was driving me mentally insane.”\n    Defendant was eventually able to force J.A. into the trunk. J.A.,\nwho was tied with twine and clad only in a sweatshirt, thought “about\nbeing chopped up.” She thought she would be taken somewhere and\nwould be “hacked up in pieces.” She tried to kill herself by holding\nher breath and by bashing her head against the inside of the trunk.\nShe recalled, “I didn’t want him to kill me. I wanted to kill myself.”\n    When J.A. was unsuccessful in that attempt, she suffered through\nperiods of panic, and eventually experienced a loss of energy, “like\n*** having a seizure.” J.A. said she then started to pray. After\npraying, she got “really, really calm.” J.A. testified: “I just got all of\nmy energy together; and then I just stretched my arms hardly; and all\nof the twine just busted right off my hands.”\n    Having freed herself, J.A. again succumbed to panic and despair.\nShe testified:\n         “And I kept saying, now what, God? *** I’m in a frickin’\n         trunk. How am I going to get out of this? And so I just lost\n         hope again; and I got the twine; and I wound it up; and I put\n         it around my neck; and I squeezed it really tight; and I was\n         trying to choke myself. *** I couldn’t strangle myself. And\n         I couldn’t think of any other way to kill myself.”\n    J.A. briefly entertained the idea of fighting defendant when he\nopened the trunk, but she quickly decided against it, concluding,\n“He’ll pull me out. We’ll struggle. One of us will die. Probably me\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fsince I have no weapons.” So, J.A. resolved to try and escape from\nthe trunk.\n    J.A. eventually found the latch of the trunk. She recalled she\n“pushed something, pulled something, turned something, and it went\nclick.” She lifted the trunk a little bit and there was “light\neverywhere.” J.A.’s state of mind was such that she initially\ncontemplated whether to “jump out and get run over and die,” which\nshe “really didn’t mind” at that point, or to actually try to save\nherself. She decided on the latter course, and raised the trunk lid in\nsuch a way as to draw defendant’s attention.\n    Defendant quickly pulled over, and shortly thereafter appeared at\nthe rear of the car with his gun. Defendant slammed the trunk lid\nclosed and yelled, “Don’t open that trunk, bitch. I’ll shoot out the\nback seat.” He then got back in the car, but was unable to drive away\nbecause the car had become stuck in the soft sand.\n    Defendant kept trying to move the car while he intermittently\nthreatened to kill J.A. if she tried to open the trunk again. J.A.\neventually unlatched the trunk a second time, jumped out, and ran. As\nshe did so, she looked back and saw defendant in pursuit with a\nmachete. As she ran, J.A. tried to get motorists to stop, but they\nwould just drive by. Finally, she saw a truck coming. J.A. recounted:\n“So I just ran in front of it with my eyes closed because I thought he\nwas real near to me so I wanted to be run over before I was hit with\nthat [machete].” The occupants of the truck, two Marines, grabbed\nJ.A. and put her in their truck. When she told them what had\nhappened, they initially began chasing defendant, until she told them\nhe was heavily armed, at which point they desisted. The two Marines\ntook J.A. to a nearby gas station; the police were called; and J.A. was\nthereafter taken to hospital.\n    Under cross-examination, J.A. acknowledged that she still has the\nexperience “following [her] around” and that she is now “different\nmentally.”\n    Three years after he kidnapped, raped, and attempted to kill J.A.,\ndefendant murdered Denise Maney in Palm Springs. During a\nvacation to California in March of 1995, defendant picked up Maney\nin the same area where he had earlier picked up McGhee and Erwin.\nDefendant drove Maney to the desert, and stopped the car on a\ndeserted side road, where he ordered Maney to strip and perform oral\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fsex on him. Defendant said he got “tired” of that after a while, so he\ngrabbed Maney by the hair, walked her over to the front of the car,\nand told her to lie face down on the ground. Defendant got on top of\nher and tied her hands behind her back. He again directed her to\nperform fellatio. However, defendant said, he “wasn’t really feeling\nsatisfied,” so he turned Maney over on her knees and “shoved” one\nof his fingers into Maney’s anus. Maney screamed. Defendant\nrecalled, “And then after awhile I drove in two fingers. I just kept\ngoing–shoving my fingers in her ass. *** And that went on for a\nwhile. I just kept doing that to her.” Defendant said, when he got tired\nof that, he picked her up and walked her toward the desert. When she\nturned around, defendant put his gun in her mouth. “And then it went\noff.” The gunshot blew off the back of Maney’s head.\n    Defendant stated: “Then she fell and she was still like gurgling\n*** making a lot of noises. But I had some blood on me a little bit\nand the gun[,] so I just walked away.” Defendant got in his car, and\nstarted to drive away, but he eventually stopped. Defendant stated: “I\ndidn’t feel nothing *** I didn’t really think. I just kind of like\nwiped–cleaned my hand off a little bit and I stopped, turned around\nand I went back to her.” Defendant then described his mood as\n“angry” and “very upset.” He said, this time, he took his knife out.\n    In relating what he did next, defendant slipped back and forth\nbetween use of the singular pronoun “I” and the plural pronoun “we.”\nHe told the police:\n         “[W]e took the knife out and we went back toward the–back\n         to her where she was lying at we just started stabbing for\n         some reason. Just on the body several times, in the chest\n         maybe, stomach. *** I remember I made a slashing motion\n         by the throat. *** Then we went back to the car. And I–we,\n         we–picked up her clothes. *** Then we were driving, we just\n         started driving ***.”\nDefendant said he threw most of Maney’s belongings on the side of\nthe road. However, he said, alternately: “We just *** I just” buried\n“her panties and her little lingerie stuff.”\n    Defendant murdered a sixth woman, Laura Uylaki, in April of\n1996. Defendant told police he met Uylaki in the winter of 1995-96,\nand they went out a few times. He and Uylaki had sex twice at Wolf\nLake in a sleeping bag defendant kept in the back of his truck. In\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fApril of 1996, defendant again picked up Uylaki and they drove to\nWolf Lake. On the way, they began to argue. According to defendant,\nwhen they arrived at Wolf Lake, defendant took his loaded .38-\ncaliber revolver from underneath the driver’s seat and was “showing\nit to Laura,” when the gun went off, shooting a hole in the roof of the\ntruck. Defendant stated, after his gun went off, “Laura got mad and\nall hell broke loose.”\n     Defendant claimed that Uylaki grabbed for his gun, breaking his\nleft index finger in the process. He said she then jumped out of the\ntruck and began to run. Defendant stated that he followed her and\nfired “a couple more times” in her direction. She fell to the ground.\nWhen he determined that she was dead, he decided to throw her body\ninto the lake. According to defendant’s version of events, he then\ntook off her clothes, carried her body to the lake, and pushed her in.\nThereafter, defendant said he drove back to Chicago, and on the way,\nhe threw Uylaki’s clothes from the passenger side of his truck.\n     Defendant told police he met Lynn Huber, his seventh murder\nvictim, in the summer of 1996, when she was working as a prostitute\nin Chicago. Defendant said they had sex a couple of times that\nsummer. One evening in late July or early August of 1996, defendant\nsaw Huber carrying a large garbage bag full of clothes. He stopped\nand offered her a ride, which she accepted. According to defendant,\nhe pulled into an alley to have sex with Huber, but she started arguing\nwith him and “acting kind of ditzy.” Defendant said that Huber tried\nto get out of the truck, but he grabbed her and shot her in the head,\nusing the loaded gun he kept under his seat.\n     Defendant stated he then put Huber’s body in the bed of the truck\nand drove to Wolf Lake. In defendant’s version of events, he then\nremoved Huber’s clothing and, in the process, pricked his finger with\na needle. Defendant claimed that made him angry enough that he\ntook out a knife, stabbed her “a lot of times” in the back, and shot her\nagain. Defendant dragged her body to the lake and threw her in.\nDefendant later disposed of the clothes Huber had been wearing and\ngave her bag of clothes to the Salvation Army. Defendant observed,\n“[S]he won’t need them anymore.”\n     Defendant told police he killed his eighth and final murder\nvictim, Cassandra Corum, on the night of July 13, 1996. Defendant\nsaid he had known Corum for about two years prior to the murder.\nOn the night of the murder, defendant met Corum in a Hammond,\n\n                                 -32-\n\fIndiana, bar and the two drove to Wolf Lake, where they had sex.\nAccording to defendant, Corum said something that made him\nangry–though he could not remember what–so he hit her in the face\nseveral times with his fist and open hand. Defendant stated that\nCorum started to become afraid and panicked, “so she began to fight\n*** back.” Defendant said it was at that point that he forced Corum’s\nhands behind her back and handcuffed her. He also claimed he then\nremoved her clothing. Defendant told police that Corum “seemed\nnumb with anxiety and fear. So she became passive and submissive.”\nDefendant then bound her feet together with duct tape, put duct tape\nover her mouth, and positioned her so that her head was in his lap.\n    Defendant said he was “still pissed off” so he began driving\nsouth, down Interstate 55. He recalled he had driven “for a couple\nhours or so” when he started getting tired. At that point, he pulled off\nthe interstate and continued driving until he went over a bridge that\ncrossed a river. He then drove into a little park and shut off his truck.\nDefendant claimed he removed the duct tape and handcuffs from\nCorum–though that assertion is inconsistent with the state in which\nher body was found. Defendant said he and the still-naked Corum\nexited the truck. Defendant had gotten his gun from beneath the\ndriver’s seat of his truck. Defendant stated that Corum had walked to\nthe back of the truck, and had turned to face him, as if to say\nsomething, when he pointed the gun at her and fired once. She fell to\nthe ground. Because he was still mad at her for fighting and biting\nhim, he then got his knife out of the truck and stabbed her “a few\ntimes.”\n    Thereafter, defendant picked up her body, carried it to the bridge,\nand dumped the body into the river. He observed that he “didn’t feel\nanything for Cassie *** she was just a whore.” He added that he was\n“trained to kill in the Marine Corps.” Defendant said he drove back\ntowards home, throwing Corum’s clothes out the window on the way.\nHe noted they were “just garbage *** and there was no sense in\nkeeping them.”\n    As noted, much of the foregoing evidence comes from\ndefendant’s own statements to police. At sentencing, Detective Don\nMcGrath of the Chicago police department testified that he escorted\ndefendant back to the lock-up after the interviews. McGrath testified,\nwhen they got to the lock-up door, defendant looked at McGrath and\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fsaid: “Well, you know, I’m kind of glad in a way that you caught me.\n*** I was starting to get the urge again.”\n    When the State had finished presenting aggravating evidence of\ndefendant’s criminal activity, the parties and the court discussed the\ncommencement of the defense case in mitigation. In that regard,\ndefense counsel stated his intention of introducing the psychiatrists’\nreports into evidence and asking that the reports go back to the jury.\nThe State objected to the reports going back to the jury, arguing that\nthe experts should testify in person and “be subject to cross-\nexamination.” The court expressed concern, noting that the reports in\nquestion were “extremely voluminous” and that Dr. Killian’s report\nalone was 75 pages long. The trial judge advised the parties:\n        “I’m not limiting either the direct or cross-examination of a\n        particular expert. So you want to have an expert on the stand\n        for two days, that’s fine with me. You can go over his entire\n        report if you like. *** [I]f all those questions are then asked\n        of a witness, then the opposite side knows what to cross on.\n        *** So the only point I’m making is that there is an unlimited\n        opportunity to inquire of these experts.”\nThe trial court subsequently ruled that the reports would not be sent\nback to the jury, noting, inter alia, “that’s why we have the experts\ntestifying because we are in a realm beyond the normal knowledge\nof the jurors.”\n    With that, the defense commenced its case in mitigation. In\nmitigation, the defendant called Drs. Merikangas and Killian, Kendra\nMoses, a mitigation expert, Roger Cowan, former warden of Menard\nCorrectional Center, and Steven Hardy, a clinical psychologist.\n    Kendra Moses, a defense mitigation specialist, testified regarding\nnegative and positive experiences in defendant’s life and the impact\nof defendant’s conduct on his family. Moses observed that defendant\nwas the youngest of six children. The Urdiales family was “fairly\nclose” prior to defendant’s arrest for the Cook County murders;\nhowever, that is no longer the case. As of the time of trial, the only\nfamily members who regularly visited defendant in prison were his\nparents, his sister, Cynthia, and her son. All of the siblings and\ngrandchildren, except for Cynthia and her son, stopped visiting\ndefendant’s parents once they learned of the Cook County murders.\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f    Moses noted that defendant’s oldest brother, Alfred, was killed\nin Vietnam when defendant was three or four years old. Defendant\nwas “very close” to Alfred. According to family members, defendant\nwould sit on the porch and wait for his brother to come home, not\nunderstanding that his brother had died.\n    Alfred’s death impacted defendant in another sense as well. After\nAlfred was killed, defendant’s mother suffered through an “extended\nperiod” of depression for “two or three years.” She had “trouble\ncontinuing to function in her everyday life.” Moses testified it was\nduring that period of time that defendant’s older sisters, Cynthia and\nMonica, became his primary caretakers.\n    Moses suggested it was “in that environment that Monica\neventually started to sexually abuse” defendant, though it would\nappear that the abuse–reported by defendant to have taken place\nwhen he was 11 years old and Monica was 13 or 14–would have\ntaken place approximately four years after defendant’s mother’s\nperiod of depression. In any event, defendant told his psychologist\nand Moses that Monica had sexually abused him on several occasions\nand the abuse caused him intense feelings of fear and helplessness.\n    Moses further testified that defendant was subjected to bullying,\nbeatings, and harassment from third grade through eighth grade. She\nexplained that the Urdiales family–of Mexican origin–moved to\nBurnham, Illinois, when defendant was in third grade. They were the\nonly family of Hispanic heritage living in the area. That ethnic\ndifference, as well as defendant’s small size and the developing\nsymptoms of Tourette’s syndrome, led to neighborhood children\nharassing, chasing and physically attacking him on his way home\nfrom school. In one instance, the police were called. The harassment\nwas so bad that the family moved back to Chicago when defendant\nwas in high school.\n    Defendant’s parents believed that defendant’s experiences\ngrowing up in Burnham made him “very anxious socially.” He did\nnot develop friendships easily and in fact “had at various times\nmaybe one friend that he would play with or hang out with.” As he\ngot older, defendant was “fearful” around girls and did not date.\n    When defendant graduated from high school, he enlisted in the\nMarines, serving from 1984 until he was honorably discharged in\n1991. Moses described defendant’s experience in the military as “not\n\n\n                                -35-\n\fa failed career,” but certainly “not the success he hoped it would be.”\nMoses indicated that defendant did not make friends in the Marines\nand he had some unspecified difficulties.\n     When defendant was discharged from the Marines, he moved\nback to Chicago, where he lived with his parents. He is the godfather\nof Cynthia’s son, Brian, and the two were described as “very close.”\nMoses testified that defendant had a close relationship with all of his\nnieces and nephews.\n     Finally, Moses testified that defendant did seek counseling\nthrough the Veteran’s Administration after his discharge from the\nMarines. He was referred to psychologist Janet Willer. He advised\nDr. Willer that he needed help dealing with his temper and an\ninferiority complex. He also spoke to Willer about childhood\nharassment, sexual abuse, inability to relate to women, and the death\nof his older brother. Defendant attended over 100 sessions with\nWiller between 1991 and 1995. According to Moses, defendant\nstopped attending sessions when the Veteran’s Administration\nchanged its billing practices and he “didn’t feel like he could afford\nthe copayment.”\n     The defense’s next witness was Roger Cowan, former warden of\nMenard Correctional Center. Defendant was incarcerated at Menard\nat the time of trial. Cowan explained that an inmate who serves a life\nsentence without the possibility of parole would always be housed in\na maximum security facility; an inmate on death row would be\nsegregated from the general population. Cowan described in detail\nthe tight security and highly restrictive conditions that apply to an\ninmate serving a natural life sentence. Cowan characterized\nincarceration at Menard as “a very rigid lifestyle *** very demanding\non the inmates *** a tough life.” He noted that Menard is not air-\nconditioned. Inmates can receive five visits per month, and they get\nfive hours of recreation each week.\n     Cowan noted that defendant had spent seven years in the\ncorrectional system. He had been ticketed only twice: once for\nthrowing his lunch tray from his cell onto the floor; once for failing\nto enter his cell on time. Cowan offered his assessment that defendant\nhad made a “very good adjustment” to prison life.\n     Dr. Stephen Hardy, a clinical psychologist who had worked\nseveral years for both the Department of Corrections and the\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\fDepartment of Mental Health/Human Services, testified that he had\nevaluated defendant on six occasions and had reviewed records\npertinent to defendant’s mental condition. Hardy diagnosed defendant\nwith Tourette’s disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and personality disorder with\navoidant and borderline features. Hardy based the PTSD diagnosis on\ndefendant’s “history of severe sexual and physical abuse involving\nan older sister and neighborhood bullies respectively.” Hardy\nexplained that a PTSD diagnosis based on childhood sexual abuse\ndoes not necessarily have to entail “an event where the person was\nthreatened or suffered serious injury. *** Sexually traumatic events\nmay include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences\nwithout threatened or actual violence or injury.”\n    Concerning the abduction and murder of Cassandra Corum,\nHardy concluded that defendant acted while “under the influence of\nan extreme mental or emotional disturbance but not such to constitute\na defense to the prosecution.” Hardy noted in defendant’s history a\n“clear pattern” involving “chronic feelings of emptiness and\ninappropriate anger and difficulty controlling this anger.”\n    Hardy recognized that defendant “had some difficulties getting\nalong with people, and there were some personal conflicts at work.”\nDefendant consistently displayed an unwillingness to be involved\nwith other people, particularly adult females. Notwithstanding\ndefendant’s “difficulties getting along with people,” Hardy testified\nthat defendant’s potential for acting out violently in prison was low,\nan assessment he based upon the structure of prison and the prison\nauthorities’ ability to quickly intervene should defendant become\nviolent. In that respect, Hardy concluded: “Looking at the\ncircumstances under which he acted out violently in the past,\nexamining the means he had to do so, the characteristics of his past\nvictims, and you combine that with his behavior the past seven years\nin two maximum security environments, I think the potential for him\nto act out violently it’s my opinion is very low.”\n    Hardy acknowledged that defendant would still come into contact\nwith women in prison. He also described an incident during which\ndefendant became very loud and threw some papers while Hardy was\ninterviewing him. Although Hardy did not call the guards, Hardy was\nnonetheless “concerned about it.”\n\n\n                                -37-\n\f     Dr. James Merikangas reiterated much of his testimony from the\nbench trial/GBMI hearing. Commenting on the MRI and the single\nphoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan evidence,\nwhich suggested shrinkage of defendant’s brain, Merikangas\nobserved that such findings were often associated with dementia, loss\nof intellectual capacity, and abnormalities of motor control.\nMerikangas did not believe that defendant’s criminal conduct could\nbe explained simply in terms of inability to control his anger.\nMerikangas concluded: “I would call it rage attacks, I would call it\nimpulse disorder, intermittent explosive disorder. I wouldn’t simply\ncall it anger.” Merikangas stated his belief that antiseizure medication\ncould prevent defendant’s violent outbursts and antipsychotic\nmedication could be used to treat “the disorder of thinking that he\nhas.”\n     Under cross-examination, Merikangas maintained that\ndefendant’s brain “shrinkage” and, inferentially, his “reduced mental\ncapacity[,] *** probably did have something to do with the murders.”\nMerikangas rejected the prosecutor’s suggestion that defendant’s\nactions during the murders showed he had no “coordination\nproblems,” and that he had displayed an “ability to plan,” and select\nas victims women whom he could manipulate, control, and ultimately\nkill. Merikangas insisted that defendant’s actions showed “an\ninability to communicate with women in a normal manner.” When\nthe prosecutor stated that defendant “never had enough guts to do it\nto a man, *** he always had to pick out a woman,” Merikangas\nbrought up “the outburst that he had here in the courtroom, when the\njury wasn’t present, where he turned over the table and went wild\nwith even these guards standing next to him.” Merikangas pointed to\nthat incident as an indication that defendant suffers from a “real loss\nof control.” Inquiring further about defendant’s spontaneous loss of\ncontrol, his impulse disorder, and his intermittent explosive disorder,\nthe following colloquy ensued between the prosecutor and\nMerikangas:\n              “PROSECUTOR: You think carrying around knives and\n          a machete in a rental car in California when he picked up\n          [J.A.], you think that showed a disorder of thought or did it\n          show planning?\n\n\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\f              MERIKANGAS: That shows that he was looking for\n         something but also indicates a certain paranoia to be carrying\n         all those weapons.”\n     The final defense witness was Dr. Terry Killian. Killian testified\nconsistently with his testimony from the bench trial/GBMI hearing,\nfocusing again on the defendant’s mental state and dissociation at the\ntime of Corum’s murder. Killian emphasized, however, that the\ndefendant accepted responsibility for his conduct and did not blame\nit on an alter ego. Killian also believed that defendant’s voluntary\ncounseling sessions with Dr. Willer represented “a good-faith effort”\nto obtain treatment “within the limitations of what I believe he is\ncapable of doing.”\n     Killian’s testimony about defendant’s diagnosis, background,\nfamily history, childhood trauma, and history of mental health\ntreatment was also consistent with his testimony from the bench\ntrial/GBMI hearing. Killian noted that he had reviewed medical\nrecords, arrest reports, and police records, and had conducted over 22\nhours of interviews. Summarizing his findings, Killian explained that\ndefendant was not insane and was responsible for his actions;\nhowever, Killian concluded that defendant suffered from extreme\nmental and emotional disturbances that reduced his mental capacity\nat the time of his offenses. Killian believed that defendant felt some\nremorse for his actions, but, even though it would have been to his\nadvantage to express remorse in death penalty proceedings, defendant\nfeared that expressing remorse would be perceived as self-serving\nand insincere.\n     On cross-examination, Killian testified that he had “reviewed” a\nsentence-completion test administered by Dr. Opsahl when forming\nhis opinion. When the prosecutor handed Killian the sentence-\ncompletion test, and asked if that was the test he had reviewed,\ndefense counsel objected, arguing that the test was not relevant unless\nKillian had relied upon the test in formulating his opinion. The\nprosecutor was then allowed to question Killian as to whether he had\nrelied on the report when forming his opinion. Killian responded:\n              “A. I looked at this, but I didn’t include this, I’m pretty\n         sure I did not include a description of this in my report. I read\n         through it and didn’t see anything that, that was significantly\n         different from what I already knew about him; so I didn’t\n         include the specifics of it.\n\n                                  -39-\n\f            Q. Did you rely upon, at all, in any respect, rely upon, for\n        your opinions here and your assessment of Mr. Urdiales’s\n        personality, did you rely upon any of his answers here?\n            A. I don’t think I did. I don’t think I put much into the\n        sentence completion test. I remember looking at it but not\n        making much of it and setting it aside, and I don’t think I\n        relied on that. I relied on lots of other things but not that test\n        specifically.\n            ***\n            Q. So you don’t recall if some of the answers that he gave\n        on this two-page test helped you formulate that he had this\n        rage towards women?\n            A. I don’t specifically recall. I’d be happy to look at it if\n        you’d like.”\nAfter looking at the report, Killian stated:\n        “Well, they’re consistent with what I already believed about\n        him from everything else I had read. In other words, he does\n        make comments in here about women that are pretty negative.\n        That should hardly be surprising given everything else about\n        him.”\nWhen the prosecutor asked for specifics, defense counsel objected\nand asked to approach the bench. The court announced a brief recess\nand made the following comments out of the presence of the jury:\n        “To cut to the core, the witness is not being responsive, and\n        the right question I don’t believe has been answered. The\n        witness has testified very clearly to the tune of $36,000 that\n        he has gone over with great care all of the materials of a\n        psychiatric nature. The witness has acknowledged that this is\n        among the materials. Now, what the witness has said here, is\n        he has not included it in his report because it is consistent\n        with what he already knew. He has not yet testified that he\n        disregarded it and did not rely on it, but yet he has skirted the\n        issue and not testified that he discarded it and didn’t take it\n        into account in arriving at his decisions. I think we need a\n        vigorous interrogation on foundation by the State to see\n        where this witness goes because he’s going in both\n        directions.”\n\n\n                                  -40-\n\f    In subsequent foundational questioning, out of the presence of the\njury, Killian conceded that he had taken into account all the materials\nplaced before him, and then qualified his answer by adding, “[I]t’s\nnot accurate to say that each piece of paper received the same amount\nof attention as any other piece of paper.” The prosecutor then asked\nif defendant’s answers in the sentence-completion test were\nimportant in his analysis of defendant. Killian responded: “I’m\nanswering this as well as I can.”\n    At that point the court asked Killian if he understood the question,\nand directed him to answer it if he understood. The court advised\nKillian, if he did not understand, he should say so. At the court’s\ndirection, the prosecutor’s question was read back, and Killian\nresponded that he considered defendant’s answers in the sentence-\ncompletion test “somewhat important.” The prosecutor then returned\nto the critical question: “Did you take his answers to these questions\ninto account in arriving at your conclusion?” Killian answered: “Not\nspecifically, I did not include them in my report.” As the prosecutor\nbegan to protest, the court again interceded:\n        “All right. Once again, let me stop you here. Sir, there was a\n        question asked you and you answered a different question.\n        I’m going to have the court reporter read back the question\n        once again. *** I want you to listen to the question that’s\n        asked of you and then I want you to answer that question\n        unless you don’t understand it. Do we understand each\n        other?”\nKillian answered affirmatively. When the question was read back by\nthe court reporter, Killian finally answered, unequivocally: “Yes, I\ntook them into account.” With that, the court determined there was\na sufficient foundation to go into the report before the jury. Before\nthe jury was called back into the courtroom, the court asked attorney\nElmore if there was anything he wanted to contest in terms of that\nruling. Defense counsel responded: “It’s proper, I agree. He took it\ninto account; so, it’s fair game.”\n    Before the jury, Killian again acknowledged that defendant’s\nanswers in the sentence-completion test were considered in his\nassessment of defendant, and defendant’s answers were consistent\nwith defendant’s attitudes toward, and feelings about, women.\nAlthough, at trial, the prosecutor then read aloud the open-ended\nportions of the sentences in the test, and Killian responded by\n\n                                 -41-\n\fsupplying the words defendant used to complete the sentences, we set\nforth here the completed sentences, utilizing hyphens to separate the\ntest portions from defendant’s responses:\n            “Sentence # 2: A wife should–be a good provider.\n            Sentence # 4: A man feels good when–he comes.\n            Sentence # 7: Men are lucky because–we have cocks.\n            Sentence # 8: I just can’t stand people who–get in my\n        face.\n            Sentence # 11: A woman feels good when–we stick it in\n        them.\n            Sentence # 12: My main problem is–people.\n            Sentence # 13: A husband has the right to–beat his wife.\n            Sentence # 14: A woman should always–please her man.\n            Sentence # 19: If I can’t get what I want–I take it.\n            Sentence # 22: My conscience bothers me–if I let it.\n            Sentence # 23: A man should always–be right.\n            Sentence # 25: When I am criticized–I get mad.\n            Sentence # 27: Being with other people–sucks.\n            Sentence # 30: What gets me into trouble is–sex.\n            Sentence # 35: A woman has a right to–be silent.”\nAfter going through the foregoing portions of the sentence-\ncompletion test, the prosecutor asked: “Hates women, doesn’t he?”\nKillian agreed, adding that defendant had “a great deal of anger, and\nmost of that anger is directed at women.”\n     The prosecutor followed up by asking about the sexual abuse that\ndefendant reported involving his sister, Monica. Killian\nacknowledged, on page 73 of his report, he wrote: “There were\napparently only a few incidents of sexual activity between them, and\nAndrew told me that he did not experience the sexual contact with\nMonica as traumatic and he did not even think of it as being wrong\nuntil he was well into his adult years.” Killian, however, disagreed\nwith the prosecutor’s assertion that there “wasn’t any sexual trauma,”\nsuggesting that “it was more traumatic than he currently admits to for\nwhatever reasons.” At the conclusion of Killian’s testimony, outside\nthe presence of the jury, the court ruled that the sentence-completion\ntest would be included in the record, but would not go to the jury.\n\n                                -42-\n\f    After Killian’s testimony, the defense rested. Defendant elected\nnot to testify in his own behalf or deliver a statement in allocution.\n    In rebuttal, the State called Dr. Park Dietz, who testified\nconsistently with his testimony at the bench trial/GBMI hearing.\nPrior to the defense’s stipulation that Dietz was qualified as an expert\n“in the area of forensic psychiatry,” the State elicited testimony that\nDietz had been previously involved in examinations of various high-\nprofile individuals such as John Hinckley, Jeffery Dahmer, and Ted\nKaczynski, also known as the Unibomber. After the defense\nstipulation, Dietz testified to his finding that defendant shows clear\nsigns of a personality disorder with antisocial and schizotypal\nfeatures. Dietz defined a personality disorder as “a lifelong pattern of\nmaladaptive behavior” that “tends to cause impairment” in a person’s\n“relationships with other people.”\n    Dietz believed that three factors may have played a part–to a\ngreater or lesser extent–in defendant’s development of a personality\ndisorder. First and foremost, Dietz felt that the taunting and bullying\ndefendant experienced as a child was a significant factor. Dietz noted\nthat defendant had been “taunted and bullied and teased” as a child,\nand he “blamed his crimes to some extent o[n] what people had done\nto him as a kid because it made him so angry and resentful.” Second,\nDietz believed that the death of defendant’s brother may have\ncontributed to the development of his disorder. Although defendant\ndid not remember his brother, and he did not feel impacted by his\nbrother’s death directly, there was evidence that defendant’s mother\nbecame withdrawn after Alfred’s death, and was “no longer as\nattentive and participatory as a caretaker.” Finally, Dietz mentioned\nthe defendant’s report of sexual intercourse with his sister as a\npossible factor; however, Dietz noted that defendant was not\n“particularly pleased or upset by it. He did not regard this as a very\nimportant aspect of what had happened to him as a child.” Dietz did\nnot believe it was “a particular[ly] traumatic event” for defendant. He\nplaced more importance on the “unavailability” of defendant’s\nmother after his brother’s death.\n    Dietz believed that anger played an important part in all of the\ncrimes committed by defendant, and in his work-related problems as\nwell. Dietz also testified that hatred of women and sexual sadism\nwere significant factors in the commission of defendant’s crimes.\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\f     Under cross-examination, Dietz stated that he normally uses the\nterms “mental illness” or “mental disease” to describe conditions “in\nwhich the person’s experience is categorically different from normal\nhuman experience.” Using the terms in that manner would equate the\nterms to psychosis, and they would thus apply to persons with\n“hallucinations, delusions, or a formal thought disorder.” Dietz\nacknowledged Illinois’ definition of mental illness for purposes of a\nfinding of guilty but mentally ill, and he paraphrased that definition\nfor the jury, i.e., “a substantial disorder of mood, thinking or behavior\nthat impaired judgment at the time of the crime.” Dietz concluded\nthat defendant was not mentally ill when he killed Cassandra Corum.\n     Following Dietz’s testimony, Cassandra Corum’s mother, Sherry\nAlsalah, read a victim impact statement, touching upon the effect\nCorum’s disappearance and murder had had upon her, the victim’s\nsister, and the victim’s young son.\n     Prior to closing argument, the prosecutor sought clarification of\nthe limits of permissible argument, inquiring as to which of the\ncourt’s rulings from the guilt phase would be the subject of proper\ncomment. The prosecutor noted he had “planned on arguing that the\nCourt has previously found the defendant to be sane, not to be\nmentally ill.” The court told the prosecutor: “No. You got to stay\naway from mental illness.” The prosecutor accepted that prohibition\nwithout objection or argument, stating, “That is what I wanted to be\nsure about.” Defense counsel then interjected, “Insanity is fair game.”\nThe court confirmed that insanity was “fair game,” and the parties\ncould discuss that finding, because the court had already advised the\njury of that ruling.\n     In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jurors:\n         “You’re not here to decide the Defendant’s guilt. That has\n         already been decided. The Court decided, Judge Frobish has\n         already decided that the Defendant is guilty of the murder of\n         Cassandra Corum. He also has decided that the Defendant\n         was not, at the time that murder was committed, insane.”\nThe prosecutor subsequently acknowledged that defendant’s mental\ncondition was relevant in the jury’s sentencing decision, noting that\nthe jury would receive instructions pertaining to “extreme mental or\nemotional disturbance” and “reduced mental capacity.”\n\n\n\n                                  -44-\n\f     In his closing statement, defense counsel summarized the\nevidence presented on defendant’s behalf, and took issue with the\nState’s evidence, particularly the testimony of Dr. Dietz. The focal\npoint of the defendant’s closing argument was the defendant’s mental\nand emotional condition. Defense counsel informed the jury it was “a\nfactor in mitigation” that defendant “suffers from a reduced mental\ncapacity.” He suggested there was “[a]bundant testimony concerning\nthat.” Counsel noted it was a mitigating factor that “the murder of\nCassandra Corum was committed while Defendant was under the\ninfluence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance although not\nsuch as to constitute a defense to the prosecution.” Counsel stated he\nhad asked Dr. Dietz to provide a “definition of mental illness,”\nhowever he provided the “definition of insanity.” Attorney Skelton\nunderscored: “As Judge Frobish has told you, insanity is not an issue\nat this stage of the proceeding.” Counsel emphasized that insanity\nwas not at issue and that Dr. Dietz had provided the “wrong\ndefinition of what we’re dealing with at this stage of the case.”\nSkelton observed that the jury had seen photographs evincing the\n“handiwork” of a “sick mind.” He directed the jury to “look at the\nmitigating factors,” noting that defendant “suffers from a mental\nillness” and “had a reduces mental capacity.” Counsel concluded:\n         “What we are talking about here is mitigation. What we are\n         talking about here is does society, do we as a people who do\n         not have the same deficits, the same problems, the same\n         illnesses as Andrew Urdialles, punish the mentally ill in the\n         same fashion that we would punish someone who does not\n         have that mental illness?”\nCounsel suggested that life in prison was the appropriate sentence.\n     In rebuttal argument, the prosecutor reiterated that insanity was\nnot an issue; however, he immediately followed that remark with a\nquestion that unequivocally apprised the jury that mental illness was\nstill an issue: “Is [defendant] mentally ill at some level?” What\nfollowed was a discussion of the evidence and testimony bearing\nupon that issue. The prosecutor’s subsequent remarks also made clear\nthat defendant’s mental state was considered a viable, and perhaps\ndeterminative, factor in the jury’s sentencing decision. We quote\npertinent portions of the prosecutor’s argument:\n         “Extreme mental or emotional disturbance or reduced mental\n         capacity. That’s what you are going to see [in instructions]\n\n                                -45-\n\f        when you decide whether or not you believe that factor in\n        mitigation and because of that its inappropriate to impose a\n        death penalty.\n             ***\n             Reduced mental capacity. *** I pose to you, think about\n        this. *** If this defendant were suffering from such an\n        extreme emotional disturbance and reduced mental capacity,\n        if a cop was at his elbow during all these crimes, he’d still do\n        them because he couldn’t help himself because he’s suffering\n        from those types of mental problems.\n             Does one of you think that if there was a policeman at his\n        elbow when [J.A.] was in that trunk she would have still been\n        in the trunk and that he would have done that? Do you think\n        if a policeman would have been at his elbow that he would\n        have blown the back of Denise Maney’s head off? Do any of\n        you really think that that if there would have been a cop there\n        with him, I’m just emotionally disturbed, I can’t help myself,\n        and he’d do it anyway? Is there a single person that can truly\n        believe that?”\nThe prosecutor noted, even if the jurors believed that defendant was\n“emotionally disturbed” or his “mental capacity was reduced,” they\ncould still “vote to impose the death penalty despite that.”\n    Following the arguments of the parties, the trial court issued final\ninstructions to the jury. The jury was instructed that mitigating\nfactors include:\n             “First: Any or all of the following if supported by the\n        evidence:\n             The murder was committed while the defendant was\n        under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional\n        disturbance, although not such as to constitute a defense to\n        the prosecution.\n             The defendant suffers from a reduced mental capacity.\n             Second: Any other reason supported by the evidence why\n        the defendant should not be sentenced to death.\n             Where there is evidence of a mitigating factor, the fact\n        that such mitigating factor is not a factor specifically listed in\n\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\f        these instructions does not preclude your consideration of the\n        evidence.”\n    During jury deliberations, the jury sent a note asking to see the\nsentence-completion test. The court initially considered whether to\nsend only the portion of the test referred to in the questioning of Dr.\nKillian. The court then inquired, “Should they get the questions that\nwere not asked of Dr. Killian?” Attorney Skelton responded for the\ndefense, “I need to review the entirety of the exhibit before I can\ncomment on that.” After further consideration, attorney Shelton\nstated: “I would suggest that it be sent in its entirety.” Attorney\nElmore concurred. By agreement of the parties, the entire sentence-\ncompletion test was sent to the jury.\n    The jury ultimately determined that death was the appropriate\nsentence. Subsequently, defendant filed a posttrial motion, which was\nconsidered and denied. The court sentenced defendant to death, and\nthis appeal followed.\n\n                              ANALYSIS\n                         Pretrial Proceedings\n              I. Shackling and Other Security Measures\n    Defendant first contends that he was deprived of due process and\nfundamental fairness where the trial court initially ordered\ndefendant’s legs shackled under a skirted table during courtroom\nappearances and later, after defendant created a disturbance in the\ncourtroom, ordered his left arm shackled under the table as well.\nDefendant also argues that he was improperly denied writing utensils\nafter the courtroom disturbance and, in the issue statement of his\nbrief, suggests that the court erred in “instruct[ing] the jury that the\ndefendant was restrained for security reasons.”\n    In response to defendant’s contentions, the State first argues that\ndefendant acquiesced in the trial court’s ordering of restraints and\nforfeited the issue by failing to object at trial or preserve the issue in\na posttrial motion. Beyond that, the State contends that defendant\ncannot obtain relief under the plain error doctrine because there was\nno error.\n    In addressing defendant’s plain error argument, we first “consider\nwhether error occurred at all.” People v.

Consequently, a trial court\nmust–outside the presence of the jury–place its reasons for shackling\na defendant on the record and provide defense counsel with an\nopportunity to offer reasons why the defendant should not be\nshackled. Buss, 187 Ill. 2d at 216. As this court observed in Buss, a\n\n                                  -48-\n\fsingle reason for shackling has generally been held to be insufficient\njustification for the restraint; whereas, “Illinois courts have found no\nabuse of discretion in shackling a defendant when the circuit court\nhas expressed more than a single reason for shackling a defendant.”\nBuss, 187 Ill. 2d at 216-17 (compiling cases).\n     Perhaps because the trial judge in this case had been subject to\nappellate court criticism in a previous matter, he was particularly\nsensitive to the Boose issue, and he took care to comply with the\nmandated procedure. The court first noted that defendant’s legs\nwould be shackled under a skirted table and that the jurors would not\nbe aware of it unless defendant drew their attention to it. The judge\nasked defense counsel if they had “any objection on the record.”\nCounsel responded that the defense had “no objection to it now.” The\ntrial court then specifically identified three factors to support its\ndecision to shackle defendant’s legs. First, the court observed that\ndefendant had been recently convicted of two murders in Cook\nCounty and had been sentenced to death. Although his death sentence\nwas subsequently commuted, he was, at the time of trial, still serving\ntwo life sentences. Second, the court mentioned defendant’s physical\nattributes, noting that he was in good health and had no difficulty\ngetting around. Third, the court made reference to the age of the\nLivingston County courthouse and stated there were “all kind of\nsecurity problems with the building and the courtroom.” Although the\ncourt did not initially mention the first Boose factor, i.e., the\nseriousness of the charge against defendant, that consideration must\nhave been obvious to all, and the court’s subsequent reference to that\nfactor indicates that it no doubt was significant in the court’s ruling\nat the outset. After the court set forth its reasons for the restraint, the\njudge stated his intention to instruct the jury that “security measures\nhave been taken, such as the guards being here.” With those\ncomments on the restraint of defendant and attendant security\nmeasures, the trial court again asked: “Is there anything else on that\nissue that either the State or the defense wishes to bring up?” For the\ndefense, attorney Skelton responded, “No, sir.”\n     The court then recessed prior to the commencement of jury voir\ndire. During that recess, defendant began cursing and threw a cup of\nwater because a guard, and his own attorney, had instructed him that\nhe could not speak with his parents and Kendra Moses. Defendant\nhad to be physically subdued and handcuffed, and he turned over a\n\n                                   -49-\n\ftable in the process. After the trial judge ascertained what had\nhappened, the court asked defendant: “Will you promise to behave\nyourself if I do not shackle you?” Defendant gave no explicit\nassurances, stating only, through counsel, that he had not been\nshackled in the prior Cook County proceedings, and there had been\nno outbursts or problems. The court then made the additional\nobservation: “[Y]ou are on trial here for your life.” As a result of the\noutburst, the court ordered defendant’s left arm shackled under the\ntable as well and directed that defendant be given no pencils or pens.\n     Two days later, in chambers, the court revisited the issue of\nsecurity. The court observed that two “very large guards” had been\nnecessary to restrain defendant “notwithstanding that he was already\nshackled to an eye bolt on the floor.” The judge described\ndefendant’s conduct and characterized it as going “ballistic” or\n“berserk.” Attorney Elmore, for the defense, acknowledged that the\ncourt had not overstated the severity of the incident. The court then\nstated that defendant was a “high risk individual” and noted that his\ndemeanor had changed after it became clear that the trial was\n“actually going to go forward finally.” The judge stated his belief that\ndefendant was a “desperate man.” With those additional observations,\nbearing upon the second and sixth factors mentioned in Boose (see\nBoose, 66 Ill. 2d at 266-67 (“ ‘defendant’s temperament and\ncharacter’ ” and “ ‘threats to harm others or cause a disturbance’ ”),\nquoting State v. Tolley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1354336\"><a href=\"/opinion/1354336/state-v-tolley/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1354336\"><a href=\"/opinion/1354336/state-v-tolley/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368\n(1976)), the court again asked defense counsel: “[D]o you want me\nto free up Mr. Urdiales more than I am contemplating doing?”\nAttorney Skelton initially responded by asking that the court\nreconsider its decision to deny defendant a writing implement. The\ncourt then stated: “DOC has had in the past inch pencils. *** It’s a\nvery small pencil. We’ll explore that and come up with a writing\nmaterial that couldn’t do you harm.” Other than that single request,\ndefense counsel did not object to the security measures ordered by\nthe court, and in fact concluded his remarks on the subject by\nimplicitly agreeing that the court’s measures were appropriate under\nthe circumstances, stating, “I know what the court’s talking about.\nI’ve been there.”\n     We find that the trial court set forth more of record than was\nnecessary to justify the physical restraints and security measures it\nutilized. The court gave the defense an opportunity to offer reasons\n\n                                 -50-\n\fwhy defendant should not be shackled, and the defense in effect\nconceded that the court’s actions were appropriate. The use of\nphysical restraints, which were not visible to the jury, did not impair\ndefendant’s ability to communicate with counsel and assist in his\ndefense. In short, we find that the court acted appropriately, and did\nnot abuse its discretion in this regard.\n     Although we believe the court would have been justified in\ndenying defendant writing implements, and such a deprivation would\nnot have affected his ability to communicate with counsel–who was\nsitting right next to defendant–the record does not support\ndefendant’s contention that the court actually denied defendant the\nmeans to write. There is no indication in the record that the court did\nnot, ultimately, “come up with a writing material that couldn’t do\n[defense counsel] harm.” We note that an appellant has the burden of\npresenting the court with an adequate record regarding a claimed\nerror, and any doubts arising from an inadequate record will be\nresolved against him.

The court did not tell jurors that defendant was\n“restrained.” Rather, the court advised jurors that defendant was “in\ncustody” and “certain security measures” had been taken. While that\nadmonishment might have been the basis for an argument in and of\nitself, defendant’s brief includes no argument or citation of authority\nbearing upon either the trial court’s actual statement to the jury or the\nstatement as he misrepresents it.

Remarks Regarding Appellate Court Opinions\n    Defendant next contends that he was “deprived of due process\nand fundamental fairness where the [trial] judge disparaged various\njustices of the Illinois appellate court, expressed contempt for recent\nappellate opinions restricting a trial court’s authority to shackle or\nrestrain defendants, and indicated he would mail a transcript\nregarding the defendant’s single courtroom disruption to appellate\nand supreme court justices who potentially would review this case on\nappeal.” Defendant cites this court’s decision in In re Dominique F.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2172084\"><a href=\"/opinion/2172084/in-re-dominique-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), for the proposition that “[i]t is unacceptable\nfor a trial judge to disregard *** precedent because he disagrees with\nit.” We find that the trial judge in this case registered his\ndisagreement with precedent, but he did not disregard it.\n    As previously noted, perhaps because the trial judge in this case\nhad been subject to appellate court criticism in a previous matter, he\nwas particularly sensitive to the Boose issue, and he took care to\ncomply with the mandated procedure. The trial court set forth more\nof record than was necessary to justify the physical restraints and\nsecurity measures it utilized. Thus, defendant was not denied due\nprocess or fundamental fairness by the court’s comments, all of\nwhich were made outside the presence of the jury.\n    We do not, however, mean to encourage the kind of rambling,\namorphous diatribe in which the trial court engaged. While restrained\nand reasoned disagreement with the ruling of a superior court is not\nto be discouraged, and may well be constructive in a proper setting,\nas our appellate court has observed, dignity is necessary for judicial\nproceedings. See People v. Thurmond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2034452\"><a href=\"/opinion/2034452/people-v-thurmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

As the appellate court noted in Thurmond, a trial judge\nshould be the exemplar of dignity, he should exercise restraint over\nhis conduct and utterances, and should control his emotions.\nThurmond, 317 Ill. App. 3d at 1145. We trust that the judge in this\ncase will, in the future, circumscribe his conduct and comments so as\nto reflect the dignity his office, in particular, and that of the judicial\nsystem, of which he is but one part.\n\n               III. Involvement of DPTA Attorneys\n   Defendant next contends that he was deprived of due process and\nfundamental fairness because the trial court “disparaged the motives\n\n                                  -52-\n\fand conduct of attorneys for the State Appellate Defender Death\nPenalty Trial Assistance Unit, who were an integral part of the\ndefense team representing Andrew Urdiales.” Defendant states that\nthe trial court’s “expressed animosity” may indicate that the judge\nwas not “impartial.” Defendant also argues: “Once [the trial judge]\nappointed the Appellate Defender and Mr. Richards, the trial judge\nhad no authority to preclude Mr. Richards from assigning his\nassistants to the case, or to strike Mr. Hanlon and Mr. Sincox from\nthe entry of appearance.” Moreover, defendant submits that the court\nexcluded Sincox because the court “objected to his demeanor” and\nthe court had “no inherent authority to discipline” Sincox in that\nmanner. We begin this portion of our analysis with a review of the\npertinent statutes.\n     Section 10 of the State Appellate Defender Act prescribes the\npowers and duties of the State Appellate Defender (725 ILCS 105/10\n(West 2004)), and applies to all attorneys employed by the Office of\nthe State Appellate Defender (OSAD) (725 ILCS 105/2 (2) (West\n2004)). The Act governs the circumstances under which the State\nAppellate Defender may be appointed to represent defendants in any\ngiven case (Kirwan v. Welch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230632\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230632/kirwan-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164-65 (1989)), and the\nattorneys of that agency may represent defendants “only as the Act\nprovides.” (Emphasis in original.)

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 647\n(2004).\n     The State points out that the version of the State Appellate\nDefender Act in effect at the time of defendant’s trial did not\n“mandate” that an attorney from OSAD be allowed to file his or her\nappearance as trial counsel in a death penalty case and participate in\nthat capacity. Our reading of the statute in question indicates that it\ndid not even authorize OSAD attorneys to act as trial counsel in\ncapital cases, much less “mandate” that they be allowed to do so. See\n725 ILCS 105/10(a), (b)(5) (West 2004) (“The State Appellate\nDefender shall represent indigent persons on appeal *** when\nappointed to do so by a court under a Supreme Court Rule or law of\nthis State. *** The Office of the State Appellate Defender shall not\nbe appointed to serve as trial counsel in capital cases”). In fact, a\nliteral reading of the pertinent statute indicates it did not even\nauthorize the assistance of attorneys from OSAD. Section 10(c)(5)\nof the applicable version of the Act stated in relevant part:\n\n                                 -53-\n\f            “(c) The State Appellate Defender may:\n                 (5) in cases in which a death sentence is an authorized\n            disposition, provide trial counsel with the assistance of\n            expert witnesses, investigators, and mitigation specialists\n            from funds appropriated to the State Appellate Defender\n            specifically for that purpose by the General Assembly.\n            The Office of State Appellate Defender shall not be\n            appointed to serve as trial counsel in capital cases.”\n            (Emphasis added.) 725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West 2004).\nUnder a literal reading of the provision, the statute allowed the State\nAppellate Defender to provide only “the assistance of expert\nwitnesses, investigators, and mitigation specialists.”\n     Of course, with the passage of Public Act 94–340, effective\nJanuary 1, 2006, the State Appellate Defender Act was amended to\nspecifically allow the State Appellate Defender to provide trial\ncounsel in capital cases with “legal advice,” in addition to the\nservices previously authorized (725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West Supp.\n2005)), and the Capital Crimes Litigation Act was amended to\nprovide as follows: “At the request of court appointed counsel [in\ncapital cases], attorneys employed by the State Appellate Defender\nmay enter an appearance for the limited purpose of assisting counsel\nappointed under this Section.” 725 ILCS 124/5 (West Supp. 2005).\n     Although the amended versions of the State Appellate Defender\nAct and the Capital Crimes Litigation Act were not in effect at the\ntime of his trial, defendant simply proceeds in his argument as if they\nwere. He does not argue that those provisions apply retroactively; he\ndoes not advance reasons why they should apply retroactively; and\nhe cites no relevant authority in that regard. Thus, defendant has\nforfeited any contention that the amended provisions apply. See\nPeople v. Mertz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2099747\"><a href=\"/opinion/2099747/people-v-mertz/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (2005) (defendant’s failure to offer\nanalysis and cite legal authority in support of retroactive application\nresulted in forfeiture of the issue). We thus examine defendant’s\ncontentions utilizing the statutes in effect at the time of defendant’s\ntrial–the provisions presumably known to the presiding trial judge.\n     Those provisions did not, by their terms, authorize OSAD\nattorneys to serve as counsel in capital cases or provide legal advice\nto the attorneys actually serving as trial counsel. If they did, it would\nhardly seem necessary to amend section 10(c)(5) of the State\n\n\n                                  -54-\n\fAppellate Defender Act to specifically so state, and that is exactly\nwhat Public Act 94–340 did. See 725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West Supp.\n2005) (adding the phrase “legal advice”). The version of the Act in\neffect at the time of trial, and the current version, both state that the\n“State Appellate Defender shall not be appointed to serve as trial\ncounsel in capital cases.” Compare 725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West\n2004) with 725 ILCS 105/10(c)(5) (West Supp. 2005). That provision\nis at once a prohibition directed to circuit courts and to the attorneys\nof OSAD. Trial courts are not to appoint attorneys of that agency to\nserve as trial counsel in capital cases, and attorneys of that agency are\nnot statutorily authorized to serve in that capacity. The State\nAppellate Defender Act governs the circumstances in which the\nattorneys of that state agency are authorized to render their state-\nsupported services. They are not free agents who can act as counsel\nwhen and where they see fit.\n     That is not to say that the unauthorized actions of an OSAD\nattorney on behalf of a criminal defendant are a nullity. After all, the\nattorney who chooses to exceed his statutory authorization, and is\nallowed to do so by a trial court, is nonetheless a licensed attorney,\nand his actions will be judged by the standards applicable to any\nlicensed attorney acting in that context. However, such an attorney\nhas no right to interject himself, or herself, into the trial.\n     Applying those principles to this case, it is clear that the trial\ncourt was not required to allow OSAD attorneys to participate as\n“part of the defense team.” In fact, the court should not have allowed\nRichards to participate. Defendant was fortunate to receive the able\nservices of Richards, but he was not statutorily entitled to them.\n     Because Sincox and Hanlon were not statutorily authorized to\nparticipate as defendant’s attorneys in this case, and the trial judge\nwas not required to allow them to do so, the judge did not err in\nstriking their names from the entry of appearance filed by Richards.\nFor the same reasons–and irrespective of the concerns actually\nexpressed by the court–there would have been no error in precluding\nSincox from participating in the deposition of Dietz.\n     However, the record indicates the court never denied defendant’s\nmotion for Sincox to participate in that deposition. Defendant’s trial\nattorney, Elmore, appeared to agree with the court’s statement that\nthe defense motion was moot because Elmore and Skelton planned\nto travel to California for the deposition, and, in any event, defense\n\n                                  -55-\n\fcounsel never obtained a ruling on the motion.

We note that\nthe court’s remarks regarding the attorneys who actually represented\nthe defendant were highly complimentary, and there was no hint of\nanimosity or disparagement therein. None of the court’s comments\nto or about the attorneys were made in the presence of the jury.\n     We are compelled to comment on one remark the court made\nabout attorneys Richards and Sincox. At one point, during a\ndiscussion of the contemplated deposition of Dr. Dietz in California,\nthe trial court expressed concern that attorneys Sincox and Richards\nhad “an agenda far greater than” the defendant’s case. Later, in that\nsame discussion, the trial judge specified the nature of his concern,\nfocusing on attorney Sincox. Referring specifically to Sincox, whose\npossible participation in the anticipated deposition had been broached\nby attorney Skelton, the court stated:\n         “His conduct in this courtroom was most unprofessional. It is\n         clear to me that he has an agenda far greater than Mr.\n         Urdiales and he is motivated by that. And I am concerned that\n         his conduct will be governed by that. *** And if he goes far\n         afield out there, we have got a mess on our hands in terms of,\n         well, now the deposition wasn’t completed.”\n     Clearly, although the court included attorney Richards in his\ninitial remark, the comment was prompted by the suggestion that\nSincox participate in the deposition of Dietz. We note that attorney\nRichards was otherwise treated with respect and consideration by the\ncourt in all of the pretrial proceedings in which he participated. We\nsee no evidence of prejudice with respect to him. With respect to\nSincox, the record suggests that the court may have had good reason\nto mistrust him and question his professionalism.\n     In any event, placed in context, the judge’s initial statement, and\nhis subsequent expansive comments, appear to reflect the court’s\njustifiable concern that the admittedly broader agenda of the DPTA\nmight result in questioning “far afield” in areas not particularly\n\n\n                                 -56-\n\fpertinent to defendant’s case, resulting in an unnecessary delay and\ndocketing problems. We believe those were valid considerations.\n    We note that allegations of judicial bias or prejudice must be\nviewed in context and should be evaluated in terms of the trial\njudge’s specific reaction to the events taking place.

The fact that a judge displays\ndispleasure or irritation with an attorney’s behavior is not necessarily\nevidence of judicial bias against the defendant or his counsel.\nJackson, 205 Ill. 2d at 277. As noted, the report of proceedings\nreveals nothing in the way of judicial displeasure or irritation with\nRichards. Since Sincox was not allowed to serve as counsel for\ndefendant, or represent him in any way, we need not consider the\npossible repercussions of the court’s interaction with Sincox. In short,\nthe court’s conduct with respect to the DPTA attorneys did not deny\ndefendant due process.\n\n                               Guilt Phase\n                      Guilty Plea and Bench Trial\n    Defendant next contends that the trial court abused its discretion\nin rejecting his plea of guilty but mentally ill, and, in a related claim,\nargues that the trial court’s bench trial verdict of guilty, “rather than\nguilty but mentally ill,” was against the manifest weight of the\nevidence. The relief defendant requests in each instance is “a new\nsentencing hearing.” Defendant suggests he is “entitled to a new\ncapital sentencing hearing because the trial court’s rejection of his\nGBMI plea tainted the weight and credibility of his mitigation\nevidence” at his sentencing hearing.

As is\nthe case when a defendant raises a defense of insanity, for which a\ndefendant also bears the burden of proof, the existence of “mental\nillness,” as defined in section 6–2, is a question of fact; thus, the trial\ncourt’s resolution of that issue will not be overturned unless it is\ncontrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. See Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2039751\"><a href=\"/opinion/2039751/people-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 128-29.\n     The Criminal Code also provides for a plea of guilty but mentally\nill. Section 115–2 of the Criminal Code governs pleas of guilty, as\nwell as pleas of guilty but mentally ill. Subsection (b) of section\n115–2 provides that a plea of guilty but mentally ill “may be\naccepted” by the court when, inter alia:\n             “(3) the judge has held a hearing, at which either party\n         may present evidence, on the issue of the defendant’s mental\n         health and, at the conclusion of such hearing, is satisfied that\n         there is a factual basis that the defendant was mentally ill at\n         the time of the offense to which the plea is entered.” 725\n         ILCS 5/115–2(b)(3) (West 2004).\n\n                                   -58-\n\f    Defendant initially argues that the trial court erred when it\nrejected his plea of guilty but mentally ill and, in doing so, “decided\nthat the legal standards for determining a factual basis for a\ntraditional plea *** were inapplicable to determining the factual basis\nfor pleas of guilty but mentally ill.” Citing this court’s decision in\nPeople v.

We agree with defendant as to the applicable\nstandard of review. However, we otherwise reject the substance of his\nargument.\n    Defendant notes that the language of subsection (b) of section\n115–2, i.e., “may be accepted,” substantially mirrors the language of\nsubsection (a), which addresses “the traditional guilty plea.” Ergo,\ndefendant argues that cases interpreting standards applicable to\nsubsection (a) should provide guidance as to the proper interpretation\nof subsection (b). Defendant conveniently overlooks a significant\ndifference between the procedures set forth in subsections (a) and (b).\nSubsection (b) appears to provide for a contested hearing “on the\nissue of defendant’s mental health,” a hearing “at which either party\nmay present evidence.” Notwithstanding this difference, defendant\nmaintains that proceedings on a plea of guilty but mentally ill should\nbe governed by the identical principles applicable to “the traditional\nguilty plea,” and cites this court’s decision in People v. Barker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2042702\"><a href=\"/opinion/2042702/people-v-barker/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 319, 328 (1980), for the following proposition:\n        “In evaluating the sufficiency of the factual basis to support\n        a plea of guilty, a trial judge is in much the same position and\n        would apply similar standards as those used in determining\n        the sufficiency of the State’s evidence at trial to withstand a\n        motion for a directed verdict of not guilty.”\nDefendant’s argument suggests that the trial court was obligated to\naccept his plea, and thus find he was “mentally ill” as defined in\nsection 6–2 of the Criminal Code, if defendant presented some\nevidence to support such a finding, irrespective of evidence to the\ncontrary presented by the State. Defendant’s position is untenable.\n    It would seem self-evident that a proceeding in which there are\nno contested issues may be subject to different standards than one in\nwhich a controversy exists. In this case, the State chose to dispute the\nexistence of “mental illness,” as defined in section 6–2 of the\nCriminal Code. Because there was a dispute regarding an element of\nthe guilty plea, this case does not present a “traditional guilty plea,”\n\n                                  -59-\n\fwe are not concerned with one party’s evidence alone, and the\nstandard for sufficiency referenced in the quoted passage from\nBarker cannot ultimately apply. Whether evidence could support a\nparticular finding or verdict (the inquiry upon a motion for directed\nverdict) is a different question from whether the evidence does in fact\nsupport that finding or verdict after a full evidentiary hearing. See\nPeople v. Connolly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2224398\"><a href=\"/opinion/2224398/people-v-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

In the latter\ninstance, the trier of fact necessarily weighs all the evidence and\npasses upon the credibility of witnesses in resolving disputed issues.\nConnelly, 322 Ill. App. 3d at 915. Because the State contested the\nexistence of mental illness, that is what the trial court was obligated\nto do in this case.\n     Acceptance of defendant’s argument would allow defendants who\nplead guilty but mentally ill to effectively evade the burden of proof\nthat the legislature has placed upon those who raise the issue at trial.\nThe legislature could not have intended such a result. As we have\nnoted, a defendant whose case is tried would have to establish, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that he or she is mentally ill, as\ndefined in subsections (c) and (d) of section 6–2. 725 ILCS\n5/115–3(c)(3), 115–4(j) (West 2004).

Thus, at trial, following the presentation\nof evidence by both the defendant and the State, a trial court would\nhave to determine whether it was “more likely than not” that\ndefendant suffered from a mental illness, as defined in the statute, at\nthe time he or she committed the offense. A defendant pleading guilty\nbut mentally ill should have the same burden of proof. He cannot\nabsolve himself of that burden by admitting an element he has the\nburden of proving. The directed verdict standard, mentioned in\nBarker, cannot apply to a contested proceeding, where evidence is\nadduced to controvert defendant’s claim of mental illness.\n     We also find meritless defendant’s claim that the trial court erred\nin rejecting his plea of guilty but mentally ill, and his contention that\nthe trial court’s verdict of guilty, as opposed to guilty but mentally ill,\nwas against the manifest weight of the evidence. As the foregoing\nanalysis indicates, defendant had the burden of proving his mental\nillness by a preponderance of the evidence. As our subsequent\n\n\n                                   -60-\n\fdiscussion will show, the court’s determination, that he did not\nsustain that burden, was not against the weight of the evidence.\n     As Illinois courts have noted, the credibility and weight to be\ngiven psychiatric testimony are matters for the trier of fact, who is\nnot obligated to accept the opinions of defendant’s expert witnesses\nover those opinions presented by the State.

In\nannouncing that ruling, the trial judge stated he found the testimony\nof Dr. Dietz “substantially more persuasive and more convincing than\nthat of the defense experts.” However, the court also found the facts\nof the case themselves a compelling refutation of testimony given by\nthe defense experts.\n     As previously noted, Dietz testified that defendant suffered\nprincipally from a personality disorder, and he displayed obvious\ncharacteristics of a sexual sadist. Dietz did not consider personality\nor anxiety disorders to be mental illnesses, as defined in section 6–2\nof the Criminal Code. He believed that defendant’s criminal behavior\nwas driven by sexual desire, anger, and “a kind of predatory desire\nfor conquest.” If defendant’s judgment was impaired, Dietz believed\nthose were the factors causing impairment, not mental illness. Dietz\nalso rejected Merikangas’ diagnosis of organic brain disease, noting\nthat defendant’s 2004 MRI was within the normal range, and\ndefendant’s actions at the time of Corum’s murder did not bespeak\nsomeone who suffered from significant impairment of the central\nnervous system. Dietz noted that the murder required\nplanning–defendant brought handcuffs, duct tape, a knife, and a gun\nwith him–a certain degree of physical prowess and\ncoordination–defendant was able to overpower Corum, drive her 100\nmiles, murder her, and carry her body to a bridge, where he threw her\ninto the river–and rational thought–insofar as defendant decided to\n\n\n                                 -61-\n\fdrive Corum to a secluded location, where he could kill her without\nbeing observed.\n     The trial court observed that the principal defense witnesses\ndisagreed in their primary diagnoses. Cuneo believed that defendant\nsuffered, primarily, from PTSD; Killian’s principal diagnosis was\ndissociation; and Merikangas determined that defendant suffered\nfrom organic brain disease. Merikangas disagreed with Killian’s and\nCuneo’s diagnoses of PTSD and dissociative personality disorder.\nKillian and Cuneo believed that defendant was legally sane, but\nmentally ill, as defined in section 6–2(d). Merikangas testified that\ndefendant was insane.\n     In addition to their conflicting diagnoses, the court noted that the\ntestimony of defendant’s experts also failed to account for\ndefendant’s ability to function adequately in the Marine Corps, and\nlater as a security guard, while suffering from the diagnosed illnesses.\nTheir diagnoses failed to explain how a person thus afflicted could\nsuccessfully plan, execute, and conceal eight murders over a period\nof 10 years. Disagreeing with the assessments of Merikangas and\nKillian–that defendant’s crimes were not characterized by planning\nand organization–the court noted that defendant brought a gun, a\nknife, duct tape, and handcuffs on the night of Corum’s murder. The\ncourt believed that defendant’s actions during the offense were\ninconsistent with those of a person overcome by anger, noting, on the\nnight defendant killed Cassandra Corum, he drove well over an hour,\nand approximately 100 miles, after he supposedly became angry and\nkidnapped her. It would appear that defendant had time to cool off;\nbut defendant killed Corum anyway.\n     We have held that a judgment is against the manifest weight of\nthe evidence when an opposite conclusion is apparent, or when the\nfindings appear to be unreasonable, arbitrary or not based on the\nevidence.

After careful review of this record, we cannot say that the\ntrial court’s rulings in this regard were against the manifest weight of\nthe evidence. Although defendant argues that Dietz’s definition of\nmental illness was unduly restrictive and his views diverged from\nthose generally accepted in the psychiatric community, a review of\nan expert opinion recently rendered in another capital case would\nseem to refute defendant’s position.\n     We note the testimony of Dr. Andrew Kowalkowski, as\nsummarized in People v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2137995\"><a href=\"/opinion/2137995/people-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006). Like Dr.\n\n                                  -62-\n\fDietz, Kowalkowski believed that mental disorders or illnesses are\ncharacterized by evidence of delusions, false fixed beliefs, or\nmisinterpretation of external reality. Thompson, 222 Ill. 2d at 24-25.\nKowalkowski differentiated such “delusional disorders” from\n“behavioral” disorders, such as personality disorders, which are “not\nsignificant mental disorders.” (Emphasis in original.) Thompson, 222\nIll. 2d at 39. Kowalkowski believed that Thompson’s personality\ndisorder “manifested itself in *** his impulsiveness, his irritability\nand aggressiveness, his repeated failure to maintain consistent work\nbehavior and his lack of remorse.” Thompson, 222 Ill. 2d at 25.\nKowalkowski testified that Thompson’s killing spree could be\nexplained by his personality disorders. Thompson, 222 Ill. 2d at 40.\n     The similarities between Dietz’s and Kowalkowski’s diagnoses,\nand Thompson’s and this defendant’s symptoms, are so obvious as\nto require no further comment. Dietz’s opinion does not appear to be\nout of the mainstream of his profession, and it finds support in the\nfacts of record. As the trial court’s ruling suggests, the attendant facts\nand circumstances of defendant’s crimes are themselves a compelling\nrefutation of testimony given by the defense experts, independent of\nDietz’s testimony. For the foregoing reasons, we find no basis for\nreversing the trial court’s determination that defendant failed to\nsustain his burden on the issue of mental illness.\n     We would add, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the\ncircuit court erred in rejecting defendant’s plea of guilty but mentally\nill, defendant is not entitled to a new sentencing hearing, as he argues\nbefore this court. As we will explain later, the circuit court’s rejection\nof defendant’s plea did not affect defendant’s ability to present\nmitigating evidence of his mental condition at sentencing, and\nreferences to defendant’s unsuccessful insanity defense were proper\nand duly circumscribed.\n\n                              Sentencing\n       I.

The trial judge then advised the parties:\n         “I’m not limiting either the direct or cross-examination of a\n         particular expert. So you want to have an expert on the stand\n         for two days, that’s fine with me. You can go over his entire\n         report if you like. *** [I]f all those questions are then asked\n         of a witness, then the opposite side knows what to cross on.\n         *** So the only point I’m making is that there is an unlimited\n         opportunity to inquire of these experts.”\nThe trial court subsequently ruled that the reports would not go to the\njury, noting, inter alia, “that’s why we have the experts testifying\nbecause we are in a realm beyond the normal knowledge of the\njurors.” The court’s statement evinces its concern that, in the absence\nof explanatory expert testimony, psychiatric reports in the hands of\nthe jurors could have been a source of misunderstanding, confusion,\nand unchallenged opinion evidence.\n    We find no error in the circuit court’s ruling. No restrictions were\nplaced on defendant’s right to present relevant evidence. The court\nmade clear that defendant could call an expert and “go over his entire\nreport” if defendant chose to do so. The limitation the court placed on\nthe method for introducing that evidence appears, in part, to have\nbeen for the purpose of safeguarding the opposing party’s right of\nconfrontation and cross-examination, and in part to ensure that the\njury received adequate explanatory testimony. We find that the\ncourt’s ruling was reasonable and entirely proper.\n    Defendant could have called any of his experts he deemed\nnecessary. Presumably, he called those whom he believed were\nimportant to his defense. Moreover, defendant could have questioned\n\n\n                                 -64-\n\fthe experts he did call about specific information contained in a\nnontestifying expert’s report, so long as the former relied upon\ninformation contained in the report of the latter. In that way, he could\nhave elicited some of the information contained in the reports of\nnontestifying experts. We conclude there was no error, and defendant\nwas accorded the rights he was due.\n\n   II. Trial Court’s Conduct in the Cross-Examination of Killian\n    Defendant next contends that the trial court deprived him of due\nprocess by acting “as an advocate for the State, where the trial judge\nassisted the prosecutor in cross-examining a defense expert and\nestablishing a foundation for admission of an exhibit that was highly\nprejudicial to the defense.” For purposes of clarity, we note that\ndefendant’s argument of error is confined to the trial court’s conduct\nin the sentencing examination of Dr. Killian. Defendant does not\notherwise argue that the evidence in question was improperly elicited\nand placed before the jury. In fact, his argument appears to concede\nthat there was an adequate foundation for the introduction of the\nevidence.\n    The evidence elicited consisted of certain questions posed to\ndefendant by Dr. Opsahl as part of the sentence-completion test, and\ndefendant’s answers to those questions. During the prosecutor’s\ncross-examination of Dr. Killian, Killian admitted that he had\n“reviewed” the sentence-completion test when forming his opinion.\nWhen the prosecutor handed Killian the sentence-completion test,\nand asked if that was the test he had reviewed, defense counsel\nobjected, arguing that the test was not relevant unless Killian had\nrelied upon the test in formulating his opinion. The prosecutor was\nthen allowed to question Killian as to whether he had relied upon the\nreport. Killian responded to the prosecutor’s question by first\nacknowledging that he had “looked at” the test, but had “not included\na description” of it in his own report. When the prosecutor again\nasked if Killian had relied on the test in his assessment of defendant,\nKillian said, equivocally, he did not “think” he did. Pressing for an\nunequivocal answer, the prosecutor again asked if some of the\nanswers on the test had helped Killian formulate his opinion. Killian\nthen answered that he could not “specifically recall,” but offered to\nexamine the test again. After he had done so, Killian stated that the\ndefendant’s test answers were “consistent with” what Killian “already\nbelieved about him from everything else [Killian] had read.” When\n\n                                 -65-\n\fthe prosecutor asked Killian to specify, defense counsel objected and\nasked to approach the bench. The trial court responded by\nannouncing a brief recess and, outside the jury’s presence, observed\nthat the witness was “not being responsive.” The court noted that\nKillian had stated he had not included the test in his report, but had\nnot unequivocally stated whether he had disregarded the test or relied\nupon it. He had essentially “skirted the issue.” The court concluded:\n“I think we need a vigorous interrogation on foundation by the State\nto see where this witness goes because he’s going in both directions.”\nIt is unclear from the transcript whether Killian was present when the\ncourt’s remarks were made; however, it is obvious that the remarks\nwere not directed to him personally.\n     When questioning resumed, out of the presence of the jury,\nKillian conceded that he had taken into account all of the materials\nplaced before him, and then qualified his answer by adding, “[I]t’s\nnot accurate to say that each piece of paper received the same amount\nof attention as any other piece of paper.” When the prosecutor asked\nif defendant’s test answers were important in Killian’s analysis,\nKillian stated: “I’m answering this as well as I can.”\n     The court then admonished Killian to answer the question asked,\nif he understood it, and, if he did not understand the question, to\nsimply say so. When the court had the question read back, Killian\nappeared to better understand the question, and answered that he\nconsidered defendant’s answers to the sentence-completion test\n“somewhat important.” When the prosecutor returned to the critical\nquestion he had posed at the outset, asking Killian whether he taken\ndefendant’s answers into account in arriving at his conclusion, Killian\nresponded with the same unresponsive answer that had initiated the\nexchange: “Not specifically, I did not include them in my report.” As\nthe prosecutor began to protest, the court again interceded, stating:\n         “Sir, there was a question asked you and you answered a\n         different question. *** I want you to listen to the question\n         asked of you and then I want you to answer that question\n         unless you don’t understand it. Do we understand each\n         other?”\nKillian responded affirmatively. When the question was read back,\nhe finally answered, unequivocally, that he took defendant’s answers\ninto account when forming his own opinion. With that, the court\ndetermined that a sufficient foundation existed to go into the\nsentence-completion test before the jury. Before the jury was called\n\n                                 -66-\n\fback into the courtroom, the court asked defense counsel if there was\nanything he wanted to contest in terms of that ruling, and counsel\nresponded, “It’s proper, I agree. He took it into account; so, it’s fair\ngame.” The prosecutor then proceeded to question the witness about\nthe sentence-completion test, questioning which–as we have\nobserved–defendant does not otherwise challenge.\n     We note that a trial judge has the discretion, when necessary, to\nadmonish a witness to answer questions directly and responsively.\nPeople v. Arnold, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2249290\"><a href=\"/opinion/2249290/people-v-arnold/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 97 (1954); see People v.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (1992). In our view, the trial court properly\nexercised its discretion in this case, admonishing a witness who was\nbeing evasive. Similar admonitory remarks, even when made in front\nof a jury, have been found appropriate and not prejudicial. See\nPeople v. Kukulski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3415081\"><a href=\"/opinion/3418723/the-people-v-kukulski/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608-09 (1934) (repeatedly advising\nthe witness to listen and answer the question); People v.

Osborne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047843\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047843/people-v-osborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139 (1966)\n(“Mr. Jones, the question is simple. The court believes the witness is\nbeing evasive about answering it”).\n     We find that the court in this case did not act in the capacity of an\nadvocate, as defendant suggests. Rather, the court sought to ensure\nthe State’s right to responsive answers from an evasive witness.\n\n       III. Comments Regarding Defendant’s Insanity Defense\n     Defendant next contends he was “denied due process and\nfundamental fairness where the trial judge informed the sentencing\njury that he had rejected the defendant’s insanity defense at trial, and\nwhere the prosecutor reminded the sentencing jury in closing\nargument that the trial judge had rejected the insanity defense.”\nAccording to defendant, those statements “improperly demeaned\n[his] mitigating evidence of mental illness, and punished [him] for\nexercising his constitutional right to present a defense.”\n     The State points out, inter alia, that defense counsel asked the\ntrial court to explain to the jurors why insanity was no longer an issue\nin the case, and attorney Elmore and the court advised the prosecutor\nthat he could clarify the status of insanity as an issue in closing\n\n\n                                  -67-\n\fargument. Thus, the State contends, if there was error, the defense\ninvited the court and prosecutor to commit it. We would agree;\nhowever, we conclude there was no error.\n     When the initial eight jurors were selected, they were told that\ndefendant had asserted the defense of insanity and they were\nquestioned about their ability to find defendant not guilty by reason\nof insanity if the defendant established that defense by a\npreponderance of the evidence. When the defendant subsequently\nchose to have the trial court consider and decide whether he was\nlegally insane at the time of the offense, that issue was removed from\nthe jury’s consideration, and some explanation became necessary.\nRecognizing that need, attorney Skelton asked the trial judge to “give\nthought to a potential admonition” to the jurors. Skelton explained:\n        “I think in fairness to the State as well as the defense, the\n        Court needs to advise them *** not that they were selected\n        under *** a now nonexistent theory, but something to lighten\n        the blow for both *** of us. *** And there might be some\n        fallout. I think the likely destination for that fallout is on the\n        defense. But I would like the Court to give some thought to\n        a potential admonition to the jury to straighten them out.”\nPursuant to that request, the court later submitted its proposed\nremarks to counsel for the defense and the State. Both defense\nattorneys indicated they had they had no problem with the content of\nthe court’s proposed explanation. The court then read those remarks\nto the jurors, explaining why they would not be participating in the\nfirst two stages of the tripartite capital procedure, and advising them\nof the findings the court had made in the first two phases. In the\ncourse of the court’s explanation, the judge told jurors he had rejected\ndefendant’s defense of insanity, and thrice read the jurors the\nstatutory definition of insanity. He did not mention the rejection of\ndefendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill, and he did not in any way\nsuggest that defendant’s mental condition was irrelevant to the jury’s\nsentencing decision.\n     Moreover, as previously noted, defense counsel’s opening\nstatement to the jurors made clear that they could still consider\nwhether defendant “suffer[ed] from any mental illness or mental\ndisease or mental defects” that affected his behavior. In their closing\narguments during the sentencing phase, the parties both\nacknowledged that “insanity” was no longer an issue; however, the\nexistence and consequences of defendant’s alleged mental or\n\n                                  -68-\n\fpersonality disorders were nonetheless the subject of extensive\ncomment. Indeed, after each of two instances when the prosecutor\nreminded the jury that insanity was no longer an issue, he eventually\naddressed statutory mitigating factors pertaining to defendant’s\nmental condition. His argument made clear that defendant’s mental\ncondition was a viable sentencing issue, but he felt that defendant\nshould receive a death sentence notwithstanding. Finally, the trial\ncourt’s instructions to the jury also underscored the relevance of\ndefendant’s mental condition in the sentencing decision. Under the\ncircumstances, we conclude that the comments of the court and the\nprosecutor were proper, and no error occurred.\n\n                  IV. Other Prosecutorial Comments\n    Defendant contends that other comments of the prosecutor were\nimproper and denied him a fair sentencing hearing. Specifically,\ndefendant argues that the prosecutor acted improperly when he (1)\n“emphasized that the jurors had taken an oath and promised to follow\nthe law, and then argued that the evidence in aggravation required\nthem under oath to impose a death sentence”; (2) invoked the\nintegrity of his office as a justification for seeking the death penalty;\nand (3) inflamed the passions of the jurors by referring to the families\nof the victims left behind and speculating about “how many children\nand grandchildren will not be born because of the actions of the\ndefendant.”\n    Defendant’s first claim of error is based upon two remarks of the\nprosecutor that appear 90 pages apart in the record of proceedings. In\nthe early portion of his closing argument, the prosecutor told the\njurors:\n            “[Y]ou were all selected to serve in this serious case\n        based on those promises that you made to the attorneys\n        during jury selection. Now on behalf of the People of the\n        State of Illinois and the People of the County of Livingston,\n        I’m asking you to keep those promises that you made under\n        oath several weeks ago.”\nMuch later, the prosecutor stated:\n            “Is he really worthy of your mercy? Ask yourselves with\n        all he did, is he really worthy of your mercy? I hate to admit\n        it, but we’ve really become a nation of excuse makers.\n        There’s always an excuse. Nothing is ever our fault. There\n\n                                  -69-\n\f        must be something in this person’s past that made him do\n        things. Well, we can’t take responsibility.\n            Allowing Andrew Urdiales to receive a natural life\n        sentence rather than the death penalty diminishes the\n        importance of Cassie Corum’s life and doesn’t serve the ends\n        of justice.”\nDefendant actually argues that these two passages are related and that\nthe jurors would have so perceived them: “Collectively, these\ncomments lectured the jury that imposing any penalty short of a death\nsentence would be irresponsible, and would constitute a violation of\nthe jury’s oath.”\n    Obviously, the prosecutor never told the jurors that their oath\nrequired them to impose the death penalty. The construction\ndefendant places upon these remarks is simply preposterous. The\nquoted comments do not support defendant’s claim of error even\nwhen they are taken out of context and placed in artificial tandem for\nargumentative exposition. This allegation of error deserves no further\ncomment.\n    We also reject defendant’s contention that he was denied a fair\nsentencing hearing because the prosecutor, during closing argument,\nimproperly “invoked the integrity of his office as a justification for\nseeking the death penalty.” We note, initially, that defendant did not\nobject to the remarks in question; therefore, he has forfeited this\nissue. See People v. Franklin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2143512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2143512/people-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (1990). As in\nFranklin, we find that the remarks did not constitute error in any\nevent.\n    Defendant cites the following remarks in support of his argument:\n            “The decision to seek a death penalty is not a decision\n        that is lightly made by any prosecutor. A lot of things go into\n        consideration as to whether or not a person such as myself\n        would decide to seek the death penalty. I think a lot of people\n        think that every time there’s a murder committed that a\n        prosecutor gets to decide whether or not he’s going to seek\n        the death penalty. That’s simply not true. The law of the State\n        of Illinois only provides for the death penalty under certain\n        circumstances; and when those certain circumstances exist, it\n        is only then that the prosecutor has the discretion to make the\n        decision of whether or not to seek the death penalty. Careful\n        consideration has to be given and justice must be done, and\n\n\n                                 -70-\n\f         careful consideration has been given in this case as to whether\n         or not to seek the death penalty. Now we’re seeking that\n         justice be done in this case.”\n     Although not referenced in defendant’s brief, the prosecutor made\nother pertinent comments thereafter, remarks that we believe have a\nbearing upon the disposition of this issue. For example, soon after he\nmade the foregoing statements, the prosecutor made clear to the\njurors that the decision to impose the death penalty was theirs, and\ntheirs alone:\n             “You’ve seen and heard all the evidence that’s going to be\n         introduced in this case, and now the decision is yours. It’s\n         your decision to decide whether or not this Defendant,\n         Andrew Urdiales, in this case if it’s appropriate to impose the\n         death penalty. That’s your decision.”\n     The prosecutor later spoke to the jurors about the procedures for\ndetermining whether defendant would receive a death sentence. He\ncorrectly informed them that they would consider factors in\naggravation and mitigation in arriving at the appropriate sentence,\nthat unanimity would be required for a death sentence, and that\ndefendant would be sentenced to life in prison, without the possibility\nof release, if they were unable to find unanimously that death was the\nappropriate sentence.\n     The prosecutor made clear that his role in the adversarial process,\nhis “job,” was to talk to the jury about aggravating evidence. He\nobserved: “My job is not to mitigate here. *** [Y]ou’ll hear\nmitigating evidence when the defense gets to argue. But at this point\nin time, I’m going to give you the reasons, the evidence that support\n[sic] the Defendant should receive the death penalty from you folks\nwhen you go in and deliberate.”\n     The prosecutor then discussed, at length, the aggravating\nevidence, and urged the jury find that death was the appropriate\nsentence. As he concluded the initial portion of his closing argument,\nthe prosecutor’s remarks again served to remind the jurors that he, as\nthe prosecutor, was part of an adversarial process: “I’m sure that Mr.\nSkelton will have the opportunity now to address you; and he’ll make\na detailed argument as to why these eight murders and rape don’t\njustify a verdict on you folks’ part in favor of the death penalty.”\n     Following defense counsel’s closing argument, wherein he\ndiscussed the evidence in mitigation, the prosecutor made an\n\n\n                                 -71-\n\fabbreviated rebuttal argument, and the jury was then instructed in the\napplicable law. It is in this context that we consider the defendant’s\nclaim of error.\n     As we observed in People v. Jamison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2058657\"><a href=\"/opinion/2058657/people-v-jamison/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 161 (2001),\nthis court has long recognized that the State’s Attorney is endowed\nwith the exclusive discretion to decide which of several charges shall\nbe brought, or whether to prosecute at all. A prosecutor’s discretion\nextends to the decision about whether or not the death penalty should\nbe sought. Jamison, 197 Ill. 2d at 162.\n     In this case, the prosecutor correctly explained to the jurors the\nprocedure for seeking the death penalty, and advised them of his role\nin the capital process, as well as theirs. He obviously believed it was\nappropriate to seek the death penalty, or he would not have done so.\nIn that respect, his comments did not tell the jurors anything they had\nnot already deduced. To suggest that those comments could have\nimproperly swayed the jury is, in our opinion, to discredit the\ncommon sense and intelligence of those who served on the jury. In\nhis argument, the prosecutor left no doubt that his role was that of an\nadvocate in an adversarial process, and he clearly and repeatedly\nadvised the jurors that the decision whether or not to impose the death\npenalty was theirs alone.\n     In that respect, the prosecutor’s argument was very different from\nthose found objectionable in other cases. For example, in People v.\nYates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2103369\"><a href=\"/opinion/2103369/people-v-yates/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536-38 (1983), the prosecutor, in effect, told the\njury that he would assume responsibility for imposition of the death\npenalty. As this court noted, the assistant State’s Attorney in that case\nalso suggested that his “previous experience was somehow relevant\nto whether [the] defendant should be sentenced to death.” Yates, 98\nIll. 2d at 539. This court ordered a new sentencing hearing,\nconcluding that both remarks were improper: the former, because it\n“obviously served to diminish the jury’s sense of responsibility and\nmitigate the serious consequences of its decision”; the latter, because\nit “served to inject an improper and irrelevant consideration into the\njury’s deliberations.” Yates, 98 Ill. 2d at 538-39. In this capital case,\nas in others, a principal concern in our review is that comments of the\nprosecutor in closing argument do not diminish the sentencing jury’s\nsense of responsibility. See People v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2036059\"><a href=\"/opinion/2036059/people-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288\n(1992); People v. Franklin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2143512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2143512/people-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (1990). A capital\nsentencing jury bears the sole responsibility for determining whether\na defendant is sentenced to death, and it may not be informed either\n\n                                  -72-\n\fdirectly or by implication that this responsibility is shared or rests\nelsewhere, either with the court (see Flores, 153 Ill. 2d at 288) or\nwith the prosecutor (see Yates, 98 Ill. 2d at 537-38).\n    In this case, the prosecutor advised the jury that it was his\ndecision to seek the death penalty, and it was for them to decide\nwhether to impose it. That is a correct statement of law and\nprocedure. His comments further made clear that he was not an\nimpartial arbiter on the question of whether the death penalty should\nbe imposed, but was in fact an advocate for a position in an\nadversarial process. Common sense would indicate that his opinion\nwas reflected in the discretionary actions he took–as is the case with\nany prosecutor. The comments in question did not undermine or\ndiminish the jury’s sense of responsibility. Considering the\ncomplained-of remarks in the context of the entire closing argument,\nwe find no error.\n    We finally consider defendant’s contention that the prosecutor\n“improperly inflamed the passions of the jury by referring to the\nfamilies the victims left behind and speculating about ‘how many\nchildren and grandchildren will not be born because of the actions of\nthe defendant.’ ” During closing argument to the sentencing jury, the\nprosecutor stated:\n        “J.A. is the only one to get away with her life. The others\n        weren’t so lucky. How many children and grandchildren will\n        not be born because of the actions of the defendant? Each of\n        these girls had a family. Each one of them had their lives in\n        front of them. Each one of them would have been able to\n        have kids probably I assume at some point in their lives.\n        Those were all taken away by the acts of this one man.”\n    In People v. Emerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098683\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098683/people-v-emerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 508-10 (2000), this court\nheld that similar remarks constituted an improper appeal to the\nemotions of the jurors. In Emerson, the prosecution argued:\n            “Her name was Delinda Byrd. Delinda Byrd, a victim in\n        this case. She had a life. She had hopes. She had dreams.\n        They were taken away from her by Dennis Emerson. They\n        were taken away from her only because he cared about\n        nothing. Nothing, but himself. The last moments of her life\n        were spent struggling for breath while 90 percent of her skin\n        was being burned. Imagine her terror. Imagine her fear. ***\n\n\n\n                                -73-\n\f             *** This is the defendant that did that to her, that turned\n         her into a corpse, who took away all her hopes and dreams\n         and took away all of what she could contribute to society and\n         to the community, and all of what she could contribute to\n         everyone that knew her and enriched their lives.” Emerson,\n         189 Ill. 2d at 508-09.\nAlthough we found the foregoing remarks improper, we nonetheless\nconcluded that the comments, “in and of themselves,” were not so\nprejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a fair sentencing hearing.\nEmerson, 189 Ill. 2d at 510. Similarly, in People v. Kokoraleis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2119320\"><a href=\"/opinion/2119320/people-v-kokoraleis/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285 (1989), the prosecutor commented on the victims’\nrights to get married, have a family, have children, and spend time\nwith their families. Though this court found that the prosecutor’s\nargument was improper, the court concluded that the remarks did not\naffect the overall fairness of the sentencing hearing. Kokoraleis, 132\nIll. 2d at 285.\n     We so find in this case. The jury heard the details of defendant’s\neight murders and the graphic testimony of his one surviving victim.\nThe prosecutor’s brief and isolated comments, while improper, were\nnot so prejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a fair sentencing\nhearing or change the outcome of the proceeding.\n\n              V. Instructions Pertaining to Mitigation\n    Defendant next contends that his “death sentence is\nfundamentally unjust because the sentencing jury was never\ninstructed that it could consider the defendant’s background of\nextreme emotional or physical abuse as a mitigating factor.” As\ndefendant points out, as part of the death penalty reforms enacted by\nthe General Assembly (see Pub. Act 93–605, eff. November 19,\n2003), a new provision was added to section 9–1(c) of the Criminal\nCode, specifically stating that a defendant’s background of “extreme\nemotional or physical abuse” shall be considered as a mitigating\nfactor. Although defendant’s brief does not acknowledge that this\nprovision was in effect at the time of his trial in May of 2004, it\nclearly was in effect as of November 19, 2003.\n    We note, initially, that defendant tendered an instruction\naddressing applicable mitigating factors, and that instruction was\ngiven by the trial court; however, the tendered instruction did not\ninclude the language which defendant now claims was erroneously\n\n\n                                 -74-\n\fomitted. It is well established, by case law and rule, that a defendant\nmay not raise on appeal the failure to give an instruction unless the\ndefendant tendered the instruction at trial. People v. Hopp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2012645\"><a href=\"/opinion/2012645/people-v-hopp/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (2004); People v.

The\npertinent portion of the instruction tendered by defendant read as\nfollows:\n             “Mitigating factors include:\n             First: Any or all of the following if supported by the\n         evidence:\n             The murder was committed while the defendant was\n         under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional\n         disturbance, although not such as to constitute a defense to\n         the prosecution.\n             The defendant suffers from a reduced mental capacity.\n             Second: Any other reason supported by the evidence why\n         the defendant should not be sentenced to death.\n             Where there is evidence of a mitigating factor, the fact\n         that such mitigating factor is not a factor specifically listed in\n         these instructions does not preclude your consideration of the\n         evidence.”\nObviously, the language that forms the basis of defendant’s\ncontention of error was not included in the instruction tendered by\ndefense counsel–the instruction the trial court ultimately gave. The\nissue was not raised in a posttrial motion. Defendant does not claim\nthat trial counsel was ineffective insofar as he tendered an instruction\nthat did not include the language in question. The defendant does not\nargue plain error.\n    Rather, defendant repeatedly refers to subsection (c)(6) of section\n9–1 as “recently enacted” and “new,” suggesting that he erroneously\nbelieves the statutory provision was not in effect at the time of his\nsentencing hearing. This inference is supported by a concluding\nsentence in his original brief: “That future defendants will have that\nbenefit, while Andrew Urdiales did not, is ‘fundamentally unjust.’ ”\n    Subsection (c)(6) was available to defendant; however, trial\ncounsel did not utilize it in their tendered instruction. Defendant does\nnot claim that they were ineffective in that respect; nor does he\nexplain why he believes the statutory provision was not available to\n\n\n                                   -75-\n\fcounsel. In short, defendant does not address his procedural default\nin any way. Thus, defendant has forfeited the issue.\n     Although defendant does not cite Supreme Court Rule 451(c)\n(177 Ill. 2d R. 451(c)), we note that rule’s “exception to the waiver\nrule for substantial defects applies when there is a grave error or\nwhen the case is so factually close that fundamental fairness requires\nthat the jury be properly instructed.” Hopp, 209 Ill. 2d at 7. Neither\nfactor is a consideration in this case.\n     The instruction the jury received was adequate to encompass\nconsideration of the evidence in question. In addition to specific\ninstructions bearing upon defendant’s mental state, the jury was\ninstructed that it could consider, in mitigation, “[a]ny other reason\nsupported by the evidence why the defendant should not be sentenced\nto death.” Continuing, the instruction informed the jury: “Where\nthere is evidence of a mitigating factor, the fact that such mitigating\nfactor is not a factor specifically listed in these instructions does not\npreclude your consideration of the evidence.”\n     In People v. Kirchner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2014063\"><a href=\"/opinion/2014063/people-v-kirchner/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), this court\nconsidered the efficacy of an identical catch-all instruction. In that\ncase, defendant claimed he was improperly denied a specific\ninstruction pertaining to the likelihood of his rehabilitation.\nDefendant claimed reversible error because the trial court refused to\ninstruct the jury that mitigating factors include that “[t]he defendant\nmay be rehabilitated or restored to useful citizenship.” Kirchner, 194\nIll. 2d at 554-55. In Kirchner, this court determined that a new\nsentencing hearing was not necessary, holding that the catch-all\ninstruction was adequate, under the facts of that case, to apprise the\njury that it could consider defendant’s potential for rehabilitation.\nKirchner, 194 Ill. 2d at 556-57.\n     In this case, Kendra Moses, defendant’s mitigation expert,\ntestified at length about the hardships and abuses defendant suffered\nin his formative years. Moreover, the jury heard extensive evidence\nregarding defendant’s mental condition–be it a mental illness or\npersonality disorder–and the origins of that condition. At least three\nof the testifying experts, including the State’s expert, believed that\ndefendant’s childhood experiences of abuse and/or neglect were\ncontributing factors in the formation of his current mental makeup,\na conclusion that few laymen would find surprising. That testimony\nwas inextricably tied to defendant’s argument that his mental\ncondition militated against the imposition of the death penalty. We\n\n                                  -76-\n\fhave no doubt that the jury considered defendant’s formative\nexperiences–particularly his mother’s temporary withdrawal, his\nsexual experience with his sister, and childhood teasing and\nbullying–and, correlatively, his mental condition, and appropriately\nweighed them against the details of eight brutal murders and the\nterrorism of J.A.\n    We have thoroughly reviewed the evidence in this case.\nAssuming, arguendo, that the abuse defendant suffered would qualify\nas “extreme,” we are confident that the jury’s verdict would not have\nbeen otherwise had the instruction been given with the proposed\nlanguage. See Kirchner, 194 Ill. 2d at 557, quoting Alvine, 173 Ill. 2d\nat 290 (“An error in a jury instruction is harmless if the result of the\ntrial would not have been different if a proper instruction had been\ngiven”).\n\n                            Apprendi Issue\n    Finally, defendant argues that the Illinois death penalty statute\nviolates principles announced in Apprendi in that it does not require\napplication of the reasonable doubt standard at the second stage of\ncapital sentencing proceedings. We have addressed and rejected that\nargument in People v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2137995\"><a href=\"/opinion/2137995/people-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52-54 (2006), People\nv.

Although defendant has not specifically argued that the\nevidence is insufficient to support his death sentence, it is our\nresponsibility in every death penalty case to consider the\nappropriateness of the sentence. People v. Heard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052374\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052374/people-v-heard/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85\n(1999). After careful consideration of the evidence adduced, we\nconcur in the jury’s determination that death is the appropriate\npenalty. Pursuant to section 9–1(i) of the Criminal Code (720 ILCS\n5/9–1(i) (West 2004)), we find no fundamental injustice in this case.\nFor the reasons stated herein, we affirm the defendant’s conviction\nand death sentence. We direct the clerk of this court to enter an order\nsetting Tuesday, May 8, 2007, as the date on which the sentence of\ndeath shall be carried out. Defendant shall be executed in the manner\n\n                                 -77-\n\fprovided by law. 725 ILCS 5/119–5 (West 2004). The clerk of this\ncourt shall send a certified copy of the mandate in this case to the\nDirector of Corrections, the warden of Tamms Correctional Center,\nand the warden of the institution where defendant is confined.\n\n                                                               Affirmed.\n\n    JUSTICE KILBRIDE, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n    I agree with the majority’s analysis of virtually all the issues\npresented in this case, including its examination of the questions\nimpacting on the guilt phase of defendant’s trial. I part company only\nwith the majority’s view that during the sentencing phase the jury\nneed not be specifically instructed on the mitigating effect of a\ndefendant’s history of abuse, as expressly required by subsection\n(c)(6) of section 9–1 (720 ILCS 5/9–1(c)(6) (West 2004)). Slip op. at\n76.\n    Subsection (c)(6) is one of a parcel of statutory protections\nenacted following the spate of seriously flawed capital cases that\nprompted the current moratorium on executions in this state. This\nsubsection states:\n            “The court shall consider, or shall instruct the jury to\n        consider any aggravating and any mitigating factors which\n        are relevant to the imposition of the death penalty. ***\n        Mitigating factors may include but need not be limited to the\n        following:\n                                  ***\n                (6) the defendant’s background includes a history of\n            extreme emotional or physical abuse[.]” (Emphases\n            added.) 720 ILCS 5/9–1(c)(6) (West 2004).\n    After noting that this subsection was in effect at the time of\ndefendant’s trial, the majority concludes that he has forfeited this\nclaim. Slip op. at 76. Ordinarily, I would agree that it is unnecessary\nto conduct a new sentencing hearing solely due to the omission of a\nspecific mitigating factor as long as a catchall instruction is included\ninforming the jury that the failure to list a particular mitigating factor\n“ ‘does not preclude [the jury’s] consideration of the evidence’ ” (slip\nop. at 76). See Kirchner, 194 Ill. 2d at 556-57. In this instance,\nhowever, I am otherwise persuaded by the historical underpinnings\n\n\n                                  -78-\n\fof the statutory changes at issue. The legislature enacted those\nchanges to reform our seriously flawed capital punishment system.\nThe legislature’s efforts, combined with those of this court (see 188\nIll. 2d Rs. 43, 411, 412(c), 416, 417, 701(b), 714), have effectuated\nfundamental changes in capital proceedings with the laudable goal of\nreducing the number of erroneous capital convictions and sentences\nentered in this state.\n     With that goal in mind, the legislature added subsection (c)(6),\nrequiring a jury instruction specifically pointing out the need for\njurors to consider a defendant’s background as a victim of abuse. 720\nILCS 5/9–1(c)(6) (West 2004). The statutory language mandates that\nthe court “shall” instruct the jury on the listed mitigating factors,\nincluding a history of abuse noted in subsection (c)(6). The plain\nlanguage added to redress Illinois’ troubled capital punishment\nsystem demonstrates the legislature’s clear intent to differentiate this\nfactor from the myriad of possible mitigation sources encompassed\nby the catchall instruction relied on by the majority. Slip op. at 76.\nThus, where, as here, there was evidence that defendant had\nundergone emotional and physical abuse as a child, the statute\nobliged the trial court to instruct the jury on this mitigating factor.\nReliance on a catchall instruction does not adhere to the will of the\nlegislature or uphold the spirit of the amendments.\n     Furthermore, the legislature added another statutory protection to\novercome the fundamental defects in our prior capital punishment\nsystem. That provision grants this court the authority to vacate a\nparticular death sentence and impose a term of years if that sentence\nis “fundamentally unjust” (720 ILCS 5/9–1(i) (West 2004)). Here, it\nis fundamentally unjust to ignore the legislature’s clear mandate that\njuries must be specifically apprised of the relevance of mitigating\nabuse evidence. Our legislature’s capital punishment reforms merit\nthe highest degree of judicial adherence because they are designed to\nrectify the serious problems in our prior system.\n     In addition, all the mental-health witnesses in this case agreed\nthat defendant suffered from some type of mental disorder, including\npossible organic brain disease, although they could not agree on a\nsingle diagnosis. Slip op. at 14-18. To submit to a jury the question\nof whether to impose the death penalty on defendant without strict\nadherence to the safeguards imposed by both this court and our\nlegislature flies in the face of fundamental justice and undermines\nthese fundamental reform efforts. The absence of the mitigating-\n\n                                 -79-\n\ffactor instruction in subsection (c)(6) unjustly contravenes the clear\nintent of our legislature and leaves the jury to resolve the life-and-\ndeath issue of imposing the death penalty without the specific\nguidance of a mitigating factor the legislature has deemed sufficiently\ncritical to single out for express consideration. Here, the evidence of\nabuse was relegated to the broad, undefined category of nonspecific\npotential mitigation material, failing to give it the distinct recognition\nintended by the legislature.\n     Given the immense gravity of the issues in capital proceedings,\nI believe both fundamental justice and the reliability of this state’s\ncapital punishment system require our courts to apply all legislative\nand judicial reform measures unwaveringly. If we do not, we risk a\nrecurrence of the tragic circumstances that prompted those reforms.\nThus, although I abhor the heinous crimes committed by this\ndefendant, I cannot countenance any erosion of our revised system of\ncapital punishment caused by lax enforcement of the newly minted\nsafeguards. Because the jury was not properly instructed in this case,\nI would remand this cause for a new sentencing hearing incorporating\nan instruction specifically noting the mitigating effect of emotional\nor physical abuse inflicted on defendant. For these reasons, I\nrespectfully dissent from the majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -80-\n\f</pre>",
