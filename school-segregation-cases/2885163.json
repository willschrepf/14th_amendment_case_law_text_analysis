The District Court concluded that the\nDelaware County Office of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation (“the County”) had violated Part C of the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) and the\nRehabilitation Act (“RA”) by denying the Ms’ twin sons\nservices in their natural environment, and granted the Ms\ncompensatory education and attorney’s fees. The County\nappealed, claiming that the Ms did not put forth evidence\nproving that the services required under the IDEA were\n\n                                2\n\fdiscontinued for the period in question or that the services were\nnot provided in an appropriate environment, and that the Ms\nfailed to prove an RA violation. For the reasons set forth below,\nwe will affirm the District Court’s grant of summary judgment\non the IDEA claim and reverse its grant of summary judgment\non the RA claim.\n\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n        R.M. and P.M. are brothers and fraternal twins who were\nborn on November 10, 2000. The Ms are their parents. In 2002,\nboth twins were presenting with significant speech and\ncommunication delays and functioning at levels significantly\nbelow their peers. Based on these problems, the County\ndetermined that they were eligible for Early Intervention (“EI”)\nservices in accordance with Part C of the IDEA, and assembled\na team to develop an Individualized Family Service Plan\n(“IFSP”) for each boy. After it was determined that the speech\nservices the twins received were not effective in the home, the\nIFSP team determined that services could better be rendered in\na classroom-based program as the boys needed social interaction\nwith peers and adults. Therefore, the team and the parents filled\nout a “Justification for Center-Based Services” form, which\nauthorized the boys’ speech services to be provided at a center\nfor special-needs children run by the Cerebral Palsy Association\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fof Delaware County (“CADES”).1 Both parties agree that the\ncenter is a segregated environment as it does not provide\nservices for children who are not disabled.\n\n       As part of their IFSPs, both R.M. and P.M. used the\nPicture Exchange Communication System (PECS). The PECS\nprovides a way for children with speech delays to communicate\nthrough the use of icons. Both boys received year-round PECS\nservices. In March of 2003, Mrs. M. requested that the twins be\nallowed to attend a two-week PECS summer camp. The request\nwas denied and the Ms sent the twins to the camp at their own\nexpense.\n\n       In the meantime, on January 20, 2003, Mrs. M. requested\nthat the EI services which were currently provided at the\nCADES center be provided in a “typical setting.” She told the\nCounty that she had found a location, St. Faith’s, where the boys\ncould have a classroom setting that included involvement with\nnon-developmentally-delayed children. The County denied that\nrequest, stating that Delaware County could not provide that\nservice as it did not have a contract to provide services at St.\nFaith’s. Therefore, on January 22, 2003, the Ms enrolled the\ntwins at St. Faith’s at their own expense. While there is a\ndispute as to whether the boys continued receiving certain EI\nservices somewhere other than St. Faith’s, the County agrees\n\n\n       1\n       Under Part C of the IDEA, if early intervention services\nare provided outside the natural environment, an IFSP must\ninclude a justification for such a change.          34 C.F.R.\n§ 303.344(d)(ii).\n\n                               4\n\fthat it did not provide EI services at St. Faith’s between January\nand June 2003. The County’s records indicate that Mrs. M.\nrequested services at St. Faith’s on at least two other occasions,\nApril 30, 2003 and May 2, 2003. Eventually, the County sent\nsomeone to observe the boys at St. Faith’s. Mindy Glassberg,\nthe boys’ primary PECS therapist, testified that she observed the\nboys on April 28 and May 1, 2003, at Mrs. M.’s request. The\nCounty’s records indicate that it sent someone from CADES to\nobserve the boys at St. Faith’s in late May 2003. On June 5,\n2003, the County informed the Ms that the CADES observer\nbelieved that two, hour-long units per month of speech services\nwould be appropriate at St. Faith’s. While Mrs. M. had been\nhoping for more frequent services, she agreed to begin with the\ntwo hours per month. Shortly thereafter, the boys began\nreceiving EI services at St. Faith’s.\n\n        In July, 2003, the Ms requested that a new PECS\ntherapist replace Glassberg. The Ms claim that during the\ntransitional period between therapists that followed, P.M. and\nR.M. were not provided the PECS services required by their\nIFSPs. The County did not dispute that there were missing\nPECS service hours.\n\n                               B.\n\n       Based on their disputes with the County over the twins’\nEI services, the Ms brought two different due process claims\nagainst the County. Initially, after the County denied Mrs. M.’s\nrequest that it pay for her sons’ attendance at the PECS summer\ncamp, the Ms brought a due process claim against the County\nseeking compensation for the boys’ attendance. After a three-\n\n                                5\n\fday hearing (on June 10, June 25, and July 10, 2003), the\nHearing Officer determined that, while attendance at the camp\nmight be beneficial for the boys, it was not necessary. The boys\nwere making appropriate progress under their IFSPs as written\nwithout attendance at the camp. Because there was general\nagreement between the Ms and the County that the IFSPs were\nappropriate, and because there was no strong evidence\nsuggesting the boys were required to attend the camp, the\nHearing Officer denied the Ms’ claim for compensation for the\nPECS summer camp.\n\n       The Ms appealed the decision to the District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania.2 In addition to seeking\ncompensation for the twins’ attendance at summer camp, the Ms\nalso made a claim for the missing PECS service hours, which\nhad not been briefed before the Hearing Officer. The District\nCourt ruled that the County erred in failing to fund the camp for\nP.M., but not for R.M. As to the missing service hours, the\nDistrict Court found that the Ms had not exhausted their\nadministrative remedies and, therefore, dismissed the claims\nwithout prejudice so that the Ms could return for a decision at\nthe administrative level.\n\n       In January 2005, the Ms returned to the administrative\nlevel seeking compensatory education for the PECS hours that\n\n\n       2\n       By the consent of the parties, the case was transferred to\na magistrate judge, who was designated as the trial judge.\nReferences in this opinion to the District Court indicate the\nmagistrate judge, sitting by designation.\n\n                               6\n\fwere missed during the therapists’ transition and seeking relief\nbecause the twins were not provided EI services in their “natural\nenvironment” for the first five months they were at St. Faith’s.\nThe Ms also made a claim under the RA. All evidence and\nadditional briefing was to be submitted to the Hearing Officer\nby May 24, 2005. The Ms submitted a brief on May 24 and\nadditional exhibits on May 28. The County did not submit any\ninformation. Based on the evidence before her, the Hearing\nOfficer ruled as to each twin individually.\n\n        The Hearing Officer made the following findings of fact.\nShe determined that both children suffered from developmental\ndelays that resulted in their approval for EI services under the\nIDEA. Both children had speech services transferred to the\nCADES center so as to receive services in a center-based\nprogram. This was necessary because the CADES program\nmaximized interaction with peers and adults and provided a\nstructured environment in which to engage in activities with\nother children and adults. After the twins began attending St.\nFaith’s, the Ms expressed concerns that the boys were not\ninteracting at an appropriate level and requested that someone\nfrom the County come observe the boys at St. Faith’s. “It took\nat least two months for someone to observe [the twins] at St.\nFaith’s.” As to the missing PECS hours, the Hearing Officer\ndetermined that the County failed to provide approximately\nnineteen hours of PECS services to R.M. and five hours of\nPECS services to P.M.\n\n       Based on these factual findings, the Hearing Officer\nmade the same legal determinations as to each boy (except for\nfinding that each was entitled to a different number of missing\n\n                               7\n\fPECS hours). The Hearing Officer first determined that there\nwas no dispute that the boys were deprived of PECS services\nwhile they were clients of the County. Finding that the most\ncommon remedy under Part B of the IDEA for deprivation of\nservices is compensatory education, the Hearing Officer found\nthat this was also an appropriate remedy under Part C and\nordered the County to provide R.M. with seventy-seven fifteen-\nminute units of compensatory education services and to provide\nP.M. with nineteen fifteen-minute units of compensatory\neducation services.\n\n        The Hearing Officer next addressed the Ms’ natural\nenvironment claims. The Hearing Officer determined that\n“natural environment” under Part C of the IDEA included St.\nFaith’s, as it was an environment where typical, non-\ndevelopmentally-delayed children would be found. Concluding\nthat the “natural environment” requirement under Part C of the\nIDEA was analogous to the “least restrictive environment”\nrequirement under Part B of the IDEA, the Hearing Officer\nfound that it was the County’s burden to show that the twins\nwere educated in their natural environment. She found that the\nCounty had failed to show that it had provided the boys with\nservices in their natural environment. The Hearing Officer\nultimately awarded the Ms $755.50 in tuition reimbursement for\neach child for the time spent at St. Faith’s without the services,\nbut did not award compensatory education for the five months\nthat services were not provided in the natural environment.3 The\n\n\n       3\n      The Hearing Officer also determined that this kind of\ncompensatory award was appropriate under the County’s Mental\n\n                                8\n\fHearing Officer did not address the Ms’ RA claim. The County\ndid not appeal the Hearing Officer’s decision.\n\n       Following the decision, the County paid the tuition\nreimbursement ordered by the Hearing Officer, but the ordered\ncompensatory education for the missing PECS hours was not\nprovided, as the parties could not agree as to how to make up\nthose hours. After the County refused to pay attorney’s fees that\nthe Ms had requested by letter, the Ms filed a complaint in the\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on\nAugust 12, 2005.\n\n        The Ms’ complaint sought attorney’s fees under the RA,\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and § 1983, the\nrelief they were due under the Hearing Officer’s opinion, and\nadditional relief not granted by the Hearing Officer. The Ms’\ncomplaint alleged that the Hearing Officer had found in favor of\ntheir children on the natural environment claim, but did not\nprovide compensation for the services listed on the IFSP that\nwere not provided when the children were at St. Faith’s. In\naddition, the Ms maintained that § 749a(b) of the RA provided\nan additional basis for recovery, including the award of\nattorney’s fees to the prevailing party in an action under the RA.\n\n       Following service of the Complaint, the parties filed\ncross-motions for summary judgment. Based on the motions,\nthe District Court entered judgment in favor of the Ms. As to\n\n\nHealth and Mental Retardation program as part of “special\ninstruction,” which is listed as a reimbursable expense.\n\n                                9\n\fthe Ms’ claim that the Hearing Officer agreed with them on their\nnatural environment claim but failed to provide compensation,\nthe District Court agreed, finding that the services that had been\nprovided to the twins at the CADES center prior to their\nenrollment at St. Faith’s had ceased as of January 2003. “The\nCounty has not argued here, nor did they argue before the\nH[earing] O[fficer], that the prescribed services were actually\nprovided between January and June, 2003, such as if, for\nexample, the children attended both CADES and St. Faith’s at\nthe same time.” It, therefore, awarded the Ms compensatory\neducation. As to the Ms’ claim under the RA, the District Court\nsimply stated that “I have found that the Plaintiffs’ claim for five\nmonths of compensatory education for the missing supplemental\nservices was valid. As the prevailing parties in a Rehabilitation\nAct case, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorney’s fees.” 4 The\nDistrict Court found that the County could not be held liable\nunder § 1983.\n\n        Following this initial decision, entered on January 18,\n2006, the District Court allowed the parties to provide additional\nbriefing on the issue of attorney’s fees. Following the receipt of\nbriefs on the issue, the District Court again determined that the\nMs could recover attorney’s fees. While Part C of the IDEA\ndoes not provide for the recovery of attorney’s fees, the District\nCourt stated that attorney’s fees were recoverable under\n§ 749a(b) of the RA. However, the District Court ruled that the\n\n\n       4\n        The District Court also found that the Ms could recover\nunder the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12117, but found that this was\nirrelevant to its decision.\n\n                                10\n\fonly fees which were recoverable were those expended in\nbringing the appeal to the District Court and not those costs that\nresulted from bringing the claims which were successful at the\nadministrative level. The District Court therefore awarded the\nMs approximately $15,000 in attorney’s fees.\n\n       This timely appeal followed.\n\n                               II.\n\n       We have jurisdiction over the final order of the District\nCourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We exercise plenary\nreview over a District Court’s grant of summary judgment,\nconsidering whether, based on the affidavits and documents\npresented, there are no genuine issues of material fact and the\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(c); Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., 423 F.3d 184, 207\n(3d Cir. 2005).         When reviewing an administrative\ndetermination under the IDEA, both the District Court and we\nuse a “modified de novo standard,” giving due deference to the\nadministrative determination. Shore Reg’l High Sch. Bd. of\nEduc. v. P.S., 381 F.3d 194, 199 (3d Cir. 2004). The legal\nstandards governing a grant of attorney’s fees are legal questions\nwhich we review de novo. In re AT&T Corp., 455 F.3d 160,\n163-64 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\n                               III.\n\n       Two of the claims in this case arise under Part C of the\nIDEA, 20 U.S.C. § 1431, et seq. Based on a Congressional\nfinding that there was an urgent need to “enhance development”\n\n                               11\n\ffor toddlers with disabilities and help families meet the needs of\ntheir toddlers with disabilities, Congress passed Part C of the\nIDEA to encourage states to create statewide programs to\nprovide for developmentally delayed and disabled toddlers. 20\nU.S.C. § 1431. Under Part C of the IDEA, IFSPs are developed\nwith the consent and cooperation of toddlers’ families. Id. at\n§ 1436(a)(2). “The IFSP contains a statement of the child’s\npresent levels of development, goals to be achieved for the child\nand the child’s family, and the services necessary to meet the\nstated goals.” Bucks County Dept. of Mental Health/Mental\nRetardation v. DeMora, 379 F.3d 61, 66 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing\n20 U.S.C. § 1436(d)). Services provided under Part C include\nfamily training and counseling, physical and occupational\ntherapy, speech therapy, special instruction, and social work\nservices. 20 U.S.C. § 1432(4)(E). These services are to be\nprovided, whenever possible, in the child’s “natural\nenvironment.” Id. § 1432(4)(G). As under the better-known\nPart B of the IDEA, parents who are dissatisfied with their\ntoddler’s IFSP or services may file a due process claim against\nthe state entity responsible for providing the services. Id.\n§ 1439.\n\n       The County claims that the District Court made two\nerrors when finding in the Ms’ favor on their IDEA due process\nclaim. It argues that the District Court inappropriately put the\nburden of proof on the County, as the defendant, to prove that\nservices continued while the twins were at St. Faith’s, and that\nthe District Court improperly found that services were not\nprovided in the twins’ natural environment.\n\n\n\n                               12\n\f                                A.\n\n       The County first contends that the District Court\nimproperly placed the burden on it to prove that appropriate\nservices were provided to the twins. In its opinion, the District\nCourt stated that the County failed to prove that any services\nwere provided to the twins while they were at St. Faith’s, as\nwould have been the case if, for example, the twins had\ncontinued attending CADES in addition to St. Faith’s. This, the\nCounty argues, impermissibly required it to bear the burden of\nproving the provision of services rather than requiring the Ms to\nprove the absence of services.\n\n        We begin our analysis of the appropriate burden of proof\nwith the language of the statute. Under Part C of the IDEA, an\naggrieved party may bring an action in a district court to resolve\nits grievance:\n\n       Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision\n       regarding an administrative complaint shall have\n       the right to bring a civil action with respect to the\n       complaint in any State court of competent\n       jurisdiction or in a district court of the United\n       States without regard to the amount in\n       controversy. In any action brought under this\n       paragraph, the court shall receive the records of\n       the administrative proceedings, shall hear\n       additional evidence at the request of a party, and,\n       basing its decision on the preponderance of the\n       evidence, shall grant such relief as the court\n       determines is appropriate.\n\n                                13\n\f20 U.S.C. § 1439(a)(1).5 Section 1439 does not contain any\nindication of which party bears the burden of proof when a\nclaim is brought.\n\n        As we have no case law directing the appropriate burden\nunder Part C of the IDEA, we turn to relevant case law under\nPart B. Prior to 2005, most courts agreed that, at the due\nprocess hearing, the state or county providing services to\nindividuals eligible under the IDEA bore the burden of proving\nthat it was providing appropriate services. L.E. v. Ramsey Bd.\nof Educ., 435 F.3d 384, 391 (3d Cir. 2006). However, that\nchanged with the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision in Schaffer v.\nWeast, 126 S. Ct. 528 (2005). The Supreme Court made very\nclear that it was speaking only of the burden of persuasion – in\nother words which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced\n– and not of the burden of production – which party bears the\nobligation to come forward with the evidence at different points\nin the proceedings. Id. at 534. Because of the presumption that\nthe plaintiff bears the burden of proving the essential elements\nof his claim, id., and finding nothing in the language of the\nIDEA to suggest otherwise, id. at 535-37, the Supreme Court\nheld that the burden of persuasion lies with the party seeking\nrelief. Id. at 537. Therefore, when the school district challenges\nan Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) under Part B, the\n\n\n       5\n        The County incorrectly cites 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2) for\nthe authorization of judicial review. Section 1415 provides the\nreview process for claims under Part B of the IDEA, which\ndeals with a free and appropriate education, not early\nintervention under Part C.\n\n                               14\n\fburden lies with it. When the parents challenge the IEP, the\nburden lies with them. We see no reason why the burden of\npersuasion would lie with a different party under Part C.\n\n        In addition to bearing the burden of persuasion, the party\nchallenging an administrative decision faces the additional\nhurdle of overcoming a presumption that the Hearing Officer’s\nfindings were correct. Although a district court may make its\nown findings of fact by a preponderance of the evidence and\nlook at evidence outside the administrative record, it is required\nto give the administrative decision “due weight.” Shore Reg’l\nHigh Sch., 381 F.3d at 199 (citing Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick\nHudson Cent. Sch. Dist., Westchester County v. Rowley, 458\nU.S. 176, 206 (1982)). “Under this standard, ‘[f]actual findings\nfrom the administrative proceedings are to be considered prima\nfacie correct,’ and ‘[i]f a reviewing court fails to adhere to them,\nit is obliged to explain why.’”            Id. (quoting S.H. v.\nState-Operated Sch. Dist. of City of Newark, 336 F.3d 260, 271\n(3d Cir. 2003)). In the case before us, these standards interact\nin an unusual fashion. In most cases under the IDEA, a party\nchallenging an administrative decision will need to challenge the\nfindings of the Hearing Officer. However, in this case, the\nHearing Officer’s factual determinations were favorable to the\nMs. It was only her failure to provide appropriate compensation\nand her failure to address the Ms’ RA claim that the Ms\nchallenged. Therefore, while the Ms bore the burden of\npersuasion at the District Court level, the County was bound by\nthe Hearing Officer’s determinations unless it could provide\nspecific evidence as to why those findings were incorrect. With\nthis in mind, we turn to the District Court’s finding regarding\nthe provision of services.\n\n                                15\n\f        In her decision, the Hearing Officer made several factual\nfindings. She determined that the twins were not provided\nservices at St. Faith’s prior to the time the County sent people to\nobserve them. “Months went by before MH/MR [the County]\neven agreed to observe [the twins] at St. Faith[’]s let alone\nprovide services there although St. Faith[’]s was [the twins’]\nnatural environment.” The District Court had to give due weight\nto that decision. However, the Hearing Officer did not explicitly\nfind that the County failed to provide services to the twins at a\nlocation other than St. Faith’s, such as CADES. Therefore, the\nDistrict Court’s statement that “[t]he County has not argued\nhere, nor did [it] argue before the H[earing] O[fficer], that the\nprescribed services were actually provided between January and\nJune, 2003, such as if, for example, the children attended both\nCADES and St. Faith’s at the same time[,]” was made based on\nits own review, not by giving due weight to the Hearing\nOfficer’s determination.\n\n       In their papers before the District Court, the Ms argued\nthat “the County failed to provide the twins with special\ninstruction for the first five months that they were in the natural\nenvironment.” They further alleged that “each twin is entitled\nto compensatory education for missing special instruction that\n[was] identified on each one’s IFSP but which [was] not\ndelivered from the point the County stopped delivering the\nservice until such time as the Team developed a new IFSP.”\n“Each twin was denied 20 hours of special instruction from\nJanuary 2003 until June 2003 – 100 hours each.” In support of\nthis contention, the Ms pointed to the fact that Mrs. M.\nrequested that services currently provided at the CADES center\nbe transferred to St. Faith’s, subsequently enrolled her children\n\n                                16\n\fin St. Faith’s, and then twice requested that services be provided\nat St. Faith’s. This, the Ms argue, allows for a reasonable\ninference that the twins were not being provided services\nanywhere. The County countered merely by stating that the Ms\ndid not provide sufficient evidence that services were not\nprovided. It never argued that services actually were provided.\nIn its opinion, the District Court faulted the County for failing\nto argue that services were provided or provide any evidence of\nthe continuation of services. The County argues that this\nimproperly shifted the burden of proof.\n\n        However, we need not decide whether under these\ncircumstances – where a party opposes summary judgment\nsimply by claiming a lack of proof rather than by disputing a\nmaterial fact – the District Court improperly placed the burden\non the defendant. The Ms did not need to prove that services\nstopped entirely in order to prove their claim. Just as a state\nagency may violate Part B of the IDEA by providing services\nbut failing to do so in the least restrictive environment, T.R. v.\nKingwood Twp. Bd. of Educ., 205 F.3d 572, 578-79 (3d Cir.\n2000), when an agency provides EI services but fails to provide\nthem in the natural environment without appropriate\njustification, that agency violates Part C of the IDEA. See 20\nU.S.C. § 1432(4)(g); 34 C.F.R. § 303.344(d)(a)(ii). As the Ms’\nclaim rests on the fact that services were not delivered at St.\nFaith’s, a fact the County admits, any error the District Court\n\n\n\n\n                               17\n\fmay have made by requiring the County to prove that it provided\nservices elsewhere was harmless.6\n\n                               B.\n\n        The question we are left with, then, is not whether there\nwas sufficient evidence to show that services were stopped\naltogether, but whether the District Court appropriately found\nthat the County had violated the IDEA by not providing EI to\nthe twins at St. Faith’s. In other words, we must address\nwhether St. Faith’s is the kind of natural environment\ncontemplated by the IDEA.\n\n       We again begin with the language of the statute. Part C\nof the IDEA provides money to states that “develop and\nimplement a comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary,\ninteragency system that provides early intervention services for\ninfants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.” 20\nU.S.C. § 1431(b)(1). Those services are to be provided, when\npossible, in the child’s “natural environment.” Id. § 1432(4)(G).\nThe child’s natural environment includes “the home and\n\n\n       6\n        We note that on appeal the County only claims that the\nMs failed to prove a violation of the IDEA, not that, even if they\nhad proved a violation of the IDEA, compensatory education\nwas the inappropriate remedy. Proof of a violation of Part C of\nthe IDEA does not require complete cessation of services. We\nmake no comment as to whether receiving compensatory\neducation as a remedy under Part C of the IDEA requires proof\nof the total termination of services.\n\n                               18\n\fcommunity settings in which children without disabilities\nparticipate.” 34 C.F.R. § 303.12(b). The regulations further\ndefine natural environment as “settings that are natural or\nnormal for the child’s age peers who have no disabilities.” Id.\n§ 303.18. Examples of such natural environments include “the\nhome, child care centers, or other community settings.” Id.\n§ 303.344, n. 1. If services will not be provided in a natural\nenvironment, the IFSP must include a justification. Id.\n§ 303.344(d)(a)(ii).\n\n        In the present case, the Hearing Officer determined, and\nthe District Court agreed, that the twins were denied access to\nspecial instruction in their natural environment. As the County\ndid not appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer, it appears\nthat it is bound by that decision. However, even if it was not\nbound by that legal determination, its claim would still fail. At\nthis stage, the County argues that “natural environment” does\nnot include preschools. It turns first to the language used to\ndescribe natural environment as support. Citing to Note 1 of 34\nC.F.R. § 303.344, the County states “[n]atural environments\nhave been described by the Legislature as including home, child\ncare centers and community settings, not preschools.” This\nargument reads the list of “natural environments” too narrowly.\nNote 1 to § 303.344 reads:\n\n       However, for these and other eligible children,\n       early intervention services must be provided in\n       natural environments (e.g., the home, child care\n       centers, or other community settings) to the\n       maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the\n       child.\n\n                               19\n\f34 C.F.R. § 303.344, n. 1 (emphasis added). Clearly this list of\nexamples is not exclusive, hence the “e.g.”            Natural\nenvironments can encompass more than simply homes and child\ncare centers.\n\n        In fact, the regulations define “natural environment”\nmuch more broadly than the list provided in Note 1 to\n§ 303.344. Natural environments are “settings that are natural\nor normal for the child’s age peers who have no disabilities.”\nId. § 303.18. The question is whether St. Faith’s was a normal\nsetting for a child the twins’ age without disabilities. The twins’\nIFSP team determined that both boys required “a structured\nenvironment that provides a balance of adult direction and\nchild[-]centered activities” and “modification[s] to maximize\ncommunication and interaction with peers and adults.” Parents\nlooking to encourage their non-disabled child’s interaction with\npeers and adults and engage their child in child-centered\nactivities would likely enroll their child in a day care or\npreschool. Therefore, St. Faith’s is precisely the kind of natural\nenvironment contemplated by the IDEA.7\n\n\n       7\n         The County makes a further argument that only the\ntwins’ home could be their natural environment. It argues that\nthe IFSP provided a justification for the twins’ enrollment in the\nCADES center-based program. Therefore, it argues, that must\nindicate that anything outside the home was outside the twins’\nnatural environment.       This argument is spurious.         The\njustification was required for the CADES center-based program\nbecause the center was a segregated center strictly for disabled\nchildren, which is clearly outside a setting that is natural for a\n\n                                20\n\f        The County also argues that the Hearing Officer’s\ncomparison between the “natural environment” requirement in\nPart C of the IDEA and the “least restrictive environment”\nrequirement under Part B of the IDEA was error. Under Part B\nof the IDEA, a child must be provided with educational services\nin the “least restrictive environment.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5).\nThis has often been referred to as the “mainstreaming\ncomponent” and requires that, if possible, children with\ndisabilities be educated with non-disabled children. See\nRamsey, 435 F.3d at 390. In her discussion about the natural\nenvironment, the Hearing Officer used case law on the least\nrestrictive environment as guidance, citing factors typically\nconsidered in those types of cases. We find this analogy\nappropriate and useful. The Hearing Officer did not determine\nthat a school is always the child’s natural environment, as is the\ncase with the least restrictive environment. Rather, she simply\ndetermined that the County had failed to make any showing as\nto efforts it made to provide the twins with services in their\nnatural environment or to provide them with supplemental\nservices in that environment, factors typically considered when\ndetermining if a state has provided appropriate services.8\n\n\n\nchild the twins’ age without a disability. 34 C.F.R. § 303.18.\n       8\n        At the time the Hearing Officer made her decision,\nSchaffer was not yet decided, and our leading case, Oberti v.\nBoard of Education, 995 F.2d 1204, 1219 (3d Cir. 1993), placed\nthe burden of proof on the school district or county. Therefore,\nthe County does not argue that the Hearing Officer erred by\nplacing the burden of proof on the County at the due process\n\n                               21\n\fTherefore, her award of reimbursement did not amount to\nrequiring the County to provide the twins a free and appropriate\neducation (a requirement not included under Part C), but was\nsimply a determination that the twins’ natural environment for\nsocial interaction was a preschool and that the County failed to\nprovide them services in that natural environment. Because the\nHearing Officer and the District Court appropriately determined\nthat the twins were not provided EI services in their natural\nenvironment, the County’s argument fails.9\n\n                              IV.\n\n       The County next claims that the District Court erred by\ngranting the Ms attorney’s fees under the RA. It argues, first,\nthat the Ms failed to prove a violation of the RA, and,\nalternatively, that even if the Ms had proved a violation,\n\n\n\nhearing.\n       9\n        We note again that the County only appeals the grant of\ncompensatory education based on a claimed error in the District\nCourt’s understanding of natural environment, not on the\nDistrict Court’s choice to award compensatory education in\naddition to the tuition reimbursement provided by the Hearing\nOfficer. While reimbursement of professional (EI) services is\ncertainly proper to remedy inadequate services under Part C of\nthe IDEA, Adams v. Oregon, 195 F.3d 1141, 1150 (9th Cir.\n1999), whether a parent can recover both preschool or child care\nfees in addition to early intervention services is a question we\nneed not reach today.\n\n                              22\n\fattorney’s fees are not appropriate because Part C of the IDEA\ndoes not allow such a recovery. We agree with the County that\nthe Ms failed to prove a violation of the RA.\n\n        The Ms premised their RA violation on the same facts\nused to prove their IDEA claim, namely that the County failed\nto provide services for their sons in their natural environment.\nIn its opinion, the District Court found that this was sufficient to\nprove a violation of the RA. Citing our opinions in Ridgewood\nBoard of Education v. N.E., 172 F.3d 238 (3d Cir. 1997), and\nW.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484 (3d Cir. 1995),10 the District Court\nstated that “there are very few differences, if any, between the\nIDEA’s affirmative duty to educate a handicapped child and the\nRehabilitation Act’s prohibition in § 504 of discrimination\nagainst a handicapped individual.” Therefore, because the Ms\nhad proved a violation of the IDEA, the District Court\nconcluded that they had also proved a violation of the RA. The\nDistrict Court was incorrect.\n\n      Our case law makes clear that a party may use the same\nconduct as the basis for claims under both the IDEA and the RA.\nIn Matula, we found that “Congress specifically intended that\n[Education of the Handicapped Act, the predecessor to the\n\n\n       10\n         We recognize that we have recently decided A.W. v.\nJersey City Pub. Sch., -- F.3d. ---, 2007 WL 1500335 (3d Cir.\nMay 24, 2007), which abrogated Matula in part. Id. at *3.\nHowever, our holding in A.W. does not affect Matula as it\npertains to this case. For purposes of the question currently\nbefore us, Matula remains good law.\n\n                                23\n\fIDEA,] violations could be redressed by § 504 . . . as the\nlegislative history reveals.” 67 F.3d at 494. However, this\nlanguage does not indicate that a violation of the IDEA is a per\nse violation of the RA, regardless of whether it meets the\nindependent requirements for an RA violation. As our case law\nindicates by citing the requirements of the RA even in cases also\nbrought under the IDEA, see Ridgewood, 172 F.3d at 253, that\na plaintiff must still prove that there was a violation of the RA.\n\n       Section 504 of the RA states:\n\n       No otherwise qualified individual with a disability\n       in the United States, as defined in section 705(20)\n       of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his\n       disability, be excluded from the participation in,\n       be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n       discrimination under any program or activity\n       receiving Federal financial assistance or under\n       any program or activity conducted by any\n       Executive agency or by the United States Postal\n       Service.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Under the regulations that accompany the\nRA, “qualified handicapped person” includes:\n\n       (2) With respect to public preschool[,]\n       elementary, secondary, or adult educational\n       services, a handicapped person (i) of an age\n       during which nonhandicapped persons are\n       provided such services, (ii) of any age during\n       which it is mandatory under state law to provide\n\n                               24\n\f       such services to handicapped persons, or (iii) to\n       whom a state is required to provide a free\n       appropriate public education under section 612 of\n       the Education of the Handicapped Act;\n\n       ...\n\n       (4) With respect to other services, a handicapped\n       person who meets the essential eligibility\n       requirements for the receipt of such services.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 104.3(l).\n\n         Based on this language, it is clear why violations of Part\nB of the IDEA are almost always violations of the RA. Under\n§ 612 of the IDEA, states accepting federal funds must provide\nchildren of a certain age a free and appropriate public education.\n20 U.S.C. § 1412. The regulations accompanying the RA adopt\nthis requirement and provide that a handicapped person is one\n“to whom a state is required to provide a free appropriate public\neducation under section 612 . . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 104.3(k).\nTherefore, when a state fails to provide a disabled child with a\nfree and appropriate education, it violates the IDEA. However,\nit also violates the RA because it is denying a disabled child a\nguaranteed education merely because of the child’s disability.\nIt is the denial of an education that is guaranteed to all children\nthat forms the basis of the claim. Therefore, a plaintiff can\nprove an RA violation where “(1) he is ‘disabled’ as defined by\nthe Act; (2) he is ‘otherwise qualified’ to participate in school\nactivities; (3) the school or the board of education receives\nfederal financial assistance; and (4) he was excluded from\n\n                                25\n\fparticipation in, denied the benefits of, or subject to\ndiscrimination at, the school.” Ridgewood, 172 F.3d at 253.\n\n        As the County argues, the analysis is not the same under\nPart C of the IDEA as it is under Part B. As we have\nestablished, children denied services under Part B of the IDEA\nare “otherwise qualified” to participate in school and are denied\nthat education because of their disabilities. However, children\nunder the age of three, who are covered by Part C of the IDEA,\nare not entitled to a free and appropriate education under § 612.\nMore specifically, the only reason children receiving services\nunder Part C of the IDEA are entitled to such services is by\nreason of their disability. Therefore, when an agency violates\nPart C of the IDEA, it does not use disability as a basis to deny\na child something to which he is entitled. Rather, the state\ndenies a child services to which he is entitled only because of\nhis disability but on some other basis. In this case, the reason\nthe M twins’ services fell short was not because they were\ndisabled, as is the case when children under Part B of the IDEA\nare denied the education guaranteed to non-disabled children,\nbut because the County misunderstood the concept of natural\nenvironment. While this is a violation of the IDEA, it is not a\nviolation of the RA. A plaintiff cannot make out an RA claim\nsimply by proving (1) that he was denied some service and\n(2) he is disabled. The state must have failed to provide the\nservice for the sole reason that the child is disabled. Menkowitz\nv. Pottstown Mem’l Med. Ctr., 154 F.3d 113, 124 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(holding that the disability must be the cause of the\ndiscrimination or denial of benefits or services). Because the\nMs did not establish a violation of the RA and because\n\n\n                               26\n\fattorney’s fees are not available under Part C of the IDEA, the\nDistrict Court erred when granting them attorney’s fees.11\n\n                              V.\n\n        For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the\nDistrict Court’s grant of summary judgment and award of\ncompensatory education on the Ms’ IDEA claim, but will\nreverse the District Court’s grant of summary judgment and\naward of attorney’s fees on the Ms’ RA claim and remand so\nthat the District Court may enter summary judgment in favor of\nthe County on that claim.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n        The Ms also made a claim for attorney’s fees under the\nADA. The District Court never reached that claim as it granted\nthem attorney’s fees based on the RA. However, the ADA, like\nthe RA, includes a requirement that the plaintiff be denied\nservices on the basis of his disabilities. Because we have\nalready determined that this was not the reason the M twins\nwere denied services, any claim under the ADA must also fail.\n\n                              27\n\f",

The District Court concluded that the\nDelaware County Office of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation (“the County”) had violated Part C of the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) and the\nRehabilitation Act (“RA”) by denying the Ms’ twin sons\nservices in their natural environment, and granted the Ms\ncompensatory education and attorney’s fees. The County\nappealed, claiming that the Ms did not put forth evidence\nproving that the services required under the IDEA were\n\n                                2\n\fdiscontinued for the period in question or that the services were\nnot provided in an appropriate environment, and that the Ms\nfailed to prove an RA violation. For the reasons set forth below,\nwe will affirm the District Court’s grant of summary judgment\non the IDEA claim and reverse its grant of summary judgment\non the RA claim.\n\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n        R.M. and P.M. are brothers and fraternal twins who were\nborn on November 10, 2000. The Ms are their parents. In 2002,\nboth twins were presenting with significant speech and\ncommunication delays and functioning at levels significantly\nbelow their peers. Based on these problems, the County\ndetermined that they were eligible for Early Intervention (“EI”)\nservices in accordance with Part C of the IDEA, and assembled\na team to develop an Individualized Family Service Plan\n(“IFSP”) for each boy. After it was determined that the speech\nservices the twins received were not effective in the home, the\nIFSP team determined that services could better be rendered in\na classroom-based program as the boys needed social interaction\nwith peers and adults. Therefore, the team and the parents filled\nout a “Justification for Center-Based Services” form, which\nauthorized the boys’ speech services to be provided at a center\nfor special-needs children run by the Cerebral Palsy Association\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fof Delaware County (“CADES”).1 Both parties agree that the\ncenter is a segregated environment as it does not provide\nservices for children who are not disabled.\n\n       As part of their IFSPs, both R.M. and P.M. used the\nPicture Exchange Communication System (PECS). The PECS\nprovides a way for children with speech delays to communicate\nthrough the use of icons. Both boys received year-round PECS\nservices. In March of 2003, Mrs. M. requested that the twins be\nallowed to attend a two-week PECS summer camp. The request\nwas denied and the Ms sent the twins to the camp at their own\nexpense.\n\n       In the meantime, on January 20, 2003, Mrs. M. requested\nthat the EI services which were currently provided at the\nCADES center be provided in a “typical setting.” She told the\nCounty that she had found a location, St. Faith’s, where the boys\ncould have a classroom setting that included involvement with\nnon-developmentally-delayed children. The County denied that\nrequest, stating that Delaware County could not provide that\nservice as it did not have a contract to provide services at St.\nFaith’s. Therefore, on January 22, 2003, the Ms enrolled the\ntwins at St. Faith’s at their own expense. While there is a\ndispute as to whether the boys continued receiving certain EI\nservices somewhere other than St. Faith’s, the County agrees\n\n\n       1\n       Under Part C of the IDEA, if early intervention services\nare provided outside the natural environment, an IFSP must\ninclude a justification for such a change.          34 C.F.R.\n§ 303.344(d)(ii).\n\n                               4\n\fthat it did not provide EI services at St. Faith’s between January\nand June 2003. The County’s records indicate that Mrs. M.\nrequested services at St. Faith’s on at least two other occasions,\nApril 30, 2003 and May 2, 2003. Eventually, the County sent\nsomeone to observe the boys at St. Faith’s. Mindy Glassberg,\nthe boys’ primary PECS therapist, testified that she observed the\nboys on April 28 and May 1, 2003, at Mrs. M.’s request. The\nCounty’s records indicate that it sent someone from CADES to\nobserve the boys at St. Faith’s in late May 2003. On June 5,\n2003, the County informed the Ms that the CADES observer\nbelieved that two, hour-long units per month of speech services\nwould be appropriate at St. Faith’s. While Mrs. M. had been\nhoping for more frequent services, she agreed to begin with the\ntwo hours per month. Shortly thereafter, the boys began\nreceiving EI services at St. Faith’s.\n\n        In July, 2003, the Ms requested that a new PECS\ntherapist replace Glassberg. The Ms claim that during the\ntransitional period between therapists that followed, P.M. and\nR.M. were not provided the PECS services required by their\nIFSPs. The County did not dispute that there were missing\nPECS service hours.\n\n                               B.\n\n       Based on their disputes with the County over the twins’\nEI services, the Ms brought two different due process claims\nagainst the County. Initially, after the County denied Mrs. M.’s\nrequest that it pay for her sons’ attendance at the PECS summer\ncamp, the Ms brought a due process claim against the County\nseeking compensation for the boys’ attendance. After a three-\n\n                                5\n\fday hearing (on June 10, June 25, and July 10, 2003), the\nHearing Officer determined that, while attendance at the camp\nmight be beneficial for the boys, it was not necessary. The boys\nwere making appropriate progress under their IFSPs as written\nwithout attendance at the camp. Because there was general\nagreement between the Ms and the County that the IFSPs were\nappropriate, and because there was no strong evidence\nsuggesting the boys were required to attend the camp, the\nHearing Officer denied the Ms’ claim for compensation for the\nPECS summer camp.\n\n       The Ms appealed the decision to the District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania.2 In addition to seeking\ncompensation for the twins’ attendance at summer camp, the Ms\nalso made a claim for the missing PECS service hours, which\nhad not been briefed before the Hearing Officer. The District\nCourt ruled that the County erred in failing to fund the camp for\nP.M., but not for R.M. As to the missing service hours, the\nDistrict Court found that the Ms had not exhausted their\nadministrative remedies and, therefore, dismissed the claims\nwithout prejudice so that the Ms could return for a decision at\nthe administrative level.\n\n       In January 2005, the Ms returned to the administrative\nlevel seeking compensatory education for the PECS hours that\n\n\n       2\n       By the consent of the parties, the case was transferred to\na magistrate judge, who was designated as the trial judge.\nReferences in this opinion to the District Court indicate the\nmagistrate judge, sitting by designation.\n\n                               6\n\fwere missed during the therapists’ transition and seeking relief\nbecause the twins were not provided EI services in their “natural\nenvironment” for the first five months they were at St. Faith’s.\nThe Ms also made a claim under the RA. All evidence and\nadditional briefing was to be submitted to the Hearing Officer\nby May 24, 2005. The Ms submitted a brief on May 24 and\nadditional exhibits on May 28. The County did not submit any\ninformation. Based on the evidence before her, the Hearing\nOfficer ruled as to each twin individually.\n\n        The Hearing Officer made the following findings of fact.\nShe determined that both children suffered from developmental\ndelays that resulted in their approval for EI services under the\nIDEA. Both children had speech services transferred to the\nCADES center so as to receive services in a center-based\nprogram. This was necessary because the CADES program\nmaximized interaction with peers and adults and provided a\nstructured environment in which to engage in activities with\nother children and adults. After the twins began attending St.\nFaith’s, the Ms expressed concerns that the boys were not\ninteracting at an appropriate level and requested that someone\nfrom the County come observe the boys at St. Faith’s. “It took\nat least two months for someone to observe [the twins] at St.\nFaith’s.” As to the missing PECS hours, the Hearing Officer\ndetermined that the County failed to provide approximately\nnineteen hours of PECS services to R.M. and five hours of\nPECS services to P.M.\n\n       Based on these factual findings, the Hearing Officer\nmade the same legal determinations as to each boy (except for\nfinding that each was entitled to a different number of missing\n\n                               7\n\fPECS hours). The Hearing Officer first determined that there\nwas no dispute that the boys were deprived of PECS services\nwhile they were clients of the County. Finding that the most\ncommon remedy under Part B of the IDEA for deprivation of\nservices is compensatory education, the Hearing Officer found\nthat this was also an appropriate remedy under Part C and\nordered the County to provide R.M. with seventy-seven fifteen-\nminute units of compensatory education services and to provide\nP.M. with nineteen fifteen-minute units of compensatory\neducation services.\n\n        The Hearing Officer next addressed the Ms’ natural\nenvironment claims. The Hearing Officer determined that\n“natural environment” under Part C of the IDEA included St.\nFaith’s, as it was an environment where typical, non-\ndevelopmentally-delayed children would be found. Concluding\nthat the “natural environment” requirement under Part C of the\nIDEA was analogous to the “least restrictive environment”\nrequirement under Part B of the IDEA, the Hearing Officer\nfound that it was the County’s burden to show that the twins\nwere educated in their natural environment. She found that the\nCounty had failed to show that it had provided the boys with\nservices in their natural environment. The Hearing Officer\nultimately awarded the Ms $755.50 in tuition reimbursement for\neach child for the time spent at St. Faith’s without the services,\nbut did not award compensatory education for the five months\nthat services were not provided in the natural environment.3 The\n\n\n       3\n      The Hearing Officer also determined that this kind of\ncompensatory award was appropriate under the County’s Mental\n\n                                8\n\fHearing Officer did not address the Ms’ RA claim. The County\ndid not appeal the Hearing Officer’s decision.\n\n       Following the decision, the County paid the tuition\nreimbursement ordered by the Hearing Officer, but the ordered\ncompensatory education for the missing PECS hours was not\nprovided, as the parties could not agree as to how to make up\nthose hours. After the County refused to pay attorney’s fees that\nthe Ms had requested by letter, the Ms filed a complaint in the\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on\nAugust 12, 2005.\n\n        The Ms’ complaint sought attorney’s fees under the RA,\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and § 1983, the\nrelief they were due under the Hearing Officer’s opinion, and\nadditional relief not granted by the Hearing Officer. The Ms’\ncomplaint alleged that the Hearing Officer had found in favor of\ntheir children on the natural environment claim, but did not\nprovide compensation for the services listed on the IFSP that\nwere not provided when the children were at St. Faith’s. In\naddition, the Ms maintained that § 749a(b) of the RA provided\nan additional basis for recovery, including the award of\nattorney’s fees to the prevailing party in an action under the RA.\n\n       Following service of the Complaint, the parties filed\ncross-motions for summary judgment. Based on the motions,\nthe District Court entered judgment in favor of the Ms. As to\n\n\nHealth and Mental Retardation program as part of “special\ninstruction,” which is listed as a reimbursable expense.\n\n                                9\n\fthe Ms’ claim that the Hearing Officer agreed with them on their\nnatural environment claim but failed to provide compensation,\nthe District Court agreed, finding that the services that had been\nprovided to the twins at the CADES center prior to their\nenrollment at St. Faith’s had ceased as of January 2003. “The\nCounty has not argued here, nor did they argue before the\nH[earing] O[fficer], that the prescribed services were actually\nprovided between January and June, 2003, such as if, for\nexample, the children attended both CADES and St. Faith’s at\nthe same time.” It, therefore, awarded the Ms compensatory\neducation. As to the Ms’ claim under the RA, the District Court\nsimply stated that “I have found that the Plaintiffs’ claim for five\nmonths of compensatory education for the missing supplemental\nservices was valid. As the prevailing parties in a Rehabilitation\nAct case, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorney’s fees.” 4 The\nDistrict Court found that the County could not be held liable\nunder § 1983.\n\n        Following this initial decision, entered on January 18,\n2006, the District Court allowed the parties to provide additional\nbriefing on the issue of attorney’s fees. Following the receipt of\nbriefs on the issue, the District Court again determined that the\nMs could recover attorney’s fees. While Part C of the IDEA\ndoes not provide for the recovery of attorney’s fees, the District\nCourt stated that attorney’s fees were recoverable under\n§ 749a(b) of the RA. However, the District Court ruled that the\n\n\n       4\n        The District Court also found that the Ms could recover\nunder the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12117, but found that this was\nirrelevant to its decision.\n\n                                10\n\fonly fees which were recoverable were those expended in\nbringing the appeal to the District Court and not those costs that\nresulted from bringing the claims which were successful at the\nadministrative level. The District Court therefore awarded the\nMs approximately $15,000 in attorney’s fees.\n\n       This timely appeal followed.\n\n                               II.\n\n       We have jurisdiction over the final order of the District\nCourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

Services provided under Part C include\nfamily training and counseling, physical and occupational\ntherapy, speech therapy, special instruction, and social work\nservices. 20 U.S.C. § 1432(4)(E). These services are to be\nprovided, whenever possible, in the child’s “natural\nenvironment.” Id. § 1432(4)(G). As under the better-known\nPart B of the IDEA, parents who are dissatisfied with their\ntoddler’s IFSP or services may file a due process claim against\nthe state entity responsible for providing the services. Id.\n§ 1439.\n\n       The County claims that the District Court made two\nerrors when finding in the Ms’ favor on their IDEA due process\nclaim. It argues that the District Court inappropriately put the\nburden of proof on the County, as the defendant, to prove that\nservices continued while the twins were at St. Faith’s, and that\nthe District Court improperly found that services were not\nprovided in the twins’ natural environment.\n\n\n\n                               12\n\f                                A.\n\n       The County first contends that the District Court\nimproperly placed the burden on it to prove that appropriate\nservices were provided to the twins. In its opinion, the District\nCourt stated that the County failed to prove that any services\nwere provided to the twins while they were at St. Faith’s, as\nwould have been the case if, for example, the twins had\ncontinued attending CADES in addition to St. Faith’s. This, the\nCounty argues, impermissibly required it to bear the burden of\nproving the provision of services rather than requiring the Ms to\nprove the absence of services.\n\n        We begin our analysis of the appropriate burden of proof\nwith the language of the statute. Under Part C of the IDEA, an\naggrieved party may bring an action in a district court to resolve\nits grievance:\n\n       Any party aggrieved by the findings and decision\n       regarding an administrative complaint shall have\n       the right to bring a civil action with respect to the\n       complaint in any State court of competent\n       jurisdiction or in a district court of the United\n       States without regard to the amount in\n       controversy. In any action brought under this\n       paragraph, the court shall receive the records of\n       the administrative proceedings, shall hear\n       additional evidence at the request of a party, and,\n       basing its decision on the preponderance of the\n       evidence, shall grant such relief as the court\n       determines is appropriate.\n\n                                13\n\f20 U.S.C. § 1439(a)(1).5 Section 1439 does not contain any\nindication of which party bears the burden of proof when a\nclaim is brought.\n\n        As we have no case law directing the appropriate burden\nunder Part C of the IDEA, we turn to relevant case law under\nPart B. Prior to 2005, most courts agreed that, at the due\nprocess hearing, the state or county providing services to\nindividuals eligible under the IDEA bore the burden of proving\nthat it was providing appropriate services.

The Supreme Court made very\nclear that it was speaking only of the burden of persuasion – in\nother words which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced\n– and not of the burden of production – which party bears the\nobligation to come forward with the evidence at different points\nin the proceedings. Id. at 534. Because of the presumption that\nthe plaintiff bears the burden of proving the essential elements\nof his claim, id., and finding nothing in the language of the\nIDEA to suggest otherwise, id. at 535-37, the Supreme Court\nheld that the burden of persuasion lies with the party seeking\nrelief. Id. at 537. Therefore, when the school district challenges\nan Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) under Part B, the\n\n\n       5\n        The County incorrectly cites 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2) for\nthe authorization of judicial review. Section 1415 provides the\nreview process for claims under Part B of the IDEA, which\ndeals with a free and appropriate education, not early\nintervention under Part C.\n\n                               14\n\fburden lies with it. When the parents challenge the IEP, the\nburden lies with them. We see no reason why the burden of\npersuasion would lie with a different party under Part C.\n\n        In addition to bearing the burden of persuasion, the party\nchallenging an administrative decision faces the additional\nhurdle of overcoming a presumption that the Hearing Officer’s\nfindings were correct. Although a district court may make its\nown findings of fact by a preponderance of the evidence and\nlook at evidence outside the administrative record, it is required\nto give the administrative decision “due weight.” Shore Reg’l\nHigh Sch., 381 F.3d at 199 (citing Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick\nHudson Cent.

In the case before us, these standards interact\nin an unusual fashion. In most cases under the IDEA, a party\nchallenging an administrative decision will need to challenge the\nfindings of the Hearing Officer. However, in this case, the\nHearing Officer’s factual determinations were favorable to the\nMs. It was only her failure to provide appropriate compensation\nand her failure to address the Ms’ RA claim that the Ms\nchallenged. Therefore, while the Ms bore the burden of\npersuasion at the District Court level, the County was bound by\nthe Hearing Officer’s determinations unless it could provide\nspecific evidence as to why those findings were incorrect. With\nthis in mind, we turn to the District Court’s finding regarding\nthe provision of services.\n\n                                15\n\f        In her decision, the Hearing Officer made several factual\nfindings. She determined that the twins were not provided\nservices at St. Faith’s prior to the time the County sent people to\nobserve them. “Months went by before MH/MR [the County]\neven agreed to observe [the twins] at St. Faith[’]s let alone\nprovide services there although St. Faith[’]s was [the twins’]\nnatural environment.” The District Court had to give due weight\nto that decision. However, the Hearing Officer did not explicitly\nfind that the County failed to provide services to the twins at a\nlocation other than St. Faith’s, such as CADES. Therefore, the\nDistrict Court’s statement that “[t]he County has not argued\nhere, nor did [it] argue before the H[earing] O[fficer], that the\nprescribed services were actually provided between January and\nJune, 2003, such as if, for example, the children attended both\nCADES and St. Faith’s at the same time[,]” was made based on\nits own review, not by giving due weight to the Hearing\nOfficer’s determination.\n\n       In their papers before the District Court, the Ms argued\nthat “the County failed to provide the twins with special\ninstruction for the first five months that they were in the natural\nenvironment.” They further alleged that “each twin is entitled\nto compensatory education for missing special instruction that\n[was] identified on each one’s IFSP but which [was] not\ndelivered from the point the County stopped delivering the\nservice until such time as the Team developed a new IFSP.”\n“Each twin was denied 20 hours of special instruction from\nJanuary 2003 until June 2003 – 100 hours each.” In support of\nthis contention, the Ms pointed to the fact that Mrs. M.\nrequested that services currently provided at the CADES center\nbe transferred to St. Faith’s, subsequently enrolled her children\n\n                                16\n\fin St. Faith’s, and then twice requested that services be provided\nat St. Faith’s. This, the Ms argue, allows for a reasonable\ninference that the twins were not being provided services\nanywhere. The County countered merely by stating that the Ms\ndid not provide sufficient evidence that services were not\nprovided. It never argued that services actually were provided.\nIn its opinion, the District Court faulted the County for failing\nto argue that services were provided or provide any evidence of\nthe continuation of services. The County argues that this\nimproperly shifted the burden of proof.\n\n        However, we need not decide whether under these\ncircumstances – where a party opposes summary judgment\nsimply by claiming a lack of proof rather than by disputing a\nmaterial fact – the District Court improperly placed the burden\non the defendant. The Ms did not need to prove that services\nstopped entirely in order to prove their claim.

As the Ms’\nclaim rests on the fact that services were not delivered at St.\nFaith’s, a fact the County admits, any error the District Court\n\n\n\n\n                               17\n\fmay have made by requiring the County to prove that it provided\nservices elsewhere was harmless.6\n\n                               B.\n\n        The question we are left with, then, is not whether there\nwas sufficient evidence to show that services were stopped\naltogether, but whether the District Court appropriately found\nthat the County had violated the IDEA by not providing EI to\nthe twins at St. Faith’s. In other words, we must address\nwhether St. Faith’s is the kind of natural environment\ncontemplated by the IDEA.\n\n       We again begin with the language of the statute. Part C\nof the IDEA provides money to states that “develop and\nimplement a comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary,\ninteragency system that provides early intervention services for\ninfants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.” 20\nU.S.C. § 1431(b)(1). Those services are to be provided, when\npossible, in the child’s “natural environment.” Id. § 1432(4)(G).\nThe child’s natural environment includes “the home and\n\n\n       6\n        We note that on appeal the County only claims that the\nMs failed to prove a violation of the IDEA, not that, even if they\nhad proved a violation of the IDEA, compensatory education\nwas the inappropriate remedy. Proof of a violation of Part C of\nthe IDEA does not require complete cessation of services. We\nmake no comment as to whether receiving compensatory\neducation as a remedy under Part C of the IDEA requires proof\nof the total termination of services.\n\n                               18\n\fcommunity settings in which children without disabilities\nparticipate.” 34 C.F.R. § 303.12(b). The regulations further\ndefine natural environment as “settings that are natural or\nnormal for the child’s age peers who have no disabilities.” Id.\n§ 303.18. Examples of such natural environments include “the\nhome, child care centers, or other community settings.” Id.\n§ 303.344, n. 1. If services will not be provided in a natural\nenvironment, the IFSP must include a justification. Id.\n§ 303.344(d)(a)(ii).\n\n        In the present case, the Hearing Officer determined, and\nthe District Court agreed, that the twins were denied access to\nspecial instruction in their natural environment. As the County\ndid not appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer, it appears\nthat it is bound by that decision. However, even if it was not\nbound by that legal determination, its claim would still fail. At\nthis stage, the County argues that “natural environment” does\nnot include preschools. It turns first to the language used to\ndescribe natural environment as support. Citing to Note 1 of 34\nC.F.R. § 303.344, the County states “[n]atural environments\nhave been described by the Legislature as including home, child\ncare centers and community settings, not preschools.” This\nargument reads the list of “natural environments” too narrowly.\nNote 1 to § 303.344 reads:\n\n       However, for these and other eligible children,\n       early intervention services must be provided in\n       natural environments (e.g., the home, child care\n       centers, or other community settings) to the\n       maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the\n       child.\n\n                               19\n\f34 C.F.R. § 303.344, n. 1 (emphasis added). Clearly this list of\nexamples is not exclusive, hence the “e.g.”            Natural\nenvironments can encompass more than simply homes and child\ncare centers.\n\n        In fact, the regulations define “natural environment”\nmuch more broadly than the list provided in Note 1 to\n§ 303.344. Natural environments are “settings that are natural\nor normal for the child’s age peers who have no disabilities.”\nId. § 303.18. The question is whether St. Faith’s was a normal\nsetting for a child the twins’ age without disabilities. The twins’\nIFSP team determined that both boys required “a structured\nenvironment that provides a balance of adult direction and\nchild[-]centered activities” and “modification[s] to maximize\ncommunication and interaction with peers and adults.” Parents\nlooking to encourage their non-disabled child’s interaction with\npeers and adults and engage their child in child-centered\nactivities would likely enroll their child in a day care or\npreschool. Therefore, St. Faith’s is precisely the kind of natural\nenvironment contemplated by the IDEA.7\n\n\n       7\n         The County makes a further argument that only the\ntwins’ home could be their natural environment. It argues that\nthe IFSP provided a justification for the twins’ enrollment in the\nCADES center-based program. Therefore, it argues, that must\nindicate that anything outside the home was outside the twins’\nnatural environment.       This argument is spurious.         The\njustification was required for the CADES center-based program\nbecause the center was a segregated center strictly for disabled\nchildren, which is clearly outside a setting that is natural for a\n\n                                20\n\f        The County also argues that the Hearing Officer’s\ncomparison between the “natural environment” requirement in\nPart C of the IDEA and the “least restrictive environment”\nrequirement under Part B of the IDEA was error. Under Part B\nof the IDEA, a child must be provided with educational services\nin the “least restrictive environment.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5).\nThis has often been referred to as the “mainstreaming\ncomponent” and requires that, if possible, children with\ndisabilities be educated with non-disabled children. See\nRamsey, 435 F.3d at 390. In her discussion about the natural\nenvironment, the Hearing Officer used case law on the least\nrestrictive environment as guidance, citing factors typically\nconsidered in those types of cases. We find this analogy\nappropriate and useful. The Hearing Officer did not determine\nthat a school is always the child’s natural environment, as is the\ncase with the least restrictive environment. Rather, she simply\ndetermined that the County had failed to make any showing as\nto efforts it made to provide the twins with services in their\nnatural environment or to provide them with supplemental\nservices in that environment, factors typically considered when\ndetermining if a state has provided appropriate services.8\n\n\n\nchild the twins’ age without a disability. 34 C.F.R. § 303.18.\n       8\n        At the time the Hearing Officer made her decision,\nSchaffer was not yet decided, and our leading case, Oberti v.\nBoard of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609180\"><a href=\"/opinion/609180/rafael-oberti-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-carlos-and-jeanne-oberti/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219 (3d Cir. 1993), placed\nthe burden of proof on the school district or county. Therefore,\nthe County does not argue that the Hearing Officer erred by\nplacing the burden of proof on the County at the due process\n\n                               21\n\fTherefore, her award of reimbursement did not amount to\nrequiring the County to provide the twins a free and appropriate\neducation (a requirement not included under Part C), but was\nsimply a determination that the twins’ natural environment for\nsocial interaction was a preschool and that the County failed to\nprovide them services in that natural environment. Because the\nHearing Officer and the District Court appropriately determined\nthat the twins were not provided EI services in their natural\nenvironment, the County’s argument fails.9\n\n                              IV.\n\n       The County next claims that the District Court erred by\ngranting the Ms attorney’s fees under the RA. It argues, first,\nthat the Ms failed to prove a violation of the RA, and,\nalternatively, that even if the Ms had proved a violation,\n\n\n\nhearing.\n       9\n        We note again that the County only appeals the grant of\ncompensatory education based on a claimed error in the District\nCourt’s understanding of natural environment, not on the\nDistrict Court’s choice to award compensatory education in\naddition to the tuition reimbursement provided by the Hearing\nOfficer. While reimbursement of professional (EI) services is\ncertainly proper to remedy inadequate services under Part C of\nthe IDEA, Adams v. Oregon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766693\"><a href=\"/opinion/766693/lucas-adams-by-and-through-his-parents-dave-adams-lisandra-adams-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1150 (9th Cir.\n1999), whether a parent can recover both preschool or child care\nfees in addition to early intervention services is a question we\nneed not reach today.\n\n                              22\n\fattorney’s fees are not appropriate because Part C of the IDEA\ndoes not allow such a recovery. We agree with the County that\nthe Ms failed to prove a violation of the RA.\n\n        The Ms premised their RA violation on the same facts\nused to prove their IDEA claim, namely that the County failed\nto provide services for their sons in their natural environment.\nIn its opinion, the District Court found that this was sufficient to\nprove a violation of the RA.

The\nDistrict Court was incorrect.\n\n      Our case law makes clear that a party may use the same\nconduct as the basis for claims under both the IDEA and the RA.\nIn Matula, we found that “Congress specifically intended that\n[Education of the Handicapped Act, the predecessor to the\n\n\n       10\n         We recognize that we have recently decided A.W. v.\nJersey City Pub.

However, this\nlanguage does not indicate that a violation of the IDEA is a per\nse violation of the RA, regardless of whether it meets the\nindependent requirements for an RA violation. As our case law\nindicates by citing the requirements of the RA even in cases also\nbrought under the IDEA, see Ridgewood, 172 F.3d at 253, that\na plaintiff must still prove that there was a violation of the RA.\n\n       Section 504 of the RA states:\n\n       No otherwise qualified individual with a disability\n       in the United States, as defined in section 705(20)\n       of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his\n       disability, be excluded from the participation in,\n       be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n       discrimination under any program or activity\n       receiving Federal financial assistance or under\n       any program or activity conducted by any\n       Executive agency or by the United States Postal\n       Service.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Under the regulations that accompany the\nRA, “qualified handicapped person” includes:\n\n       (2) With respect to public preschool[,]\n       elementary, secondary, or adult educational\n       services, a handicapped person (i) of an age\n       during which nonhandicapped persons are\n       provided such services, (ii) of any age during\n       which it is mandatory under state law to provide\n\n                               24\n\f       such services to handicapped persons, or (iii) to\n       whom a state is required to provide a free\n       appropriate public education under section 612 of\n       the Education of the Handicapped Act;\n\n       ...\n\n       (4) With respect to other services, a handicapped\n       person who meets the essential eligibility\n       requirements for the receipt of such services.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 104.3(l).\n\n         Based on this language, it is clear why violations of Part\nB of the IDEA are almost always violations of the RA. Under\n§ 612 of the IDEA, states accepting federal funds must provide\nchildren of a certain age a free and appropriate public education.\n20 U.S.C. § 1412. The regulations accompanying the RA adopt\nthis requirement and provide that a handicapped person is one\n“to whom a state is required to provide a free appropriate public\neducation under section 612 . . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 104.3(k).\nTherefore, when a state fails to provide a disabled child with a\nfree and appropriate education, it violates the IDEA. However,\nit also violates the RA because it is denying a disabled child a\nguaranteed education merely because of the child’s disability.\nIt is the denial of an education that is guaranteed to all children\nthat forms the basis of the claim. Therefore, a plaintiff can\nprove an RA violation where “(1) he is ‘disabled’ as defined by\nthe Act; (2) he is ‘otherwise qualified’ to participate in school\nactivities; (3) the school or the board of education receives\nfederal financial assistance; and (4) he was excluded from\n\n                                25\n\fparticipation in, denied the benefits of, or subject to\ndiscrimination at, the school.” Ridgewood, 172 F.3d at 253.\n\n        As the County argues, the analysis is not the same under\nPart C of the IDEA as it is under Part B. As we have\nestablished, children denied services under Part B of the IDEA\nare “otherwise qualified” to participate in school and are denied\nthat education because of their disabilities. However, children\nunder the age of three, who are covered by Part C of the IDEA,\nare not entitled to a free and appropriate education under § 612.\nMore specifically, the only reason children receiving services\nunder Part C of the IDEA are entitled to such services is by\nreason of their disability. Therefore, when an agency violates\nPart C of the IDEA, it does not use disability as a basis to deny\na child something to which he is entitled. Rather, the state\ndenies a child services to which he is entitled only because of\nhis disability but on some other basis. In this case, the reason\nthe M twins’ services fell short was not because they were\ndisabled, as is the case when children under Part B of the IDEA\nare denied the education guaranteed to non-disabled children,\nbut because the County misunderstood the concept of natural\nenvironment. While this is a violation of the IDEA, it is not a\nviolation of the RA. A plaintiff cannot make out an RA claim\nsimply by proving (1) that he was denied some service and\n(2) he is disabled. The state must have failed to provide the\nservice for the sole reason that the child is disabled. Menkowitz\nv. Pottstown Mem’l Med. Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757566\"><a href=\"/opinion/757566/elliot-menkowitz-md-susan-menkowitz-v-pottstown-memorial-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 124 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(holding that the disability must be the cause of the\ndiscrimination or denial of benefits or services).

The District Court never reached that claim as it granted\nthem attorney’s fees based on the RA. However, the ADA, like\nthe RA, includes a requirement that the plaintiff be denied\nservices on the basis of his disabilities. Because we have\nalready determined that this was not the reason the M twins\nwere denied services, any claim under the ADA must also fail.\n\n                              27\n\f</pre>",
