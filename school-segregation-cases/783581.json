The defendant Diehl, a McKeesport, Pennsylvania, policeman, arrived two or three minutes after the accident occurred.  He transported Polite, his two children, and a girl who had been riding in the other car, to McKeesport Hospital.  On Diehl's instructions, Polite's car was towed away by a private towing service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite was placed under arrest at the hospital on charges of driving under the influence of liquor and disorderly conduct.  Polite alleges that while he was held in custody at the police station the defendant policemen maliciously beat him and sprayed chemical mace in his eyes.  Then, Polite claims, he was taken before a magistrate and forced to plead guilty to charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver's license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law.  The following morning, after a hearing, Polite was bound over on the drunken driving charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately 23 months after Polite's arrest he filed a civil rights action against Diehl and Lofstrom.  A little less than 24 months after the arrest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> he filed another suit against Rendulic, Chancio, Hanna, Donet, Sokol and Lofstrom, alleging the same violations of his civil rights raised in the first suit.  All the defendants were McKeesport policemen.  The two actions were consolidated in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaints both alleged that the defendant policemen, 'acting in concert and under color of state law,' violated the Civil Rights Acts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in depriving Polite of due process of law and equal protection of the laws in that (1) 'Plaintiff was detained and incarcerated without a warrant, probable cause, explanation of the charges, explanation of his rights or the opportunity to consult with counsel;' (2) 'Plaintiff was subjected to verbal abuse and taunting (and) . . . physical abuse by the defendants in that he was repeatedly beaten, kicked, punched and while imprisoned in a cell was subjected to the application of liquid chemical mace to the eyes, all of which caused serious and severe injuries to the plaintiff,' and 'denied medical attention for the injuries received in the beatings administered by the defendants;' (3) 'By the use of threats, intimidation and interrogation was forced by the defendants to plead guilty to the charges alleged;' and (4) 'At the time of the collision the defendants, without explanation, unlawfully seized the plaintiff's vehicle.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants denied the allegations in Polite's complaints, and then filed a motion for summary judgment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on the ground that Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations for actions based on false arrest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> barred plaintiff's suits.  Polite, in reply, contended that the appropriate statute of limitations was Pennsylvania's two-year statute pertaining to suits for personal injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing on defendants' motion for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment in favor of the defendants in both actions.  The district court construed Gagliardi v. Lynn,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the leading case on the scope of Pennsylvania's statute of limitations for false arrest actions, as holding that that statute 'applies to the entire course of conduct in cases involving incarceration preceded by arrest, including any incidental assault and battery.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Applying the one-year false arrest statute of limitations to the entirety of Polite's complaints, the district court granted defendants' motions since more than a year had elapsed between the alleged violations of Polite's rights and the filing of the actions.  These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite contends that the district court should have applied Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations pertaining to personal injury actions instead of the one-year statute of limitations relating to actions for false arrest.  Although Polite has not challenged the district court's application of a single statute of limitations to the numerous claims raised in his complaints, we must determine whether the district court should have applied a separate statute to each cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly applied the one-year statute of limitations to Polite's allegations of an unlawful arrest, but it erred in holding that the one-year statute extended to the assault and battery, conversion and guilty plea aspects of his actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Civil Rights Acts contain no statute of limitations, the limitation to be applied is that which would be applicable in the courts of the state in which the federal court is sitting had an action seeking similar relief been brought under state law.  Henig v. Odorioso, 385 F.2d 491 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied 390 U.S. 1016, 88 S.Ct. 1269, 20 L.Ed.2d 166 (1968).  Consequently, this Court has held that Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations pertaining to suits for false arrest is applicable to federal civil rights actions for a false arrest allegedly committed in Pennsylvania.  Hileman v. Kanble, 391 F.wd 596 (3d Cir. 1968); Henig v. Odorioso, supra.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the bar of Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations to the unlawful arrest aspect of Polite's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gagliardi, supra, however, affords no support for the view, adopted by the district court, that the limitations statute applicable to actions for false arrest 'applies to the entire course of conduct in cases involving incarceration preceded by arrest, including any incidental assault and battery.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In Gagliardi, the only issue was whether the trial court erred in holding that the one-year false arrest statute barred an action for false imprisonment.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in affirming, stated that 'confinement is inextricably intertwined with an unlawful arrest,' and 'By the same token, if the false arrest involved only a touching and no confinement, and we were forced to choose between limitation statutes relating to false arrest and battery, we would opt for the former.'  446 Pa. at 150, 285 A.2d at 112.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside the fact that the latter statement was dictum, the language quoted refers only to a 'touching' or battery committed in accomplishing an arrest.  The assault alleged here occurred not when the plaintiff was arrested at the hospital, but considerably later while he was being held in the police station.  Therefore, since the alleged assault and battery was not 'inextricably intertwined' with the alleged false arrest, plaintiff's cause of action for assault and battery would not, under Pennsylvania law, be subsumed under the one-year statute applicable to suits for false arrest.  Rather, if plaintiff had brought an analogous action in state court, that court would have applied Pennsylvania's two-year personal injury statute to the assault and battery.  The district court here, therefore, must do the same.  Thomas v. Howard, 455 F.2d 228 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed plaintiff's allegations of a coerced guilty plea and the illegal seizure of plaintiff's automobile on the basis of the one-year false arrest statute of limitations.  What has been said with regard to the assault and battery allegations demonstrates that the district court erred in doing so, since that alleged conduct was separable from the false arrest.  The Pennsylvania statute of limitations applicable to state suits analogous to the allegation of the unlawful seizure of plaintiff's automobile is the six-year statute for actions for the recovery of goods.  The state cause of action most similar to plaintiff's allegation of a guilty plea coerced by physical abuse is one for wrongful personal injury not resulting in death, to which a two-year statute is applicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The trial court therefore erred in summarily disposing of these two causes of action on the basis of the one-year false arrest statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties to this appeal contend that plaintiff's entire complaint should be governed by a single limitations statute.  Such a ruling, however, would be contrary to the holdings in Henig, supra, and Thomas, supra, that the district court must apply the same statute of limitations that a state court would apply in a state action seeking similar relief.  Moreover, applying a single statute would have an anamalous result, since joining a claim for unlawful arrest with one for 'police brutality' would either extend the statute which would be applicable to the unlawful arrest or contract the statute that would be applicable to the brutality claim if plaintiff had raised only one of the claims or had raised them in separate actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that the defendants filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment on the basis that the record contained no evidence to sustain plaintiff's allegations of a coerced guilty plea or of an unlawful seizure of his automobile.  Although the record in its present state may not contain sufficient averments to withstand such a motion, since there is no indication in the record that this motion was considered by or pressed in the district court and since the parties may wish to present additional facts when the question is squarely addressed, we leave that issue to be resolved upon remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' motions for summary judgment did not specifically raise the question whether the alleged assault, as described in the depositions, constituted grounds for relief under section 1983, nor did the briefs on this appeal deal with the issue, except in a fleeting reference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Consequently, it would appear premature to address it at this time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment for the defendants on the causes of action alleging false arrest will be affirmed, but the judgment on the causes of action alleging assault and battery, a coerced guilty plea and unlawful seizure of the automobile will be reversed, and the case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KALODNER, Circuit Judge (concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with the majority's holding that the district court correctly applied Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations to Polite's false arrest claims but erred in applying that statute to the assault and battery, conversion and guilty plea aspects of Polite's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I further agree with the majority's affirmance of the Order of the district court insofar as it granted summary judgment for the defendants with respect to Polite's false arrest claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent, however, from the reversal of the Order insofar as it granted summary judgment for the defendants as to Polite's assault and battery, coerced guilty plea, and automobile conversion claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority has taken a short cut to error in its stated reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical threshold question by these appeals may be epitomized as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Are Fourteenth Amendment rights violated when a policeman's fists give a 'black eye'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> to one under arrest; otherwise stated, is infliction of a 'black eye' a 'federal case'?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question was raised in the district court by the defendants' 'supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment' following filing of record of Polite's Deposition and his 'Pre-Trial Narrative Statement,' and its annexed 'Medical Report,' which disclosed nothing more than alleged infliction of a 'black eye' of five days' duration by the bare fists of one of the defendant-policemen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority has decided to eschew deciding upon the threshold question and to 'leave that issue to be resolved upon remand' on its reasoning that 'it would appear premature to address it at this time,' because, in its view, 'there is no indication in the record that this motion was considered by or pressed in the district court'; and 'defendants' motions for summary judgment did not specifically raise the question whether the alleged assault, as described in the depositions, constituted grounds for relief under section 1983, nor did the briefs on this appeal deal with the issue, except in a fleeting reference.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree with the majority's stated views in every respect.  Polite's Complaints alleged violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights and sequential applicability of 1983, and the defendants' Answers denied violation of 'any' constitutional rights.  The applicability of 1983 was squarely presented here by the briefs of Polite and the defendants.  The defendants' brief specifically urged that 'the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action under the Civil Rights Act.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority has not served the judicial economy in limiting its disposition to the statutory limitations issue presented by the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and eschewing the substantive issue as to applicability of 1983 raised by the defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstance that the district court did not decide the threshold question presented by the Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment is of no for Summary Judgment is of no consequence.  Nor is it of critical significance that the district court erred in premising its grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to Polite's assault and battery and conversion allegations on Pennsylvania's one-year false arrest statute of limitations.  It is settled that an appeal brings up the ultimate question whether a judgment below is right or wrong, and an appellate court may affirm the judgment if found to be correct, although based on incorrect reasoning.  United States v. Rose, 346 F.2d 985, 989 (3d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 979, 86 S.Ct. 551, 15 L.Ed.2d 469 (1966).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts giving rise to plaintiff's actions may be highlighted as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of August 17, 1969, at about 6:30 p.m., an automobile operated by Polite, in which his two young children were passengers, ploughed into the rear of an automobile which had stopped at an intersection in compliance with a 'Stop' warning sign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant Diehl, a McKeesport, Pennsylvania policeman, arrived at the scene of the accident two or three minutes after it occurred.  He transported Polite, his two children, and a girl who had been riding in the struck car, to McKeesport Hospital.  One of Polite's children was then suffering from a bleeding nose occasioned by the collision.  Polite's car, which had sustained a smashed radiator, was towed away by a private towing service on Diehl's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite was placed under arrest at the hospital for alleged driving under the influence of liquor and disorderly conduct.  He was taken to the police station about 7 p.m.  He was given a hearing before a magistrate several hours later on charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver's license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law.  The magistrate fined Polite $205.00 and imposed costs of $15.00.  Polite paid the fines and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite was given a hearing on the drunken driving charge the next morning before the same magistrate.

The grand jury later failed to indict Polite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 8, 1971, Polite filed a civil rights action against the defendants at Appeal No. 72-1770.  He filed his action on August 11, 1971 against the defendant policemen at Appeal No. 72-2013.  The first action came almost 23 months after Polite's arrest on August 17, 1969; the second action almost two years later.

The 1871 Act is commonly referred to as the Ku Klux Klan Act because it was spawned by Ku Klux Klan unconscionable outrages inflicted upon black citizens and Union sympathizers in the post-Civil War era, unrestrained by state law enforcement agencies and courts which were unwilling or unable to cope with Klan outlawry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The historic background of the 1871 Act was outlined in the leading case of Monroe v.

There was available to the Congress during these debates a report, nearly 600 pages in length, dealing with the activities of the Klan and the inability of the state governments to cope with it.  This report was drawn on by many of the speakers.

It was 'modeled' on 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, and was enacted for the express purpose of 'enforcing the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.' 17 Stat. 13.  The predecessor of 1983 was thus an important part of the basic alteration in our federal system wrought in the Reconstruction era through federal legislation and constitutional amendment.  As a result of the new structure of law that emerged in the post-Civil War era-- and especially of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was its centerpiece-- the role of the Federal Government as a guarantor of basic federal rights against state power was clearly established.  . . .  Section 1983 opened the federal courts to private citizens, offering a uniquely federal remedy against incursions under the claimed authority of state law upon rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the Nation.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has specifically held that 1983, like the Fourteenth Amendment which is its centerpiece, 'is of only limited scope' reaching only 'deprivations of rights' under color of state law and not 'purely private conduct.'  In doing so, it said in District of Columbia v. Carter, supra, 409 U.S. at pages 424-425, 93 S.Ct. at page 606:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Like the Amendment upon which it based, 1983 is of only limited scope.  The statute deals only with those deprivations of rights that are accomplished under the color of the law of 'any State or Territory.'  It does not reach purely private conduct and, with the exception of the Territories, actions of the Federal Government and its officers are at least facially exempt from its proscriptions.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has taken cognizance of the limited scope of 1983, in holding that improper medical treatment of a state prisoner is not a deprivation of fundamental rights secured by the federal Constitution and laws,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> and that the same is true with respect to a denial to a state prisoner of necessary medical treatment for an ear infection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a>  We have further ruled that a state prisoner's complaint which alleged that he was compelled to work on a press which was dangerous and unfit, failed to state a 1983 cause of action.  In doing so we held that a tort committed by a state official acting under color of state law is not 'in and of itself, sufficient to show an invasion of a person's right under the (1983) Act.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale of our stated view was later explicated in Howell v.

The two rights of action do not always stand in pari materia.  Some common law and statutory torts, although actionable in a state forum, although actionable in a state forum, do not rise to constitutional dimensions.  The converse is equally true. Conduct may be actionable as a deprivation of constitutional rights where no force and violence has been utilized, and there exists no orthodox counterpart of state common law or statutory relief available.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasized that 'recovery under 1983 is strictly limited to deprivations under the federal constitution and federal law,' in Smith v.

Simply stated, infliction of a black eye on one in custody by a policeman's fists, standing alone, is not a 'federal case.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled that while pleadings are to be liberally construed in favor of the party against whom the summary judgment motion is made, their conclusionary allegations, standing alone, do not create an issue of fact, and that courts in determining whether there is a bona fide dispute as to a material fact must consider, along with the complaints, depositions, affidavits, answers to interrogatories and requests for admissions, of record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The (summary) judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Advisory Committee on the 1963 Amendment to Rule 56(c), 28 U.S.C.A., stated in its Notes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The very mission of the summary judgment procedure is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cited and applied the foregoing epitomization of the 'mission' of the summary judgment rule in Robin Construction Company v.

Polite's Complaints after alleging that Lofstrom 'was at all times relevant hereto the Chief of Police of the City of McKeesport Police Department,' further alleged that the defendant McKeesport policemen were 'at all times acting as the servants, employees, co-conspirators, and agents of the defendant, Walter Lofstrom.'  Polite's Deposition is bare of any reference to Lofstrom's knowledge of, or participation in, the events which premise his actions.  Polite's brief on this appeal clearly indicates that Lofstrom has been joined as a defendant under the doctrine of 'respondeat superior.'  It is settled that conclusionary allegations in a complaint alleging Civil Rights Act violations will not survive a motion to dismiss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  It is further settled that an action is not maintainable against a police chief under the respondeat superior theory where he was not present, did not participate in, or have knowledge of, any civil rights violation.  Jennings v. Davis, 476 F.2d 1271, 1274 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as to the reversal of the summary judgment in favor of Diehl at Appeal No. 72-1770:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite in his Deposition completely absolved Diehl of any participation in the alleged assault incident.  He testified therein that Diehl was 'standing by that rail'; that 'he didn't' hit him; 'he didn't' hold him during the alleged assault, and that 'he did not' spray any mace upon him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the majority's reversal of the summary judgments insofar as they concern the alleged 'unlawful seizure' of Polite's car, can only be categorized as a judicial 'sport.'  Polite's Deposition shows that his automobile was badly damaged when it was ordered towed away by officer Diehl and that he had to pay a $500 repair bill for a 'new bumper, radiator and I think a fender.'  All that needs to be said with respect to this aspect of the majority's disposition is that there is no 'wrongful deprivation of property . . . under color of state law' when a policeman orders an automobile with a smashed radiator towed away while he takes its operator and passengers to a hospital, and the car is returned to its owner the next morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, assuming arguendo, that infliction of a 'black eye' on one in custody by a policeman's fists presents a 1983 case, Polite's Deposition only charged officer Rendulic with an assault.  Failure of Polite in his Deposition to name any of the other policemen defendants as participating in the assault requires entry of summary judgment in their favor under our holding is Howell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272 (1964), as spelled out at Note 23.  It is to be further noted on this score that Polite's Complaints contained only general allegations that he was 'subjected to physical abuse by the defendants' without designating any of them by name.  As stated in Note 23, we have time and again ruled that conclusory allegations of this nature require dismissal of a complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the 'coerced guilty plea,' the deposition of Kenneth J. Carroll, custodian of records of the McKeesport Police Department, taken by Polite and filed of record, disclosed that Polite entered a 'Plea of N.G.  (not guilty)' at the Sunday night hearing at which he was fined for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver's license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Polite was arrested on August 17, 1969.

Plaintiff's causes of action are then formulated under 42 U.S.C. 1981 (1974) and 42 U.S.C. 1985 (1974).  The district court, apparently giving the complaints a broad reading, disposed of both of them under section 1983.  Polite v. Diehl, Civ. Nos. 71-637; 71-760 (W.D. Pa., July 7, 1972)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Depositions had been taken of Diehl, Polite, the driver and passenger in the other car involved in the accident and the custodian of the records of the McKeesport Police Department.  Polite had also filed an ophthalmologist's report.  The defendants later filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment on the ground that the record contained no support for plaintiff's allegations 'exclusive of false imprisonment, false arrest and assault and battery.'  (Appendix at 21a) The district court, in light of its disposition of the preceding motion for summary judgment, did not act on the supplemental motion for summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 12, 51: 'Every suit to recover damages for malicious prosecution or false arrest . . . must be brought within one year from the date of the accruing of such right of action, and not thereafter: . . .'</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 12, 34:</p>\n        <p>'Every suit hereafter brought to recover damages for injury wrongfully done to the person, in case where the injury does not result in death, must be brought within two years from the time when the injury was done and not afterwards; . . .'</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> 446 Pa. 144, 285 A.2d 109 (1971)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Polite, supra, at 3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Polite, supra, at 3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> See fn. 6</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Smith v. Cremins, 308 F.2d 187, 190 (9th Cir. 1962), adverted to the possible difficulties resulting from applying a separate statute of limitations to each constitutional violation alleged in a Section 1983 suit.  There, however, the court was dealing with a single act by the defendant which violated several of plaintiff's constitutional rights.  In the present case, however, the district court was dealing with separate acts where the alleged constitutional deprivations were not 'inextricably intertwined.'  Moreover, the statutory framework in Smith was different from that here.  The Smith court was faced with a choice between separate limitation statutes applicable to each analogous common law tort and a broad statute applicable to any 'liability created by statute.'  The court decided that the broad statute was applicable.  No such broad statute of limitations is available under Pennsylvania law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> It has been asserted that the matter has been settled by this Court in Curtis v.

The defendant Diehl, a McKeesport, Pennsylvania, policeman, arrived two or three minutes after the accident occurred.  He transported Polite, his two children, and a girl who had been riding in the other car, to McKeesport Hospital.  On Diehl's instructions, Polite's car was towed away by a private towing service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite was placed under arrest at the hospital on charges of driving under the influence of liquor and disorderly conduct.  Polite alleges that while he was held in custody at the police station the defendant policemen maliciously beat him and sprayed chemical mace in his eyes.  Then, Polite claims, he was taken before a magistrate and forced to plead guilty to charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver's license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law.  The following morning, after a hearing, Polite was bound over on the drunken driving charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately 23 months after Polite's arrest he filed a civil rights action against Diehl and Lofstrom.  A little less than 24 months after the arrest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> he filed another suit against Rendulic, Chancio, Hanna, Donet, Sokol and Lofstrom, alleging the same violations of his civil rights raised in the first suit.  All the defendants were McKeesport policemen.  The two actions were consolidated in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaints both alleged that the defendant policemen, 'acting in concert and under color of state law,' violated the Civil Rights Acts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in depriving Polite of due process of law and equal protection of the laws in that (1) 'Plaintiff was detained and incarcerated without a warrant, probable cause, explanation of the charges, explanation of his rights or the opportunity to consult with counsel;' (2) 'Plaintiff was subjected to verbal abuse and taunting (and) . . . physical abuse by the defendants in that he was repeatedly beaten, kicked, punched and while imprisoned in a cell was subjected to the application of liquid chemical mace to the eyes, all of which caused serious and severe injuries to the plaintiff,' and 'denied medical attention for the injuries received in the beatings administered by the defendants;' (3) 'By the use of threats, intimidation and interrogation was forced by the defendants to plead guilty to the charges alleged;' and (4) 'At the time of the collision the defendants, without explanation, unlawfully seized the plaintiff's vehicle.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants denied the allegations in Polite's complaints, and then filed a motion for summary judgment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on the ground that Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations for actions based on false arrest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> barred plaintiff's suits.  Polite, in reply, contended that the appropriate statute of limitations was Pennsylvania's two-year statute pertaining to suits for personal injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing on defendants' motion for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment in favor of the defendants in both actions.  The district court construed Gagliardi v. Lynn,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the leading case on the scope of Pennsylvania's statute of limitations for false arrest actions, as holding that that statute 'applies to the entire course of conduct in cases involving incarceration preceded by arrest, including any incidental assault and battery.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Applying the one-year false arrest statute of limitations to the entirety of Polite's complaints, the district court granted defendants' motions since more than a year had elapsed between the alleged violations of Polite's rights and the filing of the actions.  These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite contends that the district court should have applied Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations pertaining to personal injury actions instead of the one-year statute of limitations relating to actions for false arrest.  Although Polite has not challenged the district court's application of a single statute of limitations to the numerous claims raised in his complaints, we must determine whether the district court should have applied a separate statute to each cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly applied the one-year statute of limitations to Polite's allegations of an unlawful arrest, but it erred in holding that the one-year statute extended to the assault and battery, conversion and guilty plea aspects of his actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Civil Rights Acts contain no statute of limitations, the limitation to be applied is that which would be applicable in the courts of the state in which the federal court is sitting had an action seeking similar relief been brought under state law.  Henig v. Odorioso, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"277803\"><a href=\"/opinion/277803/aileen-henig-a-minor-together-with-ludwig-henig-and-geneva-m-henig-her/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1967), cert. denied <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></span> (1968).  Consequently, this Court has held that Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations pertaining to suits for false arrest is applicable to federal civil rights actions for a false arrest allegedly committed in Pennsylvania.  Hileman v. Kanble, 391 F.wd 596 (3d Cir. 1968); Henig v. Odorioso, supra.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the bar of Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations to the unlawful arrest aspect of Polite's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gagliardi, supra, however, affords no support for the view, adopted by the district court, that the limitations statute applicable to actions for false arrest 'applies to the entire course of conduct in cases involving incarceration preceded by arrest, including any incidental assault and battery.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In Gagliardi, the only issue was whether the trial court erred in holding that the one-year false arrest statute barred an action for false imprisonment.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in affirming, stated that 'confinement is inextricably intertwined with an unlawful arrest,' and 'By the same token, if the false arrest involved only a touching and no confinement, and we were forced to choose between limitation statutes relating to false arrest and battery, we would opt for the former.'  446 Pa. at 150, 285 A.2d at 112.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside the fact that the latter statement was dictum, the language quoted refers only to a 'touching' or battery committed in accomplishing an arrest.  The assault alleged here occurred not when the plaintiff was arrested at the hospital, but considerably later while he was being held in the police station.  Therefore, since the alleged assault and battery was not 'inextricably intertwined' with the alleged false arrest, plaintiff's cause of action for assault and battery would not, under Pennsylvania law, be subsumed under the one-year statute applicable to suits for false arrest.  Rather, if plaintiff had brought an analogous action in state court, that court would have applied Pennsylvania's two-year personal injury statute to the assault and battery.  The district court here, therefore, must do the same.  Thomas v. Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"301392\"><a href=\"/opinion/301392/john-charles-thomas-v-harry-r-howard-esquire/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed plaintiff's allegations of a coerced guilty plea and the illegal seizure of plaintiff's automobile on the basis of the one-year false arrest statute of limitations.  What has been said with regard to the assault and battery allegations demonstrates that the district court erred in doing so, since that alleged conduct was separable from the false arrest.  The Pennsylvania statute of limitations applicable to state suits analogous to the allegation of the unlawful seizure of plaintiff's automobile is the six-year statute for actions for the recovery of goods.  The state cause of action most similar to plaintiff's allegation of a guilty plea coerced by physical abuse is one for wrongful personal injury not resulting in death, to which a two-year statute is applicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The trial court therefore erred in summarily disposing of these two causes of action on the basis of the one-year false arrest statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties to this appeal contend that plaintiff's entire complaint should be governed by a single limitations statute.  Such a ruling, however, would be contrary to the holdings in Henig, supra, and Thomas, supra, that the district court must apply the same statute of limitations that a state court would apply in a state action seeking similar relief.  Moreover, applying a single statute would have an anamalous result, since joining a claim for unlawful arrest with one for 'police brutality' would either extend the statute which would be applicable to the unlawful arrest or contract the statute that would be applicable to the brutality claim if plaintiff had raised only one of the claims or had raised them in separate actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that the defendants filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment on the basis that the record contained no evidence to sustain plaintiff's allegations of a coerced guilty plea or of an unlawful seizure of his automobile.  Although the record in its present state may not contain sufficient averments to withstand such a motion, since there is no indication in the record that this motion was considered by or pressed in the district court and since the parties may wish to present additional facts when the question is squarely addressed, we leave that issue to be resolved upon remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' motions for summary judgment did not specifically raise the question whether the alleged assault, as described in the depositions, constituted grounds for relief under section 1983, nor did the briefs on this appeal deal with the issue, except in a fleeting reference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Consequently, it would appear premature to address it at this time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment for the defendants on the causes of action alleging false arrest will be affirmed, but the judgment on the causes of action alleging assault and battery, a coerced guilty plea and unlawful seizure of the automobile will be reversed, and the case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KALODNER, Circuit Judge (concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with the majority's holding that the district court correctly applied Pennsylvania's one-year statute of limitations to Polite's false arrest claims but erred in applying that statute to the assault and battery, conversion and guilty plea aspects of Polite's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I further agree with the majority's affirmance of the Order of the district court insofar as it granted summary judgment for the defendants with respect to Polite's false arrest claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I dissent, however, from the reversal of the Order insofar as it granted summary judgment for the defendants as to Polite's assault and battery, coerced guilty plea, and automobile conversion claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority has taken a short cut to error in its stated reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical threshold question by these appeals may be epitomized as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Are Fourteenth Amendment rights violated when a policeman's fists give a 'black eye'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> to one under arrest; otherwise stated, is infliction of a 'black eye' a 'federal case'?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question was raised in the district court by the defendants' 'supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment' following filing of record of Polite's Deposition and his 'Pre-Trial Narrative Statement,' and its annexed 'Medical Report,' which disclosed nothing more than alleged infliction of a 'black eye' of five days' duration by the bare fists of one of the defendant-policemen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority has decided to eschew deciding upon the threshold question and to 'leave that issue to be resolved upon remand' on its reasoning that 'it would appear premature to address it at this time,' because, in its view, 'there is no indication in the record that this motion was considered by or pressed in the district court'; and 'defendants' motions for summary judgment did not specifically raise the question whether the alleged assault, as described in the depositions, constituted grounds for relief under section 1983, nor did the briefs on this appeal deal with the issue, except in a fleeting reference.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree with the majority's stated views in every respect.  Polite's Complaints alleged violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights and sequential applicability of 1983, and the defendants' Answers denied violation of 'any' constitutional rights.  The applicability of 1983 was squarely presented here by the briefs of Polite and the defendants.  The defendants' brief specifically urged that 'the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action under the Civil Rights Act.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority has not served the judicial economy in limiting its disposition to the statutory limitations issue presented by the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and eschewing the substantive issue as to applicability of 1983 raised by the defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstance that the district court did not decide the threshold question presented by the Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment is of no for Summary Judgment is of no consequence.  Nor is it of critical significance that the district court erred in premising its grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to Polite's assault and battery and conversion allegations on Pennsylvania's one-year false arrest statute of limitations.  It is settled that an appeal brings up the ultimate question whether a judgment below is right or wrong, and an appellate court may affirm the judgment if found to be correct, although based on incorrect reasoning.

He transported Polite, his two children, and a girl who had been riding in the struck car, to McKeesport Hospital.  One of Polite's children was then suffering from a bleeding nose occasioned by the collision.  Polite's car, which had sustained a smashed radiator, was towed away by a private towing service on Diehl's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite was placed under arrest at the hospital for alleged driving under the influence of liquor and disorderly conduct.  He was taken to the police station about 7 p.m.  He was given a hearing before a magistrate several hours later on charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver's license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law.  The magistrate fined Polite $205.00 and imposed costs of $15.00.  Polite paid the fines and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite was given a hearing on the drunken driving charge the next morning before the same magistrate.

The grand jury later failed to indict Polite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 8, 1971, Polite filed a civil rights action against the defendants at Appeal No. 72-1770.  He filed his action on August 11, 1971 against the defendant policemen at Appeal No. 72-2013.  The first action came almost 23 months after Polite's arrest on August 17, 1969; the second action almost two years later.

He told Dr. Grana that 'he was struck in left eye (Sunday evening 8-17-69 by a policeman).'  Polite's left eye was 'swollen shut.'  Dr. Grana's diagnosis was 'Edema<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> left upper eye lid and left lower eye lid (Moderate).'  X-rays taken at Braddock General Hospital on August 19, 1969 were 'negative for fracture.'  'Ocular examination to determine extent of injury' resulted in 'Findings normal.'  'Eye drops' were prescribed.  Polite was 'discharged' August 23, 1969, with notation-- 'Eye healed-- no complications.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 'Medical Report' concluded with these statements: 'Cost of medical treatment to date $27.00.  Estimated cost of future medical treatment None.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be noted parenthetically that Polite stated in his filed deposition that he had not seen any physician following his discharge by Dr. Grana, and that 'Plaintiff's Pre-Trial Narrative Statement' lists as sole medical expenses Dr. Grana's fee of $27.00 and $15.00 paid to Braddock General Hospital for X-rays.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite's deposition, insofar as it related to his allegations that he 'was subjected to physical abuse by the defendants . . . and to the application of liquid chemical mace to the eyes,'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> may be summarized as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He was struck and knocked down by officer Rendulic while he was in the police station; Rendulic and other unidentified policemen dragged him to a cell where Rendulic 'sprayed mace in my eyes' and 'hit me in my eyes'; Polite's face was not bruised, there was 'just swelling'; Rendulic only used 'his fists'; 'he didn't hit me with any club or blackjack . . . or gun or anything'; Rendulic did not 'kick' him; officer Diehl 'didn't' hit Polite, nor use mace on him, nor hold him while he was being hit by Rendulic; Polite didn't identify the officers who allegedly held him while he was being attacked by Rendulic, nor did he say that any other policeman had struck him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distilled essence of Polite's deposition testimony is that Rendulic, using only his fists, 'hit me in my eyes,' and 'sprayed mace in my eyes.'  The distilled essence of Dr. Grana's Medical Report is that Polite suffered a commonplace balck eye which completely healed in five days after application of eye drops.  Taken together they make out a case of 'simple battery' which is defined as 'Any unlawful beating, or other wrongful physical violence or constraint, inflicted on a human being without his consent . . . not accompanied by circumstances of aggravation, or not resulting in grievous bodily injury.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I am of the opinion that standing alone, an ordinary assault and battery committed by a policeman upon one under arrest does not violate Fourteenth Amendment guarantees,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> and thus does not bring into play the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. 1983, which affords the remedy of an action at law, or suit in equity, for 'deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and (the) laws,'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> or 28 U.S.C.A. 1343(3) which creates federal jurisdiction as to civil actions 'To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, . . . of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons . . ..'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here Polite's complaints alleged only that 'he was subjected to verbal abuse and taunting . . .

The complaints did not allege that the 'physical abuse' was administered by the defendants (1) in the course of performance of their official duties; or (2) as summary punishment in lieu of regular procedures of trial and sentence; or (3) that the alleged physical abuse amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishments' proscribed by the Eighth Amendment; or (4) that it was 'discriminatory.'  The complaints state only conclusionary allegations of constitutional violations under color of state law, viz., deprivation of 'the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite's theory of his case is epitomized in 'Plaintiff's Pre-Trial Narrative Statement' as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'During the course of his detention, the plaintiff was subjected to verbal abuse and taunting by the individual defendants.

The 1871 Act is commonly referred to as the Ku Klux Klan Act because it was spawned by Ku Klux Klan unconscionable outrages inflicted upon black citizens and Union sympathizers in the post-Civil War era, unrestrained by state law enforcement agencies and courts which were unwilling or unable to cope with Klan outlawry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The historic background of the 1871 Act was outlined in the leading case of Monroe v.

There was available to the Congress during these debates a report, nearly 600 pages in length, dealing with the activities of the Klan and the inability of the state governments to cope with it.

It was 'modeled' on 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, and was enacted for the express purpose of 'enforcing the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.' 17 Stat. 13.  The predecessor of 1983 was thus an important part of the basic alteration in our federal system wrought in the Reconstruction era through federal legislation and constitutional amendment.  As a result of the new structure of law that emerged in the post-Civil War era-- and especially of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was its centerpiece-- the role of the Federal Government as a guarantor of basic federal rights against state power was clearly established.  . . .  Section 1983 opened the federal courts to private citizens, offering a uniquely federal remedy against incursions under the claimed authority of state law upon rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the Nation.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has specifically held that 1983, like the Fourteenth Amendment which is its centerpiece, 'is of only limited scope' reaching only 'deprivations of rights' under color of state law and not 'purely private conduct.'  In doing so, it said in District of Columbia v. Carter, supra, 409 U.S. at pages 424-425, 93 S.Ct. at page 606:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Like the Amendment upon which it based, 1983 is of only limited scope.  The statute deals only with those deprivations of rights that are accomplished under the color of the law of 'any State or Territory.'  It does not reach purely private conduct and, with the exception of the Territories, actions of the Federal Government and its officers are at least facially exempt from its proscriptions.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has taken cognizance of the limited scope of 1983, in holding that improper medical treatment of a state prisoner is not a deprivation of fundamental rights secured by the federal Constitution and laws,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> and that the same is true with respect to a denial to a state prisoner of necessary medical treatment for an ear infection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a>  We have further ruled that a state prisoner's complaint which alleged that he was compelled to work on a press which was dangerous and unfit, failed to state a 1983 cause of action.  In doing so we held that a tort committed by a state official acting under color of state law is not 'in and of itself, sufficient to show an invasion of a person's right under the (1983) Act.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale of our stated view was later explicated in Howell v.

The two rights of action do not always stand in pari materia.  Some common law and statutory torts, although actionable in a state forum, although actionable in a state forum, do not rise to constitutional dimensions.  The converse is equally true. Conduct may be actionable as a deprivation of constitutional rights where no force and violence has been utilized, and there exists no orthodox counterpart of state common law or statutory relief available.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasized that 'recovery under 1983 is strictly limited to deprivations under the federal constitution and federal law,' in Smith v.

Polite's Complaints after alleging that Lofstrom 'was at all times relevant hereto the Chief of Police of the City of McKeesport Police Department,' further alleged that the defendant McKeesport policemen were 'at all times acting as the servants, employees, co-conspirators, and agents of the defendant, Walter Lofstrom.'  Polite's Deposition is bare of any reference to Lofstrom's knowledge of, or participation in, the events which premise his actions.  Polite's brief on this appeal clearly indicates that Lofstrom has been joined as a defendant under the doctrine of 'respondeat superior.'  It is settled that conclusionary allegations in a complaint alleging Civil Rights Act violations will not survive a motion to dismiss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  It is further settled that an action is not maintainable against a police chief under the respondeat superior theory where he was not present, did not participate in, or have knowledge of, any civil rights violation.  Jennings v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"310309\"><a href=\"/opinion/310309/betsy-a-jennings-v-ilus-w-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1274 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as to the reversal of the summary judgment in favor of Diehl at Appeal No. 72-1770:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Polite in his Deposition completely absolved Diehl of any participation in the alleged assault incident.  He testified therein that Diehl was 'standing by that rail'; that 'he didn't' hit him; 'he didn't' hold him during the alleged assault, and that 'he did not' spray any mace upon him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the majority's reversal of the summary judgments insofar as they concern the alleged 'unlawful seizure' of Polite's car, can only be categorized as a judicial 'sport.'  Polite's Deposition shows that his automobile was badly damaged when it was ordered towed away by officer Diehl and that he had to pay a $500 repair bill for a 'new bumper, radiator and I think a fender.'  All that needs to be said with respect to this aspect of the majority's disposition is that there is no 'wrongful deprivation of property . . . under color of state law' when a policeman orders an automobile with a smashed radiator towed away while he takes its operator and passengers to a hospital, and the car is returned to its owner the next morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, assuming arguendo, that infliction of a 'black eye' on one in custody by a policeman's fists presents a 1983 case, Polite's Deposition only charged officer Rendulic with an assault.  Failure of Polite in his Deposition to name any of the other policemen defendants as participating in the assault requires entry of summary judgment in their favor under our holding is Howell v. Cataldi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"304768\"><a href=\"/opinion/304768/henry-howell-v-cataldi/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span> (1964), as spelled out at Note 23.  It is to be further noted on this score that Polite's Complaints contained only general allegations that he was 'subjected to physical abuse by the defendants' without designating any of them by name.  As stated in Note 23, we have time and again ruled that conclusory allegations of this nature require dismissal of a complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the 'coerced guilty plea,' the deposition of Kenneth J. Carroll, custodian of records of the McKeesport Police Department, taken by Polite and filed of record, disclosed that Polite entered a 'Plea of N.G.  (not guilty)' at the Sunday night hearing at which he was fined for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and failure to have a driver's license and ownership card as required by Pennsylvania law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Polite was arrested on August 17, 1969.

Plaintiff's causes of action are then formulated under 42 U.S.C. 1981 (1974) and 42 U.S.C. 1985 (1974).  The district court, apparently giving the complaints a broad reading, disposed of both of them under section 1983.  Polite v. Diehl, Civ. Nos. 71-637; 71-760 (W.D. Pa., July 7, 1972)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Depositions had been taken of Diehl, Polite, the driver and passenger in the other car involved in the accident and the custodian of the records of the McKeesport Police Department.  Polite had also filed an ophthalmologist's report.  The defendants later filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment on the ground that the record contained no support for plaintiff's allegations 'exclusive of false imprisonment, false arrest and assault and battery.'  (Appendix at 21a) The district court, in light of its disposition of the preceding motion for summary judgment, did not act on the supplemental motion for summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 12, 51: 'Every suit to recover damages for malicious prosecution or false arrest . . . must be brought within one year from the date of the accruing of such right of action, and not thereafter: . . .'</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 12, 34:</p>\n        <p>'Every suit hereafter brought to recover damages for injury wrongfully done to the person, in case where the injury does not result in death, must be brought within two years from the time when the injury was done and not afterwards; . . .'</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2318612\"><a href=\"/opinion/2318612/gagliardi-v-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></span> (1971)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Polite, supra, at 3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Polite, supra, at 3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> See fn. 6</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Smith v.

There, however, the court was dealing with a single act by the defendant which violated several of plaintiff's constitutional rights.  In the present case, however, the district court was dealing with separate acts where the alleged constitutional deprivations were not 'inextricably intertwined.'  Moreover, the statutory framework in Smith was different from that here.  The Smith court was faced with a choice between separate limitation statutes applicable to each analogous common law tort and a broad statute applicable to any 'liability created by statute.'  The court decided that the broad statute was applicable.

Not only may a man be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of a State, but an important element is necessary to convert the former into the latter.  He must reside within the State to make him a citizen of it, but it is only necessary that he should be born or naturalized in the United States to be a citizen of the Union.</p>\n        <p>'It is quite clear, then, that there is a citizenship of the United States, and a citizenship of a State, which are distinct from each other, and which depend upon different characteristics or circumstances in the individual.</p>\n        <p>. .  .  .te</p>\n        <p>'The language is, 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.'  It is a little remarkable, if this clause was intended as a protection to the citizen of a State against the legislative power of his own State, that the word citizen of the State should be left out when it is so carefully used, and used in contradistinction to citizens of the United States, in the very sentence which precedes it.  It is too clear for argument that the change in phraseology was adopted understandingly and with a purpose.</p>\n        <p>'Of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the United States, and of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the State, and what they respectively are, we will presently consider; but we wish to state here that it is only the former which are placed by this clause under the protection of the Federal Constitution, and that the latter, whatever they may be, are not intended to have any additional protection by this paragraph of the amendment.'  83 U.S. at 73-74.</p>\n        <p>The Court gave these examples of rights of national citizenship:</p>\n        <p>\"To come to the seat of government to assert any claim he may have upon that government, . . . to seek its protection, to share its offices, to engage in administering its functions . . ..'
