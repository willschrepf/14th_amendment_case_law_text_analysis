Borger\n\n\n\n                       OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n\nSTAPLETON, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n                                I.\n         Appellant, Susan Winters, brought this suit seeking recovery of money\nallegedly owed to her by the estate of her late and ex-husband, Ron Patel. She sought\nrecovery of these monies from not only Patel’s estate, but also his 401(k) plan, its\nadministrator, Philadelphia Newspaper Inc. (\"PNI\"), the law firm and individual attorney\nthat represented PNI in a privacy lawsuit brought by Winters, Patel’s wife at his death,\nand her own divorce attorney.\n         Winters was married to the late Ron Patel until early 1999. During their\nmarriage Patel was an editor for The Philadelphia Inquirer, a newspaper owed by appellee\nPNI, and was a participant in a 401(k) plan sponsored by Knight-Ridder, Inc., PNI’s\nparent (\"Plan\"). While the two were married, Winters was the beneficiary of Patel’s\n401(k) account.\n         In March 1997, Patel told Winters that he was having an affair with Mary\nFrangipanni and that he wanted a divorce. The Philadelphia Daily News, a newspaper\nPNI also owned, published an article about Patel’s relationship with Frangipanni.\nWinters then sued PNI for invasion of privacy in the Philadelphia Court of Common\nPleas. Appellee Dechert, a Philadelphia law firm (\"Dechert\"), represented PNI in that\nsuit, and appellee Jennifer Clarke, a partner at the Dechert firm, served as lead counsel.\nWinters was represented throughout the invasion of privacy litigation by the firm of\nSprague & Sprague.\n         Patel and Winters began divorce proceedings in March 1997. Winters was\nrepresented by Gary Borger in these proceedings. Borger requested information from\nPNI about obtaining a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (\"QDRO\"). Appellee Walter\nJ. Kutrip, the Director of Pension and Investment Retirement Savings Plans at Knight-\nRidder Inc. and the Plan Administrator, sent Borger Knight-Ridder’s policies and\nprocedures in connection with drafting a QDRO and offered his assistance in drafting\nsuch an order.\n         The divorce action concluded on January 7, 1999 with a settlement and the\nentry of a Judgment of Divorce and Stipulation of Settlement (\"the Consent Decree\").\nThe consent decree provides, in relevant part:\n         It is further agreed and ordered as follows:\n         1. Ronald Patel shall pay to Susan F. Winters the following\n         sums of money, which payments shall not be taxable to Susan\n         F. Winters:\n\n         A. $13,000.00 on or before 1/30/99;\n         B. 10,000.00 on or before 1/30/2000;\n         C. 20,000.00 on or before 1/30/2001;\n         D. $100,000 on or before 6/1/2007.\n\f         2. Ronald Patel shall provide security for the payment set\n         forth in paragraph number one hereinabove as follows:\n\n                              . . .\n\n         B. The payment of $10,000.00, due on or before 1/30/2000\n         shall be secured by the interest of Ronald Patel in the Knight-\n         Ridder Inc. Investment Savings 401(k) Plan, pursuant to Plan\n         rules and regulations.\n\n         C. The payment of $20,000.00, due on or before 1/30/2001,\n         shall be secured by Ronald Patel’s Knight-Ridder, Inc. stock\n         options exercisable in 2000. Ronald Patel shall give Susan F.\n         Winters prior notice of the exercise date and make payment\n         upon his receipt of the proceeds from the exercise of said\n         stock options.\n\n         D. The payment of $100,000.00, due on or before 6/1/2007,\n         shall be secured by Ronald Patel’s interest in the Knight-\n         Ridder Inc. Investment Savings 401(k) Plan, pursuant to Plan\n         rules and regulations.\n\n         E. Ronald Patel shall not borrow, withdraw, or reduce the\n         balance of his interest in the Knight-Ridder Inc. Investment\n         Savings 401(k) Plan below the amount set forth herein until\n         Ronald Patel’s obligation to Susan F. Winters under this\n         stipulation of settlement are paid in full.\n\n         (1)$100,000.00 minimum account balance (net of loan(s))\n         until 1/1/2001.\n\n         (2)$130,000.00 minimum account balance (net of loan(s))\n         after 1/1/2001 until Susan F. Winters is paid in full.\n\n         3. Ronald Patel shall provide and pay for a policy of\n         insurance on his life, naming Susan Winters the beneficiary in\n         an amount sufficient to satisfy the remaining balance due\n         pursuant to paragraph one of this Stipulation and Settlement.\n\n                              . . .\n\n         18. . . . Ronald Patel hereby waives any claim which he may\n         have to seek consolidation of the Pennsylvania litigation with\n         this matter or to assert the defense of the New Jersey Entire\n         Controversy Doctrine in this action.\n         Patel and Frangipanni married in March 1999. Patel then named\nFrangipanni as his beneficiary under the Plan. On January 7, 2000, Patel died. One\nmonth later, on February 7, 2000, the Plan honored Frangipanni’s request that Patel’s\n401(k) benefits be paid to her. On February 24, 2000, over thirteen months after the\nConsent Decree was entered, Borger wrote to Kutrip, as Plan Administrator, submitting a\ncopy of the Consent Decree and inquiring whether Patel’s 401(k) funds had been\ndisbursed. On March 30th, Kutrip responded advising \"that Mr. Patel’s interest in the\nInvestment Savings Plan does not, and did not ever, serve as security for any amount due\nMs. Winters from Mr. Patel.\" App. 363.\n         In May of 2000, the invasion of privacy action settled. The integrated\nSettlement Agreement contained mutual general releases which released \"all, and all\nmanner of, claims actions and causes of action, suits, . . . claims and demands whatsoever\nwhether arising in law or equity, in contract or tort, including but not limited to, all claim\nset forth or which could have been set forth arising from or with respect to ... Susan\n\fWinters v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., et al., [and several newspaper columns] ...,\nwhether known or unknown against Releasees from the beginning of the world to the date\nof these presents.\" App. 134.\n                               II.\n         Count I of Winters’ complaint purports to state a claim against the Plan for\nbenefits. It seeks a declaratory judgment that the Consent Decree is a QDRO and a\njudgment directing the Plan to pay Winters $130,000. Count II purports to state a claim\nagainst the Plan, Kutrip, PNI, Dechert and Clarke for breach of fiduciary duties imposed\nby ERISA. The breaches are alleged to be those defendants’ concealment from Winters,\nprior to her execution of the general release, of the facts that the Plan had bypassed the\nERISA mandate procedures relating to QDROs and had paid Patel’s 401(k) funds to\nFrangipanni. Count III purports to state a contract claim against Patel’s estate based on\nthe Consent Decree. Counts IV, V and VI are state law claims against Dechert, Clarke,\nPNI, Kutrip and Frangipanni for intentional interference with contract, \"Common law\nfraud\", and \"Fraud in the inducement.\" The remaining counts assert state law claims\nagainst Frangipanni individually and malpractice claims against Borger.\n         The District Court held that the Consent Decree was not a QDRO and\ndismissed Counts I and II on that ground as well as upon the ground that the purported\nclaims were covered by the general release. It also dismissed Counts IV through VI as\nbarred by the general release. Finally, the District Court refused to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the remaining claims against the Patel estate, Frangipanni, and Borger,\ndismissing them without prejudice.\n         Winters’ initial brief on appeal attacks the judgment of the District Court on\nthree grounds: (1) The District Court erred in giving effect to the general release because\nit was \"procured . . . through fraudulent misrepresentation and ERISA violations,\" (2) the\nDistrict Court erred in giving effect to the general release \"because Patel specifically\nwaived the right to consolidate the divorce and privacy matter\" and, accordingly, the\nscope of the release is limited to the claims at issue in the privacy matter, and (3) the\nDistrict Court erred in concluding that the Consent Decree was not a QDRO. Those are\nthe only issues properly before us. Federal Rule of Appellant Procedure 28. We will\naddress each in turn.\n                               III.\n         The District Court clearly did not err in holding that the state law claims\nasserted in Counts IV, V and VI were claims existing at the time of the execution of the\ngeneral release and were barred by the unambiguous terms of that release. Accepting as\ntrue Winters’ allegations that the Agreement settling the invasion of privacy litigation was\nfraudulently induced, she may have had the right at one time to tender the undisclosed\namount received by her in the settlement and rescind that agreement. But she has not\noffered, and is not now offering, to return what she received as a result of that settlement.\nAs the District Court held, under Pennsylvania law, she may not simultaneously affirm\nand reject the settlement. See, e.g., Allied Erecting & Dismantling Co. v. USX Corp.,\n249 F.3d 191, 200 (3d Cir. 2001) (explaining and applying the rule of Nocito v. Lanuitti,\n167 A.2d 262 (1961)).\n                               IV.\n         We simply do not find it material that Patel in the divorce settlement waived\nany right he may have had to consolidate the divorce and invasion of privacy proceedings.\n                                V.\n         Like the District Court, we conclude that the Consent Decree was not a\nQDRO and that the failure to advise Winters of Frangipanni’s withdrawal of Patel’s\n401(k) monies involved no breach of fiduciary duty.\n                                A.\n         ERISA has an anti-alienation provision which, with one narrow exception,\nprecludes the assignment of a participant’s interest in a covered plan. That narrow\nexception is a QDRO. See 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(A).\n          A QDRO is a domestic relations order that \"creates or recognizes the\nexistence of an alternate payee’s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to,\nreceive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under the plan.\n. . .\" 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(B)(i). While ERISA preemption provision is expansive,\nQDROs are not preempted by ERISA. Thus, if a plan is directed by a QDRO to transfer\n401(k) monies to an alternate payee, the plan violates ERISA if it does not pay the\n\falternate payee in accordance with the QDRO. On the other hand, in the absence of a\nQDRO, a plan violates ERISA if it transfers funds to anyone other than the participant or\nhis designated beneficiary.\n         A domestic relations order is a QDRO \"only if such order clearly specifies\":\n         (i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the\n         participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate\n         payee covered by the order,\n\n         (ii) the amount or percentage of the participant’s benefits to\n         be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the\n         manner in which such amount or percentage is to be\n         determined,\n\n         (iii) the number of payments or period to which such order\n         applies, and\n\n         (iv) each plan to which such order applies.\n\n29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(C).\n         Because a QDRO creates or recognizes a right to receive only benefits to\nwhich the participant is entitled under the terms of the plan, an order can be a QDRO\n\"only if such order . . . does not require the plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or\nany option, not otherwise provided under the plan. 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(D).\n         Receipt of a domestic relations order by a plan imposes on it a number of\nduties in addition to the obligation to honor the order if it turns out to be a QDRO.\nSection 1056(d)(3)(G)(i) of ERISA provides:\n         In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan\n\n         (I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant\n         and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the\n         plan’s procedures for determining the qualified status of\n         domestic relations orders, and\n\n         (II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the\n         plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a\n         qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant\n         and each alternate payee of such determination.\n         Moreover, \"during any period in which the issue of whether a domestic\nrelations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined,\" up to a\nmaximum of 18 months, the plan must segregate any amounts that become payable to the\nalternate payee under the order. 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(H).\n         Thus, \"[o]nce the pension plan is on notice that a domestic relations order\nhas issued that may be a QDRO,\" the plan must put the required process in motion and\nmaintain the status quo. Trustees of Directors Guild of America v. Tise, 234 F.3d 415,\n421 (9th Cir. 2000) (emphasis supplied). The converse is true by necessary implication:\nif a plan is not on notice that a domestic relations order has been entered that may be a\nQDRO, it is not relieved of its duty to meet its obligations to a participant and its\nbeneficiary as those obligations become due under the terms of the plan.\n                                B.\n         The Consent Decree purports to create a right to receive a payment from the\nPlan if Patel fails to pay $10,000 on or before January 30, 2000, and $100,000 on or\nbefore June 1, 2007. That \"security interest\" is not a benefit or a portion of a benefit due\nPatel under the terms of the Plan. This is persuasively demonstrated by the fact that the\nPlan could not have honored that interest consistent with its obligations under the Plan.\nPatel died on January 7, 2000. At that time neither of the purportedly secured obligations\nhad become due and it was impossible to tell whether the precondition of the Plan’s\nobligation to pay anything would be satisfied. Thus, honoring the Consent Decree would\nhave required the Plan to hold and administer his account for seven and one-half years\nafter his death, something it had not committed itself to do. Moreover, on Patel’s death\nthe designated beneficiary became entitled to the account balance under the terms of the\n\fPlan and the Plan was not at liberty to wait seven and one-half years to determine whether\nthere would be a default.\n         It necessarily follows that the Consent Decree did not clearly specify a\nbenefit which Patel had under the Plan. Under 1056(d)(3)(B), (C), and (D), this means\nthat the Consent Decree was not a QDRO. It also means that none of the defendants\nnamed in Count II had a fiduciary duty to advise Winters of Frangipanni’s withdrawal.\n                                C.\n         As we have noted, ERISA imposes certain duties on the Plan following its\nreceipt of a domestic relations order that may, but turns out not to be, a QDRO. Contrary\nto Winters’ suggestion, however, we conclude that those duties do not arise where, as\nhere, the benefit that is the purported subject of the order has been paid to another in\naccordance with the terms of the Plan prior to receipt of the domestic relations order.\n         Winters’ complaint contains detailed allegations regarding the\ncommunications engaged in on her behalf with the Plan administrator. Her attorney\nsought and received advice in 1997 about drafting a QDRO. His next contact with the\nadministrator was on February 24, 2000, when he provided Kutrip with a copy of the\nConsent Degree. This was over thirteen months after the Consent Order was entered, a\nmonth and one-half after Patel’s death, and two weeks after the Plan paid Frangipanni in\naccordance with the terms of the Plan.\n         Winters does not claim that she or anyone else acting on her behalf gave the\nPlan notice of the Consent Decree prior to February 24, 2000. She claims only that she\nprovided a copy of the Consent Decree to the defendants in the invasion of privacy suit in\nresponse to damage discovery prior to Frangipanni’s withdrawal and that appellees, PNI,\nDechert and Clarke, therefore, had knowledge of its existence and content prior to that\nwithdrawal. But none of these defendants had any responsibility for the administration of\nthe Plan and we know of no legal basis for imputing their knowledge to the Plan. They\nwere opposing Winters in her invasion of privacy lawsuit and received the document\nsolely for the purposes of defending that suit. They obviously owed her no duty to perfect\nany wholly unrelated claim she may have had against the Plan even if they had had some\nreason to believe she had not already submitted the Consent Decree to the Plan on her\nown behalf.\n         Winters nevertheless insists that the Plan had a duty on February 24, 2000,\nwhen it received the Consent Decree, to initiate a process of giving notice and\ndetermining whether the Consent Decree was a QDRO. This is important from her\nperspective because it is the sole basis for her contention that the Plan and Kutrip owed\nher a fiduciary duty on March 30, 2000, when Kutrip wrote rejecting the QDRO claim\nand not mentioning Frangipanni’s withdrawal. We are unpersuaded.\n         As we have previously pointed out, the statutory scheme is inconsistent with\nthe notion that Congress intended to impose a duty on an ERISA plan to honor a QDRO’s\nbenefit assignment when it has paid the benefit to the participant or his beneficiary in\naccordance with the plan before receiving notice of the QDRO. Indeed, Winters does not\ncontend otherwise. Yet the process which Winters claims should be obligatory following\nreceipt of a domestic relations order at any time is pointless where, as here, the plan will\nhave no duty to honor the benefit assignment in the event the order is ultimately deemed\nto be a QDRO. We are confident that Congress did not intend to require an ERISA plan\nwhich has done nothing more than honor its obligations under the terms of the plan to go\nthrough such a pointless process. And, in the absence of such a process, we perceive no\nbasis for finding that a plan owes a fiduciary duty to an alternate payee under a domestic\nrelations order of which it had no notice prior to disbursing the benefit at issue.\n         We hold that neither the Plan nor Kutrip had an ERISA created fiduciary\nobligation to Winters in the Spring of 2000. Since it is clear to us that PNI, Dechert and\nClarke also lacked such a fiduciary obligation, we agree with the District Court’s\ndismissal of Count II.\n                               VI.\n         The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.\n\n__________________________________\n\n\nTO THE CLERK:\n\fPlease file the foregoing Not Precedential Opinion.\n\n\n\n                      /s/Walter K.

Borger\n\n\n\n                       OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n\nSTAPLETON, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n                                I.\n         Appellant, Susan Winters, brought this suit seeking recovery of money\nallegedly owed to her by the estate of her late and ex-husband, Ron Patel. She sought\nrecovery of these monies from not only Patel’s estate, but also his 401(k) plan, its\nadministrator, Philadelphia Newspaper Inc. (\"PNI\"), the law firm and individual attorney\nthat represented PNI in a privacy lawsuit brought by Winters, Patel’s wife at his death,\nand her own divorce attorney.\n         Winters was married to the late Ron Patel until early 1999. During their\nmarriage Patel was an editor for The Philadelphia Inquirer, a newspaper owed by appellee\nPNI, and was a participant in a 401(k) plan sponsored by Knight-Ridder, Inc., PNI’s\nparent (\"Plan\"). While the two were married, Winters was the beneficiary of Patel’s\n401(k) account.\n         In March 1997, Patel told Winters that he was having an affair with Mary\nFrangipanni and that he wanted a divorce. The Philadelphia Daily News, a newspaper\nPNI also owned, published an article about Patel’s relationship with Frangipanni.\nWinters then sued PNI for invasion of privacy in the Philadelphia Court of Common\nPleas. Appellee Dechert, a Philadelphia law firm (\"Dechert\"), represented PNI in that\nsuit, and appellee Jennifer Clarke, a partner at the Dechert firm, served as lead counsel.\nWinters was represented throughout the invasion of privacy litigation by the firm of\nSprague & Sprague.\n         Patel and Winters began divorce proceedings in March 1997. Winters was\nrepresented by Gary Borger in these proceedings. Borger requested information from\nPNI about obtaining a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (\"QDRO\"). Appellee Walter\nJ. Kutrip, the Director of Pension and Investment Retirement Savings Plans at Knight-\nRidder Inc. and the Plan Administrator, sent Borger Knight-Ridder’s policies and\nprocedures in connection with drafting a QDRO and offered his assistance in drafting\nsuch an order.\n         The divorce action concluded on January 7, 1999 with a settlement and the\nentry of a Judgment of Divorce and Stipulation of Settlement (\"the Consent Decree\").\nThe consent decree provides, in relevant part:\n         It is further agreed and ordered as follows:\n         1. Ronald Patel shall pay to Susan F. Winters the following\n         sums of money, which payments shall not be taxable to Susan\n         F. Winters:\n\n         A. $13,000.00 on or before 1/30/99;\n         B. 10,000.00 on or before 1/30/2000;\n         C. 20,000.00 on or before 1/30/2001;\n         D. $100,000 on or before 6/1/2007.\n\f         2. Ronald Patel shall provide security for the payment set\n         forth in paragraph number one hereinabove as follows:\n\n                              . . .\n\n         B. The payment of $10,000.00, due on or before 1/30/2000\n         shall be secured by the interest of Ronald Patel in the Knight-\n         Ridder Inc. Investment Savings 401(k) Plan, pursuant to Plan\n         rules and regulations.\n\n         C. The payment of $20,000.00, due on or before 1/30/2001,\n         shall be secured by Ronald Patel’s Knight-Ridder, Inc. stock\n         options exercisable in 2000. Ronald Patel shall give Susan F.\n         Winters prior notice of the exercise date and make payment\n         upon his receipt of the proceeds from the exercise of said\n         stock options.\n\n         D. The payment of $100,000.00, due on or before 6/1/2007,\n         shall be secured by Ronald Patel’s interest in the Knight-\n         Ridder Inc. Investment Savings 401(k) Plan, pursuant to Plan\n         rules and regulations.\n\n         E. Ronald Patel shall not borrow, withdraw, or reduce the\n         balance of his interest in the Knight-Ridder Inc. Investment\n         Savings 401(k) Plan below the amount set forth herein until\n         Ronald Patel’s obligation to Susan F. Winters under this\n         stipulation of settlement are paid in full.\n\n         (1)$100,000.00 minimum account balance (net of loan(s))\n         until 1/1/2001.\n\n         (2)$130,000.00 minimum account balance (net of loan(s))\n         after 1/1/2001 until Susan F. Winters is paid in full.\n\n         3. Ronald Patel shall provide and pay for a policy of\n         insurance on his life, naming Susan Winters the beneficiary in\n         an amount sufficient to satisfy the remaining balance due\n         pursuant to paragraph one of this Stipulation and Settlement.\n\n                              . . .\n\n         18. . . . Ronald Patel hereby waives any claim which he may\n         have to seek consolidation of the Pennsylvania litigation with\n         this matter or to assert the defense of the New Jersey Entire\n         Controversy Doctrine in this action.\n         Patel and Frangipanni married in March 1999. Patel then named\nFrangipanni as his beneficiary under the Plan. On January 7, 2000, Patel died. One\nmonth later, on February 7, 2000, the Plan honored Frangipanni’s request that Patel’s\n401(k) benefits be paid to her. On February 24, 2000, over thirteen months after the\nConsent Decree was entered, Borger wrote to Kutrip, as Plan Administrator, submitting a\ncopy of the Consent Decree and inquiring whether Patel’s 401(k) funds had been\ndisbursed. On March 30th, Kutrip responded advising \"that Mr. Patel’s interest in the\nInvestment Savings Plan does not, and did not ever, serve as security for any amount due\nMs. Winters from Mr. Patel.\" App. 363.\n         In May of 2000, the invasion of privacy action settled. The integrated\nSettlement Agreement contained mutual general releases which released \"all, and all\nmanner of, claims actions and causes of action, suits, . . . claims and demands whatsoever\nwhether arising in law or equity, in contract or tort, including but not limited to, all claim\nset forth or which could have been set forth arising from or with respect to ... Susan\n\fWinters v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., et al., [and several newspaper columns] ...,\nwhether known or unknown against Releasees from the beginning of the world to the date\nof these presents.\" App. 134.\n                               II.\n         Count I of Winters’ complaint purports to state a claim against the Plan for\nbenefits. It seeks a declaratory judgment that the Consent Decree is a QDRO and a\njudgment directing the Plan to pay Winters $130,000. Count II purports to state a claim\nagainst the Plan, Kutrip, PNI, Dechert and Clarke for breach of fiduciary duties imposed\nby ERISA. The breaches are alleged to be those defendants’ concealment from Winters,\nprior to her execution of the general release, of the facts that the Plan had bypassed the\nERISA mandate procedures relating to QDROs and had paid Patel’s 401(k) funds to\nFrangipanni. Count III purports to state a contract claim against Patel’s estate based on\nthe Consent Decree. Counts IV, V and VI are state law claims against Dechert, Clarke,\nPNI, Kutrip and Frangipanni for intentional interference with contract, \"Common law\nfraud\", and \"Fraud in the inducement.\" The remaining counts assert state law claims\nagainst Frangipanni individually and malpractice claims against Borger.\n         The District Court held that the Consent Decree was not a QDRO and\ndismissed Counts I and II on that ground as well as upon the ground that the purported\nclaims were covered by the general release. It also dismissed Counts IV through VI as\nbarred by the general release. Finally, the District Court refused to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the remaining claims against the Patel estate, Frangipanni, and Borger,\ndismissing them without prejudice.\n         Winters’ initial brief on appeal attacks the judgment of the District Court on\nthree grounds: (1) The District Court erred in giving effect to the general release because\nit was \"procured . . . through fraudulent misrepresentation and ERISA violations,\" (2) the\nDistrict Court erred in giving effect to the general release \"because Patel specifically\nwaived the right to consolidate the divorce and privacy matter\" and, accordingly, the\nscope of the release is limited to the claims at issue in the privacy matter, and (3) the\nDistrict Court erred in concluding that the Consent Decree was not a QDRO. Those are\nthe only issues properly before us. Federal Rule of Appellant Procedure 28. We will\naddress each in turn.\n                               III.\n         The District Court clearly did not err in holding that the state law claims\nasserted in Counts IV, V and VI were claims existing at the time of the execution of the\ngeneral release and were barred by the unambiguous terms of that release. Accepting as\ntrue Winters’ allegations that the Agreement settling the invasion of privacy litigation was\nfraudulently induced, she may have had the right at one time to tender the undisclosed\namount received by her in the settlement and rescind that agreement. But she has not\noffered, and is not now offering, to return what she received as a result of that settlement.\nAs the District Court held, under Pennsylvania law, she may not simultaneously affirm\nand reject the settlement.

That narrow\nexception is a QDRO. See 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(A).\n          A QDRO is a domestic relations order that \"creates or recognizes the\nexistence of an alternate payee’s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to,\nreceive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under the plan.\n. . .\" 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(B)(i). While ERISA preemption provision is expansive,\nQDROs are not preempted by ERISA. Thus, if a plan is directed by a QDRO to transfer\n401(k) monies to an alternate payee, the plan violates ERISA if it does not pay the\n\falternate payee in accordance with the QDRO. On the other hand, in the absence of a\nQDRO, a plan violates ERISA if it transfers funds to anyone other than the participant or\nhis designated beneficiary.\n         A domestic relations order is a QDRO \"only if such order clearly specifies\":\n         (i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the\n         participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate\n         payee covered by the order,\n\n         (ii) the amount or percentage of the participant’s benefits to\n         be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the\n         manner in which such amount or percentage is to be\n         determined,\n\n         (iii) the number of payments or period to which such order\n         applies, and\n\n         (iv) each plan to which such order applies.\n\n29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(C).\n         Because a QDRO creates or recognizes a right to receive only benefits to\nwhich the participant is entitled under the terms of the plan, an order can be a QDRO\n\"only if such order . . . does not require the plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or\nany option, not otherwise provided under the plan. 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(D).\n         Receipt of a domestic relations order by a plan imposes on it a number of\nduties in addition to the obligation to honor the order if it turns out to be a QDRO.\nSection 1056(d)(3)(G)(i) of ERISA provides:\n         In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan\n\n         (I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant\n         and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the\n         plan’s procedures for determining the qualified status of\n         domestic relations orders, and\n\n         (II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the\n         plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a\n         qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant\n         and each alternate payee of such determination.\n         Moreover, \"during any period in which the issue of whether a domestic\nrelations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined,\" up to a\nmaximum of 18 months, the plan must segregate any amounts that become payable to the\nalternate payee under the order. 29 U.S.C. 1056(d)(3)(H).\n         Thus, \"[o]nce the pension plan is on notice that a domestic relations order\nhas issued that may be a QDRO,\" the plan must put the required process in motion and\nmaintain the status quo.

The converse is true by necessary implication:\nif a plan is not on notice that a domestic relations order has been entered that may be a\nQDRO, it is not relieved of its duty to meet its obligations to a participant and its\nbeneficiary as those obligations become due under the terms of the plan.\n                                B.\n         The Consent Decree purports to create a right to receive a payment from the\nPlan if Patel fails to pay $10,000 on or before January 30, 2000, and $100,000 on or\nbefore June 1, 2007. That \"security interest\" is not a benefit or a portion of a benefit due\nPatel under the terms of the Plan. This is persuasively demonstrated by the fact that the\nPlan could not have honored that interest consistent with its obligations under the Plan.\nPatel died on January 7, 2000. At that time neither of the purportedly secured obligations\nhad become due and it was impossible to tell whether the precondition of the Plan’s\nobligation to pay anything would be satisfied. Thus, honoring the Consent Decree would\nhave required the Plan to hold and administer his account for seven and one-half years\nafter his death, something it had not committed itself to do. Moreover, on Patel’s death\nthe designated beneficiary became entitled to the account balance under the terms of the\n\fPlan and the Plan was not at liberty to wait seven and one-half years to determine whether\nthere would be a default.\n         It necessarily follows that the Consent Decree did not clearly specify a\nbenefit which Patel had under the Plan. Under 1056(d)(3)(B), (C), and (D), this means\nthat the Consent Decree was not a QDRO. It also means that none of the defendants\nnamed in Count II had a fiduciary duty to advise Winters of Frangipanni’s withdrawal.\n                                C.\n         As we have noted, ERISA imposes certain duties on the Plan following its\nreceipt of a domestic relations order that may, but turns out not to be, a QDRO. Contrary\nto Winters’ suggestion, however, we conclude that those duties do not arise where, as\nhere, the benefit that is the purported subject of the order has been paid to another in\naccordance with the terms of the Plan prior to receipt of the domestic relations order.\n         Winters’ complaint contains detailed allegations regarding the\ncommunications engaged in on her behalf with the Plan administrator. Her attorney\nsought and received advice in 1997 about drafting a QDRO. His next contact with the\nadministrator was on February 24, 2000, when he provided Kutrip with a copy of the\nConsent Degree. This was over thirteen months after the Consent Order was entered, a\nmonth and one-half after Patel’s death, and two weeks after the Plan paid Frangipanni in\naccordance with the terms of the Plan.\n         Winters does not claim that she or anyone else acting on her behalf gave the\nPlan notice of the Consent Decree prior to February 24, 2000. She claims only that she\nprovided a copy of the Consent Decree to the defendants in the invasion of privacy suit in\nresponse to damage discovery prior to Frangipanni’s withdrawal and that appellees, PNI,\nDechert and Clarke, therefore, had knowledge of its existence and content prior to that\nwithdrawal. But none of these defendants had any responsibility for the administration of\nthe Plan and we know of no legal basis for imputing their knowledge to the Plan. They\nwere opposing Winters in her invasion of privacy lawsuit and received the document\nsolely for the purposes of defending that suit. They obviously owed her no duty to perfect\nany wholly unrelated claim she may have had against the Plan even if they had had some\nreason to believe she had not already submitted the Consent Decree to the Plan on her\nown behalf.\n         Winters nevertheless insists that the Plan had a duty on February 24, 2000,\nwhen it received the Consent Decree, to initiate a process of giving notice and\ndetermining whether the Consent Decree was a QDRO. This is important from her\nperspective because it is the sole basis for her contention that the Plan and Kutrip owed\nher a fiduciary duty on March 30, 2000, when Kutrip wrote rejecting the QDRO claim\nand not mentioning Frangipanni’s withdrawal. We are unpersuaded.\n         As we have previously pointed out, the statutory scheme is inconsistent with\nthe notion that Congress intended to impose a duty on an ERISA plan to honor a QDRO’s\nbenefit assignment when it has paid the benefit to the participant or his beneficiary in\naccordance with the plan before receiving notice of the QDRO. Indeed, Winters does not\ncontend otherwise. Yet the process which Winters claims should be obligatory following\nreceipt of a domestic relations order at any time is pointless where, as here, the plan will\nhave no duty to honor the benefit assignment in the event the order is ultimately deemed\nto be a QDRO. We are confident that Congress did not intend to require an ERISA plan\nwhich has done nothing more than honor its obligations under the terms of the plan to go\nthrough such a pointless process. And, in the absence of such a process, we perceive no\nbasis for finding that a plan owes a fiduciary duty to an alternate payee under a domestic\nrelations order of which it had no notice prior to disbursing the benefit at issue.\n         We hold that neither the Plan nor Kutrip had an ERISA created fiduciary\nobligation to Winters in the Spring of 2000. Since it is clear to us that PNI, Dechert and\nClarke also lacked such a fiduciary obligation, we agree with the District Court’s\ndismissal of Count II.\n                               VI.\n         The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.\n\n__________________________________\n\n\nTO THE CLERK:\n\fPlease file the foregoing Not Precedential Opinion.\n\n\n\n                      /s/Walter K.
