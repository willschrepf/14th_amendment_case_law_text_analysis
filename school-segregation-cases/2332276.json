R. Civ. P., motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law (case number 10-3104) and award of attorney’s fees (case number\n\n10-3328). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm in part,\n\nreverse in part, and remand for a determination of punitive damages.\n\n\n\n      *\n        This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th\nCir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                    Background\n\n      In 2003, Airbus Military selected Ratier, an affiliate of United\n\nTechnologies Corporation, to supply propellers for a proposed military transport\n\naircraft. Aplt. App. 593-94, 637-38. Hamilton, a subsidiary of United\n\nTechnologies, worked with Ratier to develop the propellers. Id. at 593-94, 656-\n\n67. Ratier and Hamilton (“Defendants”) in turn chose Plaintiff-Appellee ICE\n\nCorporation (“ICE”) as an independent contractor to supply a deicing controller\n\nfor the propellers.\n\n      During negotiations, Ratier sent ICE a form Master Terms Agreement\n\n(“MTA”) and form Purchase Agreement (“PA”). Id. at 761, 791, 804. ICE\n\nresponded with a Supplier Quotation, which expressly stated, “CONFIDENTIAL:\n\nInformation contained in this document is Competition Sensitive and is privileged\n\nand/or proprietary.” Id. at 676. The parties never executed the MTA or the PA\n\nbecause they disagreed on a pricing issue.\n\n      In November 2004, Ratier and ICE entered into a Memorandum of\n\nUnderstanding (“MOU”) whereby ICE would design and develop the deicing\n\ncontroller for the propellers, and Ratier would pay ICE for reaching certain\n\nmilestones. Id. at 706-09. The parties began performance under the contract.\n\nDue to changes in design specification, however, the parties later engaged in new\n\nprice negotiations, and were unable to agree to new terms. Id. at 609-18. Ratier\n\nreopened bidding and selected Artus, a French company, to replace ICE in\n\n                                        -2-\n\fSeptember 2005. Id. at 645-46.\n\n      In October 2005, ICE sent Ratier a letter demanding payment for an\n\noutstanding invoice of $153,708. Id. at 720-21, 757; Aplt. Br. 21. Ratier refused,\n\nand ICE sued, alleging claims for breach of express and implied contract,\n\nnegligent misrepresentation, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets\n\nunder the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“KUTSA”), unjust enrichment,\n\nfraud, and fraudulent concealment. Aplt. App. 162. Relevant to this appeal, ICE\n\nalleged that the Defendants misappropriated the following trade secrets by\n\npassing them on to Artus: (1) the communication method between the stationary\n\nand rotating elements of the controller, (2) a table of fault codes used to\n\ncommunicate deicing problems to the plane’s computer, and (3) a built-in test\n\n(“BIT”) system for detecting problems with the deicing system. Id. at 513-15,\n\n1099-111.\n\n      Defendants moved for summary judgment on, among other things, the\n\nmisappropriation of trade secrets claims, arguing that Ratier owned the trade\n\nsecrets, and thus, the Defendants could not have misappropriated them.\n\nSpecifically, they argued that the MOU was silent on the issue of ownership but\n\nthat Ratier owned the trade secrets under the common-law “hired-to-invent”\n\ndoctrine. Id. at 1221-22; Aplee. Supp. App. 160. The district court denied\n\nDefendants’ motion on this issue, apparently of the view that the evidence was\n\ncontroverted, and stated that “the parties’ conduct, as well as their written\n\n                                         -3-\n\fagreements, is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that ICE owns the\n\nalleged trade secrets in this matter.” Aplt. App. 1513 (emphasis added). The case\n\nproceeded to trial on ICE’s breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud,\n\nand misappropriation of trade secrets claims against Ratier and unjust enrichment\n\nand misappropriation of trade secrets claims against Hamilton. ICE Corp. v.\n\nHamilton Sundstrand Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1258 (D. Kan. 2009).\n\n      At the close of evidence, Defendants made an oral Rule 50(a), Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP., motion for judgment as a matter of law. Defendants sought to incorporate by\n\nreference all arguments they submitted in their voluminous summary judgment\n\nbriefs but made specific arguments concerning only the breach of duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation claims. Aplt. App.\n\n1548. The court took the motion under advisement at the time and ultimately\n\ndenied the motion. Id. at 1540; ICE Corp. v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., No. 05-\n\n4135-JAR, 2009 WL 1116319 (D. Kan. Apr. 22, 2009).\n\n      The jury found that Ratier willfully, wantonly, or maliciously\n\nmisappropriated all three trade secrets and awarded ICE $4,795,300 in\n\ncompensatory damages. Aplt. App. 315C. The jury also made an advisory award\n\nof $10,000,000 in punitive damages against Ratier. Id. In addition, the jury\n\nfound that Hamilton willfully, wantonly, or maliciously misappropriated the BIT\n\nsystem and table of fault codes, but did not award compensatory damages because\n\nof an error in the verdict form. Id. at 314-15; ICE Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n                                        -4-\n\f1258-59. The jury rendered an advisory award of $2,500,000 in punitive damages\n\nagainst Hamilton. Aplt. App. 315. The court then held a separate bench trial on\n\nthe compensatory damages against Hamilton and a hearing on the punitive\n\ndamages against both Defendants. ICE Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d at 1257-58; ICE\n\nCorp. v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d 1266, 1267-68 (D. Kan.\n\n2009). The court awarded lost profits compensatory damages of $4,795,300 and\n\npunitive damages of $2,397,650 against Hamilton and punitive damages, under\n\nKUTSA, of $9,590,600 against Ratier.\n\n      After judgment was entered, Defendants filed a renewed motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., seeking,\n\namong other things, to renew their summary judgment argument that Ratier\n\nowned the trade secrets. Aplt. App. 350, 359-65. In addition, they filed a Rule\n\n52(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., motion asking the court to amend the judgment against\n\nRatier, arguing that punitive damages cannot exceed $5 million under Kan. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 60-3702. Id. at 453, 461, 493-96.\n\n      The district court denied Defendants’ post-trial motions on these issues. At\n\nthe outset, the court concluded that, given the number of claims and issues\n\npresented by both parties, Defendants’ reference to their summary judgment\n\nbriefs in their oral Rule 50(a) motion did not preserve all sufficiency-of-the-\n\nevidence arguments for their Rule 50(b) motion. Id. at 1549-51. Rather, the\n\ncourt held that Defendants had preserved the sufficiency-of-the-evidence\n\n                                        -5-\n\farguments concerning only the breach of contract, fraud, and negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claims—the arguments that Defendants expressly argued in\n\ntheir Rule 50(a) motion. Id. The court then rejected Defendants’ arguments that\n\nRatier owned the trade secrets. Id. at 1557-59. In addition, the court concluded\n\nthat it properly awarded punitive damages against Ratier under KUTSA, which\n\npermits punitive damages up to twice the amount of compensatory damages. Id. at\n\n1605-08; Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3322.\n\n      While the post-trial motions were pending, ICE filed a motion for\n\nattorney’s fees, and the court ultimately awarded $1,138,013.25 in fees. ICE\n\nCorp. v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., No 05-4135-JAR, 2010 WL 4683981, at *14\n\n(D. Kan. Nov. 12, 2010).\n\n      In case number 10-3104, Defendants appeal the denial of their post-trial\n\nmotions, arguing that (1) they owned the trade secrets under the “hired-to-invent”\n\ndoctrine or as a matter of contract and (2) the district court erred in awarding\n\npunitive damages in excess of the $5 million cap imposed by Kan. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 60-3702. In case number 10-3328, they contend that the district court\n\nimproperly awarded attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n                                     Discussion\n\nA.    Ownership of Trade Secrets\n\n      Defendants first argue that the district court erred in denying its Rule 50(b)\n\n                                        -6-\n\fmotion on ownership because Ratier owns the trade secrets either under the\n\ncommon-law hired-to-invent doctrine or as a matter of contract. Aplt. Br. 38-53.\n\nICE contends that ownership was a factual issue that was submitted to the jury\n\nand that Defendants have not preserved for appeal any sufficiency-of-the-\n\nevidence argument regarding ownership because they did not raise it in their Rule\n\n50(a) motion. Aplee. Br. 18-19. Defendants disagree, arguing that the district\n\ncourt denied summary judgment on ownership as a purely legal matter. Aplt.\n\nReply Br. 5-6.\n\n      After reviewing the record, we agree with ICE that ownership was a factual\n\nissue submitted to the jury and that Defendants did not preserve the issue for\n\nappeal. Before discussion, we explain in further detail how the ownership issue\n\nwas raised and addressed in the district court.\n\n      1.     Procedural History\n\n      Defendants moved for summary judgment on the issue of ownership,\n\narguing that Ratier owned all the trade secrets under the common-law hired-to-\n\ninvent doctrine. Aplt. App. 1221-22; Aplee. Supp. App. 160. Specifically,\n\nDefendants argued that the MOU was silent on the issue of ownership, and thus,\n\nthe court should look to common law to determine ownership. Under the\n\ncommon-law hired-to-invent doctrine, Defendants argued, “[i]f an employer pays\n\nyou to design, the employer owns the fruit of your labor.” Aplt. App. 1221\n\n(quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, they asserted that Ratier owned the\n\n                                        -7-\n\fresults of ICE’s work because Ratier hired ICE to design and develop the\n\npropeller deicing controller. Id. at 1222.\n\n      In response, ICE argued that the intent of the contracting parties is a\n\nquestion of fact for the jury and that “[all] of the evidence in this case proves that\n\nthe parties intended, understood and agreed that ICE owned its proprietary and\n\ntrade secret design work.” Id. at 1087-88, 1090. ICE argued that the MOU\n\nincorporated by reference ICE’s Supplier Quotation—which expressly states that\n\nICE’s design information was confidential and proprietary to ICE—and noted that\n\nevery witness addressing ownership during discovery understood that ICE owned\n\nthe trade secrets. Id. at 1088-89. In addition, ICE argued that the hired-to-invent\n\nauthority cited by Ratier did not apply. Id. at 1090-92.\n\n      Defendants responded, again arguing that the MOU was silent on\n\nownership and that the hired-to-invent doctrine should control. Id. at 1402-03. In\n\naddition, Defendants argued that the evidence presented at summary judgment\n\nconfirmed the parties’ understanding that Ratier owned any trade secrets\n\ndeveloped in connection with the deicing controller. Id.\n\n      In its decision denying summary judgment, the court engaged in two\n\nseparate analyses regarding the issue of ownership: (1) ownership under the hired-\n\nto-invent doctrine and (2) ownership based on the parties’ conduct and written\n\nagreements. Id. at 1508-13. The court distinguished the authority cited by\n\nDefendants concerning the hired-to-invent doctrine and concluded that the\n\n                                          -8-\n\fdoctrine does not apply to independent contractors hired to specifically design a\n\nproduct, such as ICE. Id. at 1508-12.\n\n      After addressing the hired-to-invent doctrine, the court then addressed\n\nownership based on the parties’ conduct and written agreements. Initially, the\n\ncourt stated that “[u]nder the facts and circumstances of this case, it is clear that\n\nICE owns the alleged trade secrets.” Id. at 1512 (footnote omitted). In reaching\n\nthis conclusion, the court relied on EDO Corp. v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 715 F.\n\nSupp. 990, 995 (D. Kan. 1988) for the proposition that a contract between parties\n\ncan dictate which party owns technology developed pursuant to the contract. The\n\ncourt then explained that the MOU incorporated by reference the Supplier\n\nQuotation and that the language of the Supplier Quotation—as well as the\n\nlanguage of another agreement entered into by ICE and Hamilton—supported the\n\ncontention that ICE owned the trade secrets. Aplt. App. 1512-13. In conclusion,\n\nthe court stated that “the parties’ conduct, as well as their written agreements, is\n\nsufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that ICE owns the alleged trade\n\nsecrets in this matter.” Id. at 1513 (emphasis added). We read this conclusion to\n\nmean that the district court determined there were genuine disputes as to material\n\nfact regarding ownership, despite its original presupposition.\n\n      What’s more, Defendants agreed to the following jury instruction\n\nexplaining the elements of ICE’s misappropriation claim:\n\n      ICE asserts a claim against both Hamilton and Ratier for violation of\n\n                                          -9-\n\f        the Kansas Trade Secrets Act. In order to prevail on this claim, ICE\n        must prove each of the following essential elements: . . .\n\n        2. ICE is the owner of the information.\n\nAplt. App. 298. Thus, ownership was treated as a factual issue submitted to the\n\njury.\n\n        ICE’s conduct at trial bolsters this conclusion. ICE presented the Supplier\n\nQuotation and other documents exchanged between the parties indicating that all\n\ninformation contained within the documents was confidential and proprietary.\n\nSee, e.g., Aplt. App. 675-709; Aplee. Supp. App. 739, 767, 802, 1450, 1467,\n\n1608, 1802-04. Witnesses for ICE testified that Defendants never expressed any\n\nconcern or disagreement with the legends on the documents. See, e.g., Aplee.\n\nSupp. App. 1450-51, 1467, 1601-02. In addition, ICE presented emails from\n\nHamilton representatives stating that “[w]e have a lot of detailed design\n\ninformation from ICE on what they were doing and it is not right for this\n\ninformation to be shared with their potential competitors,” id. at 976, 1552, 1557,\n\nand “I am very concerned about how much and what kind of technical information\n\nhas been transferred to these guys by [Ratier] . . . I just want to be sure that we\n\nare not violating any proprietary agreement with ICE,” id. at 1005, 1558.\n\n        On appeal, Defendants argue that in denying summary judgment the district\n\ncourt incorrectly decided as a matter of law that ICE owned the trade secrets.\n\nAplt. Br. 44-45; Aplt. Reply Br. 9. However, the court expressly stated that the\n\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\fparties’ conduct and their written agreements were sufficient for a reasonable jury\n\nto conclude that ICE owns the trade secrets. Aplt. App. 1513. Thus, the district\n\ncourt did not decide that ICE, as a matter of law, owned the trade secrets. Rather,\n\nthe district court denied Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the issue\n\nand submitted it to the jury because a reasonable jury could conclude that ICE\n\nowned the trade secrets under the agreements between the parties.\n\n      2.     Analysis\n\n      “‘The denial of summary judgment based on factual disputes is not properly\n\nreviewable on an appeal from a final judgment entered after trial.’” Copar\n\nPumice Co., Inc. v. Morris, 639 F.3d 1025, 1031 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n\nHaberman v. The Hartford Ins. Group, 443 F.3d 1257, 1264 (10th Cir. 2006)).\n\nRather, the way to contest evidentiary sufficiency at trial is through subsequent\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rules 50(a) and (b) and\n\nappellate review of the motions if denied. See Ortiz v. Jordan, 131 S. Ct. 884,\n\n893 (2011); Kelley v. City of Albuquerque, 542 F.3d 802, 820 (10th Cir. 2008)\n\n(citation omitted). And ordinarily, a party cannot raise an argument in a Rule\n\n50(b) motion that it did not raise in its Rule 50(a) motion. See Therrien v. Target\n\nCorp., 617 F.3d 1242, 1250 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). We\n\nrecognize Defendants’ argument that a legal issue decided on summary judgment\n\nneed not be raised through Rule 50 motions, see Aplt. Reply Br. 6 (citing Ruyle v.\n\nCont’l Oil Co., 44 F.3d 837, 841 (10th Cir. 1994)), but we simply cannot agree\n\n                                        - 11 -\n\fthat the district court decided the ownership issue as a matter of law.\n\n      Thus, for us to review a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument regarding\n\nownership, Defendants were required to make the argument in their Rule 50(a)\n\nand 50(b) motions. Defendants have done neither. The district court held that\n\nDefendants failed to make such an argument in their Rule 50(a) motion, and\n\nDefendants have not challenged that point here. In addition, Defendants never\n\nmade a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument regarding ownership in their Rule\n\n50(b) motion. See Aplt. App. 361-65. Nor do they make that argument here.\n\nRather, they argued in their Rule 50(b) motion and before us that, as purely legal\n\nmatters, Ratier owned the trade secrets under the hired-to-invent doctrine or as a\n\nmatter of contract. Because Defendants failed to raise a sufficiency-of-the-\n\nevidence argument on ownership in their Rule 50(a) and 50(b) motions, we cannot\n\nreview the jury’s decision on ownership. Defendants’ failure to object to the jury\n\ninstruction on ownership further supports this conclusion of waiver. See Miller v.\n\nEby Realty Group LLC, 396 F.3d 1105, 1115 (10th Cir. 2005) (citing Atchley v.\n\nNordam Group, Inc., 180 F.3d 1143, 1147-48 (10th Cir. 1999)).\n\n      Defendants contend that the jury decided a different ownership issue than\n\nthe one they present here, namely, whether the parties jointly developed the table\n\nof fault codes. Aplt. Reply Br. 6 n.1. In seeking summary judgment, Defendants\n\nargued—separately from their general ownership argument—that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that they misappropriated the table of fault\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fcodes because ICE did not own the fault codes. Aplt. App. 1240. The district\n\ncourt disagreed, concluding that there was a genuine issue of material fact\n\nregarding this issue. Id. at 1521. Although this issue was submitted to the jury,\n\nthere is no indication that it was the only ownership issue submitted for the jury\n\nto decide. See id. at 298. In addition, Defendants’ argument ignores the district\n\ncourt’s express statement that a reasonable jury could conclude the ICE owned all\n\nthe trade secrets pursuant to their conduct and agreements. Id. at 1513.\n\n      Defendants also contend that the court’s conclusion at summary judgment\n\nthat the hired-to-invent doctrine did not apply to ICE because ICE was an\n\nindependent contractor was decided as a matter of law and can be reviewed on\n\nappeal. Aplt. Reply Br. 8-9. Regardless of the court’s ruling on the hired-to-\n\ninvent doctrine, the court concluded that a reasonable jury could determine\n\nownership based on the parties’ conduct and written agreements. Thus, there is\n\nno need to look to the common-law hired-to-invent doctrine. 1 Indeed, Defendants\n\nhave repeatedly argued that the hired-to-invent doctrine does not apply if the\n\nagreement between the parties dictates otherwise. See, e.g., Aplt. Br. 44; Aplt.\n\nReply Br. 8; Aplt. App. 360, 1221-22. See also 27 Am. Jur. 2d Employment\n\nRelationship § 182 (2011) (hired-to-invent doctrine applies only absent an\n\nagreement to the contrary). The jury necessarily found that the ICE owned the\n\n      1\n         Because the issue submitted to the jury was whether ICE owned the trade\nsecrets based on the agreements and conduct between the parties, we need not\nopine on the district court’s analysis of the hired-to-invent doctrine.\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\ftrade secrets by agreement.\n\n       Accordingly, ownership of the trade secrets was submitted to the jury, and\n\nDefendants have not preserved a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument regarding\n\nthis issue.\n\nB.     Punitive Damages\n\n       Defendants contend that the district court erred in awarding punitive\n\ndamages of nearly $10 million against Ratier under KUTSA, arguing that the\n\ncourt’s award exceeds the $5 million cap imposed by Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3702.\n\nAplt. Br. 53-59. We review the district court’s interpretation of state law de\n\nnovo. Cooper v. Cent. & Sw. Servs., 271 F.3d 1247, 1251 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\n       Section 60-3702 of Kansas’s general punitive damages statute governs “any\n\ncivil action in which exemplary or punitive damages are recoverable” and\n\nprovides that no award shall exceed the lesser of (1) the annual gross income\n\nearned by the defendant or (2) $5 million. Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3702(a), (e). The\n\nlesser amount here is $5 million. Section 60-3702(f) allows a court to exceed the\n\ncap upon a finding that profitability of a defendant’s misconduct exceeds or is\n\nexpected to exceed the cap, and award up to one-and-a-half times the amount of\n\nsuch profit. Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3702(f).\n\n       The punitive damages provision of KUTSA provides that “[i]f willful and\n\nmalicious misappropriation exists, the court may award exemplary damages in an\n\namount not exceeding twice any award [of compensatory damages].” Kan. Stat.\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fAnn. § 60-3322(b). Finding that the two statutes conflict and that KUTSA was\n\nthe more specific of the two, the district court applied KUTSA and awarded\n\n$9,590,600 in punitive damages against Ratier. ICE Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n1270-71, 1277. We cannot agree with this analysis.\n\n      At the outset, we reject ICE’s argument that § 60-3702 does not apply\n\nbecause it applies only to punitive damages awarded “pursuant to this section”\n\napparently referencing § 60-3702(e). Aplee. Br. 54. As stated above, § 60-\n\n3702(a) references “any civil action.” Notably, the district court relied upon the\n\nfactors set forth in § 60-3702(b) (which contains identical “pursuant to this\n\nsection” language) in awarding punitive damages. ICE Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n1271. Indeed, ICE argued in the district court that reliance upon these factors\n\nsupported the punitive damages award. Aplt. Supp. App. 1741.\n\n      Under Kansas law, “[g]eneral and special statutes should be read together\n\nand harmonized whenever possible, but to the extent a conflict between them\n\nexists, the special statute will prevail unless it appears the legislature intended to\n\nmake the general statute controlling.” State v. Le, 926 P.2d 638, 640 (Kan. 1996)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 60-3702(e)\n\nand 3322(b) can be read together and harmonized such that in a trade secret\n\nmisappropriation action, punitive damages are limited to twice the amount of\n\ncompensatory damages up to $5 million. See Meitler Consulting, Inc. v. Dooley,\n\nNo. 05-2126-DJW, 2007 WL 1834008, at *14 (D. Kan. 2007) (“Any award of\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\fexemplary damages under the Kansas Trade Secrets Act is governed by the\n\nlimitations imposed by K.S.A. 60-3702 . . . .”). Thus, although we recognize\n\nICE’s argument that KUTSA “displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary and other\n\nlaw of this state providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret,”\n\nsee Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3326(a), we do not see a conflict here.\n\n      Even if we perceived a conflict, the more general statutory cap applies here\n\nbecause it appears the Kansas legislature intended the more general cap to\n\ncontrol. Under Kansas law, “older statutes . . . are subordinate to new enactments\n\n. . . as the newer statute is the later expression of the legislative intent and so will\n\ncontrol if there is a possible conflict between the two.” Jones v. Cont’l Can Co.,\n\n920 P.2d 939, 945 (Kan. 1996) (citation omitted). The Kansas legislature passed\n\n§ 60-3702 in 1988, seven years after enacting KUTSA. Compare Kan. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 60-3702 with Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3322. Accordingly, § 60-3702 governs. 2\n\n      ICE argues that if § 60-3702 governs, then § 60-3702(f) justifies the\n\npunitive damages award over $5 million because Ratier is expected to realize\n\n\n      2\n         Following disposition of this issue in the district court, another Kansas\nfederal district court concluded that § 60-3702(a)’s bifurcated system of allowing\nthe jury to determine whether punitive damages can be recovered and then\nallowing the court to determine the amount of damages violates the Seventh\nAmendment because the Seventh Amendment requires that the jury be allowed to\ndetermine the amount of punitive damages. See Capital Solutions, LLC v. Konica\nMinolta Bus. Solutions, USA, Inc., 695 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1152, 1155-56 (D. Kan.\n2010). The district court in this case held otherwise. See ICE Corp., 615 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1269-70. The parties do not make any arguments on this issue on\nappeal, and we have no need to address it.\n\n                                          - 16 -\n\fprofits of between $85 and $139.5 million on the entire project. Aplee. Br. at 57-\n\n59; see also Aplt. Supp. App. 1746-47 (making same argument before district\n\ncourt). In order to award over $5 million dollars under § 60-3702 in this case,\n\nhowever, the court needed to make a finding that “the profitability of the\n\ndefendant’s misconduct exceeds or is expected to exceed” the $5 million cap. See\n\nKan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3702(f). The district court made no such finding because it\n\napplied the punitive damages provision in KUTSA. We therefore remand for the\n\ndistrict court to apply § 60-3702 and to consider whether the $5 million cap under\n\n§ 60-3072(e) or the larger cap under § 60-3702(f) applies. We note that to apply\n\nsubsection (f), the court must find that the profitability of Ratier’s\n\nmisconduct—not profitability from the entire project—exceeds or is expected to\n\nexceed $5 million.\n\nC.    Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In case number 10-3328, Defendants appeal the district court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees under KUTSA. 3\n\n      In its initial request for attorney’s fees, ICE requested $1,625,620.75 for\n\n8,843.65 hours of billable time. Aplt. App. 420. The district court granted in part\n\nand denied in part ICE’s motion, concluding that ICE could receive fees incurred\n\nprosecuting the misappropriation claims, but ordering ICE to segregate the time\n\n\n      3\n        The citations to the parties’ briefs and Appendices in this section refer to\nthose submitted for case 10-3328.\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\fspent on the misappropriation claims from the time spent on other, non-\n\ncompensable claims, and to then resubmit its request. Id. at 427-28.\n\n      ICE segregated its fee statements, eliminating any easily identifiable non-\n\ncompensable time entries and applying an across the board 30% reduction in\n\nhours to entries containing compensable and non-compensable claims where it\n\ncould not otherwise allocate time. Id. at 433-34. ICE also removed all time for\n\nthe first week of trial and eliminated six entries that it determined were\n\nduplications. Id. at 690. ICE subsequently requested $1,257,704.00 for 6,512.75\n\nhours of billable time. Id. at 434-35. The district court reduced the requested\n\namount by 880.85 hours—the time claimed by timekeepers for which ICE could\n\nnot establish a reasonable hourly rate—and awarded $1,134,438.25 in attorney’s\n\nfees. ICE Corp., 2010 WL 4683981, at *6, *14.\n\n      On appeal, Defendants argue that the district court erred because (1) the\n\ncourt did not consider the punitive damages award in determining whether, as a\n\nthreshold matter, ICE could receive attorney’s fees under KUTSA, and (2) ICE\n\nfailed to submit meticulous, contemporaneous billing records. We review the\n\nlegal principles underlying an award of attorney’s fees de novo, but the actual\n\naward of fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Combs v. Shelter Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., 551 F.3d 991, 1001 (10th Cir. 2008). In diversity cases, attorney’s fees are\n\ncontrolled by state law. Id. (citation omitted).\n\n       Under Kansas law, a court may award attorney fees if they are specifically\n\n                                         - 18 -\n\fallowed by statute. Hodges v. Johnson, 199 P.3d 1251, 1262 (Kan. 2009)\n\n(citation omitted). A provision of KUTSA, which is identical to Section 4 of the\n\nUniform Trade Secrets Act (“UTSA”) provides that if “willful and malicious\n\nmisappropriation exists, the court may award reasonable attorney’s fees to the\n\nprevailing party.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3323; see Unif. Trade Secrets Act § 4\n\n(2005). The jury found that the misappropriation was willful and malicious; thus,\n\nthe court had the discretion to award reasonable attorney’s fees. See Aplt. App.\n\n329-33.\n\n      Relying on a comment to Section 4 of UTSA which states that a court\n\n“should take into consideration the extent to which a complainant will recover\n\nexemplary damages in determining whether additional attorney’s fees should be\n\nawarded,” Defendants argue that the district court erred by not considering the\n\npunitive damages award when determining whether it could award attorney’s fees.\n\nSee Aplt. Br. 24-25; Unif. Trade Secrets Act § 4, cmt. They insist that a court\n\nmust make an express consideration and cite to Progressive Prods., Inc. v. Swartz,\n\n205 P.3d 766, 777-78 (Kan. App. 2009), where the Court of Appeals of Kansas\n\nlooked to the comments of UTSA to interpret a different provision of KUTSA.\n\nAplt. Br. 24-25. Even if a court should consider punitive damages in determining\n\nattorney’s fees, the district court did.\n\n      In its initial order addressing attorney’s fees, the district court concluded\n\nthat it could make such an award because the jury found that the misappropriation\n\n                                           - 19 -\n\fin this case was willful and malicious. Aplt. App. 419. The court also stated that\n\nit would consider the punitive damages award in its determination of\n\nreasonableness of fees, but not in its initial determination of whether it could\n\naward the fees under KUTSA. See id. at 420 n.10.\n\n      In a later order addressing the reasonableness of fees, however, the court\n\nparaphrased the Defendants’ argument and rejected it:\n\n      B. Defendants’ Request that the Court Deny Any Award of\n      Attorneys’ Fees\n\n             As an initial matter, the Court considers defendants’ argument\n      that the Court should altogether deny plaintiff reasonable attorneys’\n      fees because plaintiff already received a significant recovery in\n      compensatory and punitive damages. Since plaintiff’s counsel is\n      compensated in this case through a contingency fee arrangement,\n      defendants urge that the significant punitive damages award ensures\n      that plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees would not diminish its compensatory\n      damages award. To the extent defendants ask this Court to reconsider\n      its determination on plaintiff’s entitlement to reasonable attorneys’ fees\n      in this matter, the Court declines.\n\nICE Corp., 2010 WL 4683981, at *2. We read the district court’s order as having\n\nexpressly rejected the Defendants’ argument.\n\n      Defendants argue that the district court awarded attorney’s fees based\n\nsolely upon the finding that the misappropriation was willful and malicious, but\n\nsuch a reading is contrary to the district court’s statement that it considered the\n\nargument and declined to change its mind. To be sure, more analysis would have\n\nbeen helpful, but we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion—the\n\ncomment is general and the district court apparently thought that the conduct at\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fissue justified an award of attorney’s fees notwithstanding the general enrichment\n\nof ICE.\n\n      Defendants also challenge the court’s reasonable fee determination. “In\n\nKansas, ‘[t]he reasonable value of attorney fees lies within the sound discretion of\n\nthe district court.’” Beck v. N. Natural Gas Co., 170 F.3d 1018, 1025 (10th Cir.\n\n1999) (quoting Hawkins v. Dennis, 905 P.2d 678, 692 (Kan.1995)). In\n\ndetermining a reasonable fee, Kansas courts multiply a reasonable number of\n\nhours worked by a reasonable hourly rate. Sheldon v. Vermonty, 237 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1270, 1274 (D. Kan. 2002) (citation omitted). The applicant bears the burden of\n\nsupporting its fee request with “‘meticulous, contemporaneous time records’ that\n\nshow the specific tasks being billed.” Davis v. Miller, 7 P.3d 1223, 1235 (Kan.\n\n2000) (quoting Case v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 233, 157 F.3d 1243, 1250 (10th\n\nCir. 1998)). The court should consider the eight factors set forth in Rule 1.5 of\n\nthe Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct in determining the reasonableness of a\n\nfee. Id. at 751.\n\n      Defendants argue that ICE’s use of block billing—the practice of “lumping\n\nmultiple tasks into a single entry of time”—prevented it from submitting\n\nmeticulous, contemporaneous records of its attorney’s time. See Aplt. Br. 35;\n\nHamilton v. Boise Cascade Exp., 519 F.3d 1197, 1207 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n      There is no per se rule in this circuit mandating a reduction or denial of a\n\n                                         - 21 -\n\ffee request based on block billing. Cadena v. Pacesetter Corp., 224 F.3d 1203,\n\n1215 (10th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). The district court concluded that the\n\nblock billing did not prevent it from determining the reasonableness of the fee\n\nrequest, finding instead that it could “easily” review the entries for\n\nreasonableness. ICE Corp., 2010 WL 4683981, at *6. Based on its intimate\n\nfamiliarity with the case, the case’s complexity, the number of reasonable\n\nstrategies pursued, the responses necessitated by the maneuvering of the other\n\nside, and any potential duplication of services, the court concluded that ICE\n\nmaintained meticulous and contemporaneous time records and that the revised fee\n\nrequest was reasonable. Id. at *7-8, *11; Case, 157 F.3d at 1250 (listing\n\nreasonableness factors). In addition, the court considered the factors set forth in\n\nRule 1.5 of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct. See ICE Corp., 2010 WL\n\n4683981, at *11. We are unable to say that the court abused its discretion.\n\n      AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part and REMANDED for a\n\ndetermination of a punitive damages award under Kan. Stat.

R. Civ. P., motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law (case number 10-3104) and award of attorney’s fees (case number\n\n10-3328). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm in part,\n\nreverse in part, and remand for a determination of punitive damages.\n\n\n\n      *\n        This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th\nCir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                    Background\n\n      In 2003, Airbus Military selected Ratier, an affiliate of United\n\nTechnologies Corporation, to supply propellers for a proposed military transport\n\naircraft. Aplt. App. 593-94, 637-38. Hamilton, a subsidiary of United\n\nTechnologies, worked with Ratier to develop the propellers. Id. at 593-94, 656-\n\n67. Ratier and Hamilton (“Defendants”) in turn chose Plaintiff-Appellee ICE\n\nCorporation (“ICE”) as an independent contractor to supply a deicing controller\n\nfor the propellers.\n\n      During negotiations, Ratier sent ICE a form Master Terms Agreement\n\n(“MTA”) and form Purchase Agreement (“PA”). Id. at 761, 791, 804. ICE\n\nresponded with a Supplier Quotation, which expressly stated, “CONFIDENTIAL:\n\nInformation contained in this document is Competition Sensitive and is privileged\n\nand/or proprietary.” Id. at 676. The parties never executed the MTA or the PA\n\nbecause they disagreed on a pricing issue.\n\n      In November 2004, Ratier and ICE entered into a Memorandum of\n\nUnderstanding (“MOU”) whereby ICE would design and develop the deicing\n\ncontroller for the propellers, and Ratier would pay ICE for reaching certain\n\nmilestones. Id. at 706-09. The parties began performance under the contract.\n\nDue to changes in design specification, however, the parties later engaged in new\n\nprice negotiations, and were unable to agree to new terms. Id. at 609-18. Ratier\n\nreopened bidding and selected Artus, a French company, to replace ICE in\n\n                                        -2-\n\fSeptember 2005. Id. at 645-46.\n\n      In October 2005, ICE sent Ratier a letter demanding payment for an\n\noutstanding invoice of $153,708. Id. at 720-21, 757; Aplt. Br. 21. Ratier refused,\n\nand ICE sued, alleging claims for breach of express and implied contract,\n\nnegligent misrepresentation, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets\n\nunder the Kansas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“KUTSA”), unjust enrichment,\n\nfraud, and fraudulent concealment. Aplt. App. 162. Relevant to this appeal, ICE\n\nalleged that the Defendants misappropriated the following trade secrets by\n\npassing them on to Artus: (1) the communication method between the stationary\n\nand rotating elements of the controller, (2) a table of fault codes used to\n\ncommunicate deicing problems to the plane’s computer, and (3) a built-in test\n\n(“BIT”) system for detecting problems with the deicing system. Id. at 513-15,\n\n1099-111.\n\n      Defendants moved for summary judgment on, among other things, the\n\nmisappropriation of trade secrets claims, arguing that Ratier owned the trade\n\nsecrets, and thus, the Defendants could not have misappropriated them.\n\nSpecifically, they argued that the MOU was silent on the issue of ownership but\n\nthat Ratier owned the trade secrets under the common-law “hired-to-invent”\n\ndoctrine. Id. at 1221-22; Aplee. Supp. App. 160. The district court denied\n\nDefendants’ motion on this issue, apparently of the view that the evidence was\n\ncontroverted, and stated that “the parties’ conduct, as well as their written\n\n                                         -3-\n\fagreements, is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that ICE owns the\n\nalleged trade secrets in this matter.” Aplt. App. 1513 (emphasis added). The case\n\nproceeded to trial on ICE’s breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud,\n\nand misappropriation of trade secrets claims against Ratier and unjust enrichment\n\nand misappropriation of trade secrets claims against Hamilton.

The court awarded lost profits compensatory damages of $4,795,300 and\n\npunitive damages of $2,397,650 against Hamilton and punitive damages, under\n\nKUTSA, of $9,590,600 against Ratier.\n\n      After judgment was entered, Defendants filed a renewed motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., seeking,\n\namong other things, to renew their summary judgment argument that Ratier\n\nowned the trade secrets. Aplt. App. 350, 359-65. In addition, they filed a Rule\n\n52(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., motion asking the court to amend the judgment against\n\nRatier, arguing that punitive damages cannot exceed $5 million under Kan. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 60-3702. Id. at 453, 461, 493-96.\n\n      The district court denied Defendants’ post-trial motions on these issues. At\n\nthe outset, the court concluded that, given the number of claims and issues\n\npresented by both parties, Defendants’ reference to their summary judgment\n\nbriefs in their oral Rule 50(a) motion did not preserve all sufficiency-of-the-\n\nevidence arguments for their Rule 50(b) motion. Id. at 1549-51. Rather, the\n\ncourt held that Defendants had preserved the sufficiency-of-the-evidence\n\n                                        -5-\n\farguments concerning only the breach of contract, fraud, and negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claims—the arguments that Defendants expressly argued in\n\ntheir Rule 50(a) motion. Id. The court then rejected Defendants’ arguments that\n\nRatier owned the trade secrets. Id. at 1557-59. In addition, the court concluded\n\nthat it properly awarded punitive damages against Ratier under KUTSA, which\n\npermits punitive damages up to twice the amount of compensatory damages.

Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 60-3702. In case number 10-3328, they contend that the district court\n\nimproperly awarded attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n                                     Discussion\n\nA.    Ownership of Trade Secrets\n\n      Defendants first argue that the district court erred in denying its Rule 50(b)\n\n                                        -6-\n\fmotion on ownership because Ratier owns the trade secrets either under the\n\ncommon-law hired-to-invent doctrine or as a matter of contract. Aplt. Br. 38-53.\n\nICE contends that ownership was a factual issue that was submitted to the jury\n\nand that Defendants have not preserved for appeal any sufficiency-of-the-\n\nevidence argument regarding ownership because they did not raise it in their Rule\n\n50(a) motion. Aplee. Br. 18-19. Defendants disagree, arguing that the district\n\ncourt denied summary judgment on ownership as a purely legal matter. Aplt.\n\nReply Br. 5-6.\n\n      After reviewing the record, we agree with ICE that ownership was a factual\n\nissue submitted to the jury and that Defendants did not preserve the issue for\n\nappeal. Before discussion, we explain in further detail how the ownership issue\n\nwas raised and addressed in the district court.\n\n      1.     Procedural History\n\n      Defendants moved for summary judgment on the issue of ownership,\n\narguing that Ratier owned all the trade secrets under the common-law hired-to-\n\ninvent doctrine. Aplt. App. 1221-22; Aplee. Supp. App. 160. Specifically,\n\nDefendants argued that the MOU was silent on the issue of ownership, and thus,\n\nthe court should look to common law to determine ownership. Under the\n\ncommon-law hired-to-invent doctrine, Defendants argued, “[i]f an employer pays\n\nyou to design, the employer owns the fruit of your labor.” Aplt. App. 1221\n\n(quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, they asserted that Ratier owned the\n\n                                        -7-\n\fresults of ICE’s work because Ratier hired ICE to design and develop the\n\npropeller deicing controller. Id. at 1222.\n\n      In response, ICE argued that the intent of the contracting parties is a\n\nquestion of fact for the jury and that “[all] of the evidence in this case proves that\n\nthe parties intended, understood and agreed that ICE owned its proprietary and\n\ntrade secret design work.” Id. at 1087-88, 1090. ICE argued that the MOU\n\nincorporated by reference ICE’s Supplier Quotation—which expressly states that\n\nICE’s design information was confidential and proprietary to ICE—and noted that\n\nevery witness addressing ownership during discovery understood that ICE owned\n\nthe trade secrets. Id. at 1088-89. In addition, ICE argued that the hired-to-invent\n\nauthority cited by Ratier did not apply. Id. at 1090-92.\n\n      Defendants responded, again arguing that the MOU was silent on\n\nownership and that the hired-to-invent doctrine should control. Id. at 1402-03. In\n\naddition, Defendants argued that the evidence presented at summary judgment\n\nconfirmed the parties’ understanding that Ratier owned any trade secrets\n\ndeveloped in connection with the deicing controller. Id.\n\n      In its decision denying summary judgment, the court engaged in two\n\nseparate analyses regarding the issue of ownership: (1) ownership under the hired-\n\nto-invent doctrine and (2) ownership based on the parties’ conduct and written\n\nagreements. Id. at 1508-13. The court distinguished the authority cited by\n\nDefendants concerning the hired-to-invent doctrine and concluded that the\n\n                                          -8-\n\fdoctrine does not apply to independent contractors hired to specifically design a\n\nproduct, such as ICE. Id. at 1508-12.\n\n      After addressing the hired-to-invent doctrine, the court then addressed\n\nownership based on the parties’ conduct and written agreements. Initially, the\n\ncourt stated that “[u]nder the facts and circumstances of this case, it is clear that\n\nICE owns the alleged trade secrets.” Id. at 1512 (footnote omitted). In reaching\n\nthis conclusion, the court relied on EDO Corp. v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 715 F.\n\nSupp. 990, 995 (D. Kan. 1988) for the proposition that a contract between parties\n\ncan dictate which party owns technology developed pursuant to the contract. The\n\ncourt then explained that the MOU incorporated by reference the Supplier\n\nQuotation and that the language of the Supplier Quotation—as well as the\n\nlanguage of another agreement entered into by ICE and Hamilton—supported the\n\ncontention that ICE owned the trade secrets. Aplt. App. 1512-13. In conclusion,\n\nthe court stated that “the parties’ conduct, as well as their written agreements, is\n\nsufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that ICE owns the alleged trade\n\nsecrets in this matter.” Id. at 1513 (emphasis added). We read this conclusion to\n\nmean that the district court determined there were genuine disputes as to material\n\nfact regarding ownership, despite its original presupposition.\n\n      What’s more, Defendants agreed to the following jury instruction\n\nexplaining the elements of ICE’s misappropriation claim:\n\n      ICE asserts a claim against both Hamilton and Ratier for violation of\n\n                                          -9-\n\f        the Kansas Trade Secrets Act. In order to prevail on this claim, ICE\n        must prove each of the following essential elements: . . .\n\n        2. ICE is the owner of the information.\n\nAplt. App. 298. Thus, ownership was treated as a factual issue submitted to the\n\njury.\n\n        ICE’s conduct at trial bolsters this conclusion. ICE presented the Supplier\n\nQuotation and other documents exchanged between the parties indicating that all\n\ninformation contained within the documents was confidential and proprietary.\n\nSee, e.g., Aplt. App. 675-709; Aplee. Supp. App. 739, 767, 802, 1450, 1467,\n\n1608, 1802-04. Witnesses for ICE testified that Defendants never expressed any\n\nconcern or disagreement with the legends on the documents. See, e.g., Aplee.\n\nSupp. App. 1450-51, 1467, 1601-02. In addition, ICE presented emails from\n\nHamilton representatives stating that “[w]e have a lot of detailed design\n\ninformation from ICE on what they were doing and it is not right for this\n\ninformation to be shared with their potential competitors,” id. at 976, 1552, 1557,\n\nand “I am very concerned about how much and what kind of technical information\n\nhas been transferred to these guys by [Ratier] . . . I just want to be sure that we\n\nare not violating any proprietary agreement with ICE,” id. at 1005, 1558.\n\n        On appeal, Defendants argue that in denying summary judgment the district\n\ncourt incorrectly decided as a matter of law that ICE owned the trade secrets.\n\nAplt. Br. 44-45; Aplt. Reply Br. 9. However, the court expressly stated that the\n\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\fparties’ conduct and their written agreements were sufficient for a reasonable jury\n\nto conclude that ICE owns the trade secrets. Aplt. App. 1513. Thus, the district\n\ncourt did not decide that ICE, as a matter of law, owned the trade secrets. Rather,\n\nthe district court denied Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the issue\n\nand submitted it to the jury because a reasonable jury could conclude that ICE\n\nowned the trade secrets under the agreements between the parties.\n\n      2.

Defendants have done neither. The district court held that\n\nDefendants failed to make such an argument in their Rule 50(a) motion, and\n\nDefendants have not challenged that point here. In addition, Defendants never\n\nmade a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument regarding ownership in their Rule\n\n50(b) motion. See Aplt. App. 361-65. Nor do they make that argument here.\n\nRather, they argued in their Rule 50(b) motion and before us that, as purely legal\n\nmatters, Ratier owned the trade secrets under the hired-to-invent doctrine or as a\n\nmatter of contract. Because Defendants failed to raise a sufficiency-of-the-\n\nevidence argument on ownership in their Rule 50(a) and 50(b) motions, we cannot\n\nreview the jury’s decision on ownership. Defendants’ failure to object to the jury\n\ninstruction on ownership further supports this conclusion of waiver. See Miller v.\n\nEby Realty Group LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165448\"><a href=\"/opinion/165448/miller-v-eby-realty-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1115 (10th Cir. 2005) (citing Atchley v.\n\nNordam Group, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1147-48 (10th Cir. 1999)).\n\n      Defendants contend that the jury decided a different ownership issue than\n\nthe one they present here, namely, whether the parties jointly developed the table\n\nof fault codes. Aplt. Reply Br. 6 n.1. In seeking summary judgment, Defendants\n\nargued—separately from their general ownership argument—that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that they misappropriated the table of fault\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fcodes because ICE did not own the fault codes. Aplt. App. 1240. The district\n\ncourt disagreed, concluding that there was a genuine issue of material fact\n\nregarding this issue. Id. at 1521. Although this issue was submitted to the jury,\n\nthere is no indication that it was the only ownership issue submitted for the jury\n\nto decide. See id. at 298. In addition, Defendants’ argument ignores the district\n\ncourt’s express statement that a reasonable jury could conclude the ICE owned all\n\nthe trade secrets pursuant to their conduct and agreements. Id. at 1513.\n\n      Defendants also contend that the court’s conclusion at summary judgment\n\nthat the hired-to-invent doctrine did not apply to ICE because ICE was an\n\nindependent contractor was decided as a matter of law and can be reviewed on\n\nappeal. Aplt. Reply Br. 8-9. Regardless of the court’s ruling on the hired-to-\n\ninvent doctrine, the court concluded that a reasonable jury could determine\n\nownership based on the parties’ conduct and written agreements. Thus, there is\n\nno need to look to the common-law hired-to-invent doctrine. 1 Indeed, Defendants\n\nhave repeatedly argued that the hired-to-invent doctrine does not apply if the\n\nagreement between the parties dictates otherwise. See, e.g., Aplt. Br. 44; Aplt.\n\nReply Br. 8; Aplt. App. 360, 1221-22. See also 27 Am. Jur. 2d Employment\n\nRelationship § 182 (2011) (hired-to-invent doctrine applies only absent an\n\nagreement to the contrary). The jury necessarily found that the ICE owned the\n\n      1\n         Because the issue submitted to the jury was whether ICE owned the trade\nsecrets based on the agreements and conduct between the parties, we need not\nopine on the district court’s analysis of the hired-to-invent doctrine.\n\n                                        - 13 -\n\ftrade secrets by agreement.\n\n       Accordingly, ownership of the trade secrets was submitted to the jury, and\n\nDefendants have not preserved a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument regarding\n\nthis issue.\n\nB.     Punitive Damages\n\n       Defendants contend that the district court erred in awarding punitive\n\ndamages of nearly $10 million against Ratier under KUTSA, arguing that the\n\ncourt’s award exceeds the $5 million cap imposed by Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3702.\n\nAplt. Br. 53-59. We review the district court’s interpretation of state law de\n\nnovo. Cooper v. Cent. & Sw. Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161785\"><a href=\"/opinion/161785/cooper-v-central-southwest/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1251 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\n       Section 60-3702 of Kansas’s general punitive damages statute governs “any\n\ncivil action in which exemplary or punitive damages are recoverable” and\n\nprovides that no award shall exceed the lesser of (1) the annual gross income\n\nearned by the defendant or (2) $5 million. Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3702(a), (e). The\n\nlesser amount here is $5 million. Section 60-3702(f) allows a court to exceed the\n\ncap upon a finding that profitability of a defendant’s misconduct exceeds or is\n\nexpected to exceed the cap, and award up to one-and-a-half times the amount of\n\nsuch profit. Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3702(f).\n\n       The punitive damages provision of KUTSA provides that “[i]f willful and\n\nmalicious misappropriation exists, the court may award exemplary damages in an\n\namount not exceeding twice any award [of compensatory damages].” Kan. Stat.\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fAnn. § 60-3322(b). Finding that the two statutes conflict and that KUTSA was\n\nthe more specific of the two, the district court applied KUTSA and awarded\n\n$9,590,600 in punitive damages against Ratier. ICE Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n1270-71, 1277. We cannot agree with this analysis.\n\n      At the outset, we reject ICE’s argument that § 60-3702 does not apply\n\nbecause it applies only to punitive damages awarded “pursuant to this section”\n\napparently referencing § 60-3702(e). Aplee. Br. 54. As stated above, § 60-\n\n3702(a) references “any civil action.” Notably, the district court relied upon the\n\nfactors set forth in § 60-3702(b) (which contains identical “pursuant to this\n\nsection” language) in awarding punitive damages. ICE Corp., 615 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n1271. Indeed, ICE argued in the district court that reliance upon these factors\n\nsupported the punitive damages award. Aplt. Supp. App. 1741.\n\n      Under Kansas law, “[g]eneral and special statutes should be read together\n\nand harmonized whenever possible, but to the extent a conflict between them\n\nexists, the special statute will prevail unless it appears the legislature intended to\n\nmake the general statute controlling.” State v.

Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 60-3702(e)\n\nand 3322(b) can be read together and harmonized such that in a trade secret\n\nmisappropriation action, punitive damages are limited to twice the amount of\n\ncompensatory damages up to $5 million. See Meitler Consulting, Inc. v. Dooley,\n\nNo. 05-2126-DJW, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1834008</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *14 (D.

Thus, although we recognize\n\nICE’s argument that KUTSA “displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary and other\n\nlaw of this state providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret,”\n\nsee Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3326(a), we do not see a conflict here.\n\n      Even if we perceived a conflict, the more general statutory cap applies here\n\nbecause it appears the Kansas legislature intended the more general cap to\n\ncontrol. Under Kansas law, “older statutes . . . are subordinate to new enactments\n\n. . . as the newer statute is the later expression of the legislative intent and so will\n\ncontrol if there is a possible conflict between the two.” Jones v.

Accordingly, § 60-3702 governs. 2\n\n      ICE argues that if § 60-3702 governs, then § 60-3702(f) justifies the\n\npunitive damages award over $5 million because Ratier is expected to realize\n\n\n      2\n         Following disposition of this issue in the district court, another Kansas\nfederal district court concluded that § 60-3702(a)’s bifurcated system of allowing\nthe jury to determine whether punitive damages can be recovered and then\nallowing the court to determine the amount of damages violates the Seventh\nAmendment because the Seventh Amendment requires that the jury be allowed to\ndetermine the amount of punitive damages.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1152, 1155-56 (D. Kan.\n2010). The district court in this case held otherwise. See ICE Corp., 615 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1269-70. The parties do not make any arguments on this issue on\nappeal, and we have no need to address it.\n\n                                          - 16 -\n\fprofits of between $85 and $139.5 million on the entire project. Aplee. Br. at 57-\n\n59; see also Aplt. Supp. App. 1746-47 (making same argument before district\n\ncourt). In order to award over $5 million dollars under § 60-3702 in this case,\n\nhowever, the court needed to make a finding that “the profitability of the\n\ndefendant’s misconduct exceeds or is expected to exceed” the $5 million cap. See\n\nKan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3702(f). The district court made no such finding because it\n\napplied the punitive damages provision in KUTSA. We therefore remand for the\n\ndistrict court to apply § 60-3702 and to consider whether the $5 million cap under\n\n§ 60-3072(e) or the larger cap under § 60-3702(f) applies. We note that to apply\n\nsubsection (f), the court must find that the profitability of Ratier’s\n\nmisconduct—not profitability from the entire project—exceeds or is expected to\n\nexceed $5 million.\n\nC.    Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In case number 10-3328, Defendants appeal the district court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees under KUTSA. 3\n\n      In its initial request for attorney’s fees, ICE requested $1,625,620.75 for\n\n8,843.65 hours of billable time. Aplt. App. 420. The district court granted in part\n\nand denied in part ICE’s motion, concluding that ICE could receive fees incurred\n\nprosecuting the misappropriation claims, but ordering ICE to segregate the time\n\n\n      3\n        The citations to the parties’ briefs and Appendices in this section refer to\nthose submitted for case 10-3328.\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\fspent on the misappropriation claims from the time spent on other, non-\n\ncompensable claims, and to then resubmit its request. Id. at 427-28.\n\n      ICE segregated its fee statements, eliminating any easily identifiable non-\n\ncompensable time entries and applying an across the board 30% reduction in\n\nhours to entries containing compensable and non-compensable claims where it\n\ncould not otherwise allocate time. Id. at 433-34. ICE also removed all time for\n\nthe first week of trial and eliminated six entries that it determined were\n\nduplications. Id. at 690. ICE subsequently requested $1,257,704.00 for 6,512.75\n\nhours of billable time. Id. at 434-35. The district court reduced the requested\n\namount by 880.85 hours—the time claimed by timekeepers for which ICE could\n\nnot establish a reasonable hourly rate—and awarded $1,134,438.25 in attorney’s\n\nfees.

We review the\n\nlegal principles underlying an award of attorney’s fees de novo, but the actual\n\naward of fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Combs v. Shelter Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171567\"><a href=\"/opinion/171567/combs-v-shelter-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1001 (10th Cir. 2008). In diversity cases, attorney’s fees are\n\ncontrolled by state law. Id. (citation omitted).\n\n       Under Kansas law, a court may award attorney fees if they are specifically\n\n                                         - 18 -\n\fallowed by statute. Hodges v.

A provision of KUTSA, which is identical to Section 4 of the\n\nUniform Trade Secrets Act (“UTSA”) provides that if “willful and malicious\n\nmisappropriation exists, the court may award reasonable attorney’s fees to the\n\nprevailing party.” Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-3323; see Unif. Trade Secrets Act § 4\n\n(2005). The jury found that the misappropriation was willful and malicious; thus,\n\nthe court had the discretion to award reasonable attorney’s fees. See Aplt. App.\n\n329-33.\n\n      Relying on a comment to Section 4 of UTSA which states that a court\n\n“should take into consideration the extent to which a complainant will recover\n\nexemplary damages in determining whether additional attorney’s fees should be\n\nawarded,” Defendants argue that the district court erred by not considering the\n\npunitive damages award when determining whether it could award attorney’s fees.\n\nSee Aplt.

App. 2009), where the Court of Appeals of Kansas\n\nlooked to the comments of UTSA to interpret a different provision of KUTSA.\n\nAplt. Br. 24-25. Even if a court should consider punitive damages in determining\n\nattorney’s fees, the district court did.\n\n      In its initial order addressing attorney’s fees, the district court concluded\n\nthat it could make such an award because the jury found that the misappropriation\n\n                                           - 19 -\n\fin this case was willful and malicious. Aplt. App. 419. The court also stated that\n\nit would consider the punitive damages award in its determination of\n\nreasonableness of fees, but not in its initial determination of whether it could\n\naward the fees under KUTSA. See id. at 420 n.10.\n\n      In a later order addressing the reasonableness of fees, however, the court\n\nparaphrased the Defendants’ argument and rejected it:\n\n      B. Defendants’ Request that the Court Deny Any Award of\n      Attorneys’ Fees\n\n             As an initial matter, the Court considers defendants’ argument\n      that the Court should altogether deny plaintiff reasonable attorneys’\n      fees because plaintiff already received a significant recovery in\n      compensatory and punitive damages. Since plaintiff’s counsel is\n      compensated in this case through a contingency fee arrangement,\n      defendants urge that the significant punitive damages award ensures\n      that plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees would not diminish its compensatory\n      damages award. To the extent defendants ask this Court to reconsider\n      its determination on plaintiff’s entitlement to reasonable attorneys’ fees\n      in this matter, the Court declines.\n\nICE Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4683981</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. We read the district court’s order as having\n\nexpressly rejected the Defendants’ argument.\n\n      Defendants argue that the district court awarded attorney’s fees based\n\nsolely upon the finding that the misappropriation was willful and malicious, but\n\nsuch a reading is contrary to the district court’s statement that it considered the\n\nargument and declined to change its mind. To be sure, more analysis would have\n\nbeen helpful, but we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion—the\n\ncomment is general and the district court apparently thought that the conduct at\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fissue justified an award of attorney’s fees notwithstanding the general enrichment\n\nof ICE.\n\n      Defendants also challenge the court’s reasonable fee determination. “In\n\nKansas, ‘[t]he reasonable value of attorney fees lies within the sound discretion of\n\nthe district court.’” Beck v.
