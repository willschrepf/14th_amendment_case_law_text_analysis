Ct. No. MSC09-01786)\n        Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n        Plaintiff Brian Cuevas, through his guardian ad litem, brought an action for\nmedical malpractice against defendant the County of Contra Costa, among others, arising\nout of injuries he sustained at birth. A jury awarded him $9,577,000 as the present cash\nvalue of his future medical and rehabilitation care expenses. Defendant appeals from the\ndamages verdict, asserting, among other things, that the trial court erred in excluding\nevidence that health insurance benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct (ACA) (Pub.L. No. 111-148 (Mar. 23, 2010) 124 Stat. 119) would be available to\nmitigate plaintiff’s future medical costs. We agree that the trial court erred in ruling that\nevidence of future ACA benefits is inadmissible. We reverse the judgment and remand\nthe case for a new trial on the amount of plaintiff’s future medical damages. In light of\nour conclusion, we also reverse the postjudgment orders awarding costs and expert fees.\n                FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nBackground\n        Because defendant does not contest the jury’s findings of liability and proximate\ncause, we need not address the facts of this case in great detail. Plaintiff suffered\n\firreversible brain damage in utero while his mother’s pregnancy was being managed by\nDr. Teresa Madrigal, a physician employed by defendant. Plaintiff is the surviving twin\nof a monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancy—a condition whereby identical twins share a\nplacenta, but have separate amniotic sacs.\n       When plaintiff’s mother reported for an appointment at 37 weeks and six days\npregnant, only one fetal heartbeat could be detected. She was transferred to a hospital by\nambulance, where the twins were delivered via caesarian section. Plaintiff’s twin had\ndied, and plaintiff had suffered a hypoxic brain injury. As a result, plaintiff has a very\nlow verbal IQ and will never be a functional reader. He also has serious language\ncommunication difficulties, significant behavioral problems, and has been diagnosed with\ncerebral palsy. Though he has severe developmental delay, he is sociable. He is toilet\ntrained and can walk, run, and feed himself. In the future, he will be able to feed, dress,\nand bathe himself. However, he will be dependent on others for his personal care and\nsafety for the rest of his life.\n       On April 19, 2010, plaintiff, through his guardian ad litem, filed a first amended\ncomplaint (FAC) against Contra Costa County Health Services and 13 other defendant\nhealth care providers and medical centers. The FAC alleges two causes of action:\n(1) medical malpractice as to plaintiff, and (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress as\nto his mother.1 Plaintiff’s theory at trial was that he sustained his injury because\nMadrigal breached the applicable standard of care by failing to schedule his delivery\nprior to 37 weeks’ gestation. The case was tried to a jury, which found in plaintiff’s\nfavor on liability. Defendant does not contest this finding on appeal.\nPlaintiff’s and Defendant’s Life Care Plans\n       During discovery, plaintiff disclosed a life care plan prepared by Jan Roughan, in\nwhich she provided her opinion as to the kind of medical and rehabilitative care he will\n\n\n       1\n           Plaintiff’s mother’s claims are not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                                 2\n\fneed for the rest of his life, along with the projected costs for each specific care item.\nHer plan was based on the recommendations of medical specialists who testified on\nplaintiff’s behalf. As to future medical costs, the plan does not account for service\ndiscounts associated with Medi-Cal, even though plaintiff is currently receiving Medi-Cal\nbenefits. Nor does it reflect negotiated discounts that would potentially be available\nunder insurance procured through the ACA. Instead, Roughan determined future costs\nfor plaintiff’s medical care by referencing a national database that reflects the average\ncharges billed for each type of service.\n       Defendant’s life care planner, Linda Olzack, prepared life care plans based on\nservices recommended by a defense pediatric neurologist. In contrast to Roughan,\nOlzack’s plans reflect three alternate cost scenarios, including one in which plaintiff\nwould continue to be covered by Medi-Cal, one in which he would procure private\ninsurance under the ACA, and one in which he would pay for his expenses out of pocket.\nWith respect to the private pay scenario, Olzack did not rely on amounts billed by\nhealthcare providers in calculating future medical expenses. Instead, she contacted local\nhealth care providers and asked them how much individuals without insurance are\nrequired to pay. These rates typically are less than what providers would state on a bill.\n       Olzack’s alternative plans reflect the wide variations that presently exist in\nmedical charging practices. Her Medi-Cal life care plan reflects reimbursement rates that\nappear to be substantially lower than the rates paid by persons without insurance. For\nexample, one category of expenses reflects a more than 60 percent difference between the\nprivate pay rate and the Medi-Cal rate. Within her plans, she also took into consideration\nthe free benefits that plaintiff is currently entitled to receive from the regional center and\npublic school system.\n       Olzack also prepared a report comparing the costs for the services itemized in\nRoughan’s plan with the Medi-Cal payment rate for the same goods and services,\nrevealing that Roughan’s costs were substantially higher. For example, the cost for a\n\n                                               3\n\fwide variety of physician visits listed in Roughan’s plan were four to six times higher\nthan the corresponding Medi-Cal rates.2\nEvidentiary Rulings\n       On January 10, 2014, plaintiff filed various motions in limine, including one\nseeking to exclude evidence of collateral source payments from Medi-Cal and other\npublic sources, and another to exclude evidence of future collateral sources. Plaintiff also\nfiled a motion to exclude evidence, opinion, or argument regarding any possible future\nmedical benefits available through ACA-mandated insurance. In part, plaintiff asserted\nthat Civil Code section 3333.1 (section 3333.1), a statute contained within the Medical\nInjury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA), does not allow the introduction of evidence\nregarding future collateral source medical benefits. He contended defendant’s expert\nshould be prohibited from offering opinions as to such evidence.\n       On July 14, 2014, defendant filed further briefing on the issue of future medical\nbenefits. In support of its argument that evidence of prospective ACA benefits should be\noffered to the jury, it included a declaration prepared by Thomas J. Dawson, an expert on\nthe ACA and regulatory and health care policy, who worked for the United States House\nof Representatives during the passage of the ACA and was directly involved in\nnegotiating key provisions of the legislation.\n       After hearing argument, the trial court ruled that defendant could not present as a\ncollateral-source offset any evidence concerning publicly funded benefits available\nthrough regional centers and the public school system. Relying on section 3333.1, it also\nruled defendant could not introduce any evidence of Medi-Cal benefits, nor could it\nintroduce evidence of ACA insurance benefits. With respect to Medi-Cal, the court ruled\nthat Medi-Cal is not subject to MICRA’s exception to the collateral source rule. With\n\n       2\n        Roughan also estimated the cost of a surgical procedure to correct plaintiff’s\nstrabismus (crossed eyes) at $14,785. Olzack’s report stated that the Medi-Cal\nreimbursement rate for this procedure would be only $4,527.\n\n                                             4\n\frespect to the ACA, the court also reasoned: “I believe that there is no reasonable\ncertainty that that benefit will be in place, and that’s something that—you have to cross\nthat barrier in order to be considered as something that should be presented to the jury for\nfactual consideration.”\n       On August 28, 2014, defendant filed a request for clarification regarding the\npresentation of evidence as to plaintiff’s future medical expenses. Specifically, it\nasserted Roughan had relied on “inflated” billed amounts in calculating the cost of\nplaintiff’s future medical care, rather than the lower amounts providers actually accept as\nfull payment. Defendant questioned whether the trial court had intended to allow the\nintroduction of such evidence when it made its earlier rulings on plaintiff’s motions in\nlimine. Defendant suggested the evidence should instead be limited to the amounts\nhealth care providers will accept in the future as full payment.\n       Defendant noted Roughan’s life care plan did not reflect the substantially lower\namounts that would be accepted as full payment under Medi-Cal or private insurance.3 It\nrelied heavily on Howell v. Hamilton Meats & Provisions, Inc. (2011) 52 Cal.4th 541\n(Howell) and Corenbaum v. Lampkin (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1308 (Corenbaum) in\narguing that plaintiff’s recovery should be limited to the amount he proves is likely to be\npaid to providers for his future medical care, not the amount his providers are likely to\nbill. It contended that the billed rates reflected in Roughan’s plan were therefore\ninadmissible.\n       Defendant also asked whether it would be allowed to introduce evidence\nconcerning the range of amounts healthcare providers accept as full payment, without\nmaking reference to the actual sources (i.e., Medi-Cal or private insurance) of those\npayments. Defendant asserted that introducing these reduced amounts “would assist the\n\n\n       3\n         The parties stipulated that plaintiff’s medical expenses up to the time of trial\ntotaled $55,780.\n\n                                              5\n\fjury in evaluating the reasonable value of plaintiff’s future medical care, without\nviolating the collateral source rule by disclosing the third party source of payment.” It\nreasoned “[t]he fact that Medi-Cal does not fall within the exception to the collateral\nsource rule of MICRA is completely separate from the issue of whether the County may\nintroduce evidence regarding the amounts Medi-Cal will pay for a service, without\nreferencing the source of payment. In the former scenario, the County would be seeking\nto be completely relieved from paying for a service that Medi-Cal will cover, while in the\nlatter, the County simply seeks to provide the jury with all of the information needed to\ndetermine the reasonable value of plaintiff’s future medical care.”\n       The trial court stated that it would allow evidence of Roughan’s reliance on the\nnational database to project plaintiff’s medical costs into the future “because it’s not\nrelying on past billed amounts.” The court also indicated it would permit Olzack to\ntestify that she had based her own calculations on the lower amounts that are accepted by\nhealthcare providers under certain circumstances (the private pay scenario). However,\ndefendant would not be allowed to attempt to establish that future billed amounts do not\nreflect the amounts that will actually be accepted by the providers.\n       Defendant also sought a modified version of CACI No. 3903A (with the\nmodification italicized): “To recover damages for future medical expenses, plaintiff\nBrian Cuevas must prove the reasonable cost of reasonably necessary medical care that\nhe is reasonably certain to need in the future. The damages awarded for future medical\nexpenses cannot exceed the amount that is reasonably certain to be owed or paid to\nplaintiff’s healthcare providers in the future for that care.” The trial court rejected\ndefendant’s proposed modification.\nEvidence Offered at Trial\n       Roughan’s life care plan was admitted in evidence during her testimony.\nSubsequently, Olzack was permitted to testify about her private-pay life care plan, the\nonly version of her three plans that the trial court allowed into evidence. Olzack noted\n\n                                              6\n\fthat her plan identifies the providers her office contacted to obtain her cost estimates. As\nto the specific services listed for future medical care, her task was not to make care\nrecommendations, but only to determine how much the recommended services will cost.\nUnlike Roughan, Olzack did not rely on the charged amounts that appear in national\nhealth care cost databases. Notwithstanding their different approaches, Olzack’s private-\npay plan reflects essentially the same costs as Roughan’s plan for many life care\ncategories.\n       Based on a projected remaining life expectancy of 74 years, plaintiff’s economist\ncalculated the total value of his future care expenses under Roughan’s life care plan to be\n$285 million, with a present value of nearly $29 million. In contrast, defendant’s\neconomist took the rates to which Olzack was permitted to testify and concluded that the\npresent value of plaintiff’s future service needs totaled somewhere between $3,233,670\nand $3,340,222. Defendant claims these estimates would have been significantly lower if\nOlzack had been able to factor into her analysis the free benefits plaintiff receives from\nthe regional center and the school system, as well as discounted medical care rates that\nwould apply under Medi-Cal or a private insurance policy.\nJury Instructions and Verdict\n       The jury found in favor of plaintiff and awarded $100 million for future medical,\nhospital, surgical, and rehabilitation care expenses, which it reduced to $9,577,000 in\npresent cash value. The total represents approximately one-third of what plaintiff had\nsought, and about three times the total in the private pay version of Olzack’s plan that the\ntrial court admitted into evidence. Following posttrial motions, defendant appealed from\nthe judgment and postjudgment orders awarding plaintiff costs and expert witness fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\nI.     Issues and Standard of Review\n       On appeal, defendant asserts the trial court committed four categories of error, all\npertaining to its rulings regarding evidence of the costs for plaintiff’s future care.4\nDefendant claims the court erred in (1) barring evidence under section 3333.1 of future\nbenefits that will be available to plaintiff through the ACA; (2) ruling that his future\nmedical expenses could be based upon figures derived from billed rates; (3) relying on\nthe collateral source rule to exclude evidence concerning insurance benefits available\nunder the ACA; and (4) relying on the collateral source rule to exclude evidence of free\nregional center and educational benefits.\n       Trial courts ordinarily enjoy broad discretion with respect to the admission and\nexclusion of evidence in ruling on motions in limine. (Katiuzhinsky v. Perry (2007)\n152 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1294.) Nonetheless, that discretion “is limited by the legal\nprinciples applicable to the case.” (Ibid.) Where a trial court’s exclusion or admission of\nevidence “ ‘ “ ‘transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law,’ ” ’ ” it is an\nabuse of discretion. (Ibid.) Thus, to determine whether the trial court abused its\ndiscretion here, we must first determine what the law permits and requires with respect to\nthe recovery of future medical damages under MICRA.\n\n\n       4\n         Plaintiff asserts defendant cannot show prejudice because it did not ask the jury\nto segregate the elements of his future medical damages. By constitutional mandate, we\ncannot reverse a judgment based on instructional error, evidentiary error, or procedural\nerror unless, based on “an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence,” we\nare “of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.”\n(Cal. Const., art. VI, § 13.) Under this standard, a trial court’s errors require reversal if it\nis reasonably probable that they affected the verdict. (College Hospital Inc. v. Superior\nCourt (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 715.) “We have made clear that a ‘probability’ in this\ncontext does not mean more likely than not, but merely a reasonable chance, more than\nan abstract possibility.” (Ibid.) We conclude defendant’s claims raise more than an\n“abstract possibility” as to the effects of the alleged errors on the damages awarded, and\nelect to address its arguments on their merits.\n\n                                               8\n\fII.    The Collateral Source Rule and Section 3333.1\n       The collateral source rule provides that “ ‘if an injured party received some\ncompensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor, such\npayment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff would otherwise\ncollect from the tortfeasor.’ [Citation.] Therefore, the collateral source rule precludes a\ndefendant from presenting evidence that an injured plaintiff’s medical expenses have\nbeen paid by an independent source. [Citation.] While the rule may effectively allow a\nplaintiff to receive a double recovery, ‘ “[t]he collateral source rule expresses a policy\njudgment in favor of encouraging citizens to purchase and maintain insurance for\npersonal injuries and for other eventualities. . . . To permit the defendant to tell the jury\nthat the plaintiff has been recompensed by a collateral source for his medical costs might\nirretrievably upset the complex, delicate, and somewhat indefinable calculations which\nresult in the normal jury verdict. . . .” ’ ” (Hernandez v. California Hospital Medical\nCenter (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 498, 504–505 (Hernandez).)\n       In response to a medical malpractice insurance crisis in California, the Legislature\nin 1975 adopted MICRA. (Barme v. Wood (1984) 37 Cal.3d 174, 178–179 (Barme).)\nSection 3333.1 alters the collateral source rule in medical malpractice cases. A medical\nmalpractice defendant may introduce evidence of “any amount payable as a benefit to the\nplaintiff as a result of the personal injury pursuant to the United States Social Security\nAct, any state or federal income disability or worker’s compensation act, any health,\nsickness or income-disability insurance, accident insurance that provides health benefits\nor income-disability coverage, and any contract or agreement of any group, organization,\npartnership, or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of medical, hospital,\ndental, or other health care services.” (§ 3333.1, subd. (a), fn. omitted.) If the medical\nmalpractice defendant introduces evidence of the plaintiff’s collateral source benefits, the\nplaintiff may introduce evidence of any payments made to obtain these benefits. (Ibid.)\nThis section also provides that “[n]o source of collateral benefits introduced pursuant to\n\n                                              9\n\fsubdivision (a) shall recover any amount against the plaintiff nor shall it be subrogated to\nthe rights of the plaintiff against a defendant.” (§ 3333.1, subd. (b).) Under section\n3333.1, the jury is informed of collateral source benefits and may elect not to award\ndamages that duplicate those benefits. (Barme, at p. 179, fn. 5.)\n       Courts have held that section 3333.1 does not apply to payments made on behalf\nof an injured party by Medi-Cal (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 14000 et seq.).5 (Hernandez,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 506.) In Brown v. Stewart (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 331, 341\n(Brown), the appellate court concluded that applying section 3333.1 to Medicaid\npayments for medical services would create a direct conflict with provisions of federal\nlaw that require states to seek reimbursement of Medicaid payments from third party\ntortfeasors. Therefore, the collateral source rule continues to apply in medical\nmalpractice cases as to Medi-Cal payments.\nIII.   Evidence Regarding Future Benefits Is Admissible Under Section 3333.1\n       A. Section 3333.1 Is Ambiguous with Respect to Awards of Future Damages\n       The trial court ruled that section 3333.1 does not allow the introduction of\nevidence regarding future health insurance benefits—only past benefits. Defendant\nasserts that section 3333.1 allows the introduction of future as well as past collateral\nsource medical benefits, thereby allowing the jury to decide whether to reduce a\nplaintiff’s damages award for future medical expenses.\n       The issue is one of statutory interpretation. A court’s “primary task in interpreting\na statute is to determine the Legislature’s intent, giving effect to the law’s purpose.\n[Citation.] [The court] consider[s] first the words of a statute, as the most reliable\nindicator of legislative intent. [Citation.] ‘ “ ‘Words must be construed in context, and\nstatutes must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent\n\n\n       5\n        “Medi-Cal is California’s implementation of the federal Medicaid program.”\n(Howell, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 553, fn. 3.)\n\n                                             10\n\fpossible.’ ” ’ ” (Tuolumne Jobs & Small Business Alliance v. Superior Court (2014)\n59 Cal.4th 1029, 1037.) If, however, “ ‘the statutory language may reasonably be given\nmore than one interpretation, “ ‘ “courts may consider various extrinsic aids, including\nthe purpose of the statute, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,\nand the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.” ’ ” ’ ” (People v. Cornett (2012)\n53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265.)\n         Again, section 3333.1 provides, in relevant part: “In the event the defendant so\nelects . . ., he may introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff\nas a result of the personal injury pursuant to the United States Social Security Act, any\nstate or federal income disability or worker’s compensation act, any health, sickness or\nincome-disability insurance, accident insurance that provides health benefits or income-\ndisability coverage, and any contract or agreement of any group, organization,\npartnership, or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of medical, hospital,\ndental, or other health care services. Where the defendant elects to introduce such\nevidence, the plaintiff may introduce evidence of any amount which the plaintiff has paid\nor contributed to secure his right to any insurance benefits concerning which the\ndefendant has introduced evidence.” (§ 3333.1, subd. (a), italics added, fn. omitted.)\nDefendant argues that the statute’s use of the term “amount payable,” instead of “amount\npaid,” “contemplates that evidence of future benefits should be admissible as well.”6 We\nagree.\n         While the meaning of “paid” as used in subdivision (a) of this section is clear, in\nthat it references that amount which a plaintiff has already paid to obtain insurance\nbenefits, we agree with defendant that “amount payable” is ambiguous insofar as it could\napply to amounts that will be payable in the future as well as to amounts that were\n\n         6\n         Amici curiae the California Medical Association, California Dental Association,\nand California Hospital Association, on behalf of defendant, assert that the plain language\nof section 3333.1, subdivision (a), “applies to economic damages ‘payable’ in the future.”\n\n                                              11\n\fpayable in the past.7 An argument can be made that “amount payable” should be\nrestricted to past medical expenses because the statute only includes an offset for those\npremiums that a plaintiff has already “paid or contributed.” However, section 3333.1\ndoes not explicitly limit the presentation of a defendant’s evidence to past benefits.\n       Preliminarily, we observe we are not alone in entertaining the notion that section\n3333.1 permits the introduction of evidence of future collateral source benefits that a\nplaintiff is likely to receive. A footnote in Fein v. Permanente Medical Group (1985)\n38 Cal.3d 137, 165 (Fein) supports the conclusion that available medical insurance can\nbe used by the jury to reduce a medical malpractice plaintiff’s future medical damages\naward.8 (Fein, at p.165, fn. 21.) In Fein, the trial court used an anomalous procedure in\nimplementing section 3333.1. It did not permit evidence of collateral source benefits to\nbe introduced into evidence. Rather, because the amount of such benefits was not in\ndispute, the court ruled that it would simply reduce the verdict by the amount of the\nbenefits. Neither party objected. (Fein, at pp. 146, fn. 2, 165, fn. 21.) Thereafter, the\njury awarded, inter alia, $63,000 in future medical expenses, and the trial court ordered\nthe defendant to pay the first $63,000 of those expenses “not covered by medical\ninsurance provided by plaintiff’s employer, as such expenses were incurred.” (Id. at\npp. 145–146.)\n       Although this reimbursement procedure was not raised as an issue on appeal, the\nSupreme Court observed in the footnote referenced above that the plaintiff did “raise a\n\n\n       7\n        Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary defines “payable” as “that may, can, or\nmust be paid.” (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/payable, as of Apr. 27,\n2017.)\n       8\n         Plaintiff’s cites to two passages from Howell, supra, 52 Cal.4th 541 asserting\nthat the court’s “consistent use of the past tense in describing the operation of [section\n3333.1] leaves little doubt about the court’s view that the section does not apply to future\nbenefits.” The assertion is not persuasive as the court was clearly not intending to\naddress the proposition that plaintiff advances.\n\n                                             12\n\fminor contention . . . which is somewhat related to this matter.” (Fein, supra, 38 Cal.3d\nat p. 165, fn. 21.) The court explained: “In awarding damages applicable to plaintiff’s\nfuture medical expenses, the trial court indicated that defendant was to pay the first\n$63,000 of such expenses that were not covered by employer-provided medical\ninsurance. Plaintiff, pointing out that he may not be covered by medical insurance in the\nfuture, apparently objects to any reduction of future damages on the basis of potential\nfuture collateral source benefits. Under the terms of the trial court’s judgment, however,\ndefendant’s liability for such damages will be postponed only if plaintiff does in fact\nreceive such collateral benefits; thus, it is difficult to see how plaintiff has any cause to\ncomplain about this aspect of the award. Indeed, if anything, the trial court may have\ngiven plaintiff more than he was entitled to, since it did not reduce the jury’s $63,000\naward by the collateral source benefits plaintiff was likely to receive, but instead imposed\na continuing liability on defendant to pay up to a total of $63,000 for any noncovered\nmedical expenses that plaintiff may incur in the future as a result of the injury.\nDefendant has not objected to this portion of the judgment.” (Ibid., first italics in orig.,\nsecond italics added.)\n       Concededly, the relevant language in Fein appears to be dicta; however, in support\nof its argument, defendant also draws our attention to several federal court cases holding\nthat section 3333.1 allows the admission of evidence of future insurance benefits. In\nBrewington v. United States (C.D.Cal. July 24, 2015, No. CV 13-07672-DMG (CWx))\n2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97720 (Brewington), the district court concluded section 3333.1\napplies to future benefits, and held that evidence concerning future benefits could be\nintroduced at trial. (Id. at pp. *16–*17.) However, that decision noted the Ninth Circuit\nhad not yet explicitly held that section 3333.1 applies to actions under the Federal Tort\nClaims Act (28 U.S.C. § 2671 et seq.). (Brewington, at p. *17.) Nevertheless, it relied on\nunpublished California authority and a district court case, Silong v. United States\n(E.D.Cal. Sept. 5, 2007) 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68724, at pp. *13–*18 (Silong), in\n\n                                              13\n\ffinding it “appropriate to take insurance benefits available under the ACA into\nconsideration in calculating reasonable future life care plan needs.” (Brewington, at\np. *17.)9 Because we conclude the term “amount payable” is ambiguous, we turn to\nextrinsic interpretation aids.\n       B. Purpose of MICRA and Public Policy\n       We recently had occasion to reflect on the significant reform created by MICRA\nlegislation. “ ‘In May 1975, the Governor—citing serious problems that had arisen\nthroughout the state as a result of a rapid increase in medical malpractice insurance\npremiums—convened the Legislature in extraordinary session to consider measures\naimed at remedying the situation. In response, the Legislature enacted . . . MICRA . . ., a\nlengthy statute which attacked the problem on several fronts.’ [Citation.] ‘In broad\noutline, the act . . . sought to curtail unwarranted insurance premium increases by\nauthorizing alternative insurance coverage programs and by establishing new procedures\nto review substantial rate increases, and . . . attempted to reduce the cost and increase the\nefficiency of medical malpractice litigation by revising a number of legal rules applicable\nto such litigation.’ ” (Chan v. Curran (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 601, 607, fn. omitted; see\nAmerican Bank & Trust Co. v. Community Hospital (1984) 36 Cal.3d 359, 363–364.)\n       Defendant asserts that as a matter of practice and policy, maintaining a distinction\nbetween past and future insurance benefits “makes no sense” because of the public’s\nstrong interest in containing medical malpractice liability. We note “[t]he cases agree\nthat MICRA provisions should be construed liberally in order to promote the legislative\ninterest in negotiated resolution of medical malpractice disputes and to reduce\n\n\n\n       9\n         Another federal case cited to by defendant in its reply brief assumed, without\ndeciding, that section 3333.1 applies to future collateral source benefits. (S.H. v. United\nStates (E.D.Cal. Oct. 29, 2014, Civ. No 2:11-cv-01963-MCE-DAD) 2014 Dist. LEXIS\n154222.) The court noted, however, that the issue “does not appear to have a clear\nanswer.” (Id. at p. *9.)\n\n                                             14\n\fmalpractice insurance premiums.” (Preferred Risk Mutual Ins. Co. v. Reiswig (1999)\n21 Cal.4th 208, 215.)\n       As the Supreme Court stated in Fein: “Because section 3333.1, subdivision (a) is\nlikely to lead to lower malpractice awards, there can be no question but that this provision\n. . . directly relates to MICRA’s objective of reducing the costs incurred by malpractice\ndefendants and their insurers. And, as we have seen, the Legislature could reasonably\nhave determined that the reduction of such costs would serve the public interest by\npreserving the availability of medical care throughout the state and by helping to assure\nthat patients who were injured by medical malpractice in the future would have a source\nof medical liability insurance to cover their losses.” (Fein, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 166.)\nInterpreting the statute as abrogating the collateral source rule with respect to future\nmedical benefits as well as past benefits is consistent with the legislative purpose of\nreducing malpractice insurance costs.\n       C. Legislative History\n       The legislative history of section 3333.1 also supports our conclusion, as it\nsuggests the Legislature intended to allow evidence of benefits payable both in the past\nand in the future.10\n       Assembly Bill No. 1 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess.) (Assem. Bill 1) was enacted and\ncodified as section 3333.1. All of Assem. Bill 1’s predecessor bills, including Assembly\nBill Nos. 21 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess., as introduced May 28, 1975 (Assem. Bill 21), § 2)\nand 27 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess.) as introduced June 2, 1975 (Assem. Bill 27), § 2),\nidentified the Legislature’s desire to eliminate duplicative damages, including duplicative\nfuture damages, “for the cost of medical care in actions for personal injuries against\nhealth care providers or health care institutions when such care has already been or will\n\n\n       10\n         We grant defendant’s request for judicial notice of the legislative history of\nsection 3333.1.\n\n                                             15\n\fbe provided by a collateral source.” (Sen. Bill No. 697 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as\namended May 13, 1975 (Sen. Bill 697), § 3, subd. (d), italics added; accord Assem.\nBill 21; Assem. Bill No. 22 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess.) as amended Aug. 4, 1975 (Assem.\nBill 22), § 3, subd. (c); Assem. Bill 27; Assem. Bill No. 1997 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as\nintroduced Apr. 21, 1975, § 2; see also Assem. Bill No. 1943 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as\nintroduced Apr. 17, 1975, § 2, containing substantially similar language.)\n       While “[p]rior unpassed bills generally have little value in showing legislative\nintent” (Medical Board v. Superior Court (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 163, 181), here the\npredecessor bills are instructive. This is because the Assembly Committee on Judiciary\nacknowledged the relationship between Assem. Bill 1 and its predecessor bills, stating\nthat Assem. Bill 1 “incorporates the concepts or language of the following assembly bills\nintroduced during the regular or special session,” referencing Assem. Bills 21 and 27.\nSince the adopted bill, Assem. Bill 1, incorporated “the concepts or language” of the\nprior bills, it is not unreasonable to conclude the legislative intent to extend the statute’s\nreach to future damages was adopted as well.11\n       And while the Legislature used the past tense in section 3333.1, subdivision (a)\nwith respect to a plaintiff’s right to offer evidence regarding the amount he or she “has\npaid or contributed” to secure a collateral source benefit, prior versions of the bills,\nincluding those that expressly provided that a defendant could introduce evidence of\nfuture care that “will be provided by a collateral source,” contained this same language\nconcerning the amount a plaintiff “has . . . paid or contributed.” (Sen. Bill 697; Assem.\nBill 22.) This suggests the Legislature did not understand the use of “paid or\ncontributed” to restrict the term “amount payable” to past collateral source benefits only.\nFurther, our interpretation is consistent with the cardinal principle of statutory\n\n\n       11\n          We disagree with plaintiff’s contention that the Legislature’s statements of\nintent should be ignored because they were omitted from Assem. Bill 1.\n\n                                              16\n\fconstruction that “ ‘we are required to give it an interpretation based upon the legislative\nintent with which it was passed.’ ” (Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972)\n8 Cal.3d 247, 256.) In sum, we conclude section 3333.1 permits the introduction of\nevidence regarding future as well as past medical benefits. The trial court thus erred in\nrelying on this section to bar defendant from introducing evidence of future benefits.12\n       D. The Collateral Source Rule and Howell\n       Defendant asserts the trial court erred independent of section 3333.1 by relying on\nthe collateral source rule to exclude evidence of the ACA and the amounts that healthcare\nproviders typically accept as payment for their services. Defendant relies on Howell,\nsupra, 52 Cal.4th 541 for the proposition that negotiated payment amounts and “the\nACA’s guaranteed issue and renewal requirements are highly probative because they . . .\nare ‘of substantial probative value’ in determining the reasonable value of plaintiff’s\nmedical services.”13 Defendant’s reasoning is persuasive.\n       Howell addressed whether a plaintiff could recover from a tortfeasor economic\ndamages for amounts billed by a medical provider in excess of the discounted sum the\nprovider agreed to accept as full payment for past medical services pursuant to a\npreexisting contract with the plaintiff’s health insurance carrier. Howell ultimately\nconcluded the plaintiff was limited to recovering the amount actually paid on his behalf\nbecause the billed amounts did not represent an economic loss the plaintiff incurred.\n(Howell, supra, 52 Cal.4th at pp. 548–549.)\n       The Howell court explained it was not abrogating or modifying the collateral\nsource rule, it simply found the rule inapplicable: “The rule . . . has no bearing on\n\n\n       12\n          In fairness to the trial court, it is notable that section 3333.1 was enacted in 1975\nyet it appears no reported California state appellate decision has squarely addressed the\nstatute’s application to future medical damages awards.\n       13\n        Defendant also relies on two out-of-state cases that deal with past medical\ndamages, not future medical damages, and are therefore not on point.\n\n                                              17\n\famounts that were included in a provider’s bill but for which the plaintiff never incurred\nliability because the provider, by prior agreement, accepted a lesser amount as full\npayment. Such sums are not damages the plaintiff would otherwise have collected from\nthe defendant. They are neither paid to the providers on the plaintiff’s behalf nor paid to\nthe plaintiff in indemnity of his or her expenses. Because they do not represent an\neconomic loss for the plaintiff, they are not recoverable in the first instance.” (Howell,\nsupra, 52 Cal.4th at pp. 548–549.) Howell affirmed the vitality of the evidentiary aspect\nof the collateral source rule, stating evidence that “payments were made in whole or in\npart by an insurer remains . . . generally inadmissible.” (Id. at p. 567.) The court\ndeclined to opine as to the relevance or admissibility of the full billed amount with\nrespect to noneconomic damages or future medical expenses. (Ibid.)\n       The appellate court in Corenbaum addressed issues left open in Howell, supra,\n52 Cal.4th at page 567. The court held evidence of the full amount billed for a plaintiff’s\nmedical care is not relevant to damages for future medical care or noneconomic damages,\nconcluding that the admission of such evidence was error. (Corenbaum, supra,\n215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1319, 1330–1333.) The court reasoned the trial court’s erroneous\nadmission of such evidence was prejudicial in that case because the record “clearly\ndemonstrate[d]” that the damages awards were based on the full amount billed and not on\nthe lesser amount the plaintiff’s medical providers had accepted as full payment. (Id. at\np. 1333.) The court reversed and remanded for a new trial limited to the issue of\ncompensatory damages. (Id. at pp. 1333–1334.)\n       A recent case from the Second Appellate District, Markow v. Rosner (2016)\n3 Cal.App.5th 1027 (Markow), cites to Howell and Corenbaum, explaining: “Our\nSupreme Court has endorsed a market or exchange value as the proper way to think about\nthe reasonable value of medical services. [Citation.] This applies to the calculation of\nfuture medical expenses. [Citation.] For insured plaintiffs, the reasonable market or\nexchange value of medical services will not be the amount billed by a medical provider\n\n                                             18\n\for hospital, but the ‘amount paid pursuant to the reduced rate negotiated by the plaintiff’s\ninsurance company.’ ” (Markow, at pp. 1050–1051.)\n       In Markow, the plaintiffs’ life care planning expert estimated that the amount\nbilled for the injured party’s future hospitalizations would be approximately $2 million.\nShe also testified that the amount actually paid is usually 50 to 75 percent of the total\namount billed, while noting that with respect to one particular hospitalization, the injured\nparty’s cost had been reimbursed at a much lower rate of 12.9 percent. She also testified\nthat “reimbursement rates vary and that there is no one ‘across-the-board, set\npercentage.’ ” (Markow, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 1051.) The jury awarded $1.3\nmillion for the cost of future hospitalizations, which the defendant claimed was excessive\nbecause the plaintiffs’ expert did not consider amounts actually paid for hospitalization.\n(Id. at p. 1050.) If the jury had applied the 12.9 percent rate, he argued, the award for\nfuture hospitalizations would have been reduced to $260,000. (Id. at p. 1051.) Citing the\nexpert testimony, the appellate court found substantial evidence supported the jury’s\naward of $1.3 million, which was roughly halfway between the expert’s 50 to 75 percent\nreimbursement figure. (Ibid.) These cases support the conclusion that the collateral\nsource rule is not violated when a defendant is allowed to offer evidence of the market\nvalue of future medical benefits.\n       IV. The ACA\n       In a related argument, defendant further faults the trial court for preventing it from\nintroducing evidence of future benefits that will be available to plaintiff under the ACA\nbased on its conclusion that it was speculative to assume the ACA will continue to exist.\nIt is noteworthy that this case was briefed before the 2016 presidential election, the\naftermath of which did place the ACA’s continued viability into question. However, in\nspite of recent efforts to abolish or substantially alter the ACA, as of the writing of this\nopinion the ACA remains essentially intact.\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f         Defendant’s expert Dawson’s declaration supports the proposition that plaintiff\nwill be able to acquire comprehensive health care insurance going forward. In other\nwords, it provides a defense expert assessment of the availability of insurance benefits\ncompatible with defense health care expert Olzack’s analysis of sources to finance\nplaintiff’s future need satisfaction. Dawson opined that the ACA is reasonably certain to\ncontinue well into the future and that plaintiff will be able to acquire comprehensive\nhealth insurance notwithstanding his disability. Dawson reviewed Roughan’s and\nOlzack’s life care plans and compared them both to plaintiff’s current Medi-Cal coverage\nand to insurance available on the Covered California health care exchange. Dawson\nidentified specific California insurance plans that would be available to meet many of his\nneeds. He also explained that plaintiff could use funds held in his special needs trust to\npurchase private health insurance, in which case private insurance would pay first, and\nMedi-Cal would have a right to reimbursement from the corpus of the trust only upon his\ndeath.\n         Defendant presented evidence sufficient to support the continued viability of the\nACA, as well as its application to plaintiff’s circumstances. Accordingly, we conclude\nthe trial court’s decision to exclude evidence of future insurance benefits that might be\navailable under the ACA on the basis that the ACA is unlikely to continue was an abuse\nof discretion.14\n         V. Evidence of Regional Center and School District Services\n         Defendant asserts the trial court erred in excluding evidence regarding the free\nservices that plaintiff is entitled to receive from the regional center and school district.\nDefendant acknowledges that the trial court concluded those benefits did not qualify as\ncollateral sources admissible under section 3333.1, but claims the benefits plaintiff\n\n         14\n         We deny plaintiff’s motion for judicial notice of President Donald Trump’s\nexecutive order dated January 20, 2017, in which he announced his policy to seek the\nprompt repeal of the ACA. The document is not necessary to our decision.\n\n                                              20\n\freceives are not collateral sources at all, relying on two out-of-state cases. Defendant’s\ncontention is not persuasive.\n       As we discussed above, the collateral source rule “provides that if an injured party\nreceived some compensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the\ntortfeasor, such payment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff\nwould otherwise collect from the tortfeasor.” (Hrnjak v. Graymar, Inc. (1971) 4 Cal.3d\n725, 729; Helfend v. Southern California Rapid Transit Dist. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 1, 6, 13–\n14.) In enacting section 3333.1, the Legislature did not totally abrogate the collateral\nsource rule. The Legislature was precise in delineating which sources were to be\nincluded in this exception to the collateral source rule. Not all payments made by the\nstate or the federal government were included. (See, e.g., Brown, supra, 129 Cal.App.3d\nat p. 341 [Medi-Cal payments not covered by § 3333.1].)\n       Regional center benefits, like Medi-Cal benefits, are not paid to the disabled\ndirectly. They are paid to the providers by the Department of Developmental Services.\nThe services rendered to plaintiff will be paid for by a regional center funded under the\ncomprehensive statutory scheme designed to meet the needs of the developmentally\ndisabled. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 4500 et seq.; see discussion in Association for Retarded\nCitizens v. Department of Developmental Services (1985) 38 Cal.3d 384, 388.) Like\nMedi-Cal payments, regional center benefits do not fall into any category enumerated by\nsection 3333.1. Contrary to defendant’s contention, regional centers also have\nsubrogation rights enforceable by a lien on a client’s recovery, just as does Medi-Cal.\n(Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 4659.10, 4659.11, 4659.15.) Although the care is paid for by the\nState of California, we conclude the exception under section 3333.1 is not applicable, and\nthe general collateral source rule applies.\n       As to the availability of the public schools to address plaintiff’s needs, defendant\nwas, in fact, allowed to introduce evidence of benefits he would receive at a public\nschool. Defendant presented evidence to support its argument that plaintiff could get\n\n                                              21\n\fmany of his needs met through the public school. Plaintiff offered contrary evidence.\nWe find no error. The task of measuring such damages falls to the jury, and its resolution\nof disputed issues of probability and extent of harm will be affirmed if supported by\nsubstantial evidence. (J.P. v. Carlsbad Unified School Dist. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 323,\n341–342.)\n         VI. Remaining Issues\n         As noted above, defendant also argues that the trial court erred in allowing the\nadmission of evidence of plaintiff’s future medical expenses that was based upon billed\nrates, and in refusing its related modification to the standard jury instruction on damages\nfor future medical care. Because we have concluded that defendant is entitled to a new\ntrial on the issue of plaintiff’s future medical costs, we offer some guidance to the trial\ncourt.\n         We agree with Corenbaum that while an injured plaintiff is entitled to recover the\nreasonable value of medical services that are reasonably certain to be necessary in the\nfuture, evidence of the full amount billed for past medical services cannot support an\nexpert opinion on the reasonable value of future medical services. (Corenbaum, supra,\n215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1330–1333.) It does not appear, however, that Roughan used the\nfull amount billed for past medical services in making the calculations for her life care\nplan. We observe “the ‘requirement of certainty . . . cannot be strictly applied where\nprospective damages are sought, because probabilities are really the basis for the\naward.’ ” (Behr v. Redmond (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 517, 533.) At the time of trial, the\nprecise medical costs a plaintiff will incur in the future are not known. Nor is it known\nhow a plaintiff will necessarily pay for such expenses. It is unknown, for example, what,\nif any, insurance a plaintiff will have at any given time or what rate an insurer will have\nnegotiated with any given medical provider for a particular service at the time and\nlocation the plaintiff will require the medical care. The fact finder is entrusted with the\ntasks of evaluating the probabilities based on the evidence presented and arriving at a\n\n                                              22\n\freasonable result. If issues arise during retrial, the court is directed to address them in a\nmatter not inconsistent with this opinion.15\n        As to the requested jury modification, we observe the standard jury instruction\n(CACI No. 3903A) states, in relevant part: “To recover damages for future medical\nexpenses, [name of plaintiff] must prove the reasonable cost of reasonably necessary\nmedical care that [he/she] is reasonably certain to need in the future.” The instruction is\nan accurate statement of the law and is not, on its face, inconsistent with our decision\nhere.\n        During oral argument both sides agreed that if the case is remanded for a trial on\nfuture medical damages, the jury verdict on future lost earnings should be affirmed.\nAppellant is not disputing this portion of the jury award. Therefore, we affirm the jury\naward of future lost earnings in this case.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n        The judgment is reversed in part. The matter is remanded for a new trial on the\nissue of the amount of plaintiff’s future medical damages. Consequently, the\npostjudgment orders awarding costs and expert fees are also reversed. The jury award of\nfuture lost earnings is affirmed. The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n        15\n          We note much of the costs in plaintiff’s life care plan concerned future expenses\nthat do not appear to be covered by medical insurance. Roughan testified that once he\nemancipated at age 22, plaintiff would need to live in a supportive living environment for\nthe rest of his life due to his very low IQ level. Rather than a simple residential facility,\nshe opined that he would need to be placed in a home that employs personnel who have\nexperience caring for brain-injured individuals. Attendant care was priced at the same\namount in both parties’ life care plans, presumably because it is not covered by Medi-Cal\nor any ACA-sponsored private insurance.\n\n                                               23\n\f                                 _________________________\n                                 Dondero, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nHumes, P.

Ct. No. MSC09-01786)\n        Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n        Plaintiff Brian Cuevas, through his guardian ad litem, brought an action for\nmedical malpractice against defendant the County of Contra Costa, among others, arising\nout of injuries he sustained at birth. A jury awarded him $9,577,000 as the present cash\nvalue of his future medical and rehabilitation care expenses. Defendant appeals from the\ndamages verdict, asserting, among other things, that the trial court erred in excluding\nevidence that health insurance benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct (ACA) (Pub.L. No. 111-148 (Mar. 23, 2010) 124 Stat. 119) would be available to\nmitigate plaintiff’s future medical costs. We agree that the trial court erred in ruling that\nevidence of future ACA benefits is inadmissible. We reverse the judgment and remand\nthe case for a new trial on the amount of plaintiff’s future medical damages. In light of\nour conclusion, we also reverse the postjudgment orders awarding costs and expert fees.\n                FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nBackground\n        Because defendant does not contest the jury’s findings of liability and proximate\ncause, we need not address the facts of this case in great detail. Plaintiff suffered\n\firreversible brain damage in utero while his mother’s pregnancy was being managed by\nDr. Teresa Madrigal, a physician employed by defendant. Plaintiff is the surviving twin\nof a monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancy—a condition whereby identical twins share a\nplacenta, but have separate amniotic sacs.\n       When plaintiff’s mother reported for an appointment at 37 weeks and six days\npregnant, only one fetal heartbeat could be detected. She was transferred to a hospital by\nambulance, where the twins were delivered via caesarian section. Plaintiff’s twin had\ndied, and plaintiff had suffered a hypoxic brain injury. As a result, plaintiff has a very\nlow verbal IQ and will never be a functional reader. He also has serious language\ncommunication difficulties, significant behavioral problems, and has been diagnosed with\ncerebral palsy. Though he has severe developmental delay, he is sociable. He is toilet\ntrained and can walk, run, and feed himself. In the future, he will be able to feed, dress,\nand bathe himself. However, he will be dependent on others for his personal care and\nsafety for the rest of his life.\n       On April 19, 2010, plaintiff, through his guardian ad litem, filed a first amended\ncomplaint (FAC) against Contra Costa County Health Services and 13 other defendant\nhealth care providers and medical centers. The FAC alleges two causes of action:\n(1) medical malpractice as to plaintiff, and (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress as\nto his mother.1 Plaintiff’s theory at trial was that he sustained his injury because\nMadrigal breached the applicable standard of care by failing to schedule his delivery\nprior to 37 weeks’ gestation. The case was tried to a jury, which found in plaintiff’s\nfavor on liability. Defendant does not contest this finding on appeal.\nPlaintiff’s and Defendant’s Life Care Plans\n       During discovery, plaintiff disclosed a life care plan prepared by Jan Roughan, in\nwhich she provided her opinion as to the kind of medical and rehabilitative care he will\n\n\n       1\n           Plaintiff’s mother’s claims are not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                                 2\n\fneed for the rest of his life, along with the projected costs for each specific care item.\nHer plan was based on the recommendations of medical specialists who testified on\nplaintiff’s behalf. As to future medical costs, the plan does not account for service\ndiscounts associated with Medi-Cal, even though plaintiff is currently receiving Medi-Cal\nbenefits. Nor does it reflect negotiated discounts that would potentially be available\nunder insurance procured through the ACA. Instead, Roughan determined future costs\nfor plaintiff’s medical care by referencing a national database that reflects the average\ncharges billed for each type of service.\n       Defendant’s life care planner, Linda Olzack, prepared life care plans based on\nservices recommended by a defense pediatric neurologist. In contrast to Roughan,\nOlzack’s plans reflect three alternate cost scenarios, including one in which plaintiff\nwould continue to be covered by Medi-Cal, one in which he would procure private\ninsurance under the ACA, and one in which he would pay for his expenses out of pocket.\nWith respect to the private pay scenario, Olzack did not rely on amounts billed by\nhealthcare providers in calculating future medical expenses. Instead, she contacted local\nhealth care providers and asked them how much individuals without insurance are\nrequired to pay. These rates typically are less than what providers would state on a bill.\n       Olzack’s alternative plans reflect the wide variations that presently exist in\nmedical charging practices. Her Medi-Cal life care plan reflects reimbursement rates that\nappear to be substantially lower than the rates paid by persons without insurance. For\nexample, one category of expenses reflects a more than 60 percent difference between the\nprivate pay rate and the Medi-Cal rate. Within her plans, she also took into consideration\nthe free benefits that plaintiff is currently entitled to receive from the regional center and\npublic school system.\n       Olzack also prepared a report comparing the costs for the services itemized in\nRoughan’s plan with the Medi-Cal payment rate for the same goods and services,\nrevealing that Roughan’s costs were substantially higher. For example, the cost for a\n\n                                               3\n\fwide variety of physician visits listed in Roughan’s plan were four to six times higher\nthan the corresponding Medi-Cal rates.2\nEvidentiary Rulings\n       On January 10, 2014, plaintiff filed various motions in limine, including one\nseeking to exclude evidence of collateral source payments from Medi-Cal and other\npublic sources, and another to exclude evidence of future collateral sources. Plaintiff also\nfiled a motion to exclude evidence, opinion, or argument regarding any possible future\nmedical benefits available through ACA-mandated insurance. In part, plaintiff asserted\nthat Civil Code section 3333.1 (section 3333.1), a statute contained within the Medical\nInjury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA), does not allow the introduction of evidence\nregarding future collateral source medical benefits. He contended defendant’s expert\nshould be prohibited from offering opinions as to such evidence.\n       On July 14, 2014, defendant filed further briefing on the issue of future medical\nbenefits. In support of its argument that evidence of prospective ACA benefits should be\noffered to the jury, it included a declaration prepared by Thomas J. Dawson, an expert on\nthe ACA and regulatory and health care policy, who worked for the United States House\nof Representatives during the passage of the ACA and was directly involved in\nnegotiating key provisions of the legislation.\n       After hearing argument, the trial court ruled that defendant could not present as a\ncollateral-source offset any evidence concerning publicly funded benefits available\nthrough regional centers and the public school system. Relying on section 3333.1, it also\nruled defendant could not introduce any evidence of Medi-Cal benefits, nor could it\nintroduce evidence of ACA insurance benefits. With respect to Medi-Cal, the court ruled\nthat Medi-Cal is not subject to MICRA’s exception to the collateral source rule. With\n\n       2\n        Roughan also estimated the cost of a surgical procedure to correct plaintiff’s\nstrabismus (crossed eyes) at $14,785. Olzack’s report stated that the Medi-Cal\nreimbursement rate for this procedure would be only $4,527.\n\n                                             4\n\frespect to the ACA, the court also reasoned: “I believe that there is no reasonable\ncertainty that that benefit will be in place, and that’s something that—you have to cross\nthat barrier in order to be considered as something that should be presented to the jury for\nfactual consideration.”\n       On August 28, 2014, defendant filed a request for clarification regarding the\npresentation of evidence as to plaintiff’s future medical expenses. Specifically, it\nasserted Roughan had relied on “inflated” billed amounts in calculating the cost of\nplaintiff’s future medical care, rather than the lower amounts providers actually accept as\nfull payment. Defendant questioned whether the trial court had intended to allow the\nintroduction of such evidence when it made its earlier rulings on plaintiff’s motions in\nlimine. Defendant suggested the evidence should instead be limited to the amounts\nhealth care providers will accept in the future as full payment.\n       Defendant noted Roughan’s life care plan did not reflect the substantially lower\namounts that would be accepted as full payment under Medi-Cal or private insurance.3 It\nrelied heavily on Howell v. Hamilton Meats & Provisions, Inc. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844253\"><a href=\"/opinion/844253/howell-v-hamilton-meats-provisions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Howell) and Corenbaum v. Lampkin (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Corenbaum) in\narguing that plaintiff’s recovery should be limited to the amount he proves is likely to be\npaid to providers for his future medical care, not the amount his providers are likely to\nbill. It contended that the billed rates reflected in Roughan’s plan were therefore\ninadmissible.\n       Defendant also asked whether it would be allowed to introduce evidence\nconcerning the range of amounts healthcare providers accept as full payment, without\nmaking reference to the actual sources (i.e., Medi-Cal or private insurance) of those\npayments. Defendant asserted that introducing these reduced amounts “would assist the\n\n\n       3\n         The parties stipulated that plaintiff’s medical expenses up to the time of trial\ntotaled $55,780.\n\n                                              5\n\fjury in evaluating the reasonable value of plaintiff’s future medical care, without\nviolating the collateral source rule by disclosing the third party source of payment.” It\nreasoned “[t]he fact that Medi-Cal does not fall within the exception to the collateral\nsource rule of MICRA is completely separate from the issue of whether the County may\nintroduce evidence regarding the amounts Medi-Cal will pay for a service, without\nreferencing the source of payment. In the former scenario, the County would be seeking\nto be completely relieved from paying for a service that Medi-Cal will cover, while in the\nlatter, the County simply seeks to provide the jury with all of the information needed to\ndetermine the reasonable value of plaintiff’s future medical care.”\n       The trial court stated that it would allow evidence of Roughan’s reliance on the\nnational database to project plaintiff’s medical costs into the future “because it’s not\nrelying on past billed amounts.” The court also indicated it would permit Olzack to\ntestify that she had based her own calculations on the lower amounts that are accepted by\nhealthcare providers under certain circumstances (the private pay scenario). However,\ndefendant would not be allowed to attempt to establish that future billed amounts do not\nreflect the amounts that will actually be accepted by the providers.\n       Defendant also sought a modified version of CACI No. 3903A (with the\nmodification italicized): “To recover damages for future medical expenses, plaintiff\nBrian Cuevas must prove the reasonable cost of reasonably necessary medical care that\nhe is reasonably certain to need in the future. The damages awarded for future medical\nexpenses cannot exceed the amount that is reasonably certain to be owed or paid to\nplaintiff’s healthcare providers in the future for that care.” The trial court rejected\ndefendant’s proposed modification.\nEvidence Offered at Trial\n       Roughan’s life care plan was admitted in evidence during her testimony.\nSubsequently, Olzack was permitted to testify about her private-pay life care plan, the\nonly version of her three plans that the trial court allowed into evidence. Olzack noted\n\n                                              6\n\fthat her plan identifies the providers her office contacted to obtain her cost estimates. As\nto the specific services listed for future medical care, her task was not to make care\nrecommendations, but only to determine how much the recommended services will cost.\nUnlike Roughan, Olzack did not rely on the charged amounts that appear in national\nhealth care cost databases. Notwithstanding their different approaches, Olzack’s private-\npay plan reflects essentially the same costs as Roughan’s plan for many life care\ncategories.\n       Based on a projected remaining life expectancy of 74 years, plaintiff’s economist\ncalculated the total value of his future care expenses under Roughan’s life care plan to be\n$285 million, with a present value of nearly $29 million. In contrast, defendant’s\neconomist took the rates to which Olzack was permitted to testify and concluded that the\npresent value of plaintiff’s future service needs totaled somewhere between $3,233,670\nand $3,340,222. Defendant claims these estimates would have been significantly lower if\nOlzack had been able to factor into her analysis the free benefits plaintiff receives from\nthe regional center and the school system, as well as discounted medical care rates that\nwould apply under Medi-Cal or a private insurance policy.\nJury Instructions and Verdict\n       The jury found in favor of plaintiff and awarded $100 million for future medical,\nhospital, surgical, and rehabilitation care expenses, which it reduced to $9,577,000 in\npresent cash value. The total represents approximately one-third of what plaintiff had\nsought, and about three times the total in the private pay version of Olzack’s plan that the\ntrial court admitted into evidence. Following posttrial motions, defendant appealed from\nthe judgment and postjudgment orders awarding plaintiff costs and expert witness fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\nI.     Issues and Standard of Review\n       On appeal, defendant asserts the trial court committed four categories of error, all\npertaining to its rulings regarding evidence of the costs for plaintiff’s future care.4\nDefendant claims the court erred in (1) barring evidence under section 3333.1 of future\nbenefits that will be available to plaintiff through the ACA; (2) ruling that his future\nmedical expenses could be based upon figures derived from billed rates; (3) relying on\nthe collateral source rule to exclude evidence concerning insurance benefits available\nunder the ACA; and (4) relying on the collateral source rule to exclude evidence of free\nregional center and educational benefits.\n       Trial courts ordinarily enjoy broad discretion with respect to the admission and\nexclusion of evidence in ruling on motions in limine. (Katiuzhinsky v. Perry (2007)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1294.) Nonetheless, that discretion “is limited by the legal\nprinciples applicable to the case.” (Ibid.) Where a trial court’s exclusion or admission of\nevidence “ ‘ “ ‘transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law,’ ” ’ ” it is an\nabuse of discretion. (Ibid.) Thus, to determine whether the trial court abused its\ndiscretion here, we must first determine what the law permits and requires with respect to\nthe recovery of future medical damages under MICRA.\n\n\n       4\n         Plaintiff asserts defendant cannot show prejudice because it did not ask the jury\nto segregate the elements of his future medical damages. By constitutional mandate, we\ncannot reverse a judgment based on instructional error, evidentiary error, or procedural\nerror unless, based on “an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence,” we\nare “of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.”\n(Cal. Const., art. VI, § 13.) Under this standard, a trial court’s errors require reversal if it\nis reasonably probable that they affected the verdict. (College Hospital Inc. v. Superior\nCourt (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1296967\"><a href=\"/opinion/1296967/college-hospital-inc-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715.) “We have made clear that a ‘probability’ in this\ncontext does not mean more likely than not, but merely a reasonable chance, more than\nan abstract possibility.” (Ibid.) We conclude defendant’s claims raise more than an\n“abstract possibility” as to the effects of the alleged errors on the damages awarded, and\nelect to address its arguments on their merits.\n\n                                               8\n\fII.    The Collateral Source Rule and Section 3333.1\n       The collateral source rule provides that “ ‘if an injured party received some\ncompensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor, such\npayment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff would otherwise\ncollect from the tortfeasor.’ [Citation.] Therefore, the collateral source rule precludes a\ndefendant from presenting evidence that an injured plaintiff’s medical expenses have\nbeen paid by an independent source. [Citation.] While the rule may effectively allow a\nplaintiff to receive a double recovery, ‘ “[t]he collateral source rule expresses a policy\njudgment in favor of encouraging citizens to purchase and maintain insurance for\npersonal injuries and for other eventualities. . . . To permit the defendant to tell the jury\nthat the plaintiff has been recompensed by a collateral source for his medical costs might\nirretrievably upset the complex, delicate, and somewhat indefinable calculations which\nresult in the normal jury verdict. . . .” ’ ” (Hernandez v. California Hospital Medical\nCenter (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504–505 (Hernandez).)\n       In response to a medical malpractice insurance crisis in California, the Legislature\nin 1975 adopted MICRA. (Barme v. Wood (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1432360\"><a href=\"/opinion/1432360/barme-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 178–179 (Barme).)\nSection 3333.1 alters the collateral source rule in medical malpractice cases. A medical\nmalpractice defendant may introduce evidence of “any amount payable as a benefit to the\nplaintiff as a result of the personal injury pursuant to the United States Social Security\nAct, any state or federal income disability or worker’s compensation act, any health,\nsickness or income-disability insurance, accident insurance that provides health benefits\nor income-disability coverage, and any contract or agreement of any group, organization,\npartnership, or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of medical, hospital,\ndental, or other health care services.” (§ 3333.1, subd. (a), fn. omitted.) If the medical\nmalpractice defendant introduces evidence of the plaintiff’s collateral source benefits, the\nplaintiff may introduce evidence of any payments made to obtain these benefits. (Ibid.)\nThis section also provides that “[n]o source of collateral benefits introduced pursuant to\n\n                                              9\n\fsubdivision (a) shall recover any amount against the plaintiff nor shall it be subrogated to\nthe rights of the plaintiff against a defendant.” (§ 3333.1, subd. (b).) Under section\n3333.1, the jury is informed of collateral source benefits and may elect not to award\ndamages that duplicate those benefits. (Barme, at p. 179, fn. 5.)\n       Courts have held that section 3333.1 does not apply to payments made on behalf\nof an injured party by Medi-Cal (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 14000 et seq.).5 (Hernandez,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 506.) In Brown v. Stewart (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341\n(Brown), the appellate court concluded that applying section 3333.1 to Medicaid\npayments for medical services would create a direct conflict with provisions of federal\nlaw that require states to seek reimbursement of Medicaid payments from third party\ntortfeasors. Therefore, the collateral source rule continues to apply in medical\nmalpractice cases as to Medi-Cal payments.\nIII.   Evidence Regarding Future Benefits Is Admissible Under Section 3333.1\n       A. Section 3333.1 Is Ambiguous with Respect to Awards of Future Damages\n       The trial court ruled that section 3333.1 does not allow the introduction of\nevidence regarding future health insurance benefits—only past benefits. Defendant\nasserts that section 3333.1 allows the introduction of future as well as past collateral\nsource medical benefits, thereby allowing the jury to decide whether to reduce a\nplaintiff’s damages award for future medical expenses.\n       The issue is one of statutory interpretation. A court’s “primary task in interpreting\na statute is to determine the Legislature’s intent, giving effect to the law’s purpose.\n[Citation.] [The court] consider[s] first the words of a statute, as the most reliable\nindicator of legislative intent. [Citation.] ‘ “ ‘Words must be construed in context, and\nstatutes must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent\n\n\n       5\n        “Medi-Cal is California’s implementation of the federal Medicaid program.”\n(Howell, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 553, fn. 3.)\n\n                                             10\n\fpossible.’ ” ’ ” (Tuolumne Jobs & Small Business Alliance v. Superior Court (2014)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1037.) If, however, “ ‘the statutory language may reasonably be given\nmore than one interpretation, “ ‘ “courts may consider various extrinsic aids, including\nthe purpose of the statute, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,\nand the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.” ’ ” ’ ” (People v. Cornett (2012)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1265.)\n         Again, section 3333.1 provides, in relevant part: “In the event the defendant so\nelects . . ., he may introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff\nas a result of the personal injury pursuant to the United States Social Security Act, any\nstate or federal income disability or worker’s compensation act, any health, sickness or\nincome-disability insurance, accident insurance that provides health benefits or income-\ndisability coverage, and any contract or agreement of any group, organization,\npartnership, or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of medical, hospital,\ndental, or other health care services. Where the defendant elects to introduce such\nevidence, the plaintiff may introduce evidence of any amount which the plaintiff has paid\nor contributed to secure his right to any insurance benefits concerning which the\ndefendant has introduced evidence.” (§ 3333.1, subd. (a), italics added, fn. omitted.)\nDefendant argues that the statute’s use of the term “amount payable,” instead of “amount\npaid,” “contemplates that evidence of future benefits should be admissible as well.”6 We\nagree.\n         While the meaning of “paid” as used in subdivision (a) of this section is clear, in\nthat it references that amount which a plaintiff has already paid to obtain insurance\nbenefits, we agree with defendant that “amount payable” is ambiguous insofar as it could\napply to amounts that will be payable in the future as well as to amounts that were\n\n         6\n         Amici curiae the California Medical Association, California Dental Association,\nand California Hospital Association, on behalf of defendant, assert that the plain language\nof section 3333.1, subdivision (a), “applies to economic damages ‘payable’ in the future.”\n\n                                              11\n\fpayable in the past.7 An argument can be made that “amount payable” should be\nrestricted to past medical expenses because the statute only includes an offset for those\npremiums that a plaintiff has already “paid or contributed.” However, section 3333.1\ndoes not explicitly limit the presentation of a defendant’s evidence to past benefits.\n       Preliminarily, we observe we are not alone in entertaining the notion that section\n3333.1 permits the introduction of evidence of future collateral source benefits that a\nplaintiff is likely to receive.

Permanente Medical Group (1985)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1169484\"><a href=\"/opinion/1169484/fein-v-permanente-medical-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 165 (Fein) supports the conclusion that available medical insurance can\nbe used by the jury to reduce a medical malpractice plaintiff’s future medical damages\naward.8 (Fein, at p.165, fn. 21.) In Fein, the trial court used an anomalous procedure in\nimplementing section 3333.1. It did not permit evidence of collateral source benefits to\nbe introduced into evidence. Rather, because the amount of such benefits was not in\ndispute, the court ruled that it would simply reduce the verdict by the amount of the\nbenefits. Neither party objected. (Fein, at pp. 146, fn. 2, 165, fn. 21.) Thereafter, the\njury awarded, inter alia, $63,000 in future medical expenses, and the trial court ordered\nthe defendant to pay the first $63,000 of those expenses “not covered by medical\ninsurance provided by plaintiff’s employer, as such expenses were incurred.” (Id. at\npp. 145–146.)\n       Although this reimbursement procedure was not raised as an issue on appeal, the\nSupreme Court observed in the footnote referenced above that the plaintiff did “raise a\n\n\n       7\n        Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary defines “payable” as “that may, can, or\nmust be paid.” (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/payable, as of Apr. 27,\n2017.)\n       8\n         Plaintiff’s cites to two passages from Howell, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844253\"><a href=\"/opinion/844253/howell-v-hamilton-meats-provisions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> asserting\nthat the court’s “consistent use of the past tense in describing the operation of [section\n3333.1] leaves little doubt about the court’s view that the section does not apply to future\nbenefits.” The assertion is not persuasive as the court was clearly not intending to\naddress the proposition that plaintiff advances.\n\n                                             12\n\fminor contention . . . which is somewhat related to this matter.” (Fein, supra, 38 Cal.3d\nat p. 165, fn. 21.) The court explained: “In awarding damages applicable to plaintiff’s\nfuture medical expenses, the trial court indicated that defendant was to pay the first\n$63,000 of such expenses that were not covered by employer-provided medical\ninsurance. Plaintiff, pointing out that he may not be covered by medical insurance in the\nfuture, apparently objects to any reduction of future damages on the basis of potential\nfuture collateral source benefits. Under the terms of the trial court’s judgment, however,\ndefendant’s liability for such damages will be postponed only if plaintiff does in fact\nreceive such collateral benefits; thus, it is difficult to see how plaintiff has any cause to\ncomplain about this aspect of the award. Indeed, if anything, the trial court may have\ngiven plaintiff more than he was entitled to, since it did not reduce the jury’s $63,000\naward by the collateral source benefits plaintiff was likely to receive, but instead imposed\na continuing liability on defendant to pay up to a total of $63,000 for any noncovered\nmedical expenses that plaintiff may incur in the future as a result of the injury.\nDefendant has not objected to this portion of the judgment.” (Ibid., first italics in orig.,\nsecond italics added.)\n       Concededly, the relevant language in Fein appears to be dicta; however, in support\nof its argument, defendant also draws our attention to several federal court cases holding\nthat section 3333.1 allows the admission of evidence of future insurance benefits. In\nBrewington v. United States (C.D.Cal. July 24, 2015, No. CV 13-07672-DMG (CWx))\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

Purpose of MICRA and Public Policy\n       We recently had occasion to reflect on the significant reform created by MICRA\nlegislation. “ ‘In May 1975, the Governor—citing serious problems that had arisen\nthroughout the state as a result of a rapid increase in medical malpractice insurance\npremiums—convened the Legislature in extraordinary session to consider measures\naimed at remedying the situation. In response, the Legislature enacted . . . MICRA . . ., a\nlengthy statute which attacked the problem on several fronts.’ [Citation.] ‘In broad\noutline, the act . . . sought to curtail unwarranted insurance premium increases by\nauthorizing alternative insurance coverage programs and by establishing new procedures\nto review substantial rate increases, and . . . attempted to reduce the cost and increase the\nefficiency of medical malpractice litigation by revising a number of legal rules applicable\nto such litigation.’ ” (Chan v. Curran (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607, fn. omitted; see\nAmerican Bank & Trust Co. v.

We note “[t]he cases agree\nthat MICRA provisions should be construed liberally in order to promote the legislative\ninterest in negotiated resolution of medical malpractice disputes and to reduce\n\n\n\n       9\n         Another federal case cited to by defendant in its reply brief assumed, without\ndeciding, that section 3333.1 applies to future collateral source benefits. (S.H. v. United\nStates (E.D.Cal. Oct. 29, 2014, Civ. No 2:11-cv-01963-MCE-DAD) 2014 Dist. LEXIS\n154222.) The court noted, however, that the issue “does not appear to have a clear\nanswer.” (Id. at p. *9.)\n\n                                             14\n\fmalpractice insurance premiums.” (Preferred Risk Mutual Ins.

And, as we have seen, the Legislature could reasonably\nhave determined that the reduction of such costs would serve the public interest by\npreserving the availability of medical care throughout the state and by helping to assure\nthat patients who were injured by medical malpractice in the future would have a source\nof medical liability insurance to cover their losses.” (Fein, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 166.)\nInterpreting the statute as abrogating the collateral source rule with respect to future\nmedical benefits as well as past benefits is consistent with the legislative purpose of\nreducing malpractice insurance costs.\n       C. Legislative History\n       The legislative history of section 3333.1 also supports our conclusion, as it\nsuggests the Legislature intended to allow evidence of benefits payable both in the past\nand in the future.10\n       Assembly Bill No. 1 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess.) (Assem. Bill 1) was enacted and\ncodified as section 3333.1. All of Assem. Bill 1’s predecessor bills, including Assembly\nBill Nos. 21 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess., as introduced May 28, 1975 (Assem. Bill 21), § 2)\nand 27 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess.) as introduced June 2, 1975 (Assem. Bill 27), § 2),\nidentified the Legislature’s desire to eliminate duplicative damages, including duplicative\nfuture damages, “for the cost of medical care in actions for personal injuries against\nhealth care providers or health care institutions when such care has already been or will\n\n\n       10\n         We grant defendant’s request for judicial notice of the legislative history of\nsection 3333.1.\n\n                                             15\n\fbe provided by a collateral source.” (Sen. Bill No. 697 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as\namended May 13, 1975 (Sen. Bill 697), § 3, subd. (d), italics added; accord Assem.\nBill 21; Assem. Bill No. 22 (1975-1976 2d Ex. Sess.) as amended Aug. 4, 1975 (Assem.\nBill 22), § 3, subd. (c); Assem. Bill 27; Assem. Bill No. 1997 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as\nintroduced Apr. 21, 1975, § 2; see also Assem. Bill No. 1943 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as\nintroduced Apr. 17, 1975, § 2, containing substantially similar language.)\n       While “[p]rior unpassed bills generally have little value in showing legislative\nintent” (Medical Board v. Superior Court (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181), here the\npredecessor bills are instructive. This is because the Assembly Committee on Judiciary\nacknowledged the relationship between Assem. Bill 1 and its predecessor bills, stating\nthat Assem. Bill 1 “incorporates the concepts or language of the following assembly bills\nintroduced during the regular or special session,” referencing Assem. Bills 21 and 27.\nSince the adopted bill, Assem. Bill 1, incorporated “the concepts or language” of the\nprior bills, it is not unreasonable to conclude the legislative intent to extend the statute’s\nreach to future damages was adopted as well.11\n       And while the Legislature used the past tense in section 3333.1, subdivision (a)\nwith respect to a plaintiff’s right to offer evidence regarding the amount he or she “has\npaid or contributed” to secure a collateral source benefit, prior versions of the bills,\nincluding those that expressly provided that a defendant could introduce evidence of\nfuture care that “will be provided by a collateral source,” contained this same language\nconcerning the amount a plaintiff “has . . . paid or contributed.” (Sen. Bill 697; Assem.\nBill 22.) This suggests the Legislature did not understand the use of “paid or\ncontributed” to restrict the term “amount payable” to past collateral source benefits only.\nFurther, our interpretation is consistent with the cardinal principle of statutory\n\n\n       11\n          We disagree with plaintiff’s contention that the Legislature’s statements of\nintent should be ignored because they were omitted from Assem. Bill 1.\n\n                                              16\n\fconstruction that “ ‘we are required to give it an interpretation based upon the legislative\nintent with which it was passed.’ ” (Friends of Mammoth v.

In sum, we conclude section 3333.1 permits the introduction of\nevidence regarding future as well as past medical benefits. The trial court thus erred in\nrelying on this section to bar defendant from introducing evidence of future benefits.12\n       D. The Collateral Source Rule and Howell\n       Defendant asserts the trial court erred independent of section 3333.1 by relying on\nthe collateral source rule to exclude evidence of the ACA and the amounts that healthcare\nproviders typically accept as payment for their services. Defendant relies on Howell,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844253\"><a href=\"/opinion/844253/howell-v-hamilton-meats-provisions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> for the proposition that negotiated payment amounts and “the\nACA’s guaranteed issue and renewal requirements are highly probative because they . . .\nare ‘of substantial probative value’ in determining the reasonable value of plaintiff’s\nmedical services.”13 Defendant’s reasoning is persuasive.\n       Howell addressed whether a plaintiff could recover from a tortfeasor economic\ndamages for amounts billed by a medical provider in excess of the discounted sum the\nprovider agreed to accept as full payment for past medical services pursuant to a\npreexisting contract with the plaintiff’s health insurance carrier. Howell ultimately\nconcluded the plaintiff was limited to recovering the amount actually paid on his behalf\nbecause the billed amounts did not represent an economic loss the plaintiff incurred.\n(Howell, supra, 52 Cal.4th at pp. 548–549.)\n       The Howell court explained it was not abrogating or modifying the collateral\nsource rule, it simply found the rule inapplicable: “The rule . . . has no bearing on\n\n\n       12\n          In fairness to the trial court, it is notable that section 3333.1 was enacted in 1975\nyet it appears no reported California state appellate decision has squarely addressed the\nstatute’s application to future medical damages awards.\n       13\n        Defendant also relies on two out-of-state cases that deal with past medical\ndamages, not future medical damages, and are therefore not on point.\n\n                                              17\n\famounts that were included in a provider’s bill but for which the plaintiff never incurred\nliability because the provider, by prior agreement, accepted a lesser amount as full\npayment. Such sums are not damages the plaintiff would otherwise have collected from\nthe defendant. They are neither paid to the providers on the plaintiff’s behalf nor paid to\nthe plaintiff in indemnity of his or her expenses. Because they do not represent an\neconomic loss for the plaintiff, they are not recoverable in the first instance.” (Howell,\nsupra, 52 Cal.4th at pp. 548–549.) Howell affirmed the vitality of the evidentiary aspect\nof the collateral source rule, stating evidence that “payments were made in whole or in\npart by an insurer remains . . . generally inadmissible.” (Id. at p. 567.) The court\ndeclined to opine as to the relevance or admissibility of the full billed amount with\nrespect to noneconomic damages or future medical expenses. (Ibid.)\n       The appellate court in Corenbaum addressed issues left open in Howell, supra,\n52 Cal.4th at page 567. The court held evidence of the full amount billed for a plaintiff’s\nmedical care is not relevant to damages for future medical care or noneconomic damages,\nconcluding that the admission of such evidence was error. (Corenbaum, supra,\n215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1319, 1330–1333.) The court reasoned the trial court’s erroneous\nadmission of such evidence was prejudicial in that case because the record “clearly\ndemonstrate[d]” that the damages awards were based on the full amount billed and not on\nthe lesser amount the plaintiff’s medical providers had accepted as full payment. (Id. at\np. 1333.) The court reversed and remanded for a new trial limited to the issue of\ncompensatory damages. (Id. at pp. 1333–1334.)\n       A recent case from the Second Appellate District, Markow v. Rosner (2016)\n3 Cal.App.5th 1027 (Markow), cites to Howell and Corenbaum, explaining: “Our\nSupreme Court has endorsed a market or exchange value as the proper way to think about\nthe reasonable value of medical services. [Citation.] This applies to the calculation of\nfuture medical expenses. [Citation.] For insured plaintiffs, the reasonable market or\nexchange value of medical services will not be the amount billed by a medical provider\n\n                                             18\n\for hospital, but the ‘amount paid pursuant to the reduced rate negotiated by the plaintiff’s\ninsurance company.’ ” (Markow, at pp. 1050–1051.)\n       In Markow, the plaintiffs’ life care planning expert estimated that the amount\nbilled for the injured party’s future hospitalizations would be approximately $2 million.\nShe also testified that the amount actually paid is usually 50 to 75 percent of the total\namount billed, while noting that with respect to one particular hospitalization, the injured\nparty’s cost had been reimbursed at a much lower rate of 12.9 percent. She also testified\nthat “reimbursement rates vary and that there is no one ‘across-the-board, set\npercentage.’ ” (Markow, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 1051.) The jury awarded $1.3\nmillion for the cost of future hospitalizations, which the defendant claimed was excessive\nbecause the plaintiffs’ expert did not consider amounts actually paid for hospitalization.\n(Id. at p. 1050.) If the jury had applied the 12.9 percent rate, he argued, the award for\nfuture hospitalizations would have been reduced to $260,000. (Id. at p. 1051.) Citing the\nexpert testimony, the appellate court found substantial evidence supported the jury’s\naward of $1.3 million, which was roughly halfway between the expert’s 50 to 75 percent\nreimbursement figure. (Ibid.) These cases support the conclusion that the collateral\nsource rule is not violated when a defendant is allowed to offer evidence of the market\nvalue of future medical benefits.\n       IV. The ACA\n       In a related argument, defendant further faults the trial court for preventing it from\nintroducing evidence of future benefits that will be available to plaintiff under the ACA\nbased on its conclusion that it was speculative to assume the ACA will continue to exist.\nIt is noteworthy that this case was briefed before the 2016 presidential election, the\naftermath of which did place the ACA’s continued viability into question. However, in\nspite of recent efforts to abolish or substantially alter the ACA, as of the writing of this\nopinion the ACA remains essentially intact.\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f         Defendant’s expert Dawson’s declaration supports the proposition that plaintiff\nwill be able to acquire comprehensive health care insurance going forward. In other\nwords, it provides a defense expert assessment of the availability of insurance benefits\ncompatible with defense health care expert Olzack’s analysis of sources to finance\nplaintiff’s future need satisfaction. Dawson opined that the ACA is reasonably certain to\ncontinue well into the future and that plaintiff will be able to acquire comprehensive\nhealth insurance notwithstanding his disability. Dawson reviewed Roughan’s and\nOlzack’s life care plans and compared them both to plaintiff’s current Medi-Cal coverage\nand to insurance available on the Covered California health care exchange. Dawson\nidentified specific California insurance plans that would be available to meet many of his\nneeds. He also explained that plaintiff could use funds held in his special needs trust to\npurchase private health insurance, in which case private insurance would pay first, and\nMedi-Cal would have a right to reimbursement from the corpus of the trust only upon his\ndeath.\n         Defendant presented evidence sufficient to support the continued viability of the\nACA, as well as its application to plaintiff’s circumstances. Accordingly, we conclude\nthe trial court’s decision to exclude evidence of future insurance benefits that might be\navailable under the ACA on the basis that the ACA is unlikely to continue was an abuse\nof discretion.14\n         V. Evidence of Regional Center and School District Services\n         Defendant asserts the trial court erred in excluding evidence regarding the free\nservices that plaintiff is entitled to receive from the regional center and school district.\nDefendant acknowledges that the trial court concluded those benefits did not qualify as\ncollateral sources admissible under section 3333.1, but claims the benefits plaintiff\n\n         14\n         We deny plaintiff’s motion for judicial notice of President Donald Trump’s\nexecutive order dated January 20, 2017, in which he announced his policy to seek the\nprompt repeal of the ACA. The document is not necessary to our decision.\n\n                                              20\n\freceives are not collateral sources at all, relying on two out-of-state cases. Defendant’s\ncontention is not persuasive.\n       As we discussed above, the collateral source rule “provides that if an injured party\nreceived some compensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the\ntortfeasor, such payment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff\nwould otherwise collect from the tortfeasor.” (Hrnjak v. Graymar, Inc. (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">725</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 729; Helfend v.

In enacting section 3333.1, the Legislature did not totally abrogate the collateral\nsource rule. The Legislature was precise in delineating which sources were to be\nincluded in this exception to the collateral source rule. Not all payments made by the\nstate or the federal government were included. (See, e.g., Brown, supra, 129 Cal.App.3d\nat p. 341 [Medi-Cal payments not covered by § 3333.1].)\n       Regional center benefits, like Medi-Cal benefits, are not paid to the disabled\ndirectly. They are paid to the providers by the Department of Developmental Services.\nThe services rendered to plaintiff will be paid for by a regional center funded under the\ncomprehensive statutory scheme designed to meet the needs of the developmentally\ndisabled. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 4500 et seq.; see discussion in Association for Retarded\nCitizens v. Department of Developmental Services (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1177289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1177289/assoc-for-retarded-citizens-v-dept-of-devtl-serv/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 388.) Like\nMedi-Cal payments, regional center benefits do not fall into any category enumerated by\nsection 3333.1. Contrary to defendant’s contention, regional centers also have\nsubrogation rights enforceable by a lien on a client’s recovery, just as does Medi-Cal.\n(Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 4659.10, 4659.11, 4659.15.) Although the care is paid for by the\nState of California, we conclude the exception under section 3333.1 is not applicable, and\nthe general collateral source rule applies.\n       As to the availability of the public schools to address plaintiff’s needs, defendant\nwas, in fact, allowed to introduce evidence of benefits he would receive at a public\nschool. Defendant presented evidence to support its argument that plaintiff could get\n\n                                              21\n\fmany of his needs met through the public school. Plaintiff offered contrary evidence.\nWe find no error. The task of measuring such damages falls to the jury, and its resolution\nof disputed issues of probability and extent of harm will be affirmed if supported by\nsubstantial evidence. (J.P. v. Carlsbad Unified School Dist. (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n341–342.)\n         VI. Remaining Issues\n         As noted above, defendant also argues that the trial court erred in allowing the\nadmission of evidence of plaintiff’s future medical expenses that was based upon billed\nrates, and in refusing its related modification to the standard jury instruction on damages\nfor future medical care. Because we have concluded that defendant is entitled to a new\ntrial on the issue of plaintiff’s future medical costs, we offer some guidance to the trial\ncourt.\n         We agree with Corenbaum that while an injured plaintiff is entitled to recover the\nreasonable value of medical services that are reasonably certain to be necessary in the\nfuture, evidence of the full amount billed for past medical services cannot support an\nexpert opinion on the reasonable value of future medical services. (Corenbaum, supra,\n215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1330–1333.) It does not appear, however, that Roughan used the\nfull amount billed for past medical services in making the calculations for her life care\nplan. We observe “the ‘requirement of certainty . . . cannot be strictly applied where\nprospective damages are sought, because probabilities are really the basis for the\naward.’ ” (Behr v. Redmond (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533.) At the time of trial, the\nprecise medical costs a plaintiff will incur in the future are not known. Nor is it known\nhow a plaintiff will necessarily pay for such expenses. It is unknown, for example, what,\nif any, insurance a plaintiff will have at any given time or what rate an insurer will have\nnegotiated with any given medical provider for a particular service at the time and\nlocation the plaintiff will require the medical care. The fact finder is entrusted with the\ntasks of evaluating the probabilities based on the evidence presented and arriving at a\n\n                                              22\n\freasonable result. If issues arise during retrial, the court is directed to address them in a\nmatter not inconsistent with this opinion.15\n        As to the requested jury modification, we observe the standard jury instruction\n(CACI No. 3903A) states, in relevant part: “To recover damages for future medical\nexpenses, [name of plaintiff] must prove the reasonable cost of reasonably necessary\nmedical care that [he/she] is reasonably certain to need in the future.” The instruction is\nan accurate statement of the law and is not, on its face, inconsistent with our decision\nhere.\n        During oral argument both sides agreed that if the case is remanded for a trial on\nfuture medical damages, the jury verdict on future lost earnings should be affirmed.\nAppellant is not disputing this portion of the jury award. Therefore, we affirm the jury\naward of future lost earnings in this case.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n        The judgment is reversed in part. The matter is remanded for a new trial on the\nissue of the amount of plaintiff’s future medical damages. Consequently, the\npostjudgment orders awarding costs and expert fees are also reversed. The jury award of\nfuture lost earnings is affirmed. The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n        15\n          We note much of the costs in plaintiff’s life care plan concerned future expenses\nthat do not appear to be covered by medical insurance. Roughan testified that once he\nemancipated at age 22, plaintiff would need to live in a supportive living environment for\nthe rest of his life due to his very low IQ level. Rather than a simple residential facility,\nshe opined that he would need to be placed in a home that employs personnel who have\nexperience caring for brain-injured individuals. Attendant care was priced at the same\namount in both parties’ life care plans, presumably because it is not covered by Medi-Cal\nor any ACA-sponsored private insurance.\n\n                                               23\n\f                                 _________________________\n                                 Dondero, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nHumes, P.
