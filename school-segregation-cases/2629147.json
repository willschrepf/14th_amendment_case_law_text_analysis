We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and\n\nexercise a plenary standard of review. See Camp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d 279, 280 (3d Cir.\n\n2000). For the reasons detailed below, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n       This case is now before us for the second time. Southerland initiated the action in\n\n2010, filing a complaint raising numerous challenges to the conditions of his confinement\n\nin the Hudson County Correctional Center (HCCC). In 2012, after Southerland had twice\n\namended his complaint, the District Court dismissed the complaint sua sponte for failure\n\nto state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b)(1).\n\n       Southerland appealed, and we affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of each of\n\nSoutherland’s claims, with one exception. We ruled that the District Court had erred in\n\ndismissing Southerland’s claim that his confinement in the C-5-East segregation\n\ncellblock from June 11, 2010, to October 23, 2010, was unconstitutional. Southerland v.\n\nCnty. of Hudson, 523 F. App’x 919, 921-22 (3d Cir. 2013) (not precedential). We\n\nconcluded that, by alleging that he had been confined to his cell, which he shared with\n\nanother inmate, for up to 23 hours a day for a four-month period, Southerland — who at\n\nthe time was a pretrial detainee awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges — had\n\nstated a claim that his pretrial confinement constituted “punishment” in contravention of\n\nthe Due Process Clause. Id. at 921-22. We thus remanded to the District Court for\n\nfurther consideration of this claim.\n                                            2\n\f       Before the District Court, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the\n\nalternative, for summary judgment, arguing both that the conditions to which Southerland\n\nwas subjected did not amount to punishment and that Southerland had failed to exhaust\n\nhis administrative remedies. Southerland also moved for summary judgment, claiming\n\nthat he was entitled to judgment on the merits. The District Court construed the\n\ndefendants’ motion as seeking summary judgment and granted judgment in their favor on\n\nthe ground that Southerland had failed to exhaust his claim. Southerland then filed a\n\ntimely notice of appeal to this Court.\n\n       We agree with the District Court’s disposition of this case. As the District Court\n\nemphasized, a prisoner may not bring a lawsuit “with respect to prison conditions under\n\nsection 1983 of this title . . . until such administrative remedies as are available are\n\nexhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Section 1997e mandates “proper exhaustion”; thus, a\n\n“procedurally defective administrative grievance or appeal” does not satisfy the\n\nmandatory exhaustion requirement. Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 83-84 (2006).\n\n“[T]he determination whether a prisoner has ‘properly’ exhausted a claim . . . is made by\n\nevaluating the prisoner’s compliance with the prison’s administrative regulations\n\ngoverning inmate grievances, and the waiver, if any, of such regulations by prison\n\nofficials.” Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 222 (3d Cir. 2004). Exhaustion under § 1997e\n\nis not subject to a “futility exception.” Nyhuis v. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 71 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       Southerland objects to the District Court’s exhaustion ruling on two grounds.\n\nFirst, he argues that he filed a grievance, in accordance with the HCCC’s procedures, on\n                                               3\n\fDecember 30, 2010. However, the District Court rightly concluded that this grievance\n\nconcerned a temporary lockdown caused by some unnamed inmate’s misbehavior, rather\n\nthan the regular conditions in the C-5-East segregation cellblock. Indeed, this lockdown\n\noccurred at the end of December 2010, while in this case, Southerland complains about\n\nthe conditions from June 11, 2010, to October 23, 2010. Thus, as the District Court held,\n\nthis grievance did not give the HCCC “an opportunity to correct its own mistakes with\n\nrespect to the programs it administers before it is haled into federal court,” Woodford,\n\n548 U.S. at 89, and does not serve to exhaust Southerland’s claim.1\n\n       Second, Southerland argues that he wrote a letter to the New Jersey Office of the\n\nCorrections Ombudsman on August 8, 2010, that expressly complained about his\n\nrestrictive confinement during the relevant period. However, the HCCC’s grievance\n\nprocedure requires a grievance to be submitted to the prison’s ombudsman, who logs the\n\ngrievance and then forwards it to the appropriate unit manager for disposition. Thus,\n\nSoutherland submitted this grievance to the wrong office, and “[t]o exhaust remedies, a\n\nprisoner must file complaints and appeals in the place, and at the time, the prison’s\n\nadministrative rules require.” Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F.3d 1022, 1025 (7th Cir. 2002).\n\n\n1\n On appeal, Southerland argues that HCCC’s unit manager failed to respond to this\ngrievance, and that this failure to respond rendered the grievance procedure unavailable.\nHowever, Southerland did not raise this argument before the District Court, and we will\nnot address it for the first time on appeal. See, e.g., C.H. v. Cape Henlopen Sch. Dist.,\n606 F.3d 59, 73 (3d Cir. 2010). Moreover, we note that, under HCCC’s grievance\nprocedure, if the unit manager did not respond to his grievance within five days, the onus\nwas on Southerland to request a meeting with the unit manager.\n\n                                             4\n\fThus, we likewise agree with the District Court that Southerland did not exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies through this letter. See Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 F.3d 265,\n\n273 (3d Cir. 2013) (concluding that inmate did not exhaust remedies by sending letters\n\n“to individuals outside of prison administration”); see also Acosta v. U.S. Marshals Serv.,\n\n445 F.3d 509, 512 (1st Cir. 2006) (holding prisoner failed to exhaust claim when he sent\n\ngrievance to the improper person).2\n\n       Because Southerland failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, the District\n\nCourt did not err in granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment and denying\n\nSoutherland’s cross-motion. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). We will thus affirm\n\nthe District Court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  While it appears that the New Jersey Office of the Corrections Ombudsman forwarded\nSoutherland’s letter to the HCCC’s director, this does not help Southerland here. First,\nHCCC’s director was not the correct grievance recipient; as noted above, the grievance\nwas required to be directed first to the ombudsman and unit manager. Thus, even after\nbeing forwarded, the complaint was not filed “in the place . . . the prison’s administrative\nrules require.” Pozo, 286 F.3d at 1025. Moreover, the undisputed evidence reveals that\nthe HCCC never logged the letter as a grievance or considered it on its merits. Therefore,\nthis is not a case where the HCCC can be said to have waived compliance with its\nprocedures. Cf. Camp, 219 F.3d at 281 (concluding that exhaustion requirement was\nsatisfied when, although grievance was sent to the wrong office, the ultimate\nadministrative authority fully examined the grievance on the merits).\n                                             5\n\f",

First,\nHCCC’s director was not the correct grievance recipient; as noted above, the grievance\nwas required to be directed first to the ombudsman and unit manager. Thus, even after\nbeing forwarded, the complaint was not filed “in the place . . . the prison’s administrative\nrules require.” Pozo, 286 F.3d at 1025. Moreover, the undisputed evidence reveals that\nthe HCCC never logged the letter as a grievance or considered it on its merits. Therefore,\nthis is not a case where the HCCC can be said to have waived compliance with its\nprocedures. Cf. Camp, 219 F.3d at 281 (concluding that exhaustion requirement was\nsatisfied when, although grievance was sent to the wrong office, the ultimate\nadministrative authority fully examined the grievance on the merits).\n                                             5\n\f</pre>",
