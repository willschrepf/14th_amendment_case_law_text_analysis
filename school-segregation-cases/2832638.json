Plaintiff-appellant Jennifer Lothes was\n\nadjudicated to be a delinquent child for committing a felony burglary while still a minor. She was\n\nsentenced to not less than six months at an Ohio Department of Youth Services (“DYS”) facility for\n\njuveniles. Lothes claims she was denied admittance to a local community corrections facility\n\n(“CCF”) on the basis of her sex. Lothes brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming\n\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX of the Education\n\nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-88 (“Title IX”). For the following reasons, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to both claims.\n\n                                                I.\n\n       Lothes, while still a minor, broke into and burglarized her parents’ home. Her parents\n\npressed charges, and in May 2004, Lothes was adjudicated by the Butler County Juvenile Court to\n\fbe a delinquent child for committing the adult offense of felony burglary. Defendant Butler County\n\nJuvenile Rehabilitation Center (“BCJRC” or “the Center”) is a multi-county CCF for juvenile\n\ndelinquents organized under Ohio Rev. Code § 5139.36 and Ohio Admin. Code §§ 5139-61, 5139-63\n\nand established by an agreement between the Ohio DYS and Butler, Clermont, Clinton, and Warren\n\nCounties. The statutory purpose of a CCF such as the BCJRC is to reduce “the number of felony\n\ndelinquents committed to the department from the county or counties associated with the community\n\ncorrections facility.” Ohio Rev. Code § 5139.36(B)(1)(a). Defendant Thomas W. Barnes is the\n\nsuperintendent of the BCJRC and in charge of its operation, including the enforcement of its\n\neligibility criteria. Defendant Butler County is a signatory to the Multi-County Agreement that\n\nestablished the BCJRC. In that agreement, Butler County agreed to operate and manage the BCJRC\n\nfor the use of all member counties. Ohio’s delinquent children not confined locally in CCFs like the\n\nBCJRC are housed in DYS-operated facilities.\n\n       The BCJRC opened in 1992 and is generally considered a success.1 The BCJRC was\n\noriginally a 46-bed facility for males, consisting of three ten-bed units, one six-bed unit, and a\n\nseparate ten-bed halfway house. The BCJRC began accepting female offenders in 1996 in an effort\n\nto meet its goal of maintaining the 90 percent occupancy rate necessary to retain full funding for the\n\ninstitution. The BCJRC subsequently opened a six-bed unit (representing 13 percent of the total bed\n\nspaces) as its female unit. The operation of the six-bed female unit required at least four female\n\nyouth leaders and a primary therapist or case manager specifically for that unit; staffing represented\n\n\n       1\n       Evidence suggested that in 1999 the BCJRC was among the two highest-rated CCFs in\nOhio and that its graduates had less recidivism than youths who completed the lowest-rated\nprograms.\n\n                                                  2\n\fthe most significant expense of operating the female unit.\n\n       The BCJRC experienced a steadily decreasing number of female-offender referrals in the\n\nyears preceding the elimination of the female facility in 2003. In Fiscal Year 2002 (ending on June\n\n30, 2002), the BCJRC’s average daily population was 36 juveniles, leaving an average of 10 beds\n\nunoccupied. A total of six females, or 7 percent of the total population, were admitted to the facility\n\nin FY 2002. In that year, the Ohio DYS informed the BCJRC that its funding would be cut.2 In\n\n2002, pursuant to budget cuts resulting from its failure to maintain the required 90 percent occupancy\n\nrate, the BCJRC eliminated the ten-bed halfway house, reducing the total facility capacity to 36 beds.\n\nEven after eliminating these beds, the Center was unable to meet the 90 percent occupancy\n\nrequirement.\n\n       The Ohio DYS announced a second round of budget cuts in February 2003. The announced\n\ncut was to be 5 percent of the BCJRC’s annual budget, or roughly $77,000.3 At the time of the\n\nnotification of the imminent budget cut, the BCJRC female unit had only two of its six beds\n\noccupied, and those two females were preparing to leave. After considering the available options,\n\nthe BCJRC made a decision, with the consent of the referring juvenile courts and the Ohio DYS, to\n\nclose the BCJRC female unit, effective February 1, 2003.\n\n\n       2\n        The DYS informed the BCJRC that if the Center did not maintain 90 percent occupancy,\nthe Center’s funding would be cut in proportion to the amount that its occupancy fell short of this\nthreshold. Because the BCJRC had 46 beds at this point, the Center had to maintain an average\noccupancy of 42 juveniles to retain full funding. For every resident short of this number, the\nCenter would lose approximately $28,000 to $30,000.\n       3\n         The State’s payments to CCFs like the BCJRC were based on a quarterly schedule, and\nas a result, the entire budget cut would come out of the fourth quarter of the year and constitute\n30 percent of the funding for that quarter.\n\n                                                  3\n\f       Lothes was sentenced in May 2004, well after the BCJRC stopped accepting females.\n\nLothes was ultimately committed to the DYS for a minimum term of six months and a maximum\n\nterm not to extend beyond her twenty-first birthday. Lothes was assigned to the DYS Scioto\n\nCorrectional Facility for Juveniles (“Scioto”) for a period of six months and then transferred to the\n\nFreedom Center, a drug rehabilitation center, for a period of three months. She served approximately\n\neleven months and was released.\n\n       While at Scioto, Lothes attended school and participated in group therapy. She testified that\n\nshe benefitted from the education and counseling she received at Scioto and did not report any\n\nnegative experiences that hampered her well-being, development, or education. Lothes’s mother,\n\nSara Lopez, does not cite any specific programs or services that Lothes would have enjoyed had she\n\nbeen placed at the BCJRC instead of Scioto. Rather, Lopez asserts that a local placement (such as\n\nthe BCJRC) would have made participation in family therapy during her daughter’s incarceration\n\nmore convenient.4\n\n       Lothes contends that she was denied the services afforded to similarly situated males and this\n\ntreatment violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After\n\nfiling suit in federal district court, Lothes’s case was referred to a magistrate judge for disposition\n\n\n       4\n         Ohio state law specifically provides for out-of-county placements for juveniles to other\ncounties’ CCFs. Ohio Rev. Code § 5139.36(E)(3). Gary Neidenthal, the Superintendent of\nCorrections for Green County Juvenile Court and manager of the Miami Valley Community\nCorrections Facility (“Miami Valley”), provided in his affidavit that Miami Valley accepted\njuvenile girls during 2003 and 2004 and “was ready, willing, and able to accept referrals for\nfemale juvenile offenders from other counties, including Butler County, Ohio.” Miami Valley\noffered the same programs of counseling and treatment offered at the BCJRC. Both Lothes’s\nattorney and her sentencing judge were apparently unaware of the availability of placements at\nMiami Valley.\n\n                                                  4\n\fby consent of the parties. The magistrate judge concluded that Lothes had failed to meet her burden\n\nof showing that she had been denied educational programs or activities on the basis of her sex in\n\nviolation of Title IX. Specifically, the magistrate judge found that Lothes did not establish that\n\nfemale residents of the DYS are afforded educational and counseling opportunities unequal to those\n\nof their male counterparts who are housed in CCFs or elsewhere. With regard to Lothes’s equal\n\nprotection claim, the magistrate judge found that “because [Lothes] had available to her a\n\nrehabilitation program that was substantially equal to that offered at the Butler County Juvenile\n\nRehabilitation Center, she has failed to show disparate treatment in this case.” The magistrate judge\n\nconcluded that because Lothes failed to show disparate treatment, the court need not determine\n\nwhether the elimination of the female unit at the BCJRC was substantially related to an important\n\ngovernmental objective.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       This case involves an appeal from the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\n\ndefendants. On appeal, we apply a clearly erroneous standard of review to the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact and a de novo standard to its conclusions of law. Cmtys. for Equity v. Mich. High\n\nSch. Athletic Ass’n, 459 F.3d 676, 680 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\n                                                III.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       Lothes asserts that the BCJRC violated Title IX by adopting a policy that excludes females\n\nfrom its programs. Title IX provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o person in the United States shall,\n\non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fdiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). Lothes contends she was denied admission to, and a reasonable\n\nand equal opportunity to participate in, the BCJRC. The magistrate judge found that the BCJRC was\n\nnot in and of itself a “program or activity” within the meaning of Title IX but instead “it is one of\n\nseveral community corrections facilities within the ambit of the Department of Youth Services. For\n\npurposes of Title IX, the ‘program or activity’ is the entire system of juvenile institutions operated\n\nby the Ohio DYS.” Lothes asserts that the BCJRC is a distinct unit for purposes of the Title IX\n\nanalysis, and as such, it is “a single, covered entity that itself is prohibited from discrimination.”\n\nUnder the definition proposed by Lothes, her “educational opportunities must be compared with the\n\nopportunities for boys at the BCJRC.”\n\n       “Program or activity” is defined under Title IX as follows:\n\n       For the purposes of this chapter, the term “program or activity” and “program” mean\n       all of the operations of —\n                (1)(A) a department, agency, special purpose district, or other\n                instrumentality of a State or of a local government; or\n                (B) the entity of such State or local government that distributes such\n                assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State\n                or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the\n                case of assistance to a State or local government;\n                ...\n                any part of which is extended Federal financial assistance[.]\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1687.\n\n       Lothes offers no relevant authority supporting her narrow interpretation of “program or\n\nactivity.”5 To the contrary, we find that the language of Title IX and the logistical reality of\n\n\n       5\n      Lothes contends that the BCJRC is a “local political subdivision” that is distinct from the\nDYS. This argument is unavailing. The term “local political subdivision” is Lothes’s own,\n\n                                                  6\n\fadministering a prison system support the district court’s finding that the BCJRC is only one of\n\nmultiple community correction facilities within the overall ambit of the DYS. See Klinger v. Dep’t\n\nof Corr., 107 F.3d 609, 616 (8th Cir. 1997) (finding that Title IX requires comparison of\n\nopportunities for male and female prisoners within the entire state correctional system). We agree\n\nwith the Eighth Circuit that an individual correctional facility is not a “program or activity” within\n\nthe meaning of 20 U.S.C.§ 1687. Id. at 615. Instead, the only logical and workable application of\n\n§ 1687's definition of “program or activity” requires consideration of the opportunities afforded to\n\nmale and female prisoners within the entire system of institutions operated by a state’s federally-\n\nfunded correctional department, “taking into account the objective differences between the male and\n\nfemale prison populations and such penological and security considerations as are necessary to\n\naccommodate in this unique context.” Id. at 615-16. Accordingly, for purposes of Title IX, the\n\n“program or activity” here at issue includes the entire system of juvenile institutions operated by the\n\nOhio DYS.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       Having determined that the appropriate scope of analysis includes the entire Ohio system of\n\njuvenile institutions, we must compare the educational opportunities afforded to females and males\n\n\ndrawn from Ohio law, and does not appear in Title IX. Lothes cites only Floyd v. Waiters, 133\nF.3d 786, 791 (11th Cir. 1998), a case later vacated by the Supreme Court, for the proposition\nthat state law defines the scope of the covered entity for purposes of Title IX. In Floyd, the\nEleventh Circuit was interpreting 20 U.S.C. § 1687(1)(B), which in Floyd concerned educational\ninstitutions, while the case before this court focuses on § 1687(1)(A), which here concerns\nprisons. See Floyd, 133 F.3d at 790-91. This distinction is significant in light of the unique\ntreatment of prisons in the Title IX context. See, e.g., Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d 1220, 1228\n(9th Cir. 1994) (“Prisons are different from other institutions to which Title IX applies. Security\nis an important concern. And sex segregation is the accepted norm.”).\n\n                                                  7\n\fthroughout the DYS, including those at the CCFs. Title IX does not mandate a “[s]trict one-for-one\n\nidentity” of available opportunities but does require that men and women have an equal opportunity\n\nto participate in comparable programs. See Jeldness, 30 F.3d at 1229.\n\n       This court has never directly addressed this particular question, and we therefore consider\n\nour sister circuits’ treatment of the issue. In Jeldness, a case cited extensively by both parties, the\n\nNinth Circuit considered a class of female prisoners’ claim that the Oregon State Department of\n\nCorrections discriminated against female inmates in providing educational and vocational\n\nopportunities. Id. at 1224-30. After noting the unique challenges a state faces in administering a\n\nprison system, the Jeldness court explained what was required by Title IX in the prison context:\n\n       If an education program takes place in the prison, exclusion of women from a\n       particular class solely because women do not reside at the prison offering that class\n       is not improperly segregating “separately on the basis of sex,” but it is rather an\n       activity [sic] “separately on the basis of location.” The prohibited activity would be\n       the offering of educational programs only in the men’s prisons, without offering\n       equivalent programs in the women’s prisons. In that case, women would be “denied\n       the benefits of a program” on account of sex.\n\nId. at 1229.\n\n       In her deposition, Lothes did not identify adverse treatment of any sort while at Scioto.\n\nDuring her stay she went to school and participated in group therapy. Lothes received drug\n\ncounseling as well during her time at Scioto, and she reported that she benefitted from the\n\ncounseling. Lothes also attended a separate drug rehabilitation facility (the Freedom Center) for part\n\nof her incarceration. When asked if she was aware of any opportunities available to residents at the\n\nBCJRC that were not available to residents at the Scioto facility, the only difference Lothes could\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fidentify was that juveniles at the BCJRC were permitted to keep a journal.6\n\n        Sara Lopez, Lothes’s mother, also stated that nothing happened to Lothes while at Scioto that\n\nwas of concern to her. Lopez said there was nothing specific that would have been available to her\n\ndaughter at the BCJRC that was not available at Scioto. Instead, Lopez testified that a local\n\nplacement would have more easily enabled her family to engage in family therapy during her\n\ndaughter’s incarceration, rather than waiting until Lothes’s release. Family therapy was available\n\nat the Scioto facility, but it apparently was not feasible for Lopez to drive more than an hour to attend\n\nfamily therapy sessions. Such geographic hardships alone, however, do not violate Title IX. Cf.\n\nJeldness, 30 F.3d at 1229 (“If an education program takes place in the prison, exclusion of women\n\nfrom a particular class solely because women do not reside at the prison offering that class is not\n\nimproperly segregating ‘separately on the basis of sex,’ but it is rather an activity ‘separately on the\n\nbasis of location.’”)\n\n        Finally, Lothes contends that the BCJRC failed to “satisf[y] its Title IX burden to afford\n\nLothes a reasonable opportunity to attend the Miami Valley CCF.” This assertion—that there is\n\nsome affirmative duty on the part of the facility, here the BCJRC, to lead a juvenile defendant to the\n\ninstitution that she believes fits his or her needs—fundamentally misconstrues the purpose of Title\n\nIX. Under Title IX, women must have an equal opportunity to participate in programs of comparable\n\nquality, see Jeldness, 30 F.3d at 1229, but Lothes provides no case law to support the notion that\n\nunder Title IX it is incumbent upon a facility or a court to direct a defendant to the particular facility\n\n\n        6\n         As the magistrate judge noted, the fact that juveniles placed at the BCJRC may have had\nless recidivism than those in other CCFs (or even DYS facilities) in 1999 does not imply that\neducational programs over the entire system are unequal on the basis of sex.\n\n                                                    9\n\fthat she believes meets her needs.\n\n       For these reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the\n\nBCJRC on Lothes’s Title IX claim.\n\n                                                 IV.\n\n       Lothes also contends that the exclusion of females from the BCJRC violates the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.           Lothes’s sole contention is that a local\n\nplacement—such as the BCJRC—would have facilitated her participation in family therapy during\n\nher incarceration, as opposed to after her release. Lothes does not assert that she was wholly denied\n\nfamily therapy that was available to male inmates but, rather, that attending family therapy would\n\nhave required her family to drive a substantial distance.\n\n       Segregation of inmates by sex is unquestionably constitutional. See, e.g., Jeldness, 30 F.3d\n\nat 1228 (noting that “sex segregation [in prisons] is the accepted norm”). Moreover, Lothes was not\n\nentitled to go to the particular facility of her choice; the Equal Protection Clause ensures only that\n\nshe is afforded opportunities comparable to those of similarly situated males. Cf. Sullivan v. City\n\nof Cleveland Heights, 869 F.2d 961, 963 (6th Cir. 1989) (finding that a female plaintiff must first\n\nestablish that she was accorded treatment unequal to that of her male counterparts in order to proceed\n\nwith an equal protection claim).\n\n       Disparate treatment is an inherent initial requirement of an equal protection violation. See,\n\ne.g., Cmtys. for Equity, 459 F.3d at 695. Further, “[d]isparate treatment does not arise from any and\n\nall differences in treatment; it occurs only where the offending party ‘treats some people less\n\nfavorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.’” Id. (quoting\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fInt’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977)). Unlike the situation in\n\nCommunities for Equity, where female athletes were systematically given disadvantageous athletic\n\nschedules, Lothes was afforded opportunities comparable to those offered to male inmates. The\n\nundisputed evidence shows that she received counseling, educational opportunities, and drug\n\nrehabilitation services while at the Scioto DYS facility. Her family’s personal decision not to drive\n\nto Scioto to attend family therapy sessions cannot negate the fact that such therapy was offered.\n\nBecause Lothes has failed to establish how the services she received at Scioto were deficient in\n\ncomparison to the programs offered at the BCJRC, her equal protection claim must fail.

Plaintiff-appellant Jennifer Lothes was\n\nadjudicated to be a delinquent child for committing a felony burglary while still a minor. She was\n\nsentenced to not less than six months at an Ohio Department of Youth Services (“DYS”) facility for\n\njuveniles. Lothes claims she was denied admittance to a local community corrections facility\n\n(“CCF”) on the basis of her sex. Lothes brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming\n\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX of the Education\n\nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-88 (“Title IX”). For the following reasons, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to both claims.\n\n                                                I.\n\n       Lothes, while still a minor, broke into and burglarized her parents’ home. Her parents\n\npressed charges, and in May 2004, Lothes was adjudicated by the Butler County Juvenile Court to\n\fbe a delinquent child for committing the adult offense of felony burglary. Defendant Butler County\n\nJuvenile Rehabilitation Center (“BCJRC” or “the Center”) is a multi-county CCF for juvenile\n\ndelinquents organized under Ohio Rev. Code § 5139.36 and Ohio Admin. Code §§ 5139-61, 5139-63\n\nand established by an agreement between the Ohio DYS and Butler, Clermont, Clinton, and Warren\n\nCounties. The statutory purpose of a CCF such as the BCJRC is to reduce “the number of felony\n\ndelinquents committed to the department from the county or counties associated with the community\n\ncorrections facility.” Ohio Rev. Code § 5139.36(B)(1)(a). Defendant Thomas W. Barnes is the\n\nsuperintendent of the BCJRC and in charge of its operation, including the enforcement of its\n\neligibility criteria. Defendant Butler County is a signatory to the Multi-County Agreement that\n\nestablished the BCJRC. In that agreement, Butler County agreed to operate and manage the BCJRC\n\nfor the use of all member counties. Ohio’s delinquent children not confined locally in CCFs like the\n\nBCJRC are housed in DYS-operated facilities.\n\n       The BCJRC opened in 1992 and is generally considered a success.1 The BCJRC was\n\noriginally a 46-bed facility for males, consisting of three ten-bed units, one six-bed unit, and a\n\nseparate ten-bed halfway house. The BCJRC began accepting female offenders in 1996 in an effort\n\nto meet its goal of maintaining the 90 percent occupancy rate necessary to retain full funding for the\n\ninstitution. The BCJRC subsequently opened a six-bed unit (representing 13 percent of the total bed\n\nspaces) as its female unit. The operation of the six-bed female unit required at least four female\n\nyouth leaders and a primary therapist or case manager specifically for that unit; staffing represented\n\n\n       1\n       Evidence suggested that in 1999 the BCJRC was among the two highest-rated CCFs in\nOhio and that its graduates had less recidivism than youths who completed the lowest-rated\nprograms.\n\n                                                  2\n\fthe most significant expense of operating the female unit.\n\n       The BCJRC experienced a steadily decreasing number of female-offender referrals in the\n\nyears preceding the elimination of the female facility in 2003. In Fiscal Year 2002 (ending on June\n\n30, 2002), the BCJRC’s average daily population was 36 juveniles, leaving an average of 10 beds\n\nunoccupied. A total of six females, or 7 percent of the total population, were admitted to the facility\n\nin FY 2002. In that year, the Ohio DYS informed the BCJRC that its funding would be cut.2 In\n\n2002, pursuant to budget cuts resulting from its failure to maintain the required 90 percent occupancy\n\nrate, the BCJRC eliminated the ten-bed halfway house, reducing the total facility capacity to 36 beds.\n\nEven after eliminating these beds, the Center was unable to meet the 90 percent occupancy\n\nrequirement.\n\n       The Ohio DYS announced a second round of budget cuts in February 2003. The announced\n\ncut was to be 5 percent of the BCJRC’s annual budget, or roughly $77,000.3 At the time of the\n\nnotification of the imminent budget cut, the BCJRC female unit had only two of its six beds\n\noccupied, and those two females were preparing to leave. After considering the available options,\n\nthe BCJRC made a decision, with the consent of the referring juvenile courts and the Ohio DYS, to\n\nclose the BCJRC female unit, effective February 1, 2003.\n\n\n       2\n        The DYS informed the BCJRC that if the Center did not maintain 90 percent occupancy,\nthe Center’s funding would be cut in proportion to the amount that its occupancy fell short of this\nthreshold. Because the BCJRC had 46 beds at this point, the Center had to maintain an average\noccupancy of 42 juveniles to retain full funding. For every resident short of this number, the\nCenter would lose approximately $28,000 to $30,000.\n       3\n         The State’s payments to CCFs like the BCJRC were based on a quarterly schedule, and\nas a result, the entire budget cut would come out of the fourth quarter of the year and constitute\n30 percent of the funding for that quarter.\n\n                                                  3\n\f       Lothes was sentenced in May 2004, well after the BCJRC stopped accepting females.\n\nLothes was ultimately committed to the DYS for a minimum term of six months and a maximum\n\nterm not to extend beyond her twenty-first birthday. Lothes was assigned to the DYS Scioto\n\nCorrectional Facility for Juveniles (“Scioto”) for a period of six months and then transferred to the\n\nFreedom Center, a drug rehabilitation center, for a period of three months. She served approximately\n\neleven months and was released.\n\n       While at Scioto, Lothes attended school and participated in group therapy. She testified that\n\nshe benefitted from the education and counseling she received at Scioto and did not report any\n\nnegative experiences that hampered her well-being, development, or education. Lothes’s mother,\n\nSara Lopez, does not cite any specific programs or services that Lothes would have enjoyed had she\n\nbeen placed at the BCJRC instead of Scioto. Rather, Lopez asserts that a local placement (such as\n\nthe BCJRC) would have made participation in family therapy during her daughter’s incarceration\n\nmore convenient.4\n\n       Lothes contends that she was denied the services afforded to similarly situated males and this\n\ntreatment violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After\n\nfiling suit in federal district court, Lothes’s case was referred to a magistrate judge for disposition\n\n\n       4\n         Ohio state law specifically provides for out-of-county placements for juveniles to other\ncounties’ CCFs. Ohio Rev. Code § 5139.36(E)(3). Gary Neidenthal, the Superintendent of\nCorrections for Green County Juvenile Court and manager of the Miami Valley Community\nCorrections Facility (“Miami Valley”), provided in his affidavit that Miami Valley accepted\njuvenile girls during 2003 and 2004 and “was ready, willing, and able to accept referrals for\nfemale juvenile offenders from other counties, including Butler County, Ohio.” Miami Valley\noffered the same programs of counseling and treatment offered at the BCJRC. Both Lothes’s\nattorney and her sentencing judge were apparently unaware of the availability of placements at\nMiami Valley.\n\n                                                  4\n\fby consent of the parties. The magistrate judge concluded that Lothes had failed to meet her burden\n\nof showing that she had been denied educational programs or activities on the basis of her sex in\n\nviolation of Title IX. Specifically, the magistrate judge found that Lothes did not establish that\n\nfemale residents of the DYS are afforded educational and counseling opportunities unequal to those\n\nof their male counterparts who are housed in CCFs or elsewhere. With regard to Lothes’s equal\n\nprotection claim, the magistrate judge found that “because [Lothes] had available to her a\n\nrehabilitation program that was substantially equal to that offered at the Butler County Juvenile\n\nRehabilitation Center, she has failed to show disparate treatment in this case.” The magistrate judge\n\nconcluded that because Lothes failed to show disparate treatment, the court need not determine\n\nwhether the elimination of the female unit at the BCJRC was substantially related to an important\n\ngovernmental objective.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       This case involves an appeal from the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\n\ndefendants. On appeal, we apply a clearly erroneous standard of review to the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact and a de novo standard to its conclusions of law. Cmtys. for Equity v. Mich. High\n\nSch.

Title IX provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o person in the United States shall,\n\non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fdiscrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). Lothes contends she was denied admission to, and a reasonable\n\nand equal opportunity to participate in, the BCJRC. The magistrate judge found that the BCJRC was\n\nnot in and of itself a “program or activity” within the meaning of Title IX but instead “it is one of\n\nseveral community corrections facilities within the ambit of the Department of Youth Services. For\n\npurposes of Title IX, the ‘program or activity’ is the entire system of juvenile institutions operated\n\nby the Ohio DYS.” Lothes asserts that the BCJRC is a distinct unit for purposes of the Title IX\n\nanalysis, and as such, it is “a single, covered entity that itself is prohibited from discrimination.”\n\nUnder the definition proposed by Lothes, her “educational opportunities must be compared with the\n\nopportunities for boys at the BCJRC.”\n\n       “Program or activity” is defined under Title IX as follows:\n\n       For the purposes of this chapter, the term “program or activity” and “program” mean\n       all of the operations of —\n                (1)(A) a department, agency, special purpose district, or other\n                instrumentality of a State or of a local government; or\n                (B) the entity of such State or local government that distributes such\n                assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State\n                or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the\n                case of assistance to a State or local government;\n                ...\n                any part of which is extended Federal financial assistance[.]\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1687.\n\n       Lothes offers no relevant authority supporting her narrow interpretation of “program or\n\nactivity.”5 To the contrary, we find that the language of Title IX and the logistical reality of\n\n\n       5\n      Lothes contends that the BCJRC is a “local political subdivision” that is distinct from the\nDYS. This argument is unavailing. The term “local political subdivision” is Lothes’s own,\n\n                                                  6\n\fadministering a prison system support the district court’s finding that the BCJRC is only one of\n\nmultiple community correction facilities within the overall ambit of the DYS.

We agree\n\nwith the Eighth Circuit that an individual correctional facility is not a “program or activity” within\n\nthe meaning of 20 U.S.C.§ 1687. Id. at 615. Instead, the only logical and workable application of\n\n§ 1687's definition of “program or activity” requires consideration of the opportunities afforded to\n\nmale and female prisoners within the entire system of institutions operated by a state’s federally-\n\nfunded correctional department, “taking into account the objective differences between the male and\n\nfemale prison populations and such penological and security considerations as are necessary to\n\naccommodate in this unique context.” Id. at 615-16. Accordingly, for purposes of Title IX, the\n\n“program or activity” here at issue includes the entire system of juvenile institutions operated by the\n\nOhio DYS.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       Having determined that the appropriate scope of analysis includes the entire Ohio system of\n\njuvenile institutions, we must compare the educational opportunities afforded to females and males\n\n\ndrawn from Ohio law, and does not appear in Title IX.

Waiters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72573\"><a href=\"/opinion/72573/floyd-v-waiters/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 791 (11th Cir. 1998), a case later vacated by the Supreme Court, for the proposition\nthat state law defines the scope of the covered entity for purposes of Title IX. In Floyd, the\nEleventh Circuit was interpreting 20 U.S.C. § 1687(1)(B), which in Floyd concerned educational\ninstitutions, while the case before this court focuses on § 1687(1)(A), which here concerns\nprisons. See Floyd, 133 F.3d at 790-91. This distinction is significant in light of the unique\ntreatment of prisons in the Title IX context. See, e.g., Jeldness v. Pearce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675225\"><a href=\"/opinion/675225/heidi-sargent-jeldness-jenny-costa-helen-jodi-bedell-gretchen-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1228\n(9th Cir. 1994) (“Prisons are different from other institutions to which Title IX applies. Security\nis an important concern. And sex segregation is the accepted norm.”).\n\n                                                  7\n\fthroughout the DYS, including those at the CCFs. Title IX does not mandate a “[s]trict one-for-one\n\nidentity” of available opportunities but does require that men and women have an equal opportunity\n\nto participate in comparable programs. See Jeldness, 30 F.3d at 1229.\n\n       This court has never directly addressed this particular question, and we therefore consider\n\nour sister circuits’ treatment of the issue. In Jeldness, a case cited extensively by both parties, the\n\nNinth Circuit considered a class of female prisoners’ claim that the Oregon State Department of\n\nCorrections discriminated against female inmates in providing educational and vocational\n\nopportunities. Id. at 1224-30. After noting the unique challenges a state faces in administering a\n\nprison system, the Jeldness court explained what was required by Title IX in the prison context:\n\n       If an education program takes place in the prison, exclusion of women from a\n       particular class solely because women do not reside at the prison offering that class\n       is not improperly segregating “separately on the basis of sex,” but it is rather an\n       activity [sic] “separately on the basis of location.” The prohibited activity would be\n       the offering of educational programs only in the men’s prisons, without offering\n       equivalent programs in the women’s prisons. In that case, women would be “denied\n       the benefits of a program” on account of sex.\n\nId. at 1229.\n\n       In her deposition, Lothes did not identify adverse treatment of any sort while at Scioto.\n\nDuring her stay she went to school and participated in group therapy. Lothes received drug\n\ncounseling as well during her time at Scioto, and she reported that she benefitted from the\n\ncounseling. Lothes also attended a separate drug rehabilitation facility (the Freedom Center) for part\n\nof her incarceration. When asked if she was aware of any opportunities available to residents at the\n\nBCJRC that were not available to residents at the Scioto facility, the only difference Lothes could\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fidentify was that juveniles at the BCJRC were permitted to keep a journal.6\n\n        Sara Lopez, Lothes’s mother, also stated that nothing happened to Lothes while at Scioto that\n\nwas of concern to her. Lopez said there was nothing specific that would have been available to her\n\ndaughter at the BCJRC that was not available at Scioto. Instead, Lopez testified that a local\n\nplacement would have more easily enabled her family to engage in family therapy during her\n\ndaughter’s incarceration, rather than waiting until Lothes’s release. Family therapy was available\n\nat the Scioto facility, but it apparently was not feasible for Lopez to drive more than an hour to attend\n\nfamily therapy sessions. Such geographic hardships alone, however, do not violate Title IX. Cf.\n\nJeldness, 30 F.3d at 1229 (“If an education program takes place in the prison, exclusion of women\n\nfrom a particular class solely because women do not reside at the prison offering that class is not\n\nimproperly segregating ‘separately on the basis of sex,’ but it is rather an activity ‘separately on the\n\nbasis of location.’”)\n\n        Finally, Lothes contends that the BCJRC failed to “satisf[y] its Title IX burden to afford\n\nLothes a reasonable opportunity to attend the Miami Valley CCF.” This assertion—that there is\n\nsome affirmative duty on the part of the facility, here the BCJRC, to lead a juvenile defendant to the\n\ninstitution that she believes fits his or her needs—fundamentally misconstrues the purpose of Title\n\nIX. Under Title IX, women must have an equal opportunity to participate in programs of comparable\n\nquality, see Jeldness, 30 F.3d at 1229, but Lothes provides no case law to support the notion that\n\nunder Title IX it is incumbent upon a facility or a court to direct a defendant to the particular facility\n\n\n        6\n         As the magistrate judge noted, the fact that juveniles placed at the BCJRC may have had\nless recidivism than those in other CCFs (or even DYS facilities) in 1999 does not imply that\neducational programs over the entire system are unequal on the basis of sex.\n\n                                                    9\n\fthat she believes meets her needs.\n\n       For these reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the\n\nBCJRC on Lothes’s Title IX claim.\n\n                                                 IV.\n\n       Lothes also contends that the exclusion of females from the BCJRC violates the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.           Lothes’s sole contention is that a local\n\nplacement—such as the BCJRC—would have facilitated her participation in family therapy during\n\nher incarceration, as opposed to after her release. Lothes does not assert that she was wholly denied\n\nfamily therapy that was available to male inmates but, rather, that attending family therapy would\n\nhave required her family to drive a substantial distance.\n\n       Segregation of inmates by sex is unquestionably constitutional. See, e.g., Jeldness, 30 F.3d\n\nat 1228 (noting that “sex segregation [in prisons] is the accepted norm”). Moreover, Lothes was not\n\nentitled to go to the particular facility of her choice; the Equal Protection Clause ensures only that\n\nshe is afforded opportunities comparable to those of similarly situated males.

City\n\nof Cleveland Heights, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519541\"><a href=\"/opinion/519541/kate-sullivan-v-city-of-cleveland-heights-cleveland-heights-hockey-team/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 963 (6th Cir. 1989) (finding that a female plaintiff must first\n\nestablish that she was accorded treatment unequal to that of her male counterparts in order to proceed\n\nwith an equal protection claim).\n\n       Disparate treatment is an inherent initial requirement of an equal protection violation. See,\n\ne.g., Cmtys. for Equity, 459 F.3d at 695. Further, “[d]isparate treatment does not arise from any and\n\nall differences in treatment; it occurs only where the offending party ‘treats some people less\n\nfavorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.’” Id.

Unlike the situation in\n\nCommunities for Equity, where female athletes were systematically given disadvantageous athletic\n\nschedules, Lothes was afforded opportunities comparable to those offered to male inmates.
