L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-66 (Apr. 26, 1996), that require termination of prospective relief in prison conditions cases. This is not the first occasion we have had to address the constitutionality of these provisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> nor are we the first circuit to be presented with this question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although we follow our sister circuits in holding the termination provisions constitutional, we do so on grounds that are at once less sweeping a deviation from prior case law on the equitable discretion of courts in prison conditions litigation, and closer, we believe, to the text of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Hands-Off Doctrine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to understand how the PLRA operates, a sense of the context from which it emerged is helpful. Litigation over prison conditions is a relatively recentaddition to the landscape of federal jurisdiction. As one commentator has observed, \"The Constitution did not breach prison walls for over 170 years. Indeed, during most of the history of this country, there was some question as to whether prisoners had any constitutional rights at all.\" Michael Mushlin, RIGHTS OF PRISONERS S 1.02, at 7 (2d ed. 1993). According to a now renowned formulation, prisoners were mere \"slaves of the state.\" Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. (21 Gratt) 790, 796 (1871)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although asked to intervene on behalf of prisoners, federal courts systematically declined under the so-called \"hands-off doctrine,\" a rule of judicial quiescence derived from federalism and separation of powers concerns. As our court once held, \"it is well settled that it is not the function of the courts to superintend the treatment and discipline of prisoners in penitentiaries, but only to deliver from imprisonment those who are illegally confined.\" Stroud v. Swope , 187 F.2d 850, 851-52 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 829 (1951); accord Sarshik v. Sanford, 142 F.2d 676 (5th Cir. 1944); Kelly v. Dowd, 140 F.2d 81, 82 (7th Cir. 1944). And as the Supreme Court summed up the doctrine:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditionally, federal courts have adopted a broad hands-off attitude toward problems of prison administration. In part this policy is the product of various limitations on the scope of federal review of conditions in the state penal institutions. More fundamentally, this attitude springs from complementary perceptions about the nature of the problems and the efficacy of judicial intervention. Prison administrators are responsible for maintaining internal order and discipline, for securing their institutions against unauthorized access or escape, and for rehabilitating, to the extent that human nature and inadequate resources allow, the inmates placed in their custody. The Herculean obstacles to effective discharge of these duties are too apparent to warrant explication. Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree. Most require expertise, comprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative branches of government . . . . Moreover, where state penal institutions are involved, federal courts have a further reason for deference to the appropriate prison authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404-05 (1974), overruled in part, Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 413-14 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in landmark cases in the 1960's and 1970's the Supreme Court changed course, affirming the basic proposition that \"[t]here is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons of this country,\" Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-56 (1974), and ratifying the availability of 42 U.S.C. S 1983 as a vehicle for vindicating prisoners' constitutional rights. See Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546 (1964) (reversing dismissal of S 1983 claim challenging discrimination on the basis of prisoner's religious beliefs). The concept of judicial restraint was not jettisoned, just relaxed enough to permit courts to intervene in the event that prison administrators abridge fundamental constitutional rights. As the Court observed in Procunier v. Martinez, \"a policy of judicial restraint cannot encompass any failure to take cognizance of valid constitutional claims whether arising in a federal or state institution. When aprison regulation or practice offends a fundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will discharge their duty to protect constitutional rights. \" 416 U.S. at 405-06 (citing Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 486 (1969))<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the litigation which gave rise to and followed these pronouncements on prisoners' rights,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[c]lass-action suits by prisoners . . . led the courts to the definition and enforcement of minimum standards of health care, to the establishment of minimum procedural due-process requirements for the imposition of disciplinary punishments, to the equal protection of the laws for different categories of inmates, and to the upholding of the Eighth Amendment guarantee against cruel and unusual punishments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Norval Morris, The Contemporary Prison: 1865-Present, in THE OXFORD HISTORY OF THE PRISON 245 (Norval Morris &amp; David J.

And prison conditions undoubtedly have improved as a result<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Gilmore</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gilmore case is among the first generation of prison conditions cases in which the Supreme Court recognized and enforced minimum constitutional guarantees in the prison setting. The case began as a consolidation of numerous actions filed by prisoners in facilities administered by the California Department of Corrections (\"CDC\"). See Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F. Supp. 105, n.* (N.D. Cal. 1970) (citing 25consolidated cases), on remand from, Gilmore v. Lynch, 400 F.2d 228, 231 (9th Cir. 1968) (reversing district court's determination that case did not present substantial question of constitutional law requiring consideration by three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. S 2281). Collectively, the prisoners challenged regulations of the CDC restricting access to law books, legal materials, and lay assistance in preparing filings. Against the state attorney general's assertion that \"the provision of law books in prison libraries is a matter of governmental grace, i.e., a privilege to be withheld or conditioned as the State chooses,\" plaintiffs claimed that the regulations \"den[ied] indigent prisoners, and their jailhouse lawyers, the legal expertise which is necessary if access to the courts by these persons is to be in any way meaningful.\" Gilmore, 319 F. Supp. at 108.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Observing that the due process right of reasonable access to the courts \"encompasses all the means a defendant or petitioner might require to get a fair hearing from the judiciary on all charges brought against him or grievances alleged by him,\" the court found that the CDC regulations \"offer meager fare to a criminal lawyer.\" Id. at 110. As the court elaborated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no annotated codes, no United States Reports, no Federal Reports, no California Reports. There are unannotated versions of four of California's codes, but there is no copy of any part of the United States Code. There are copies of the rules of [sic] California and certain federal courts, but there is no edition of the Rules of the Federal District Courts which receive a great many of the habeas corpus petitions, and all of the civil rights petitions, filed by California prisoners. There is one copy of Witkin's treatise on California criminal procedure, but there are no other law books or journals . . . on the list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.; see also id. at 107 n.2 (noting that the regulation ordered \"all existing law books and references in inmate law libraries not consistent with [the exclusive list] removed and destroyed\"). The court flatly rejected the state's argument that a prisoner need only \"file a brief statement of the facts of his case\" in order to effectively obtain access to the courts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wording of the statute and the wishes of scholars notwithstanding, this Court takes notice that more than simple \"facts\" are needed in order to file an adequate petition for relief by way of habeas corpus. A prisoner should know the rules concerning venue, jurisdiction, exhaustion of remedies, and proper parties respondent. He should know which facts are legally significant, and merit presentation to the Court, and which are irrelevant or confusing. When the Return is filed, it is never without abundant citations to legal authority, and a proper traverse must take cognizance of these points. No attorney filing a habeas petition omits a statement of points and authorities, and neither does the State's attorney in responding to one. . . . Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483 (1969), makes it clear that some provision must be made to ensure that prisoners have the assistance necessary to file petitions and complaints which will in fact be fully considered by the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 110; see also id. at 109 (citing cases recognizing equal protection right of indigent and uneducated prisoners \"to the tools necessary to receive adequate hearing in the courts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found the restrictive list of prison library books constitutionally deficient, the court observed that the alternatives open to the state to protect prisoners' right of access \"are legion.\" Id. at 110 (noting that state could authorize public defenders to assist in collateral proceedings or initiate a legal aid program with law students and professors). The court also carefully noted that its broad equitable discretion to shape an appropriate remedy was counterbalanced by the requirement of deference to prison administrators. Id. at 112 (\"[J]udges have always feared to rush in where correctional officials are presumed more fit to tread.\").Thus the court enjoined the enforcement of the regulation implementing the restrictive list of books, but it declined to undertake the task of devising another system whereby indigent prisoners are given adequate means of obtaining the legal expertise necessary to obtain judicial consideration of alleged grievances cognizable by the courts. The Department of Corrections will, therefore, decide whether to expand the present list of basic codes and references in the manner suggested by this opinion, or whether to adopt some new method of satisfying the legal needs of its charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court affirmed in a summary opinion, see Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15 (1971) (citing Johnson v. Avery), and on remand, the state elected to supplement its prison libraries rather than develop a new scheme for ensuring access to the courts. The CDC promulgated and filed with the court proposed regulations offering a more comprehensive list of materials. On October 16, 1972, after hearing plaintiffs' objections, the court approved the proposed regulations and ordered their adoption. Gilmore v. Lynch, No. 45878, Order Directing Adoption of Regulations to Implement Previous Order Granting Relief, at 2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 16, 1972) (the \"1972 Order\") (finding that \"Plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that the proposed regulations are so inadequate that their approval would result in a continued denial to prisoners of their constitutional right to access to the courts\"). The order closed by noting that, once defendants certified that the regulations were implemented, the court would \"entertain a motion to enter a final order in this matter as a three-judge District Court, leaving determination of other issues in the case for a single judge.\" Id. at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four years later the state filed a memorandum of compliance with the 1972 Order. Defs' Mem. of Compliance with Oct. 13, 1976 Order (filed Sept. 7, 1976). Conceding that \"[p]rior to the court order, there was virtually no law material in most libraries [and that what] was on hand was usually old, dated and of little value,\" the memorandum detailed extensive modifications in the libraries' collections, circulation practices and rules for inmate access. Id. at 3. In 1977, frustrated with plaintiffs' failure to prosecute the remaining individual causes of action, the district court denied plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint and ordered plaintiffs' counsel to \"prepare a final judgment encompassing the complete results of this action . . . .\" Order Granting Defs' Mtn. to Dismiss (August 25, 1977). On September 28, 1979, following negotiations regarding attorney's fees, the district court ordered defendants to pay plaintiffs' counsel a sum certain and stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action shall be dismissed. Upon satisfactory payment of said fee, judgment shall be entered, subject to the right of plaintiffs to file a petition with this Court to seek enforcement with the provision of this Court's order of October 16, 1972.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Order Settling and Dismissing Action (Sept. 28, 1979).

In July 1997, however, the Deputy Director of the Institutions Division of the CDC circulated a memorandum to the library staff ordering them to \"delay the processing of orders for updating the current collection,\" and to process \"only those orders for lawbooks on the attached list.\" The memo added that, in view of Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343 (1996), the CDC planned to change existing regulations regarding the law libraries and to create \"a new law library collection which will be different and smaller than the current collection.\" The list attached to the memo deviated sharply from the list of books required to be kept current under the 1972 Order. Most prominently, the list provided for no annotated state or federal codes and no case reporters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days after the memo, defendants filed a motion to terminate \"the 1972 Order and other supplemental orders entered in this action\" pursuant to the termination provisions of the PLRA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court upheld the constitutionality of the Act, declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing on current conditions in the libraries and terminated the 1972 Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a case in which the substantive constitutional violation was fully adjudicated, and the remedy chosen and implemented by the CDC without protest or post-judgment supervision/modification, Gilmore differs markedly from Thompson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Thompson</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson is one of the lingering second and third generation prison conditions cases which appear to have occupied Congress' attention in drafting the termination provisions of the PLRA. In the later cases, prison administrators generally elected to enter consent decrees rather than litigate the alleged constitutional violations. See supra, notes 2 and 3 (citing cases involving comprehensive consent decrees). In these negotiated decrees, prison administrators frequently agreed to wide-ranging changes in prison practices that exceeded the constitutional minimum. Moreover, since courts are bound to enforce the terms of the decrees (indeed, this is the key distinction between a private settlement and a consent judgment), courts have often exercised continuing supervision over prisons subject to the decrees. The courts' supervision has been especially \"hands-on\" -e.g., appointing special masters, imposing sanctions for contempt, and modifying or expanding the relief provided by the decrees -where prison administrators have failed to effectuate the terms of the decrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson is a quintessential continuing supervision case. It began as a class action in 1979 by condemned inmates at San Quentin State Prison. Plaintiffs claimed that automatic confinement to administrative segregation constituted cruel and unusual punishment, violated their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion, and abridged each prisoner's right to an individualized assessment of his or her security risk. (By CDC regulation, prisoners in the general population could only be confined to administrative segregation for violating prison rules or posing an inherent threat to institutional security.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year later, the parties entered, and the court approved, a comprehensive consent decree. Thompson v. Enomoto, No. 79-1630-SAW, Consent Decree (Oct. 23, 1980). The decree covered a wide range of issues including procedures for classifying death row inmates according to their security risk, procedures for changing an inmate's classification, out-of-cell activities and schedules, and access to legal materials<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>.  Anticipating a quick transition to full compliance, the court reserved its jurisdiction for one year, adding that \"[a]t the end of one year from the date of this decree, by which time the terms of this decree shall have been implemented, this section shall be dismissed in its entirety.\" Id. at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to population increases in the North Segregation Unit, where all the condemned inmates had been housed, some inmates had to be relocated to areas where the prison was unable to provide the full range of privileges granted by the decree. Thus in 1982, the court granted a six month extension of jurisdiction to give prison administrators time to come into compliance. When the prison failed to meet the timetable, plaintiffs moved for a contempt order which the district court denied on the grounds that defendants had been reasonably diligent and the unforeseen circumstance of increased population caused the problem. See Thompson v. Enomoto , 542 F. Supp. 768, 769-70 (N.D. Cal. 1982). Instead, the court ordered modification of the decree, and directed the parties to negotiate a proposal. Id. at 770<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the parties' negotiations foundered, plaintiffs moved the court to appoint a special master pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court granted plaintiffs' motion and, in 1985, appointed a \"Monitor \" along with an order of reference conferring broad discovery powers and indicating that, absent an objection or clear error, the Monitor's reports would be accepted as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the court. On appeal, we held that the consent decree implicitly contemplated the appointment of a special master because the court retained authority to establish procedures for ensuring compliance with the decree. See Thompson v. Enomoto, 815 F.2d 1323, 1327 (9th Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next decade, the Monitor filed six reports, several of which found prison conditions in violation of the decree. The consent decree itself was modified on two occasions (once to give prisoners access to free weights and electronic typewriters in exchange for greater latitude in restraining prisoners outside death row, and once to expand law library access, incorporate noise protections and restrict Grade B prisoner privileges). See Thompson v. Enomoto , 915 F.2d 1383, 1386-90 (9th Cir. 1990) (describing First through Fourth Monitor's reports and upholding district court's decision approving modifications and refusing to vacate decree). In the Sixth Report, a one hundred page document, the Monitor found that prison officials were violating a number of decree provisions, most prominently: (1) housing noncondemned administrative segregation inmates along with Grade A condemned prisoners (a practice that caused violence and disciplinary problems), (2) the use of \"strip-cells\" as a disciplinary measure (i.e., confining inmates to cells containing only a \"strong-blanket\" in nothing but their undershorts); and (3) seriously inadequate access to legal materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court adopted the Sixth Report and denied another request by defendants to modify the decree, defendants moved to terminate the decree under the PLRA. The court granted the motion over plaintiffs' objections on constitutional grounds. See Thompson v. Gomez, 993 F. Supp. 749 (N.D.

First, they argue that the termination provisions violate separation of powers because the provisions (a) reopen and mandate the termination of final judgments, see Plaut v. Spendthrift Farms, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995), and (b) prescribe a rule of decision for the courts. See United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1871). Second, plaintiffs contend that the termination provisions violate their vested due process rights by terminating relief provided by contract and court order. Third, plaintiffs claim that the termination provisions deny prisoners equal protection of the laws by singling out prisoners and burdening their right of access to the courts. Finally, plaintiffs argue that the district courts erred by refusing to grant evidentiary hearings to determine whether there is any current and ongoing violation of federal rights in the prisons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Termination Provisions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of these claims requires a careful analysis of the termination provisions. In undertaking this analysis, we are especially mindful of the guiding principle that \"where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.\" United States ex. rel. Attorney General v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909), quoted and followed in, Jones v. United States, 120 S.

The Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64 (1804), and has for so long been applied by this Court that it is beyond debate . . . . This approach not only reflects the prudential concern that constitutional issues not be needlessly confronted, but also recognizes that Congress, like this Court, is bound by and swears an oath to uphold the Constitution. The courts will therefore not lightly assume that Congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeBartolo Corp. v.

Section 3626(a)(1) of Title 18 provides that prospective relief \"shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\" 18 U.S.C. S 3626(a)(1). Thus a district court faced with a prison conditions suit may not grant or approve prospective relief \"unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\" Id. The provision closes by requiring courts to \"give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief,\" id., and by limiting courts' power to grant preliminary injunctive relief, 18 U.S.C. S 3626(a)(2), or to release prisoners as a sanction for failure to comply with other relief. 18 U.S.C. S 3626(a)(3)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>.Section 3626(a) therefore operates simultaneously to restrict the equity jurisdiction of federal courts and to protect the bargaining power of prison administrators -no longer may courts grant or approve relief that binds prison administrators to do more than the constitutional minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If prospective relief has already been granted by a court, S 3626(b) controls.

S 3626(g)(9). \"Consent decree\" is also a defined term in the statute. It means \"any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlements.\" 18 U.S.C. S 3626(g)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Separation of Powers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two things are immediately apparent from the plain language of S 3626(b) and its defined terms for separation of power purposes. First, S 3626(b)(2) mandates only the termination of prospective relief, it does notrequire a court to terminate or vacate the underlying final judgment (typically a consent decree) which provides for such relief. Second, reading S 3626(b)(2) along with the limiting provision in S 3626(b)(3), any relief that was narrowly tailored in the first instance, and extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, is not terminable. A district court is bound to maintain or modify any form of relief necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of a federal right, so long as that relief is limited to enforcing the constitutional minimum. In short, final judgments are not undone and all of the courts' traditional equitable powers not expressly revoked are retained. So construed, the termination provisions do not impinge on the separation of powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Terminating Final Judgments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of the courts to rule on the termination provisions have concluded that the statute requires nothing less than the termination of consent decrees, and have then proceeded to asddress the grave constitutional question whether Congress can command the courts retroactively to terminate a final judgment. See Dougan, 129 F.3d at 1425-26 (\"Section 3626(b)(2) requires a court to terminate \"prospective relief,\" which includes existing consent decrees. . . . The consent decrees that the PLRA requires courts to review under the statute's more stringent standards are not final judgments for separation-of-powers purposes.\"); Rouse, 129 F.3d at 654-55 (\"[O]nce defendants or intervenors show their entitlement to terminate prospective relief, the Act seemingly requires termination of the consent decree itself. . . . We are therefore duty bound to interpret the PLRA as mandating the termination of extant consent decrees altogether . . . .\"); Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1084, 1087 (\" `Prospective relief' is defined broadly to include all relief other than compensatory damages; it expressly includes consent decrees. . . . In a continuing case, a consent decree is not the `last word' of the courts in the case, even after the decree has become final for purposes of appeal. Rather a consent decree is an executory form of relief that remains subject to later developments.\"); Plyler, 100 F.3d at 369, 371 (same); see also Imprisoned Citizens , 169 F.3d at 182 (section 3626(b)(2) requires a court to \"terminate jurisdiction\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the statute does define \"relief\" to include \"consent decrees,\" it defines \"consent decree\" narrowly. Our sister circuits have not attended to this narrow definition in their construction of the termination provisions. See id. In its ordinary usage, a consent decree is both a contract of settlement and a final judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus, although it provides for injunctiverelief according to terms agreed to by the parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> a consent decree is not merely a form of relief. The PLRA, however, defines a \"consent decree\" exclusively in terms of the relief it provides; specifically, the statute states that \" `consent decree' means any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlement agreements.\" 18 U.S.C. S 3626(g)(1) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are bound to give effect to this explicit statutory definition even though it deviates from common usage. See Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 484-85 (1987); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Lenroot, 323 U.S. 490, 502 (1945). Reading the statute as such, the termination provisions do not require the termination of consent decrees or any other final judgments of Article III courts. The provisions apply exclusively to prospective relief, limiting the scope of federal jurisdiction to enforce the prospective aspect of final judgments in prison conditions cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this saving construction, the separation of powers question is relatively straight forward namely, whether Congress may set a new and retroactively applicable standard for obtaining relief from final judgments which impose forward-looking injunctive remedies. This, Congress certainly may do. Although Plaut stands for the proposition that Congress may not enact \"retroactive legislation requiring an Article III court to setaside a final judgment,\" 514 U.S. at 240, that case involved a legislative attempt to reopen the dismissal of suits for money damages under federal securities laws, and the Court was very careful to distinguish legislation that merely \"alter[s] the prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts.\" Id. at 232 (citing Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 421 (1856) (\"Wheeling Bridge II\"), and noting that \"nothing in our holding today calls [Wheeling Bridge II] into question\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative action at issue in Wheeling Bridge II is not directly analogous to the PLRA, but the case nicely demonstrates the applicable rule. In Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., 54 U.S. (13 How.) 518 (1852) (\"Wheeling Bridge I\"), the Supreme Court held that a bridge across the Ohio River was an obstruction of navigation and ordered the bridge raised or removed. Congress responded by enacting legislation establishing the bridge as a post road for U.S. mail service and declaring that the bridge company was authorized to maintain the bridge at its existing height. Nature intervened and the bridge was destroyed by a storm. When the state of Pennsylvania sued to enjoin reconstruction of the bridge, it challenged the post road statute as an unconstitutional attempt to annul the Court's decision in Wheeling Bridge I. The bridge company prevailed on the theory that the statute merely changed the law underlying the permanent injunction granted in Wheeling Bridge I:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, we agree, if the remedy in this case had been an action at law, and a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff for damages, the right to these would have passed beyond the reach of the power of congress. It would have depended, not upon the public right of the free navigation of the river, but upon the judgment of the court. The decree before us, so far as it respect[s] the costs adjudged, stands upon the same principles, and is unaffected by the subsequent law. But that part of the decree, directing the abatement of the obstruction, is executory, a continuing decree, which requires not only the removal of the bridge, but enjoins the defendants against any reconstruction or continuance. Now, whether it is a future existing or a continuing obstruction depends upon the question whether or not it interferes with the right of navigation. If, in the mean time, since the decree, this right has been modified by the competent authority, so that the bridge is no longer an unlawful obstruction, it is quite plain the decree of this court can no longer be enforced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeling Bridge II, 59 U.S. at 431-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the post road statute in Wheeling Bridge II directly changed the underlying substantive law (whether the bridge was an unlawful obstruction of navigation), Congress is clearly without power to modify the underlying constitutional rights at stake in prison conditions cases. Congress cannot, for instance, declare whether certain prison conditions violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. See Dickerson v. United States, U.S. __, 120S.Ct. 2326, __, L.Ed.2d__ (U.S. June 26, 2000) (holding that Congress cannot overrule prophylactic remedy designed to prevent violation of constitutional rights); id. at ___, 120 S.Ct. at 2332 (\"Congress may not legislatively supercede our decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution.\"); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 524, 529 (1997) (\"The power to interpret the Constitution in a case or controversy remains in the judiciary. . . . If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be `superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.' \") (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803)); see also Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1086-87. But Congress is free to alter the standard that determines the scope of prospective relief for unconstitutional prison conditions so long as the restrictions on the remedy do not prevent vindication ofthe right. See id.; see also infra, S B.2.i &amp; note 23. And just as in Wheeling Bridge II, the intervening change in the standard applies to all \"continuing decrees.\" See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 273 (1994) (\"When the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the new provision is not retroactive.\"). Conceived therefore as a change in the \"underlying law,\" the PLRA simply amends Rule 60(b) -the rule that otherwise governs courts' power to modify or terminate relief granted pursuant to a final judgment. As the Court put it in French:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By establishing new standards for the enforcement of prospective relief in S3626(b), Congress has altered the relevant underlying law. The PLRA has restricted courts' authority to issue and enforce prospective relief concerning prison conditions, requiring that such relief be supported by findings and precisely tailored to what is needed to remedy the violation of a federal right . . . . As Plaut  and Wheeling Bridge II instruct, when Congress changes the law underlying a judgment awarding prospective relief, that relief is no longer enforceable to the extent it is inconsistent with the new law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">___U.S. at ___ 120 S.Ct. at 2258 (citations omitted); see also Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388 (\"A consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later turns out, one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become impermissible under federal law.\"); Wright, 364 U.S. at 652 (\"The parties have no power to require of the court continuing enforcement of rights the statute no longer gives.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A more serious question would obviously be presented under Plaut if we were to conclude that the termination provisions do more -i.e., that they destroy the underlying contract which is the basis of a consent decree, automatically terminate the jurisdiction of federal courts, or deprive a final judgment (whether rendered by consent or following adjudication) of any collateral effects it may have apart from the prospective relief it enforces. As Judge Calabresi noted in Benjamin, where a final judgment awards only prospective relief, the distinction between requiring a court to terminate such relief if certain conditions are met, and ordering a court to terminate the judgment itself, may seem trivial or formalistic. 172 F.3d at 179-80 (concurring opinion). In both cases, the court is rendered powerless to enforce a remedy it has granted. But in the latter scenario Congress impermissibly arrogates the judicial power to \"say what the law is\" in particular cases and controversies. Marbury, 5 U.S. at 177 (1803)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>.  Thus, although formalistic, the distinction between changing the standard for modifying a judgment and terminating a judgment outright is seminal for purposes of separation of powers analysis. As the Supreme Court has noted in another setting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the Constitution is concerned with setting forth the form of our government, and the courts have traditionally invalidated measures deviating from that form. The result may appear \"formalistic\"in a given case . . . [b]ut the Constitution protects us from our own best intentions: It divides power among sovereigns and among branches of government precisely so that we may resist the temptation to concentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 187 (1992); see also Plaut, 514 U.S. at 239 (separation of powers is a \"structural safeguard\"); Benjamin, 172 F.3d at 180 (Calabresi, J., concurring) (\"[H]ow something is done (i.e., whether a judgment is directly altered or whether the underlying law is changed in such a way as to lead the courts to modify their judgments) can be at least as important as the result that is achieved.\"). Without doing violence to the text or undermining Congress' intent, our reading of the termination provisions permits the conclusion that the PLRA preserves this important distinction and the allocation of powers it safeguards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Prescribing the Rule of Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading also permits the conclusion that the termination provisions do not prescribe a rule of decision within the meaning of United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128 (1871). In that case, the executor of the estate of a Confederate supporter sought to recover the value of the decedent's cotton which was seized by treasury agents of the United States during the Civil War. A statute provided that recovery was available only to individuals who had not \"given aid and comfort\" to the confederacy. This is just what the decedent had done -he \"voluntarily became the surety on the official bonds of certain officers of the rebel confederacy.\" 80 U.S. at 132. He received a Presidential pardon, however, by taking an oath to support the Constitution and the union of the states, and in United States v. Padelford, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 531 (1870), the Supreme Court held that a Presidential pardon would suffice as proof that one had not given aid and comfort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just after the Court's decision in Padelford, while Klein's case was still pending on appeal to the Supreme Court, Congress attempted to reverse the holding in Padelford. It passed a statute providing that a pardon must be taken as conclusive proof that the pardoned person actually gave aid and comfort. See Klein, 80 U.S. at 144 (\"The substance of this enactment is that an acceptance of a pardon, without disclaimer, shall be conclusive evidence of the acts pardoned, but shall be null and void as evidence of the rights conferred by it, both in the Court of Claims and in this court on appeal.\"). The Court held the statute unconstitutional on the ground that it \"prescribes rules of decision to the Judicial Department of the government in cases pending before it.\" Klein, 80 U.S. at 146.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The Court expressly distinguished its decision in Wheeling Bridge II, reasoning that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[n]o arbitrary rule of decision was prescribed in that case, but the court was left to apply its ordinary rules to the new circumstances created by the act. In the case before us no new circumstances have been created by the act. But the court is forbidden to give the effect to evidence which, in its own judgment, such evidence should have, and is directed to give it an effect precisely contrary. We must think that Congress has inadvertently passed the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 146-47.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If S 3626(b) unconditionally directed federal courts to terminate prospective reliefin prison condition cases decided prior to the Act, it would surely run afoul of the rule in Klein. But, plaintiffs' protestations to one side, the Act does no such thing. The \"immediate termination\" made available by S 3626(b)(2) statute is not a unilateral mandate to the courts, leaving no room for adjudication, no room for the exercise of traditional equity powers.

The limits on federal court jurisdiction are essentially the same -no more than necessary to correct the underlying constitutional violation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>.  It is not immediately obvious, therefore, that prospective relief granted in a contested decree which predates the PLRA will flunk the statute's standard. District courts were already bound to follow a nearly identical standard. With respect to consent decrees, of course, any contractual surplusage (relief the court had jurisdiction to enforce only by virtue of the parties' consent) is rendered unenforceable by the termination provisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> but all other relief is untouched by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii.

(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). The Rule codifies the long-established principle of equity practice that a court may, in its discretion, take cognizance of changed circumstances and relieve a party from a continuing decree. As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Swift &amp; Co.:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not doubtful of the power of a court of equity to modify an injunction in adaptation to changed conditions, though it was entered by consent. . . . Power to modify the decree was reserved by its very terms, and from the beginning went hand in hand with its restraints. If the reservation had been omitted, power there still would be by force of principles inherent in the jurisdiction of the chancery. A continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need. The result is all one whether the decree has been entered after litigation or by consent. In either event, a court does not abdicate its power to revoke or modify its mandate, if satisfied that what it has been doing has been turned through changed circumstances into an instrument of wrong.  286 U.S. 106, 114-15 (1932) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); see also Railway Employees v. Wright , 364 U.S. 642, 651. (1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, the Supreme Court considered the application of this rule to a prison conditions consent decree. The Court reversed the district court's conclusion that a consent decree is impervious to modification absent a showing of \" `grievous wrong evoked by new and unforseen circumstances.' \" 502 U.S. at 377 (quoting Swift). Following Rule 60(b)(5), the Court determined that the \"traditional flexible standard for modification of consent decrees\" applies. Id. at 378-79, 383-84. According to this standard, modification is warranted if there is \"a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.\" Id.  at 384. The court also emphasized that the burden of establishing such a change rests on the party seeking modification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, the PLRA creates a more exacting standard for federal courts to follow. But the standard does not eviscerate a district court's equitable discretion and thereby prescribe a rule of decision. First, nothing in the termination provisions can be said to shift the burden of proof from the party seeking to terminate the prospective relief. Second, and more importantly, although S 3626(b)(2) speaks of \"immediate termination,\" and although S 3626(e)(1) requires a \"prompt\" ruling, a district court cannot terminate prospective relief without determining whether the existing relief (in whole or in part) exceeds the constitutional minimum<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>. And, consistent with S 3626(b)(3), a district court cannotterminate or refuse to grant prospective relief necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation, so long as the relief is tailored to the constitutional minimum. Thus, unless plaintiffs do not contest defendants' showing that there is no current and ongoing violation under S 3626(b)(3), the court must inquire into current conditions at a prison before ruling on a motion to terminate. If the existing relief qualifies for termination under S 3626(b)(2), but there is a current and ongoing violation, the district court will have to modify the relief to meet the Act's standards. It is plain that each of these steps requires real adjudication -the careful application of law to fact -not the wooden ratification of a legislatively prescribed conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Due Process and Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pass quickly over plaintiffs' other constitutional objections. No circuit court has found the PLRA to violate due process or the Equal Protection Clause. See supra , notes 2 and 3. We decline to stray from these precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Applying the Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying our construction of the statute to the cases at bar, we conclude that the district courts erred in a number of respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Gilmore</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gilmore, the district court upheld the constitutionality of the Act, following the reasoning of the court in Thompson v. Gomez, 993 F. Supp. at 762-66. The court then quickly turned to two questions: (1) whether the 1972 Order adopting regulations for the prison libraries was issued in the absence of a finding that the relief provided therein was equivalent to the constitutional minimum under S 3626(b)(2); and (2) \"whether the court should now make `written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation'  \" under S 3626(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than place the burden on the state to show that the 1972 Order exceeded the constitutional minimum (recall that in fashioning that Order the court allowed the CDC to select its own means of ensuring inmates' access to the courts, see Gilmore, 319 F. Supp. at 112), the court inquired whether plaintiffs had shown that the 1972 Order was not terminable under S 3626(b)(2). Moreover, the court did not examine the court record and relief granted by the order to determine whether it was narrowly tailored and minimally intrusive -it simply asked whether explicit findings were made. We conclude that the court erred in its allocation of the burden of proof and its exclusive focus on express findings rather thank on whether, in fact, the remedy exceeded the constitutional minimum according to the record and the relevant caselaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also erred in its application of the limiting provision. The court placed the burden on plaintiffs to establish a current and ongoing violation of a Federal right rather than requiring the CDC, which had moved to terminate the decree, to prove its compliance with inmates' right of access to the courts. And although the court correctly read Casey to require evidence of actual injury,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> the court deniedplaintiffs' request for an evidentiary hearing, thereby depriving plaintiffs of the chance to establish that the 1997 memo directing library staff to stop renewing books (or any other of the CDC's actions) would have a concrete effect on inmates' access to the courts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Thompson</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Thompson, plaintiffs conceded that all but four remedies granted in the consent decree and subsequent proceedings were terminable under the PLRA. See Thompson, 993 F. Supp. at 755. The four remaining remedies were: (1) noise control, (2) access to legal materials, (3) the classification of prisoners, and (4) group religious services. The district court separately examined each remedy to determine whether it was either (a) supported by findings of a constitutional violation and narrowly tailored within the meaning ofS 3626(b)(2), at the time it was granted, or (b) necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation. Relying on the existing record, the district court denied plaintiffs' request for an evidentiary hearing on present conditions at San Quentin and held that the findings were inadequate at the time each remedy was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in Gilmore, the district court was required to do more than merely examine the record for \"findings.\" If according to the record and relevant caselaw the prior orders granting relief were indeed narrowly drawn, extended no further than necessary, and were minimally intrusive, termination is improper under S 3626(b)(2). The court was further obliged to take evidence on the current circumstances at the prison as plaintiffs requested, at least with respect to those remedies as to which plaintiffs did not concede that defendants were in compliance. As the Second Circuit held in Benjamin, \"[e]vidence presented at a prior time . . . could not show a violation that is `current and ongoing.' Hence, the `record' referred to [in S 3626(b)(3) ] cannot mean the prior record but must mean a record reflecting conditions as of the time termination is sought.\" 172 F.3d at 166, compare Cagle v. Hutto, 177 F.3d 253, 258 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the noise remedy, the district court concluded: \"The parties seem to agree that at present plaintiffs are not suffering noise levels that constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Defendants have come into compliance with this term of the decree.\" Thompson, 993 F. Supp. at 757. The same can be said with respect to group religious services. The classification system, however, is different. Although the district court also indicated that plaintiffs conceded compliance with the classification system, the court focused on plaintiff's citation to the Monitor's Fourth Report. Id. at 760. The Sixth Report, however, states that there are serious problems with the classification system in the East Block. Therefore, the district court must assess the current conditions with respect to inmate classification on remand -particularly the housing of Grade A inmates with prisoners confined to administrative segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

[S]uch a distinction seems to us to be necessary in light of the delicate accommodations required by the principle of separation of powers reflected in Article III. . . . [W]hen Congress creates a statutory right, it clearly has the discretion, in defining that right, to create presumptions, or assign burdens of proof, or prescribe remedies . . . . Such provisions do, in a sense, affect the judicial power, but they are also incidental to Congess' power to define the right that it has created. No comparable justification exists, however, when the right being adjudicated is not of congressional creation. In such a situation, substantial inroads into functions that have traditionally been performed by the Judiciary cannot be characterized as incidental extensions of Congress' power to define rights that it has created.

S 3626(b)(2). We do not read this to mean that explicit findings must have been made, so long as the record, the court's decision ordering prospective relief, and relevant caselaw fairly disclose that the relief actually meets the S 3626(b)(2) narrow tailoring standard. Otherwise, relief which was in fact narrowly tailored would be subject to termination merely because an express finding to that effect, totally unnecessary under the law at the time of decision, was not made.

Insofar as the right vindicated by Bounds is concerned, \"meaningful access to the courts is the touchstone,\" and the inmate therefore must go one step further and demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.</p>\n        <p>518 U.S. at 351 (quoting Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 823 (1977)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs point to the 1997 Memo as evidence of an imminent violation of a federal right. The argument is that the 1972 Order must be preserved to prevent an imminent violation of their right of meaningful access to the courts. And insofar as S 3626(b)(3) is limited to preserving relief necessary to correct a \"current and ongoing\" violation, plaintiffs claim it violates separation of powers by preventing the courts from providing a remedy necessary to prevent reversion to past unconstitutional practices.</p>\n        <p>There can be no doubt that Congress intended to deprive courts of jurisdiction to continue relief under these circumstances. The Act was amended in 1997 specifically to preclude a court from retaining jurisdiction in the absence of a current and ongoing violation (assuming the terms of S 3626(b)(2) are also met). See Pub L. 105-119, S 123(a)(2), 111 Stat. 2440, 2470 (1997) (substituting \"current and  ongoing\" for \"current or ongoing\"). As the Conference Report states:</p>\n        <p>The provision also includes a change in subsection (b)(3) that corrects the confusing use of the word \"or\" to describe the limited circumstances when a court may continue prospective relief in prison conditions litigation to make clear that a constitutional violation must be \"current and ongoing.\" These dual requirements are necessary to ensure that court orders do not remain in place on the basis of a claim that a current condition that does not violate prisoners' Federal rights nevertheless requires a court decree to address it, because the condition is somehow traceable to a prior policy that did violate Federal rights, or that government officials are \"poised\" to resume a prior violation of Federal rights. If an unlawful practice resumes or if a prisoner is in imminent danger of a constitutional violation, the prisoner has prompt and complete remedies through a new action filed in State or Federal court and preliminary and injunctive relief.</p>\n        <p>H.R. Rep. No. 104-405 S123 (1997) (emphasis added). There can also be no doubt that federal courts have always had discretion to keep injunctive orders in place where reversion to past unlawful practice is indeed imminent. See, e.g., Casey, 518 U.S. at 349 (\"It is the role of the courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual harm . . . . \" ) (emphasis added); Swift, 286 U.S. at 119 (refusing to modify anti-trust consent decree enjoining meat packing companies from anti-competitive practices where reversion to past practices was likely; \"The defendants have abused their powers so grossly and persistently as to lead to the belief that, even when they are acting separately, their conduct should be subjected to extraordinary restraints.\"); see id. (\"The difficulty of ferreting out [sporadic instances of unfair practices] and repressing them when discovered supplies an additional reason why we should leave the defendants where we find them, especially since the place where we find them is the one where they agreed to be . . . . We are not at liberty to reverse under the guise of readjusting.\") (emphasis added); Stone, 968 F.2d at 861.</p>\n        <p>Although this presents a serious separation of powers claim, we decline to reach it for the following reason. On remand, after the district court has had an opportunity to assess the CDC's current policies and practices with respect to inmate access to the courts, the evidence may show a full-blown current and ongoing violation or compliance with the constitution. In the</p>\n        <p>former case, S 3626(b)(3) applies by its terms and plaintiffs would have no standing to challenge the amendment from \"current or ongoing\" to \"current and ongoing.\" In the latter case, plaintiffs' claim would be moot. Thus, in view of our remand, it would be inappropriate for us to adjudicate this question now.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Litigation over prison conditions is a relatively recentaddition to the landscape of federal jurisdiction. As one commentator has observed, \"The Constitution did not breach prison walls for over 170 years. Indeed, during most of the history of this country, there was some question as to whether prisoners had any constitutional rights at all.\" Michael Mushlin, RIGHTS OF PRISONERS S 1.02, at 7 (2d ed. 1993).

And as the Supreme Court summed up the doctrine:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditionally, federal courts have adopted a broad hands-off attitude toward problems of prison administration. In part this policy is the product of various limitations on the scope of federal review of conditions in the state penal institutions. More fundamentally, this attitude springs from complementary perceptions about the nature of the problems and the efficacy of judicial intervention. Prison administrators are responsible for maintaining internal order and discipline, for securing their institutions against unauthorized access or escape, and for rehabilitating, to the extent that human nature and inadequate resources allow, the inmates placed in their custody. The Herculean obstacles to effective discharge of these duties are too apparent to warrant explication. Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree. Most require expertise, comprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative branches of government . . . . Moreover, where state penal institutions are involved, federal courts have a further reason for deference to the appropriate prison authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Procunier v.

The concept of judicial restraint was not jettisoned, just relaxed enough to permit courts to intervene in the event that prison administrators abridge fundamental constitutional rights. As the Court observed in Procunier v. Martinez, \"a policy of judicial restraint cannot encompass any failure to take cognizance of valid constitutional claims whether arising in a federal or state institution. When aprison regulation or practice offends a fundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will discharge their duty to protect constitutional rights. \" 416 U.S. at 405-06 (citing Johnson v.

Thompson</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson is one of the lingering second and third generation prison conditions cases which appear to have occupied Congress' attention in drafting the termination provisions of the PLRA. In the later cases, prison administrators generally elected to enter consent decrees rather than litigate the alleged constitutional violations. See supra, notes 2 and 3 (citing cases involving comprehensive consent decrees). In these negotiated decrees, prison administrators frequently agreed to wide-ranging changes in prison practices that exceeded the constitutional minimum. Moreover, since courts are bound to enforce the terms of the decrees (indeed, this is the key distinction between a private settlement and a consent judgment), courts have often exercised continuing supervision over prisons subject to the decrees. The courts' supervision has been especially \"hands-on\" -e.g., appointing special masters, imposing sanctions for contempt, and modifying or expanding the relief provided by the decrees -where prison administrators have failed to effectuate the terms of the decrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson is a quintessential continuing supervision case. It began as a class action in 1979 by condemned inmates at San Quentin State Prison. Plaintiffs claimed that automatic confinement to administrative segregation constituted cruel and unusual punishment, violated their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion, and abridged each prisoner's right to an individualized assessment of his or her security risk. (By CDC regulation, prisoners in the general population could only be confined to administrative segregation for violating prison rules or posing an inherent threat to institutional security.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year later, the parties entered, and the court approved, a comprehensive consent decree. Thompson v. Enomoto, No. 79-1630-SAW, Consent Decree (Oct. 23, 1980). The decree covered a wide range of issues including procedures for classifying death row inmates according to their security risk, procedures for changing an inmate's classification, out-of-cell activities and schedules, and access to legal materials<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>.  Anticipating a quick transition to full compliance, the court reserved its jurisdiction for one year, adding that \"[a]t the end of one year from the date of this decree, by which time the terms of this decree shall have been implemented, this section shall be dismissed in its entirety.\" Id. at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Due to population increases in the North Segregation Unit, where all the condemned inmates had been housed, some inmates had to be relocated to areas where the prison was unable to provide the full range of privileges granted by the decree. Thus in 1982, the court granted a six month extension of jurisdiction to give prison administrators time to come into compliance. When the prison failed to meet the timetable, plaintiffs moved for a contempt order which the district court denied on the grounds that defendants had been reasonably diligent and the unforeseen circumstance of increased population caused the problem. See Thompson v. Enomoto , <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2283977\"><a href=\"/opinion/2283977/thompson-v-enomoto/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span>, 769-70 (N.D. Cal. 1982). Instead, the court ordered modification of the decree, and directed the parties to negotiate a proposal. Id. at 770<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the parties' negotiations foundered, plaintiffs moved the court to appoint a special master pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court granted plaintiffs' motion and, in 1985, appointed a \"Monitor \" along with an order of reference conferring broad discovery powers and indicating that, absent an objection or clear error, the Monitor's reports would be accepted as the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the court. On appeal, we held that the consent decree implicitly contemplated the appointment of a special master because the court retained authority to establish procedures for ensuring compliance with the decree. See Thompson v. Enomoto, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1323</span></span>, 1327 (9th Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next decade, the Monitor filed six reports, several of which found prison conditions in violation of the decree. The consent decree itself was modified on two occasions (once to give prisoners access to free weights and electronic typewriters in exchange for greater latitude in restraining prisoners outside death row, and once to expand law library access, incorporate noise protections and restrict Grade B prisoner privileges). See Thompson v. Enomoto , <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"549020\"><a href=\"/opinion/549020/maurice-s-thompson-charles-a-green-john-gzikowski-keith-d-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1383</span></a></span>, 1386-90 (9th Cir. 1990) (describing First through Fourth Monitor's reports and upholding district court's decision approving modifications and refusing to vacate decree). In the Sixth Report, a one hundred page document, the Monitor found that prison officials were violating a number of decree provisions, most prominently: (1) housing noncondemned administrative segregation inmates along with Grade A condemned prisoners (a practice that caused violence and disciplinary problems), (2) the use of \"strip-cells\" as a disciplinary measure (i.e., confining inmates to cells containing only a \"strong-blanket\" in nothing but their undershorts); and (3) seriously inadequate access to legal materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court adopted the Sixth Report and denied another request by defendants to modify the decree, defendants moved to terminate the decree under the PLRA. The court granted the motion over plaintiffs' objections on constitutional grounds. See Thompson v. Gomez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286160\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286160/thompson-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

First, they argue that the termination provisions violate separation of powers because the provisions (a) reopen and mandate the termination of final judgments, see Plaut v. Spendthrift Farms, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117916\"><a href=\"/opinion/117916/plaut-v-spendthrift-farm-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span> (1995), and (b) prescribe a rule of decision for the courts. See United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1871). Second, plaintiffs contend that the termination provisions violate their vested due process rights by terminating relief provided by contract and court order. Third, plaintiffs claim that the termination provisions deny prisoners equal protection of the laws by singling out prisoners and burdening their right of access to the courts. Finally, plaintiffs argue that the district courts erred by refusing to grant evidentiary hearings to determine whether there is any current and ongoing violation of federal rights in the prisons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Section 3626(a)(1) of Title 18 provides that prospective relief \"shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\" 18 U.S.C. S 3626(a)(1). Thus a district court faced with a prison conditions suit may not grant or approve prospective relief \"unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\" Id. The provision closes by requiring courts to \"give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief,\" id., and by limiting courts' power to grant preliminary injunctive relief, 18 U.S.C. S 3626(a)(2), or to release prisoners as a sanction for failure to comply with other relief. 18 U.S.C. S 3626(a)(3)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>.Section 3626(a) therefore operates simultaneously to restrict the equity jurisdiction of federal courts and to protect the bargaining power of prison administrators -no longer may courts grant or approve relief that binds prison administrators to do more than the constitutional minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If prospective relief has already been granted by a court, S 3626(b) controls.

Prospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C.

According to these provisions, then, any \"prospective relief\" that exceeds the constitutional minimum must be terminated regardless of when it was granted<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute defines \"prospective relief\" as \"all relief other than compensatory monetary damages.\" 18 U.S.C. S 3626(g)(7). \"Relief,\" in turn, is \"all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court, and includes consent decrees but does not include private settlements.\" 18 U.S.C. S 3626(g)(9). \"Consent decree\" is also a defined term in the statute. It means \"any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlements.\" 18 U.S.C. S 3626(g)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Separation of Powers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two things are immediately apparent from the plain language of S 3626(b) and its defined terms for separation of power purposes. First, S 3626(b)(2) mandates only the termination of prospective relief, it does notrequire a court to terminate or vacate the underlying final judgment (typically a consent decree) which provides for such relief. Second, reading S 3626(b)(2) along with the limiting provision in S 3626(b)(3), any relief that was narrowly tailored in the first instance, and extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, is not terminable. A district court is bound to maintain or modify any form of relief necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of a federal right, so long as that relief is limited to enforcing the constitutional minimum. In short, final judgments are not undone and all of the courts' traditional equitable powers not expressly revoked are retained. So construed, the termination provisions do not impinge on the separation of powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Terminating Final Judgments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of the courts to rule on the termination provisions have concluded that the statute requires nothing less than the termination of consent decrees, and have then proceeded to asddress the grave constitutional question whether Congress can command the courts retroactively to terminate a final judgment. See Dougan, 129 F.3d at 1425-26 (\"Section 3626(b)(2) requires a court to terminate \"prospective relief,\" which includes existing consent decrees. . . . The consent decrees that the PLRA requires courts to review under the statute's more stringent standards are not final judgments for separation-of-powers purposes.\"); Rouse, 129 F.3d at 654-55 (\"[O]nce defendants or intervenors show their entitlement to terminate prospective relief, the Act seemingly requires termination of the consent decree itself. . . . We are therefore duty bound to interpret the PLRA as mandating the termination of extant consent decrees altogether . . . .\"); Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1084, 1087 (\" `Prospective relief' is defined broadly to include all relief other than compensatory damages; it expressly includes consent decrees. . . . In a continuing case, a consent decree is not the `last word' of the courts in the case, even after the decree has become final for purposes of appeal. Rather a consent decree is an executory form of relief that remains subject to later developments.\"); Plyler, 100 F.3d at 369, 371 (same); see also Imprisoned Citizens , 169 F.3d at 182 (section 3626(b)(2) requires a court to \"terminate jurisdiction\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the statute does define \"relief\" to include \"consent decrees,\" it defines \"consent decree\" narrowly. Our sister circuits have not attended to this narrow definition in their construction of the termination provisions. See id. In its ordinary usage, a consent decree is both a contract of settlement and a final judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus, although it provides for injunctiverelief according to terms agreed to by the parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> a consent decree is not merely a form of relief. The PLRA, however, defines a \"consent decree\" exclusively in terms of the relief it provides; specifically, the statute states that \" `consent decree' means any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlement agreements.\" 18 U.S.C. S 3626(g)(1) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are bound to give effect to this explicit statutory definition even though it deviates from common usage. See Meese v. Keene, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111876\"><a href=\"/opinion/111876/meese-v-keene/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 484-85 (1987); Western Union Tel.

Reading the statute as such, the termination provisions do not require the termination of consent decrees or any other final judgments of Article III courts. The provisions apply exclusively to prospective relief, limiting the scope of federal jurisdiction to enforce the prospective aspect of final judgments in prison conditions cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this saving construction, the separation of powers question is relatively straight forward namely, whether Congress may set a new and retroactively applicable standard for obtaining relief from final judgments which impose forward-looking injunctive remedies. This, Congress certainly may do. Although Plaut stands for the proposition that Congress may not enact \"retroactive legislation requiring an Article III court to setaside a final judgment,\" 514 U.S. at 240, that case involved a legislative attempt to reopen the dismissal of suits for money damages under federal securities laws, and the Court was very careful to distinguish legislation that merely \"alter[s] the prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts.\" Id. at 232 (citing Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 421 (1856) (\"Wheeling Bridge II\"), and noting that \"nothing in our holding today calls [Wheeling Bridge II] into question\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative action at issue in Wheeling Bridge II is not directly analogous to the PLRA, but the case nicely demonstrates the applicable rule. In Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., 54 U.S. (13 How.) 518 (1852) (\"Wheeling Bridge I\"), the Supreme Court held that a bridge across the Ohio River was an obstruction of navigation and ordered the bridge raised or removed. Congress responded by enacting legislation establishing the bridge as a post road for U.S. mail service and declaring that the bridge company was authorized to maintain the bridge at its existing height. Nature intervened and the bridge was destroyed by a storm. When the state of Pennsylvania sued to enjoin reconstruction of the bridge, it challenged the post road statute as an unconstitutional attempt to annul the Court's decision in Wheeling Bridge I. The bridge company prevailed on the theory that the statute merely changed the law underlying the permanent injunction granted in Wheeling Bridge I:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, we agree, if the remedy in this case had been an action at law, and a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff for damages, the right to these would have passed beyond the reach of the power of congress. It would have depended, not upon the public right of the free navigation of the river, but upon the judgment of the court. The decree before us, so far as it respect[s] the costs adjudged, stands upon the same principles, and is unaffected by the subsequent law. But that part of the decree, directing the abatement of the obstruction, is executory, a continuing decree, which requires not only the removal of the bridge, but enjoins the defendants against any reconstruction or continuance. Now, whether it is a future existing or a continuing obstruction depends upon the question whether or not it interferes with the right of navigation. If, in the mean time, since the decree, this right has been modified by the competent authority, so that the bridge is no longer an unlawful obstruction, it is quite plain the decree of this court can no longer be enforced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeling Bridge II, 59 U.S. at 431-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the post road statute in Wheeling Bridge II directly changed the underlying substantive law (whether the bridge was an unlawful obstruction of navigation), Congress is clearly without power to modify the underlying constitutional rights at stake in prison conditions cases. Congress cannot, for instance, declare whether certain prison conditions violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. See Dickerson v. United States, U.S. __, 120S.Ct. 2326, __, L.Ed.2d__ (U.S. June 26, 2000) (holding that Congress cannot overrule prophylactic remedy designed to prevent violation of constitutional rights); id. at ___, 120 S.Ct. at 2332 (\"Congress may not legislatively supercede our decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution.\"); City of Boerne v. Flores, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 524, 529 (1997) (\"The power to interpret the Constitution in a case or controversy remains in the judiciary. . . . If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be `superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.' \") (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803)); see also Gavin, 122 F.3d at 1086-87. But Congress is free to alter the standard that determines the scope of prospective relief for unconstitutional prison conditions so long as the restrictions on the remedy do not prevent vindication ofthe right. See id.; see also infra, S B.2.i &amp; note 23. And just as in Wheeling Bridge II, the intervening change in the standard applies to all \"continuing decrees.\" See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 273 (1994) (\"When the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the new provision is not retroactive.\"). Conceived therefore as a change in the \"underlying law,\" the PLRA simply amends Rule 60(b) -the rule that otherwise governs courts' power to modify or terminate relief granted pursuant to a final judgment. As the Court put it in French:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By establishing new standards for the enforcement of prospective relief in S3626(b), Congress has altered the relevant underlying law. The PLRA has restricted courts' authority to issue and enforce prospective relief concerning prison conditions, requiring that such relief be supported by findings and precisely tailored to what is needed to remedy the violation of a federal right . . . . As Plaut  and Wheeling Bridge II instruct, when Congress changes the law underlying a judgment awarding prospective relief, that relief is no longer enforceable to the extent it is inconsistent with the new law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">___U.S. at ___ 120 S.Ct. at 2258 (citations omitted); see also Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388 (\"A consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later turns out, one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become impermissible under federal law.\"); Wright, 364 U.S. at 652 (\"The parties have no power to require of the court continuing enforcement of rights the statute no longer gives.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A more serious question would obviously be presented under Plaut if we were to conclude that the termination provisions do more -i.e., that they destroy the underlying contract which is the basis of a consent decree, automatically terminate the jurisdiction of federal courts, or deprive a final judgment (whether rendered by consent or following adjudication) of any collateral effects it may have apart from the prospective relief it enforces. As Judge Calabresi noted in Benjamin, where a final judgment awards only prospective relief, the distinction between requiring a court to terminate such relief if certain conditions are met, and ordering a court to terminate the judgment itself, may seem trivial or formalistic. 172 F.3d at 179-80 (concurring opinion). In both cases, the court is rendered powerless to enforce a remedy it has granted. But in the latter scenario Congress impermissibly arrogates the judicial power to \"say what the law is\" in particular cases and controversies. Marbury, 5 U.S. at 177 (1803)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>.  Thus, although formalistic, the distinction between changing the standard for modifying a judgment and terminating a judgment outright is seminal for purposes of separation of powers analysis. As the Supreme Court has noted in another setting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the Constitution is concerned with setting forth the form of our government, and the courts have traditionally invalidated measures deviating from that form. The result may appear \"formalistic\"in a given case . . . [b]ut the Constitution protects us from our own best intentions: It divides power among sovereigns and among branches of government precisely so that we may resist the temptation to concentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York v.

Without doing violence to the text or undermining Congress' intent, our reading of the termination provisions permits the conclusion that the PLRA preserves this important distinction and the allocation of powers it safeguards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Prescribing the Rule of Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading also permits the conclusion that the termination provisions do not prescribe a rule of decision within the meaning of United States v.

In that case, the executor of the estate of a Confederate supporter sought to recover the value of the decedent's cotton which was seized by treasury agents of the United States during the Civil War. A statute provided that recovery was available only to individuals who had not \"given aid and comfort\" to the confederacy. This is just what the decedent had done -he \"voluntarily became the surety on the official bonds of certain officers of the rebel confederacy.\" 80 U.S. at 132. He received a Presidential pardon, however, by taking an oath to support the Constitution and the union of the states, and in United States v. Padelford, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 531 (1870), the Supreme Court held that a Presidential pardon would suffice as proof that one had not given aid and comfort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just after the Court's decision in Padelford, while Klein's case was still pending on appeal to the Supreme Court, Congress attempted to reverse the holding in Padelford. It passed a statute providing that a pardon must be taken as conclusive proof that the pardoned person actually gave aid and comfort. See Klein, 80 U.S. at 144 (\"The substance of this enactment is that an acceptance of a pardon, without disclaimer, shall be conclusive evidence of the acts pardoned, but shall be null and void as evidence of the rights conferred by it, both in the Court of Claims and in this court on appeal.\"). The Court held the statute unconstitutional on the ground that it \"prescribes rules of decision to the Judicial Department of the government in cases pending before it.\" Klein, 80 U.S. at 146.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The Court expressly distinguished its decision in Wheeling Bridge II, reasoning that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[n]o arbitrary rule of decision was prescribed in that case, but the court was left to apply its ordinary rules to the new circumstances created by the act. In the case before us no new circumstances have been created by the act. But the court is forbidden to give the effect to evidence which, in its own judgment, such evidence should have, and is directed to give it an effect precisely contrary. We must think that Congress has inadvertently passed the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 146-47.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If S 3626(b) unconditionally directed federal courts to terminate prospective reliefin prison condition cases decided prior to the Act, it would surely run afoul of the rule in Klein. But, plaintiffs' protestations to one side, the Act does no such thing. The \"immediate termination\" made available by S 3626(b)(2) statute is not a unilateral mandate to the courts, leaving no room for adjudication, no room for the exercise of traditional equity powers. This point becomes clear by identifying the degree to which the termination provisions deviate from the general standards for granting and modifying continuing decrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i.

The limits on federal court jurisdiction are essentially the same -no more than necessary to correct the underlying constitutional violation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>.  It is not immediately obvious, therefore, that prospective relief granted in a contested decree which predates the PLRA will flunk the statute's standard. District courts were already bound to follow a nearly identical standard. With respect to consent decrees, of course, any contractual surplusage (relief the court had jurisdiction to enforce only by virtue of the parties' consent) is rendered unenforceable by the termination provisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> but all other relief is untouched by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii.

(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). The Rule codifies the long-established principle of equity practice that a court may, in its discretion, take cognizance of changed circumstances and relieve a party from a continuing decree. As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Swift &amp; Co.:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not doubtful of the power of a court of equity to modify an injunction in adaptation to changed conditions, though it was entered by consent. . . . Power to modify the decree was reserved by its very terms, and from the beginning went hand in hand with its restraints. If the reservation had been omitted, power there still would be by force of principles inherent in the jurisdiction of the chancery. A continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need. The result is all one whether the decree has been entered after litigation or by consent. In either event, a court does not abdicate its power to revoke or modify its mandate, if satisfied that what it has been doing has been turned through changed circumstances into an instrument of wrong.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101912\"><a href=\"/opinion/101912/united-states-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 114-15 (1932) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); see also Railway Employees v.

Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, the Supreme Court considered the application of this rule to a prison conditions consent decree. The Court reversed the district court's conclusion that a consent decree is impervious to modification absent a showing of \" `grievous wrong evoked by new and unforseen circumstances.' \" 502 U.S. at 377 (quoting Swift). Following Rule 60(b)(5), the Court determined that the \"traditional flexible standard for modification of consent decrees\" applies. Id. at 378-79, 383-84. According to this standard, modification is warranted if there is \"a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.\" Id.  at 384. The court also emphasized that the burden of establishing such a change rests on the party seeking modification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, the PLRA creates a more exacting standard for federal courts to follow. But the standard does not eviscerate a district court's equitable discretion and thereby prescribe a rule of decision. First, nothing in the termination provisions can be said to shift the burden of proof from the party seeking to terminate the prospective relief. Second, and more importantly, although S 3626(b)(2) speaks of \"immediate termination,\" and although S 3626(e)(1) requires a \"prompt\" ruling, a district court cannot terminate prospective relief without determining whether the existing relief (in whole or in part) exceeds the constitutional minimum<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>. And, consistent with S 3626(b)(3), a district court cannotterminate or refuse to grant prospective relief necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation, so long as the relief is tailored to the constitutional minimum. Thus, unless plaintiffs do not contest defendants' showing that there is no current and ongoing violation under S 3626(b)(3), the court must inquire into current conditions at a prison before ruling on a motion to terminate. If the existing relief qualifies for termination under S 3626(b)(2), but there is a current and ongoing violation, the district court will have to modify the relief to meet the Act's standards. It is plain that each of these steps requires real adjudication -the careful application of law to fact -not the wooden ratification of a legislatively prescribed conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Due Process and Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pass quickly over plaintiffs' other constitutional objections. No circuit court has found the PLRA to violate due process or the Equal Protection Clause. See supra , notes 2 and 3. We decline to stray from these precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Applying the Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying our construction of the statute to the cases at bar, we conclude that the district courts erred in a number of respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Gilmore</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gilmore, the district court upheld the constitutionality of the Act, following the reasoning of the court in Thompson v. Gomez, 993 F. Supp. at 762-66. The court then quickly turned to two questions: (1) whether the 1972 Order adopting regulations for the prison libraries was issued in the absence of a finding that the relief provided therein was equivalent to the constitutional minimum under S 3626(b)(2); and (2) \"whether the court should now make `written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation'  \" under S 3626(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than place the burden on the state to show that the 1972 Order exceeded the constitutional minimum (recall that in fashioning that Order the court allowed the CDC to select its own means of ensuring inmates' access to the courts, see Gilmore, 319 F. Supp. at 112), the court inquired whether plaintiffs had shown that the 1972 Order was not terminable under S 3626(b)(2). Moreover, the court did not examine the court record and relief granted by the order to determine whether it was narrowly tailored and minimally intrusive -it simply asked whether explicit findings were made. We conclude that the court erred in its allocation of the burden of proof and its exclusive focus on express findings rather thank on whether, in fact, the remedy exceeded the constitutional minimum according to the record and the relevant caselaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also erred in its application of the limiting provision. The court placed the burden on plaintiffs to establish a current and ongoing violation of a Federal right rather than requiring the CDC, which had moved to terminate the decree, to prove its compliance with inmates' right of access to the courts. And although the court correctly read Casey to require evidence of actual injury,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> the court deniedplaintiffs' request for an evidentiary hearing, thereby depriving plaintiffs of the chance to establish that the 1997 memo directing library staff to stop renewing books (or any other of the CDC's actions) would have a concrete effect on inmates' access to the courts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Thompson</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Thompson, plaintiffs conceded that all but four remedies granted in the consent decree and subsequent proceedings were terminable under the PLRA. See Thompson, 993 F. Supp. at 755. The four remaining remedies were: (1) noise control, (2) access to legal materials, (3) the classification of prisoners, and (4) group religious services. The district court separately examined each remedy to determine whether it was either (a) supported by findings of a constitutional violation and narrowly tailored within the meaning ofS 3626(b)(2), at the time it was granted, or (b) necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation. Relying on the existing record, the district court denied plaintiffs' request for an evidentiary hearing on present conditions at San Quentin and held that the findings were inadequate at the time each remedy was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in Gilmore, the district court was required to do more than merely examine the record for \"findings.\" If according to the record and relevant caselaw the prior orders granting relief were indeed narrowly drawn, extended no further than necessary, and were minimally intrusive, termination is improper under S 3626(b)(2). The court was further obliged to take evidence on the current circumstances at the prison as plaintiffs requested, at least with respect to those remedies as to which plaintiffs did not concede that defendants were in compliance. As the Second Circuit held in Benjamin, \"[e]vidence presented at a prior time . . . could not show a violation that is `current and ongoing.' Hence, the `record' referred to [in S 3626(b)(3) ] cannot mean the prior record but must mean a record reflecting conditions as of the time termination is sought.\" 172 F.3d at 166, compare Cagle v. Hutto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764154\"><a href=\"/opinion/764154/wilburn-g-cagle-calvin-ruud-carter-phillip-g-patterson-clarence-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 258 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the noise remedy, the district court concluded: \"The parties seem to agree that at present plaintiffs are not suffering noise levels that constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Defendants have come into compliance with this term of the decree.\" Thompson, 993 F. Supp. at 757. The same can be said with respect to group religious services. The classification system, however, is different. Although the district court also indicated that plaintiffs conceded compliance with the classification system, the court focused on plaintiff's citation to the Monitor's Fourth Report. Id. at 760. The Sixth Report, however, states that there are serious problems with the classification system in the East Block. Therefore, the district court must assess the current conditions with respect to inmate classification on remand -particularly the housing of Grade A inmates with prisoners confined to administrative segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

No comparable justification exists, however, when the right being adjudicated is not of congressional creation.

The argument is that the 1972 Order must be preserved to prevent an imminent violation of their right of meaningful access to the courts. And insofar as S 3626(b)(3) is limited to preserving relief necessary to correct a \"current and ongoing\" violation, plaintiffs claim it violates separation of powers by preventing the courts from providing a remedy necessary to prevent reversion to past unconstitutional practices.</p>\n        <p>There can be no doubt that Congress intended to deprive courts of jurisdiction to continue relief under these circumstances. The Act was amended in 1997 specifically to preclude a court from retaining jurisdiction in the absence of a current and ongoing violation (assuming the terms of S 3626(b)(2) are also met). See Pub L. 105-119, S 123(a)(2), 111 Stat. 2440, 2470 (1997) (substituting \"current and  ongoing\" for \"current or ongoing\"). As the Conference Report states:</p>\n        <p>The provision also includes a change in subsection (b)(3) that corrects the confusing use of the word \"or\" to describe the limited circumstances when a court may continue prospective relief in prison conditions litigation to make clear that a constitutional violation must be \"current and ongoing.\" These dual requirements are necessary to ensure that court orders do not remain in place on the basis of a claim that a current condition that does not violate prisoners' Federal rights nevertheless requires a court decree to address it, because the condition is somehow traceable to a prior policy that did violate Federal rights, or that government officials are \"poised\" to resume a prior violation of Federal rights. If an unlawful practice resumes or if a prisoner is in imminent danger of a constitutional violation, the prisoner has prompt and complete remedies through a new action filed in State or Federal court and preliminary and injunctive relief.</p>\n        <p>H.R. Rep. No. 104-405 S123 (1997) (emphasis added). There can also be no doubt that federal courts have always had discretion to keep injunctive orders in place where reversion to past unlawful practice is indeed imminent. See, e.g., Casey, 518 U.S. at 349 (\"It is the role of the courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual harm . . . . \" ) (emphasis added); Swift, 286 U.S. at 119 (refusing to modify anti-trust consent decree enjoining meat packing companies from anti-competitive practices where reversion to past practices was likely; \"The defendants have abused their powers so grossly and persistently as to lead to the belief that, even when they are acting separately, their conduct should be subjected to extraordinary restraints.\"); see id. (\"The difficulty of ferreting out [sporadic instances of unfair practices] and repressing them when discovered supplies an additional reason why we should leave the defendants where we find them, especially since the place where we find them is the one where they agreed to be . . . . We are not at liberty to reverse under the guise of readjusting.\") (emphasis added); Stone, 968 F.2d at 861.</p>\n        <p>Although this presents a serious separation of powers claim, we decline to reach it for the following reason. On remand, after the district court has had an opportunity to assess the CDC's current policies and practices with respect to inmate access to the courts, the evidence may show a full-blown current and ongoing violation or compliance with the constitution. In the</p>\n        <p>former case, S 3626(b)(3) applies by its terms and plaintiffs would have no standing to challenge the amendment from \"current or ongoing\" to \"current and ongoing.\" In the latter case, plaintiffs' claim would be moot. Thus, in view of our remand, it would be inappropriate for us to adjudicate this question now.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
