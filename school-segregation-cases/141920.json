For the\n\nreasons explained below, the Motion to Dismiss will be GRANTED\n\nand the Motion for Summary Judgment will be GRANTED IN PART AND\n\nDENIED IN PART.\n\n\n  I.     BACKGROUND\n\n\n  Plaintiffs Charles Ludlam and Paula Hirschoff are former Peace\n\nCorps volunteers.     Both plaintiffs have been advocates for\n\nstrengthening and revitalizing the Peace Corps; they have served\n\non the boards of non-profit organizations supporting returned\n\nPeace Corps volunteers and testified before Congress on behalf\n\nof current Peace Corps volunteers.    Compl. ¶¶ 3-5.\n\f    On April 15, 2009, plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request seeking\n\nproduction, in electronic format, of a country-by-country\n\nbreakout of the Peace Corps’ 2008 survey of its Volunteers.\n\nCompl. ¶ 18.   The Peace Corps acknowledged the information\n\nexisted, but stated that it “is not available in the format\n\n[plaintiffs] asked for.”   Compl. ¶ 24.     The Peace Corps informed\n\nplaintiffs that it would cost anywhere from approximately $850 -\n\n$3100 for the Peace Corps to search for and produce the\n\ninformation, and that production would not be electronic.        Id.\n\n¶¶ 24-28.\n\n\n    On May 27, 2009, plaintiffs filed an appeal of the Peace\n\nCorps’ decisions regarding the document production format and\n\ncosts.   Id. ¶ 29.   While the appeal was pending, plaintiffs were\n\napproached by a Peace Corps staffer who informed plaintiffs that\n\nthe country-by-country breakout of the 2008 survey was\n\navailable, in electronic format.       Id. ¶ 31.   The staffer emailed\n\nthe information to plaintiffs, who then posted it on the\n\nPeaceCorpsWiki website.    Id. ¶ 31.    On June 24, 2009, the Acting\n\nDirector of the Peace Corps Office of Management emailed Ludlam,\n\nnoted that the information he sought was available on\n\nPeaceCorpsWiki, and concluded “it doesn’t appear necessary for\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n \n\f[the Peace Corps] to continue to staff your request for these.”\n\nId. ¶ 33.\n\n\n       On December 16, 2010, Ludlam submitted a second FOIA request,\n\nseeking “a copy of the Peace Corps comprehensive survey of the\n\nVolunteers for 2009 and 2010, [including] the worldwide results\n\nand the breakouts of the results country by country and program\n\nby program for each country.”                                        Id. ¶ 40.1   On March 17, 2011, the\n\nFOIA officer provided aggregated worldwide summary results of\n\nthe 2009 and 2010 Annual Volunteer Surveys (“AVS”), but informed\n\nMr. Ludlam that the individual country and program survey\n\nresults were withheld under Exemptions 5 and 6 of FOIA.                                         Id. ¶\n\n48.           Specifically, the agency claimed the information sought was\n\nexempt from disclosure because it was covered by the\n\ndeliberative process privilege, or because it involved matters\n\nof personal privacy.                                           Id.\n\n\n       Mr. Ludlam appealed the decision on March 18, 2011.                                    In his\n\nappeal, Mr. Ludlam narrowed his request to omit Volunteer\n\nresponses to “open-ended questions” in the AVS.                                         Id. ¶ 49.   On\n\nApril 15, 2011, Earl Yates, Associate Director for Management at\n\nthe Peace Corps, released to Mr. Ludlam the 2009 and 2010\n\nresults on a regional level. See Miller Decl. ¶ 17.                                         However,\n                                                            \n1\n   Each Peace Corps post has a number of programs or “projects”\nsuch as education, health and agriculture. Defendant’s Motion\nto Dismiss or for Summary Judgment (“Def.’s Mot.”) Att. B,\nDeclaration of Denora Miller (“Miller Decl.”) ¶ 16.\n                                                                      3\n \n\fYates denied his appeal for country-by-country and program-by-\n\nprogram responses, citing the same Exemptions.     Id. ¶ 12, 17.\n\n\n    Plaintiffs filed this action on August 31, 2011, challenging\n\nonly the denial of the December 16, 2010 FOIA request.    Shortly\n\nthereafter, the Peace Corps released additional information to\n\nMr. Ludlam.    On or about January 31, 2012, the Peace Corps\n\nprovided Ludlam a significant portion of the country-by-country\n\nand program-by-program AVS results for 2009 and 2010.    Miller\n\nDecl. ¶ 14.    The Peace Corps continued to withhold, in whole or\n\nin part, Volunteer responses to seven questions in the 2009 AVS\n\nand ten questions in the 2010 AVS on a country-by-country and\n\nprogram-by-program breakouts.    Id.   On February 2, 2012, the\n\ndefendant moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary\n\njudgment.    The motion is now ripe for the Court’s decision.\n\n\n    II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          A. Motion to Dismiss\n\n\n      Exhaustion of administrative remedies in FOIA cases is\n\n“generally required before filing suit in federal court so that\n\nthe agency has an opportunity to exercise its discretion and\n\nexpertise on the matter and to make a factual record to support\n\nits decision.” Oglesby v. Dep’t of Army, 920 F.2d 57, 61 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1990) (overruled in part on other grounds).    FOIA requires\n\nthe requester to exhaust administrative remedies; when a\n\n                                  4\n \n\fdefendant disputes that a FOIA plaintiff has done so, the matter\n\nis properly the subject of a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) for\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\nHidalgo v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 344 F.3d 1256, 1260\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003).\n\n\n          B. Summary Judgment\n\n\n     Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary\n\njudgment should be granted if the moving party has shown that\n\nthere are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.     See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986);\n\nWaterhouse v. District of Columbia, 298 F.3d 989, 991 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2002).    In determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists,\n\nthe court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving party.     See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith\n\nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).    Likewise, in ruling on\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment, the court shall grant\n\nsummary judgment only if one of the moving parties is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law upon material facts that are not\n\ngenuinely disputed.     See Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in\n\nWash. v. Dep’t of Justice, 658 F. Supp. 2d 217, 224 (D.D.C.\n\n2009) (citing Rhoads v. McFerran, 517 F.2d 66, 67 (2d Cir.\n\n1975)).\n\n\n                                   5\n \n\f       C. FOIA\n\n\n     FOIA requires agencies to disclose all requested agency\n\nrecords, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a), unless one of nine specific\n\nstatutory exemptions applies, id. § 552(b).     It is designed to\n\n“pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency\n\naction to the light of public scrutiny.”   Dep’t of Air Force v.\n\nRose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976) (citations omitted).    “Given the\n\nFOIA’s broad disclosure policy, the United States Supreme Court\n\nhas ‘consistently stated that FOIA exemptions are to be narrowly\n\nconstrued.’” Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\n\n(quoting Dep’t of Justice v. Julian, 486 U.S. 1, 8 (1988)).\n\n\n     “FOIA’s strong presumption in favor of disclosure places\n\nthe burden on the agency to justify the withholding of any\n\nrequested documents.”   Dep’t of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 173\n\n(1991) (citation omitted).   The government may satisfy its\n\nburden of establishing its right to withhold information from\n\nthe public by submitting appropriate declarations and, where\n\nnecessary, an index of the information withheld.     See Vaughn v.\n\nRosen, 484 F.2d 820, 827-28 (D.C. Cir. 1973).    “If an agency’s\n\naffidavit describes the justifications for withholding the\n\ninformation with specific detail, demonstrates that the\n\ninformation withheld logically falls within the claimed\n\nexemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence in the\n\n\n                                 6\n \n\frecord or by evidence of the agency’s bad faith, then summary\n\njudgment is warranted on the basis of the affidavit alone.”\n\nACLU v. Dep’t of the Defense, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011); see id. (an agency’s justification for invoking a FOIA\n\nexemption is sufficient if it appears logical or plausible)\n\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n\n    III. DISCUSSION\n\n         A. Dismissal as to Plaintiff Hirschoff\n\n\n      The Peace Corps argues that plaintiff Paula Hirschoff must\n\nbe dismissed from this case because she did not file the\n\nDecember 16, 2010 FOIA request, which is the only request at\n\nissue in this lawsuit.   Def.’s Mot. at 6-8.     The plaintiffs do\n\nnot oppose defendant’s argument.       Plaintiffs’ Opposition to\n\nMotion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment at 5-6 (“Pls.’\n\nOpp’n”).    Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss\n\nplaintiff Hirschoff is GRANTED.\n\n\n      The parties also do not dispute that the remaining\n\nplaintiff, Charles Ludlam, has properly exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies.    Accordingly, the dismissal of Ms.\n\nHirschoff does not impact the Court’s ability to consider the\n\ncase on its merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                   7\n \n\f       B. Waiver\n     As a threshold matter, plaintiff argues that the Peace\n\nCorps has waived the right to invoke Exemptions 5 and 6\n\nregarding the withheld responses from the country-by-country and\n\nprogram-by-program breakouts of the 2009 and 2010 AVS.\n\nPlaintiff claims waiver because (1) the agency previously\n\ndisclosed the responses from substantially similar questions in\n\nthe 2008 Volunteer survey, and (2) Peace Corps leaders are\n\nencouraged to, and do, share the 2009 and 2010 AVS responses\n\nwith other with other Peace Corps staff.   Pls.’ Opp’n at 31-34.\n\nDefendant, by contrast, contends that the plaintiff cannot\n\ndemonstrate that the responses to the 2009 and 2010 AVS surveys\n\nmatch the responses to the 2008 surveys; therefore, the Peace\n\nCorps has not waived any FOIA exemption.   Def.’s Reply at 24-25.\n\nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court agrees with defendant\n\nand finds that no waiver occurred.\n\n\n      In this Circuit, the “public-domain doctrine” has emerged\n\nas the dominant paradigm for evaluating the waiver of a\n\npotential FOIA exemption.   “Under [the] public-domain doctrine,\n\nmaterials normally immunized from disclosure under FOIA lose\n\ntheir protective cloak once disclosed and preserved in a\n\npermanent public record.”   Cottone v. Reno, 193 F.3d 550, 554\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted).   The logic of this\n\ndoctrine is that “where information requested ‘is truly public,\n\n                                 8\n \n\fthen enforcement of an exemption cannot fulfill its purposes.’”\n\nId. (citations omitted).    “[A] plaintiff asserting that\n\ninformation has been previously disclosed bears the initial\n\nburden of pointing to specific information in the public domain\n\nthat duplicates that being withheld.”      Public Citizen v. Dep’t\n\nof State, 11 F.3d 198, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1993).     An allegation that\n\nsimilar information has been released is not sufficient.      Id.\n\n\n     In this case, plaintiff’s waiver argument fails because he\n\nhas not shown that the withheld responses match any information\n\nalready in the public domain.   He argues only that the questions\n\ncontained in the 2009 and 2010 AVS are substantially identical\n\nto the questions in the 2008 survey.    However, as defendant\n\nnotes, it is the responses to the surveys that plaintiff seeks,\n\nnot the questions.   Def.’s Reply at 25.    Considering that the\n\nresponses to the later surveys were provided by a different\n\ngroup of volunteers, regarding their experiences during a\n\ndifferent time period, the responses will not be identical to\n\nthose provided in 2008.    Certainly, the plaintiff has not\n\ndemonstrated, with specificity, that the previous disclosure\n\nduplicates withheld information.\n\n\n     The fact that the Peace Corps encouraged readers of the\n\nsurveys to share information with other staff cannot salvage\n\nplaintiff’s claim of waiver.    While agency leaders may have\n\n\n                                   9\n \n\fdisseminated the survey results within the agency, the plaintiff\n\nhas not shown that Peace Corps officials were authorized to, or\n\ndid, release 2009 or 2010 survey results to the general public\n\noutside the agency.     See Muslim Advocates v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 833 F. Supp. 2d 92, 100 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\n\n     Accordingly, the Court finds that the Peace Corps has not\n\nwaived its right to invoke Exemptions 5 and 6 with respect to\n\nthe withheld material.\n\n\n       C. Exemption 6\n\n\n     Exemption 6 covers “personnel and medical files and similar\n\nfiles the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly\n\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6).\n\nA determination of proper withholding under Exemption 6 proceeds\n\nin two stages.   First, the Court must decide if the information\n\nis subject to protection, specifically, whether the information\n\nis contained in a personnel, medical, or similar file, and if\n\nso, whether “disclosure would compromise a substantial, as\n\nopposed to a de minimis, privacy interest.     If no significant\n\nprivacy interest is implicated, (and if no other Exemption\n\napplies), FOIA demands disclosure.” Nat’l Ass’n of Retired Fed.\n\nEmployees v. Horner, 879 F.2d 873, 874 (D.C. Cir. 1989).     If, on\n\nthe other hand, a substantial privacy interest is at stake, the\n\nCourt must then “weigh the privacy interest in nondisclosure\n\n                                  10\n \n\fagainst the public interest in the release of records in order\n\nto determine whether, on balance, the disclosure would work a\n\nclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Lepelletier\n\nv. FDIC, 164 F.3d 37, 46 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).                                   The agency bears the burden to persuade the\n\nCourt that the exemption applies.                                         Ripskis v. HUD, 746 F.2d 1, 3\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1984).\n\n\n              The Peace Corps argues that Exemption 6 applies to three\n\ntypes of questions in the 2009 and 2010 AVS.                                        The Court will\n\naddress them in turn.\n\n\n                             1. First Type of Question:                     Rating Staff Performance\n\n\n              The Peace Corps withheld complete or partial answers to\n\nseveral questions regarding staff performance.                                        First, it\n\nwithheld the answers to questions F2 in the 2009 AVS survey and\n\nF3 in the 2010 survey.2                                        These questions are identical, and ask\n\n“How satisfied are you with the health care received from your\n\nPCMO(s) [Peace Corps Medical Officer]?”                                        The Volunteers can\n\nprovide six possible responses (“Not at all, Minimally,\n\nAdequately, Considerably, Exceptionally and Not Used”).\n\n                                                            \n2\n   Unless otherwise noted, the Court takes all facts regarding\nthe questions and withheld responses from the Defendant’s\nMotion, Exhibit 10 (Table of Withheld Responses); Exhibit 1\n(2009 AVS), Exhibit 2 (2010 AVS), and Exhibit 14 (Vaughn index),\nas well as Plaintiff’s Opposition, Exhibit 1 (Chart of Withheld\nResponses).\n                                                                     11\n \n\f     The Peace Corps also withheld partial answers to identical\n\nquestions F3 (2009 AVS) and F4 (2010 AVS).    These questions ask\n\n“How satisfied are you with the following support provided by\n\nin-country Peace Corps staff?” and permitted the following\n\nresponses: “Not at all, Minimally, Adequately, Considerably,\n\nExceptionally and Not Used.”   The questions were then broken out\n\ninto separate sub-questions for ten different staff positions/\n\nfunctions.   Of these ten, the Peace Corps withheld responses as\n\nto four:   Medical, Safety and Security, Site Selection and\n\nPreparation, and Technical Skills.\n\n\n     Partial responses to identical questions F6 (2009 AVS) and\n\nF6 (2010 AVS) were also withheld.     These questions ask “How\n\nwould you rate your interaction with post staff?” and permitted\n\nthe responses of “Adequate” or “Not Adequate.”    The questions\n\nwere broken into separate sub-questions as to four topics:\n\n“responsiveness to my issues,”   “informative content,”   “My\n\ncomfort level discussing issues,” and “Adequacy of Visits/Visits\n\nto your site.”   They were further broken out into separate sub-\n\nquestions for eight different staff positions. Of these eight,\n\nthe Peace Corps withheld responses for six: Country Director,\n\nProgram Training Officer/Sub-Regional Program Training\n\nCoordinator, Associate Peace Corps Director/Program Manager,\n\nPCMO, Safety and Security Coordinator, Training Manager.\n\n\n\n                                 12\n \n\f     Finally, questions F7 (2009 AVS) and F9 (2010 AVS) ask “To\n\nwhat extent is your Country Director aware of Volunteer issues\n\nand concerns through interactions with Volunteers?” and permits\n\nresponses of “Not at all, Minimally, Adequately, Considerably,\n\nCompletely/Exceptionally.”\n\n\n            2. Second Type of Question: Insensitive and\n               Discriminatory Conduct/Harassment\n     The Peace Corps partially withheld the answer to question\n\nG2 (AVS 2010).   This question asks whether Volunteers “[H]ave\n\nencountered insensitive comments or behavior toward you based on\n\nyour race, ethnicity, age, gender, or sexual orientation from\n\nany of the following sources?”   Volunteers could respond Yes,\n\nNo, or Not Applicable.   The question is separated into four\n\ncategories of people who might have engaged in such conduct.\n\nThe Peace Corps withheld responses for two categories:\n\nHost/Homestay Family and Community members.\n\n\n     Responses to question G3 (AVS 2010) were also partially\n\nwithheld.   This question asks Volunteers to report any\n\ndiscrimination/harassment they have encountered.   The question\n\nidentifies several types of discrimination: age, anti-American,\n\ndisability, gender, racial/color, religious, sexual orientation,\n\nsexual (physical) and sexual (verbal).   Volunteers could respond\n\nwith the number of times they had (i) encountered that type of\n\nharassment/discrimination, and (ii) reported it to the Peace\n\n                                 13\n \n\fCorps.   The question is further broken down into seven different\n\ncategories of persons responsible for the harassment.    The Peace\n\nCorps has withheld responses for two of the categories:\n\n“counterpart, supervisor, co-worker (not Peace Corps)” and “Host\n\nCountry Family Member.”\n\n\n           3. Third Type of Question: Crime\n\n\n     The Peace Corps partially withheld responses to question G4\n\n(2010 AVS), which asks whether Volunteers were victims of any of\n\nseveral different types of crime committed by several different\n\ncategories of individuals.   Volunteers could respond by\n\nidentifying the number of times they had (i) experienced that\n\ntype of crime, and (ii) reported it to the Peace Corps.    The\n\nPeace Corps has withheld the responses to three of the crimes\n\nlisted -- sexual assault, rape, and attempted rape –- for two\n\ncategories of individuals – “counterpart, supervisor or co-\n\nworker (not Peace Corps)” or “host country family member.”\n\n\n           4. Analysis\n\n             a. Only the Questions Rating Staff Performance\n                Satisfy The Threshold Requirement for Exemption 6\n     Exemption 6 allows an agency to withhold personal\n\nidentifying information, such as “place of birth, date of birth\n\n. . . employment history, and comparable data,” if disclosure of\n\nsuch information “would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\n\n                                14\n \n\finvasion of personal privacy.”    Dep’t of State v. Washington\n\nPost Co., 456 U.S. 595, 600 (1982).    By contrast, “[i]nformation\n\nunrelated to any particular person presumably would not satisfy\n\nthe threshold test.”   Id. at 602 n.4.    Specifically, Exemption 6\n\ndoes not apply if there is no “substantial likelihood that any\n\nconcrete facts about a particular individual could be inferred”\n\nas a result of the release of the withheld information.     Horner,\n\n879 F.2d at 878; see also Dep’t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S.\n\nat 380 n. 19 (“Exemption 6 was directed at threats to privacy\n\ninterests more palpable than mere possibilities”); Arieff v.\n\nDepartment of the Navy, 712 F.2d 1462, 1468 (D.C. Cir. 1983)\n\n(Exemption 6 only applicable where the release of information\n\nleads to likelihood of actual identification; release of\n\ninformation leading to increased speculation about individuals\n\nis not subject to withholding).\n\n\n     In this case, the Peace Corps has met the threshold with\n\nrespect to the first category of questions withheld – those\n\nrelated to staff ratings.   The agency has explained that it\n\nwithheld responses that rate specific staff positions, and at\n\nthe country or project level, these positions are “typically\n\nfilled by one person or a few at most.”    Benjamin Decl. ¶ 14.\n\nThe plaintiff has provided no information to the contrary.\n\nAccordingly, there is more than a “mere possibility” that\n\n\n\n                                  15\n \n\femployment ratings data could be linked to a particular\n\nindividual if this information were released.                                      Moreover,\n\nemployees have a substantial privacy interest in their\n\nemployment ratings data.                                       See, e.g., Fed’l Labor Relations\n\nAuthority v. Dep’t of Commerce, 962 F.2d 1055, 1059 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1992) (employee ratings containing either favorable or\n\nderogatory information is personal information subject to\n\nExemption 6); Ripskis, 746 F.2d 1 (same).3\n\n\n                    The Peace Corps has not met the threshold exemption,\n\nhowever, for responses to the second or third types of\n\nquestions.                         As set forth above, the second type of question\n\nrelates to insensitive comments or behavior from Volunteers’ (a)\n\nhost families or (b)community members, or discrimination/\n\nharassment they have encountered from their (a) counterparts,\n\nsupervisors, or co-workers, or (b) host families.                                      On their\n\nface, these categories seem very likely to include a large\n\nnumber of individuals, and the agency has provided no indication\n\nto the contrary.                                     The Peace Corps relies on the declarations of\n\n                                                            \n3\n  Plaintiff argues that any privacy interest in the ratings data\nhas been abolished because the readers of the country-by-country\nreports are “encouraged to share the results with staff and\nVolunteers.” Opp’n at 12. Courts have held, however, that the\nmere fact that some information may be known to certain members\nof the public does not negate an individual’s privacy interest\nin preventing further dissemination to the public at large.\nSee, e.g., Forest Serv. Employees v. U.S. Forest Serv., 524 F.3d\n1021, 1025 n.3 (9th Cir. 2008); Barnard v. Dept of Homeland\nSec., 598 F. Supp. 2d 1, 12 (D.D.C. 2009) (collecting cases).\n                                                                    16\n \n\femployees Denora Miller and Esther Benjamin for support, but\n\nthese declarations do not demonstrate any likelihood that the\n\nwithheld information could be linked to a particular individual.\n\n\n     Ms. Miller states that there were 7671 Volunteers in 2009\n\nand 8655 in 2010, that the country-by-country and program-by-\n\nprogram numbers are significantly smaller, and then concludes\n\n“it would be possible for anyone familiar with the Peace Corps .\n\n. . to determine the identities of individuals . . .       identified\n\nas sources of improper behavior or comments, or pointed to as\n\ncriminals.”   Miller Decl. ¶ 33.        This is insufficient; as\n\ndiscussed supra, the “mere possibility” of a threat to privacy\n\ninterest is not sufficient to justify withholding under\n\nExemption 6. Rose, 425 U.S. at 380 n. 19.        Ms. Benjamin’s\n\ndeclaration is also insufficient.       She states that disclosure of\n\ninformation regarding discrimination, harassment and crimes on\n\nthe “smaller” country or project basis,\n\n\n     [M]ay easily identify or be perceived in the host country\n     as identifying specific host family/homestay family\n     members, specific host country citizen members of the\n     community where the Volunteer lives and works, and\n     counterparts/co-workers (such as co-teachers, co-workers in\n     a health clinic, or other host country colleagues with whom\n     a Volunteer works), or management (such as school\n     principals, health clinic directors, agricultural\n     cooperative managers, and other non Peace Corps management\n     personnel).\nBenjamin Decl. ¶ 15.   The bare assertion that a specific\n\nindividual “may easily [be] identif[ied],” unsupported by any\n\n                                   17\n \n\finformation such as the number of Volunteers in any country or\n\nprogram, the typical size of the host families with whom\n\nVolunteers stay, or the size of the communities or workplaces in\n\nwhich Volunteers are placed, is simply not enough for the agency\n\nto meet its burden to demonstrate that the exemption applies.\n\nSee, e.g., Gardels v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 689 F.2d 1100,\n\n1104-05 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (agency affidavits must be reasonably\n\nspecific, not merely conclusory, to show that the documents are\n\nexempt from disclosure).   Accordingly, because the Peace Corps\n\nhas provided no reasonable basis to determine that any\n\nparticular individuals will be identified by disclosure of the\n\nAVS questions regarding discrimination/harassment or crime\n\nvictimization, the agency’s invocation of Exemption 6 fails.\n\n\n             b. Weighing the Privacy Interest in Nondisclosure\n                Against the Public Interest in the Release of\n                Records\n     Once an agency has established  a substantial privacy\n\ninterest is at stake, the Court must then “weigh the privacy\n\ninterest in nondisclosure against the public interest in the\n\nrelease of records in order to determine whether, on balance,\n\nthe disclosure would work a clearly unwarranted invasion of\n\npersonal privacy.”   Lepelletier, 164 F.3d at 46 (citations\n\nomitted).   The phrase “clearly unwarranted” within the statute\n\n“instructs the court to tilt the balance in favor of\n\n\n\n                                18\n \n\fdisclosure.”   Getman v. NLRB, 450 F.2d 670, 674 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1971).\n\n\n     In the FOIA context, the definition of “public interest” is\n\nlimited.   ““The only relevant public interest in the FOIA\n\nbalancing analysis [is] the extent to which disclosure of the\n\ninformation sought would ‘shed light on an agency’s performance\n\nof its statutory duties’ or otherwise let citizens know ‘what\n\ntheir government is up to.’”   United States Dep’t of Defense v.\n\nFLRA, 510 U.S. 487, 497 (1994) (citations omitted).   The court\n\nmust therefore weigh the privacy interest of Peace Corps staff\n\nin the non-disclosure of the survey questions rating their\n\nperformance against the extent to which the disclosure of this\n\ninformation would shed light on the agency’s “performance of its\n\nstatutory duties” or otherwise let citizens know “what their\n\ngovernment is up to.”   Id.\n\n\n     In this case, plaintiff claims the requested information\n\nwill serve the public interest by revealing information about\n\n“the safety of and the support given to Peace Corps Volunteers,”\n\nmandated by Congress in the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer\n\nProtection Act of 2011 (“Volunteer Protection Act”), which\n\namended the Peace Corps Act, 22 U.S.C. § 2507.   Opp’n at 18-19.\n\nThe new provisions charge the Peace Corps with providing a\n\nvariety of protections for Volunteers who are victims of sexual\n\n\n                                19\n \n\fassault.   22 U.S.C. §§ 2507a – 2507d.     More generally, the new\n\nprovisions institute robust reporting requirements about\n\nVolunteers and Peace Corps staff.       Congress has directed the\n\nPeace Corps to provide it with the results of Annual Volunteer\n\nSurveys, and also with Inspector General Reports containing,\n\ninter alia, “reports received from volunteers relating to\n\nmisconduct, mismanagement or policy violations of Peace Corps\n\nStaff.”    Id. §§ 2507e(c) and (d).     Congress further directed the\n\nPresident to perform a country by country portfolio review for\n\neach country the Peace Corps serves.       Id. § 2507e(e) (emphasis\n\nadded).    The portfolio review, which must be provided to\n\nCongress upon request, “shall at a minimum include,” inter alia,\n\n(i) an analysis of the safety and security of Volunteers, and\n\n(ii) an evaluation of the effectiveness of management of each\n\nPeace Corps post.     Id.   Finally, the new provisions of the Act\n\nrequire the President to submit to Congress, on an annual basis,\n\na report including “the annual rate of early termination of\n\nvolunteers, including demographic data associated with such\n\nearly termination.”     Id. § 2507i.\n\n\n     Plaintiff argues that this legislation demonstrates the\n\npublic interest in “the safety and well-being of the Volunteers,\n\n[which] depend[s], in large part, on the effectiveness of and\n\nprofessionalism of the Peace Corps staff.”      Opp’n at 19.   The\n\n\n\n                                   20\n \n\fgovernment, for its part, does not acknowledge the Kate Puzey\n\nPeace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011.    Rather, it claims\n\nthat the information in the staff ratings data would not\n\ncontribute to the public’s understanding of the Peace Corps’\n\noperations or activities.   Reply at 15.   Even if there is public\n\ninterest in the information, the government claims that interest\n\nis satisfied by the disclosure of the information aggregated at\n\nthe global or regional level.    Id. at 13-14.\n\n\n     Upon consideration, the Court concludes that there is a\n\nsignificant public interest in disclosure of the responses to\n\nquestions regarding staff performance.     The 2011 Amendments to\n\nthe Peace Corps Act make clear that the Agency’s mission\n\nincludes protecting the safety and security of the Volunteers,\n\nas well as ensuring that Peace Corps personnel are effectively\n\nmanaging the agency’s operations at a country by country level.\n\nThese are precisely the concerns addressed in the AVS questions\n\nrelating to staff performance:   Volunteer access to health care,\n\nsupport from staff in substantive areas including safety and\n\nsecurity, and staff awareness of and responsiveness to\n\nVolunteers’ concerns.   See AVS 2009 and 2010 Questions F2, F3,\n\nF4, F6, F7.   Disclosure of this information would therefore\n\nserve the very public interest central to the purposes of FOIA\n\nby furthering the right of the public to know “what their\n\n\n\n                                 21\n \n\fgovernment is up to.” United States Dep’t of Justice v.\n\nReporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989).\n\n\n     The Court further concludes that there is a significant\n\npublic interest disclosure of this information on a country-by-\n\ncountry basis.   As plaintiff explains, Volunteers are invited to\n\nserve in specific countries, where they are overseen by a Peace\n\nCorps Country Director “who is the executive leader of the Peace\n\nCorps for that country.”   Opp’n at 11.   Moreover, plaintiff\n\ncontends, it was the “safety of Volunteers, and the inadequate\n\nsupport some victims of violence received from the Peace Corps\n\nand the host country in which they serve,” which prompted the\n\nmedia attention that led to the Volunteer Protection Act of\n\n2011. Id. at 18.   Finally, as set forth above, Congress has\n\nrecognized the importance of having access to this information\n\non a country by country basis. See 22 U.S.C. § 2507e(e).     By\n\ncontrast, Plaintiff has not produced any support for his claim\n\nthat there is public interest in program-by-program survey\n\nresults within each country.   The Court therefore cannot\n\nconclude that the program-by-program data is relevant to the\n\npublic’s ability to monitor whether the agency is correctly\n\ndoing its job.\n\n\n     Through the new reporting requirements, the amendments to\n\nthe Act provide that much of the information plaintiff seeks\n\n\n                                22\n \n\fwill be publically available in future years.    However, the\n\ninformation obtained in the 2009 and 2010 AVS predates the new\n\nrequirements.   Accordingly, without the data from the AVS, the\n\npublic would have more difficulty determining whether the Peace\n\nCorps has been, and is, carrying out its mission to protect and\n\nsupport its Volunteers.     See Multi AG Media LLC v. Dep’t of\n\nAgric., 515 F.3d 1224, 1231-32 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (finding a\n\nstrong public interest in disclosing data the Department of\n\nAgriculture collects to monitor its program administration).\n\n\n     Having found greater than a de minimis privacy interest and\n\na significant public interest in disclosure of the country-by-\n\ncountry staff rating questions in the AVS, the Court must now\n\n“balance the two to determine whether the agency has met its\n\nburden to show that the substantial interest in personal privacy\n\nis not outweighed by the public interest in disclosure. . .\n\n[U]nless the invasion of privacy is ‘clearly unwarranted,’ the\n\npublic interest in disclosure must prevail and the agency may\n\nnot withhold the files under Exemption 6.”     Id., 515 F.3d at\n\n1232 (citations omitted).\n\n\n     In this case, the Peace Corps’ employees’ privacy interests\n\nare modest.   As set forth above, plaintiff seeks survey\n\nresponses to multiple choice questions regarding Volunteer\n\nexperience with staff performance.     The survey responses are not\n\n\n                                  23\n \n\fofficial performance reviews or ratings, nor do they contain\n\nnames or any other personal details regarding any staff members.\n\nBy contrast, there is a strong public interest in monitoring the\n\nPeace Corps’ protection of Volunteers’ safety and security,\n\nwhich must necessarily include effective management within each\n\ncountry.                     Accordingly, release of this information would not\n\n“constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy”\n\nunder Exemption 6.\n\n\n                      D. Exemption 5\n\n\n              Exemption 5 allows an agency to withhold “inter-agency or\n\nintra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available\n\nby law to a party . . . in litigation with the agency.”                                           5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(6).                                            Citing Exemption 5’s deliberative process\n\nprivilege, the Peace Corps has withheld responses to all of the\n\nAVS questions also withheld under Exemption 6, as well as\n\nresponses to all or part of three additional questions.\n\n\n              First, the Peace Corps withheld the response to question F1\n\n(2009 and 2010 AVS), which are identical in both surveys.4                                            It\n\nasks volunteers how prepared the host country people were for\n\ntheir arrival when they first arrived at their host community,\n                                                            \n4\n  Unless otherwise noted, the Court takes all facts regarding the\nquestions and withheld responses from the Defendant’s Motion,\nExhibit 10 (Table of Withheld Responses); Exhibit 1 (2009 AVS),\nExhibit 2 (2010 AVS), and Exhibit 14 (Vaughn index), as well as\nPlaintiff’s Opposition, Exhibit 1 (Chart of Withheld Responses).                                            \n\n                                                                         24\n \n\fand permits responses of “not at all,” “minimally/poorly,”\n\n“adequately,” “considerably/well” and “exceptionally/very well.”\n\n\n     Responses to question J1 (2009 and 2010 AVS), also\n\nidentical in both surveys, were partially withheld.    The\n\nquestion asks how personally rewarding Volunteers found their\n\nPeace Corps service, and provides five separate categories for\n\n“Overall Peace Corps Service,” “Community Involvement,”\n\n“Experience with Other Volunteers,” “Work with\n\nCounterparts/Community Partner,” and “Experience with other Host\n\nCountry Nationals/Individuals.”    Volunteers could respond “not\n\nat all,” “minimally,” “adequately,” “considerably,” and\n\n“exceptionally.”   Of the five categories, the Peace Corps\n\nwithheld responses as to one:   work with counterparts/community\n\npartner.\n\n\n     Finally, the Peace Corps withheld the responses to\n\nidentical questions F6 (2009 AVS) and F5 (2010 AVS).   These\n\nquestions ask Volunteers whether their host country would\n\nbenefit the most if the Peace Corps program was discontinued,\n\nreduced, refocused/redesigned, maintained as it, or expanded.\n\nVolunteers could choose one of these options.\n\n\n     The deliberative process privilege “covers documents\n\nreflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberation\n\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and\n\n                                  25\n \n\fpolicies are formulated.”   Dep’t of the Interior v. Klamath\n\nWater Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8 (2001) (citations\n\nomitted). The purpose of this privilege is to “prevent injury to\n\nthe quality of agency decisions,” by protecting from disclosure\n\nconfidential, pre-decisional advice and counsel on matters of\n\npolicy.   NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975).\n\nIn order for the deliberative process privilege to apply, the\n\nmaterial must be both “predecisional” and “deliberative.”\n\nPublic Citizen, Inc. v. OMB, 598 F.3d 865, 876 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\n\n(citation omitted).   A document is predecisional if it was\n\ngenerated before the agency action was finally adopted, and\n\ndeliberative if it “reflects the give-and-take of the\n\nconsultative process.”   Id. at 874 (citation omitted).\n\n\n     The Peace Corps asserts that each of the survey responses\n\nwithheld is predecisional because (1) Peace Corps officials rely\n\nheavily on these responses in the continuing process of\n\nformulating agency strategies and policies; and (2) the surveys\n\nthemselves state that they will “be used by the Peace Corps to\n\nidentify best practices and implement program improvements” and\n\n“will contribut[e] to the improvement of the Peace Corps’\n\noperations and, ultimately, to the success of the Peace Corps.”\n\nDef.’s Mot. at 38-39, see also Declaration of Alice-Lynn Ryssman\n\nat ¶¶ 10-13.   In her declaration, Peace Corps official Esther\n\n\n\n                                26\n \n\fBenjamin states that “AVS data are used in agency strategic\n\nplanning and performance activities . . . assessments of agency\n\nperformance . . . [and] internal monitoring at cohort, project,\n\npost, regional, and global levels[.]”   Benjamin Decl. ¶ 11.\n\nPlaintiff responds that “the generalized and aspirational agency\n\ngoals and functions” set forth in the agency declarations “are\n\nnot decisions within the meaning of the statute. . . .   Indeed,\n\nvirtually any action or information considered by the Peace\n\nCorps conceivably could fit within this definition and thus be\n\nwithheld from public disclosure.”   Opp’n at 27.\n\n\n     The Court agrees with plaintiff.   Although the government\n\nneed not pinpoint a specific decision or policy in connection\n\nwith which predecisional material is prepared, the deliberative\n\nprocess must be capable of some definition.   Compare Access\n\nReports v. DOJ, 926 F.2d 1192, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (finding an\n\nagency’s study of how to shepherd a FOIA bill through Congress\n\nto be a defined process) with Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136,\n\n1143 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (finding an agency’s efforts to evaluate\n\nand change its personnel policies, rules and standards too\n\namorphous to qualify as a process for the purposes of the\n\ndeliberative process privilege).\n\n\n     In Vaughn, the agency asserted that reports appraising the\n\nperformance of agency supervisors were protected under the\n\n\n                               27\n \n\fdeliberative process privilege because they were part of an\n\n“ongoing [] process” in which “the agency evaluates and changes\n\nits personnel policies, regulations and standards.”     523 F.2d at\n\n1143.    The Circuit rejected the argument, finding that the\n\nagency could not classify its ongoing, continual task of\n\nappraising, evaluating and making recommendations for\n\nimprovement as a seamless “process” for the purposes of the\n\ndeliberative process privilege, since such a definition places\n\nvirtually no limit on the privilege.     Id. at 1145.   To allow\n\nsuch an expansive definition of the term process under Exemption\n\n5, the Court reasoned, “would swallow up a substantial part of\n\nthe administrative process, and virtually foreclose all public\n\nknowledge regarding the implementation of . . . policies in any\n\ngiven agency.”     Id.\n\n\n        Defendant’s arguments fail for the same reason as the\n\ngovernment’s did in Vaughn.     The Peace Corps asserts generally\n\nthat the AVS surveys are part of the agency’s processes for\n\nongoing, continuous appraisals and improvements in all manner of\n\nagency activities, from strategic planning, to program\n\nimprovement, to assessment of agency performance and beyond.\n\nRyssman Decl. ¶¶ 10-13; Benjamin Decl. ¶¶ 10-13.    To permit the\n\nDefendant to assert the deliberative process privilege for every\n\npiece of information which could be used, in some way or\n\n\n\n                                  28\n \n\fanother, in the continuous process of improving the Agency would\n\nset virtually no limit on the privilege.    Exemption 5’s\n\nprotections do not reach nearly this far.\n\n\n     Further contradicting the Peace Corps’ stated rationale for\n\nwithholding under Exemption 5 is the fact that the agency\n\nproduced most of the responses to the surveys.   The Court is\n\nparticularly puzzled by this because the Agency asserts that the\n\nentire AVS results are used to shape agency policy and\n\ndecisionmaking.   See Ryssman Decl. ¶¶ 10-13, Benjamin Decl. ¶¶\n\n10-13.   The Agency offers no explanation as to why the withheld\n\ninformation constitutes pre-decisional deliberations connected\n\nto an agency policy or action, while the other responses in the\n\nsame documents are not.   In order to show that material is\n\ndeliberative, the agency must identify “what deliberative\n\nprocess is involved and the role played by the documents at\n\nissue in the course of that process.”   Coastal States Gas Corp.\n\nv. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F. 2d 854, 868 (D.C. Cir. 1980).      Here,\n\nthe Peace Corps has failed to do either.    Accordingly, the Court\n\nfinds the agency has not met its burden to demonstrate that the\n\nwithheld materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative, and\n\ntherefore that the documents are not properly withheld under\n\nExemption 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                29\n \n\f          E. Segregability\n\n\n     Plaintiff does not dispute that all reasonably segregable\n\ninformation was produced to him.      Even after determination that\n\ndocuments are exempt from disclosure, however, FOIA analysis is\n\nnot properly concluded unless a court determines whether “any\n\nreasonably segregable portion of a record” can “be provided to\n\nany person requesting such record after deletion of the portions\n\nwhich are exempt.”    5 U.S.C. § 552(b).   “So important is this\n\nrequirement that ‘[b]efore approving the application of a FOIA\n\nexemption, the district court must make specific findings of\n\nsegregability regarding the documents to be withheld.’”      Elec.\n\nFrontier Found. v. Dep’t of Justice, 826 F. Supp. 2d 157, 173\n\n(D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d\n\n1106)).    The Court errs if it “simply approve[s] the withholding\n\nof an entire document without entering a finding on\n\nsegregability or the lack thereof.”      Powell v. U.S. Bureau of\n\nPrisons, 927 F.2d 1239, 1242 n. 4 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n\n     “It has long been the rule in this Circuit that non-exempt\n\nportions of a document must be disclosed unless they are\n\ninextricably intertwined with exempt portions.”      Mead Data\n\nCent., Inc. v. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1977).    The agency should, for example, “‘describe what\n\n\n                                 30\n \n\fproportion of the information in [the] documents,’ if any, ‘is\n\nnon-exempt and how that material is dispersed through the\n\ndocument[s].”     Elec. Frontier Found., 826 F. Supp. 2d at 174\n\n(citing Mead Data Cent., Inc., 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1977)); see King v. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 219 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1987) (agency must sufficiently identify the withheld\n\nmaterial to enable the district court to make a rational\n\ndecision whether the withheld material must be produced without\n\nactually viewing the documents).\n\n\n        Upon review of the documents, the Court finds that the\n\ndefendants have made very limited, specific redactions with\n\nrespect to the program-by-program survey results, and have\n\nexplained in detail the basis for those redactions.     See Miller\n\nDecl. ¶¶ 14, 16, 18, 35.    It appears that defendants have\n\nredacted only what was necessary to protect the exempt\n\ninformation, and defendants are not withholding any documents in\n\nfull.     Accordingly, the Court finds that all segregable\n\ninformation in the program-by-program results of the 2009 and\n\n2010 AVS has been disclosed to plaintiff.\n\n\n    IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n        For all of the foregoing reasons, defendant’s motion to\n\ndismiss is GRANTED. The Court concludes that the Peace Corps was\n\njustified in withholding the Volunteer responses in the program-\n\n\n                                  31\n \n\fby-program breakouts for the following questions:   2009 AVS -\n\nF2, F3, F6, F7; 2010 AVS – F2, F3, F4, F6.   The Peace Corps did\n\nnot justify withholding of any other document at issue.\n\nAccordingly, defendant’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED\n\nIN PART AND DENIED IN PART.

For the\n\nreasons explained below, the Motion to Dismiss will be GRANTED\n\nand the Motion for Summary Judgment will be GRANTED IN PART AND\n\nDENIED IN PART.\n\n\n  I.     BACKGROUND\n\n\n  Plaintiffs Charles Ludlam and Paula Hirschoff are former Peace\n\nCorps volunteers.     Both plaintiffs have been advocates for\n\nstrengthening and revitalizing the Peace Corps; they have served\n\non the boards of non-profit organizations supporting returned\n\nPeace Corps volunteers and testified before Congress on behalf\n\nof current Peace Corps volunteers.    Compl. ¶¶ 3-5.\n\f    On April 15, 2009, plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request seeking\n\nproduction, in electronic format, of a country-by-country\n\nbreakout of the Peace Corps’ 2008 survey of its Volunteers.\n\nCompl. ¶ 18.   The Peace Corps acknowledged the information\n\nexisted, but stated that it “is not available in the format\n\n[plaintiffs] asked for.”   Compl. ¶ 24.     The Peace Corps informed\n\nplaintiffs that it would cost anywhere from approximately $850 -\n\n$3100 for the Peace Corps to search for and produce the\n\ninformation, and that production would not be electronic.        Id.\n\n¶¶ 24-28.\n\n\n    On May 27, 2009, plaintiffs filed an appeal of the Peace\n\nCorps’ decisions regarding the document production format and\n\ncosts.   Id. ¶ 29.   While the appeal was pending, plaintiffs were\n\napproached by a Peace Corps staffer who informed plaintiffs that\n\nthe country-by-country breakout of the 2008 survey was\n\navailable, in electronic format.       Id. ¶ 31.   The staffer emailed\n\nthe information to plaintiffs, who then posted it on the\n\nPeaceCorpsWiki website.    Id. ¶ 31.    On June 24, 2009, the Acting\n\nDirector of the Peace Corps Office of Management emailed Ludlam,\n\nnoted that the information he sought was available on\n\nPeaceCorpsWiki, and concluded “it doesn’t appear necessary for\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n \n\f[the Peace Corps] to continue to staff your request for these.”\n\nId. ¶ 33.\n\n\n       On December 16, 2010, Ludlam submitted a second FOIA request,\n\nseeking “a copy of the Peace Corps comprehensive survey of the\n\nVolunteers for 2009 and 2010, [including] the worldwide results\n\nand the breakouts of the results country by country and program\n\nby program for each country.”                                        Id. ¶ 40.1   On March 17, 2011, the\n\nFOIA officer provided aggregated worldwide summary results of\n\nthe 2009 and 2010 Annual Volunteer Surveys (“AVS”), but informed\n\nMr. Ludlam that the individual country and program survey\n\nresults were withheld under Exemptions 5 and 6 of FOIA.                                         Id. ¶\n\n48.           Specifically, the agency claimed the information sought was\n\nexempt from disclosure because it was covered by the\n\ndeliberative process privilege, or because it involved matters\n\nof personal privacy.                                           Id.\n\n\n       Mr. Ludlam appealed the decision on March 18, 2011.                                    In his\n\nappeal, Mr. Ludlam narrowed his request to omit Volunteer\n\nresponses to “open-ended questions” in the AVS.                                         Id. ¶ 49.   On\n\nApril 15, 2011, Earl Yates, Associate Director for Management at\n\nthe Peace Corps, released to Mr. Ludlam the 2009 and 2010\n\nresults on a regional level. See Miller Decl. ¶ 17.                                         However,\n                                                            \n1\n   Each Peace Corps post has a number of programs or “projects”\nsuch as education, health and agriculture.

B,\nDeclaration of Denora Miller (“Miller Decl.”) ¶ 16.\n                                                                      3\n \n\fYates denied his appeal for country-by-country and program-by-\n\nprogram responses, citing the same Exemptions.     Id. ¶ 12, 17.\n\n\n    Plaintiffs filed this action on August 31, 2011, challenging\n\nonly the denial of the December 16, 2010 FOIA request.    Shortly\n\nthereafter, the Peace Corps released additional information to\n\nMr. Ludlam.    On or about January 31, 2012, the Peace Corps\n\nprovided Ludlam a significant portion of the country-by-country\n\nand program-by-program AVS results for 2009 and 2010.    Miller\n\nDecl. ¶ 14.    The Peace Corps continued to withhold, in whole or\n\nin part, Volunteer responses to seven questions in the 2009 AVS\n\nand ten questions in the 2010 AVS on a country-by-country and\n\nprogram-by-program breakouts.    Id.   On February 2, 2012, the\n\ndefendant moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary\n\njudgment.    The motion is now ripe for the Court’s decision.\n\n\n    II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          A. Motion to Dismiss\n\n\n      Exhaustion of administrative remedies in FOIA cases is\n\n“generally required before filing suit in federal court so that\n\nthe agency has an opportunity to exercise its discretion and\n\nexpertise on the matter and to make a factual record to support\n\nits decision.” Oglesby v.

Summary Judgment\n\n\n     Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary\n\njudgment should be granted if the moving party has shown that\n\nthere are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

DISCUSSION\n\n         A. Dismissal as to Plaintiff Hirschoff\n\n\n      The Peace Corps argues that plaintiff Paula Hirschoff must\n\nbe dismissed from this case because she did not file the\n\nDecember 16, 2010 FOIA request, which is the only request at\n\nissue in this lawsuit.   Def.’s Mot. at 6-8.     The plaintiffs do\n\nnot oppose defendant’s argument.       Plaintiffs’ Opposition to\n\nMotion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment at 5-6 (“Pls.’\n\nOpp’n”).    Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss\n\nplaintiff Hirschoff is GRANTED.\n\n\n      The parties also do not dispute that the remaining\n\nplaintiff, Charles Ludlam, has properly exhausted his\n\nadministrative remedies.    Accordingly, the dismissal of Ms.\n\nHirschoff does not impact the Court’s ability to consider the\n\ncase on its merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                   7\n \n\f       B. Waiver\n     As a threshold matter, plaintiff argues that the Peace\n\nCorps has waived the right to invoke Exemptions 5 and 6\n\nregarding the withheld responses from the country-by-country and\n\nprogram-by-program breakouts of the 2009 and 2010 AVS.\n\nPlaintiff claims waiver because (1) the agency previously\n\ndisclosed the responses from substantially similar questions in\n\nthe 2008 Volunteer survey, and (2) Peace Corps leaders are\n\nencouraged to, and do, share the 2009 and 2010 AVS responses\n\nwith other with other Peace Corps staff.   Pls.’ Opp’n at 31-34.\n\nDefendant, by contrast, contends that the plaintiff cannot\n\ndemonstrate that the responses to the 2009 and 2010 AVS surveys\n\nmatch the responses to the 2008 surveys; therefore, the Peace\n\nCorps has not waived any FOIA exemption.   Def.’s Reply at 24-25.\n\nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court agrees with defendant\n\nand finds that no waiver occurred.\n\n\n      In this Circuit, the “public-domain doctrine” has emerged\n\nas the dominant paradigm for evaluating the waiver of a\n\npotential FOIA exemption.   “Under [the] public-domain doctrine,\n\nmaterials normally immunized from disclosure under FOIA lose\n\ntheir protective cloak once disclosed and preserved in a\n\npermanent public record.”   Cottone v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184976\"><a href=\"/opinion/184976/cottone-salvatore-v-reno-janet/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted).   The logic of this\n\ndoctrine is that “where information requested ‘is truly public,\n\n                                 8\n \n\fthen enforcement of an exemption cannot fulfill its purposes.’”\n\nId. (citations omitted).    “[A] plaintiff asserting that\n\ninformation has been previously disclosed bears the initial\n\nburden of pointing to specific information in the public domain\n\nthat duplicates that being withheld.”      Public Citizen v. Dep’t\n\nof State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658535\"><a href=\"/opinion/658535/public-citizen-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (D.C.

Id.\n\n\n     In this case, plaintiff’s waiver argument fails because he\n\nhas not shown that the withheld responses match any information\n\nalready in the public domain.   He argues only that the questions\n\ncontained in the 2009 and 2010 AVS are substantially identical\n\nto the questions in the 2008 survey.    However, as defendant\n\nnotes, it is the responses to the surveys that plaintiff seeks,\n\nnot the questions.   Def.’s Reply at 25.    Considering that the\n\nresponses to the later surveys were provided by a different\n\ngroup of volunteers, regarding their experiences during a\n\ndifferent time period, the responses will not be identical to\n\nthose provided in 2008.    Certainly, the plaintiff has not\n\ndemonstrated, with specificity, that the previous disclosure\n\nduplicates withheld information.\n\n\n     The fact that the Peace Corps encouraged readers of the\n\nsurveys to share information with other staff cannot salvage\n\nplaintiff’s claim of waiver.    While agency leaders may have\n\n\n                                   9\n \n\fdisseminated the survey results within the agency, the plaintiff\n\nhas not shown that Peace Corps officials were authorized to, or\n\ndid, release 2009 or 2010 survey results to the general public\n\noutside the agency.

The Court will\n\naddress them in turn.\n\n\n                             1. First Type of Question:                     Rating Staff Performance\n\n\n              The Peace Corps withheld complete or partial answers to\n\nseveral questions regarding staff performance.                                        First, it\n\nwithheld the answers to questions F2 in the 2009 AVS survey and\n\nF3 in the 2010 survey.2                                        These questions are identical, and ask\n\n“How satisfied are you with the health care received from your\n\nPCMO(s) [Peace Corps Medical Officer]?”                                        The Volunteers can\n\nprovide six possible responses (“Not at all, Minimally,\n\nAdequately, Considerably, Exceptionally and Not Used”).\n\n                                                            \n2\n   Unless otherwise noted, the Court takes all facts regarding\nthe questions and withheld responses from the Defendant’s\nMotion, Exhibit 10 (Table of Withheld Responses); Exhibit 1\n(2009 AVS), Exhibit 2 (2010 AVS), and Exhibit 14 (Vaughn index),\nas well as Plaintiff’s Opposition, Exhibit 1 (Chart of Withheld\nResponses).\n                                                                     11\n \n\f     The Peace Corps also withheld partial answers to identical\n\nquestions F3 (2009 AVS) and F4 (2010 AVS).    These questions ask\n\n“How satisfied are you with the following support provided by\n\nin-country Peace Corps staff?” and permitted the following\n\nresponses: “Not at all, Minimally, Adequately, Considerably,\n\nExceptionally and Not Used.”   The questions were then broken out\n\ninto separate sub-questions for ten different staff positions/\n\nfunctions.   Of these ten, the Peace Corps withheld responses as\n\nto four:   Medical, Safety and Security, Site Selection and\n\nPreparation, and Technical Skills.\n\n\n     Partial responses to identical questions F6 (2009 AVS) and\n\nF6 (2010 AVS) were also withheld.     These questions ask “How\n\nwould you rate your interaction with post staff?” and permitted\n\nthe responses of “Adequate” or “Not Adequate.”    The questions\n\nwere broken into separate sub-questions as to four topics:\n\n“responsiveness to my issues,”   “informative content,”   “My\n\ncomfort level discussing issues,” and “Adequacy of Visits/Visits\n\nto your site.”   They were further broken out into separate sub-\n\nquestions for eight different staff positions. Of these eight,\n\nthe Peace Corps withheld responses for six: Country Director,\n\nProgram Training Officer/Sub-Regional Program Training\n\nCoordinator, Associate Peace Corps Director/Program Manager,\n\nPCMO, Safety and Security Coordinator, Training Manager.\n\n\n\n                                 12\n \n\f     Finally, questions F7 (2009 AVS) and F9 (2010 AVS) ask “To\n\nwhat extent is your Country Director aware of Volunteer issues\n\nand concerns through interactions with Volunteers?” and permits\n\nresponses of “Not at all, Minimally, Adequately, Considerably,\n\nCompletely/Exceptionally.”\n\n\n            2. Second Type of Question: Insensitive and\n               Discriminatory Conduct/Harassment\n     The Peace Corps partially withheld the answer to question\n\nG2 (AVS 2010).   This question asks whether Volunteers “[H]ave\n\nencountered insensitive comments or behavior toward you based on\n\nyour race, ethnicity, age, gender, or sexual orientation from\n\nany of the following sources?”   Volunteers could respond Yes,\n\nNo, or Not Applicable.   The question is separated into four\n\ncategories of people who might have engaged in such conduct.\n\nThe Peace Corps withheld responses for two categories:\n\nHost/Homestay Family and Community members.\n\n\n     Responses to question G3 (AVS 2010) were also partially\n\nwithheld.   This question asks Volunteers to report any\n\ndiscrimination/harassment they have encountered.   The question\n\nidentifies several types of discrimination: age, anti-American,\n\ndisability, gender, racial/color, religious, sexual orientation,\n\nsexual (physical) and sexual (verbal).   Volunteers could respond\n\nwith the number of times they had (i) encountered that type of\n\nharassment/discrimination, and (ii) reported it to the Peace\n\n                                 13\n \n\fCorps.   The question is further broken down into seven different\n\ncategories of persons responsible for the harassment.    The Peace\n\nCorps has withheld responses for two of the categories:\n\n“counterpart, supervisor, co-worker (not Peace Corps)” and “Host\n\nCountry Family Member.”\n\n\n           3. Third Type of Question: Crime\n\n\n     The Peace Corps partially withheld responses to question G4\n\n(2010 AVS), which asks whether Volunteers were victims of any of\n\nseveral different types of crime committed by several different\n\ncategories of individuals.   Volunteers could respond by\n\nidentifying the number of times they had (i) experienced that\n\ntype of crime, and (ii) reported it to the Peace Corps.    The\n\nPeace Corps has withheld the responses to three of the crimes\n\nlisted -- sexual assault, rape, and attempted rape –- for two\n\ncategories of individuals – “counterpart, supervisor or co-\n\nworker (not Peace Corps)” or “host country family member.”\n\n\n           4.

Only the Questions Rating Staff Performance\n                Satisfy The Threshold Requirement for Exemption 6\n     Exemption 6 allows an agency to withhold personal\n\nidentifying information, such as “place of birth, date of birth\n\n. . . employment history, and comparable data,” if disclosure of\n\nsuch information “would constitute a clearly unwarranted\n\n\n                                14\n \n\finvasion of personal privacy.”    Dep’t of State v.

As set forth above, the second type of question\n\nrelates to insensitive comments or behavior from Volunteers’ (a)\n\nhost families or (b)community members, or discrimination/\n\nharassment they have encountered from their (a) counterparts,\n\nsupervisors, or co-workers, or (b) host families.                                      On their\n\nface, these categories seem very likely to include a large\n\nnumber of individuals, and the agency has provided no indication\n\nto the contrary.

Cir.\n\n1971).\n\n\n     In the FOIA context, the definition of “public interest” is\n\nlimited.   ““The only relevant public interest in the FOIA\n\nbalancing analysis [is] the extent to which disclosure of the\n\ninformation sought would ‘shed light on an agency’s performance\n\nof its statutory duties’ or otherwise let citizens know ‘what\n\ntheir government is up to.’”   United States Dep’t of Defense v.\n\nFLRA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112932\"><a href=\"/opinion/112932/department-of-defense-v-flra/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 497 (1994) (citations omitted).   The court\n\nmust therefore weigh the privacy interest of Peace Corps staff\n\nin the non-disclosure of the survey questions rating their\n\nperformance against the extent to which the disclosure of this\n\ninformation would shed light on the agency’s “performance of its\n\nstatutory duties” or otherwise let citizens know “what their\n\ngovernment is up to.”   Id.\n\n\n     In this case, plaintiff claims the requested information\n\nwill serve the public interest by revealing information about\n\n“the safety of and the support given to Peace Corps Volunteers,”\n\nmandated by Congress in the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer\n\nProtection Act of 2011 (“Volunteer Protection Act”), which\n\namended the Peace Corps Act, 22 U.S.C. § 2507.   Opp’n at 18-19.\n\nThe new provisions charge the Peace Corps with providing a\n\nvariety of protections for Volunteers who are victims of sexual\n\n\n                                19\n \n\fassault.   22 U.S.C. §§ 2507a – 2507d.     More generally, the new\n\nprovisions institute robust reporting requirements about\n\nVolunteers and Peace Corps staff.       Congress has directed the\n\nPeace Corps to provide it with the results of Annual Volunteer\n\nSurveys, and also with Inspector General Reports containing,\n\ninter alia, “reports received from volunteers relating to\n\nmisconduct, mismanagement or policy violations of Peace Corps\n\nStaff.”    Id. §§ 2507e(c) and (d).     Congress further directed the\n\nPresident to perform a country by country portfolio review for\n\neach country the Peace Corps serves.       Id. § 2507e(e) (emphasis\n\nadded).    The portfolio review, which must be provided to\n\nCongress upon request, “shall at a minimum include,” inter alia,\n\n(i) an analysis of the safety and security of Volunteers, and\n\n(ii) an evaluation of the effectiveness of management of each\n\nPeace Corps post.     Id.   Finally, the new provisions of the Act\n\nrequire the President to submit to Congress, on an annual basis,\n\na report including “the annual rate of early termination of\n\nvolunteers, including demographic data associated with such\n\nearly termination.”     Id. § 2507i.\n\n\n     Plaintiff argues that this legislation demonstrates the\n\npublic interest in “the safety and well-being of the Volunteers,\n\n[which] depend[s], in large part, on the effectiveness of and\n\nprofessionalism of the Peace Corps staff.”      Opp’n at 19.   The\n\n\n\n                                   20\n \n\fgovernment, for its part, does not acknowledge the Kate Puzey\n\nPeace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011.    Rather, it claims\n\nthat the information in the staff ratings data would not\n\ncontribute to the public’s understanding of the Peace Corps’\n\noperations or activities.   Reply at 15.   Even if there is public\n\ninterest in the information, the government claims that interest\n\nis satisfied by the disclosure of the information aggregated at\n\nthe global or regional level.    Id. at 13-14.\n\n\n     Upon consideration, the Court concludes that there is a\n\nsignificant public interest in disclosure of the responses to\n\nquestions regarding staff performance.     The 2011 Amendments to\n\nthe Peace Corps Act make clear that the Agency’s mission\n\nincludes protecting the safety and security of the Volunteers,\n\nas well as ensuring that Peace Corps personnel are effectively\n\nmanaging the agency’s operations at a country by country level.\n\nThese are precisely the concerns addressed in the AVS questions\n\nrelating to staff performance:   Volunteer access to health care,\n\nsupport from staff in substantive areas including safety and\n\nsecurity, and staff awareness of and responsiveness to\n\nVolunteers’ concerns.

Disclosure of this information would therefore\n\nserve the very public interest central to the purposes of FOIA\n\nby furthering the right of the public to know “what their\n\n\n\n                                 21\n \n\fgovernment is up to.” United States Dep’t of Justice v.\n\nReporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112224\"><a href=\"/opinion/112224/us-dept-of-justice-v-reporters-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 773 (1989).\n\n\n     The Court further concludes that there is a significant\n\npublic interest disclosure of this information on a country-by-\n\ncountry basis.   As plaintiff explains, Volunteers are invited to\n\nserve in specific countries, where they are overseen by a Peace\n\nCorps Country Director “who is the executive leader of the Peace\n\nCorps for that country.”   Opp’n at 11.   Moreover, plaintiff\n\ncontends, it was the “safety of Volunteers, and the inadequate\n\nsupport some victims of violence received from the Peace Corps\n\nand the host country in which they serve,” which prompted the\n\nmedia attention that led to the Volunteer Protection Act of\n\n2011. Id. at 18.   Finally, as set forth above, Congress has\n\nrecognized the importance of having access to this information\n\non a country by country basis. See 22 U.S.C. § 2507e(e).     By\n\ncontrast, Plaintiff has not produced any support for his claim\n\nthat there is public interest in program-by-program survey\n\nresults within each country.   The Court therefore cannot\n\nconclude that the program-by-program data is relevant to the\n\npublic’s ability to monitor whether the agency is correctly\n\ndoing its job.\n\n\n     Through the new reporting requirements, the amendments to\n\nthe Act provide that much of the information plaintiff seeks\n\n\n                                22\n \n\fwill be publically available in future years.    However, the\n\ninformation obtained in the 2009 and 2010 AVS predates the new\n\nrequirements.   Accordingly, without the data from the AVS, the\n\npublic would have more difficulty determining whether the Peace\n\nCorps has been, and is, carrying out its mission to protect and\n\nsupport its Volunteers.

Cir. 2008) (finding a\n\nstrong public interest in disclosing data the Department of\n\nAgriculture collects to monitor its program administration).\n\n\n     Having found greater than a de minimis privacy interest and\n\na significant public interest in disclosure of the country-by-\n\ncountry staff rating questions in the AVS, the Court must now\n\n“balance the two to determine whether the agency has met its\n\nburden to show that the substantial interest in personal privacy\n\nis not outweighed by the public interest in disclosure. . .\n\n[U]nless the invasion of privacy is ‘clearly unwarranted,’ the\n\npublic interest in disclosure must prevail and the agency may\n\nnot withhold the files under Exemption 6.”     Id., 515 F.3d at\n\n1232 (citations omitted).\n\n\n     In this case, the Peace Corps’ employees’ privacy interests\n\nare modest.   As set forth above, plaintiff seeks survey\n\nresponses to multiple choice questions regarding Volunteer\n\nexperience with staff performance.     The survey responses are not\n\n\n                                  23\n \n\fofficial performance reviews or ratings, nor do they contain\n\nnames or any other personal details regarding any staff members.\n\nBy contrast, there is a strong public interest in monitoring the\n\nPeace Corps’ protection of Volunteers’ safety and security,\n\nwhich must necessarily include effective management within each\n\ncountry.                     Accordingly, release of this information would not\n\n“constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy”\n\nunder Exemption 6.\n\n\n                      D. Exemption 5\n\n\n              Exemption 5 allows an agency to withhold “inter-agency or\n\nintra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available\n\nby law to a party . . . in litigation with the agency.”                                           5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(6).                                            Citing Exemption 5’s deliberative process\n\nprivilege, the Peace Corps has withheld responses to all of the\n\nAVS questions also withheld under Exemption 6, as well as\n\nresponses to all or part of three additional questions.\n\n\n              First, the Peace Corps withheld the response to question F1\n\n(2009 and 2010 AVS), which are identical in both surveys.4                                            It\n\nasks volunteers how prepared the host country people were for\n\ntheir arrival when they first arrived at their host community,\n                                                            \n4\n  Unless otherwise noted, the Court takes all facts regarding the\nquestions and withheld responses from the Defendant’s Motion,\nExhibit 10 (Table of Withheld Responses); Exhibit 1 (2009 AVS),\nExhibit 2 (2010 AVS), and Exhibit 14 (Vaughn index), as well as\nPlaintiff’s Opposition, Exhibit 1 (Chart of Withheld Responses).                                            \n\n                                                                         24\n \n\fand permits responses of “not at all,” “minimally/poorly,”\n\n“adequately,” “considerably/well” and “exceptionally/very well.”\n\n\n     Responses to question J1 (2009 and 2010 AVS), also\n\nidentical in both surveys, were partially withheld.    The\n\nquestion asks how personally rewarding Volunteers found their\n\nPeace Corps service, and provides five separate categories for\n\n“Overall Peace Corps Service,” “Community Involvement,”\n\n“Experience with Other Volunteers,” “Work with\n\nCounterparts/Community Partner,” and “Experience with other Host\n\nCountry Nationals/Individuals.”    Volunteers could respond “not\n\nat all,” “minimally,” “adequately,” “considerably,” and\n\n“exceptionally.”   Of the five categories, the Peace Corps\n\nwithheld responses as to one:   work with counterparts/community\n\npartner.\n\n\n     Finally, the Peace Corps withheld the responses to\n\nidentical questions F6 (2009 AVS) and F5 (2010 AVS).   These\n\nquestions ask Volunteers whether their host country would\n\nbenefit the most if the Peace Corps program was discontinued,\n\nreduced, refocused/redesigned, maintained as it, or expanded.\n\nVolunteers could choose one of these options.\n\n\n     The deliberative process privilege “covers documents\n\nreflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberation\n\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and\n\n                                  25\n \n\fpolicies are formulated.”   Dep’t of the Interior v.

A document is predecisional if it was\n\ngenerated before the agency action was finally adopted, and\n\ndeliberative if it “reflects the give-and-take of the\n\nconsultative process.”   Id. at 874 (citation omitted).\n\n\n     The Peace Corps asserts that each of the survey responses\n\nwithheld is predecisional because (1) Peace Corps officials rely\n\nheavily on these responses in the continuing process of\n\nformulating agency strategies and policies; and (2) the surveys\n\nthemselves state that they will “be used by the Peace Corps to\n\nidentify best practices and implement program improvements” and\n\n“will contribut[e] to the improvement of the Peace Corps’\n\noperations and, ultimately, to the success of the Peace Corps.”\n\nDef.’s Mot. at 38-39, see also Declaration of Alice-Lynn Ryssman\n\nat ¶¶ 10-13.

Indeed,\n\nvirtually any action or information considered by the Peace\n\nCorps conceivably could fit within this definition and thus be\n\nwithheld from public disclosure.”   Opp’n at 27.\n\n\n     The Court agrees with plaintiff.   Although the government\n\nneed not pinpoint a specific decision or policy in connection\n\nwith which predecisional material is prepared, the deliberative\n\nprocess must be capable of some definition.

The Circuit rejected the argument, finding that the\n\nagency could not classify its ongoing, continual task of\n\nappraising, evaluating and making recommendations for\n\nimprovement as a seamless “process” for the purposes of the\n\ndeliberative process privilege, since such a definition places\n\nvirtually no limit on the privilege.     Id. at 1145.   To allow\n\nsuch an expansive definition of the term process under Exemption\n\n5, the Court reasoned, “would swallow up a substantial part of\n\nthe administrative process, and virtually foreclose all public\n\nknowledge regarding the implementation of . . . policies in any\n\ngiven agency.”     Id.\n\n\n        Defendant’s arguments fail for the same reason as the\n\ngovernment’s did in Vaughn.     The Peace Corps asserts generally\n\nthat the AVS surveys are part of the agency’s processes for\n\nongoing, continuous appraisals and improvements in all manner of\n\nagency activities, from strategic planning, to program\n\nimprovement, to assessment of agency performance and beyond.\n\nRyssman Decl. ¶¶ 10-13; Benjamin Decl. ¶¶ 10-13.    To permit the\n\nDefendant to assert the deliberative process privilege for every\n\npiece of information which could be used, in some way or\n\n\n\n                                  28\n \n\fanother, in the continuous process of improving the Agency would\n\nset virtually no limit on the privilege.    Exemption 5’s\n\nprotections do not reach nearly this far.\n\n\n     Further contradicting the Peace Corps’ stated rationale for\n\nwithholding under Exemption 5 is the fact that the agency\n\nproduced most of the responses to the surveys.   The Court is\n\nparticularly puzzled by this because the Agency asserts that the\n\nentire AVS results are used to shape agency policy and\n\ndecisionmaking.   See Ryssman Decl. ¶¶ 10-13, Benjamin Decl. ¶¶\n\n10-13.   The Agency offers no explanation as to why the withheld\n\ninformation constitutes pre-decisional deliberations connected\n\nto an agency policy or action, while the other responses in the\n\nsame documents are not.   In order to show that material is\n\ndeliberative, the agency must identify “what deliberative\n\nprocess is involved and the role played by the documents at\n\nissue in the course of that process.”   Coastal States Gas Corp.\n\nv.

Accordingly, the Court\n\nfinds the agency has not met its burden to demonstrate that the\n\nwithheld materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative, and\n\ntherefore that the documents are not properly withheld under\n\nExemption 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                29\n \n\f          E.
