The word8 are not capable of exact deflnltlon.\nThey are relative and will depend on the fact8 and clr-\ncum8tances of Individual ca8e8.          In that regard, the\n\fHon. Wm. J-Murray, Page 8    (v-881)\n\n\ncourts have uniformly held that the Commlsslon is to pass\nupon Issues of fact.\n           In Brown v. Rumble 011 & Refining Co., 126 Tex.\n296, 83 S.W.2d 935 (19351        I    1 dl        d the\nCourt held that the rule ~~~t\"~~b~lvl~~~~~ea~pliea\n\"where rule 37 Is In force In a certain terrltorg.*       As\nused, the words \"certain territory\"    could only mean a\nterritory  productive of oil or gas.    In Shell Petroleum\nCorporation v. Railroad Commlsslon, It was held the sub-\naprior                                      to the discovery\nof oil and gas In the territory    where the lands are lo-\ncated.'\n           Writing on the Jktlon fol;' Rehearing In the\nShell Case above, Justice Baugh stated that he agreed\nthat the subdlvlslon rule \"should not and does not ap-\nply to Instances where one In good.fi+lth acquires fee\ntitle to gland In                     :    It iB comnon\n]oloWledRe that a                       ry\" Is proven to be\nproductive of 011 or gas only by tk &i&g-In          of a\ndiscovery well.   What territory is \"proven\" and which\nla \"reasonably productive of oil or gas. Is a question\nof fact depending on the circumstances of each case.\n           It may be argued that certain language In Gulf\nLand Co. v. Atlantic Refining Co., 134 Tex. 59, 131m\n26 73 (1939) I 1ays down the proposition   that no eub-\ndlvl~lon of land-made aubseqtient to 1919 can be con-\nridered under any clrcunstances In granting an exception\nto Rule 37 to prevent conf.lscatlon.    We would not be In\naccord with that argument. In that case the Commlsslon\ngranted a permit to drill a well on a 2.35acre      tract\nwhich had been senrenated from a 6.88-acre tract.      The\nsegregation was tide-after   the discovery of oil In Rast\nTexas where the land WaB located.     The Co8wilasfon grant-\ned the permit as an exception to the rule on the ground\nthat It would prevent the confiscation    of property.    The\nSupreme MU&i said:\n            \"An examlnatlon of the order or rule of\n     Ray 29, 1934, hereinafter referred to as the\n     rule of May 29th. will show that subdlvl8lons\n     of land, as such, which have or hereafter may\n     come into existence after rule 37 became ef-\n     fective,   are not protected at all against\n     confiscation.    Whenrule 37 and the rule of\n     May 29th are read together, It Is evident\n     that exception permits may be Issued to pro-\n     tect such tracts from waste; but such exception\n\fEon. Wm. J. Murray, Page 9         (V-881)\n\n\n        permits cannot be Issued to protect    such\n        tracts, as such, from conflacatlon.R\n          The court then quoted a rectlon from the rule\nof May 29th and~sald:  ?To our minds, language could not\nbe made plainer, or more all-1nc1ua1ve.\"  F~llowlng that\nstatement, the court said on page 83 of the oplnlont\n               'Under such a record, there Is no pos-\n        sible escape from the conclusion that, a8 a\n        matter of law, the Commission violated Its\n        rule of May 29th In granting this well permit\n        to prevent a confiscation     of property.

Corp. v. Railroad Commission; Nash 8.\nShell Pet. Corp.; Shell Pet. Corp. v. Railroad Commleslon\nof Texas; and Yencker v. Railroad Caaai8slon of Texas.\n‘ptie wencker   cade was decided    after the eeclelonin the\nOulf Land Companycase.    The Wencker decision, by citing\n%he three previous Court of Civil Appeals decisions In\nall of which writ of error was di8ni88ed, drew into line\nauthprlty for the rule that where a tract of land Is sub-\ndlvlrled for purpose8 other than the development of oil\nand gas prior to the discovery of oil In the area or ter-\nritory where the lands are located, euch eltuatlon does\nnot create a violation of Rule 37 80 as to prevent the\ngranting of a permit to prevent confiscation.\n              The facts In the Oulf Land case and the facts\nIn all four of the Court of Cl 11 Appeals cases cited are\ndifferent.      In the Ml? Land czse the 2.35 acre tract\nwas subdivided after oil was dlsc&ered        and after Rule\n 7 became effe&ive as to that field and as to that land.\n    th     th          the aubdivislone were made\n Ee df8~ov~~yc%%l.         ?'t&s*$;t  difference\n ingulshes the cases.

Consequently, the rules announced In\n      that case should not be Interpreted as laying dam such\n      an inilexlble   rule that any subdivision made subsequent\n      to 1919 is an absolute bar to the granting OS an trctp-\n      tlon to Rule 37 to prevent conflsaatlon.      To do so, we\n      believe, would place an unreasonable aonstruotlon upon\n      that opinion and would also be out of harmony with the\n      languaie used by Rr.

We would not be In\naccord with that argument. In that case the Commlsslon\ngranted a permit to drill a well on a 2.35acre      tract\nwhich had been senrenated from a 6.88-acre tract.      The\nsegregation was tide-after   the discovery of oil In Rast\nTexas where the land WaB located.     The Co8wilasfon grant-\ned the permit as an exception to the rule on the ground\nthat It would prevent the confiscation    of property.    The\nSupreme MU&i said:\n            \"An examlnatlon of the order or rule of\n     Ray 29, 1934, hereinafter referred to as the\n     rule of May 29th. will show that subdlvl8lons\n     of land, as such, which have or hereafter may\n     come into existence after rule 37 became ef-\n     fective,   are not protected at all against\n     confiscation.
