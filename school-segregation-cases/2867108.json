Seman, on his age discrimination claim against his\n\nformer employer, appellant United States Cement Company (\"U.S.\n\nCement\"), pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(ADEA), 29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a).0    The trial jury found that Seman's\n\nage was a determining factor in U.S. Cement's decision to\n\nterminate his employment; that Seman would have been employed by\n\nU.S. Cement's successor company had Seman's age not been a factor\n\n0\n    29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a) in pertinent part provides:\n\n           It shall be unlawful for an employer--\n                (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n                individual or otherwise discriminate against any\n                individual with respect to his compensation,\n                terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n                because of such individual's age;\n                (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n                in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n                any individual of employment opportunities or\n                otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n                employee, because of such individual's age . . ..\n\fin the termination decision, and that Seman was entitled to\n\nbackpay amounting to $150,000 -- $10,000 more than Seman's\n\ncounsel had requested at trial.\n\n     On appeal, U.S. Cement assigns six points of error: (1) the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying U.S. Cement's motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a); (2) the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying U.S. Cement's\n\nmotion for a new trial on the ground that the jury verdict was\n\nexcessive and the result of passion, prejudice or caprice; (3)\n\nthe district court erred in not reducing the verdict to the\n\n$140,000 amount requested by Seman in backpay; (4) the district\n\ncourt erred in instructing the jury concerning the appropriate\n\nburden of proof; (5) the district court erred in instructing the\n\njury that it could consider whether Seman's employment would have\n\ncontinued with U.S. Cement's successor company in calculating\n\nU.S. Cement's liability for Seman's back pay; and (6) the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing U.S. Cement's request for\n\nremitter of federal income taxes on Seman's backpay award.\n\n     We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291 to review\n\nthe final amended order of the district court entered on\n\nSeptember 23, 1993.   We hold that the district court did not err\n\nin denying U.S. Cement's Rule 50(a) motion, and that the case was\n\nproperly submitted to the jury.   We also hold, however, that the\n\ndistrict court erred in its instruction to the jury.\n\n     The need to consider the merits of U.S. Cement's remaining\n\narguments is therefore obviated by our determination that the\n\nerroneous jury instruction requires reversal of the final amended\n\fjudgment entered by the district court on September 23, 1993 in\n\nfavor of Seman and against U.S. Cement in the amount of\n\n$167,827.83, including prejudgment interest.    We thus leave the\n\nremaining issues raised on this appeal by U.S. Cement for\n\ndetermination in the first instance by the district court on\n\nretrial.   Indeed, at oral argument counsel urged that we consider\n\nissues relating to backpay only if we were not persuaded that the\n\nerroneous jury instruction required reversal.\n\n     We, therefore, will reverse the September 23, 1993 final\n\namended judgment, and will remand for a new trial on Seman's ADEA\n\nclaim against U.S. Cement.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n     Seman was hired by SME Bessemer Cement Company in April 1983\n\nas a cement salesman.   He retained that position when SME\n\nBessemer was purchased in April 1987 by its wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary, U.S. Cement.     Between April 1983 and January 1988,\n\nSeman was assigned to handle primarily cement field sales in\n\nsouthwestern Pennsylvania.    In January 1988, Seman was promoted\n\nto the newly-created position of assistant sales manager for U.S.\n\nCement, and worked briefly out of an office at U.S. Cement's\n\nplant office in Lowellville, Ohio.     Although U.S. Cement\n\nexecutives later testified that the assistant sales manager\n\nposition was never intended to be a permanent position, no one\n\napparently mentioned that fact to Seman.\n\n     Shortly after turning 65 on May 3, 1988, Seman was asked\n\nabout his plans for retirement by Arthur Edwards, U.S. Cement's\n\fvice president of sales.     Seman informed Edwards that he did not\n\nintend to retire for at least several years.    Within a month of\n\nthat discussion, Seman's position as assistant sales manager was\n\neliminated, and Seman was ordered back to the field without any\n\nchange in pay or benefits.    At that time, U.S. Cement had five\n\ncement salesmen:    Seman; Robert McDonough, 54; Frank Long, 41;\n\nLee Lydic, 33; and Kurt Rosander, 31.    At 65, Seman was by far\n\nthe oldest member of the cement sales force.\n\n       In September 1988, just a few months after being sent back\n\nto the field, Seman was informed by Edwards that U.S. Cement was\n\nreducing its sales force, and that the company had decided to lay\n\noff Seman and McDonough.     Seman requested reconsideration of that\n\ndecision, and suggested to Edwards that U.S. Cement's selection\n\nof its two oldest salesmen as casualties of the reduction in\n\nforce decision could be viewed as age discrimination.    Seman also\n\nthreatened to communicate with the Equal Employment Opportunities\n\nCommission (\"EEOC\") concerning the threatened layoffs.\n\nUltimately, U.S. Cement decided to retain McDonough, and to\n\nterminate Long, 41, along with Seman.\n\n       Effective October 31, 1988, Seman and Long were laid off\n\nfrom their positions as field salesmen.    Long was rehired that\n\nsame day by U.S. Cement and given another position at no loss of\n\npay.    Seman, however, was never offered reemployment in any\n\ncapacity by U.S. Cement.\n\n       On August 29, 1990, Seman commenced this action in the\n\ndistrict court, alleging a violation of the ADEA.    At trial on\n\nhis claim against U.S. Cement, Seman introduced evidence showing\n\fthat, after being approached about his plans for retirement, he\n\nwas laid off from a job for which he was qualified while younger\n\nand less-experienced salesmen were retained by U.S. Cement to\n\nperform essentially the same duties he had performed before his\n\nemployment was terminated.    The evidence also showed that all of\n\nU.S. Cement's sales people -- except for Lydic, who voluntarily\n\nleft to work for a competitor -- were retained after U.S. Cement\n\nwas acquired by ESSROC Materials, Inc. in August 1990.    For its\n\npart, U.S. Cement presented evidence to support its position that\n\nthe decision to terminate Seman's employment was based solely on\n\nlegitimate nondiscriminatory business reasons, and was not in any\n\nway motivated by Seman's age.\n\n     Following the introduction of all of the evidence, U.S.\n\nCement moved for entry of judgment as a matter of law pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).0   That motion was denied by the district\n\ncourt judge, who then submitted the case to the jury on special\n\ninterrogatories after instructing the panel on the law.   The jury\n\nwas asked to determine:\n     (1) Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that\n     plaintiff's age was a determining factor in defendant's\n     decision to terminate plaintiff's employment? [The jury\n     answered,] Yes;\n\n0\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1) provides:\n\n               If during a trial by jury a party has been fully\n          heard with respect to an issue and there is no legally\n          sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to\n          have found for that party with respect to that issue,\n          the court may grant a motion for judgment was a matter\n          of law against that party on any claim, counterclaim,\n          cross-claim, or third party claim that cannot under the\n          controlling law be maintained without a favorable\n          finding on that issue.\n\f     (2) Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that\n     plaintiff would have been employed by ESSROC after it\n     acquired, on February 27, 1990, United States Cement\n     facility at which plaintiff was formerly employed if\n     plaintiff's age had not been a factor in defendant's\n     decision to terminate plaintiff's employment? [The jury\n     answered,] Yes;\n\n     (3) To what amount of back pay is plaintiff entitled?      [The\n     jury answered,] $150,000.\n\n\nApp. 553.\n\n     A judgment in favor of Seman and against U.S. Cement was\n\nthen entered in the amount of $150,000.    U.S. Cement filed this\n\nappeal after its motion for a new trial was denied and the\n\ndistrict court entered a final order amending judgment in favor\n\nof Seman to include prejudgment interest.0\n\n\n\n                               II.\n\n     We exercise plenary review of an order granting or denying a\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law and apply the same\n\nstandard as the district court.   Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco\n\nCorp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993).     In an ADEA disparate\ntreatment case, our standard requires consideration of whether or\n\nnot there is substantial evidence in the record to support an\n\n0\n   U.S. Cement had filed an earlier notice of appeal of the\ndistrict court's February 8, 1993 order denying U.S. Cement's\nmotion for a new trial. At that time, Seman's motion for award\nof prejudgment interest was still pending before the district\ncourt. This court on May 10, 1993 dismissed U.S. Cement's earlier\nappeal without prejudice to U.S. Cement's ability to file a new\nnotice of appeal once the district court ruled on the prejudgment\ninterest motion. The district court's final order, entered on\nSeptember 23, 1993, awarded Seman $17,827.08 in prejudgment\ninterest and accordingly amended the judgment to $167,827.83\n[sic]. App. 559.\n\femployee's contention that \"'but for' his age he would not have\n\nbeen discharged.\"    Billet v. Cigna Corp., 940 F.2d 812, 815 (3d\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n      The ADEA prohibits discrimination in employment against an\n\nindividual over age 40 because of that individual's age.   29\n\nU.S.C. 623(a)(1).0   To recover in an ADEA action, a discharged\n\nemployee over the age of 40 must first establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of age\n\ndiscrimination.   For employees such as Seman who are not replaced\n\nbecause their jobs are eliminated, a prima facie case of age\n\ndiscrimination requires only a showing that the discharged\n\nemployee was at least forty years of age when his employment was\n\nterminated, and that he was laid off from a job for which he was\n\nqualified while other workers not in the protected class were\n\nretained.   Billet, 940 F.2d at 816 n.3; Turner v. Schering-Plough\n\nCorp., 901 F.2d 335, 342 (3d Cir. 1990).\n\n      At trial, Seman presented a prima facie case from which an\n\ninference of age discrimination could be drawn.   The\n\nuncontroverted evidence was that, shortly after turning 65 and\n\ninforming the company that he had no plans to retire, Seman was\n\nlaid off while younger employees were retained.   The evidence\n\nalso indicated that Seman was qualified for the position; that\n\nU.S. Cement abandoned its original plan to lay off its two oldest\n\nsalesman (Seman, 65, and McDonough, 54) after Seman raised the\n\nspecter of an age discrimination complaint; and that the company\n\n\n0\n    See supra note 1.\n\finstead laid off Long, 41, along with Seman, on October 31, 1988.\n\nIn addition, the parties stipulated that U.S. Cement rehired Long\n\non October 31, 1988 for a different position at no loss of pay,\n\nand that all of the salesmen whose positions were not eliminated\n\nas part of the purported reduction in force decision were far\n\nyounger than Seman.   In short, only the 65-year-old Seman lost\n\nhis job.\n\n     U.S. Cement apparently does not dispute that Seman\n\nestablished a prima facie case of age discrimination.     Rather,\n\nU.S. Cement contends on appeal0 that Seman failed to meet his\n\nburden of proving that U.S. Cement's proffered nondiscriminatory\n\nbusiness explanation for Seman's termination, a reduction in\n\nforce, was a mere pretext for discrimination and not worthy of\n\ncredence, and that the district court thus erred in not granting\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n0\n   The record reveals that U.S. Cement's motion for judgment\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) stated no more than the\nfollowing:\n\n          MR. LUCIDI [Counsel for U.S. Cement]: For the record,\n     I'd like to make a motion for judgment as a matter of law\n     under Rule 50 (a) on the basis that plaintiff has failed to\n     meet his ultimate burden to establish that age was the\n     determinative factor in the decision to terminate\n     plaintiff's employment.\n\n          THE COURT: Well, I think that this is a jury question\n     and I'm going to overrule the motion.\n\nApp. 504-05.\n\f     In a pretext case such as this one,0 we follow the\n\nevidentiary procedure set forth by the Supreme Court in McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), subsequently refined\n\nin Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248\n\n(1981), and recently clarified in St. Mary's Honor Center v.\n\nHicks,     U.S.     , 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993).0   As now explained\n\nin Hicks,0 the McDonnell Douglas scheme provides that, once the\n\nemployee establishes a prima facie case creating a presumption of\n\nunlawful discrimination, the burden of production shifts to the\n\nemployer to provide a legitimate nondiscriminatory explanation\n\nfor the employer's adverse employment action.    If the employer\n\nmeets this burden of production, then the presumption of\n\ndiscriminatory intent created by the employee's prima facie case\n\nis rebutted and the presumption simply \"drops out of the\n\n0\n   In Griffiths v. CIGNA Corp., 988 F.2d 457 (3d Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 114 S. Ct. 186 (1993), we drew a distinction between\n\"pretext\" cases (i.e., where the employee argues that the\nfacially legitimate reason asserted by the employer for its\nemployment decision was false) and \"mixed motive\" cases (i.e.,\nwhere the employee does not contend that the nondiscriminatory\nmotives articulated by the employer did not motivate the\nemployment decision, but rather that additional, improper motives\nplayed a role in causing that decision). Id. at 468-470.     Here,\nSeman has challenged all of the nondiscriminatory reasons\narticulated by U.S. Cement as pretextual, and has not presented\nany direct evidence that can fairly be said to prove a mixed\nmotive case. This case therefore is properly characterized as a\npretext, and not a \"mixed motive,\" case.\n0\n   McDonnell Douglas and Hicks (race discrimination) and Burdine\n(gender discrimination) are Title VII cases. Although the ADEA\nwas enacted by Congress as a separate statute and is not part of\nTitle VII, we nevertheless apply the McDonnell Douglas procedural\nframework within the ADEA context. See, e.g., Geary v.\nVisitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish School, 7 F.3d 324,\n329 n.4 (3d Cir. 1993) (ADEA case).\n0\n   See discussion infra section III, B.\n\fpicture.\"    Hicks, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.   The employee \"at all times\n\nbears the 'ultimate burden of persuasion.'\"     Id. (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n     In the instant case, Seman established a prima facie case\n\nand U.S. Cement in response came forward with a nondiscriminatory\n\nbusiness reason for the company's decision to terminate Seman's\n\nemployment.    According to the testimony of U.S. Cement's chief\n\noperating officer, Michael Carlow, and its vice president of\n\nsales, Edwards, the company determined in 1988 that it was\n\nnecessary to reduce the sales force because of production\n\nproblems creating a shortage of cement to satisfy current\n\ncontracts.    Edwards and Carlow insisted that Seman was selected\n\nfor termination not because of his age, but because Seman lacked\n\nbroad sales experience and the flexibility necessary to handle\n\nthe type of future sales envisaged by U.S. Cement.\n\n     Having proffered a legitimate nondiscriminatory explanation\n\nfor its decision, U.S. Cement satisfied its burden of production.\n\nConsequently, the McDonnell Douglas framework -- with its\n\npresumptions and shifting burdens -- was no longer relevant.\n\nHicks, 113 S. Ct. at 2749.    Hicks teaches, though, that rejection\n\nof the employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason will permit\n\nthe trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional\n\ndiscrimination, so long as there is a finding of discrimination.0\n\n0\n   Rejection of the employer's proffered reasons, without a\nfinding of discrimination, is insufficient to warrant judgment\nfor the employee. The employee \"at all times bears the 'ultimate\nburden of persuasion,'\" and any presumption created by the\nemployee's establishment of a prima facie case \"does not shift\nthe burden of proof\" to the employer. Hicks, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.\n\fId. at 2749 n.4.    In other words, \"[t]he factfinder's disbelief\n\nof the reasons put forward by the [employer] . . . may, together\n\nwith the elements of the [employee's] prima facie case, suffice\n\nto show intentional discrimination.\"   Id.\n\n     Here, Seman's proofs had cast doubt on U.S. Cement's\n\nfacially legitimate explanation for its adverse employment\n\ndecision.   That evidence indicated that the younger and less-\n\nexperienced salesmen retained by U.S. Cement were making calls at\n\nhouse accounts and soliciting new business in Seman's former\n\nsales territory after Seman was let go.   That evidence could have\n\nled the jury to disbelieve the nondiscriminatory explanation\n\noffered by U.S. Cement that layoffs were necessary because the\n\ncompany was committed to selling what limited cement was\n\navailable to house accounts handled only by Edwards and Carlow,\n\nand not by salesmen.\n\n     Seman also introduced evidence indicating that he had more\n\nexperience in the cement industry than the younger salesmen\n\nretained by U.S. Cement, and was more qualified than some of the\n\nyounger salesmen.   That evidence also could have been weighed by\n\nthe jury in rejecting U.S. Cement's explanation that it had\n\nretained the other salesmen instead of Seman because they had\n\nsuperior sales skills.   So, too, could the jury have weighed in\n\nSeman's favor the testimony of Carlow and Edwards that they had\n\nnever criticized Seman's job performance.\n\f     The jury could consider all of that evidence in evaluating\n\nthe merit, or lack thereof, of U.S. Cement's explanations for\n\nSeman's termination.   That evidence created factual issues\n\nrequiring a credibility assessment by the trier of the fact\n\nbefore a final determination could be made as to whether Seman\n\nhad proved his claim that U.S. Cement intentionally discriminated\n\nagainst him on the basis of age, in violation of the ADEA.\n\nJudgment as a matter of law in favor of U.S. Cement was\n\ninappropriate because Seman had established a prima facie case of\n\nage discrimination and had presented substantial evidence\n\ncreating a factual dispute concerning U.S. Cement's facially\n\nlegitimate business reasons.0\n\n     We hold therefore that the district court did not err in\n\ndenying U.S. Cement's Rule 50(a)(1) motion.   See Hicks, 113 S.\n\nCt. at 2748.\n\n\n\n\n0\n   Our reading of the record satisfies us that, had the teachings\nof St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749\n(rejection of employer's proffered reasons, without finding of\ndiscrimination, is insufficient to warrant judgment for the\nemployee), been known to counsel and the court at the time that\nU.S. Cement made its Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter\nof law, the evidence adduced at trial would have still compelled\nthe district court to submit the case to the jury.\n\f                              III.\n\n     Even though we affirm the Rule 50(a) decision of the\n\ndistrict court, the charge then given by the district court to\n\nthe jury was incorrect in that it effectively limited the jurors'\n\nfinding to one aspect of the case -- Seman's prima facie case. In\n\nrelevant part, the jury was instructed:\n          Plaintiff in this case claims that defendant used age\n     as a determining factor in making the decision to terminate\n     his employment.\n\n          When a plaintiff brings suit under the Act, the burden\n     of proof is on the plaintiff to prove his claim against the\n     defendant. In order to prevail on his claim, a plaintiff\n     must prove each of the following facts by the preponderance\n     of the evidence:\n\n          First, plaintiff must prove that he was within the\n     protected age group; that is, over the age of 40. I charge\n     you as a matter of law that plaintiff was within the\n     protected age group.\n\n          Second, plaintiff must prove that defendant took action\n     that adversely affected plaintiff's employment situation,\n     specifically that he was terminated from his employment with\n     defendant on October 30, 1988. Excuse me, October 31, 1988.\n\n          It is not disputed that plaintiff's employment was\n     terminated on October 31, 1988.\n\n          Third, plaintiff must prove that he was qualified for\n     the job from which he was terminated.\n\n          Fourth, plaintiff must prove that his age was a\n     determining factor in the actions taken by defendant.\n\n          To meet his burden of proof of proving that his age was\n     a determining factor, plaintiff must prove that he would not\n     have been denied the employment opportunities but for his\n     age. But for does not require that plaintiff prove that his\n     age was the sole or exclusive factor motivating defendant,\n     only that age made a difference in the employer's decision.\n     He must prove that defendant would not have terminated his\n     employment if plaintiff's age had not been taken into\n     account in deciding this matter.\n\f     The Act requires that an employer reach employment\ndecisions without regard to age, but it does not place an\naffirmative duty upon an employer to accord special\ntreatment to members of the protected group.\n\n     You must remember that the issue you are to decide is\nwhether age is the determining factor in the defendant's\ndecision. The issue is not whether defendant's reasons for\nplaintiff's termination were based on good cause or sound\nmanagement decisions. You are not to judge whether\ndefendant's decision was right or wrong from a business\nstandpoint. Rather, you are to decide whether age was a\ndetermining factor underlying defendant's decision. In\nshort, you are not to decide whether you agree or disagree\nwith defendant's actions, only whether age was a determining\nfactor.\n\n     In summary, to prevail on a claim of violation of the\nAct, plaintiff has the burden of persuading you by the fair\npreponderance of the evidence that he was more than 40 years\nold, that he was qualified, and that age was a determining\nfactor in the decision of defendant's to terminate his\nemployment. Age is a determining factor if plaintiff would\nnot have received the same treatment but for his age.\n\n     Concerning the claim made by plaintiff under the Act,\ndefendant denies that age was a determining factor in its\ndecision to terminate his employment. Defendant states that\nthis decision was made for legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nbusiness reasons unrelated to his age.\n\n     If you find defendant's decision with respect to\nplaintiff was made for business reasons among which age was\nnot a determining factor, there can be no violation of the\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act, and you must return a\nverdict for the defendant. However, if you find that\nplaintiff's age was a determining factor in the decision to\nterminate plaintiff's employment, you must return a verdict\nfor plaintiff, and you will award damages for that\ndiscrimination as I will instruct you.\n\n     In connection with plaintiff's age discrimination\nclaim, there was testimony that plaintiff's position was\neliminated for economic reasons as part of a reduction of\nforce -- in force.\n\n     One method by which an employee in a reduction in force\ncase can prove that age was a determining factor in his\ndischarge is to show that younger employees were treated\nmore favorably in the reduction in force. Such proof may\n\f     consist of evidence that younger employees were not\n     terminated whereas the older employees were terminated, or\n     that work, which was formerly performed by the older\n     employees was not reassigned or delegated to younger\n     employees who were not terminated. In these circumstances,\n     you may find age to have been a determining factor in the\n     decision to terminate such an older employee.\n\n          It is not necessary that the younger employees\n     themselves be outside the protected age class under the Act;\n     that is, it is not necessary that the younger employees be\n     less than 40 years old. The law requires only that the age\n     difference between the terminated employees and the younger\n     employees, together with other evidence of discriminatory\n     intent, be sufficient to prove to you, by a preponderance of\n     the evidence, that age was a determining factor in the\n     discharge of such an employee.\n\nApp. 534-538 (emphasis added).\n\n\n     U.S. Cement assigns error to the above-highlighted portion\n\nof the jury instruction.   Specifically, U.S. Cement contends that\n\nthe district court's language relating to the prima facie case in\n\na reduction in force case could have misled jurors to believe\n\nthat they were required to return a verdict in favor of Seman and\n\nagainst U.S. Cement solely because younger employees were not\n\nterminated.\n\n\n                                 A.\n\n     Seman contended before us at oral argument that U.S. Cement,\n\nby not raising a timely objection at the trial level, had waived\n\nits right to appellate review of this issue.   Under Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 51,\n     No party may assign   as error the giving or the failure to\n     give an instruction   unless that party objects thereto before\n     the jury retires to   consider its verdict, stating distinctly\n     the matter objected   to and the grounds of the objection.\n\f     The question of whether U.S. Cement timely and specifically\n\nobjected to the jury charge is critical to our determination of\n\nthe appropriate standard of review.   See United States v. Simon,\n\n995 F.2d 1236, 1242 n. 8 (3d Cir. 1993); United States v. Gibbs,\n\n739 F.2d 838, 849 (3d Cir. 1984) (en banc) (holding that this\n\ncourt will not entertain arguments on appeal based on objections\n\nnot timely raised below unless they constitute plain error),\n\ncert. denied, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985).   If a timely objection did\n\npreserve the issue for appeal, our standard of review on the\n\nissue of whether the jury charge as a whole stated the correct\n\nlegal standard would be plenary.   Griffiths v. CIGNA Corp., 988\n\nF.2d 457, 462 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 186 (1993).     If\n\nthe issue had not been preserved through a timely objection at\n\ntrial, the \"plain error\" standard would apply.   Gibbs, 739 F.2d\n\nat 850 n.25.\n\n     We have reviewed the record and conclude that U.S. Cement\n\ntimely preserved the specific issue it raises on appeal.    It did\n\nso when it excepted to the instruction that the jury could find\n\nthat age was a determining factor in Seman's discharge merely by\n\nfinding \"that younger employees were treated more favorably in\n\nthe reduction in force.\"\n\n     At a conference in the district court judge's chambers the\n\nday before the disputed instruction was given, the parties were\n\nasked to state their exceptions to the draft jury charge.   U.S.\n\nCement at that time raised essentially the same objection that it\n\nnow raises on appeal.   U.S. Cement stated:\n\f     My concern is that the jury not be confused into thinking\n     that if they find that younger employees were not terminated\n     in the reduction of force they must find that age was a\n     determining factor.\n                              * * *\n          My main concern is you have first a discussion\n      . . . of the prima facie case, then there is a discussion\n     of the employer's business reasons for the decision, then\n     there is a discussion of the reduction in force, and my\n     concern is that the jurors are going to forget that the\n     employer may have a reason for what it did.\n\n\nApp. at 478-79.\n\n     The district court decided not to modify the \"reduction in\n\nforce\" portion of the charge to reflect the concerns expressed by\n\nU.S. Cement's counsel at the in camera conference.      Seman\n\ncontends that because U.S. Cement did not renew that objection\n\nafter the jury was charged, it has waived the issue for appellate\n\nreview.   We disagree.\n\n     U.S. Cement did not have to renew its objection because the\n\ndistrict court at the in camera charging conference explicitly\n\nadvised counsel:   \"[A]nything that I don't take out that you want\n\ntaken out, or that I don't put in that you want put in, I'll\n\ngrant you an exception and you don't need to raise it again at\nthe end of -- at the end of the charge.\"    App. 477.\n\n     As written, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51 explicitly\n\nrequires that any objections to the court's charge, to be\n\npreserved for appeal, must be taken at the close of the charge,\n\n\"before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating\n\ndistinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the\n\nobjection.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.   The purpose of the rule is\n\nwell-settled -- the trial judge is afforded an opportunity to\n\fcorrect any error that may have been made in the charge before\n\nthe jury begins its deliberations.   See 9 Charles A. Wright &\n\nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure:    Civil ยง 2551\n\n(1971).   There is an exception to the rule, however, where the\n\ndistrict court judge gives explicit instructions to the parties\n\nto proceed otherwise.   As the manager of a case, the lower court\n\nis in the best position to exercise its discretion in determining\n\nthe most effective and efficient way of proceeding, given the\n\nmyriad number of ways of conducting a charge conference.    As we\n\nnoted in United States v. Agnes, 753 F.2d 293 (3d Cir. 1985), the\n\nfailure to follow rigorously the requirements of Rule 51 does not\n\npreclude appellate review when there is \"express permission by\n\nthe district court for counsel to incorporate by reference\n\nobjections made during the charge conference.\"0    Id. at 301 n.11\n\n(emphasis added); see also Bowley v. Stotler & Co., 751 F.2d 641,\n\n647 (3d Cir. 1985) (finding preservation where district court\n\ngranted counsel \"automatic exception to every adverse ruling\").\n\nThe requirement that there be an express determination by the\n\nlower court that Rule 51 will not be applied as written serves\n\nthe purpose of allowing the trial judge to direct the charging\n\nprocess in the manner the court deems most efficient, while also\n\ncreating a reviewable record for appellate purposes of the\n\nmatters as to which timely objections were made.\n\n0\n   Although Agnes was a criminal case, and thus interpreted\nFederal Rule of criminal Procedure 30, the criminal counterpart\nto Rule 51, the analysis under Rule 51 is identical. See Agnes,\n753 F.2d at 301 n.11 (citing Granite Music Corp. v. United\nArtists Corp., 532 F.2d 718, 721-22 (9th Cir. 1976)).\n\f     In the instant case, counsel for both parties were given\nexpress permission by the district court at the in camera\ncharging conference to incorporate by reference objections made\nduring that conference. If there was any doubt about that when\ncounsel left the in camera proceeding, the district court\ndispelled it the following day when it stated in open court that:\n     Again, as I said yesterday when we were discussing the\ncharge in chambers, after the charge is finished, after I\nfinished giving the charge, you don't need to take any exceptions\nto anything that you've already raised and I've ruled on. Just\nanything knew [sic].\n\n\nApp. 505.\n\n     We are satisfied that U.S. Cement preserved for our review\n\nthe issue it now presses on appeal.   That conclusion is not\n\ninconsistent with the \"policy that an appellate court will not\n\npredicate error on an issue upon which the district court was not\n\nprovided with an opportunity to rule.\"      Remington Rand Corp.-\n\nDelaware v. Business Systems, Inc., 830 F.2d 1260, 1267 (3d Cir.\n\n1987); accord Waldorf v. Shuta, 896 F.2d 723, 739 (3d Cir. 1990).\n\nHere, the district court had the opportunity to rule twice on the\n\nprecise issue raised on appeal by U.S. Cement.     As we have\n\nobserved, the district court had considered and had rejected U.S.\n\nCement's objection to the jury charge, and it also had considered\nand rejected that same argument when U.S. Cement raised it again\n\nin its motion for a new trial.   App. 67.\n\n\n\n                                 B.\n\n     Because the district court expressly preserved for appeal\n\nU.S. Cement's exception to the reduction in force instruction, we\n\nwill conduct a plenary review to determine whether the charge\n\nread as a whole accurately sets forth the correct legal standard.\n\fGriffiths, 988 F.2d at 462.   Under that standard of review, we\n\nmust agree with U.S. Cement that the jury received what was, in\n\neffect, two instructions on Seman's prima facie case.   The jury\n\nfirst was instructed that Seman had the burden of proving his\n\nprima facie case by showing \"that he was more than 40 years old,\n\nthat he was qualified, and that age was a determining factor in\n\nthe decision of defendant's to terminate his employment.\"0 App.\n\n536.   The jury also was told that there could be no violation of\n\nthe ADEA and that it would have to return a verdict for U.S.\n\nCement if it found U.S. Cement's decision to terminate Seman's\n\n\n\n0\n   After the Seman trial had concluded, we stated in Griffiths\nthat a plaintiff in a pretext case must prove that age was the\ndeterminative factor in the employer's adverse decision. 988\nF.2d at 472. Prior to Griffiths, our cases may have suggested\nthat the employer's discriminatory motive need not be the sole\nfactor causing the employment decision in a pretext case. See,\ne.g., Billet v. CIGNA Corp., 940 F.2d 812, 816 (3d Cir. 1991)\n(using \"a determinative factor\" test) (emphasis added).\nPresumably for this reason, U.S. Cement never objected at trial\nto the instruction that the jury could find U.S. Cement liable if\nSeman proved that age was only one of the reasons for his\ntermination or \"a determining factor.\"\n    After receiving the parties' briefs, we requested\nsupplemental briefing on the question of what effect, if any,\nGriffiths had on the jury instruction issue raised on appeal by\nU.S. Cement. In its supplemental brief and again at oral\nargument, U.S. Cement's counsel focused only on that aspect of\nthe Griffiths decision discussing the order and allocation of\nburdens of proof.\n    Counsel never raised the Griffiths issue of whether Seman had\nto prove that age was \"the,\" rather than \"a,\" determining factor\nin the termination decision. See Griffiths, 988 F.2d at 471-72.\nU.S. Cement therefore has waived the \"determining factor\" issue,\nand we need not decide whether the district court erred in\ncombining a mixed motive charge (plaintiff only need show that\nage was a motivating factor or one of the reasons for the\ndischarge) with a pretext charge (plaintiff must prove that age\nwas the determining factor).\n\femployment \"was made for business reasons among which age was not\n\na determining factor.\"     App. 537.\n\n     The jury then was advised that Seman could \"prove that age\n\nwas a determining factor in his discharge [by showing] that\n\nyounger employees were treated more favorably in the reduction in\n\nforce.\"   App. 537.   That instruction incorrectly states the\n\napplicable legal standard.     A decision affecting an employee in\n\nthe protected class does not become a discriminatory decision\n\n\"merely because made in the context of a reorganization, or\n\nbecause a younger employee is benefitted by the decision.\"\n\nBillet, 940 F.2d at 827.\n\n     Taken as a whole, the charge failed to convey that, once\n\nU.S. Cement put forth a legitimate business explanation, Seman\n\nhad the ultimate burden of proving that U.S. Cement intentionally\n\ndiscriminated on the basis of age.     The jury could not, as it was\n\ninstructed, find for Seman simply on the basis that younger\n\nemployees were retained by U.S. Cement.    It was not enough, in\n\nother words, to find U.S. Cement liable for age discrimination\n\nunder the ADEA merely on the basis of Seman's prima facie case;\n\nSeman had to prove intentional discrimination.\n\n     Even before the recently-decided case of Hicks, the Supreme\nCourt in United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,\n\n460 U.S. 711, 714-16 (1982), explained that the rebuttable\n\nMcDonnell-Burdine presumption created by the plaintiff-employee's\n\nprima facie case \"drops from the case\" once the employer responds\n\nby offering evidence of the reason for the plaintiff-employee's\n\nrejection, and \"the factfinder must then decide whether the\n\frejection was discriminatory . . . . [and t]he plaintiff retains\n\nthe burden of persuasion.\"     Id. (citations and internal\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n     Accordingly, any presumption of discrimination created by\n\nSeman's prima facie case had dropped out of the picture once U.S.\n\nCement articulated its facially valid business reasons for the\n\nadverse employment decision.     By instructing the jury that \"one\n\nmethod by which [Seman could] prove that age was a determining\n\nfactor in his discharge [was] to show that younger employees . .\n\n. were not terminated whereas the older employees were\n\nterminated,\" the district court well may have misled the jury to\n\nbelieve that Seman, merely by proving his prima facie case,\n\nsatisfied his burden of proof.    In so doing, the district court\n\nerred.\n\n     The potential for confusion created by the district court's\n\nfailure to explain Seman's burden of proof after U.S. Cement\n\narticulated a facially nondiscriminatory explanation was without\n\nquestion highly prejudicial to U.S. Cement.     The district court\n\nincorrectly instructed the jury that merely by virtue of\n\nretaining younger employees while terminating older protected\n\nemployees, the jury in effect could find for Seman.     The charge\n\ngiven by the district court therefore lacked clarity and content\n\nregarding the requisite elements and burden of proof.\n\n     The district court so unfairly prejudiced U.S. Cement by its\n\ncharge that we are satisfied that the error infected the judicial\n\nprocess.   Having determined that the district court's charge\n\nunjustly prejudiced U.S. Cement, we can do no less than reverse\n\fthe final order of the district court entering judgment in favor\n\nof Seman and against U.S. Cement.     See Griffiths, 988 F.2d at 472\n\n(holding that failure of district court to charge jury correctly\n\non allocation of proof requires reversal).\n\n\n\n                                 C.\n\n     By reversing the district court's judgment in favor of\n\nSeman, we are obliged to remand for a new trial.     Any new trial\n\nwill require new instructions concerning the elements which Seman\n\nmust establish and the burden of proof which he must carry.        In\n\nconducting a new trial, we are certain that the district court\n\nwill be alert to the decision of the Supreme Court in Hicks, to\n\nwhich we have previously referred.     Hicks, of course, was not\n\nfiled until June 25, 1993, five months after the district court\n\nhad charged the jury on January 28, 1993.\n\n     As Hicks makes clear, what is required to establish the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie case is \"infinitely less\" than what\n\nis needed to prove that an employer acted with a discriminatory\n\nintent.   113 S. Ct. at 2751.   Hicks requires that once an\n\nemployer has met its burden of production by coming forward with\n\na nondiscriminatory business reason for discharging a protected\n\nemployee, the plaintiff-employee must then prove that the\n\nbusiness reason was pretextual and that he was intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against on the basis of his age.     Proof of one\n\nwithout the other will not suffice.0    That is so because there is\n\n0\n   Mere proof of pretext, without a finding of discrimination, is\nnot by itself sufficient to meet the employee's ultimate burden\n\fof proof. Hicks, 113 S. Ct. at 2749 and n.4. In this regard,\nthe Hicks Court explicitly rejected the view of several courts of\nappeal that a finding of pretext mandates a finding of illegal\ndiscrimination. Hicks, 113 S.Ct. at 2750 (citing, e.g., Duffy v.\nWheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corp., 738 F.2d 1393, 1395-1396 (3d\nCir. 1984)). On this point the Court was quite clear:\n\n     [N]othing in law would permit us to substitute for the\n     required finding that the employer's action was the product\n     of unlawful discrimination, the much different (and much\n     lesser) finding that the employer's explanation of its\n     action was not believable.\n\n113 S. Ct. at 2751.\n\n    Hicks also rejects as inadvertent dictum the language in\nBurdine that suggested that a plaintiff could satisfy his\nultimate burden of proving discrimination merely \"by showing that\nthe employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\"\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 256). Many of our cases have relied on that\nnow-repudiated dictum in Burdine to suggest that a plaintiff\ncould prove intentional discrimination simply by disproving the\nemployer's facially nondiscriminatory explanation.

McDonnell Douglas does not say, at the cited\n    pages or elsewhere, that all the plaintiff need do is\n    disprove the employer's asserted reason. In fact, it says\n    just the opposite: \"[O]n retrial respondent must be given a\n    full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent\n    evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his\n    rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially\n    discriminatory decision.\" * * * The statement in question\n    also contradicts Burdine's repeated assurance (indeed, its\n    holding) regarding the burden of persuasion: \"The ultimate\n    burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant\n    intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at\n    all times with the plaintiff.\"\n\f\"no authority to impose liability upon an employer for alleged\n\ndiscriminatory employment practices unless an appropriate\n\nfactfinder determines, according to proper procedures, that the\n\nemployer has unlawfully discriminated.\"   Id.\n\n\n\n                               IV.\n\n     We, therefore, will reverse the September 23, 1993 final\n\namended judgment entered by the district court, and remand\n\n\n\n\n    * * *   And lastly, the statement renders inexplicable\n    Burdine's explicit reliance, in describing the shifting\n    burdens of McDonnell Douglas, upon authorities setting forth\n    the classic law of presumptions * * * In light of these\n    inconsistencies, we think that the dictum at issue here must\n    be regarded as an inadvertence, to the extent that it\n    describes disproof of the defendant's reason as a totally\n    independent, rather than an auxiliary, means of proving\n    unlawful intent.\n\n113 S.

Seman, on his age discrimination claim against his\n\nformer employer, appellant United States Cement Company (\"U.S.\n\nCement\"), pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(ADEA), 29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a).0    The trial jury found that Seman's\n\nage was a determining factor in U.S. Cement's decision to\n\nterminate his employment; that Seman would have been employed by\n\nU.S. Cement's successor company had Seman's age not been a factor\n\n0\n    29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a) in pertinent part provides:\n\n           It shall be unlawful for an employer--\n                (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n                individual or otherwise discriminate against any\n                individual with respect to his compensation,\n                terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n                because of such individual's age;\n                (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n                in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n                any individual of employment opportunities or\n                otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n                employee, because of such individual's age . . ..\n\fin the termination decision, and that Seman was entitled to\n\nbackpay amounting to $150,000 -- $10,000 more than Seman's\n\ncounsel had requested at trial.\n\n     On appeal, U.S. Cement assigns six points of error: (1) the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying U.S. Cement's motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a); (2) the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying U.S. Cement's\n\nmotion for a new trial on the ground that the jury verdict was\n\nexcessive and the result of passion, prejudice or caprice; (3)\n\nthe district court erred in not reducing the verdict to the\n\n$140,000 amount requested by Seman in backpay; (4) the district\n\ncourt erred in instructing the jury concerning the appropriate\n\nburden of proof; (5) the district court erred in instructing the\n\njury that it could consider whether Seman's employment would have\n\ncontinued with U.S. Cement's successor company in calculating\n\nU.S. Cement's liability for Seman's back pay; and (6) the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing U.S. Cement's request for\n\nremitter of federal income taxes on Seman's backpay award.\n\n     We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291 to review\n\nthe final amended order of the district court entered on\n\nSeptember 23, 1993.   We hold that the district court did not err\n\nin denying U.S. Cement's Rule 50(a) motion, and that the case was\n\nproperly submitted to the jury.   We also hold, however, that the\n\ndistrict court erred in its instruction to the jury.\n\n     The need to consider the merits of U.S. Cement's remaining\n\narguments is therefore obviated by our determination that the\n\nerroneous jury instruction requires reversal of the final amended\n\fjudgment entered by the district court on September 23, 1993 in\n\nfavor of Seman and against U.S. Cement in the amount of\n\n$167,827.83, including prejudgment interest.    We thus leave the\n\nremaining issues raised on this appeal by U.S. Cement for\n\ndetermination in the first instance by the district court on\n\nretrial.   Indeed, at oral argument counsel urged that we consider\n\nissues relating to backpay only if we were not persuaded that the\n\nerroneous jury instruction required reversal.\n\n     We, therefore, will reverse the September 23, 1993 final\n\namended judgment, and will remand for a new trial on Seman's ADEA\n\nclaim against U.S. Cement.\n\n\n\n                                  I.\n\n     Seman was hired by SME Bessemer Cement Company in April 1983\n\nas a cement salesman.   He retained that position when SME\n\nBessemer was purchased in April 1987 by its wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary, U.S. Cement.     Between April 1983 and January 1988,\n\nSeman was assigned to handle primarily cement field sales in\n\nsouthwestern Pennsylvania.    In January 1988, Seman was promoted\n\nto the newly-created position of assistant sales manager for U.S.\n\nCement, and worked briefly out of an office at U.S. Cement's\n\nplant office in Lowellville, Ohio.     Although U.S. Cement\n\nexecutives later testified that the assistant sales manager\n\nposition was never intended to be a permanent position, no one\n\napparently mentioned that fact to Seman.\n\n     Shortly after turning 65 on May 3, 1988, Seman was asked\n\nabout his plans for retirement by Arthur Edwards, U.S. Cement's\n\fvice president of sales.     Seman informed Edwards that he did not\n\nintend to retire for at least several years.    Within a month of\n\nthat discussion, Seman's position as assistant sales manager was\n\neliminated, and Seman was ordered back to the field without any\n\nchange in pay or benefits.    At that time, U.S. Cement had five\n\ncement salesmen:    Seman; Robert McDonough, 54; Frank Long, 41;\n\nLee Lydic, 33; and Kurt Rosander, 31.    At 65, Seman was by far\n\nthe oldest member of the cement sales force.\n\n       In September 1988, just a few months after being sent back\n\nto the field, Seman was informed by Edwards that U.S. Cement was\n\nreducing its sales force, and that the company had decided to lay\n\noff Seman and McDonough.     Seman requested reconsideration of that\n\ndecision, and suggested to Edwards that U.S. Cement's selection\n\nof its two oldest salesmen as casualties of the reduction in\n\nforce decision could be viewed as age discrimination.    Seman also\n\nthreatened to communicate with the Equal Employment Opportunities\n\nCommission (\"EEOC\") concerning the threatened layoffs.\n\nUltimately, U.S. Cement decided to retain McDonough, and to\n\nterminate Long, 41, along with Seman.\n\n       Effective October 31, 1988, Seman and Long were laid off\n\nfrom their positions as field salesmen.    Long was rehired that\n\nsame day by U.S. Cement and given another position at no loss of\n\npay.    Seman, however, was never offered reemployment in any\n\ncapacity by U.S. Cement.\n\n       On August 29, 1990, Seman commenced this action in the\n\ndistrict court, alleging a violation of the ADEA.    At trial on\n\nhis claim against U.S. Cement, Seman introduced evidence showing\n\fthat, after being approached about his plans for retirement, he\n\nwas laid off from a job for which he was qualified while younger\n\nand less-experienced salesmen were retained by U.S. Cement to\n\nperform essentially the same duties he had performed before his\n\nemployment was terminated.    The evidence also showed that all of\n\nU.S. Cement's sales people -- except for Lydic, who voluntarily\n\nleft to work for a competitor -- were retained after U.S. Cement\n\nwas acquired by ESSROC Materials, Inc. in August 1990.    For its\n\npart, U.S. Cement presented evidence to support its position that\n\nthe decision to terminate Seman's employment was based solely on\n\nlegitimate nondiscriminatory business reasons, and was not in any\n\nway motivated by Seman's age.\n\n     Following the introduction of all of the evidence, U.S.\n\nCement moved for entry of judgment as a matter of law pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).0   That motion was denied by the district\n\ncourt judge, who then submitted the case to the jury on special\n\ninterrogatories after instructing the panel on the law.   The jury\n\nwas asked to determine:\n     (1) Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that\n     plaintiff's age was a determining factor in defendant's\n     decision to terminate plaintiff's employment? [The jury\n     answered,] Yes;\n\n0\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1) provides:\n\n               If during a trial by jury a party has been fully\n          heard with respect to an issue and there is no legally\n          sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to\n          have found for that party with respect to that issue,\n          the court may grant a motion for judgment was a matter\n          of law against that party on any claim, counterclaim,\n          cross-claim, or third party claim that cannot under the\n          controlling law be maintained without a favorable\n          finding on that issue.\n\f     (2) Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that\n     plaintiff would have been employed by ESSROC after it\n     acquired, on February 27, 1990, United States Cement\n     facility at which plaintiff was formerly employed if\n     plaintiff's age had not been a factor in defendant's\n     decision to terminate plaintiff's employment? [The jury\n     answered,] Yes;\n\n     (3) To what amount of back pay is plaintiff entitled?      [The\n     jury answered,] $150,000.\n\n\nApp. 553.\n\n     A judgment in favor of Seman and against U.S. Cement was\n\nthen entered in the amount of $150,000.    U.S. Cement filed this\n\nappeal after its motion for a new trial was denied and the\n\ndistrict court entered a final order amending judgment in favor\n\nof Seman to include prejudgment interest.0\n\n\n\n                               II.\n\n     We exercise plenary review of an order granting or denying a\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law and apply the same\n\nstandard as the district court.

At that time, Seman's motion for award\nof prejudgment interest was still pending before the district\ncourt. This court on May 10, 1993 dismissed U.S. Cement's earlier\nappeal without prejudice to U.S. Cement's ability to file a new\nnotice of appeal once the district court ruled on the prejudgment\ninterest motion. The district court's final order, entered on\nSeptember 23, 1993, awarded Seman $17,827.08 in prejudgment\ninterest and accordingly amended the judgment to $167,827.83\n[sic].

For employees such as Seman who are not replaced\n\nbecause their jobs are eliminated, a prima facie case of age\n\ndiscrimination requires only a showing that the discharged\n\nemployee was at least forty years of age when his employment was\n\nterminated, and that he was laid off from a job for which he was\n\nqualified while other workers not in the protected class were\n\nretained.

The\n\nuncontroverted evidence was that, shortly after turning 65 and\n\ninforming the company that he had no plans to retire, Seman was\n\nlaid off while younger employees were retained.   The evidence\n\nalso indicated that Seman was qualified for the position; that\n\nU.S. Cement abandoned its original plan to lay off its two oldest\n\nsalesman (Seman, 65, and McDonough, 54) after Seman raised the\n\nspecter of an age discrimination complaint; and that the company\n\n\n0\n    See supra note 1.\n\finstead laid off Long, 41, along with Seman, on October 31, 1988.\n\nIn addition, the parties stipulated that U.S. Cement rehired Long\n\non October 31, 1988 for a different position at no loss of pay,\n\nand that all of the salesmen whose positions were not eliminated\n\nas part of the purported reduction in force decision were far\n\nyounger than Seman.   In short, only the 65-year-old Seman lost\n\nhis job.\n\n     U.S. Cement apparently does not dispute that Seman\n\nestablished a prima facie case of age discrimination.     Rather,\n\nU.S. Cement contends on appeal0 that Seman failed to meet his\n\nburden of proving that U.S. Cement's proffered nondiscriminatory\n\nbusiness explanation for Seman's termination, a reduction in\n\nforce, was a mere pretext for discrimination and not worthy of\n\ncredence, and that the district court thus erred in not granting\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n0\n   The record reveals that U.S. Cement's motion for judgment\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) stated no more than the\nfollowing:\n\n          MR.

Here,\nSeman has challenged all of the nondiscriminatory reasons\narticulated by U.S. Cement as pretextual, and has not presented\nany direct evidence that can fairly be said to prove a mixed\nmotive case.

The employee \"at all times\n\nbears the 'ultimate burden of persuasion.'\"     Id. (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n     In the instant case, Seman established a prima facie case\n\nand U.S. Cement in response came forward with a nondiscriminatory\n\nbusiness reason for the company's decision to terminate Seman's\n\nemployment.    According to the testimony of U.S. Cement's chief\n\noperating officer, Michael Carlow, and its vice president of\n\nsales, Edwards, the company determined in 1988 that it was\n\nnecessary to reduce the sales force because of production\n\nproblems creating a shortage of cement to satisfy current\n\ncontracts.    Edwards and Carlow insisted that Seman was selected\n\nfor termination not because of his age, but because Seman lacked\n\nbroad sales experience and the flexibility necessary to handle\n\nthe type of future sales envisaged by U.S. Cement.\n\n     Having proffered a legitimate nondiscriminatory explanation\n\nfor its decision, U.S. Cement satisfied its burden of production.\n\nConsequently, the McDonnell Douglas framework -- with its\n\npresumptions and shifting burdens -- was no longer relevant.\n\nHicks, 113 S. Ct. at 2749.    Hicks teaches, though, that rejection\n\nof the employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason will permit\n\nthe trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional\n\ndiscrimination, so long as there is a finding of discrimination.0\n\n0\n   Rejection of the employer's proffered reasons, without a\nfinding of discrimination, is insufficient to warrant judgment\nfor the employee. The employee \"at all times bears the 'ultimate\nburden of persuasion,'\" and any presumption created by the\nemployee's establishment of a prima facie case \"does not shift\nthe burden of proof\" to the employer. Hicks, 113 S.Ct. at 2749.\n\fId. at 2749 n.4.    In other words, \"[t]he factfinder's disbelief\n\nof the reasons put forward by the [employer] . . . may, together\n\nwith the elements of the [employee's] prima facie case, suffice\n\nto show intentional discrimination.\"   Id.\n\n     Here, Seman's proofs had cast doubt on U.S. Cement's\n\nfacially legitimate explanation for its adverse employment\n\ndecision.   That evidence indicated that the younger and less-\n\nexperienced salesmen retained by U.S. Cement were making calls at\n\nhouse accounts and soliciting new business in Seman's former\n\nsales territory after Seman was let go.   That evidence could have\n\nled the jury to disbelieve the nondiscriminatory explanation\n\noffered by U.S. Cement that layoffs were necessary because the\n\ncompany was committed to selling what limited cement was\n\navailable to house accounts handled only by Edwards and Carlow,\n\nand not by salesmen.\n\n     Seman also introduced evidence indicating that he had more\n\nexperience in the cement industry than the younger salesmen\n\nretained by U.S. Cement, and was more qualified than some of the\n\nyounger salesmen.   That evidence also could have been weighed by\n\nthe jury in rejecting U.S. Cement's explanation that it had\n\nretained the other salesmen instead of Seman because they had\n\nsuperior sales skills.   So, too, could the jury have weighed in\n\nSeman's favor the testimony of Carlow and Edwards that they had\n\nnever criticized Seman's job performance.\n\f     The jury could consider all of that evidence in evaluating\n\nthe merit, or lack thereof, of U.S. Cement's explanations for\n\nSeman's termination.   That evidence created factual issues\n\nrequiring a credibility assessment by the trier of the fact\n\nbefore a final determination could be made as to whether Seman\n\nhad proved his claim that U.S. Cement intentionally discriminated\n\nagainst him on the basis of age, in violation of the ADEA.\n\nJudgment as a matter of law in favor of U.S. Cement was\n\ninappropriate because Seman had established a prima facie case of\n\nage discrimination and had presented substantial evidence\n\ncreating a factual dispute concerning U.S. Cement's facially\n\nlegitimate business reasons.0\n\n     We hold therefore that the district court did not err in\n\ndenying U.S. Cement's Rule 50(a)(1) motion.

In\n\nrelevant part, the jury was instructed:\n          Plaintiff in this case claims that defendant used age\n     as a determining factor in making the decision to terminate\n     his employment.\n\n          When a plaintiff brings suit under the Act, the burden\n     of proof is on the plaintiff to prove his claim against the\n     defendant. In order to prevail on his claim, a plaintiff\n     must prove each of the following facts by the preponderance\n     of the evidence:\n\n          First, plaintiff must prove that he was within the\n     protected age group; that is, over the age of 40. I charge\n     you as a matter of law that plaintiff was within the\n     protected age group.\n\n          Second, plaintiff must prove that defendant took action\n     that adversely affected plaintiff's employment situation,\n     specifically that he was terminated from his employment with\n     defendant on October 30, 1988. Excuse me, October 31, 1988.\n\n          It is not disputed that plaintiff's employment was\n     terminated on October 31, 1988.\n\n          Third, plaintiff must prove that he was qualified for\n     the job from which he was terminated.\n\n          Fourth, plaintiff must prove that his age was a\n     determining factor in the actions taken by defendant.\n\n          To meet his burden of proof of proving that his age was\n     a determining factor, plaintiff must prove that he would not\n     have been denied the employment opportunities but for his\n     age. But for does not require that plaintiff prove that his\n     age was the sole or exclusive factor motivating defendant,\n     only that age made a difference in the employer's decision.\n     He must prove that defendant would not have terminated his\n     employment if plaintiff's age had not been taken into\n     account in deciding this matter.\n\f     The Act requires that an employer reach employment\ndecisions without regard to age, but it does not place an\naffirmative duty upon an employer to accord special\ntreatment to members of the protected group.\n\n     You must remember that the issue you are to decide is\nwhether age is the determining factor in the defendant's\ndecision. The issue is not whether defendant's reasons for\nplaintiff's termination were based on good cause or sound\nmanagement decisions. You are not to judge whether\ndefendant's decision was right or wrong from a business\nstandpoint. Rather, you are to decide whether age was a\ndetermining factor underlying defendant's decision. In\nshort, you are not to decide whether you agree or disagree\nwith defendant's actions, only whether age was a determining\nfactor.\n\n     In summary, to prevail on a claim of violation of the\nAct, plaintiff has the burden of persuading you by the fair\npreponderance of the evidence that he was more than 40 years\nold, that he was qualified, and that age was a determining\nfactor in the decision of defendant's to terminate his\nemployment. Age is a determining factor if plaintiff would\nnot have received the same treatment but for his age.\n\n     Concerning the claim made by plaintiff under the Act,\ndefendant denies that age was a determining factor in its\ndecision to terminate his employment. Defendant states that\nthis decision was made for legitimate, nondiscriminatory\nbusiness reasons unrelated to his age.\n\n     If you find defendant's decision with respect to\nplaintiff was made for business reasons among which age was\nnot a determining factor, there can be no violation of the\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act, and you must return a\nverdict for the defendant. However, if you find that\nplaintiff's age was a determining factor in the decision to\nterminate plaintiff's employment, you must return a verdict\nfor plaintiff, and you will award damages for that\ndiscrimination as I will instruct you.\n\n     In connection with plaintiff's age discrimination\nclaim, there was testimony that plaintiff's position was\neliminated for economic reasons as part of a reduction of\nforce -- in force.\n\n     One method by which an employee in a reduction in force\ncase can prove that age was a determining factor in his\ndischarge is to show that younger employees were treated\nmore favorably in the reduction in force. Such proof may\n\f     consist of evidence that younger employees were not\n     terminated whereas the older employees were terminated, or\n     that work, which was formerly performed by the older\n     employees was not reassigned or delegated to younger\n     employees who were not terminated. In these circumstances,\n     you may find age to have been a determining factor in the\n     decision to terminate such an older employee.\n\n          It is not necessary that the younger employees\n     themselves be outside the protected age class under the Act;\n     that is, it is not necessary that the younger employees be\n     less than 40 years old. The law requires only that the age\n     difference between the terminated employees and the younger\n     employees, together with other evidence of discriminatory\n     intent, be sufficient to prove to you, by a preponderance of\n     the evidence, that age was a determining factor in the\n     discharge of such an employee.\n\nApp. 534-538 (emphasis added).\n\n\n     U.S. Cement assigns error to the above-highlighted portion\n\nof the jury instruction.   Specifically, U.S. Cement contends that\n\nthe district court's language relating to the prima facie case in\n\na reduction in force case could have misled jurors to believe\n\nthat they were required to return a verdict in favor of Seman and\n\nagainst U.S. Cement solely because younger employees were not\n\nterminated.\n\n\n                                 A.\n\n     Seman contended before us at oral argument that U.S. Cement,\n\nby not raising a timely objection at the trial level, had waived\n\nits right to appellate review of this issue.   Under Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 51,\n     No party may assign   as error the giving or the failure to\n     give an instruction   unless that party objects thereto before\n     the jury retires to   consider its verdict, stating distinctly\n     the matter objected   to and the grounds of the objection.\n\f     The question of whether U.S. Cement timely and specifically\n\nobjected to the jury charge is critical to our determination of\n\nthe appropriate standard of review.

If\n\nthe issue had not been preserved through a timely objection at\n\ntrial, the \"plain error\" standard would apply.   Gibbs, 739 F.2d\n\nat 850 n.25.\n\n     We have reviewed the record and conclude that U.S. Cement\n\ntimely preserved the specific issue it raises on appeal.    It did\n\nso when it excepted to the instruction that the jury could find\n\nthat age was a determining factor in Seman's discharge merely by\n\nfinding \"that younger employees were treated more favorably in\n\nthe reduction in force.\"\n\n     At a conference in the district court judge's chambers the\n\nday before the disputed instruction was given, the parties were\n\nasked to state their exceptions to the draft jury charge.   U.S.\n\nCement at that time raised essentially the same objection that it\n\nnow raises on appeal.   U.S. Cement stated:\n\f     My concern is that the jury not be confused into thinking\n     that if they find that younger employees were not terminated\n     in the reduction of force they must find that age was a\n     determining factor.\n                              * * *\n          My main concern is you have first a discussion\n      . . . of the prima facie case, then there is a discussion\n     of the employer's business reasons for the decision, then\n     there is a discussion of the reduction in force, and my\n     concern is that the jurors are going to forget that the\n     employer may have a reason for what it did.\n\n\nApp. at 478-79.\n\n     The district court decided not to modify the \"reduction in\n\nforce\" portion of the charge to reflect the concerns expressed by\n\nU.S. Cement's counsel at the in camera conference.      Seman\n\ncontends that because U.S. Cement did not renew that objection\n\nafter the jury was charged, it has waived the issue for appellate\n\nreview.   We disagree.\n\n     U.S. Cement did not have to renew its objection because the\n\ndistrict court at the in camera charging conference explicitly\n\nadvised counsel:   \"[A]nything that I don't take out that you want\n\ntaken out, or that I don't put in that you want put in, I'll\n\ngrant you an exception and you don't need to raise it again at\nthe end of -- at the end of the charge.\"    App. 477.\n\n     As written, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51 explicitly\n\nrequires that any objections to the court's charge, to be\n\npreserved for appeal, must be taken at the close of the charge,\n\n\"before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating\n\ndistinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the\n\nobjection.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.   The purpose of the rule is\n\nwell-settled -- the trial judge is afforded an opportunity to\n\fcorrect any error that may have been made in the charge before\n\nthe jury begins its deliberations.   See 9 Charles A. Wright &\n\nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure:    Civil ยง 2551\n\n(1971).   There is an exception to the rule, however, where the\n\ndistrict court judge gives explicit instructions to the parties\n\nto proceed otherwise.   As the manager of a case, the lower court\n\nis in the best position to exercise its discretion in determining\n\nthe most effective and efficient way of proceeding, given the\n\nmyriad number of ways of conducting a charge conference.

As we have\n\nobserved, the district court had considered and had rejected U.S.\n\nCement's objection to the jury charge, and it also had considered\nand rejected that same argument when U.S. Cement raised it again\n\nin its motion for a new trial.   App. 67.\n\n\n\n                                 B.\n\n     Because the district court expressly preserved for appeal\n\nU.S. Cement's exception to the reduction in force instruction, we\n\nwill conduct a plenary review to determine whether the charge\n\nread as a whole accurately sets forth the correct legal standard.\n\fGriffiths, 988 F.2d at 462.   Under that standard of review, we\n\nmust agree with U.S. Cement that the jury received what was, in\n\neffect, two instructions on Seman's prima facie case.   The jury\n\nfirst was instructed that Seman had the burden of proving his\n\nprima facie case by showing \"that he was more than 40 years old,\n\nthat he was qualified, and that age was a determining factor in\n\nthe decision of defendant's to terminate his employment.\"0 App.\n\n536.   The jury also was told that there could be no violation of\n\nthe ADEA and that it would have to return a verdict for U.S.\n\nCement if it found U.S. Cement's decision to terminate Seman's\n\n\n\n0\n   After the Seman trial had concluded, we stated in Griffiths\nthat a plaintiff in a pretext case must prove that age was the\ndeterminative factor in the employer's adverse decision. 988\nF.2d at 472. Prior to Griffiths, our cases may have suggested\nthat the employer's discriminatory motive need not be the sole\nfactor causing the employment decision in a pretext case. See,\ne.g., Billet v. CIGNA Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566008\"><a href=\"/opinion/566008/56-fair-emplpraccas-730-56-empl-prac-dec-p-40887-lewis-h-billet/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 816 (3d Cir. 1991)\n(using \"a determinative factor\" test) (emphasis added).\nPresumably for this reason, U.S. Cement never objected at trial\nto the instruction that the jury could find U.S. Cement liable if\nSeman proved that age was only one of the reasons for his\ntermination or \"a determining factor.\"\n    After receiving the parties' briefs, we requested\nsupplemental briefing on the question of what effect, if any,\nGriffiths had on the jury instruction issue raised on appeal by\nU.S. Cement. In its supplemental brief and again at oral\nargument, U.S. Cement's counsel focused only on that aspect of\nthe Griffiths decision discussing the order and allocation of\nburdens of proof.\n    Counsel never raised the Griffiths issue of whether Seman had\nto prove that age was \"the,\" rather than \"a,\" determining factor\nin the termination decision. See Griffiths, 988 F.2d at 471-72.\nU.S. Cement therefore has waived the \"determining factor\" issue,\nand we need not decide whether the district court erred in\ncombining a mixed motive charge (plaintiff only need show that\nage was a motivating factor or one of the reasons for the\ndischarge) with a pretext charge (plaintiff must prove that age\nwas the determining factor).\n\femployment \"was made for business reasons among which age was not\n\na determining factor.\"     App. 537.\n\n     The jury then was advised that Seman could \"prove that age\n\nwas a determining factor in his discharge [by showing] that\n\nyounger employees were treated more favorably in the reduction in\n\nforce.\"   App. 537.   That instruction incorrectly states the\n\napplicable legal standard.     A decision affecting an employee in\n\nthe protected class does not become a discriminatory decision\n\n\"merely because made in the context of a reorganization, or\n\nbecause a younger employee is benefitted by the decision.\"\n\nBillet, 940 F.2d at 827.\n\n     Taken as a whole, the charge failed to convey that, once\n\nU.S. Cement put forth a legitimate business explanation, Seman\n\nhad the ultimate burden of proving that U.S. Cement intentionally\n\ndiscriminated on the basis of age.     The jury could not, as it was\n\ninstructed, find for Seman simply on the basis that younger\n\nemployees were retained by U.S. Cement.    It was not enough, in\n\nother words, to find U.S. Cement liable for age discrimination\n\nunder the ADEA merely on the basis of Seman's prima facie case;\n\nSeman had to prove intentional discrimination.\n\n     Even before the recently-decided case of Hicks, the Supreme\nCourt in United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 714-16 (1982), explained that the rebuttable\n\nMcDonnell-Burdine presumption created by the plaintiff-employee's\n\nprima facie case \"drops from the case\" once the employer responds\n\nby offering evidence of the reason for the plaintiff-employee's\n\nrejection, and \"the factfinder must then decide whether the\n\frejection was discriminatory . . . . [and t]he plaintiff retains\n\nthe burden of persuasion.\"     Id. (citations and internal\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n     Accordingly, any presumption of discrimination created by\n\nSeman's prima facie case had dropped out of the picture once U.S.\n\nCement articulated its facially valid business reasons for the\n\nadverse employment decision.     By instructing the jury that \"one\n\nmethod by which [Seman could] prove that age was a determining\n\nfactor in his discharge [was] to show that younger employees . .\n\n. were not terminated whereas the older employees were\n\nterminated,\" the district court well may have misled the jury to\n\nbelieve that Seman, merely by proving his prima facie case,\n\nsatisfied his burden of proof.    In so doing, the district court\n\nerred.\n\n     The potential for confusion created by the district court's\n\nfailure to explain Seman's burden of proof after U.S. Cement\n\narticulated a facially nondiscriminatory explanation was without\n\nquestion highly prejudicial to U.S. Cement.     The district court\n\nincorrectly instructed the jury that merely by virtue of\n\nretaining younger employees while terminating older protected\n\nemployees, the jury in effect could find for Seman.     The charge\n\ngiven by the district court therefore lacked clarity and content\n\nregarding the requisite elements and burden of proof.\n\n     The district court so unfairly prejudiced U.S. Cement by its\n\ncharge that we are satisfied that the error infected the judicial\n\nprocess.   Having determined that the district court's charge\n\nunjustly prejudiced U.S. Cement, we can do no less than reverse\n\fthe final order of the district court entering judgment in favor\n\nof Seman and against U.S. Cement.     See Griffiths, 988 F.2d at 472\n\n(holding that failure of district court to charge jury correctly\n\non allocation of proof requires reversal).\n\n\n\n                                 C.\n\n     By reversing the district court's judgment in favor of\n\nSeman, we are obliged to remand for a new trial.     Any new trial\n\nwill require new instructions concerning the elements which Seman\n\nmust establish and the burden of proof which he must carry.        In\n\nconducting a new trial, we are certain that the district court\n\nwill be alert to the decision of the Supreme Court in Hicks, to\n\nwhich we have previously referred.     Hicks, of course, was not\n\nfiled until June 25, 1993, five months after the district court\n\nhad charged the jury on January 28, 1993.\n\n     As Hicks makes clear, what is required to establish the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie case is \"infinitely less\" than what\n\nis needed to prove that an employer acted with a discriminatory\n\nintent.   113 S. Ct. at 2751.   Hicks requires that once an\n\nemployer has met its burden of production by coming forward with\n\na nondiscriminatory business reason for discharging a protected\n\nemployee, the plaintiff-employee must then prove that the\n\nbusiness reason was pretextual and that he was intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against on the basis of his age.     Proof of one\n\nwithout the other will not suffice.0    That is so because there is\n\n0\n   Mere proof of pretext, without a finding of discrimination, is\nnot by itself sufficient to meet the employee's ultimate burden\n\fof proof. Hicks, 113 S. Ct. at 2749 and n.4. In this regard,\nthe Hicks Court explicitly rejected the view of several courts of\nappeal that a finding of pretext mandates a finding of illegal\ndiscrimination. Hicks, 113 S.Ct. at 2750 (citing, e.g., Duffy v.\nWheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438811\"><a href=\"/opinion/438811/35-fair-emplpraccas-246-34-empl-prac-dec-p-34527-duffy-douglass-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1393</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1395-1396 (3d\nCir. 1984)). On this point the Court was quite clear:\n\n     [N]othing in law would permit us to substitute for the\n     required finding that the employer's action was the product\n     of unlawful discrimination, the much different (and much\n     lesser) finding that the employer's explanation of its\n     action was not believable.\n\n113 S. Ct. at 2751.\n\n    Hicks also rejects as inadvertent dictum the language in\nBurdine that suggested that a plaintiff could satisfy his\nultimate burden of proving discrimination merely \"by showing that\nthe employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\"\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 256). Many of our cases have relied on that\nnow-repudiated dictum in Burdine to suggest that a plaintiff\ncould prove intentional discrimination simply by disproving the\nemployer's facially nondiscriminatory explanation.

McDonnell Douglas does not say, at the cited\n    pages or elsewhere, that all the plaintiff need do is\n    disprove the employer's asserted reason. In fact, it says\n    just the opposite: \"[O]n retrial respondent must be given a\n    full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent\n    evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his\n    rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially\n    discriminatory decision.\" * * * The statement in question\n    also contradicts Burdine's repeated assurance (indeed, its\n    holding) regarding the burden of persuasion: \"The ultimate\n    burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant\n    intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at\n    all times with the plaintiff.\"\n\f\"no authority to impose liability upon an employer for alleged\n\ndiscriminatory employment practices unless an appropriate\n\nfactfinder determines, according to proper procedures, that the\n\nemployer has unlawfully discriminated.\"   Id.\n\n\n\n                               IV.\n\n     We, therefore, will reverse the September 23, 1993 final\n\namended judgment entered by the district court, and remand\n\n\n\n\n    * * *   And lastly, the statement renders inexplicable\n    Burdine's explicit reliance, in describing the shifting\n    burdens of McDonnell Douglas, upon authorities setting forth\n    the classic law of presumptions * * * In light of these\n    inconsistencies, we think that the dictum at issue here must\n    be regarded as an inadvertence, to the extent that it\n    describes disproof of the defendant's reason as a totally\n    independent, rather than an auxiliary, means of proving\n    unlawful intent.\n\n113 S. Ct. at 2752-53 (citations and footnote omitted).\n\ffor a new trial on Seman's ADEA claim against U.S. Cement,\n\nconsistent with the foregoing opinion.\n\f</pre>",
