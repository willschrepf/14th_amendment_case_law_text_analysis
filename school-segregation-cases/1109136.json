Introduction\n\n      Defendant Johnny Barrientos, a deputy of the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment, appeals the district court’s denial of his motion for summary\n\njudgment in a 28 U.S.C. § 1983 action brought by Lucia Fancher, individually and\n\non behalf of the estate of her son, Nick Dominguez. Fancher alleges Barrientos\n\nused excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he shot\n\nDominguez seven times following a confrontation in Mesquite, New Mexico.\n\nDominguez died as a result of one or more gunshot wounds. Barrientos asserts he\n\nis entitled to qualified immunity because his use of deadly force was objectively\n\nreasonable and did not violate clearly established law. The district court granted\n\nBarrientos’s motion for summary judgment to the extent Fancher’s claim arose\n\nfrom the firing of the initial shot, but denied the motion to the extent the claim\n\narose from the firing of the subsequent six shots.\n\n      On appeal, Barrientos makes three arguments. First, he asserts the district\n\ncourt erred in analyzing the second through seventh shots separately from the first\n\nshot. Next, he argues the district court did not sufficiently consider the risks\n\nposed to third parties in analyzing the reasonableness of shots two through seven.\n\nFinally, he argues the law was not clearly established that his actions violated the\n\nFourth Amendment. This court lacks jurisdiction to consider the first two\n\narguments, and is unpersuaded by the third. Thus, exercising jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fpursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court affirms the denial of summary judgment\n\nby the district court. 1\n\nII.    Background\n\n       Because, when reviewing the denial of a summary judgment motion\n\nasserting qualified immunity, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court’s\n\nconclusions as to what facts the plaintiffs may be able to prove at trial, Fogarty v.\n\nGallegos, 523 F.3d 1147, 1154 (10th Cir. 2008); see also supra Part III.A., we\n\nrestate the district court’s account of the relevant factual background here:\n\n               On March 29, 2010, at approximately 5:41 p.m., Deputy\n       Barrientos responded to a reported theft of two 20-packs of bottled\n       Budweiser beer from the Mesquite Mercantile in Mesquite, New\n       Mexico. There was no report that the suspects were armed or\n       threatening. Deputy Barrientos was on duty, in full uniform with his\n       badge displayed, and driving a marked patrol vehicle. Defendant\n       Barrientos was issued two patrol rifles, but his squad car was\n       equipped with only one lock for one of the rifles. He had the assault\n       rifle in the front seat of his car . . . .\n\n              Upon arrival at the Mercantile, Deputy Barrientos interviewed\n       a female clerk who told him that the manager in the back office had a\n       security camera video of the theft. Deputy Barrientos reviewed the\n       video, which showed a male in a white shirt and blue jeans at the\n\n\n       1\n        Fancher’s complaint also includes claims against Sheriff Todd Garrison in\nhis individual and official capacities as well as the County of Doña Ana.\nAlthough all defendants filed the notice of appeal, the only issues raised relate to\nthe denial of qualified immunity to Barrientos. Sheriff Garrison did not claim\nentitlement to qualified immunity and the county is not entitled to qualified\nimmunity, Starkey ex rel. A.B. v. Boulder Cnty. Soc. Servs., 569 F.3d 1244, 1263\nn.4 (10th Cir. 2009) (“Qualified immunity . . . is available only in suits against\nofficials sued in their personal capacities, not in suits against governmental\nentities or officials sued in their official capacities.”).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      counter, and a second male wearing a black jacket and black pants\n      moving quickly across the screen. The clerk told Deputy Barrientos\n      that the individual at the counter was named Michael and might live\n      in a trailer near Highway 192.\n\n             Deputy Barrientos began searching the property outside the\n      Mercantile when police dispatch advised him at approximately 6:02\n      p.m. of a trespass involving two vehicles and several subjects\n      drinking at the Helena Chemical plant, across the road from the\nMercantile. While proceeding to the plant, Deputy Barrientos observed a male\nwearing a white shirt and blue jeans riding a bicycle down an alley. Deputy\nBarrientos stopped the bicyclist for questioning at approximately 6:06 p.m.\nDeputy Barrientos identified the bicyclist as an older man named Carlos\nCeniceros, who informed him that he knew where the individuals who stole the\nbeer were and that they were near a red car.\n\n             As Deputy Barrientos interviewed Mr. Ceniceros, a man from a\n      nearby house approached them and stated that the suspects were in\n      the area of an irrigation canal by a tree. Deputy Barrientos began\n      searching for the suspects, driving his patrol vehicle northbound on\n      the east side of a large irrigation canal accessible from Highway 192.\n      He spotted a red car turn onto the west side of the canal driving\n      northbound. Believing that the red car was associated with the theft\n      at the Mercantile, Deputy Barrientos activated his emergency\n      equipment and initiated a traffic stop at approximately 6:18 p.m. The\n      red car yielded at a tree near the intersection of the large irrigation\n      canal and a smaller canal.\n\n             Deputy Barrientos’s practice and training are to leave the\n      patrol vehicle running with the emergency equipment engaged during\n      traffic stops. The window was down to facilitate his visual search of\n      the area. The squad car was parked facing north on a clearing of\n      hard dirt.\n\n             Deputy Barrientos approached and questioned the driver who\n      remained in the car. Because the driver was a man in his late fifties\n      and the sole occupant of the vehicle, Deputy Barrientos concluded\n      that he was not involved in the theft and released him.\n\n            Immediately after the red car drove off, Deputy Barrientos\n      observed Mr. Ceniceros seated on the ground across the large canal\n\n                                        -4-\n\fto the northeast. Deputy Barrientos had not moved from where he\nhad been standing beside the driver’s door of the red car. He walked\ntoward Mr. Ceniceros to question him further about the suspects.\nThere was a water pipe spanning the large canal which allowed foot\ntraffic to move from one side to the other. When asked about the\nsuspects’ location, Mr. Ceniceros said he did not know, but indicated\nbehind Deputy Barrientos with his eyes and by nodding.\n\n       Just then, Deputy Barrientos heard a noise behind him and\nturned around to see that a beer bottle had landed near him. The\nbottle landed between 10 to 15 feet away from him. In his\nexperience, a bottle can be used as a weapon. He was still unable to\nsee the suspects.\n\n       Because the thrown beer bottle indicated someone was hiding\nand he did not know who it was or what was going on, Deputy\nBarrientos drew his weapon and walked toward a large irrigation\npump in order to see behind it. Using a tactical maneuver that he\nwas trained to use, Deputy Barrientos moved around the pump in an\nattempt to expose the suspects while maintaining a safe distance.\nDeputy Barrientos saw two young men and a young woman hiding in\na depression on the far side of a steel I-beam that served as a\nfoundation for the pump. Deputy Barrientos recognized one of the\nyoung men who wore a white shirt and blue jeans, later identified as\nMichael Herrera, from the Mercantile security video. Deputy\nBarrientos also recognized his own cousin, Valerie Gonzalez, and\nwas concerned that she might try to harm him because she had gang\naffiliations and had previously made negative comments about the\nfact that Deputy Barrientos was a law enforcement officer. The\nsecond young man, wearing black pants without a shirt, was later\nidentified as Nick Dominguez. Nick Dominguez was 17 years of age\nat the time.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos notified dispatch at 6:21 p.m. that he had\nthree suspects at gun point. He then commanded the subjects to\nshow their hands. Mr. Herrera complied while remaining on his\nknees. Ms. Gonzalez also complied. Mr. Dominguez, however,\nremained crouched on the ground concealing his hands, which\nconcerned Deputy Barrientos because he feared that the suspects\ncould have weapons concealed in their clothing. Mr. Dominguez’s\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffailure to comply prevented Deputy Barrientos from frisking the\nsuspects to this point.\n\n      Deputy Barrientos commanded Ms. Gonzalez to step over the\nI-beam and lie down, and she complied. Mr. Herrera remained on his\nknees and kept his hands raised. Deputy Barrientos ordered Mr.\nDominguez to move closer to him and to step over the I-beam and lie\ndown next to Ms. Gonzalez. After refusing to comply with several\ncommands, Mr. Dominguez stepped over the I-beam but did not lie\ndown as instructed. Instead, Mr. Dominguez moved toward Deputy\nBarrientos in three motions, asking “right here?” each time. Mr.\nDominguez moved within a couple of feet of Deputy Barrientos.\nDeputy Barrientos again ordered Mr. Dominguez to lie down, but\ninstead he dropped to one knee and then suddenly lunged at Deputy\nBarrientos, grabbing his duty weapon with both hands.\n\n       As the two men struggled, Mr. Dominguez yelled to the other\nsuspects to run away. Deputy Barrientos again commanded Mr.\nDominguez to release his weapon and get on the ground but he did\nnot comply. During the struggle, Ms. Gonzalez remained prone on\nthe ground with her head and shoulders toward Deputy Barrientos\nand Mr. Dominguez, while Mr. Herrera remained on his knees. Both\nsuspects were just a few feet away from the struggle.\n\n       The men fell to their knees with Mr. Dominguez on Deputy\nBarrientos’s left side. The weapon discharged into the ground and\nmalfunctioned. The discharge concerned Deputy Barrientos because\nthe bullet could have struck himself, Ms. Gonzalez, or Mr. Herrera,\nwho were both just a few feet away; Mr. Ceniceros, who was a few\nyards away; or an occupant at one of the residences across the field.\nAfter the weapon discharged, Mr. Dominguez continued trying to\ntake it away from Deputy Barrientos. Deputy Barrientos forced the\nweapon’s barrel into the dirt and then drew his taser.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos tasered Mr. Dominguez in the back.\nAlthough the taser deployed, it did not work. Mr. Dominguez then\nlet go of the gun, pushed free from the struggle, and fled directly\ntoward the patrol vehicle, jumping over the smaller irrigation canal.\nDeputy Barrientos saw that the malfunction was a so-called “stove\npipe” jam, where the spent shell casing lodges in the ejection port\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fand prevents the weapon from firing. He quickly cleared the\nmalfunction and ran after Mr. Dominguez.\n\n       Mr. Dominguez entered the driver’s side of the patrol vehicle\njust as Deputy Barrientos caught up to him. At that moment, Deputy\nBarrientos was aware that Mr. Dominguez had just tried to take his\nduty weapon away from him and that there were two loaded long\nguns in the vehicle. Deputy Barrientos believed that a round fired\nfrom one of the long guns, an AR-15 assault rifle, could have struck\na nearby residence.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos quickly approached the patrol vehicle and,\nwith his duty weapon in his right hand, tried to remove the ignition\nkeys with his left hand while shouting at Mr. Dominguez to stop and\nget out of the vehicle. Mr. Dominguez pushed Deputy Barrientos’s\nleft hand away, resisting his attempt to remove the ignition keys.\nThe engine was racing. As Deputy Barrientos struggled to remove\nthe ignition keys, Mr. Dominguez shifted the patrol vehicle into\nreverse.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos fired his duty weapon at Mr. Dominguez’s\ncenter mass, or chest area. He began firing his weapon before the\nvehicle started going backwards. Deputy Barrientos was sure that he\nhad hit Mr. Dominguez with the initial shot to the chest because he\nsaw him slump.\n\n       After firing his weapon, the car began to press up against his\nshoulder. He could feel the car pushing him away and turning him to\nthe right. Deputy Barrientos testified that he took two or three steps\naway from the car after the first shot. He testified that he felt safer\nafter he backed away from the vehicle. The squad car continued to\nmove in reverse, away from Deputy Barrientos. He nevertheless\ncontinued shooting at Mr. Dominguez after he had moved backwards\nthose two to three steps, even though he did not at that time have any\nindication that Mr. Dominguez was armed.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos fired seven shots. Mr. Herrera heard a\nperiod of silence between two separate rounds of gunfire. He heard a\nseries of gunshots, followed by five to seven seconds in which he did\nnot hear any gunshots, followed by the sound of two more gunshots.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f       Mr. Ceniceros saw Deputy Barrientos fire shots at Mr.\nDominguez while he was in the car. Immediately after Deputy\nBarrientos fired the last shot, Mr. Ceniceros saw Deputy Barrientos\nat a distance of between eight to ten feet from the side of the squad\ncar.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos testified that, if his long gun had not been\nin the car, he likely would not have shot Mr. Dominguez. Although\nhe had mace on him at the time he first shot Mr. Dominguez and was\nwithin range to use it, Deputy Barrientos did not consider using it\ninstead of deadly force. Deputy Barrientos was sure that firing his\nweapon effectively eliminated any threat posed by Mr. Dominguez.\nAt 6:22 p.m., Deputy Barrientos notified dispatch that the subject\nwas down.\n\n....\n\n       New Mexico State Police Agent Norman Rhoades was\nassigned to be the “crime scene manager” of the crime scene in this\ncase. Based on Deputy Barrientos’s initial statement describing\nevents and evidence at the crime scene, Agent Rhoades prepared\ncrime scene diagrams. The diagrams show that the squad car moved\nin a backwards arc from its initial position and came to a stop at the\nend of its backward arc in a field of weeds and fine sand. Based on\nhis investigation, Agent Rhoades determined that, when Mr.\nDominguez was behind the wheel of the squad car, the car only\nmoved in reverse away from Deputy Barrientos.\n\n       Agent Rhoades indicated in the diagrams that a shot into the\nchest through the heart was “Possibly 2nd shot;” the shot into the\nupper left front seat backrest was “Possibly 3rd shot;” the shot into\nthe upper left front door was “Possibly 4th shot;” and the shot into\nthe lower left front door was “Possibly 5th shot.” Agent Rhoades\nacknowledged, though, that the sequences 2 through 5 in the\ndiagrams “could be altered as far as the sequence goes.” He\nexplained that, for example, wound C could have just as likely been\ncaused by shot 2, 3, 4, or 5. The diagrams further state: “Possibly\n6th shot, into upper left front door striking both arms,” and “Possibly\n7th shot, striking suspect’s head.” Agent Rhoades acknowledged that\nshots 6 and 7 could be re-sequenced.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fMem. Op. & Order at 1–10 (citations omitted).\n\n      Fancher brought suit under 28 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging Barrientos’s use of\n\ndeadly force against Dominguez was unreasonable and violated the Fourth\n\nAmendment. Barrientos moved for summary judgment, arguing he was entitled to\n\nqualified immunity because his use of deadly force was objectively reasonable as\n\na matter of law. Relying heavily on Thomas v. Durastanti, 607 F.3d 655, 665\n\n(10th Cir. 2010), the district court concluded Barrientos did not violate\n\nDominguez’s constitutional rights by firing the first shot because his reaction to a\n\nviolent, fleeing felon was objectively reasonable. Alternatively, the court\n\nconcluded it was not clearly established at the time of the shooting that\n\nBarrientos’s firing of the first shot was unlawful. The district court also\n\nconcluded, however, that multiple unresolved factual issues precluded summary\n\njudgment as to the firing of the remaining shots:\n\n      Deputy Barrientos testified that he saw Mr. Dominguez slump after\n      the first shot. He also testified that, after the first shot, he stepped\n      away from the car, and thus, was not in immediate danger of being\n      run over with the vehicle, which was moving backwards away from\n      him. Significantly, Deputy Barrientos testified that he felt safer after\n      having taken those steps away from the vehicle. Additionally,\n      Deputy Barrientos’s testimony indicated that Mr. Dominguez was not\n      reaching for the long guns in the vehicle after the first shot.\n\n             A jury could construe Mr. Dominguez’s slumping as an\n      indication that he was no longer able to control the vehicle, to\n      escape, or to fire a long gun, and thus, may no longer have presented\n      a danger to the public, Deputy Barrientos, or other responding\n      officers. Moreover, a jury could also reasonably construe Deputy\n      Barrientos’s testimony that he did not fire the second shot until after\n\n                                         -9-\n\f       he stepped back, felt safer, and noticed Mr. Dominguez slump as\n       indicating that enough time passed between the first and second shots\n       for Deputy Barrientos to recognize and react to the changed\n       circumstances and cease firing his gun. There is thus a question of\n       fact as to whether, under the totality of circumstances, Deputy\n       Barrientos reasonably perceived that he or others were in danger at\n       the precise moments that he fired shots two through seven, and thus,\n       whether those additional shots were excessive.\n\nMem. Op. & Order at 30. The court therefore denied qualified immunity to\n\nBarrientos as to shots two through seven. This appeal followed.\n\nIII.   Discussion\n\n       A.    Jurisdiction 2 and Standard of Review\n\n       This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to review “all final\n\ndecisions of the district courts of the United States.” Ordinarily, an order denying\n\nsummary judgment is not a “final decision” within the meaning of § 1291.\n\nAllstate Sweeping, LLC v. Black, 706 F.3d 1261, 1266 (10th Cir. 2013). The\n\ndenial of qualified immunity to a public official, however, is immediately\n\nappealable under the collateral order doctrine to the extent it involves abstract\n\nissues of law. Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 317 (1995); Armijo ex rel. Chavez\n\nv. Wagon Mound Pub. Sch., 159 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 1998). Thus, “[a]\n\ndetermination that the law allegedly violated by the defendant was clearly\n\nestablished at the time of the challenged actions is an abstract issue of law that is\n\n\n       2\n        This court has an independent obligation to ensure it has subject matter\njurisdiction at every stage of the litigation. Devon Energy Prod. Co. v. Mosaic\nPotash Carlsbad, Inc., 693 F.3d 1195, 1208 n.10 (10th Cir. 2012).\n\n                                        -10-\n\fimmediately appealable. A determination that under either party’s version of the\n\nfacts the defendant violated clearly established law is also immediately\n\nappealable.” Foote v. Spiegel, 118 F.3d 1416, 1422 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\n      This court, however, lacks jurisdiction at this stage “to review a district\n\ncourt’s factual conclusions, such as the existence of a genuine issue of material\n\nfact for a jury to decide, or that a plaintiff’s evidence is sufficient to support a\n\nparticular factual inference.” Fogarty, 523 F.3d at 1154. Thus, in reviewing the\n\ndistrict court’s rejection of Barrientos’s qualified immunity defense, “we must\n\nscrupulously avoid second-guessing the district court’s determinations regarding\n\nwhether [Fancher] has presented evidence sufficient to survive summary\n\njudgment.” Clanton v. Cooper, 129 F.3d 1147, 1153 (10th Cir. 1997). 3\n\n      Within this court’s limited jurisdiction, we review the district court’s denial\n\nof a summary judgment motion asserting qualified immunity de novo. Dodds v.\n\n\n      3\n        Johnson’s jurisdictional rule is subject to a few exceptions. If the district\ncourt does not “identify the particular charged conduct that it deemed adequately\nsupported by the record, we may look behind the order denying summary\njudgment and review the entire record de novo to determine for ourselves as a\nmatter of law which factual inferences a reasonable jury could and could not\nmake.” Lewis v. Tripp, 604 F.3d 1221, 1225 (10th Cir. 2010). “Second, when the\n‘version of events’ the district court holds a reasonable jury could credit ‘is\nblatantly contradicted by the record,’ we may assess the case based on our own de\nnovo view of which facts a reasonable jury could accept as true.” Id. at 1225–26\n(quoting Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007)). Finally, this court “need not\ndefer to the district court’s assessment of the reasonable factual inferences that\narise from a complaint at the motion to dismiss stage.” Id. at 1226. The first and\nthird of these exceptions are plainly inapplicable, and Barrientos has not\nadvanced an argument in support of the second.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fRichardson, 614 F.3d 1185, 1192 (10th Cir. 2010). “When a defendant asserts\n\nqualified immunity at summary judgment, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to\n\nshow that: (1) the defendant violated a constitutional right and (2) the\n\nconstitutional right was clearly established.” Martinez v. Beggs, 563 F.3d 1082,\n\n1088 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n      B.     Barrientos’s Assertion of Qualified Immunity\n\n      1.     “Segmented” Analysis\n\n      Barrientos first argues the district court erred in analyzing shots two\n\nthrough seven separately from the first shot. Barrientos nominally frames this\n\nargument as a legal issue, asserting that segregating the shots as the district court\n\ndid constitutes a “misapplication of the totality of the circumstances standard”\n\nwhich is applied when analyzing excessive force claims. See Graham v. Connor,\n\n490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989) (holding that determining whether force was excessive\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment “requires careful attention to the facts and\n\ncircumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue,\n\nwhether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or\n\nothers, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by\n\nflight”); Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 3 (1985) (holding deadly force may not\n\nbe used “to prevent the escape of an apparently unarmed suspected felon . . .\n\nunless it is necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to\n\nbelieve that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical\n\n                                         -12-\n\finjury to the officer or others”). Ultimately, however, Barrientos’s argument\n\ndepends upon a challenge to the facts the district court concluded a reasonable\n\njury could infer based upon the evidence in the summary judgment record. For\n\nexample, Barrientos asserts the district court’s use of a segmented approach was\n\nerror “when the facts of the incident are that Barrientos and the public were\n\nplaced in danger from the moment he was attacked by the decedent until the time\n\nthat Barrientos was completely sure that neither he nor the public were in further\n\ndanger.” Appellant’s Br. at 19 (emphasis added).\n\n      The district court relied on Thomas for the proposition that “circumstances\n\nmay change within seconds eliminating the justification for deadly force.” 607\n\nF.3d at 666; accord Waterman v. Batton, 393 F.3d 471, 481 (4th Cir. 2005) (“We\n\ntherefore hold that force justified at the beginning of an encounter is not justified\n\neven seconds later if the justification for the initial force has been eliminated.”).\n\nBarrientos does not take issue with the district court’s reliance on Thomas or\n\nWaterman as an abstract legal matter, i.e., he does not argue it is never\n\nappropriate in an incident involving the firing of multiple shots by a police officer\n\nto analyze the shots separately if the circumstances so warrant. Instead,\n\nBarrientos strenuously argues that the circumstances of this case are not amenable\n\nto such analysis. Specifically, he argues that, unlike the situation in Waterman,\n\n“the threat of harm caused by the decedent to Barrientos and to nearby community\n\nmembers existed for the duration of the approximately ninety . . . second\n\n                                         -13-\n\fincident.” Appellant’s Br. at 22. The district court, however, concluded the\n\nevidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to draw a contrary inference:\n\n      Although in some circumstances multiple shots fired in a matter of\n      seconds should be grouped together in the qualified immunity\n      analysis, this case is different. Here, there is evidence that Deputy\n      Barrientos had time between the first shot and the following shots to\n      take a few steps back to get out of the way of the car, to assess the\n      situation, and to know that Mr. Dominguez had slumped and may not\n      have presented a continuing danger to himself or to the public.\n\nMem. Op. & Order at 16. Because Barrientos’s first argument on appeal cannot\n\nreasonably be understood as anything other than an attack on these conclusions of\n\nthe district court, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. Fogarty, 523 F.3d at\n\n1154; Clanton, 129 F.3d at 1153.\n\n      2.     Danger to Third Parties\n\n      Barrientos’s second argument on appeal is similarly unreviewable.\n\nBarrientos argues the district court did not consider the risk posed to third parties\n\nin applying the segmented approach. In support of this argument Barrientos lists\n\nseveral material facts which he alleges the district court failed to consider when\n\nanalyzing whether Dominguez posed a continuing threat after the first shot.\n\nBarrientos goes on to argue that these facts should have led the district court to\n\nconclude that he “could not reasonably have known that [Dominguez] was\n\nsufficiently subdued such that he no longer presented a threat to the officer or the\n\ncommunity when Deputy Barrientos fired shots two through seven.” Id. at 25.\n\nAgain, Barrientos’s argument amounts to nothing more than a request for review\n\n                                         -14-\n\fof the “factual conclusions” of the district court, a task which exceeds the scope\n\nof our jurisdiction on interlocutory review of the denial of qualified immunity.\n\nFogarty, 523 F.3d at 1154.\n\n      3.     Clearly Established Law\n\n      Unlike Barrientos’s first two arguments, his third presents no jurisdictional\n\ndifficulties. Whether a constitutional right was clearly established at the time an\n\nalleged violation occurred is a “quintessential” example of a purely legal\n\ndetermination fit for interlocutory review. Garrett v. Stratman, 254 F.3d 946, 952\n\nn.8 (10th Cir. 2001). Nonetheless, in light of the facts we must assume to be true\n\nat this stage of the proceedings, we readily conclude Barrientos’s argument is\n\nwithout merit. In Casey v. City of Federal Heights, this court discussed the\n\n“clearly established” standard in the context of excessive force claims:\n\n      Ordinarily . . . for a rule to be clearly established there must be a\n      Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit decision on point, or the clearly\n      established weight of authority from other courts must have found\n      the law to be as the plaintiff maintains. However, because excessive\n      force jurisprudence requires an all-things-considered inquiry with\n      “careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular\n      case,” Graham, 490 U.S. at 396, there will almost never be a\n      previously published opinion involving exactly the same\n      circumstances. We cannot find qualified immunity wherever we\n      have a new fact pattern. Indeed, the Supreme Court has warned that\n      “officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established\n      law even in novel factual circumstances.” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S.\n      730, 741 (2002). The Hope decision shifted the qualified immunity\n      analysis from a scavenger hunt for prior cases with precisely the\n      same facts toward the more relevant inquiry of whether the law put\n      officials on fair notice that the described conduct was\n      unconstitutional.\n\n                                         -15-\n\f509 F.3d 1278, 1284 (10th Cir. 2007) (citations and quotations omitted).\n\nAccording to the factual scenario upon which the district court based its rejection\n\nof Barrientos’s claim to qualified immunity, which this court lacks the authority\n\nto review, Barrientos fired six shots into a suspect who was “no longer able to\n\ncontrol the vehicle, to escape, or to fire a long gun, and thus, may no longer have\n\npresented a danger to the public, Deputy Barrientos, or other responding\n\nofficers.” Mem. Op. & Order at 30. Prior to shooting Dominguez, Barrientos\n\n“stepped back, felt safer, and noticed Mr. Dominguez slump.” Id. This allowed\n\nhim “enough time . . . to recognize and react to the changed circumstances and\n\ncease firing his gun.” Id. Under these circumstances, we have no trouble\n\nconcluding Barrientos lacked probable cause to believe Dominguez posed a threat\n\nof serious harm to Barrientos or others at the time he fired shots two through\n\nseven. Garner, 471 U.S. at 3, 11 (“Where the suspect poses no immediate threat\n\nto the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend\n\nhim does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.”). We further have no\n\ntrouble concluding a reasonable officer in Barrientos’s position would have\n\nknown that firing shots two through seven was unlawful. Casey, 509 F.3d at\n\n1284. Accordingly, the district court, in evaluating Barrientos’s assertion of\n\nqualified immunity, did not err in concluding Barrientos violated clearly\n\nestablished law when he fired shots two through seven.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fIV.   Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\f",

Introduction\n\n      Defendant Johnny Barrientos, a deputy of the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment, appeals the district court’s denial of his motion for summary\n\njudgment in a 28 U.S.C. § 1983 action brought by Lucia Fancher, individually and\n\non behalf of the estate of her son, Nick Dominguez. Fancher alleges Barrientos\n\nused excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he shot\n\nDominguez seven times following a confrontation in Mesquite, New Mexico.\n\nDominguez died as a result of one or more gunshot wounds. Barrientos asserts he\n\nis entitled to qualified immunity because his use of deadly force was objectively\n\nreasonable and did not violate clearly established law. The district court granted\n\nBarrientos’s motion for summary judgment to the extent Fancher’s claim arose\n\nfrom the firing of the initial shot, but denied the motion to the extent the claim\n\narose from the firing of the subsequent six shots.\n\n      On appeal, Barrientos makes three arguments. First, he asserts the district\n\ncourt erred in analyzing the second through seventh shots separately from the first\n\nshot. Next, he argues the district court did not sufficiently consider the risks\n\nposed to third parties in analyzing the reasonableness of shots two through seven.\n\nFinally, he argues the law was not clearly established that his actions violated the\n\nFourth Amendment. This court lacks jurisdiction to consider the first two\n\narguments, and is unpersuaded by the third. Thus, exercising jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fpursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court affirms the denial of summary judgment\n\nby the district court. 1\n\nII.    Background\n\n       Because, when reviewing the denial of a summary judgment motion\n\nasserting qualified immunity, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court’s\n\nconclusions as to what facts the plaintiffs may be able to prove at trial, Fogarty v.\n\nGallegos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170599\"><a href=\"/opinion/170599/fogarty-v-gallegos/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1154 (10th Cir. 2008); see also supra Part III.A., we\n\nrestate the district court’s account of the relevant factual background here:\n\n               On March 29, 2010, at approximately 5:41 p.m., Deputy\n       Barrientos responded to a reported theft of two 20-packs of bottled\n       Budweiser beer from the Mesquite Mercantile in Mesquite, New\n       Mexico. There was no report that the suspects were armed or\n       threatening. Deputy Barrientos was on duty, in full uniform with his\n       badge displayed, and driving a marked patrol vehicle. Defendant\n       Barrientos was issued two patrol rifles, but his squad car was\n       equipped with only one lock for one of the rifles. He had the assault\n       rifle in the front seat of his car . . . .\n\n              Upon arrival at the Mercantile, Deputy Barrientos interviewed\n       a female clerk who told him that the manager in the back office had a\n       security camera video of the theft. Deputy Barrientos reviewed the\n       video, which showed a male in a white shirt and blue jeans at the\n\n\n       1\n        Fancher’s complaint also includes claims against Sheriff Todd Garrison in\nhis individual and official capacities as well as the County of Doña Ana.\nAlthough all defendants filed the notice of appeal, the only issues raised relate to\nthe denial of qualified immunity to Barrientos. Sheriff Garrison did not claim\nentitlement to qualified immunity and the county is not entitled to qualified\nimmunity, Starkey ex rel. A.B. v. Boulder Cnty. Soc. Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172351\"><a href=\"/opinion/172351/starkey-ex-rel-ab-v-boulder-county-soc-serv/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1263\nn.4 (10th Cir. 2009) (“Qualified immunity . . . is available only in suits against\nofficials sued in their personal capacities, not in suits against governmental\nentities or officials sued in their official capacities.”).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      counter, and a second male wearing a black jacket and black pants\n      moving quickly across the screen. The clerk told Deputy Barrientos\n      that the individual at the counter was named Michael and might live\n      in a trailer near Highway 192.\n\n             Deputy Barrientos began searching the property outside the\n      Mercantile when police dispatch advised him at approximately 6:02\n      p.m. of a trespass involving two vehicles and several subjects\n      drinking at the Helena Chemical plant, across the road from the\nMercantile. While proceeding to the plant, Deputy Barrientos observed a male\nwearing a white shirt and blue jeans riding a bicycle down an alley. Deputy\nBarrientos stopped the bicyclist for questioning at approximately 6:06 p.m.\nDeputy Barrientos identified the bicyclist as an older man named Carlos\nCeniceros, who informed him that he knew where the individuals who stole the\nbeer were and that they were near a red car.\n\n             As Deputy Barrientos interviewed Mr. Ceniceros, a man from a\n      nearby house approached them and stated that the suspects were in\n      the area of an irrigation canal by a tree. Deputy Barrientos began\n      searching for the suspects, driving his patrol vehicle northbound on\n      the east side of a large irrigation canal accessible from Highway 192.\n      He spotted a red car turn onto the west side of the canal driving\n      northbound. Believing that the red car was associated with the theft\n      at the Mercantile, Deputy Barrientos activated his emergency\n      equipment and initiated a traffic stop at approximately 6:18 p.m. The\n      red car yielded at a tree near the intersection of the large irrigation\n      canal and a smaller canal.\n\n             Deputy Barrientos’s practice and training are to leave the\n      patrol vehicle running with the emergency equipment engaged during\n      traffic stops. The window was down to facilitate his visual search of\n      the area. The squad car was parked facing north on a clearing of\n      hard dirt.\n\n             Deputy Barrientos approached and questioned the driver who\n      remained in the car. Because the driver was a man in his late fifties\n      and the sole occupant of the vehicle, Deputy Barrientos concluded\n      that he was not involved in the theft and released him.\n\n            Immediately after the red car drove off, Deputy Barrientos\n      observed Mr. Ceniceros seated on the ground across the large canal\n\n                                        -4-\n\fto the northeast. Deputy Barrientos had not moved from where he\nhad been standing beside the driver’s door of the red car. He walked\ntoward Mr. Ceniceros to question him further about the suspects.\nThere was a water pipe spanning the large canal which allowed foot\ntraffic to move from one side to the other. When asked about the\nsuspects’ location, Mr. Ceniceros said he did not know, but indicated\nbehind Deputy Barrientos with his eyes and by nodding.\n\n       Just then, Deputy Barrientos heard a noise behind him and\nturned around to see that a beer bottle had landed near him. The\nbottle landed between 10 to 15 feet away from him. In his\nexperience, a bottle can be used as a weapon. He was still unable to\nsee the suspects.\n\n       Because the thrown beer bottle indicated someone was hiding\nand he did not know who it was or what was going on, Deputy\nBarrientos drew his weapon and walked toward a large irrigation\npump in order to see behind it. Using a tactical maneuver that he\nwas trained to use, Deputy Barrientos moved around the pump in an\nattempt to expose the suspects while maintaining a safe distance.\nDeputy Barrientos saw two young men and a young woman hiding in\na depression on the far side of a steel I-beam that served as a\nfoundation for the pump. Deputy Barrientos recognized one of the\nyoung men who wore a white shirt and blue jeans, later identified as\nMichael Herrera, from the Mercantile security video. Deputy\nBarrientos also recognized his own cousin, Valerie Gonzalez, and\nwas concerned that she might try to harm him because she had gang\naffiliations and had previously made negative comments about the\nfact that Deputy Barrientos was a law enforcement officer. The\nsecond young man, wearing black pants without a shirt, was later\nidentified as Nick Dominguez. Nick Dominguez was 17 years of age\nat the time.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos notified dispatch at 6:21 p.m. that he had\nthree suspects at gun point. He then commanded the subjects to\nshow their hands. Mr. Herrera complied while remaining on his\nknees. Ms. Gonzalez also complied. Mr. Dominguez, however,\nremained crouched on the ground concealing his hands, which\nconcerned Deputy Barrientos because he feared that the suspects\ncould have weapons concealed in their clothing. Mr. Dominguez’s\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffailure to comply prevented Deputy Barrientos from frisking the\nsuspects to this point.\n\n      Deputy Barrientos commanded Ms. Gonzalez to step over the\nI-beam and lie down, and she complied. Mr. Herrera remained on his\nknees and kept his hands raised. Deputy Barrientos ordered Mr.\nDominguez to move closer to him and to step over the I-beam and lie\ndown next to Ms. Gonzalez. After refusing to comply with several\ncommands, Mr. Dominguez stepped over the I-beam but did not lie\ndown as instructed. Instead, Mr. Dominguez moved toward Deputy\nBarrientos in three motions, asking “right here?” each time. Mr.\nDominguez moved within a couple of feet of Deputy Barrientos.\nDeputy Barrientos again ordered Mr. Dominguez to lie down, but\ninstead he dropped to one knee and then suddenly lunged at Deputy\nBarrientos, grabbing his duty weapon with both hands.\n\n       As the two men struggled, Mr. Dominguez yelled to the other\nsuspects to run away. Deputy Barrientos again commanded Mr.\nDominguez to release his weapon and get on the ground but he did\nnot comply. During the struggle, Ms. Gonzalez remained prone on\nthe ground with her head and shoulders toward Deputy Barrientos\nand Mr. Dominguez, while Mr. Herrera remained on his knees. Both\nsuspects were just a few feet away from the struggle.\n\n       The men fell to their knees with Mr. Dominguez on Deputy\nBarrientos’s left side. The weapon discharged into the ground and\nmalfunctioned. The discharge concerned Deputy Barrientos because\nthe bullet could have struck himself, Ms. Gonzalez, or Mr. Herrera,\nwho were both just a few feet away; Mr. Ceniceros, who was a few\nyards away; or an occupant at one of the residences across the field.\nAfter the weapon discharged, Mr. Dominguez continued trying to\ntake it away from Deputy Barrientos. Deputy Barrientos forced the\nweapon’s barrel into the dirt and then drew his taser.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos tasered Mr. Dominguez in the back.\nAlthough the taser deployed, it did not work. Mr. Dominguez then\nlet go of the gun, pushed free from the struggle, and fled directly\ntoward the patrol vehicle, jumping over the smaller irrigation canal.\nDeputy Barrientos saw that the malfunction was a so-called “stove\npipe” jam, where the spent shell casing lodges in the ejection port\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fand prevents the weapon from firing. He quickly cleared the\nmalfunction and ran after Mr. Dominguez.\n\n       Mr. Dominguez entered the driver’s side of the patrol vehicle\njust as Deputy Barrientos caught up to him. At that moment, Deputy\nBarrientos was aware that Mr. Dominguez had just tried to take his\nduty weapon away from him and that there were two loaded long\nguns in the vehicle. Deputy Barrientos believed that a round fired\nfrom one of the long guns, an AR-15 assault rifle, could have struck\na nearby residence.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos quickly approached the patrol vehicle and,\nwith his duty weapon in his right hand, tried to remove the ignition\nkeys with his left hand while shouting at Mr. Dominguez to stop and\nget out of the vehicle. Mr. Dominguez pushed Deputy Barrientos’s\nleft hand away, resisting his attempt to remove the ignition keys.\nThe engine was racing. As Deputy Barrientos struggled to remove\nthe ignition keys, Mr. Dominguez shifted the patrol vehicle into\nreverse.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos fired his duty weapon at Mr. Dominguez’s\ncenter mass, or chest area. He began firing his weapon before the\nvehicle started going backwards. Deputy Barrientos was sure that he\nhad hit Mr. Dominguez with the initial shot to the chest because he\nsaw him slump.\n\n       After firing his weapon, the car began to press up against his\nshoulder. He could feel the car pushing him away and turning him to\nthe right. Deputy Barrientos testified that he took two or three steps\naway from the car after the first shot. He testified that he felt safer\nafter he backed away from the vehicle. The squad car continued to\nmove in reverse, away from Deputy Barrientos. He nevertheless\ncontinued shooting at Mr. Dominguez after he had moved backwards\nthose two to three steps, even though he did not at that time have any\nindication that Mr. Dominguez was armed.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos fired seven shots. Mr. Herrera heard a\nperiod of silence between two separate rounds of gunfire. He heard a\nseries of gunshots, followed by five to seven seconds in which he did\nnot hear any gunshots, followed by the sound of two more gunshots.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f       Mr. Ceniceros saw Deputy Barrientos fire shots at Mr.\nDominguez while he was in the car. Immediately after Deputy\nBarrientos fired the last shot, Mr. Ceniceros saw Deputy Barrientos\nat a distance of between eight to ten feet from the side of the squad\ncar.\n\n       Deputy Barrientos testified that, if his long gun had not been\nin the car, he likely would not have shot Mr. Dominguez. Although\nhe had mace on him at the time he first shot Mr. Dominguez and was\nwithin range to use it, Deputy Barrientos did not consider using it\ninstead of deadly force. Deputy Barrientos was sure that firing his\nweapon effectively eliminated any threat posed by Mr. Dominguez.\nAt 6:22 p.m., Deputy Barrientos notified dispatch that the subject\nwas down.\n\n....\n\n       New Mexico State Police Agent Norman Rhoades was\nassigned to be the “crime scene manager” of the crime scene in this\ncase. Based on Deputy Barrientos’s initial statement describing\nevents and evidence at the crime scene, Agent Rhoades prepared\ncrime scene diagrams. The diagrams show that the squad car moved\nin a backwards arc from its initial position and came to a stop at the\nend of its backward arc in a field of weeds and fine sand. Based on\nhis investigation, Agent Rhoades determined that, when Mr.\nDominguez was behind the wheel of the squad car, the car only\nmoved in reverse away from Deputy Barrientos.\n\n       Agent Rhoades indicated in the diagrams that a shot into the\nchest through the heart was “Possibly 2nd shot;” the shot into the\nupper left front seat backrest was “Possibly 3rd shot;” the shot into\nthe upper left front door was “Possibly 4th shot;” and the shot into\nthe lower left front door was “Possibly 5th shot.” Agent Rhoades\nacknowledged, though, that the sequences 2 through 5 in the\ndiagrams “could be altered as far as the sequence goes.” He\nexplained that, for example, wound C could have just as likely been\ncaused by shot 2, 3, 4, or 5. The diagrams further state: “Possibly\n6th shot, into upper left front door striking both arms,” and “Possibly\n7th shot, striking suspect’s head.” Agent Rhoades acknowledged that\nshots 6 and 7 could be re-sequenced.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fMem. Op. & Order at 1–10 (citations omitted).\n\n      Fancher brought suit under 28 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging Barrientos’s use of\n\ndeadly force against Dominguez was unreasonable and violated the Fourth\n\nAmendment. Barrientos moved for summary judgment, arguing he was entitled to\n\nqualified immunity because his use of deadly force was objectively reasonable as\n\na matter of law. Relying heavily on Thomas v. Durastanti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147900\"><a href=\"/opinion/147900/thomas-v-durastanti/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 665\n\n(10th Cir. 2010), the district court concluded Barrientos did not violate\n\nDominguez’s constitutional rights by firing the first shot because his reaction to a\n\nviolent, fleeing felon was objectively reasonable. Alternatively, the court\n\nconcluded it was not clearly established at the time of the shooting that\n\nBarrientos’s firing of the first shot was unlawful. The district court also\n\nconcluded, however, that multiple unresolved factual issues precluded summary\n\njudgment as to the firing of the remaining shots:\n\n      Deputy Barrientos testified that he saw Mr. Dominguez slump after\n      the first shot. He also testified that, after the first shot, he stepped\n      away from the car, and thus, was not in immediate danger of being\n      run over with the vehicle, which was moving backwards away from\n      him. Significantly, Deputy Barrientos testified that he felt safer after\n      having taken those steps away from the vehicle. Additionally,\n      Deputy Barrientos’s testimony indicated that Mr. Dominguez was not\n      reaching for the long guns in the vehicle after the first shot.\n\n             A jury could construe Mr. Dominguez’s slumping as an\n      indication that he was no longer able to control the vehicle, to\n      escape, or to fire a long gun, and thus, may no longer have presented\n      a danger to the public, Deputy Barrientos, or other responding\n      officers. Moreover, a jury could also reasonably construe Deputy\n      Barrientos’s testimony that he did not fire the second shot until after\n\n                                         -9-\n\f       he stepped back, felt safer, and noticed Mr. Dominguez slump as\n       indicating that enough time passed between the first and second shots\n       for Deputy Barrientos to recognize and react to the changed\n       circumstances and cease firing his gun. There is thus a question of\n       fact as to whether, under the totality of circumstances, Deputy\n       Barrientos reasonably perceived that he or others were in danger at\n       the precise moments that he fired shots two through seven, and thus,\n       whether those additional shots were excessive.\n\nMem. Op. & Order at 30. The court therefore denied qualified immunity to\n\nBarrientos as to shots two through seven. This appeal followed.\n\nIII.   Discussion\n\n       A.    Jurisdiction 2 and Standard of Review\n\n       This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to review “all final\n\ndecisions of the district courts of the United States.” Ordinarily, an order denying\n\nsummary judgment is not a “final decision” within the meaning of § 1291.\n\nAllstate Sweeping, LLC v.

Thus, in reviewing the\n\ndistrict court’s rejection of Barrientos’s qualified immunity defense, “we must\n\nscrupulously avoid second-guessing the district court’s determinations regarding\n\nwhether [Fancher] has presented evidence sufficient to survive summary\n\njudgment.” Clanton v.

If the district\ncourt does not “identify the particular charged conduct that it deemed adequately\nsupported by the record, we may look behind the order denying summary\njudgment and review the entire record de novo to determine for ourselves as a\nmatter of law which factual inferences a reasonable jury could and could not\nmake.” Lewis v.

Finally, this court “need not\ndefer to the district court’s assessment of the reasonable factual inferences that\narise from a complaint at the motion to dismiss stage.” Id. at 1226. The first and\nthird of these exceptions are plainly inapplicable, and Barrientos has not\nadvanced an argument in support of the second.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fRichardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158503\"><a href=\"/opinion/158503/dodds-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1192 (10th Cir. 2010). “When a defendant asserts\n\nqualified immunity at summary judgment, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to\n\nshow that: (1) the defendant violated a constitutional right and (2) the\n\nconstitutional right was clearly established.” Martinez v.

Barrientos’s Assertion of Qualified Immunity\n\n      1.     “Segmented” Analysis\n\n      Barrientos first argues the district court erred in analyzing shots two\n\nthrough seven separately from the first shot. Barrientos nominally frames this\n\nargument as a legal issue, asserting that segregating the shots as the district court\n\ndid constitutes a “misapplication of the totality of the circumstances standard”\n\nwhich is applied when analyzing excessive force claims. See Graham v. Connor,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (1989) (holding that determining whether force was excessive\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment “requires careful attention to the facts and\n\ncircumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue,\n\nwhether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or\n\nothers, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by\n\nflight”); Tennessee v. Garner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111397\"><a href=\"/opinion/111397/tennessee-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1985) (holding deadly force may not\n\nbe used “to prevent the escape of an apparently unarmed suspected felon . . .\n\nunless it is necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to\n\nbelieve that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical\n\n                                         -12-\n\finjury to the officer or others”). Ultimately, however, Barrientos’s argument\n\ndepends upon a challenge to the facts the district court concluded a reasonable\n\njury could infer based upon the evidence in the summary judgment record. For\n\nexample, Barrientos asserts the district court’s use of a segmented approach was\n\nerror “when the facts of the incident are that Barrientos and the public were\n\nplaced in danger from the moment he was attacked by the decedent until the time\n\nthat Barrientos was completely sure that neither he nor the public were in further\n\ndanger.” Appellant’s Br. at 19 (emphasis added).\n\n      The district court relied on Thomas for the proposition that “circumstances\n\nmay change within seconds eliminating the justification for deadly force.” 607\n\nF.3d at 666; accord Waterman v. Batton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788742\"><a href=\"/opinion/788742/michael-r-waterman-personal-representative-of-the-estate-of-josh-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 (4th Cir. 2005) (“We\n\ntherefore hold that force justified at the beginning of an encounter is not justified\n\neven seconds later if the justification for the initial force has been eliminated.”).\n\nBarrientos does not take issue with the district court’s reliance on Thomas or\n\nWaterman as an abstract legal matter, i.e., he does not argue it is never\n\nappropriate in an incident involving the firing of multiple shots by a police officer\n\nto analyze the shots separately if the circumstances so warrant. Instead,\n\nBarrientos strenuously argues that the circumstances of this case are not amenable\n\nto such analysis. Specifically, he argues that, unlike the situation in Waterman,\n\n“the threat of harm caused by the decedent to Barrientos and to nearby community\n\nmembers existed for the duration of the approximately ninety . . . second\n\n                                         -13-\n\fincident.” Appellant’s Br. at 22. The district court, however, concluded the\n\nevidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to draw a contrary inference:\n\n      Although in some circumstances multiple shots fired in a matter of\n      seconds should be grouped together in the qualified immunity\n      analysis, this case is different. Here, there is evidence that Deputy\n      Barrientos had time between the first shot and the following shots to\n      take a few steps back to get out of the way of the car, to assess the\n      situation, and to know that Mr. Dominguez had slumped and may not\n      have presented a continuing danger to himself or to the public.\n\nMem. Op. & Order at 16. Because Barrientos’s first argument on appeal cannot\n\nreasonably be understood as anything other than an attack on these conclusions of\n\nthe district court, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. Fogarty, 523 F.3d at\n\n1154; Clanton, 129 F.3d at 1153.\n\n      2.     Danger to Third Parties\n\n      Barrientos’s second argument on appeal is similarly unreviewable.\n\nBarrientos argues the district court did not consider the risk posed to third parties\n\nin applying the segmented approach. In support of this argument Barrientos lists\n\nseveral material facts which he alleges the district court failed to consider when\n\nanalyzing whether Dominguez posed a continuing threat after the first shot.\n\nBarrientos goes on to argue that these facts should have led the district court to\n\nconclude that he “could not reasonably have known that [Dominguez] was\n\nsufficiently subdued such that he no longer presented a threat to the officer or the\n\ncommunity when Deputy Barrientos fired shots two through seven.” Id. at 25.\n\nAgain, Barrientos’s argument amounts to nothing more than a request for review\n\n                                         -14-\n\fof the “factual conclusions” of the district court, a task which exceeds the scope\n\nof our jurisdiction on interlocutory review of the denial of qualified immunity.\n\nFogarty, 523 F.3d at 1154.\n\n      3.     Clearly Established Law\n\n      Unlike Barrientos’s first two arguments, his third presents no jurisdictional\n\ndifficulties. Whether a constitutional right was clearly established at the time an\n\nalleged violation occurred is a “quintessential” example of a purely legal\n\ndetermination fit for interlocutory review. Garrett v. Stratman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161239\"><a href=\"/opinion/161239/garrett-v-stratman/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 952\n\nn.8 (10th Cir. 2001). Nonetheless, in light of the facts we must assume to be true\n\nat this stage of the proceedings, we readily conclude Barrientos’s argument is\n\nwithout merit. In Casey v. City of Federal Heights, this court discussed the\n\n“clearly established” standard in the context of excessive force claims:\n\n      Ordinarily . . . for a rule to be clearly established there must be a\n      Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit decision on point, or the clearly\n      established weight of authority from other courts must have found\n      the law to be as the plaintiff maintains. However, because excessive\n      force jurisprudence requires an all-things-considered inquiry with\n      “careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular\n      case,” Graham, 490 U.S. at 396, there will almost never be a\n      previously published opinion involving exactly the same\n      circumstances. We cannot find qualified immunity wherever we\n      have a new fact pattern. Indeed, the Supreme Court has warned that\n      “officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established\n      law even in novel factual circumstances.” Hope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n      <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (2002). The Hope decision shifted the qualified immunity\n      analysis from a scavenger hunt for prior cases with precisely the\n      same facts toward the more relevant inquiry of whether the law put\n      officials on fair notice that the described conduct was\n      unconstitutional.\n\n                                         -15-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170063\"><a href=\"/opinion/170063/casey-v-city-of-federal-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1284 (10th Cir. 2007) (citations and quotations omitted).\n\nAccording to the factual scenario upon which the district court based its rejection\n\nof Barrientos’s claim to qualified immunity, which this court lacks the authority\n\nto review, Barrientos fired six shots into a suspect who was “no longer able to\n\ncontrol the vehicle, to escape, or to fire a long gun, and thus, may no longer have\n\npresented a danger to the public, Deputy Barrientos, or other responding\n\nofficers.” Mem. Op. & Order at 30. Prior to shooting Dominguez, Barrientos\n\n“stepped back, felt safer, and noticed Mr. Dominguez slump.” Id. This allowed\n\nhim “enough time . . . to recognize and react to the changed circumstances and\n\ncease firing his gun.” Id. Under these circumstances, we have no trouble\n\nconcluding Barrientos lacked probable cause to believe Dominguez posed a threat\n\nof serious harm to Barrientos or others at the time he fired shots two through\n\nseven. Garner, 471 U.S. at 3, 11 (“Where the suspect poses no immediate threat\n\nto the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend\n\nhim does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.”). We further have no\n\ntrouble concluding a reasonable officer in Barrientos’s position would have\n\nknown that firing shots two through seven was unlawful. Casey, 509 F.3d at\n\n1284. Accordingly, the district court, in evaluating Barrientos’s assertion of\n\nqualified immunity, did not err in concluding Barrientos violated clearly\n\nestablished law when he fired shots two through seven.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fIV.   Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\f</pre>",
