INTRODUCTION\n\n       At first glance, this case places the Court in the unenviable position of either standing in\n\nthe way of residential redevelopment or jeopardizing the homes of families who depend on the\n\nstatus quo. Defendants are several companies planning to redevelop their existing apartment\n\ncomplex into a more modern development with many more one- and two-bedroom units.\n\nPlaintiffs are a nonprofit organization and two tenants, purporting to represent a class, who\n\ncontend that Defendants’ elimination of many three-, four-, and five-bedroom apartments in the\n\nprocess will disproportionately impact families in violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act and\n\na comparable District of Columbia statute. Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief on the\n\ngrounds that they face imminent irreparable harm if Defendants proceed with their\n\nredevelopment plan. Defendants counter that any of the alleged injuries would not occur until\n\nyears down the road. They also move to dismiss on several procedural grounds, and because\n\nPlaintiffs “cherry-pick” a narrow demographic—“large families”—from the entirety of the class\n\nprotected under the FHA—families—and focus only on the destruction of certain apartments and\n\fnot the construction of many more. Because Defendants’ procedural arguments are flawed and\n\nPlaintiffs do not cherry-pick data, the Court will deny the Motion to Dismiss. Because Plaintiffs\n\ndo not adequately show that the threatened injuries are imminent, the Court will deny the Motion\n\nfor a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n\n                                II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n                                         A. Complaint1\n\n       Defendants Brentwood Associates, L.P.,2 Mid-City Financial Corporation, and\n\nEdgewood Management Corporation are owners of an affordable housing development located\n\nin Northeast D.C. See Compl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 2. They are in the process of redeveloping their\n\ndeteriorating 75-year-old buildings, in part by increasing the total number of units but decreasing\n\nthe number of larger-sized apartments. See District of Columbia Zoning Commission, Order No.\n\n14-18, Case No. 14-18 at 33 (Mid-City Fin. Corp.) (Sept. 10, 2015), available at ECF No. 4-18\n\n[hereinafter Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18];3 Compl. ¶¶ 4–5. Their redevelopment plan\n\n\n       1\n          Because the Court considers different information when analyzing a motion to dismiss\nthan it does with a motion for a preliminary injunction, the relevant facts are divided into two\nsections.\n       2\n         Per stipulation, Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed the case against Defendant\nBrentwood Village, LLC, because Brentwood Village does not have an ownership interest in the\nproperty subject to the suit. See Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, ECF No. 12.\n       3\n          With respect to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, the Court takes judicial notice of the\nfacts in the District of Columbia Zoning Commission proceeding involving Defendants and their\nproposed redevelopment only to “avoid unnecessary proceedings when an undisputed fact on the\npublic record makes it clear that the plaintiff does not state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted.” Covad Commc’ns Co. v. Bell Atl. Corp., 407 F.3d 1220, 1222 (D.C. Cir. 2005)\n(internal citation and quotations omitted). The Court takes into account only uncontested facts,\nand does not “review[] the entire record,” which would require conversion of the Motion to\nDismiss into a motion for summary judgment. See Marshall Cty. Health Care Auth. v. Shalala,\n988 F.2d 1221, 1228 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Mikva, C.J., dissenting). Plaintiffs never dispute\nDefendants’ invocation of the Zoning Commission’s order as a basis for its factual claims. See\ngenerally Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 21 (Plaintiffs even specifically\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fcalls for the elimination of 113 four-bedroom and 21 five-bedroom apartment units. See Compl.\n\n¶¶ 32, 46. In light of social, economic, and practical considerations, the D.C. Zoning\n\nCommission agreed with Defendants that, like in other developments nationwide, it would not be\n\neconomical to build four- and five-bedroom units. See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at\n\n52, 56. The plan also calls for the decrease of three-bedroom apartments from 75 to 64 units.\n\nCompl. ¶ 47. In all, the redevelopment would decrease the number of three-, four-, and five-\n\nbedroom apartments from 209 to 64. Id. ¶ 5. It would also displace at least 119 households—the\n\nmajority of which are families—currently residing at Brookland Manor. Id. ¶¶ 50–53, 75. Even\n\nthe remaining three-bedroom apartments might not be affordable, “further reducing the available\n\nhousing for larger families.” Id. ¶ 52. Defendant Mid-City’s Vice President Michael Meers\n\ntestified before the D.C. Zoning Commission that “all residents in good standing shall have the\n\nopportunity to return to the redeveloped property . . . [a]nd when relocations do occur[,]\n\nownership will pay for all packing and moving expenses.” Id. ¶ 54.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that the redevelopment plan would have a disparate impact on families.\n\nSee id. ¶¶ 69–79. Among the 486 occupied units at Brookland Manor, 253 (52%) are occupied\n\nby “families” that Plaintiffs claim are within the relevant statutory definitions, which the\n\nComplaint defines as “those who have one or more minor children living in the household.” See\n\nid. ¶ 72. Of the 303 one- and two- bedroom apartments, only 104 (34%) are occupied by\n\nfamilies, as defined by Plaintiffs. Id. ¶ 74. Of the 183 three-, four-, and five-bedroom units, 149\n\n(81%) are occupied by families. Id. Taken together, 149 families—comprising 59% of families\n\noverall—are at risk of displacement because of the development, compared to only 34 non-\n\n\n\n\nstate that they “are not challenging the Zoning Comission’s approval of Mid-City’s stage-one\nPUD application”).\n\n\n                                                  3\n\ffamilies—15% overall. Id. ¶ 77. The new development would contain about 1,760 units,\n\nincluding 1,646 apartments. Id. ¶¶ 48. There are currently around 535 apartment units at\n\nBrookland. See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at 7.\n\n       Individual Plaintiffs—Ms. Adriann Borum and Ms. Loretta Holloman—allege that\n\nredevelopment would force them out of their homes and subject them to multiple forms of injury.\n\nSee Compl. ¶¶ 80–107. Ms. Borum lives in a four-bedroom apartment unit with her five\n\nchildren, who range in age from 7 to 21. Id. ¶¶ 94–95. She and her children depend on the local\n\ncommunity for academic, religious, and recreational support. Id. ¶¶ 97–101. If the family is\n\ninvoluntarily displaced, “Ms. Borum will have an extremely difficult time finding an\n\nadequately[-]sized apartment in D.C. for her family because of the scarcity of affordable housing\n\nof her unit type.” Id. ¶ 105. Ms. Holloman lives with her mother, brother, and three school-aged\n\nchildren in a four-bedroom Brookland Manor apartment. Id. ¶¶ 80–81. Her brother and one of\n\nher children are both autistic and attend a special-needs programs—one for children and one for\n\nadults—in the community. Id. ¶ 82–83. She too will have a difficult time finding a replacement\n\napartment for her family, may have to move outside of D.C., and will lose the irreplaceable\n\ncommunity on which she and her family depend. See id. ¶¶ 82–91.\n\n       Individual Plaintiffs bring this case on behalf of themselves and “all others similarly\n\nsituated” including “[a]ll households who reside or have resided at Brookland Manor in a three-,\n\nfour-, or five-bedroom unit with one or more minor child,” and who have either been displaced\n\nor are at risk of being displaced by Defendants’ proposed redevelopment project. See id. ¶ 122.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that at least 149 families are in the Proposed Class, and that the redevelopment\n\nwill have “the same impact on all class members.” Id. ¶¶ 125–27. According to Plaintiffs, all\n\nmembers of the Proposed Class are interested in the case because the redevelopment project\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fsignificantly decreases the amount of available housing suitable for families, would have a\n\ndisparate impact on families, and may have been motivated by a discriminatory purpose. See id.\n\n¶ 127. Moreover, Plaintiffs argue, a single injunction would afford the primary relief that\n\nmembers of the Proposed Class seek. Id. ¶ 137.\n\n       The final Plaintiff, community organization ONE DC, is “comprised of members who\n\ninclude tenants of affordable housing properties that are seeking to avoid displacement, preserve\n\naffordable housing, ensure fair housing, and further equitable development in D.C.” Id. ¶ 108.\n\nONE DC seeks this injunction “on its own behalf and as a representatives of its members,\n\nincluding members who are residents of Brookland Manor and have minor children.” Id. ¶ 109.\n\nIt further asserts that Defendants’ conduct has directly “damaged ONE DC by frustrating its\n\nmission of creating and preserving racial and economic equity in D.C. for all and by causing\n\nONE DC to divert scarce organizational resources,” particularly given that the organization has\n\nonly two fulltime staff members. See id. ¶¶ 111–12. As a result of Defendants’ actions, ONE\n\nDC diverted its resources from its mission to “crisis organizing” through “identifying,\n\ninvestigating, and combating Defendants’ discriminatory policies and practices, and to\n\ncounseling, organizing, and reassuring tenants who have been forcibly moved or have feared\n\nimminent displacement under Defendants’ proposed redevelopment plan.” Id. ¶ 113, 118. For\n\nexample, after hearing about the proposed redevelopment, ONE DC organized a series of\n\n“Outreach Days.” Id. ¶¶ 114–16. In all, ONE DC alleges that, as of July 28, 2016, it had spent\n\n640 staff-hours on “combat[ing] Defendants’ discriminatory conduct.” Id. ¶ 121.\n\n       To implement their redevelopment, Defendants have petitioned the D.C. Zoning\n\nCommission through the “planned unit development (PUD) process.” See id. ¶ 43; D.C. Mun.\n\nRegs. tit. 11-X, § 300. In October, 2014, Defendants submitted an application for a First-Stage\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fPUD and Related Zoning Map Amendment (“First-Stage PUD”) with the D.C. Zoning\n\nCommission. Compl. ¶ 44; see generally D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11-X, § 302. The Zoning\n\nCommission approved the First-Stage PUD application in June, 2015, and its order became final\n\non November 6, 2015. Compl. ¶ 56. Now, Defendants have filed a Second-Stage PUD\n\napplication, the approval of which would allow Defendants to begin redevelopment and\n\ndestruction of Plaintiffs’ apartments. See Pl. Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at\n\n17–18, ECF No. 20; Compl. ¶ 57.\n\n       During the course of the redevelopment process, Defendants made comments that\n\nPlaintiffs allege are discriminatory. See Compl. ¶ 59. In a December 2014 letter to the\n\nBrookland Manor Residents Association, Defendant Mid-City stated that four- and five-bedroom\n\napartments are “not an ideal housing type for larger families and there are adverse impacts on the\n\nremainder of the community.” Id. ¶ 61. The following month, Mid-City said that there would\n\nnot be four- or five-bedroom units because they are “not consistent with the creation of a vibrant\n\nnew community.” Id. ¶ 62. Then, in an April 2015 hearing in front of the Zoning Commission,\n\nDefendant Mid-City, representing Brentwood Village, said that “[c]ommunities and\n\norganizations throughout the country are in agreement that housing very large families in\n\napartment complexes is significantly impactful upon the quality of life of households as well as\n\ntheir surrounding neighbors. Therefore, [Defendants do] not propose to construct four or five\n\nbedroom units in the project.” Id. ¶ 60.\n\n       Plaintiffs now allege that Defendants violated the Federal Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) by\n\nundertaking the redevelopment project that will disproportionately reduce the amount of\n\napartments available for families, which they allege constitutes discrimination on the basis of\n\nfamilial status. See id. ¶¶ 140–50. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants violated the District\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fof Columbia Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”) on similar grounds. See id. ¶¶ 151–62. Plaintiffs\n\nmake separate claims under both statutes alleging discriminatory statements, because of\n\nDefendants’ statements suggesting that housing for large families is incompatible with the\n\ncommunity they seek to create. See id. ¶¶ 163–78. Defendants do not aim the Motion to\n\nDismiss at Plaintiffs’ claims about these alleged statements.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ Complaint seeks certification of a class, a judgment declaring that the\n\nproposed plan’s decrease of the number of units available for certain families violates the FHA\n\nand DCHRA, “any and all injunctive relief that the Court may deem appropriate,” compensatory\n\nand punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. See Prayer for Relief, Compl. at 35–36.\n\n                            B. Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n\n        In addition to the above allegations, Plaintiffs and Defendants each put forward evidence\n\nfor consideration of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n                                      1. Plaintiffs’ Evidence\n\n       Plaintiffs put forth evidence that they argue shows that Plaintiffs face threats of injury if\n\nthe redevelopment project proceeds. They submit a statement from Defendants to the Zoning\n\nCommission confirming the numerical allegations in the Complaint. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of\n\nMot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 12, ECF No. 4-13. To digest the redevelopment plan in numerical\n\nterms, they also submit the declaration of a social-statistician, Dr. Andrew Beveridge. See Pls.’\n\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 1 (“Beveridge Decl.”), ¶ 9, ECF No. 4-2. Based on\n\nhis analysis of the redevelopment plans, he states that “families would be more than four times as\n\nlikely as non-families to be adversely affected by the planned redevelopment because 58.9[%] of\n\nthe families at Brookland Manor live in three-, four-, or five-bedroom units . . . [and] [i]n\n\ncontrast, only 14.6[%] of non-families live in such . . . units.” See id. ¶ 9. Dr. Beveridge further\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fasserts that families will face difficulty finding new housing, or, for the few families that might\n\nbe able to remain at Brookland, overcrowding. See id. ¶¶ 10–11.\n\n        Individual Plaintiffs assert specific injuries that they will suffer if Defendants carry out\n\nthe redevelopment. Ms. Holloman claims in a declaration that she and her family will “suffer\n\ndisplacement,” and leave her along with her “aging mother, brother with special needs, and three\n\nminor children with nowhere to go.” See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 5\n\n(“Holloman Decl.”), ¶ 9(a), ECF No. 4-6. She predicates this assertion on her “strong[] belie[f]\n\nthat [she] will be unable to find housing that will accommodate [her] family’s size and special\n\nneeds” within the community and at an affordable price. See id. ¶ 9(a)(i). She specifically\n\nworries that her mother will be unable to continue her “essential” career training classes, her\n\nbrother will lose his “essential” special-needs program, her autistic son will lose his “crucial”\n\nspecial needs classes, her other children will lose their local schooling, and the whole family will\n\nlose its community connections. See id. ¶¶ 9(a)(i)–(vi). Ultimately, she is “concerned that [her]\n\nfamily could be forcibly broken up,” leaving her separated from her children. See id. ¶ 9(b). In\n\naddition to the toll moving would take on her family, she claims she will suffer her own\n\nemotional distress. See id. ¶ 9(e). Ms. Borum similarly asserts that without a four-bedroom unit\n\nshe and her family cannot reside at Brookland, putting her family at risk of displacement or\n\nfragmentation. See Pl.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 4, ¶ 9(a), ECF No. 4-5. She\n\nclaims that she personally is “aware of” other families who have “been asked to leave the\n\nproperty” or been “broken up.” See id. ¶ 8. Like Ms. Holloman, Ms. Borum believes the\n\nredevelopment would make it impossible for her and her family to remain in the community.\n\nSee id. ¶ 9(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       To bolster their claims that Defendants’ redevelopment will displace or break apart\n\nfamilies, Plaintiffs submit second-hand declarations of people who claim they know of other\n\nfamilies who have been forced to relocate. See id. ¶ 8; Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim.\n\nInj. Ex. 9 (“McFadden Decl.”), ¶ 6, ECF No. 4-10 (declaration of tenant Reginald McFadden,\n\nwherein he asserts that he is “aware of other families who have already had to transfer to another\n\nunit . . . , had their families broken up into smaller units, or been asked to leave”); Pls.’ Mem. in\n\nSupp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 10 (“Scott Decl.”), ¶ 6, ECF No. 4-11 (declaration of tenant\n\nValarie Scott asserting the same); Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 8 (“Jenkins\n\nDecl.”), ¶ 6, ECF No. 4-9 (declaration of tenant Javon Jenkins asserting the same). Although\n\nPlaintiffs acknowledge that Defendants will allow families the right to return to Brookland, see\n\nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 15, at 3, ECF No. 4-16, they argue that families\n\ncannot do so without larger apartments, which are scarce in the District of Columbia, see Pls.’\n\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 2 (“Merrifield Decl.”), ¶ 27, ECF No. 4-3. Plaintiffs\n\nassert that families who rely on Section 8 vouchers to subsidize their rent payments will be\n\nparticularly affected by redevelopment, because units available to lower-earning households are\n\neven scarcer than they are for the general population. See Merrifield Decl., ¶¶ 18, 32–34.\n\n       Plaintiffs also produce evidence that they argue shows that the threatened injuries against\n\nPlaintiffs are imminent, if not occurring already. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim.\n\nInj., at 26, ECF No. 4. As noted above, several tenants argue that they know of families who\n\nhave been forcibly moved or separated by Defendants. More broadly, Plaintiffs argue that\n\n“Defendants will soon receive final approval of their proposed redevelopment.” See id. at 13.\n\nThe D.C. Zoning Commission gave first-stage PUD approval to Defendants’ redevelopment\n\nplan, and Defendants submitted an application for second-stage PUD approval weeks before it\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fwas due. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 17, ECF No. 4-18 (D.C. Zoning\n\nCommission approval); Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 2, ECF No. 20-2\n\n(Defendants’ stage-two application, dated September 20, 2016); Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to\n\nDismiss, at 9, ECF No. 16-1 (noting that Defendants were required to submit a stage-two\n\napplication by November 6, 2016). Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ early submission of the\n\nstage-two application shows just how quickly they intend to implement the redevelopment. See\n\nPls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 12. With Defendants’ submission of\n\nanother application for stage-two approval, the Zoning Commission can immediately consider\n\nthe proposal, and if the Commission gives approval, Defendants may begin redeveloping\n\nimmediately thereafter. See D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11-Z, § 702. At that point, Plaintiffs argue,\n\nthere will be no way to stop Defendants from inflicting irreparable injuries upon Plaintiffs. See\n\nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 14. Plaintiffs further argue that a recent filing\n\nwith the Zoning Commission shows that the first phase of redevelopment will affect a building\n\nthat is made up almost entirely of three- and four-bedroom units. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp.\n\nof Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 3, at 1, ECF No. 20-3.\n\n       To show that Defendants do not want “large families to reside on their property,” see\n\nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 15, Plaintiffs put forth statements made by\n\nDefendants in connection with the redevelopment project. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for\n\nPrelim. Inj. Ex. 12, at 6; Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 18, at 8, ECF No. 4-19.\n\nIn a submission to the Zoning Commission, Defendants stated that “housing very large families\n\nin apartment communities is significantly impactful upon the quality of life of households as well\n\nas their surrounding neighbors.” See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 12, at 6.\n\nThen, in response to a question from tenants, Defendants stated that they would “not build any\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fnew [four-bedroom] or [five-bedroom] apartment flats as our practical experience has\n\ndemonstrated that it is not an ideal housing type for larger families and there are adverse impacts\n\non the remainder of the community.” See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 18, at\n\n8.\n\n                                     2. Defendants’ Evidence\n\n       Defendants produce evidence telling a different story. According to Michael S. Meers,\n\nExecutive Vice President of Defendant Mid-City Financial Corporation, the redevelopment is an\n\ninnocuous response to two principal concerns. See Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex.\n\n1 (“Meers Aff.”), ¶ 1, ECF No. 18-1. First, “[t]he existing buildings are now 75 years old and\n\nare functionally obsolete with all of the major systems requiring replacement,” with the property\n\nlast having been renovated over 40 years ago. Id. ¶ 6. The District of Columbia Office of\n\nPlanning concurred with Defendants that “the buildings and the infrastructure [of Brookland] are\n\nnot optimally functional.” See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at 64. Second, “the urban\n\ndesign of the original community and buildings . . . has resulted in the property not being as\n\nsafe” as it could be because of crime. Meers Aff. ¶ 7. Mr. Meers attributes the “ongoing crime\n\nproblems” to the street configuration’s lack of conduciveness to “efficient pedestrian and\n\nvehicular access through the subject property,” resulting in a kind of isolation from the\n\nsurrounding community. See id. In addition, Defendants plan to provide many more homes for\n\nall—regardless of familial status—by expanding the existing 535 apartment units to 1,760 total\n\nunits, including 1,646 apartments. See id. ¶ 8, 10. The Zoning Commission agreed with\n\nDefendants that including larger units would be impractical. See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case\n\n14-18, at 52, 56. As for the families who claim to require larger units, Defendants indirectly\n\ninvoke a study purportedly showing that several Brookland tenants currently reside in apartments\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fthat are too big for their respective occupants, based on “the HUD guidelines of two persons per\n\nbedroom,” so that only “13 exiting households would require four bedrooms and no household\n\nwould require five bedrooms.” See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at 38. The Zoning\n\nCommission favorably cited the D.C. Office of Planning as having considered this information\n\nprior to stage-one PUD approval, see id. at 35–38, but neither the HUD guidelines nor the study\n\nare themselves in the record. The Office of Planning also found that Defendant planned to\n\nmaintain “[t]he building with the larger units . . . until the later phases at which time they can be\n\n‘right sized’ to accommodate larger families.” See id. at 38.\n\n       Defendants emphasize that any displacement of tenants would not occur until years down\n\nthe road, during later phases of the redevelopment project. See Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for\n\nPrelim. Inj., at 6, ECF No. 18. Defendants plan to implement the redevelopment project in three\n\nphases. See id. During “Phase One” in late 2017, three of the current 19 buildings that\n\nconstitute Brookland Manor will be replaced by 28 for-sale units and 200 senior-citizen units.\n\nSee Meers Aff. ¶ 17. These buildings are called “Block 7.” See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case\n\n14-18, at 50. All residents in those three buildings will be “relocated at ownership expense to an\n\nappropriate apartment home on the property.” Id. Some tenants have been moved, but “[n]o\n\ntenant in [the three affected buildings] has been forced to move outside the development as a\n\nresult of any failure to accommodate that tenant elsewhere in the development.” See Meers Aff.\n\n¶ 17. Because Defendants would need the units created by Phase One to relocate tenants, Phase\n\nTwo and Phase Three will not begin until 2019. See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at\n\n50. Individual Plaintiffs would not need to vacate during Phase One. Defendants do not\n\nanticipate forcing Ms. Borum to relocate until “at least 2020” or forcing Ms. Holloman to\n\nrelocate “until 2023.” Meers Aff. ¶¶ 18–19 (also declaring that any communication concerning\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\frelocation “will not happen until the year 2020 at the earliest for Plaintiff Borum, and the year\n\n2023 at the earliest for Plaintiff Holloman”). The record does not show that any of the affiants\n\nthat Plaintiffs cite in their motion, see Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 10, will be\n\nrequired to move away from Brookland as a result of the redevelopment until after Phase One.\n\nSee generally Meers Aff.; Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 2 (“Sanquist Aff.”), ¶ 6,\n\nECF No. 18-2.\n\n       If a preliminary injunction were to be granted, Defendants argue, they would be severely\n\nharmed. “Based on the Zoning Commission’s approval, Mid-City has subsequently expended\n\nsignificant capital on architecture, landscaping, engineering, legal services[,] and financing\n\nopportunities in anticipation of . . . construction phasing outlined in the approved PUD.” Meers\n\nAff. ¶ 23. Not only will this mean that Defendants “would suffer enormous financial harm,” but\n\nit might mean that they would be unable to build the additional units and “be forced to re-\n\nevaluate the commitment to voluntarily retain the Section 8 contract that assists 373 very-low\n\nincome families in the District of Columbia.” Id. ¶ 24. In fact, “[i]n the case of delay, Mid-City\n\ncould be forced to leave the aging property ‘as is’ and convert the existing units to true\n\nunrestricted market rate units.” Id.\n\n\n                                          III. ANALYSIS\n\n       Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction. In the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction,\n\nPlaintiffs move for the Court to enjoin Defendants from submitting a second-stage PUD\n\napplication. See Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 3. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs request “any\n\nand all injunctive relief that the Court may deem appropriate, including entering a preliminary . .\n\n. injunction ordering Defendants to . . . cease violating” Plaintiffs’ rights under the Federal Fair\n\nHousing Act and District of Columbia Human Rights Act. See Prayer for Relief, Compl. at 35–\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f36. After Plaintiffs filed their Complaint and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Defendants\n\nsubmitted a second-stage PUD application, see Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim.\n\nInj. Ex. 2, making the specific request in Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction moot.\n\nNonetheless, the Court considers Plaintiffs’ request for an appropriate preliminary injunction to\n\nremedy their injuries.4\n\n       Using a theory of disparate impact, Plaintiffs argue that the redevelopment plan “will\n\neffectively eliminate housing for the majority of large families at the Brookland Manor\n\nproperty,” and that without a preliminary injunction, “it is almost certain that the nearly 150\n\nfamilies now resident at Brookland Manor will lose their housing during the pendency of this\n\nlitigation.” See Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 1. Defendants oppose a preliminary injunction,\n\narguing that the alleged injuries are not imminent, Plaintiffs are unlikely to be successful on the\n\nmerits, and that preliminarily enjoining the redevelopment would significantly harm Defendants\n\nand the public.5 See generally Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj.\n\n       Defendants move to dismiss on a number of grounds. They advance four procedural\n\narguments: first, that Plaintiffs did not exhaust their administrative remedies through the zoning\n\n\n\n       4\n            In their Reply Memorandum, Plaintiffs assert that they “now modify the requested form\nof relief and seek to enjoin Defendants from taking any action towards residents meant to\neffectuate their challenged redevelopment plan, including relocating tenants on or off the\nproperty, evicting, moving, or otherwise bringing about the cessation of tenancy in preparation\nfor . . . redevelopment.” Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 18, ECF No. 20.\nPlaintiffs did not move to amend their request for a preliminary injunction. However, because\nthese are possible “appropriate” forms of a preliminary injunction meant to preserve Plaintiffs’\nrights, the Court will consider them with respect to any preliminary injunction it might issue.\n       5\n          Defendants previously argued that Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction preventing the filing\nof a second-stage PUD application would have violated the United States Constitution because it\nwould block access to the Zoning Commission and constitute a prior restraint. See Defs.’ Opp’n\nto Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 11–13. As Plaintiffs acknowledge, because Defendants already\nsubmitted their application, the Court is unable to impose such an injunction, making the\nargument moot. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 17–18.\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fprocess, so principles of “‘res judicata’ and/or collateral estoppel” preclude relief; second, that\n\nthe Court does not have jurisdiction under the Rooker–Feldman doctrine, because review would\n\nconstitute an appeal of a state-administrative proceeding; third, that the Court should dismiss on\n\nYounger abstention grounds, because the case involves important D.C. matters; and fourth, that\n\nONE DC lacks standing. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 9–10. In the\n\nsubstantive realm, Defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs impermissibly\n\ncherry-pick the scope of both the protected class and alleged discriminatory action.\n\n        The Court will first address Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, then move to Plaintiffs’\n\nMotion for a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n                                A. Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss\n\n        Defendants’ arguments concerning exhaustion, Younger abstention, and Plaintiffs’ data\n\ninterpretation are non-jurisdictional in nature and ask the Court to determine whether Plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint states a cognizable claim. See William Penn Apartments v. D.C. Court of Appeals, 39\n\nF. Supp. 3d 11, 19 (D.D.C. 2014) (analyzing Younger abstention in the context of a 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion instead of a 12(b)(1) motion); Johnson v. District of Columbia, 368 F. Supp. 2d 30, 36\n\n(D.D.C. 2005), aff’d, 552 F.3d 806 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (noting that “in cases where state courts\n\nproperly treat a state administrative exhaustion requirement as a matter of subject matter\n\njurisdiction . . . similar jurisdictional status for that state-law exhaustion requirement in federal\n\ncourts will not be theoretically justified”). To survive such a motion a complaint must contain\n\nsufficient factual allegations that, if accepted as true, would state a plausible claim to relief.\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of\n\naction, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id. Instead, plaintiffs must\n\n“nudge[] their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.” See Bell Atl. Corp. v.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). “In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court\n\nmay consider the facts alleged in the complaint, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated\n\nby reference in the complaint, or documents upon which the plaintiff’s complaint necessarily\n\nrelies even if the document is produced not by the parties.” Busby v. Capital One, N.A., 932 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 114, 133–34 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n          In contrast, Defendants’ Rooker–Feldman and standing arguments concern whether the\n\nCourt has subject-matter jurisdiction over the case at all. See Bradley v. DeWine, 55 F. Supp. 3d\n\n31, 41 (D.D.C. 2014) (Rooker–Feldman doctrine); Cheeks v. Fort Myer Const. Co., 722 F. Supp.\n\n2d 93, 108 (D.D.C. 2010) (standing). Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and the\n\nlaw presumes that “a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction.” Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466,\n\n489 (2004) (quoting Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994)); see\n\nalso Gen. Motors Corp. v. EPA, 363 F.3d 442, 448 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“As a court of limited\n\njurisdiction, we begin, and end, with an examination of our jurisdiction.”). Thus, it is the\n\nplaintiff’s burden to establish that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction. See Lujan v. Defs. of\n\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). When considering whether it has jurisdiction, a court must\n\naccept “the allegations of the complaint as true.” Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham, 798 F.3d\n\n1119, 1129 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Herbert v. Nat’l Acad. of Scis., 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1992)).\n\n          The Court will analyze Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss using these standards, beginning\n\nfirst with Defendants’ procedural arguments before moving to their argument that Plaintiffs do\n\nnot state a cognizable claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f                                             1. Exhaustion\n\n        Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs knew about the Zoning Commission proceedings\n\nbut did not choose to challenge the proposed redevelopment, both their FHA and DCHRA claims\n\nare barred by the doctrines of exhaustion and preclusion. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to\n\nDismiss, at 18–19. The Court will address Defendants’ argument starting with an analysis of the\n\nFHA before moving to the DCHRA.\n\n                                             Fair Housing Act\n\n        Although Defendants do not bifurcate their analysis of exhaustion, the Court will begin\n\nwith federal law. In support of their exhaustion argument, Defendants invoke Auger v. D.C.\n\nBoard of Appeals & Review, a District of Columbia Court of Appeals case, where the plaintiff\n\nsought review “of his administrative appeal from the District of Columbia’s imminent\n\nenforcement of an order revoking his permit for a neon sign atop his hotel” and a preliminary\n\ninjunction prohibiting authorities from removing the sign. See 477 A.2d 196, 199 (D.C. 1984).\n\nIn Auger, the plaintiff did not administratively appeal his case, despite notice and an opportunity\n\nto do so. See id. at 206. As a result of the plaintiff’s failure to exhaust, the District of Columbia\n\ncourts did not have jurisdiction over the action. See id. at 207. Defendants further note that\n\nparties alleging injury from a Zoning Commission order can appeal their case to the D.C. Court\n\nof Appeals. See D.C. Library Renaissance Project/W. End Library Advisory Grp. v. D.C. Zoning\n\nComm’n, 73 A.3d 107, 119 (D.C. 2013); see also York Apartments Tenants Ass’n v. D.C. Zoning\n\nComm’n, 856 A.2d 1079, 1081 (D.C. 2004).\n\n        Under 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A), “[a]n aggrieved person may commence a civil action\n\nin a[] . . . court . . . to obtain appropriate relief with respect to . . . [a] discriminatory housing\n\npractice or breach.” Thus, a plaintiff filing under § 3613 “may proceed directly into federal\n\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\fcourt, deferring neither to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development nor to state\n\nadministrative and judicial processes.” Gladstone Realtors v. Vill. of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 125\n\n(1979). Congress “carefully chose[] language” allowing immediate judicial recourse to\n\nindividuals “directly victimized by a discriminatory housing practice.” Id. at 125–26. The fact\n\nthat Plaintiffs had District of Columbia administrative remedies available is irrelevant. As\n\nPlaintiffs argue, to require individuals seeking relief from an imminent violation of their federal\n\nrights to proceed through state-level administrative or judicial avenues would defeat the\n\npurpose—as evinced from the “carefully chosen language” of the statute—of the remedy that\n\nCongress provided. See id. at 125. The FHA “would be seriously undercut if Section 812\n\nactions were conditioned upon prior exhaustion of state administrative remedies.” Huntington\n\nBranch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Town of Huntington, N.Y., 689 F.2d 391, 393 n.3 (2d Cir. 1982)\n\n(analyzing state-level administrative zoning remedies). Defendants cite cases analyzing the\n\nprocesses governing appeals of unfavorable District of Columbia zoning restrictions generally—\n\nbut not in the context of the violation of federal rights. See Auger, 477 A.2d at 200 (appeal of\n\nthe denial of a permit to place a neon sign atop the plaintiff’s hotel); Capitol Hill Restoration\n\nSoc. v. Zoning Comm’n, 287 A.2d 101, 102 (D.C. 1972) (appeal of a zoning application to build\n\nan office building); C. Library Renaissance Project/W. End Library Advisory Grp., 73 A.3d at\n\n111 (appealing “certain zoning requirements”); York Apartments Tenants Ass’n, 856 A.2d at\n\n1081 (appealing an application to modify a PUD on procedural grounds). Because Plaintiffs\n\nseek relief from alleged discrimination, Defendants’ cases are inapposite and Plaintiffs’ FHA\n\nclaims are not barred for failure to exhaust.\n\n       Throughout their argument on exhaustion, Defendants invoke concepts of claim\n\npreclusion and issue preclusion, so the Court will address them separately. Defendants argue\n\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fthat “Plaintiffs’ [indirect] challenge . . . to the Zoning Order is barred by jurisprudence on the\n\npreclusive effect of state administrative agency orders on later-filed [f]ederal claims involving\n\nmatters decided in agency adjudicative proceedings.” See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to\n\nDismiss, at 24. Defendants cite to Univ. of Tennessee v. Elliott, a case in which the Supreme\n\nCourt reasoned that it saw “no reason to suppose that Congress, in enacting the Reconstruction\n\ncivil rights statutes, wished to foreclose the adaptation of traditional principles of preclusion to\n\nsuch subsequent developments as the burgeoning use of administrative adjudication in the 20th\n\ncentury.” See 478 U.S. 788, 797 (1986). Even putting aside the technical requirements of claim\n\nand issue preclusion, Elliott is not controlling here. Unlike in that case, where there was “no\n\nreason to suppose that Congress” intended to foreclose preclusion, as noted above, Congress\n\n“carefully chose[]” to allow plaintiffs to “proceed directly into federal court” to vindicate their\n\nfederal rights. Gladstone Realtors, 441 U.S. at 125–26. This shows that “Congress did not\n\nintend for administrative determinations . . . whether issued by [federal] or certified state\n\nagencies, to preclude aggrieved parties from seeking vindication of their rights through civil\n\nactions.” United States v. E. River Hous. Corp., 90 F. Supp. 3d 118, 146 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).\n\nThus, “it would make little sense to give res judicata effect to a proceeding,” Miller v. Poretsky,\n\n409 F. Supp. 837, 838 (D.D.C. 1976), whether federal or state, under the FHA. See id.; E. River\n\nHous. Corp., 90 F. Supp. 3d at 146. Accordingly, the Zoning Commission’s findings do not\n\nhave preclusive effect over Plaintiffs’ FHA claims.\n\n       But even if Congress did intend for state-level administrative proceedings to have\n\npreclusive effect, the Court could not give such an effect here. Both claim and issue preclusion\n\nrequire a ruling by “a court of competent jurisdiction.” See Smalls v. United States, 471 F.3d\n\n186, 192 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (claim preclusion); Yamaha Corp. of Am. v. United States, 961 F.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f245, 254 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (issue preclusion). The D.C. Zoning Commission has power to\n\n“regulate the location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of buildings . . ., the percentage of\n\nlot which may be occupied, the sizes of yards . . . and other open spaces, the density of\n\npopulation, and the uses of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residence,\n\nrecreation, public activities, or other purposes.”6 D.C. Code § 6-641.01. Although the\n\nCommission does have the power to ensure that zoning regulations are consistent with the\n\nDistrict of Columbia’s “comprehensive plan,” see Tenley & Cleveland Park Emergency Comm.\n\nv. D.C. Bd. of Zoning Adjustment, 550 A.2d 331, 332 (D.C. 1988), which, according to\n\nDefendants, is “a broad framework intended to guide the future land use planning decisions for\n\nthe District of Columbia,” see Defs.’ Reply to Pls.’ Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss, at 15, ECF No. 24,\n\nthe Zoning Commission has no power to implement the plan. Tenley & Cleveland Park\n\nEmergency Comm., 550 A.2d at 341 n.22. Because DC’s “broad framework” is not comparable\n\nto the Federal FHA and Defendants do not identify any power to independently review private\n\nFHA violations,7 there is no indication that the District of Columbia Zoning Commission could\n\nbe considered a “competent” “court” for purposes of reviewing FHA claims.\n\n\n       6\n          Defendants contend that this is not the proper provision providing the Zoning\nCommission with its powers. See Defs.’ Reply to Pls.’ Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss, at 15, ECF\nNo. 24. They cite part (a) of D.C. Code § 6-621.01 for the proposition that the Zoning\nCommission has general power “[t]o protect the public health, secure the public safety, and to\nprotect property.” See id. However, after this clause follows: “there is created a Zoning\nCommission.” See D.C. Code § 6-621.01(a). Then, part (e), which grants the Commission its\npower, provides that “[t]he Zoning Commission shall exercise all the powers . . . with respect to\nzoning . . . as provided by law.” See D.C. Code § 6-621.01(e) (emphasis added). So, although\npart (a) outlines broad purposes for creating a Zoning Commission, it does not by itself grant\npower.\n       7\n         In their reply memorandum, Defendants assert that a footnote of a D.C. District Court\n“not[ed] that the Zoning Commission may find that regulations governing community-based\nresidential facilities are violative of the FHA.” See Defs.’ Reply to Pls.’ Opp’n to Mot. to\nDismiss, at 15. In fact, this is not the case, at least using any meaningful definition of the word\n“find.” That footnote quoted the Zoning Commission as simply stating that a regulation “could\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f                                        D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n       Defendants also seek dismissal of the DCHRA count on exhaustion grounds. Similar to\n\nthe FHA, the DCHRA provides that “[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory practice shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for\n\ndamages and such other remedies as may be appropriate, unless such person has filed a[n\n\nadministrative] complaint.” D.C. Code § 2-1403.16(a); see also Williams v. District of\n\nColumbia, 467 A.2d 140, 141 (D.C. 1983) (noting that the DCHRA provides “direct resort to the\n\ncourts,” but holding that government employees must exhaust administrative remedies in some\n\ncases). The plain language of the DCHRA commands the same finding as the language of the\n\nFHA. Because the Court is one of “competent jurisdiction” and Plaintiffs claim to be “aggrieved\n\nby an unlawful discriminatory practice” under the DCHRA, Plaintiffs did not need to exhaust\n\nany District of Columbia administrative remedies. Given the arguably stronger language in the\n\nD.C. statute (“[a]ny person . . . shall have a cause of action”), this reasoning applies equally to\n\nissues of preclusion here. Moreover, there is no indication that the District of Columbia Zoning\n\nCommission is a competent “court” to review such a claim. The Court will not give preclusive\n\neffects to any findings by the Zoning Commission.\n\n                                 2. The Rooker–Feldman Doctrine\n\n       The Court next considers Defendants’ argument that the Court lacks subject-matter\n\njurisdiction to consider this matter under the Rooker–Feldman doctrine. Defendants argue that\n\nreview of this case would functionally constitute an appeal of a state-level judgment. “The\n\nRooker–Feldman doctrine . . . is confined to . . . cases brought by state-court losers complaining\n\n\n\nbe subject to challenge under the provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act,” not ruling on\nit substantively. See Cmty. Hous. Tr. v. Dep’t of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs, 257 F. Supp.\n2d 208, 223 n.18 (D.D.C. 2003).\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fof injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings\n\ncommenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.” Exxon Mobil\n\nCorp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 284 (2005). The doctrine is rooted in the\n\nSupreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments granted by Congress. See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1257. In D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, the Supreme Court “held that this grant of\n\njurisdiction is exclusive.” Lance v. Dennis, 546 U.S. 459, 463 (2006); see also D.C. Court of\n\nAppeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 482 (1983). The doctrine is named after Feldman and the\n\nonly other case where the Supreme Court has “applied this rule to find that a Federal District\n\nCourt lacked jurisdiction,” Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923). See Lance, 546\n\nU.S. at 463. In Rooker, the plaintiff sought Supreme Court review of an Indiana Supreme Court\n\ndecision. Id. When the Supreme Court declined review, the plaintiff filed an action in a federal\n\ndistrict court. Id. The Supreme Court “viewed the action as tantamount to an appeal of the\n\nIndiana Supreme Court decision, over which only [the Supreme] Court had jurisdiction, and said\n\nthat the ‘aggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no longer can do\n\ndirectly.’” Id. (quoting Rooker, 263 U.S. at 416). Sixty years later in Feldman, the Court\n\napplied the same reasoning to a District of Columbia Court of Appeals decision refusing\n\nadmission to a bar applicant. Id. The Supreme Court emphasized the difference between a\n\njudicial decision and an administrative one, holding that “to the extent plaintiffs challenged the\n\nCourt of Appeals decisions themselves—as opposed to the bar admission rules promulgated\n\nnonjudicially by the Court of Appeals—their sole avenue of review was with this Court.” Id.\n\n“Neither Rooker nor Feldman elaborated a rationale for a wide-reaching bar on the jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fof lower federal courts, and [Supreme Court] cases since Feldman have tended to emphasize the\n\nnarrowness of the Rooker–Feldman rule.”8 Id. at 464.\n\n       As Defendants candidly point out, see Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 25,\n\nthe Supreme Court has held that “[t]he doctrine has no application to judicial review of executive\n\naction, including determinations made by a state administrative agency.” Verizon Maryland, Inc.\n\nv. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 535 U.S. 635, 644 n.3 (2002). Defendants attempt to distinguish Verizon\n\nMaryland by arguing that “not all federal courts have confined the scope of that remark to the\n\nspecific factual scenario addressed in that decision,” citing an unpublished Central District of\n\nCalifornia case, Reiner v. California Dep’t of Indus. Relations. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of\n\nMot. to Dismiss, at 25. (citing No. 12-8649, 2012 WL 7145706, (C.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2012),\n\nreport and recommendation adopted, 2013 WL 571797 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2013), aff’d sub nom.\n\nReiner v. California, 612 F. App’x 473 (9th Cir. 2015)). In Reiner, the plaintiff sought review of\n\ndeterminations made in a state-level workers’ compensation appeal board and “state tribunals.”\n\nSee 2012 WL 7145706, at *2. In finding that the Rooker–Feldman doctrine applied, the\n\nMagistrate Judge emphasized that the case was based primarily on state law, not federal law as in\n\nVerizon Maryland, and that the party in Reiner had actually filed a state-level claim previously,\n\nunlike in Verizon Maryland. See id. at *3.\n\n       Given that the Rooker–Feldman doctrine is “narrow and focused,” Thana v. Board of\n\nLicense Comm’rs, 827 F.3d 314, 319 (4th Cir. 2016), the Court is not inclined to go against the\n\nblack-letter of Verizon Maryland that “[t]he doctrine has no application to judicial review of\n\n\n       8\n         Courts and scholars alike emphasize that the Supreme Court has trended toward\nnarrowing the doctrine since Feldman, particularly in Lance. See, e.g., Thana v. Board of License\nComm’rs, 827 F.3d 314, 319–20 (4th Cir. 2016) (calling the doctrine “narrow and focused”);\nSamuel Bray, Rooker Feldman (1923–2006), 9 Green Bag 2d 317 (2006) (mock obituary of the\ndoctrine).\n\n\n                                                23\n\fexecutive action, including determinations made by a state administrative agency.” 535 U.S. at\n\n644 n.3. But even if it were, this is not a case of “primarily . . . state law,” Reiner, 2012 WL\n\n7145706, at *3, and, as noted above, the Zoning Commission could not have substantively heard\n\nthese types of discrimination claims. This is a case of primarily federal law with the actions of a\n\nstate administrative agency looming in the background; in no way is the current action an appeal\n\nof the Zoning Commission’s order. Accordingly, Rooker–Feldman is inapplicable.\n\n                                      3. Younger Abstention\n\n       Defendants invoke the related doctrine of Younger abstention in support of their Motion\n\nto Dismiss. “In Younger v. Harris and its progeny, the Supreme Court held that, except in\n\nextraordinary circumstances, a federal court should not enjoin a pending state proceeding\n\n(including an administrative proceeding) that is judicial in nature and involves important state\n\ninterests.” JMM Corp. v. District of Columbia, 378 F.3d 1117, 1120 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The\n\ndoctrine stems from the equitable principle that “courts . . . should not act, and particularly\n\nshould not act to restrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party has an adequate remedy\n\nat law and will not suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable relief.” Younger v. Harris, 401\n\nU.S. 37, 43–44 (1971). At its core, Younger abstention stems from concerns of comity and\n\nfederalism and prevents federal courts from enjoining ongoing criminal prosecutions. See id.;\n\nsee also Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 73 (1971). Moving beyond the core of the doctrine,\n\nfederal courts also abstain in quasi-criminal contexts. Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592,\n\n604 (1975) (abstaining in a civil context because “the proceeding is both in aid of and closely\n\nrelated to criminal statutes which prohibit the dissemination of obscene materials”). The\n\nperiphery of the doctrine may encompass proceedings not in courts, but that are judicial in nature\n\nand concern important state interests. See New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fNew Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 364–73 (1989). The doctrine has even been applied to suits\n\nbetween two non-state parties where the underlying dispute concerned important state interests.\n\nSee, e.g., Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 17 (1987). In a case between private parties,\n\nfederal courts must abstain when (1) the relief sought would enjoin an ongoing state proceeding,\n\n(2) the state proceeding is judicial in nature, (3) “the state proceedings implicate important state\n\ninterests,” and (4) “the proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to raise the federal claims.”\n\nSee William Penn Apartments, 39 F. Supp. at 19 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n       The Court need not address all four requirements, because Defendants’ argument fails to\n\nestablish that the Zoning Commission proceedings “afford an adequate opportunity to raise the\n\nfederal claims.” Defendants argue that a D.C. Federal District Court has said that “[t]he Board\n\nof Zoning Adjustment ha[s] authority to consider reasonable accommodation request[s],”\n\nimplying that the board could consider such requests under the FHA. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp.\n\nof Mot. to Dismiss, at 29. In fact, that court suggested the opposite—although acknowledging\n\nthat the Board of Zoning Adjustment has the power to make a reasonable accommodation sua\n\nsponte under the “functional equivalent” of the FHA under D.C. regulations, the court explicitly\n\nstated that “the [DC Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs] is the body to whom a\n\nrequest for reasonable accommodation is properly lodged in the first instance.” See United\n\nStates v. District of Columbia, 538 F. Supp. 2d 211, 218 (D.D.C. 2008). The court cited 14\n\nD.C.M.R. § 111, which is entitled “Procedures Regarding Requests for Reasonable\n\nAccommodation Under the Fair Housing Act.” That regulation provides that “[a]ll requests for\n\nreasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act shall be submitted to the Director,\n\nDepartment of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs . . . or such office as the District may assign or\n\ndelegate.” 14 D.C.M.R. § 111.3. Similarly, here, as noted above in the Court’s discussion of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fissue and claim preclusion, the Zoning Commission is not a body empowered to hear FHA\n\nclaims. Thus, the Court will not abstain from addressing the merits of Plaintiffs’ federal claims.\n\n                                        4. ONE DC Standing\n\n        The Court next addresses Defendants’ argument that ONE DC—the community\n\norganization with some members who are residents of Brookland Manor with minor children, see\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 108–09—lacks standing to bring this matter. Defendants specifically argue that ONE\n\nDC lacks a sufficiently concrete injury-in-fact. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at\n\n31–35. “The Supreme Court has held that standing to bring an FHA claim is coextensive with\n\nconstitutional standing.” Nat’l Fair Hous. All., Inc. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 208 F. Supp.\n\n2d 46, 52 (D.D.C. 2002); see also Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 372 (1982).\n\nONE DC “bears the burden of establishing” its standing. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. “An\n\norganization can have standing on its own behalf . . . or on behalf of its members.” Abigail All.\n\nfor Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. Eschenbach, 469 F.3d 129, 132 (D.C. Cir. 2006)\n\n(internal citations omitted). Standing based on an organization’s own injury—“organizational\n\nstanding”—requires an organization, “like an individual plaintiff, to show actual or threatened\n\ninjury in fact that is fairly traceable to the alleged illegal action and likely to be redressed by a\n\nfavorable court decision.” Equal Rights Ctr. v. Post Properties, Inc., 633 F.3d 1136, 1138 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2011) (internal quotations omitted). For an organization to sue on behalf of its members\n\nthrough “associational standing,” it must show that (1) “its members would otherwise have\n\nstanding to sue in their own right,” (2) “the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the\n\norganization’s purpose,” and (3) “neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the\n\nparticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.” United Food & Commercial Workers Union\n\n\n\n\n                                                   26\n\fLocal 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 553 (1996) (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple\n\nAdvert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).\n\n       Plaintiffs assert that ONE DC has both organizational and associational standing.\n\nBecause the Court finds that ONE DC has organizational standing, it need not address the\n\nassociational standing issue. As noted above, organizational standing requires a concrete injury,\n\nnot “a mere setback to [the organization’s] abstract social interests.” See Equal Rights Ctr., 633\n\nF.3d at 1138 (internal citations and quotations omitted). “An organization’s expenditure of\n\nresources on a lawsuit does not constitute an injury in fact sufficient to establish standing.” Id.\n\nHowever, it is “clear . . . that if the defendant’s allegedly wrongful action prompts an\n\norganization to ‘increase[] the resources [it] must devote to programs independent of its suit’ . . .\n\n, the organization has shown an injury in fact.” Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Spann v.\n\nColonial Vill., Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). There is “an important limitation” on this\n\nprinciple: if an injury is “self-inflicted as a result of the organization’s own budgetary choices,”\n\nthe party cannot claim an injury-in-fact as a result of the defendant’s behavior. Id. at 1139\n\n(internal quotations omitted). This “does not automatically mean that [a party diverting\n\nresources] cannot suffer an injury sufficient to confer standing.” Id. at 1140. The crucial test for\n\ndetermining whether an injury is self-inflicted is whether the party “undertook the expenditures\n\nin response to, and to counteract, the effects of the defendants’ alleged discrimination rather than\n\nin anticipation of litigation.” Id. In the housing context, using resources for a program to\n\ncounteract a defendant’s discriminatory advertisement constitutes an adequate injury-in-fact,\n\nbecause it is used for the practical purpose of responding to allegedly illegal activity, not to\n\nprepare for litigation. See id. (citing Spann, 899 F.2d at 27–29). In Spann v. Colonial Village,\n\nInc., the plaintiff-organizations established standing when they alleged that the defendants’\n\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\f“preferential advertising tended to steer black home buyers and renters away from the advertised\n\ncomplexes,” requiring the plaintiffs to “devote more time, effort, and money to endeavors\n\ndesigned to educate not only home buyers and renters, but the DC area real estate industry.” 899\n\nF.2d at 27. So, if Defendants’ alleged actions frustrated ONE DC’s mission and ONE DC used\n\nresources to counteract that harm, it has standing to maintain the action. See Equal Rights Ctr.,\n\n633 F.3d at 1140.\n\n       Based on the facts alleged in the Complaint, ONE DC has standing to maintain this\n\naction. ONE DC is “comprised of members who include tenants of affordable housing\n\nproperties that are seeking to avoid displacement, preserve affordable housing, ensure fair\n\nhousing, and further equitable development in D.C.” Compl. ¶ 108. The alleged discrimination\n\nplainly frustrates ONE DC’s mission. Plaintiffs allege that ONE DC has had to divert its scarce\n\nresources away from its central mission to “crisis organizing” in the form of investigation,\n\ncounseling, organizing, canvassing, and other Brookland-specific programming. See id. ¶¶ 113–\n\n121. In all, Plaintiffs allege that, as of July 28, 2016, ONE DC has “diverted approximately 640\n\nhours of its staff members’ time to identify and combat Defendants’ discriminatory conduct\n\nthrough outreach, organizing, advocacy, and tenant counseling efforts.” Id. ¶ 121. This places\n\nONE DC’s case squarely within the holdings in Equal Rights Center and Spann. ONE DC did\n\nnot spend 640 hours concocting an injury in anticipation of litigation, but instead did so for the\n\npractical purpose of combating alleged discrimination in the community. Defendants’ alleged\n\ndiscrimination forced ONE DC to address an exigency in the community at the expense of its\n\nbroader social goals. Accordingly, ONE DC has sufficiently alleged organizational standing to\n\nwithstand Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f                            5. Failure to State Disparate Impact Claims\n\n       Defendants move to dismiss for failure to state a claim with respect to Plaintiffs’\n\ndisparate impact claims under the FHA and DCHRA. Defendants argue that Plaintiff\n\nerroneously assumes that “large families” are a protected group under the FHA, instead of the\n\nbroader protected class of “families.” Defendants further argue that without an FHA claim,\n\nPlaintiff cannot invoke supplemental jurisdiction to maintain its DCHRA claim. The Court will\n\naddress these arguments in turn.\n\n                                           Fair Housing Act\n\n       Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ FHA disparate impact claim for failure to state a\n\nclaim on the basis that Plaintiffs’ statistical analysis cherry-picks “large families” from the\n\nbroader “familial status,” and in so doing fails to analyze the effect that the entire redevelopment\n\nplan would have on all families that reside or will reside in the new community. See Defs.’\n\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 11–12.\n\n\n       The Federal FHA prohibits “mak[ing] unavailable . . . a dwelling to any person because\n\nof . . . familial status.” See 42 U.S.C. 3604(a). “‘Familial status’ means one or more individuals\n\n(who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with . . . a parent or another person\n\nhaving legal custody of such . . . individuals,” or the parent’s designee. 42 U.S.C. 3602(k). It is\n\nimportant to note that the FHA is generally a repository of negative rights—it does not\n\naffirmatively provide special privileges to parents living with minor children, but rather protects\n\nthem from discriminatory acts. See Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive\n\nCommunities Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2522 (2015) (“The FHA is not an instrument to force\n\nhousing authorities to reorder their priorities. Rather, the FHA aims to ensure that those priorities\n\ncan be achieved without arbitrarily creating discriminatory effects or perpetuating segregation.”).\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fFor example, the FHA does not entitle families to occupy units in excess of nondiscriminatory,\n\nreasonable occupancy requirements that apply to the population in general. Fair Hous.\n\nAdvocates Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Richmond Heights, Ohio, 209 F.3d 626, 636 (6th Cir. 2000); see\n\nalso City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc., 514 U.S. 725, 733 (1995) (contrasting\n\nimpermissible policies that target families with permissible policies that “apply uniformly to all\n\nresidents of all dwelling units”). It is also important to emphasize that the FHA only protects\n\nminor children domiciled with parents (or other such persons in a guardian role, as provided by\n\nthe statute). As Plaintiffs concede, see Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, at 8 n.4,\n\nECF No. 21, the sub-class of “large families” is not a protected class under the FHA. Debolt v.\n\nEspy, 832 F. Supp. 209, 215 (S.D. Ohio 1993), aff’d, 47 F.3d 777 (6th Cir. 1995) (“The Court\n\nnotes that as opposed to families in general, ‘large families’ are not a specifically protected class\n\nunder Title VIII.”); see also Fair Hous. Advocates Ass’n, Inc., 209 F.3d at 638 (concluding that\n\n“families of four, as opposed to families of three, are not protected classes”).\n\n\n       “[D]isparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act . . . .” Texas Dep’t\n\nof Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2518, 2525\n\n(2015). “To prevail on a disparate impact claim, a plaintiff must offer sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a finding that the challenged policy actually disproportionately affected a protected\n\nclass.” 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. District of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 681 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2006). The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has “[t]he authority and responsibility\n\nfor administering” the FHA. 42 U.S.C. § 3608(a); see also Mhany Mgmt., Inc. v. County of\n\nNassau, 819 F.3d 581, 618 (2d Cir. 2016). Part of that authority is the power to promulgate rules\n\n“to carry out” the FHA. See 42 U.S.C. § 3614a; see also Mhany Mgmt., Inc., 819 F.3d at 618.\n\nAccordingly, in line with the Second Circuit in Mhany Management, the Court “must defer to\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\f[HUD]’s reasonable interpretation” of the FHA with respect to its rules on disparate impact. See\n\n819 F.3d at 618 (citing Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837\n\n(1984)); accord Boykin v. Fenty, 650 F. App’x 42, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2016). HUD has adopted a\n\nburden-shifting framework for evaluating disparate impact claims. See 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c).\n\nFirst, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving that a challenged practice caused or predictably\n\nwill cause a discriminatory effect.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(1). Once the plaintiff makes such a\n\nshowing, the “defendant has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is necessary to\n\nachieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent or\n\ndefendant.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(2). If the defendant is able to do so, the “plaintiff may still\n\nprevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests supporting the\n\nchallenged practice could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.” 24\n\nC.F.R. § 100.500(c)(3).\n\n\n       To make an initial showing of disparate impact at “step one,” courts often rely on\n\nstatistical analyses. See, e.g., R.I. Comm’n for Human Rights v. Graul, 120 F. Supp. 3d 110,\n\n124–25 (D.R.I. 2015); Gashi v. Grubb & Ellis Prop. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 801 F. Supp. 2d 12, 16–\n\n17 (D. Conn. 2011). Such an analysis requires a plaintiff to “compar[e] those affected by the\n\npolicy with those unaffected by the policy.” See Gashi, 801 F. Supp. 2d at 16 (citing\n\nTsombanidis v. West Haven Fire Dep’t, 352 F.3d 565, 575–76 (2d Cir.2003)); accord Graul, 120\n\nF. Supp. 3d at 124 (internal citation and quotations omitted). In the “context . . . [of] housing\n\ndiscrimination, a wide enough contrast between the way a policy burdens members of a\n\nprotected group as opposed to non-members is cognizable as a disparate impact.” Graul, 120 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 125. In Gashi, the court found a 30.76% effect on households with children and a\n\n9.88% effect on households without children sufficient to constitute a disparate impact. See 801\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 16–17. In Graul, the court found a threefold difference sufficient. See 120 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 126.\n\n\n       Defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs have not made a showing at\n\nstep one of HUD’s framework, because, according to Defendants, Plaintiffs’ statistical analysis\n\ninappropriately focuses on a particular subset of the protected class—large families—and a\n\nparticular aspect of the redevelopment—the elimination of larger-occupancy apartments. See\n\nDefs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 11–18. The Court will address these two\n\ncontentions in turn.\n\n\n                            i.    “Familial Status” vs. “Large Families”\n\n\n       Defendants’ first qualm with Plaintiffs’ reasoning is that it relies on discrimination\n\nagainst large families rather than families as a protected group. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of\n\nMot. to Dismiss, at 9. As noted above, the FHA protects all families, as defined by statute,\n\nregardless of size. Courts have consistently assumed that “‘[f]amilial status’ refers to the\n\npresence of minor children in the household.” See Gilligan v. Jamco Dev. Corp., 108 F.3d 246,\n\n247 (9th Cir. 1997); see also Graul, 120 F. Supp. 3d at 125–26 (favorably citing methodology\n\ncomparing “households with children” and “households with no children”); United States v.\n\nBranella, 972 F. Supp. 294, 298 (D.N.J. 1997) (“Specifically, the FHAA provides that it is\n\nunlawful to make a dwelling unavailable to any prospective buyer or renter because of the\n\npresence of minor children in the prospective household.”). So, although there is no special\n\ntreatment for “large families” under the FHA, they are still protected under the umbrella of\n\n“families” if minors are in the household.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f       Although Plaintiffs do repeatedly refer to “large families” in their Complaint, their\n\nstatistical analysis specifically concerns “those who have one or more minor children living in\n\nthe household.” See Compl. ¶¶ 72, 37. Similarly, Plaintiffs define their proposed class as “[a]ll\n\nhouseholds who reside or have resided at Brookland Manor in a three-, four- or five[-]bedroom\n\nunit with one or more minor child.” See id. ¶ 122. Plaintiffs’ statistical analysis includes\n\napartments of all sizes, comparing those with minor children to those without them. See id. ¶ 75.\n\nUsing that metric, Plaintiffs arrive at the conclusion that the proposed redevelopment would\n\nadversely affect 59% of families overall, compared to 15% of nonfamilies. See id. ¶ 77. It does\n\nnot matter that many of the protected individuals are part of “large families” for the purpose of\n\nthe Complaint, so long as the unprotected group and protected group are correctly defined.\n\nBecause the Complaint shows that Plaintiffs do correctly define these groups, Plaintiffs did not\n\n“cherry-pick” protected families from the larger protected class.\n\n\n               ii.   The Elimination of Large Apartments vs. the Project as a Whole\n\n\n       Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs fail to take into account “all families that reside or\n\nwill reside in the revitalized community,” citing Boykin v. Gray. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of\n\nMot. to Dismiss, at 11 (second emphasis added). In Boykin, a group of homeless men claimed\n\nthat the District of Columbia’s closure of a particular homeless shelter violated the FHA, because\n\na disproportionate amount of the D.C. homeless population is black and Hispanic. See 986 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 14, 16 (D.D.C. 2013). The closure of the homeless shelter was part of a “broader shift\n\nin the District’s policy toward its homeless citizens” that had a net-positive impact on the\n\nminority population in the District. Id. at 21. Applying a disparate-impact standard, that court\n\nfound that “[t]he fundamental defect in the plaintiffs’ argument is that the adverse impact of\n\nwhich they complain was suffered not by the entire homeless population in the District of\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fColumbia, nor even by a significant portion of its more than 6,000 members.” See id. at 20.\n\nClosing the specific shelter affected 90 people, but the overall number of beds available to\n\nhomeless persons rose as a result of the District’s program. See id. at 20–21. By referring to “its\n\nhomeless citizens,” “the entire homeless population in the District of Columbia,” and “its 6,000\n\nmembers,” the above excerpts show that the court was interested in the District of Columbia’s\n\noverall universe of homeless persons.\n\n\n       In the context of a private landlord, courts are similarly concerned with the private\n\nparty’s universe of tenants. In Betsey v. Turtle Creek Associates, the tenants of a particular\n\nbuilding contended that a policy would have a disparate racial impact on them as individuals.\n\n736 F.2d 983, 985–87 (4th Cir. 1984). Because the plaintiffs did not show a “continuing\n\ndisproportionate impact,” a sufficient racial impact of the entire complex, or any impact on the\n\nlocal community, the district court dismissed the claim. See id. at 986–87. Reversing, the\n\nFourth Circuit held that “members of a discrete minority[] are required to prove only that a given\n\npolicy had a discriminatory impact on them as individuals.” Id. at 987. That court found\n\n“consideration of the rest of the local community, the rest of [the residential community], or even\n\nprospective applicants for space in [the building] irrelevant.” See id. (internal quotations\n\nomitted). “The correct inquiry is whether the policy in question had a disproportionate impact on\n\nthe minorities in the total group to which the policy was applied.” Id.\n\n\n       Here, it does not matter that the redevelopment might open up space for families in the\n\nlocal community to occupy smaller apartments at the redeveloped project. Defendants’ universe\n\nof persons are the existing tenants at Brookland Manor. If the current families of Brookland\n\nManor are disparately impacted by the redevelopment, it is irrelevant that some protected\n\npersons in the local community might end up filling their shoes in units that could not support\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fthem. Plaintiffs do analyze the effect that the entire project will have on all existing tenants of\n\nBrookland Manor. See Compl. ¶¶ 75–79. Given that Plaintiffs adequately allege that the\n\nproposed redevelopment project will affect Brookland Manor families over three times as much\n\nas it will nonfamilies, they state a claim.\n\n\n                                         D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n       Defendants’ only contention specific to the DCHRA is that “elimination of [Plaintiffs’]\n\nfederal claims would dictate dismissal of the rest of their claims as failing the test for\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction.” See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 18 n.7. Even if\n\ntrue, the Court simply notes that, as set forth above, it is not dismissing the federal-question\n\nclaims under the federal FHA, so supplemental jurisdiction remains.\n\n                       B. Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n\n       Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants from proceeding with\n\ntheir redevelopment plan.9 “To warrant preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must\n\nshow (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable\n\ninjury if the injunction were not granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure\n\nother interested parties, and (4) that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”\n\nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006). There\n\nmust be a showing of likely irreparable harm for a preliminary injunction to issue. Id.; see also\n\nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) (“Our frequently reiterated standard\n\nrequires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the\n\nabsence of an injunction.”). The D.C. Circuit “has set a high standard for irreparable injury,”\n\n\n\n\n       9\n           See supra note 4 and accompanying text.\n\n\n                                                  35\n\frequiring that the injury “be both certain and great,” and “actual and not theoretical.”\n\nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n“The moving party must show ‘[t]he injury complained of is of such imminence that there is a\n\n“clear and present” need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.’” Id. (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). To\n\nmeet the standard, “the harm must be so imminent as to be irreparable if a court waits until the\n\nend of trial to resolve the harm.” Rodriguez ex rel. Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 F.3d 227, 235\n\n(2d Cir. 1999). The moving party must also show that the threatened injury is “beyond\n\nremediation” with other forms of relief. See Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at\n\n297.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the threatened injuries are imminent, because when Defendants\n\nreceive Stage Two approval, they will be free to commence destruction of Plaintiffs’ homes. See\n\nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 26. Specifically, they argue that “D.C. Municipal\n\nRegulations make clear that second-stage approval is the final step before a redeveloper may\n\ncommence demolition.” See id. They further argue that Defendants have already required\n\nfamilies who reside in large units to “relocate, break up, and downsize.” See id. In support of\n\ntheir assertion, Plaintiffs cite to several declarations of tenants who claim to know others at\n\nBrookland Manor who have been forced to move. See id. at 27; McFadden Decl. ¶ 6; Jenkins\n\nDecl. ¶ 6; Scott Decl. ¶ 6. However, they do not cite to any first-hand account of a family who\n\nhas been forced to relocate off the property, nor any family who has been told they will need to\n\nrelocate but will be unable to do so on the property.10\n\n\n\n       10\n           Plaintiffs’ argument that a recent submission to the Zoning Commission shows that the\nfirst block to be demolished contains almost all three- and four-bedroom apartments is\nunavailing. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for a Prelim. Inj., at 13, ECF No. 20. If, as\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f       Defendants argue that any displacement would not occur until years in the future. See\n\nDefs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 6. Michael Meers, Vice President of Defendant\n\nMid-City Financial Corporation, has stated that demolition will not commence until late 2017, at\n\nthe earliest, because of the length of time it takes to receive Stage Two approval and then obtain\n\nthe requisite permits to begin the project. See Meers Aff. ¶ 17. Moreover, because the existing\n\nbuildings are collateral on a HUD loan until August 1, 2017, it is “highly unlikely” that\n\nDefendants could begin demolition any earlier.11 See id. ¶ 21. Even then, the project will be\n\nlimited to “Phase One,” meaning that only three of the 19 buildings will be demolished. See id.\n\n¶ 17. Later phases will not begin until 2019, and neither individual Plaintiff will need to vacate\n\nuntil 2020, at the earliest. See id. ¶¶ 17–19. When the buildings are demolished during Phase\n\nOne, Michael Meers asserts that all residents in those buildings will be “relocated at owner\n\nexpense to an appropriate apartment home on the property.” See id. ¶ 17 (emphasis added). Mr.\n\nMeers further declares that, although some tenants have been moved, none have been unable to\n\nrelocate at Brookland Manor. See id. Citing to HUD guidelines and the D.C. Office of\n\nPlanning’s finding that the D.C. Zoning Commission cited favorably, Defendants’ own numbers\n\n\nthey argue, Defendants have already relocated “the overwhelming majority of [that block’s]\nresidents,” id. at 12 they should be even more capable of providing the Court with something in\nthe record to show that a family has been relocated and unable to move into another apartment\non the property. If anything, this supports Defendants’ argument that all families who will be\nrelocated from Block 7 will be able to relocate on the property. But even more to the point, the\nsubmission that Plaintiffs reference refers specifically to Block 7. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp.\nof Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 3, at 1, ECF No. 20-3. The D.C. Zoning Commission knew that\nBlock 7 was going to be demolished during Phase One, yet still credited a report that the larger\nunits would not be phased out until the later stages of redevelopment. See Mid-City Fin. Corp.,\nZ.C. Case 14-18, at 38, 50.\n       11\n            For the same reasons noted in note 10, Plaintiffs’ arguments about relocation occurring\nwell in advance of demolition are unavailing. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for a\nPrelim. Inj., at 13. Although it is obviously true that relocation must occur before demolition,\nthis fact, if anything, shows that Defendants are capable of relocating tenants to other locations\non the property.\n\n\n                                                37\n\fshow that only 13 Brookland Manor households would currently require a four-bedroom\n\napartment, and none would require a five-bedroom apartment.12 See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C.\n\nCase 14-18, at 38. The same finding from the D.C. Office of Planning noted that “[t]he building\n\nwith the larger units would remain on the site until the later phases at which time they can be\n\n‘right sized’ to accommodate the larger families.” Id.\n\n       Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any families—let alone a disproportionate\n\nnumber of them—are facing the imminent threat of being forced to relocate until well after the\n\ncase can be fully adjudicated. Plaintiffs do not, for example, point to a particular family that\n\nlives in the block of houses scheduled to be demolished during Phase One that would be unable\n\nto move into an apartment elsewhere at Brookland Manor. Although Plaintiffs cite to certain\n\nsecond-hand sources alluding to the idea of relocation, see, e.g., Jenkins Decl., Defendants cite to\n\nspecific attributes of the redevelopment project showing otherwise. The Vice President of Mid-\n\nCity has stated that it is “highly unlikely” that Phase One could begin until August, 2017, and\n\nthat it would be much more likely to begin later in 2017. And, assuring the Court that the harm\n\nis not imminent even further into the future, he states that no resident will be forced to move\n\naway from Brookland Manor during Stage One, leaving the Plaintiffs with no ground to stand on\n\nuntil Stage Two, which is at least three years away. This makes sense in the context of\n\nDefendants’ contention that many families are in apartments that are too large, that the building\n\nwith larger units will remain until later phases of redevelopment, and that vacancies currently\n\nexist that can be used to house displaced households from Block 7.13 The situations of individual\n\n\n       12\n          Plaintiffs are correct that D.C. occupancy law may make this number higher in certain\ncases. However, they do not tell the Court how frequently this is the case, or otherwise carry\ntheir burden of showing the extent of the issues in light of Defendants’ evidence.\n       13\n         It is worth noting that although Plaintiffs’ methodology is plausible for HUD’s “step\none” showing of disparate impact at the motion-to-dismiss stage, it comes up short in showing\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fPlaintiffs give the Court further assurance: there are no plans that would require Ms. Borum to\n\nrelocate until 2020 at the earliest or Ms. Holloman until 2023. Even if the proposed class were\n\ncertified here, vague stories and misgivings from tenants are insufficient for Plaintiffs to shoulder\n\ntheir burden of showing that an irreparable injury will likely occur if the Court waits to\n\nadjudicate the dispute on the merits. Although it is certainly possible that Defendants’ plans\n\ncould change by moving the process up considerably, Plaintiffs have not met the “high standard”\n\nof showing that they imminently face their alleged injuries. The chance that the timeline moves\n\nup, disparate impact will occur at Phase One, or Plaintiffs will otherwise suffer injury does not\n\nrise to the level of a “clear and present threat” necessary for a showing of irreparable injury.\n\nBecause some showing of imminent irreparable injury is required for the issuance of a\n\npreliminary injunction, the Court must deny Plaintiffs’ motion.\n\n        If Plaintiffs do obtain evidence showing that imminent injury is likely to occur, the\n\nMotion can be renewed and will be reconsidered in light of such new evidence. And, because\n\nDefendants applied for Stage Two PUD approval ahead of schedule and stop short of\n\nguaranteeing that they will follow the timeline set forth in their declarations, the Court will\n\nimpose on Defendants a requirement to report to the Court and Plaintiffs any changes in schedule\n\n\n\n\nthat “families”—as defined by the FHA—will necessarily be forced to relocate away from the\nproperty at a disproportionate rate during the later stages of redevelopment. As noted above and\nshown by a plain reading of the statutory text, the FHA protects only minor children living with\nparents (or similar guardians). See 42 U.S.C. § 3602(k). The definition of “family” does not, for\nexample, “encompass groups of more than one family.” Doe v. City of Butler, 892 F.2d 315, 326\n(3d Cir. 1989) (Roth, J., dissenting). Thus, a group of people cannot talismanically receive\nprotection under the FHA just because one of them happens to be a parent domiciled with a\nminor child. Although the Court need not reach the issue given the lack of imminent irreparable\ninjury, in light of the fact that all tenants will eventually have to relocate to different units on the\nproperty, see Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at 2 (noting that all the existing buildings\nwill be replaced), the Court queries whether breaking up groups of people—including extended\nfamilies—into separate apartments will necessarily disparately impact “families.”\n\n\n                                                  39\n\fthat might make displacement of tenants at Brookland Manor more imminent than it was when\n\nthey made their declarations in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED and Plaintiffs’\n\nMotion for a Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.

INTRODUCTION\n\n       At first glance, this case places the Court in the unenviable position of either standing in\n\nthe way of residential redevelopment or jeopardizing the homes of families who depend on the\n\nstatus quo. Defendants are several companies planning to redevelop their existing apartment\n\ncomplex into a more modern development with many more one- and two-bedroom units.\n\nPlaintiffs are a nonprofit organization and two tenants, purporting to represent a class, who\n\ncontend that Defendants’ elimination of many three-, four-, and five-bedroom apartments in the\n\nprocess will disproportionately impact families in violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act and\n\na comparable District of Columbia statute. Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief on the\n\ngrounds that they face imminent irreparable harm if Defendants proceed with their\n\nredevelopment plan. Defendants counter that any of the alleged injuries would not occur until\n\nyears down the road. They also move to dismiss on several procedural grounds, and because\n\nPlaintiffs “cherry-pick” a narrow demographic—“large families”—from the entirety of the class\n\nprotected under the FHA—families—and focus only on the destruction of certain apartments and\n\fnot the construction of many more. Because Defendants’ procedural arguments are flawed and\n\nPlaintiffs do not cherry-pick data, the Court will deny the Motion to Dismiss. Because Plaintiffs\n\ndo not adequately show that the threatened injuries are imminent, the Court will deny the Motion\n\nfor a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n\n                                II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n                                         A. Complaint1\n\n       Defendants Brentwood Associates, L.P.,2 Mid-City Financial Corporation, and\n\nEdgewood Management Corporation are owners of an affordable housing development located\n\nin Northeast D.C. See Compl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 2. They are in the process of redeveloping their\n\ndeteriorating 75-year-old buildings, in part by increasing the total number of units but decreasing\n\nthe number of larger-sized apartments. See District of Columbia Zoning Commission, Order No.\n\n14-18, Case No. 14-18 at 33 (Mid-City Fin. Corp.) (Sept. 10, 2015), available at ECF No. 4-18\n\n[hereinafter Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18];3 Compl. ¶¶ 4–5. Their redevelopment plan\n\n\n       1\n          Because the Court considers different information when analyzing a motion to dismiss\nthan it does with a motion for a preliminary injunction, the relevant facts are divided into two\nsections.\n       2\n         Per stipulation, Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed the case against Defendant\nBrentwood Village, LLC, because Brentwood Village does not have an ownership interest in the\nproperty subject to the suit. See Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, ECF No. 12.\n       3\n          With respect to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, the Court takes judicial notice of the\nfacts in the District of Columbia Zoning Commission proceeding involving Defendants and their\nproposed redevelopment only to “avoid unnecessary proceedings when an undisputed fact on the\npublic record makes it clear that the plaintiff does not state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted.” Covad Commc’ns Co. v.

See Compl.\n\n¶¶ 32, 46. In light of social, economic, and practical considerations, the D.C. Zoning\n\nCommission agreed with Defendants that, like in other developments nationwide, it would not be\n\neconomical to build four- and five-bedroom units. See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at\n\n52, 56. The plan also calls for the decrease of three-bedroom apartments from 75 to 64 units.\n\nCompl. ¶ 47. In all, the redevelopment would decrease the number of three-, four-, and five-\n\nbedroom apartments from 209 to 64. Id. ¶ 5. It would also displace at least 119 households—the\n\nmajority of which are families—currently residing at Brookland Manor. Id. ¶¶ 50–53, 75. Even\n\nthe remaining three-bedroom apartments might not be affordable, “further reducing the available\n\nhousing for larger families.” Id. ¶ 52. Defendant Mid-City’s Vice President Michael Meers\n\ntestified before the D.C. Zoning Commission that “all residents in good standing shall have the\n\nopportunity to return to the redeveloped property . . . [a]nd when relocations do occur[,]\n\nownership will pay for all packing and moving expenses.” Id. ¶ 54.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that the redevelopment plan would have a disparate impact on families.\n\nSee id. ¶¶ 69–79. Among the 486 occupied units at Brookland Manor, 253 (52%) are occupied\n\nby “families” that Plaintiffs claim are within the relevant statutory definitions, which the\n\nComplaint defines as “those who have one or more minor children living in the household.” See\n\nid. ¶ 72. Of the 303 one- and two- bedroom apartments, only 104 (34%) are occupied by\n\nfamilies, as defined by Plaintiffs. Id. ¶ 74. Of the 183 three-, four-, and five-bedroom units, 149\n\n(81%) are occupied by families. Id. Taken together, 149 families—comprising 59% of families\n\noverall—are at risk of displacement because of the development, compared to only 34 non-\n\n\n\n\nstate that they “are not challenging the Zoning Comission’s approval of Mid-City’s stage-one\nPUD application”).\n\n\n                                                  3\n\ffamilies—15% overall. Id. ¶ 77. The new development would contain about 1,760 units,\n\nincluding 1,646 apartments. Id. ¶¶ 48. There are currently around 535 apartment units at\n\nBrookland. See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at 7.\n\n       Individual Plaintiffs—Ms. Adriann Borum and Ms. Loretta Holloman—allege that\n\nredevelopment would force them out of their homes and subject them to multiple forms of injury.\n\nSee Compl. ¶¶ 80–107. Ms. Borum lives in a four-bedroom apartment unit with her five\n\nchildren, who range in age from 7 to 21. Id. ¶¶ 94–95. She and her children depend on the local\n\ncommunity for academic, religious, and recreational support. Id. ¶¶ 97–101. If the family is\n\ninvoluntarily displaced, “Ms. Borum will have an extremely difficult time finding an\n\nadequately[-]sized apartment in D.C. for her family because of the scarcity of affordable housing\n\nof her unit type.” Id. ¶ 105. Ms. Holloman lives with her mother, brother, and three school-aged\n\nchildren in a four-bedroom Brookland Manor apartment. Id. ¶¶ 80–81. Her brother and one of\n\nher children are both autistic and attend a special-needs programs—one for children and one for\n\nadults—in the community. Id. ¶ 82–83. She too will have a difficult time finding a replacement\n\napartment for her family, may have to move outside of D.C., and will lose the irreplaceable\n\ncommunity on which she and her family depend. See id. ¶¶ 82–91.\n\n       Individual Plaintiffs bring this case on behalf of themselves and “all others similarly\n\nsituated” including “[a]ll households who reside or have resided at Brookland Manor in a three-,\n\nfour-, or five-bedroom unit with one or more minor child,” and who have either been displaced\n\nor are at risk of being displaced by Defendants’ proposed redevelopment project. See id. ¶ 122.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that at least 149 families are in the Proposed Class, and that the redevelopment\n\nwill have “the same impact on all class members.” Id. ¶¶ 125–27. According to Plaintiffs, all\n\nmembers of the Proposed Class are interested in the case because the redevelopment project\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fsignificantly decreases the amount of available housing suitable for families, would have a\n\ndisparate impact on families, and may have been motivated by a discriminatory purpose. See id.\n\n¶ 127. Moreover, Plaintiffs argue, a single injunction would afford the primary relief that\n\nmembers of the Proposed Class seek. Id. ¶ 137.\n\n       The final Plaintiff, community organization ONE DC, is “comprised of members who\n\ninclude tenants of affordable housing properties that are seeking to avoid displacement, preserve\n\naffordable housing, ensure fair housing, and further equitable development in D.C.” Id. ¶ 108.\n\nONE DC seeks this injunction “on its own behalf and as a representatives of its members,\n\nincluding members who are residents of Brookland Manor and have minor children.” Id. ¶ 109.\n\nIt further asserts that Defendants’ conduct has directly “damaged ONE DC by frustrating its\n\nmission of creating and preserving racial and economic equity in D.C. for all and by causing\n\nONE DC to divert scarce organizational resources,” particularly given that the organization has\n\nonly two fulltime staff members. See id. ¶¶ 111–12. As a result of Defendants’ actions, ONE\n\nDC diverted its resources from its mission to “crisis organizing” through “identifying,\n\ninvestigating, and combating Defendants’ discriminatory policies and practices, and to\n\ncounseling, organizing, and reassuring tenants who have been forcibly moved or have feared\n\nimminent displacement under Defendants’ proposed redevelopment plan.” Id. ¶ 113, 118. For\n\nexample, after hearing about the proposed redevelopment, ONE DC organized a series of\n\n“Outreach Days.” Id. ¶¶ 114–16. In all, ONE DC alleges that, as of July 28, 2016, it had spent\n\n640 staff-hours on “combat[ing] Defendants’ discriminatory conduct.” Id. ¶ 121.\n\n       To implement their redevelopment, Defendants have petitioned the D.C. Zoning\n\nCommission through the “planned unit development (PUD) process.” See id. ¶ 43; D.C. Mun.\n\nRegs. tit. 11-X, § 300. In October, 2014, Defendants submitted an application for a First-Stage\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fPUD and Related Zoning Map Amendment (“First-Stage PUD”) with the D.C. Zoning\n\nCommission. Compl. ¶ 44; see generally D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11-X, § 302. The Zoning\n\nCommission approved the First-Stage PUD application in June, 2015, and its order became final\n\non November 6, 2015. Compl. ¶ 56. Now, Defendants have filed a Second-Stage PUD\n\napplication, the approval of which would allow Defendants to begin redevelopment and\n\ndestruction of Plaintiffs’ apartments. See Pl. Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at\n\n17–18, ECF No. 20; Compl. ¶ 57.\n\n       During the course of the redevelopment process, Defendants made comments that\n\nPlaintiffs allege are discriminatory. See Compl. ¶ 59. In a December 2014 letter to the\n\nBrookland Manor Residents Association, Defendant Mid-City stated that four- and five-bedroom\n\napartments are “not an ideal housing type for larger families and there are adverse impacts on the\n\nremainder of the community.” Id. ¶ 61. The following month, Mid-City said that there would\n\nnot be four- or five-bedroom units because they are “not consistent with the creation of a vibrant\n\nnew community.” Id. ¶ 62. Then, in an April 2015 hearing in front of the Zoning Commission,\n\nDefendant Mid-City, representing Brentwood Village, said that “[c]ommunities and\n\norganizations throughout the country are in agreement that housing very large families in\n\napartment complexes is significantly impactful upon the quality of life of households as well as\n\ntheir surrounding neighbors. Therefore, [Defendants do] not propose to construct four or five\n\nbedroom units in the project.” Id. ¶ 60.\n\n       Plaintiffs now allege that Defendants violated the Federal Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) by\n\nundertaking the redevelopment project that will disproportionately reduce the amount of\n\napartments available for families, which they allege constitutes discrimination on the basis of\n\nfamilial status. See id. ¶¶ 140–50. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants violated the District\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fof Columbia Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”) on similar grounds. See id. ¶¶ 151–62. Plaintiffs\n\nmake separate claims under both statutes alleging discriminatory statements, because of\n\nDefendants’ statements suggesting that housing for large families is incompatible with the\n\ncommunity they seek to create. See id. ¶¶ 163–78. Defendants do not aim the Motion to\n\nDismiss at Plaintiffs’ claims about these alleged statements.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ Complaint seeks certification of a class, a judgment declaring that the\n\nproposed plan’s decrease of the number of units available for certain families violates the FHA\n\nand DCHRA, “any and all injunctive relief that the Court may deem appropriate,” compensatory\n\nand punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. See Prayer for Relief, Compl. at 35–36.\n\n                            B. Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n\n        In addition to the above allegations, Plaintiffs and Defendants each put forward evidence\n\nfor consideration of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n                                      1. Plaintiffs’ Evidence\n\n       Plaintiffs put forth evidence that they argue shows that Plaintiffs face threats of injury if\n\nthe redevelopment project proceeds. They submit a statement from Defendants to the Zoning\n\nCommission confirming the numerical allegations in the Complaint. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of\n\nMot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 12, ECF No. 4-13. To digest the redevelopment plan in numerical\n\nterms, they also submit the declaration of a social-statistician, Dr. Andrew Beveridge. See Pls.’\n\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 1 (“Beveridge Decl.”), ¶ 9, ECF No. 4-2. Based on\n\nhis analysis of the redevelopment plans, he states that “families would be more than four times as\n\nlikely as non-families to be adversely affected by the planned redevelopment because 58.9[%] of\n\nthe families at Brookland Manor live in three-, four-, or five-bedroom units . . . [and] [i]n\n\ncontrast, only 14.6[%] of non-families live in such . . . units.” See id. ¶ 9. Dr. Beveridge further\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fasserts that families will face difficulty finding new housing, or, for the few families that might\n\nbe able to remain at Brookland, overcrowding. See id. ¶¶ 10–11.\n\n        Individual Plaintiffs assert specific injuries that they will suffer if Defendants carry out\n\nthe redevelopment. Ms. Holloman claims in a declaration that she and her family will “suffer\n\ndisplacement,” and leave her along with her “aging mother, brother with special needs, and three\n\nminor children with nowhere to go.” See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 5\n\n(“Holloman Decl.”), ¶ 9(a), ECF No. 4-6. She predicates this assertion on her “strong[] belie[f]\n\nthat [she] will be unable to find housing that will accommodate [her] family’s size and special\n\nneeds” within the community and at an affordable price. See id. ¶ 9(a)(i). She specifically\n\nworries that her mother will be unable to continue her “essential” career training classes, her\n\nbrother will lose his “essential” special-needs program, her autistic son will lose his “crucial”\n\nspecial needs classes, her other children will lose their local schooling, and the whole family will\n\nlose its community connections. See id. ¶¶ 9(a)(i)–(vi). Ultimately, she is “concerned that [her]\n\nfamily could be forcibly broken up,” leaving her separated from her children. See id. ¶ 9(b). In\n\naddition to the toll moving would take on her family, she claims she will suffer her own\n\nemotional distress. See id. ¶ 9(e). Ms. Borum similarly asserts that without a four-bedroom unit\n\nshe and her family cannot reside at Brookland, putting her family at risk of displacement or\n\nfragmentation. See Pl.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 4, ¶ 9(a), ECF No. 4-5. She\n\nclaims that she personally is “aware of” other families who have “been asked to leave the\n\nproperty” or been “broken up.” See id. ¶ 8. Like Ms. Holloman, Ms. Borum believes the\n\nredevelopment would make it impossible for her and her family to remain in the community.\n\nSee id. ¶ 9(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       To bolster their claims that Defendants’ redevelopment will displace or break apart\n\nfamilies, Plaintiffs submit second-hand declarations of people who claim they know of other\n\nfamilies who have been forced to relocate. See id. ¶ 8; Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim.\n\nInj. Ex. 9 (“McFadden Decl.”), ¶ 6, ECF No. 4-10 (declaration of tenant Reginald McFadden,\n\nwherein he asserts that he is “aware of other families who have already had to transfer to another\n\nunit . . . , had their families broken up into smaller units, or been asked to leave”); Pls.’ Mem. in\n\nSupp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 10 (“Scott Decl.”), ¶ 6, ECF No. 4-11 (declaration of tenant\n\nValarie Scott asserting the same); Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 8 (“Jenkins\n\nDecl.”), ¶ 6, ECF No. 4-9 (declaration of tenant Javon Jenkins asserting the same). Although\n\nPlaintiffs acknowledge that Defendants will allow families the right to return to Brookland, see\n\nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 15, at 3, ECF No. 4-16, they argue that families\n\ncannot do so without larger apartments, which are scarce in the District of Columbia, see Pls.’\n\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 2 (“Merrifield Decl.”), ¶ 27, ECF No. 4-3. Plaintiffs\n\nassert that families who rely on Section 8 vouchers to subsidize their rent payments will be\n\nparticularly affected by redevelopment, because units available to lower-earning households are\n\neven scarcer than they are for the general population. See Merrifield Decl., ¶¶ 18, 32–34.\n\n       Plaintiffs also produce evidence that they argue shows that the threatened injuries against\n\nPlaintiffs are imminent, if not occurring already. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim.\n\nInj., at 26, ECF No. 4. As noted above, several tenants argue that they know of families who\n\nhave been forcibly moved or separated by Defendants. More broadly, Plaintiffs argue that\n\n“Defendants will soon receive final approval of their proposed redevelopment.” See id. at 13.\n\nThe D.C. Zoning Commission gave first-stage PUD approval to Defendants’ redevelopment\n\nplan, and Defendants submitted an application for second-stage PUD approval weeks before it\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fwas due. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 17, ECF No. 4-18 (D.C. Zoning\n\nCommission approval); Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 2, ECF No. 20-2\n\n(Defendants’ stage-two application, dated September 20, 2016); Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to\n\nDismiss, at 9, ECF No. 16-1 (noting that Defendants were required to submit a stage-two\n\napplication by November 6, 2016). Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ early submission of the\n\nstage-two application shows just how quickly they intend to implement the redevelopment. See\n\nPls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 12. With Defendants’ submission of\n\nanother application for stage-two approval, the Zoning Commission can immediately consider\n\nthe proposal, and if the Commission gives approval, Defendants may begin redeveloping\n\nimmediately thereafter. See D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11-Z, § 702. At that point, Plaintiffs argue,\n\nthere will be no way to stop Defendants from inflicting irreparable injuries upon Plaintiffs. See\n\nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 14. Plaintiffs further argue that a recent filing\n\nwith the Zoning Commission shows that the first phase of redevelopment will affect a building\n\nthat is made up almost entirely of three- and four-bedroom units. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp.\n\nof Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 3, at 1, ECF No. 20-3.\n\n       To show that Defendants do not want “large families to reside on their property,” see\n\nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 15, Plaintiffs put forth statements made by\n\nDefendants in connection with the redevelopment project. See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for\n\nPrelim. Inj. Ex. 12, at 6; Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 18, at 8, ECF No. 4-19.\n\nIn a submission to the Zoning Commission, Defendants stated that “housing very large families\n\nin apartment communities is significantly impactful upon the quality of life of households as well\n\nas their surrounding neighbors.” See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 12, at 6.\n\nThen, in response to a question from tenants, Defendants stated that they would “not build any\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fnew [four-bedroom] or [five-bedroom] apartment flats as our practical experience has\n\ndemonstrated that it is not an ideal housing type for larger families and there are adverse impacts\n\non the remainder of the community.” See Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 18, at\n\n8.\n\n                                     2. Defendants’ Evidence\n\n       Defendants produce evidence telling a different story. According to Michael S. Meers,\n\nExecutive Vice President of Defendant Mid-City Financial Corporation, the redevelopment is an\n\ninnocuous response to two principal concerns. See Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex.\n\n1 (“Meers Aff.”), ¶ 1, ECF No. 18-1. First, “[t]he existing buildings are now 75 years old and\n\nare functionally obsolete with all of the major systems requiring replacement,” with the property\n\nlast having been renovated over 40 years ago. Id. ¶ 6. The District of Columbia Office of\n\nPlanning concurred with Defendants that “the buildings and the infrastructure [of Brookland] are\n\nnot optimally functional.” See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at 64. Second, “the urban\n\ndesign of the original community and buildings . . . has resulted in the property not being as\n\nsafe” as it could be because of crime. Meers Aff. ¶ 7. Mr. Meers attributes the “ongoing crime\n\nproblems” to the street configuration’s lack of conduciveness to “efficient pedestrian and\n\nvehicular access through the subject property,” resulting in a kind of isolation from the\n\nsurrounding community. See id. In addition, Defendants plan to provide many more homes for\n\nall—regardless of familial status—by expanding the existing 535 apartment units to 1,760 total\n\nunits, including 1,646 apartments. See id. ¶ 8, 10. The Zoning Commission agreed with\n\nDefendants that including larger units would be impractical. See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case\n\n14-18, at 52, 56. As for the families who claim to require larger units, Defendants indirectly\n\ninvoke a study purportedly showing that several Brookland tenants currently reside in apartments\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fthat are too big for their respective occupants, based on “the HUD guidelines of two persons per\n\nbedroom,” so that only “13 exiting households would require four bedrooms and no household\n\nwould require five bedrooms.” See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at 38. The Zoning\n\nCommission favorably cited the D.C. Office of Planning as having considered this information\n\nprior to stage-one PUD approval, see id. at 35–38, but neither the HUD guidelines nor the study\n\nare themselves in the record. The Office of Planning also found that Defendant planned to\n\nmaintain “[t]he building with the larger units . . . until the later phases at which time they can be\n\n‘right sized’ to accommodate larger families.” See id. at 38.\n\n       Defendants emphasize that any displacement of tenants would not occur until years down\n\nthe road, during later phases of the redevelopment project. See Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for\n\nPrelim. Inj., at 6, ECF No. 18. Defendants plan to implement the redevelopment project in three\n\nphases. See id. During “Phase One” in late 2017, three of the current 19 buildings that\n\nconstitute Brookland Manor will be replaced by 28 for-sale units and 200 senior-citizen units.\n\nSee Meers Aff. ¶ 17. These buildings are called “Block 7.” See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case\n\n14-18, at 50. All residents in those three buildings will be “relocated at ownership expense to an\n\nappropriate apartment home on the property.” Id. Some tenants have been moved, but “[n]o\n\ntenant in [the three affected buildings] has been forced to move outside the development as a\n\nresult of any failure to accommodate that tenant elsewhere in the development.” See Meers Aff.\n\n¶ 17. Because Defendants would need the units created by Phase One to relocate tenants, Phase\n\nTwo and Phase Three will not begin until 2019. See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at\n\n50. Individual Plaintiffs would not need to vacate during Phase One. Defendants do not\n\nanticipate forcing Ms. Borum to relocate until “at least 2020” or forcing Ms. Holloman to\n\nrelocate “until 2023.” Meers Aff. ¶¶ 18–19 (also declaring that any communication concerning\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\frelocation “will not happen until the year 2020 at the earliest for Plaintiff Borum, and the year\n\n2023 at the earliest for Plaintiff Holloman”). The record does not show that any of the affiants\n\nthat Plaintiffs cite in their motion, see Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 10, will be\n\nrequired to move away from Brookland as a result of the redevelopment until after Phase One.\n\nSee generally Meers Aff.; Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 2 (“Sanquist Aff.”), ¶ 6,\n\nECF No. 18-2.\n\n       If a preliminary injunction were to be granted, Defendants argue, they would be severely\n\nharmed. “Based on the Zoning Commission’s approval, Mid-City has subsequently expended\n\nsignificant capital on architecture, landscaping, engineering, legal services[,] and financing\n\nopportunities in anticipation of . . . construction phasing outlined in the approved PUD.” Meers\n\nAff. ¶ 23. Not only will this mean that Defendants “would suffer enormous financial harm,” but\n\nit might mean that they would be unable to build the additional units and “be forced to re-\n\nevaluate the commitment to voluntarily retain the Section 8 contract that assists 373 very-low\n\nincome families in the District of Columbia.” Id. ¶ 24. In fact, “[i]n the case of delay, Mid-City\n\ncould be forced to leave the aging property ‘as is’ and convert the existing units to true\n\nunrestricted market rate units.” Id.\n\n\n                                          III. ANALYSIS\n\n       Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction. In the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction,\n\nPlaintiffs move for the Court to enjoin Defendants from submitting a second-stage PUD\n\napplication. See Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 3. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs request “any\n\nand all injunctive relief that the Court may deem appropriate, including entering a preliminary . .\n\n. injunction ordering Defendants to . . . cease violating” Plaintiffs’ rights under the Federal Fair\n\nHousing Act and District of Columbia Human Rights Act. See Prayer for Relief, Compl. at 35–\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f36. After Plaintiffs filed their Complaint and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Defendants\n\nsubmitted a second-stage PUD application, see Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim.\n\nInj. Ex. 2, making the specific request in Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction moot.\n\nNonetheless, the Court considers Plaintiffs’ request for an appropriate preliminary injunction to\n\nremedy their injuries.4\n\n       Using a theory of disparate impact, Plaintiffs argue that the redevelopment plan “will\n\neffectively eliminate housing for the majority of large families at the Brookland Manor\n\nproperty,” and that without a preliminary injunction, “it is almost certain that the nearly 150\n\nfamilies now resident at Brookland Manor will lose their housing during the pendency of this\n\nlitigation.” See Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 1. Defendants oppose a preliminary injunction,\n\narguing that the alleged injuries are not imminent, Plaintiffs are unlikely to be successful on the\n\nmerits, and that preliminarily enjoining the redevelopment would significantly harm Defendants\n\nand the public.5 See generally Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj.\n\n       Defendants move to dismiss on a number of grounds. They advance four procedural\n\narguments: first, that Plaintiffs did not exhaust their administrative remedies through the zoning\n\n\n\n       4\n            In their Reply Memorandum, Plaintiffs assert that they “now modify the requested form\nof relief and seek to enjoin Defendants from taking any action towards residents meant to\neffectuate their challenged redevelopment plan, including relocating tenants on or off the\nproperty, evicting, moving, or otherwise bringing about the cessation of tenancy in preparation\nfor . . . redevelopment.” Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 18, ECF No. 20.\nPlaintiffs did not move to amend their request for a preliminary injunction. However, because\nthese are possible “appropriate” forms of a preliminary injunction meant to preserve Plaintiffs’\nrights, the Court will consider them with respect to any preliminary injunction it might issue.\n       5\n          Defendants previously argued that Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction preventing the filing\nof a second-stage PUD application would have violated the United States Constitution because it\nwould block access to the Zoning Commission and constitute a prior restraint. See Defs.’ Opp’n\nto Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 11–13. As Plaintiffs acknowledge, because Defendants already\nsubmitted their application, the Court is unable to impose such an injunction, making the\nargument moot. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim.

Defendants cite to Univ. of Tennessee v. Elliott, a case in which the Supreme\n\nCourt reasoned that it saw “no reason to suppose that Congress, in enacting the Reconstruction\n\ncivil rights statutes, wished to foreclose the adaptation of traditional principles of preclusion to\n\nsuch subsequent developments as the burgeoning use of administrative adjudication in the 20th\n\ncentury.” See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111757\"><a href=\"/opinion/111757/universityof-tennessee-v-elliott/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 797 (1986). Even putting aside the technical requirements of claim\n\nand issue preclusion, Elliott is not controlling here. Unlike in that case, where there was “no\n\nreason to suppose that Congress” intended to foreclose preclusion, as noted above, Congress\n\n“carefully chose[]” to allow plaintiffs to “proceed directly into federal court” to vindicate their\n\nfederal rights. Gladstone Realtors, 441 U.S. at 125–26.

Tenley & Cleveland Park\n\nEmergency Comm., 550 A.2d at 341 n.22. Because DC’s “broad framework” is not comparable\n\nto the Federal FHA and Defendants do not identify any power to independently review private\n\nFHA violations,7 there is no indication that the District of Columbia Zoning Commission could\n\nbe considered a “competent” “court” for purposes of reviewing FHA claims.\n\n\n       6\n          Defendants contend that this is not the proper provision providing the Zoning\nCommission with its powers. See Defs.’ Reply to Pls.’ Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss, at 15, ECF\nNo. 24. They cite part (a) of D.C. Code § 6-621.01 for the proposition that the Zoning\nCommission has general power “[t]o protect the public health, secure the public safety, and to\nprotect property.” See id. However, after this clause follows: “there is created a Zoning\nCommission.” See D.C. Code § 6-621.01(a). Then, part (e), which grants the Commission its\npower, provides that “[t]he Zoning Commission shall exercise all the powers . . . with respect to\nzoning . . . as provided by law.” See D.C. Code § 6-621.01(e) (emphasis added). So, although\npart (a) outlines broad purposes for creating a Zoning Commission, it does not by itself grant\npower.\n       7\n         In their reply memorandum, Defendants assert that a footnote of a D.C. District Court\n“not[ed] that the Zoning Commission may find that regulations governing community-based\nresidential facilities are violative of the FHA.” See Defs.’ Reply to Pls.’ Opp’n to Mot. to\nDismiss, at 15. In fact, this is not the case, at least using any meaningful definition of the word\n“find.” That footnote quoted the Zoning Commission as simply stating that a regulation “could\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f                                        D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n       Defendants also seek dismissal of the DCHRA count on exhaustion grounds. Similar to\n\nthe FHA, the DCHRA provides that “[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory practice shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for\n\ndamages and such other remedies as may be appropriate, unless such person has filed a[n\n\nadministrative] complaint.” D.C. Code § 2-1403.16(a); see also Williams v. District of\n\nColumbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (D.C. 1983) (noting that the DCHRA provides “direct resort to the\n\ncourts,” but holding that government employees must exhaust administrative remedies in some\n\ncases). The plain language of the DCHRA commands the same finding as the language of the\n\nFHA. Because the Court is one of “competent jurisdiction” and Plaintiffs claim to be “aggrieved\n\nby an unlawful discriminatory practice” under the DCHRA, Plaintiffs did not need to exhaust\n\nany District of Columbia administrative remedies. Given the arguably stronger language in the\n\nD.C. statute (“[a]ny person . . . shall have a cause of action”), this reasoning applies equally to\n\nissues of preclusion here. Moreover, there is no indication that the District of Columbia Zoning\n\nCommission is a competent “court” to review such a claim. The Court will not give preclusive\n\neffects to any findings by the Zoning Commission.\n\n                                 2. The Rooker–Feldman Doctrine\n\n       The Court next considers Defendants’ argument that the Court lacks subject-matter\n\njurisdiction to consider this matter under the Rooker–Feldman doctrine. Defendants argue that\n\nreview of this case would functionally constitute an appeal of a state-level judgment. “The\n\nRooker–Feldman doctrine . . . is confined to . . . cases brought by state-court losers complaining\n\n\n\nbe subject to challenge under the provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act,” not ruling on\nit substantively.

When the Supreme Court declined review, the plaintiff filed an action in a federal\n\ndistrict court. Id. The Supreme Court “viewed the action as tantamount to an appeal of the\n\nIndiana Supreme Court decision, over which only [the Supreme] Court had jurisdiction, and said\n\nthat the ‘aggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no longer can do\n\ndirectly.’” Id. (quoting Rooker, 263 U.S. at 416). Sixty years later in Feldman, the Court\n\napplied the same reasoning to a District of Columbia Court of Appeals decision refusing\n\nadmission to a bar applicant.

Accordingly, Rooker–Feldman is inapplicable.\n\n                                      3. Younger Abstention\n\n       Defendants invoke the related doctrine of Younger abstention in support of their Motion\n\nto Dismiss. “In Younger v. Harris and its progeny, the Supreme Court held that, except in\n\nextraordinary circumstances, a federal court should not enjoin a pending state proceeding\n\n(including an administrative proceeding) that is judicial in nature and involves important state\n\ninterests.” JMM Corp. v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186293\"><a href=\"/opinion/186293/jmm-corp-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1120 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The\n\ndoctrine stems from the equitable principle that “courts . . . should not act, and particularly\n\nshould not act to restrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party has an adequate remedy\n\nat law and will not suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable relief.” Younger v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43–44 (1971). At its core, Younger abstention stems from concerns of comity and\n\nfederalism and prevents federal courts from enjoining ongoing criminal prosecutions. See id.;\n\nsee also Samuels v. Mackell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108264\"><a href=\"/opinion/108264/george-samuels-v-thomas-j-mackell-district-attorney-fred-fernandez-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (1971). Moving beyond the core of the doctrine,\n\nfederal courts also abstain in quasi-criminal contexts. Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109216\"><a href=\"/opinion/109216/huffman-v-pursue-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n604 (1975) (abstaining in a civil context because “the proceeding is both in aid of and closely\n\nrelated to criminal statutes which prohibit the dissemination of obscene materials”). The\n\nperiphery of the doctrine may encompass proceedings not in courts, but that are judicial in nature\n\nand concern important state interests. See New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fNew Orleans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112302\"><a href=\"/opinion/112302/new-orleans-public-service-inc-v-council-of-city-of-new-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364–73 (1989). The doctrine has even been applied to suits\n\nbetween two non-state parties where the underlying dispute concerned important state interests.\n\nSee, e.g., Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111856\"><a href=\"/opinion/111856/pennzoil-co-v-texaco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1987). In a case between private parties,\n\nfederal courts must abstain when (1) the relief sought would enjoin an ongoing state proceeding,\n\n(2) the state proceeding is judicial in nature, (3) “the state proceedings implicate important state\n\ninterests,” and (4) “the proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to raise the federal claims.”\n\nSee William Penn Apartments, 39 F. Supp. at 19 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n       The Court need not address all four requirements, because Defendants’ argument fails to\n\nestablish that the Zoning Commission proceedings “afford an adequate opportunity to raise the\n\nfederal claims.” Defendants argue that a D.C. Federal District Court has said that “[t]he Board\n\nof Zoning Adjustment ha[s] authority to consider reasonable accommodation request[s],”\n\nimplying that the board could consider such requests under the FHA. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp.\n\nof Mot. to Dismiss, at 29. In fact, that court suggested the opposite—although acknowledging\n\nthat the Board of Zoning Adjustment has the power to make a reasonable accommodation sua\n\nsponte under the “functional equivalent” of the FHA under D.C. regulations, the court explicitly\n\nstated that “the [DC Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs] is the body to whom a\n\nrequest for reasonable accommodation is properly lodged in the first instance.” See United\n\nStates v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296397\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296397/united-states-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (D.D.C. 2008). The court cited 14\n\nD.C.M.R. § 111, which is entitled “Procedures Regarding Requests for Reasonable\n\nAccommodation Under the Fair Housing Act.” That regulation provides that “[a]ll requests for\n\nreasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act shall be submitted to the Director,\n\nDepartment of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs . . . or such office as the District may assign or\n\ndelegate.” 14 D.C.M.R. § 111.3. Similarly, here, as noted above in the Court’s discussion of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fissue and claim preclusion, the Zoning Commission is not a body empowered to hear FHA\n\nclaims. Thus, the Court will not abstain from addressing the merits of Plaintiffs’ federal claims.\n\n                                        4. ONE DC Standing\n\n        The Court next addresses Defendants’ argument that ONE DC—the community\n\norganization with some members who are residents of Brookland Manor with minor children, see\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 108–09—lacks standing to bring this matter. Defendants specifically argue that ONE\n\nDC lacks a sufficiently concrete injury-in-fact. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at\n\n31–35. “The Supreme Court has held that standing to bring an FHA claim is coextensive with\n\nconstitutional standing.” Nat’l Fair Hous.

Standing based on an organization’s own injury—“organizational\n\nstanding”—requires an organization, “like an individual plaintiff, to show actual or threatened\n\ninjury in fact that is fairly traceable to the alleged illegal action and likely to be redressed by a\n\nfavorable court decision.” Equal Rights Ctr. v.

As noted above, organizational standing requires a concrete injury,\n\nnot “a mere setback to [the organization’s] abstract social interests.” See Equal Rights Ctr., 633\n\nF.3d at 1138 (internal citations and quotations omitted). “An organization’s expenditure of\n\nresources on a lawsuit does not constitute an injury in fact sufficient to establish standing.” Id.\n\nHowever, it is “clear . . . that if the defendant’s allegedly wrongful action prompts an\n\norganization to ‘increase[] the resources [it] must devote to programs independent of its suit’ . . .\n\n, the organization has shown an injury in fact.” Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Spann v.\n\nColonial Vill., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538783\"><a href=\"/opinion/538783/girardeau-a-spann-v-colonial-village-inc-girardeau-a-spann-v-marvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). There is “an important limitation” on this\n\nprinciple: if an injury is “self-inflicted as a result of the organization’s own budgetary choices,”\n\nthe party cannot claim an injury-in-fact as a result of the defendant’s behavior. Id. at 1139\n\n(internal quotations omitted). This “does not automatically mean that [a party diverting\n\nresources] cannot suffer an injury sufficient to confer standing.” Id. at 1140. The crucial test for\n\ndetermining whether an injury is self-inflicted is whether the party “undertook the expenditures\n\nin response to, and to counteract, the effects of the defendants’ alleged discrimination rather than\n\nin anticipation of litigation.” Id. In the housing context, using resources for a program to\n\ncounteract a defendant’s discriminatory advertisement constitutes an adequate injury-in-fact,\n\nbecause it is used for the practical purpose of responding to allegedly illegal activity, not to\n\nprepare for litigation. See id. (citing Spann, 899 F.2d at 27–29). In Spann v. Colonial Village,\n\nInc., the plaintiff-organizations established standing when they alleged that the defendants’\n\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\f“preferential advertising tended to steer black home buyers and renters away from the advertised\n\ncomplexes,” requiring the plaintiffs to “devote more time, effort, and money to endeavors\n\ndesigned to educate not only home buyers and renters, but the DC area real estate industry.” 899\n\nF.2d at 27. So, if Defendants’ alleged actions frustrated ONE DC’s mission and ONE DC used\n\nresources to counteract that harm, it has standing to maintain the action. See Equal Rights Ctr.,\n\n633 F.3d at 1140.\n\n       Based on the facts alleged in the Complaint, ONE DC has standing to maintain this\n\naction. ONE DC is “comprised of members who include tenants of affordable housing\n\nproperties that are seeking to avoid displacement, preserve affordable housing, ensure fair\n\nhousing, and further equitable development in D.C.” Compl. ¶ 108. The alleged discrimination\n\nplainly frustrates ONE DC’s mission. Plaintiffs allege that ONE DC has had to divert its scarce\n\nresources away from its central mission to “crisis organizing” in the form of investigation,\n\ncounseling, organizing, canvassing, and other Brookland-specific programming. See id. ¶¶ 113–\n\n121. In all, Plaintiffs allege that, as of July 28, 2016, ONE DC has “diverted approximately 640\n\nhours of its staff members’ time to identify and combat Defendants’ discriminatory conduct\n\nthrough outreach, organizing, advocacy, and tenant counseling efforts.” Id. ¶ 121. This places\n\nONE DC’s case squarely within the holdings in Equal Rights Center and Spann. ONE DC did\n\nnot spend 640 hours concocting an injury in anticipation of litigation, but instead did so for the\n\npractical purpose of combating alleged discrimination in the community. Defendants’ alleged\n\ndiscrimination forced ONE DC to address an exigency in the community at the expense of its\n\nbroader social goals. Accordingly, ONE DC has sufficiently alleged organizational standing to\n\nwithstand Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f                            5. Failure to State Disparate Impact Claims\n\n       Defendants move to dismiss for failure to state a claim with respect to Plaintiffs’\n\ndisparate impact claims under the FHA and DCHRA. Defendants argue that Plaintiff\n\nerroneously assumes that “large families” are a protected group under the FHA, instead of the\n\nbroader protected class of “families.” Defendants further argue that without an FHA claim,\n\nPlaintiff cannot invoke supplemental jurisdiction to maintain its DCHRA claim. The Court will\n\naddress these arguments in turn.\n\n                                           Fair Housing Act\n\n       Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ FHA disparate impact claim for failure to state a\n\nclaim on the basis that Plaintiffs’ statistical analysis cherry-picks “large families” from the\n\nbroader “familial status,” and in so doing fails to analyze the effect that the entire redevelopment\n\nplan would have on all families that reside or will reside in the new community. See Defs.’\n\nMem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 11–12.\n\n\n       The Federal FHA prohibits “mak[ing] unavailable . . . a dwelling to any person because\n\nof . . . familial status.” See 42 U.S.C. 3604(a). “‘Familial status’ means one or more individuals\n\n(who have not attained the age of 18 years) being domiciled with . . . a parent or another person\n\nhaving legal custody of such . . . individuals,” or the parent’s designee. 42 U.S.C. 3602(k). It is\n\nimportant to note that the FHA is generally a repository of negative rights—it does not\n\naffirmatively provide special privileges to parents living with minor children, but rather protects\n\nthem from discriminatory acts.

Fenty, 650 F. App’x 42, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2016). HUD has adopted a\n\nburden-shifting framework for evaluating disparate impact claims. See 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c).\n\nFirst, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving that a challenged practice caused or predictably\n\nwill cause a discriminatory effect.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(1). Once the plaintiff makes such a\n\nshowing, the “defendant has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is necessary to\n\nachieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent or\n\ndefendant.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(2). If the defendant is able to do so, the “plaintiff may still\n\nprevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests supporting the\n\nchallenged practice could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.” 24\n\nC.F.R. § 100.500(c)(3).\n\n\n       To make an initial showing of disparate impact at “step one,” courts often rely on\n\nstatistical analyses. See, e.g., R.I. Comm’n for Human Rights v. Graul, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In Gashi, the court found a 30.76% effect on households with children and a\n\n9.88% effect on households without children sufficient to constitute a disparate impact. See 801\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 16–17. In Graul, the court found a threefold difference sufficient. See 120 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 126.\n\n\n       Defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs have not made a showing at\n\nstep one of HUD’s framework, because, according to Defendants, Plaintiffs’ statistical analysis\n\ninappropriately focuses on a particular subset of the protected class—large families—and a\n\nparticular aspect of the redevelopment—the elimination of larger-occupancy apartments. See\n\nDefs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 11–18. The Court will address these two\n\ncontentions in turn.\n\n\n                            i.    “Familial Status” vs. “Large Families”\n\n\n       Defendants’ first qualm with Plaintiffs’ reasoning is that it relies on discrimination\n\nagainst large families rather than families as a protected group. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of\n\nMot. to Dismiss, at 9. As noted above, the FHA protects all families, as defined by statute,\n\nregardless of size. Courts have consistently assumed that “‘[f]amilial status’ refers to the\n\npresence of minor children in the household.” See Gilligan v. Jamco Dev. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737022\"><a href=\"/opinion/737022/catherine-gilligan-maurice-gilligan-david-gilligan-and-wayne-gilligan/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n247 (9th Cir. 1997); see also Graul, 120 F.

So, although there is no special\n\ntreatment for “large families” under the FHA, they are still protected under the umbrella of\n\n“families” if minors are in the household.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f       Although Plaintiffs do repeatedly refer to “large families” in their Complaint, their\n\nstatistical analysis specifically concerns “those who have one or more minor children living in\n\nthe household.” See Compl. ¶¶ 72, 37. Similarly, Plaintiffs define their proposed class as “[a]ll\n\nhouseholds who reside or have resided at Brookland Manor in a three-, four- or five[-]bedroom\n\nunit with one or more minor child.” See id. ¶ 122. Plaintiffs’ statistical analysis includes\n\napartments of all sizes, comparing those with minor children to those without them. See id. ¶ 75.\n\nUsing that metric, Plaintiffs arrive at the conclusion that the proposed redevelopment would\n\nadversely affect 59% of families overall, compared to 15% of nonfamilies. See id. ¶ 77. It does\n\nnot matter that many of the protected individuals are part of “large families” for the purpose of\n\nthe Complaint, so long as the unprotected group and protected group are correctly defined.\n\nBecause the Complaint shows that Plaintiffs do correctly define these groups, Plaintiffs did not\n\n“cherry-pick” protected families from the larger protected class.\n\n\n               ii.   The Elimination of Large Apartments vs. the Project as a Whole\n\n\n       Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs fail to take into account “all families that reside or\n\nwill reside in the revitalized community,” citing Boykin v. Gray. See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of\n\nMot. to Dismiss, at 11 (second emphasis added). In Boykin, a group of homeless men claimed\n\nthat the District of Columbia’s closure of a particular homeless shelter violated the FHA, because\n\na disproportionate amount of the D.C. homeless population is black and Hispanic. See 986 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 14, 16 (D.D.C. 2013). The closure of the homeless shelter was part of a “broader shift\n\nin the District’s policy toward its homeless citizens” that had a net-positive impact on the\n\nminority population in the District. Id. at 21. Applying a disparate-impact standard, that court\n\nfound that “[t]he fundamental defect in the plaintiffs’ argument is that the adverse impact of\n\nwhich they complain was suffered not by the entire homeless population in the District of\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fColumbia, nor even by a significant portion of its more than 6,000 members.” See id. at 20.\n\nClosing the specific shelter affected 90 people, but the overall number of beds available to\n\nhomeless persons rose as a result of the District’s program. See id. at 20–21. By referring to “its\n\nhomeless citizens,” “the entire homeless population in the District of Columbia,” and “its 6,000\n\nmembers,” the above excerpts show that the court was interested in the District of Columbia’s\n\noverall universe of homeless persons.\n\n\n       In the context of a private landlord, courts are similarly concerned with the private\n\nparty’s universe of tenants. In Betsey v. Turtle Creek Associates, the tenants of a particular\n\nbuilding contended that a policy would have a disparate racial impact on them as individuals.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437256\"><a href=\"/opinion/437256/charles-and-dianne-betsey-carroll-m-adams-richard-and-jean-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 985–87 (4th Cir. 1984). Because the plaintiffs did not show a “continuing\n\ndisproportionate impact,” a sufficient racial impact of the entire complex, or any impact on the\n\nlocal community, the district court dismissed the claim. See id. at 986–87. Reversing, the\n\nFourth Circuit held that “members of a discrete minority[] are required to prove only that a given\n\npolicy had a discriminatory impact on them as individuals.” Id. at 987. That court found\n\n“consideration of the rest of the local community, the rest of [the residential community], or even\n\nprospective applicants for space in [the building] irrelevant.” See id. (internal quotations\n\nomitted). “The correct inquiry is whether the policy in question had a disproportionate impact on\n\nthe minorities in the total group to which the policy was applied.” Id.\n\n\n       Here, it does not matter that the redevelopment might open up space for families in the\n\nlocal community to occupy smaller apartments at the redeveloped project. Defendants’ universe\n\nof persons are the existing tenants at Brookland Manor. If the current families of Brookland\n\nManor are disparately impacted by the redevelopment, it is irrelevant that some protected\n\npersons in the local community might end up filling their shoes in units that could not support\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fthem. Plaintiffs do analyze the effect that the entire project will have on all existing tenants of\n\nBrookland Manor. See Compl. ¶¶ 75–79. Given that Plaintiffs adequately allege that the\n\nproposed redevelopment project will affect Brookland Manor families over three times as much\n\nas it will nonfamilies, they state a claim.\n\n\n                                         D.C. Human Rights Act\n\n       Defendants’ only contention specific to the DCHRA is that “elimination of [Plaintiffs’]\n\nfederal claims would dictate dismissal of the rest of their claims as failing the test for\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction.” See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 18 n.7. Even if\n\ntrue, the Court simply notes that, as set forth above, it is not dismissing the federal-question\n\nclaims under the federal FHA, so supplemental jurisdiction remains.\n\n                       B. Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n\n       Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants from proceeding with\n\ntheir redevelopment plan.9 “To warrant preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must\n\nshow (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable\n\ninjury if the injunction were not granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure\n\nother interested parties, and (4) that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”\n\nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v.

The moving party must also show that the threatened injury is “beyond\n\nremediation” with other forms of relief. See Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at\n\n297.\n\n       Plaintiffs argue that the threatened injuries are imminent, because when Defendants\n\nreceive Stage Two approval, they will be free to commence destruction of Plaintiffs’ homes. See\n\nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 26. Specifically, they argue that “D.C. Municipal\n\nRegulations make clear that second-stage approval is the final step before a redeveloper may\n\ncommence demolition.” See id. They further argue that Defendants have already required\n\nfamilies who reside in large units to “relocate, break up, and downsize.” See id. In support of\n\ntheir assertion, Plaintiffs cite to several declarations of tenants who claim to know others at\n\nBrookland Manor who have been forced to move. See id. at 27; McFadden Decl. ¶ 6; Jenkins\n\nDecl. ¶ 6; Scott Decl. ¶ 6. However, they do not cite to any first-hand account of a family who\n\nhas been forced to relocate off the property, nor any family who has been told they will need to\n\nrelocate but will be unable to do so on the property.10\n\n\n\n       10\n           Plaintiffs’ argument that a recent submission to the Zoning Commission shows that the\nfirst block to be demolished contains almost all three- and four-bedroom apartments is\nunavailing. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for a Prelim. Inj., at 13, ECF No. 20. If, as\n\n\n                                                 36\n\f       Defendants argue that any displacement would not occur until years in the future. See\n\nDefs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., at 6. Michael Meers, Vice President of Defendant\n\nMid-City Financial Corporation, has stated that demolition will not commence until late 2017, at\n\nthe earliest, because of the length of time it takes to receive Stage Two approval and then obtain\n\nthe requisite permits to begin the project. See Meers Aff. ¶ 17. Moreover, because the existing\n\nbuildings are collateral on a HUD loan until August 1, 2017, it is “highly unlikely” that\n\nDefendants could begin demolition any earlier.11 See id. ¶ 21. Even then, the project will be\n\nlimited to “Phase One,” meaning that only three of the 19 buildings will be demolished. See id.\n\n¶ 17. Later phases will not begin until 2019, and neither individual Plaintiff will need to vacate\n\nuntil 2020, at the earliest. See id. ¶¶ 17–19. When the buildings are demolished during Phase\n\nOne, Michael Meers asserts that all residents in those buildings will be “relocated at owner\n\nexpense to an appropriate apartment home on the property.” See id. ¶ 17 (emphasis added). Mr.\n\nMeers further declares that, although some tenants have been moved, none have been unable to\n\nrelocate at Brookland Manor. See id. Citing to HUD guidelines and the D.C. Office of\n\nPlanning’s finding that the D.C. Zoning Commission cited favorably, Defendants’ own numbers\n\n\nthey argue, Defendants have already relocated “the overwhelming majority of [that block’s]\nresidents,” id. at 12 they should be even more capable of providing the Court with something in\nthe record to show that a family has been relocated and unable to move into another apartment\non the property. If anything, this supports Defendants’ argument that all families who will be\nrelocated from Block 7 will be able to relocate on the property. But even more to the point, the\nsubmission that Plaintiffs reference refers specifically to Block 7. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp.\nof Mot. for Prelim. Inj. Ex. 3, at 1, ECF No. 20-3. The D.C. Zoning Commission knew that\nBlock 7 was going to be demolished during Phase One, yet still credited a report that the larger\nunits would not be phased out until the later stages of redevelopment. See Mid-City Fin. Corp.,\nZ.C. Case 14-18, at 38, 50.\n       11\n            For the same reasons noted in note 10, Plaintiffs’ arguments about relocation occurring\nwell in advance of demolition are unavailing. See Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for a\nPrelim. Inj., at 13. Although it is obviously true that relocation must occur before demolition,\nthis fact, if anything, shows that Defendants are capable of relocating tenants to other locations\non the property.\n\n\n                                                37\n\fshow that only 13 Brookland Manor households would currently require a four-bedroom\n\napartment, and none would require a five-bedroom apartment.12 See Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C.\n\nCase 14-18, at 38. The same finding from the D.C. Office of Planning noted that “[t]he building\n\nwith the larger units would remain on the site until the later phases at which time they can be\n\n‘right sized’ to accommodate the larger families.” Id.\n\n       Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any families—let alone a disproportionate\n\nnumber of them—are facing the imminent threat of being forced to relocate until well after the\n\ncase can be fully adjudicated. Plaintiffs do not, for example, point to a particular family that\n\nlives in the block of houses scheduled to be demolished during Phase One that would be unable\n\nto move into an apartment elsewhere at Brookland Manor. Although Plaintiffs cite to certain\n\nsecond-hand sources alluding to the idea of relocation, see, e.g., Jenkins Decl., Defendants cite to\n\nspecific attributes of the redevelopment project showing otherwise. The Vice President of Mid-\n\nCity has stated that it is “highly unlikely” that Phase One could begin until August, 2017, and\n\nthat it would be much more likely to begin later in 2017. And, assuring the Court that the harm\n\nis not imminent even further into the future, he states that no resident will be forced to move\n\naway from Brookland Manor during Stage One, leaving the Plaintiffs with no ground to stand on\n\nuntil Stage Two, which is at least three years away. This makes sense in the context of\n\nDefendants’ contention that many families are in apartments that are too large, that the building\n\nwith larger units will remain until later phases of redevelopment, and that vacancies currently\n\nexist that can be used to house displaced households from Block 7.13 The situations of individual\n\n\n       12\n          Plaintiffs are correct that D.C. occupancy law may make this number higher in certain\ncases. However, they do not tell the Court how frequently this is the case, or otherwise carry\ntheir burden of showing the extent of the issues in light of Defendants’ evidence.\n       13\n         It is worth noting that although Plaintiffs’ methodology is plausible for HUD’s “step\none” showing of disparate impact at the motion-to-dismiss stage, it comes up short in showing\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fPlaintiffs give the Court further assurance: there are no plans that would require Ms. Borum to\n\nrelocate until 2020 at the earliest or Ms. Holloman until 2023. Even if the proposed class were\n\ncertified here, vague stories and misgivings from tenants are insufficient for Plaintiffs to shoulder\n\ntheir burden of showing that an irreparable injury will likely occur if the Court waits to\n\nadjudicate the dispute on the merits. Although it is certainly possible that Defendants’ plans\n\ncould change by moving the process up considerably, Plaintiffs have not met the “high standard”\n\nof showing that they imminently face their alleged injuries. The chance that the timeline moves\n\nup, disparate impact will occur at Phase One, or Plaintiffs will otherwise suffer injury does not\n\nrise to the level of a “clear and present threat” necessary for a showing of irreparable injury.\n\nBecause some showing of imminent irreparable injury is required for the issuance of a\n\npreliminary injunction, the Court must deny Plaintiffs’ motion.\n\n        If Plaintiffs do obtain evidence showing that imminent injury is likely to occur, the\n\nMotion can be renewed and will be reconsidered in light of such new evidence. And, because\n\nDefendants applied for Stage Two PUD approval ahead of schedule and stop short of\n\nguaranteeing that they will follow the timeline set forth in their declarations, the Court will\n\nimpose on Defendants a requirement to report to the Court and Plaintiffs any changes in schedule\n\n\n\n\nthat “families”—as defined by the FHA—will necessarily be forced to relocate away from the\nproperty at a disproportionate rate during the later stages of redevelopment. As noted above and\nshown by a plain reading of the statutory text, the FHA protects only minor children living with\nparents (or similar guardians). See 42 U.S.C. § 3602(k). The definition of “family” does not, for\nexample, “encompass groups of more than one family.” Doe v. City of Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534206\"><a href=\"/opinion/534206/joan-doe-mary-roe-and-susan-loe-on-their-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-all/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326\n(3d Cir. 1989) (Roth, J., dissenting). Thus, a group of people cannot talismanically receive\nprotection under the FHA just because one of them happens to be a parent domiciled with a\nminor child. Although the Court need not reach the issue given the lack of imminent irreparable\ninjury, in light of the fact that all tenants will eventually have to relocate to different units on the\nproperty, see Mid-City Fin. Corp., Z.C. Case 14-18, at 2 (noting that all the existing buildings\nwill be replaced), the Court queries whether breaking up groups of people—including extended\nfamilies—into separate apartments will necessarily disparately impact “families.”\n\n\n                                                  39\n\fthat might make displacement of tenants at Brookland Manor more imminent than it was when\n\nthey made their declarations in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.\n\n\n                                      IV.
