Last fall, the Forum for Academic and\nInstitutional Rights, Inc. (“FAIR”), 1 an association of law\n\n\n  1\n  Joining FAIR in its preliminary injunction motion and in this\nappeal are: the Society for Law Teachers, Inc.; the Coalition for\nEquality; Rutgers Gay and Lesbian Caucus; law professors\nErwin Chemerinsky and Sylvia Law; and law students Pam\nNickisher, Leslie Fischer, Ph.D., and Michael Blauschild. For\nconvenience, we refer to all plaintiff-appellants collectively as\n“FAIR.”\n\n                               6\n\fschools and law faculty, asked the United States District\nCourt for the District of New Jersey to enjoin enforcement of\nthe Solomon Amendment. The District Court denied FAIR’s\nmotion. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc. v.\nRumsfeld, 291 F. Supp. 2d 269 (D.N.J. 2003) (“FAIR”). On\nappeal, we hold that FAIR has demonstrated a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of its First Amendment claims and that\nit is entitled to preliminary injunctive relief. Accordingly, we\nreverse.\n\n         I.   Background Facts 2 and Procedural Posture\n\nA.        Law Schools’ Nondiscrimination Policies\n\n       Law schools have long maintained formal policies of\nnondiscrimination that withhold career placement services\nfrom employers who exclude employees and applicants based\non such factors as race, gender, and religion. In the 1970s law\nschools began expanding these policies to prohibit\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation as well. In\nresponse to this trend the American Association of Law\nSchools (“AALS”) voted unanimously in 1990 to include\nsexual orientation as a protected category. As a result,\n\n\n     2\n    The facts on appeal are not in dispute. As the District Court\nnoted, the Government did not challenge or supplement the\nfactual assertions presented by FAIR in its motion for injunctive\nrelief. FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 277.\n\n                               7\n\fvirtually every law school now has a comprehensive policy\nlike the following:\n\n         [The] School of Law is committed to a policy of\n         equal opportunity for all students and graduates.\n         The Career Services facilities of this school\n         shall not be available to those employers who\n         discriminate on the grounds of race, color,\n         religion, national origin, sex, handicap or\n         disability, age, or sexual orientation . . . .\n         Before using any of the Career Services\n         interviewing facilities of this school, an\n         employer shall be required to submit a signed\n         statement certifying that its practices conform to\n         this policy.\n\nB.       Congress Passes the Solomon Amendment\n\n       The United States military excludes servicemembers\nbased on evidence of homosexual conduct and/or orientation.\nSee 10 U.S.C. § 654.3 Citing their nondiscrimination policies,\n\n\n     3\n      While the current statutory version of the military’s\nexclusionary policy has existed since 1993, National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-160, §\n571(a)(1), 107 Stat. 1547, 1670 (Nov. 30, 1993), the military has\nhad formal regulatory policies excluding gays and lesbians since\nWorld War I and a practice of such exclusion since the\n\n                                 8\n\fsome law schools began in the 1980s refusing to provide\naccess and assistance to military recruiters. This caught the\nattention of members of Congress. In 1994, Representative\nGerald Solomon of New York sponsored an amendment to\nthe annual defense appropriation bill that proposed to\nwithhold DOD funding from any educational institution with\na policy of denying or effectively preventing the military from\nobtaining entry to campuses (or access to students on\ncampuses) for recruiting purposes. National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Pub. L. No. 103-337\n\n\n\nRevolutionary War. See, e.g., Articles of War of 1916, Pub. L.\nNo. 242, art. 93, 39 Stat. 619, 664 (assault with intent to commit\nsodomy punishable by court martial); see generally Randy\nShilts, Conduct Unbecoming: Gays & Lesbians in the U.S.\nMilitary 11–17 (1994).\n        Under the current statute, a servicemember is separated\nfrom the military if it is found that he or she “engaged in . . . a\nhomosexual act” or “stated that he or she is a homosexual” or\n“married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the\nsame biological sex.” 10 U.S.C. § 654(b). It defines\n“homosexual” and “homosexual act” to include evidence\ndemonstrating “a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual\nacts.” Id. It also allows servicemembers to rebut findings of\nproscribed conduct with evidence of the lack of a propensity to\nengage in homosexual conduct, i.e., evidence of a heterosexual\norientation. Id. Law schools interpret the ban as conflicting\nwith their policies against discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation.\n\n                                9\n\f§ 558, 108 Stat. 2663, 2776 (1994).\n\n        During debate in the House of Representatives,\nRepresentative Solomon urged the passage of his amendment\n“on behalf of military preparedness” because “recruiting is the\nkey to an all-volunteer military.” 140 Cong. Rec. H3861\n(daily ed. May 23, 1994). He argued that it was hypocritical\nfor schools to receive federal money while at the same time\ndenying the military access to their campuses: “[T]ell[]\nrecipients of Federal money at colleges and universities that if\nyou do not like the Armed Forces, if you do not like its\npolicies, that is fine. That is your [F]irst [A]mendment\nright[]. But do not expect Federal dollars to support your\ninterference with our military recruiters.” Id. The\namendment’s co-sponsor, Representative Richard Pombo of\nCalifornia, said Congress needed to target “policies of\nambivalence or hostility to our Nation’s armed services” that\nare “nothing less than a backhanded slap at the honor and\ndignity of service in our Nation’s Armed Forces.” Id. at\nH3863. He urged his colleagues to “send a message over the\nwall of the ivory tower of higher education” that colleges’ and\nuniversities’ “starry-eyed idealism comes with a price. If they\nare too good—or too righteous—to treat our Nation’s military\nwith the respect it deserves[,] then they may also be too good\nto receive the generous level of taxpayer dollars presently\nenjoyed by many institutions of higher education in America.”\nId.\n\n\n\n                              10\n\f        Other Representatives opposed the amendment,\nalleging violations of academic freedom and civil rights. See,\ne.g., id. at H3862 (Rep. Dellums) (“We should not . . . chill or\nabridge privacy, speech, or conscience by threatening a\ncollege with a Federal funds termination because it chose for\nwhatever reason to deny access to military recruiters . . . . We\nshould not browbeat them . . . into becoming involuntary\nagents of Federal policy.”). In light of Vietnam War-era\nlegislation, rarely invoked, that already granted the DOD\ndiscretion to withhold funding from colleges and universities\nthat barred military recruiters, see Pub. L. No. 92-436, § 606,\n86 Stat. 734, 740 (1972), the DOD itself objected to the\nproposed amendment as “unnecessary” and “duplicative.” 140\nCong. Rec. H3864 (Rep. Schroeder) (explaining the DOD’s\nposition). The DOD also feared that withholding funds from\nuniversities could be potentially harmful to defense research\ninitiatives. Id. But the House voted for the amendment by a\nvote of 271 to 126. Id. at H3865. Several months later the\nSenate approved the defense spending appropriations bill,\nincluding Representative Solomon’s amendment, and the\n“Solomon Amendment” ultimately became law.\n\nC.     Subsequent Amendments and Regulatory\n       Interpretations\n\n       In 1997 Congress amended the Solomon Amendment\nby expanding its penalty to include, in addition to DOD funds,\nfunds administered by other federal agencies, including the\n\n                              11\n\fDepartments of Transportation,4 Labor, Health and Human\nServices, and Education.5 Omnibus Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 1997, Pub. L. No. 104–208, § 514(b),\n110 Stat. 3009–270 (1996). This amendment was recodified\nin another amendment in 1999. National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, Pub. L. No. 106–65,\n§ 549, 113 Stat. 512, 609–11 (1999). DOD regulations have\nclarified this expansion, penalizing an offending\n“subelement” of a college or university (i.e., a law school)\nthat prohibits or effectively prevents military recruiting with\nthe loss of federal funding from all of the federal agencies\nidentified in the statute, while withholding from the offending\nsubelement’s parent institution only DOD funds. 32 C.F.R. §\n216.3(b)(1).\n\n       The 1999 amendment also codified exceptions to the\nSolomon Amendment’s penalties for schools that (1) have\nceased an offending policy or practice, or (2) have a\nlongstanding religious-based policy of pacifism. § 549, 113\n\n\n\n    4\n     Department of Homeland Security funds later replaced\nDepartment of Transportation funds. Pub. L. No. 107-296,\n§ 1704(b)(1), 116 Stat. 2314 (2002).\n    5\n     A separate amendment cancelled the application of the\nSolomon Amendment to direct student aid. Department of\nDefense Appropriations Act of 2000, § 8120, Pub. L. No. 106-\n79, 113 Stat. 1212, 1260 (1999).\n\n                              12\n\fStat. at 610(c) (codified at 10 U.S.C. § 983(c)). DOD\nregulations subsequently added a third exception for schools\nthat provide military recruiters a degree of access equal to that\nprovided to other recruiters. 32 C.F.R. § 216.4(c).\n\n        Following the 1999 amendment, the DOD enforced the\nSolomon Amendment consistent with its terms. Only schools\nwhose policies or practices “prohibit[ed], or in effect\nprevent[ed],” military representatives “from gaining entry to\ncampuses, or access to students . . . on campuses for purposes\nof military recruiting,” were penalized. Thus, by merely\nallowing military recruiters to gain access to campuses, many\nlaw schools avoided the Solomon Amendment’s penalty while\nreaffirming their opposition to the military’s exclusionary\nemployment policy by not providing them affirmative\nassistance in the manner provided to other recruiters. Harvard\nLaw School, for example, allowed military recruiters on\ncampus to recruit at the offices of its Veterans Association but\ndid not volunteer its placement personnel to arrange\ninterviews. Boston College Law School allowed military\nrecruiters to conduct on-campus interviews, but kept their\nliterature in the library rather than in the career services\noffice. Until the fall of 2001, the DOD did not consider these\nand other similar “ameliorative measures” to violate the\nSolomon Amendment and expressed enthusiasm for the law\nschools’ cooperation with what it described as successful\nrecruiting efforts. See FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 282 (citing\nrecord evidence).\n\n                               13\n\f        But following the terrorist attacks in the United States\nin September 2001, the DOD began applying an informal\npolicy of requiring not only access to campuses, but treatment\nequal to that accorded other recruiters. As evidence of this\ninformal policy, a letter from the DOD’s Acting Deputy\nUndersecretary William J. Carr to Richard Levin, the\nPresident of Yale University, stated that universities are\nrequired “to provide military recruiters access to students\nequal in quality and scope to that provided to other\nrecruiters.” 6 The same letter stated that the “DOD requires\nthat there not be a substantial disparity in the treatment of\nmilitary recruiters as compared to other potential employers.”\nThis changed context meant that Yale’s willingness to let\nmilitary recruiters use a room in Yale Law School’s building\nfor interviews would not pass muster unless it also provided\nmilitary recruiters with the same level of assistance from its\ncareer development office (arranging interviews, posting\nnotices, etc.) provided to other recruiters. Furthermore, the\nDOD intimated that failure to comply would result in a loss to\n\n\n      6\n       In wording the new informal policy’s substantive\nrequirement, the DOD borrowed language from the existing\npolicy’s regulatory exception—32 C.F.R. 216.4(c) (exempting\nfrom Solomon Act compliance a law school that “presents\nevidence that the degree of access by military recruiters is at\nleast equal in quality and scope to that afforded to other\nemployers”).\n\n\n                               14\n\fYale University not only of DOD funds, but of all federal\nfunds (a penalty that is not consistent with the DOD’s existing\nregulations, under which the offending subelement’s parent\ninstitution is penalized with the loss of only DOD funds, see\n32 C.F.R. § 216.3(b)(1)).\n\n        In another example, the DOD advised the University of\nSouthern California Law School in 2002 that its past practice\nof accommodating military recruiters—providing them with\nstandard employer information, referring them to the campus\nROTC office for scheduling of interview office space, posting\nnotices in the weekly newsletter for students, and making\nmilitary recruitment materials available to students—would\nviolate the Solomon Amendment unless its career services\noffice invited military recruiters to participate in an off-\ncampus job fair open to other employers. According to the\nDOD, anything less than equal treatment for military\nrecruiters “sends the message that employment in the Armed\nForces is less honorable or desirable than employment with\nother organizations”—a dangerous message to be sending “in\ntoday’s military climate.” In light of the millions of dollars at\nstake, every law school that receives federal funds had, by the\n2003 recruiting season, suspended its nondiscrimination\npolicy as applied to military recruiters.\n\n      This past summer Congress amended the Solomon\nAmendment to codify the DOD’s informal policy. Ronald W.\nReagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year\n\n                               15\n\f2005, Pub. L. No. 108–375, § 552, 118 Stat. 1811, 1911\n(2004). Now, under the terms of the statute itself, law schools\nand their parent institutions are penalized for preventing\nmilitary representatives from gaining entry to campuses for\nthe purpose of military recruiting “in a manner that is at least\nequal in quality and scope to the [degree of] access to\ncampuses and to students that is provided to any other\nemployer.” 10 U.S.C. § 983(b).\n\nD.     Current Litigation\n\n       In September 2003, FAIR sued the DOD and the other\nfederal departments whose funds are restricted under the\nSolomon Amendment, seeking on constitutional grounds a\npreliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the statute\nand the then-existing (now codified) informal policy. The\nGovernment defendants moved to dismiss for lack of\nstanding. The District Court denied both the motion to\ndismiss and FAIR’s motion for preliminary injunction. See\nFAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 296, 322. This appeal followed.\n\n                      II.

Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 156 n.12 (3d Cir.\n\n\n\n                              16\n\f2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 942 (2003).7 Our appellate\njurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\n\n                         III.   Analysis\n\n        To obtain a preliminary injunction FAIR must establish\n(1) a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits, (2)\nirreparable harm absent the injunction, (3) that the harm to\nFAIR absent the injunction outweighs the harm to the\nGovernment of granting it, and (4) that the injunction serves\n\n\n  7\n    Standing must also be proper for subject matter jurisdiction\nto exist. See, e.g., Storino v. Borough of Point Pleasant Beach,\n322 F.3d 293, 296 (3d Cir. 2003); Charles Alan Wright &\nArthur R. Miller et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 3531\n(2d ed. 1984). The District Court held that FAIR had standing\nto seek a preliminary injunction against the Solomon\nAmendment, and the Government has conceded this issue on\nappeal. Acknowledging our continuing obligation to verify\nsubject matter jurisdiction when it is in question, see, e.g., Exxon\nMobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 364 F.3d 102, 104 (3d\nCir.), cert. granted on other grounds, No. 03-1696, 125 S. Ct.\n310 (2004), we affirm the District Court’s holding that FAIR’s\nstanding was proper for the reasons it provided. FAIR, 291 F.\nSupp. 2d at 285–91.\n        While the Government does not concede that the non-\nFAIR plaintiffs had standing, the presence of one plaintiff with\nstanding is sufficient to satisfy that requirement. Bowsher v.\nSynar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986).\n\n                                17\n\fthe public interest. Tenafly Eruv Ass’n, 309 F.3d at 157.\nWhile we review a district court’s balancing of the\npreliminary injunction factors for abuse of discretion, we\nreview “any determination that is a prerequisite to the\nissuance of an injunction . . . according to the standard\napplicable to that particular determination.” Id. at 156\n(citations omitted). Thus, because the District Court’s ruling\nwas based on its application of the First Amendment and\nother constitutional principles to the Solomon\nAmendment—issues of law to which a plenary standard of\nreview applies— our review is plenary. Id.\n\nA.     Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine\n\n      FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment is an\nunconstitutional condition.8 Under the unconstitutional\n\n  8\n    Our dissenting colleague urges us to begin our analysis with\nthe presumption that congressional statutes are constitutional.\nIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that, when\nthere are “‘two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of\nwhich it would unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain\nduty is to adopt that which will save the Act.’” Rust v. Sullivan,\n500 U.S. 173, 190 (1991) (quoting Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S.\n142, 148 (1927)). But in this case it is not argued that there are\ntwo possible constructions of the Solomon Amendment. The\ncanons of statutory construction therefore do not apply.\nMoreover, “although a duly enacted statute normally carries\nwith it a presumption of constitutionality, when a [statute]\n\n                               18\n\fconditions doctrine, the Government “may not deny a benefit\nto a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally\nprotected interests—especially, his interest in freedom of\nspeech.” Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). If\nCongress “could deny a benefit to a person because of his\nconstitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise\nof those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited.”\nId. Put another way, the Government may not propose a\npenalty to “produce a result which [it] could not command\ndirectly.” Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526 (1958) (state\ncould not condition property tax exemption on loyalty oath);\nsee also Rosenberger v. Rectors & Visitors of the Univ. of Va.,\n515 U.S. 819 (1995) (public university could not condition\nfunds for student publications on their secular perspective);\nFCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364 (1984) (FCC\ncould not condition federal funds to radio stations on editorial\ncontent). Thus, if the law schools’ compliance with the\nSolomon Amendment compromises their First Amendment\nrights, the statute is an unconstitutional condition.9\n\n\nallegedly infringes on the exercise of [F]irst [A]mendment\nrights, the statute’s proponent bears the burden of establishing\n[its] constitutionality.” ACORN v. City of Frontenac, 714 F.2d\n813, 817 (8th Cir. 1983) (citing Org. for a Better Austin v.\nKeefe, 402 U.S. 415, 419 (1971)).\n  9\n    As the District Court noted, the Supreme Court’s exception\nto the unconstitutional conditions doctrine for selective spending\nprograms does not apply here. FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n                               19\n\fB.     First Amendment Analysis\n\n       The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S.\nConst. amend. I. This simple commandment plays out\ndifferently depending on the avenue of analysis. Two\navenues applicable here are: (1) whether the law schools are\n“expressive associations” whose First Amendment right to\ndisseminate their chosen message is impaired by the inclusion\nof military recruiters on their campuses; and (2) whether the\nlaw schools are insulated by free speech protections from\nbeing compelled to assist military recruiters in the expressive\n\n\n\n\n299–300. When the Government appropriates for a particular\nspending program, it may endorse one viewpoint over another\nby conditioning its spending on certain criteria. United States v.\nAm. Library Ass’n, 539 U.S. 194, 211 (2003) (providing library\nassistance funds to only those libraries who agree to block\nobscene Internet sites); Rust, 500 U.S. at 192–93 (funding\nfamily planning services that eschew abortion counseling). In\nthose cases, “the Government [was] not denying a benefit to\nanyone, but [was] instead simply insisting that public funds be\nspent for the purposes for which they were authorized.” Rust,\n500 U.S. at 196; see also Am. Library Ass’n, 539 U.S. at 211.\nThat exception does not apply in our case because the Solomon\nAmendment does not create a spending program; it merely\nimposes a penalty—the loss of general funds.\n\n                               20\n\fact of recruiting.10\n\n        A violation of freedom of speech under either\nanalytical approach draws down the curtain on Solomon\nAmendment enforcement unless the Government can\nestablish that the statute withstands strict scrutiny. The levels\nof scrutiny applicable in the First Amendment context are\ncrucial. A regulation that disrupts an expressive association\nor compels speech must be narrowly tailored to serve a\ncompelling governmental interest, and must use the least\nrestrictive means of promoting the Government’s asserted\ninterest (here, recruiting talented lawyers). See infra Parts\n\n\n   10\n     FAIR also argues that the Solomon Amendment and the\nthen-existing informal policy are void under the First\nAmendment’s vagueness doctrine because they provide\ninsufficient notice as to what activities will trigger funding\npenalties. But the statutory amendment enacted during FAIR’s\npending appeal, see supra Part I.C, has rendered moot both the\nchallenge to the Solomon Amendment, see Black United Fund\nof N.J., Inc. v. Kean, 763 F.2d 156, 160 (3d Cir. 1985), and the\nchallenge to the regulatory policy, see Prometheus Radio\nProject, Inc. v. FCC, 373 F.3d 372, 396 (3d Cir. 2004). The\nrecent amendment to the Solomon Amendment does not,\nhowever, moot FAIR’s other challenges to it. See Northeastern\nFla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City\nof Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 662 (1993) (stating that a\nchallenge to a statute is not moot when the new version of it\n“disadvantages [appellants] in the same fundamental way”).\n\n                               21\n\fIII.B.1(c), 2(e). Needless to say, this is an imposing barrier.\n\n       The District Court, by contrast, emphasized a third\npotential theory of this case that invokes only intermediate\nscrutiny, i.e., whether the government action at issue furthers\nan important government interest that would be achieved less\neffectively without that action. The Court asked whether the\nlaw schools’ resistance to the Solomon Amendment is\nsufficiently communicative to bring it within the ambit of the\nFirst Amendment’s protection for “expressive conduct,” the\nsuppression of which receives intermediate scrutiny under\nUnited States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968). See infra Part\nIII.B.3(b). We emphasize at the outset that we need not\ndecide this issue because we conclude that the Solomon\nAmendment violates the First Amendment by impeding the\nlaw schools’ rights of expressive association and by\ncompelling them to assist in the expressive act of recruiting.\nNonetheless, we explain briefly our conclusion that FAIR\nwould prevail even under O’Brien’s less strict framework.\n\n       1.     Expressive Association\n\n       FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment impairs\nlaw schools’ First Amendment rights under the doctrine of\nexpressive association. The Supreme Court most recently\naddressed this doctrine in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530\nU.S. 640 (2000). There the Court held that a state public\naccommodations law that prohibited discrimination based on\n\n                               22\n\fsexual orientation could not constitutionally be invoked to\nforce the Boy Scouts to accept openly gay James Dale as an\nassistant scoutmaster. Id. at 659. Central to its analysis was\nthe deference it gave to the Boy Scouts’ “view of what would\nimpair its expression,” which compelled the Court’s\nconclusion that Dale’s presence would “significantly burden\nthe Boy Scouts’ desire to not ‘promote homosexual conduct\nas a legitimate form of behavior.’” Id. at 653 (citation\nomitted).\n\n       Under Dale, the elements of an expressive association\nclaim are (1) whether the group is an “expressive\nassociation,” (2) whether the state action at issue significantly\naffects the group’s ability to advocate its viewpoint, and (3)\nwhether the state’s interest justifies the burden it imposes on\nthe group’s expressive association. Id. at 648–58; accord\nThe Circle School v. Pappert, 381 F.3d 172, 181-82 (3d Cir.\n2004) (applying the Dale framework); Pi Lambda Phi\nFraternity, Inc. v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 229 F.3d 435, 442 (3d\nCir. 2000) (same). We apply each in turn to analyze FAIR’s\nexpressive association claim.\n\n              (a)    The law schools are expressive\n                     associations.\n\n       A group that engages in some form of public or private\nexpression above a de minimis threshold is an “expressive\nassociation.” Pi Lambda Phi, 229 F.3d at 443. The group\n\n                               23\n\fneed not be an advocacy group or exist primarily for the\npurpose of expression. Dale, 530 U.S. at 648. The Supreme\nCourt held that the Boy Scouts, which “seeks to transmit . . . a\nsystem of values, engages in expressive activity.” Id. at 650.\n\n       “By nature, educational institutions are highly\nexpressive organizations, as their philosophy and values are\ndirectly inculcated in their students.” The Circle School, 381\nF.3d at 182. Because FAIR has shown that the law schools\n“possess[] clear educational philosophies, missions and\ngoals,” id., we agree with the District Court’s conclusion that\nthey qualify as expressive associations. FAIR, 291 F. Supp.\n2d at 303–04. Therefore, FAIR satisfies the first element of\nthe Dale analysis.\n\n              (b)    The Solomon Amendment significantly\n                     affects the law schools’ ability to express\n                     their viewpoint.\n\n       FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment\nsignificantly affects law schools’ ability to express their\nviewpoint, reflected in their policies, that discrimination on\nthe basis of sexual orientation is wrong. The Solomon\nAmendment compels them, they contend, to disseminate the\nopposite message. The schools believe that, by coordinating\ninterviews and posting and publishing recruiting notices of an\nemployer who discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation,\nthey impair their ability to teach an inclusive message by\n\n                               24\n\fexample. Put another way, FAIR maintains that the Solomon\nAmendment suppresses the law schools’ chosen speech by\ninterfering with their prerogative to shape the way they\neducate (including, of course, the manner in which they\ncommunicate their message).\n\n       In Dale, the Supreme Court recognized that “[t]he\nforced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group” could\nsignificantly affect the group’s ability to advocate its public or\nprivate viewpoint. 530 U.S. at 648. The viewpoint at issue in\nDale was the Boy Scouts’ long-held belief that “homosexual\nconduct is inconsistent with . . . the Scout Oath” and that\n“homosexuals [do not] provide a role model consistent with\nthe[] expectations [of Scouting families].” Id. at 652.\nBecause the Boy Scouts’ expressive purpose was to “inculcate\n[youth] with the Boy Scouts’ values—both expressively and\nby example,” id. at 649–50, the organization believed that the\npresence of an openly gay assistant scoutmaster could be\nperceived as “promot[ing] homosexual conduct as a\nlegitimate form of behavior,” a message inconsistent with the\nexpression it wished to convey and the example it wished to\nset. Id. at 651.\n\n        The Supreme Court agreed. Because James Dale was\nopenly gay, his “presence in the Boy Scouts would, at the very\nleast, force the organization to send a message, both to youth\nmembers and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts\nhomosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.” Id. at\n\n                               25\n\f653.\n\n        Just as the Boy Scouts believed that “homosexual\nconduct is inconsistent with the Scout Oath,” id. at 652, the\nlaw schools believe that employment discrimination is\ninconsistent with their commitment to justice and fairness.\nJust as the Boy Scouts maintained that “homosexuals do not\nprovide a role model consistent with the expectations of\nScouting families,” id., the law schools maintain that military\nrecruiters engaging in exclusionary hiring “do not provide a\nrole model consistent with the expectations of,” id., their\nstudents and the legal community. Just as the Boy Scouts\nendeavored to “inculcate [youth] with the Boy Scouts’\nvalues—both expressively and by example,” id. at 649–50,\nthe law schools endeavor to “inculcate” their students with\ntheir chosen values by expression and example in the\npromulgation and enforcement of their nondiscrimination\npolicies. FAIR Br. at 22–25. And just as “Dale’s presence in\nthe Boy Scouts would, at the very least, force the organization\nto send a message, both to youth members and the world, that\nthe Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate\nform of behavior,” Dale, 530 U.S. at 653, the presence of\nmilitary recruiters “would, at the very least, force the law\nschools to send a message,” both to students and the legal\ncommunity, that the law schools “accept” employment\ndiscrimination “as a legitimate form of behavior.” Id.\n\n       Notwithstanding this compelling analogy, the District\n\n                              26\n\fCourt distinguished our case from Dale by suggesting there\nwas a critical difference between the forced inclusion of a gay\nassistant scoutmaster and the forced presence of an\n“unwanted periodic visitor,” the military recruiter, in the\ncontext of a larger recruiting effort. FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at\n304, 305. While there was “no question” that the gay\nscoutmaster would “undermine the Boy Scouts’ ability\nto . . . inculcate its values in younger members,” the District\nCourt wrote, the Solomon Amendment does not compel the\nlaw schools to accept the military recruiters as a “member”\nand does not “bestow upon them any semblance of authority.”\nId. at 305.\n\n        But our Court has recently held that compulsory\naccommodation of a government-prescribed message may\nviolate schools’ First Amendment expressive association\nrights, even when that message involves our most revered\naffirmations of American patriotism—the Pledge of\nAllegiance and our National Anthem, is only minimally\nintrusive and lacks the schools’ imprimatur. The Circle\nSchool, 381 F.3d at 182 (holding that a statute requiring\nprivate schools to lead the Pledge of Allegiance and National\nAnthem violates their rights under the expressive association\ndoctrine—“Certainly, the temporal duration of a burden on\nFirst Amendment rights is not determinative of whether there\nis a constitutional violation . . . . Similarly, the fact that the\nschools can issue a general disclaimer does not erase the First\nAmendment infringement at issue here, for the schools are\n\n                                27\n\fstill compelled to speak the [Government’s] message.”). If\nthe Pledge and Anthem “only take[] a very short period of\ntime each day,” and may be preceded by “a general disclaimer\nregarding the recitation,” yet do not “erase the First\nAmendment infringement at issue here,” id., then focusing on\nthe periodic nature of the military recruiter’s visits 11 is\nsimilarly unavailing.\n\n        Moreover, the District Court’s scrutiny of the law\nschools’ belief that the presence of military recruiters will\nundermine their expressive message about fairness and social\njustice violates the Dale Court’s instruction to “give\ndeference to an association’s view of what would impair its\nexpression.” 530 U.S. at 653.12 In Dale, the Court did more\n\n\n 11\n    Furthermore, the Solomon Amendment requires law schools\nto do more than passively accept the presence of an “unwanted\nperiodic visitor.” They must actively assist military recruiters in\na manner equal in quality and scope to the assistance they\nprovide other recruiters. 10 U.S.C. § 983(b)(1).\n      12\n      Dale may appear to depart from prior Supreme Court\njurisprudence in this area. In two expressive association cases\nfrom the 1980s, the Court considered the claims of civic\nassociations that state statutes forcing them to accept women as\nmembers violated their expressive association rights. Bd. of\nDirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537\n(1987); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984).\nCloser review explains the distinction from Dale. In both cases\n\n                                28\n\fthan pay lip service to deference notions. Deference\ndistinguished the Supreme Court’s conclusion on the\nimpairment question from that of the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt, which had decided the case previously. The state court\nhad ruled in Dale’s favor, holding that because the Boy\nScouts have a policy of “discourag[ing] its leaders from\ndisseminating any views on sexual issues,” Dale’s presence\n\n\n\nthe Court examined the organizations’ expressive charitable and\nhumanitarian purposes and determined that they would not be\nimpaired by the forced inclusion of women members. Duarte,\n481 U.S. at 548–49; Roberts, 468 U.S. at 626–27. The\ndifference in outcome between these cases and Dale—the civic\nassociations had to admit women, but the Boy Scouts did not\nhave to admit Dale—underscores the significance of the Court’s\ndecision to extend “deference to an association’s view of what\nwould impair its expression.” 530 U.S. at 653.\n       Moreover, we note that the Supreme Court had\npreviously extended deference to what an expressive association\nsaid would impair its expression. E.g., Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S.\n414, 424 (1988) (“The First Amendment protects appellees’\nright not only to advocate their cause but also to select what they\nbelieve to be the most effective means for so doing.”);\nDemocratic Party v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U.S. 107,\n123–24 (1981) (“[A] court[] may not constitutionally substitute\nits own judgment for that of the Party. A political party’s choice\namong the various ways of determining the makeup of a State’s\ndelegation to the party’s national convention is protected by the\nConstitution.”).\n\n                                29\n\fwould not significantly affect its ability to disseminate its\nmessage. 530 U.S. at 654 (citing Dale v. Boy Scouts of\nAmerica, 734 A.2d 1196, 1223 (N.J. 1999) (emphasis in\noriginal)). But faced with competing views— the Boy Scouts’\nview that Dale’s presence impaired their message and the\nstate court’s view that it could not— the Supreme Court\ndeferred to the Boy Scouts’ view. In other words, the reason\nwhy there was “no question” (in the District Court’s words in\nour case, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 305) that a gay scoutmaster\nwould undermine the Boy Scouts’ message was because the\nBoy Scouts said it would. Dale, 530 U.S. at 653. In our case,\nFAIR has supplied written evidence of its belief that the\nSolomon Amendment’s forcible inclusion of and assistance to\nmilitary recruiters undermines their efforts to disseminate\ntheir chosen message of nondiscrimination. Accordingly, we\nmust give Dale deference to this belief,13 and conclude that\n\n  13\n    Furthermore, the law schools are entitled to at least as much\ndeference as the Boy Scouts, as the Supreme Court has\nrecognized in other contexts that universities and law schools\n“occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition,” Grutter\nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 329 (2003), because of their “vital\nrole in . . . democracy,” Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S.\n234, 250 (1957). The Court has acknowledged the importance\nof “autonomous decisionmaking by the academy.” Regents of\nthe Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 226 n.12 (1985);\nSweezy, 354 U.S. at 263 (Frankfurter, J., concurring)\n(recognizing “four essential freedoms” of a university “to\ndetermine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what\n\n                               30\n\fFAIR likely satisfies the second element of an expressive\nassociation claim.\n\n             (c)    Balancing of interests\n\n       The third step in evaluating an expressive association\nclaim is “balancing the First Amendment interests implicated\nby the Solomon Amendment with competing societal interests\nto determine whether the statute transgresses constitutional\nboundaries.” FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 310.14 We need not\nlinger on this analysis. Rarely has government action been\ndeemed so integral to the advancement of a compelling\n\n\n\nmay be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted\nto study”).     The Supreme Court’s academic freedom\njurisprudence thus underscores the importance of Dale\ndeference in our case.\n   14\n      The District Court rejected FAIR’s argument that strict\nscrutiny applies because it did not believe that the Solomon\nAmendment directly burdens expressive association rights.\nFAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 310–311. But because we concluded\nat step two that the Solomon Amendment impairs law schools’\nexpression, strict scrutiny will apply. Dale, 530 U.S. at 659\n(rejecting the argument that only intermediate scrutiny should\napply); The Circle School, 381 F.3d at 182 (applying strict\nscrutiny to statute impairing schools’ expressive association\nrights by requiring them to lead the Pledge of Allegiance and\nNational Anthem).\n\n                             31\n\fpurpose as to justify the suppression or compulsion of speech.\nWe presume that the Government has a compelling interest in\nattracting talented military lawyers.15 But “[i]t is not enough\n\n\n  15\n    Our colleague in dissent states that “[w]e do not write on a\nclean slate regarding the importance Congress places in access\nto college and university facilities by the military” and that\n“[w]e have already decided that issue contrary to the argument\npressed by Appellants.”          In United States v. City of\nPhiladelphia, 798 F.2d 81 (3d Cir. 1986), our Court\nacknowledged that “Congress considers access to college and\nuniversity employment facilities by military recruiters to be a\nmatter of paramount importance.” Id. at 86. City of\nPhiladelphia, however, is distinguishable from this case in two\nimportant respects. First, in that case the university invited the\nmilitary recruiters on campus; the recruiters’ presence was not\neffectively dictated by a statute, as is the case here. Id. at 83.\nSecond, City of Philadelphia engaged in a conflict preemption\nanalysis and held that, because it was not possible for the\nuniversity to comply with both a Philadelphia anti-\ndiscrimination ordinance and the clear congressional policy\nconcerning military recruitment on campus, the ordinance was\npreempted. Id. at 88–89. Our Court did not reach a balancing-\nof-interests inquiry. Therefore, neither this Court’s prior\nacknowledgment of the importance Congress places on military\nrecruiting on college and university campuses, nor our\npresumption in this case that there is an important governmental\ninterest in attracting talented lawyers to the military, ends our\nanalysis. Rather, we must go on to reach an issue that was not\npresent in City of Philadelphia—whether the Solomon\n\n                               32\n\fto show that the Government’s ends are compelling; the\nmeans must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends.”\nSable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115,\n126 (1989).\n\n        As we explain in the final section of our opinion, infra\nPart III.B.3(b), the Solomon Amendment could barely be\ntailored more broadly. Unlike a typical employer, the military\nhas ample resources to recruit through alternative means. For\nexample, it may generate student interest by means of loan\nrepayment programs. And it may use sophisticated\nrecruitment devices that are generally too expensive for use\nby civilian recruiters, such as television and radio\nadvertisements. These methods do not require the assistance\nof law school space or personnel. And while they may be\nmore costly, the Government has given us no reason to\nsuspect that they are less effective than on-campus recruiting.\n\n       The availability of alternative, less speech-restrictive\nmeans of effective recruitment is sufficient to render the\nSolomon Amendment unconstitutional under strict scrutiny\nanalysis. Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; The Circle School, 381 F.3d\nat 182. But our path in this case is even clearer. The\nGovernment has failed to proffer a shred of evidence that the\n\n\nAmendment is narrowly tailored to achieve the Government’s\nends.\n\n\n                               33\n\fSolomon Amendment materially enhances its stated goal.\nAnd not only might other methods of recruitment yield\nacceptable results, they might actually fare better than the\ncurrent system. In fact, it may plausibly be the case that the\nSolomon Amendment, which has generated much ill will\ntoward the military on law school campuses,16 actually\nimpedes recruitment. 17\n\n\n  16\n    See, e.g., FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 282 (describing record\nevidence of student protests over military recruiting).\n   17\n     The dissent, applying the balancing-of-interests test from\nRoberts, 468 U.S. at 620, comes to the opposite\nconclusion—“that the law schools’ interests here fall at the\nremote extreme of Justice Brennan’s spectrum–‘where that\nrelationship’s objective characteristics locate it . . . [near] the\nmost attenuated of personal attachments.’” This balancing test,\nhowever, comes not from the portion of Roberts dealing with\nfreedom of expressive association, but from the portion dealing\nwith freedom of intimate association. The law schools are\nclearly not intimate associations, and where they may fall on the\nspectrum articulated by Justice Brennan for determining whether\nparticular relationships merit protection under that doctrine is\nirrelevant to our analysis here. In Roberts, the Court went on to\nengage in a strict scrutiny expressive association analysis and\napplied the balancing test we apply here, determining that the\nGovernment had a compelling interest in eliminating\ndiscrimination and that the statute at issue was the least\nrestrictive means of achieving that end. Roberts, 468 U.S. at\n620.\n\n                                34\n\f               *       *       *      *       *\n\n       FAIR likely satisfies the three elements of an\nexpressive association claim. The law schools are expressive\nassociations, they believe the message they choose to express\nis impaired by the Solomon Amendment, and no compelling\ngovernmental interest exists in the record to justify this\nimpairment. Therefore, FAIR has a reasonable likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of its expressive association claim\nagainst the Solomon Amendment.\n\n       2.     Compelled Speech\n\n        The Supreme Court has long recognized that, in\naddition to restricting suppression of speech, “the First\nAmendment may prevent the government from\n. . . compelling individuals to express certain views.” United\nStates v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 410 (2001) (citing,\ninter alia, W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624\n(1943)). “At the heart of the First Amendment lies the\nprinciple that each person should decide for himself or herself\nthe ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration,\nand adherence.” Turner Broad. Sys, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S.\n622, 641 (1994).\n\n       Consistent with this principle, the Supreme Court has\nfound impermissible compelled speech in three categories of\ngovernment action. The first is government action that forces\n\n                              35\n\fa private speaker to propagate a particular message chosen by\na government. See Barnette, 319 U.S. at 642 (state could not\nenforce compulsory flag salute statute); Wooley v. Maynard,\n430 U.S. 705, 717 (1977) (state could not require drivers to\ndisplay state motto on their license plates). The second is\ngovernment action that forces a private speaker to\naccommodate or include another private speaker’s message.\nSee Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, & Bisexual\nGroup of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 581 (1995) (state\nnondiscrimination statute could not be constitutionally applied\nto require parade organizers to include a contingent of gay\nmarchers behind their own banner); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.\nv. Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1, 12–16 (1986) (state\nregulatory commission could not require public utility to\ndistribute ratepayer-group’s message in the extra space of the\nutility’s billing statements); Miami Herald Publ’g Co. v.\nTornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 258 (1974) (state could not force\nnewspaper to provide equal editorial-page space to candidates\nit opposes). The third category is government action that\nforces an individual to subsidize or contribute to an\norganization that engages in speech that the individual\nopposes. See United Foods, 533 U.S. at 413 (Congress could\nnot require mushroom growers to pay assessments to fund\nadvertisements to promote mushroom sales); Abood v. Detroit\nBd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 235 (1977) (state could not\ncompel non-union employees to pay union dues to promote\n\n\n\n\n                              36\n\funion causes). 18 FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment\nforces law schools to propagate, accommodate, and subsidize\nthe military’s recruiting, and therefore implicates each of the\nthree varieties of compelled speech cases.\n\n        The District Court rejected FAIR’s argument and held\nthat the law schools are not compelled to express a particular\nideological message by admitting and actively assisting the\nmilitary recruiters. We disagree. As we explain in the\nanalysis that follows, the military’s recruiting is expressive of\na message with which the law schools disagree. To comply\nwith the Solomon Amendment, the law schools must\naffirmatively assist military recruiters in the same manner\nthey assist other recruiters, which means they must propagate,\naccommodate, and subsidize the military’s message. In so\ndoing, the Solomon Amendment conditions funding on a\nbasis that violates the law schools’ First Amendment rights\nunder the compelled speech doctrine.\n\n              (a)    Recruiting is expression.\n\n       The expressive nature of recruiting is evident by the\noral and written communication that recruiting entails:\npublished and posted announcements of the recruiter’s visit,\n\n\n 18\n    We note that the subsidization line of compelled speech case\nlaw is the only one of these three categories addressed by the\ndissent.\n\n                               37\n\fpublished and oral descriptions of the employer and the jobs it\nis trying to fill, 19 and the oral communication of an\nemployer’s recruiting reception and one-on-one interviews.\nThe expressive nature of recruiting is also evident in its\npurpose—to convince prospective employees that an\nemployer is worth working for. So understood, recruiting\nnecessarily involves “communication of information, the\ndissemination and propagation of views and ideas, and the\nadvocacy of causes”—the hallmarks of First Amendment\nexpression. Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better\nEnv’t, 444 U.S. 620, 632 (1980) (soliciting for charitable\ncause is expression entitled to First Amendment protection);\nsee also Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 538 (1945)\n(recognizing First Amendment protection for the solicitation\nof union members).\n\n        The District Court held that recruiting is not expressive\nactivity because it “differs dramatically” from other forms of\nexpressive activity, such as soliciting contributions and\n\n\n  19\n    For example, most recruiters submit a National Association\nfor Law Placement (“NALP”) form that, as NALP puts it,\n“offers employers a thorough yet succinct way to tell their story\nto candidates” and includes a “narrative” section to “discuss the\nspecial characteristics” of the employer. NALP compiles these\nforms into a directory, which is distributed and/or made\navailable by both law schools and employers to prospective\nemployees.\n\n                               38\n\fproselytizing. While soliciting and proselytizing cannot be\nseparated from the “concomitant advocacy of a particular case\nor viewpoint,” the District Court reasoned, recruiting does not\nadvocate any particular cause but only has “an economic or\nfunctional motive.” FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 307–08.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that soliciting and\nproselytizing are obvious forms of expressive activity. We\npart, however, on the notion that efforts to raise a legal staff\nare “economic or functional” while efforts to raise funds and\nmembership are not. Recruiting, soliciting and proselytizing\nare similarly economic and functional and, at the same time,\nsimilarly expressive. Recruiting conveys the message that\n“our organization is worth working for,” while soliciting and\nproselytizing convey the similar functional message that “our\ncharity is worth giving to” or “our cause is worth joining.”\n\n      Having determined that recruiting is expressive, we\nnow turn to the law schools’ disagreement with that\nexpression.\n\n              (b)    The law schools’ disagreement with the\n                     speech of military recruiters.\n\n       Military recruiters visiting law school campuses\nundoubtedly speak to students about the benefits of a career in\nthe military, and the Solomon Amendment requires law\nschools to accept this speech. The law schools do not seem to\n\n                               39\n\ftake issue with most of the “expressions of value, opinion, or\nendorsement,” Hurley, 515 U.S. at 573, made by military\nrecruiters on campus (to the extent recruiters suggest that\nmilitary careers are honorable and rewarding experiences).\nNor, for the most part, do military recruiters describing\ncareers in the military make “statements of fact the [law\nschools] would rather avoid.” Id.\n\n        The law schools’ lack of objection to most of the\nspeech they are forced to accept within their fora raises a key\nquestion under the compelled speech doctrine: to what extent\nmust they disagree with the Government’s message in order\nfor strict scrutiny to apply? Justice Souter’s dissent in\nGlickman v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457\n(1997), summarized the Court’s jurisprudence to that time in\nsuggesting that it is not necessary to show disagreement in\norder to sustain a compelled speech challenge.\n\n       [T]he requirement of disagreement finds no\n       legal warrant in our compelled-speech cases. In\n       Riley [v. Fed’n of the Blind of North Carolina,\n       Inc., 487 U.S. 781 (1988)], for example, we\n       held that the free-speech rights of charitable\n       solicitors were infringed by a law compelling\n       statements of fact with which the objectors\n       could not, and did not profess to, disagree. See\n       487 U.S., at 497-98, 108 S.Ct., at 2677-2678.\n       See also Hurley, 515 U.S., at 573, 115 S.Ct., at\n\n                              40\n\f2347 (“[The] general rule, that the speaker has\nthe right to tailor the speech, applies not only to\nexpressions of value, opinion, or endorsement,\nbut equally to statements of fact the speaker\nwould rather avoid . . . [.]”); Barnette, 319 U.S.,\nat 635, 63 S.Ct., at 1183-1184 (if the Free\nSpeech Clause bars the government from\nmaking the flag salute a legal duty,\nnonconformist beliefs are not required to\nexempt one from saluting). Indeed, the Abood\ncases themselves protect objecting employees\nfrom being forced to subsidize ideological\nunion activities unrelated to collective\nbargaining, without any requirement that the\nobjectors declare that they disagree with the\npositions espoused by the union. See, e.g.,\n[Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson, 475 U.S.\n292, 301-02 (1986)]; Abood, 431 U.S., at 234,\n97 S.Ct., at 1799. Requiring a profession of\ndisagreement is likewise at odds with our\nholding two Terms ago that no articulable\nmessage is necessary for expression to be\nprotected, Hurley, supra, at 569, 115 S.Ct., at\n2345; protection of speech is not limited to\nclear-cut propositions subject to assent or\ncontradiction, but covers a broader sphere of\nexpressive preference. . . . One need not\n“disagree” with an abstractionist when buying a\n\n                        41\n\f       canvas from a representational painter; one\n       merely wishes to support a different act of\n       expression.\n\nGlickman, 521 U.S. at 488–89 (Souter, J., dissenting, joined\nby Rehnquist, C.J., Scalia, J., and Thomas, J.).\n\n         Despite the numerous precedents to the contrary\ndiscussed by Justice Souter, it is possible to read the Glickman\nmajority as implicitly endorsing a disagreement requirement\nin the compelled speech context. Glickman involved a First\nAmendment challenge to regulations requiring fruit growers,\nhandlers, and processors to finance generic advertising of\nCalifornia nectarines, plums, and peaches. Id. at 460. The\nmajority “presume[d]” that the fruit growers, handlers, and\nprocessors “agree[d] with the central message of the speech\nthat is generated by the generic [government] program [at\nissue],” and stated that “compelled speech case law” was\n“inapplicable” because the scheme at issue did not, inter alia,\n“require them to use their own property to convey an\nantagonistic ideological message,” or “force them to respond\nto a hostile message when they would prefer to remain silent,”\nid. at 470–71 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)\n(emphases added). However, because the degree of\ndisagreement that may be required is minimal and in any\nevent is present in this case, we need not determine whether\nsuch a requirement exists nor, if so, decipher its precise\nbounds.\n\n                              42\n\f        As our dissenting colleague recently explained, the\n“individual’s disagreement [in a compelled speech case] can\nbe minor, as ‘[t]he general rule is that the speaker and the\naudience, not the government, assess the value of the\ninformation presented.’” Cochran v. Veneman, 359 F.3d 263,\n275 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting United Foods, 533 U.S. at 411).\nIn Cochran, we held unconstitutional a law requiring dairy\nproducers to pay small assessments in support of “generic\nadvertising that promotes milk.” Id. Although the aggrieved\ndairy producers did not disapprove of the pro-milk message at\nissue, the ads featured milk “produced by methods they\nview[ed] as wasteful and harmful to the environment,” and\ndid not promote milk produced by their own favored methods.\nId. The ads, in effect, served to promote milk produced by\nefforts with which the plaintiff dairy producers disagreed.\n\n       Here the law schools similarly object to conveying the\nmessage that all employers are equal, and instead would\nrather only open their fora and use their resources to support\nemployers who, in their eyes, do not discriminate against\ngays. This objection constitutes as much of a protected First\nAmendment interest as the objection of the dairy farmers in\nCochran. Moreover, there is at least one important sense in\nwhich the law schools strenuously disagree with the very\nwords spoken by military recruiters that the Solomon\nAmendment compels them to accept and to which they have\nbeen forced to respond. 10 U.S.C. § 654(b) prohibits open,\npracticing gays from serving in the armed forces. Military\n\n                              43\n\frecruiters undisputedly are bound by § 654(b), and do not\nrecruit gay persons for service. Unsurprisingly, in light of\n§ 654(b), the record demonstrates that openly gay persons\nwho meet with military recruiters are told by the recruiters\nthat they may not pursue military careers.20 Such speech by\nmilitary recruiters is perhaps the most discordant speech the\nSolomon Amendment compels the law schools to accept.\nYet, as we have indicated, the act of being forced to accept\nspeech promoting an employer whose discriminatory policies\nthe law schools disagree with is sufficient “disagreement” to\nbring the Solomon Amendment within the Supreme Court’s\ncompelled speech jurisprudence.\n\n       Thus, unlike the regulatory scheme at issue in\nGlickman, the Solomon Amendment, by requiring law schools\nto open their fora to military recruiters when they would\nprefer to do so only for non-discriminating employers,\n“require[s] them to use their own property to convey an\nantagonistic ideological message.” Glickman, 521 U.S. at\n471. Likewise, by directly providing “access” to campuses\nfor speech by military recruiters where law students are told\nthat openly gay applicants may not serve, the Solomon\nAmendment requires the law schools to allow an\n\n\n 20\n    See JA107 (former ROTC student who had “wanted to be an\nofficer in the JAG Corps since high school” interviewed with\nmilitary recruiter, admitted his homosexuality, and was told that\nhe was “ineligible due to his sexual orientation”).\n\n                               44\n\fobjectionable message counter to their beliefs. In addition,\nboth forms of speech with which the law schools disagree\nhave resulted in, according to the record, hundreds (if not\nthousands) of instances of responsive speech by members of\nthe law school communities (administrators, faculty, and\nstudents), including various broadcast e-mails by law school\nadministrators to their communities, posters in protest of\nmilitary recruiter visits, and open fora held to “ameliorate” the\neffects of forced on-campus speech by military recruiters. All\nof these represent instances in which the schools were\n“force[d] . . . to respond to a hostile message when they\nwould prefer to remain silent.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Therefore, the degree of the law schools’\ndisagreement with the military recruiters’ expression is\nsufficient to warrant First Amendment protection. We now\ndetermine whether the Solomon Amendment compels the law\nschools to engage in that expression.\n\n              (c)    The law schools must propagate,\n                     accommodate, and subsidize the\n                     military’s expressive message.\n\n       Reasoning that the Solomon Amendment was not “an\noutright regulation on speech,” the District Court held that the\nSupreme Court’s compelled speech doctrine did not apply.\nFAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 309. Put another way, the District\nCourt concluded that the statute does not “directly requir[e] a\nprivate speaker to participate in the dissemination of a\n\n                               45\n\fparticular message.” Id.\n\n       We disagree. Having concluded above that recruiting\nis expression, we believe that the Solomon Amendment\ncompels the law schools to engage in that expression in all\nthree proscribed ways: propagation, accommodation, and\nsubsidy. The statute insists not only on access to campus for\nmilitary recruiters, but the active and equal assistance of law\nschools’ career services offices. For example, Harvard Law\nSchool’s career services staff offers to assist employers to\n“get [their] message out to students in an effective manner.”\nLike many law schools, the assistance Harvard provides\nincludes coordinating interviews with students, counseling\nemployers on effective recruiting, stuffing students’\nmailboxes with employers’ information, scheduling social\nreceptions for students, and printing employers’\nannouncements in the School’s newsletter. Under the express\nterms of the Solomon Amendment, law schools like Harvard\nmust do the same for the military recruiters.\n\n        By requiring law schools to help military recruiters\n“get [their] message out to students” by distributing\nnewsletters and posting notices, the Solomon Amendment\ncompels law schools to propagate the military’s message.\nLike the forced display of an unwanted motto on one’s license\nplate, or the compulsory recitation of a pledge, this is\ncompelled speech. Wooley, 430 U.S. at 717; Barnette, 319\nU.S. at 642. By requiring schools to include military\n\n                              46\n\frecruiters in the interviews and recruiting receptions the\nschools arrange, the Solomon Amendment compels the\nschools to accommodate the military’s message in the\nrecruiting-assistance programs they provide for other\nemployers. Like the forced inclusion of a parade contingent,\na statement in the extra space of a utility’s billing statement,\nor a response in a newspaper’s editorial page, this is\ncompelled speech. See Hurley, 515 U.S. at 569–81; Pacific\nGas, 475 U.S. at 12–16; Miami Herald, 418 U.S. at 255–58.\nAnd by putting demands on the law schools’ employees and\nresources,21 the schools are compelled to subsidize the\nmilitary’s recruiting message. Like mandatory assessments to\nsupport advertisements or political funds, this is compelled\nspeech. See United Foods, 533 U.S. at 411–17; Abood, 431\nU.S. at 235.\n\n              (d)    The Solomon Amendment prohibits\n                     disclaimers and, even if it did not, risk of\n                     misattribution is not an element of a\n                     compelled speech violation.\n\n\n  21\n    While we recognize that the relative cost of providing these\nservices to one particular employer is marginal, the Supreme\nCourt has never required that compelled subsidies be substantial\nto present a constitutional concern. See, e.g., United Foods, 533\nU.S. at 408 (mushroom assessment at issue was one cent per\npound and only some of it was going toward the objectionable\nadvertising).\n\n                               47\n\f       The District Court suggested that assisting military\nrecruiters is not “obvious endorsement” by the law schools of\nthe military’s point of view because “law schools can\neffectively disclaim any recruiting message and can easily\ndistance themselves ideologically from the military\nrecruiters.” FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 308, 310. But the\nSolomon Amendment, as recently amended, does not appear\nto permit law schools to disclaim the military’s message. Its\nexpress terms require them to provide treatment to the\nmilitary recruiters “equal in quality and scope” to that\nprovided to other employers. As the law schools do not\ndisclaim the messages of those employers, similarly they may\nnot disclaim the message of the military. Furthermore, it was\nin apparent response to the law schools’ ameliorative\nmeasures—their efforts to “distance themselves” (in the\nDistrict Court’s words) from the military’s position—that the\nDOD and eventually Congress insisted on equal treatment for\nmilitary recruiters.\n\n       But even if the Solomon Amendment allowed for\ndisclaimers, the Supreme Court has never held that compelled\nspeech concerns evaporate if a speaker can ameliorate the risk\nof misattribution by disclaiming the message it is being\ncompelled to propagate. To the contrary, “the presence of a\ndisclaimer . . . does not suffice to eliminate the impermissible\npressure . . . to respond to [compelled] speech.” Pacific Gas,\n475 U.S. at 15 n.11 (plurality opinion). While a disclaimer\nreduces the risk that readers will misattribute the message, it\n\n                               48\n\f“does nothing to reduce the risk that [the compelled speaker]\nwill be forced to respond when there is strong disagreement\nwith the substance of [the] message.” Id. Thus, in Pacific\nGas, the Supreme Court invalidated as compelled speech a\nrequirement that a utility share the extra space in its billing\nstatements with an organization that opposed its viewpoint.\nThe utility’s ability to include a disclaimer did not change the\nanalysis. In fact, a “forced reply” may add to the injury of\ncompelled speech, not its cure. Id. at 15–16 (noting that the\n“pressure to respond” to compelled speech is “antithetical to\nthe free discussion that the First Amendment seeks to foster”).\n\n        In Miami Herald, the Supreme Court also invalidated a\nstate law compelling newspapers to provide editorial page\nspace to any political candidates that the newspaper assailed\nin an editorial. 418 U.S. at 255–58. It did not suggest that a\nnewspaper could alleviate compelled speech by running a\ndisclaimer above the candidate’s message.22\n\n\n  22\n    While the newspapers could avoid triggering the penalty of\nhaving to provide editorial page space to assailed candidates by\nnot criticizing any candidates at all, the Court noted that this\nself-censorship was a form of speech suppression, itself a First\nAmendment injury. 418 U.S. at 257. Our case presents this\nself-censorship concern as well, as the law schools could avoid\ntriggering—or at least minimize—the quality and scope of\nactive assistance they must provide to military recruiters by\nlimiting the quality and scope of their assistance to other\n\n                              49\n\f       Similarly, in Wooley the Court held that the state motto\non the Maynards’ license plate was compelled speech even\nthough the state supreme court had expressly found in another\ncase that “nothing in the state law . . . precludes appellees\nfrom displaying their disagreement with the state motto as\nlong as the methods used do not obscure the license plates.”\n430 U.S. at 722 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (citing State v.\nHoskin, 295 A.2d 454 (1972)). 23 On the facts of Wooley,\n\n\nrecruiters.\n      23\n        The Supreme Court has expressed concerns about\nmisattribution and ability to disclaim in several of its compelled\nspeech cases. See Hurley, 515 U.S. at 556–57 (noting that\nparade organizers do not customarily “disavow ‘any identity of\nviewpoint’ between themselves and the selected participants”\nand that “such disclaimers would be quite curious in a moving\nparade”); Turner Broadcast System v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622 (1994)\n(“TBS”) (noting that regulations requiring cable operators to\ncarry broadcast signals posed little risk of misattribution because\nbroadcasters are required by federal regulation to identify\nthemselves at least once every hour); PruneYard Shopping\nCenter v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 87 (1984) (suggesting that there\nwas no risk that the message of students distributing political\npamphlets and conducting a petition drive at a shopping mall\nwould be attributed incorrectly to the mall owner and noting that\nthe mall owner could disavow any connection with the message\nby posting signs near the petition table).\n       But in none of these cases did the Court hold that the risk\nof misattribution and the speaker’s ability to disclaim the\n\n                                50\n\fthere was virtually no risk that the compelled speech would be\nattributed to anyone other than the state.\n\n\n\n\nmessage were dispositive elements of the compelled speech\ndoctrine. In Hurley, the Court noted that it was not “deciding on\nthe precise significance of the likelihood of misattribution” and\ndid not rest its holding on the parade organizer’s presumed\ndifficulty in disclaiming the gay marchers’ message. 515 U.S.\nat 517. And in both PruneYard and TBS the absence of a risk of\nmisattribution was only one of a number of factors\ndistinguishing them from prior cases in which compelled speech\nhad been found. PruneYard, 447 U.S. at 87; TBS, 512 U.S. at\n654–55. The Court also considered the content-neutral nature\nof the law causing the challenged “compelled” speech, the\nnonexistent risk of self-censorship, and the unique\ncharacteristics of the forum (the Court later described the\nshopping mall in PruneYard as a “peculiarly public” forum, see\nPacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 13 n.8; the TBS Court noted cable’s\nmonopoly status and exclusive control over the “essential\npathway” for disseminating a particular type of communication).\nTBS, 512 U.S. at 654–56; PruneYard, 447 U.S. at 87–88. And\nwhile PruneYard comes closest to holding that a speaker’s\nability to disclaim a message may be relevant to the compelled\nspeech analysis, it is notable that PruneYard predated Pacific\nGas, the most express rejection of the ability to disclaim as an\nantidote for compelled speech. Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 15 n.11\n(plurality opinion) (“The presence of a disclaimer . . . does not\nsuffice to eliminate the impermissible pressure on the appellant\nto respond to [the unwanted] speech . . . .”).\n\n                               51\n\f        In sum, law schools are expressly precluded from\ndisclaiming or retorting the military’s recruiting message by\nthe Solomon Amendment’s new requirement that their\ntreatment of military recruiters be “equal in quality and\nscope” to the treatment of other recruiters. And while the\nCourt has mentioned the danger of misattribution and the\nspeaker’s ability to disclaim in several of its compelled speech\ncases, it has not held to date that the presence of either factor\neliminated compelled speech concerns. Therefore, the\nDistrict Court was wrong to reject FAIR’s compelled speech\nclaims on the basis of its conclusion that the Solomon\nAmendment’s requirements posed little risk of misattribution\nto the law schools who in any event could effectively disclaim\nthe military’s message.\n\n              (e)     The Solomon Amendment would not\n                      likely survive strict scrutiny.\n\n        Although the Solomon Amendment impairs the law\nschools’ First Amendment rights by compelling them to\npropagate, accommodate, and subsidize the military’s\nrecruiting message against their will, the statute “could still be\nvalid if it were a narrowly tailored means of serving a\ncompelling state interest”—i.e., if it passed strict First\nAmendment scrutiny. Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 19; see also\nRiley, 487 U.S. at 798 (regulation impairing speakers’ First\nAmendment rights under the compelled speech doctrine was\nsubject to “exacting First Amendment scrutiny” that it did not\n\n                               52\n\fsurvive). We thus inquire (1) whether the Government’s\ninterest in recruiting military lawyers is compelling, and (2)\nwhether the Solomon Amendment is narrowly tailored to\nadvance that goal. But as discussed above in the context of\nFAIR’s expressive association claim, see supra Part\nIII.B.1(c), the Solomon Amendment does not survive strict\nscrutiny because the Government has not demonstrated (or\neven argued) that it cannot recruit effectively by less speech-\nrestrictive means. Therefore, the balance of interests likely\ntips in the law schools’ favor.\n\n                *      *       *       *       *\n\n       To summarize, the Solomon Amendment conditions\nfunding on the law schools’ propagation, accommodation, and\nsubsidy of the military’s recruiting, which is expression. The\nGovernment has not shown that the assistance from law\nschools that the Solomon Amendment requires is narrowly\ntailored to advance its interest in recruiting. FAIR has thus\nestablished a reasonable likelihood of establishing that the\nSolomon Amendment unconstitutionally conditions funding\non a basis that infringes law schools’ constitutionally\nprotected interests under the First Amendment doctrine of\ncompelled speech.\n\n       3.     Consideration of O’Brien\n\n       We turn finally to an argument that is ancillary to our\n\n                               53\n\fholding. Although the Solomon Amendment fits within the\ncategories of First Amendment cases described in the\nprevious sections, the District Court placed it instead into a\nmold it does not fit: the doctrine of expressive conduct. In so\ndoing, it applied the intermediate scrutiny test set out by the\nSupreme Court in United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367\n(1968), discussed at length below, for review of governmental\nregulations with only an incidental effect on expression. For\nthe sake of completeness, we close by considering whether\nthe law schools’ resistance to the military’s recruitment\npolicy, motivated by their ideological opposition to exclusion\nbased on sexual orientation, is expressive conduct protected\nby the First Amendment. 24\n\n              (a)    O’Brien is inapplicable when First\n\n\n  24\n    While the expressive content of the law schools’ message is\nrelevant also to the law schools’ expressive association claim\nunder Dale, the analysis is different in that context. Under the\nrubric of expressive association, we consider whether the\nSolomon Amendment interferes with the law schools’ extant\nmessage of nondiscrimination, and thus impinges their\nassociational freedom, by compelling them to assist in the\nmilitary’s recruitment efforts. But with expressive conduct we\nask whether resistance to the statute, i.e., exclusion of the\nrecruiters in contravention of the statute (or its flip side, “the\nconduct of law schools in permitting or assisting a recruiting\nactivity,” FAIR, 291 F. Supp. 2d at 309), is itself expressive\nconduct warranting First Amendment protection.\n\n                               54\n\f                     Amendment activity is protected on other\n                     grounds.\n\n        Before exploring the contours of the O’Brien test, we\nexplain briefly why expressive conduct fails as a descriptive\nmodel of the First Amendment issues at stake in this case.\nActivity simultaneously may give rise to an expressive\nconduct claim and to claims based on alternative theories.\nThe premise of the category “expressive conduct” is that some\nactivity, though it is not speech proper and is not protected\nunder other First Amendment grounds, is crucial to public\ndebate and warrants protection. See Texas v. Johnson, 491\nU.S. 397, 404 (1989) (explaining that the Court has “long\nrecognized that [the First Amendment’s] protection does not\nend at the spoken or written word” and that conduct may be\n“sufficiently imbued with elements of communication” to\nmerit First Amendment protection) (citations omitted).\nExpressive conduct is, loosely stated, an overflow category; it\nis broad.25 It is therefore unsurprising that much expression\n\n\n  25\n    As noted in Johnson, id., the Supreme Court has recognized\nthe expressive nature of students' wearing of black armbands to\nprotest the war in Vietnam, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent\nCommunity School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505 (1969); of a sit-in\nby black citizens in a segregated area, Brown v. Louisiana, 383\nU.S. 131, 141-142 (1966); of the wearing of American military\nuniforms in a dramatic presentation criticizing American\ninvolvement in Vietnam, Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58\n\n                              55\n\fthat falls squarely within the doctrines discussed in the first\nsections may also be cast as expressive conduct. In those\ncases, application of the O’Brien test is inappropriate.\n\n        We need only look at the seminal expressive\nassociation and compelled speech cases to see that this is so.\nIn Dale, for example, the Supreme Court expressly declined\nto rely on O’Brien, explaining: “New Jersey’s public\naccommodations law directly and immediately affects\nassociational rights, in this case associational rights that enjoy\nFirst Amendment protection. Thus, O’Brien is inapplicable.”\n530 U.S. at 659. Likewise in Wooley v. Maynard, the\nSupreme Court elected not to consider O’Brien because it\nconsidered compelled speech to be a “more appropriate First\nAmendment ground[].” 430 U.S. at 713. In short, the Court\nhas not applied O’Brien where alternative First Amendment\ngrounds were available.\n\n       Taking our cue from the Supreme Court, because the\nSolomon Amendment is subject to strict scrutiny under the\ndoctrines of expressive association and compelled speech, we\nneed not engage in an O’Brien analysis. Because O’Brien\nscrutiny is intermediate rather than strict, demonstrating a\nconstitutional violation under a theory of expressive conduct\n\n\n(1970); and of picketing in support of a wide variety of causes,\nsee, e.g., Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S.\n308, 313-314 (1968).\n\n                                56\n\fis significantly more burdensome than under the models we\nhave discussed. And the law schools need establish only one\nconstitutional infirmity to justify an injunction. See, e.g., Sys.\nOperations, Inc. v. Scientific Games Dev. Corp., 555 F.2d\n1131, 1144 (3d Cir. 1977).\n\n              (b)     Even under O’Brien, the Solomon\n                      Amendment is likely to impair expressive\n                      conduct unconstitutionally.\n\n        Even if O’Brien applied, we would reverse the District\nCourt’s decision because we disagree with its application of\nintermediate scrutiny. Notwithstanding that the District\nCourt’s opinion featured a consistent theme—that the\nSolomon Amendment “targets conduct, not speech”—the\nCourt acknowledged a communicative or expressive element\nin the law schools’ policies against offering the schools’\nresources, support, or endorsement to any employer who does\nnot conform to their antidiscrimination policies. FAIR, 291\nF. Supp. 2d at 311. Thus, to the extent we focus on the law\nschools’ conduct, it is nonetheless expressive.\n\n        The First Amendment protects the right to engage in\nexpressive conduct. See, e.g., NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware\nCo., 458 U.S. 886, 907 (1982) (recognizing the right of\nboycotters to “band[] together and collectively express[] their\ndissatisfaction with a social structure that had denied them\nrights to equal treatment and respect”); Spence v. Washington,\n\n                                57\n\f418 U.S. 405, 411 (1974) (acknowledging First Amendment\nprotection for conduct that “convey[s] a particularized\nmessage” that is understood as expression in the context of\nsurrounding circumstances). A government regulation\nimpairing expressive conduct is only justified “[1] if it is\nwithin the constitutional power of the Government; [2] if it\nfurthers an important or substantial governmental interest; [3]\nif the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of\nfree expression; and [4] if the incidental restriction on alleged\nFirst Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to\nthe furtherance of that interest.” O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 377.\n\n        We take no issue with the District Court’s conclusion\nthat the Solomon Amendment is within the constitutional\npower of the Government, as the Constitution authorizes\nCongress to raise and support a military. FAIR, 291 F. Supp.\n2d at 312 (citing U.S. Const. art. 1 § 8). We assume arguendo\nthat the District Court was correct in determining that the\nSolomon Amendment is unrelated to the suppression of ideas.\nId. at 314. And we of course presume that the United States\nhas a vital interest in having a system for acquiring talented\nmilitary lawyers. But as we noted above, the Government\nhas chosen to submit no evidence that would support the\nnecessity of requiring law schools to provide the military with\na forum for, and assistance in, recruiting. Instead, the\nGovernment argues that “the impact of the wholesale\nexclusion of military recruiters [from law school campuses] is\nself-evident, and the government is not obligated” during\n\n                               58\n\fpreliminary injunction proceedings “to assemble and present a\nfactual record that merely confirms the dictates of common\nsense.” The Government fails to offer even an affidavit\nindicating that enforcement of the Solomon Amendment has\nenhanced military recruiting efforts. It suggests simply that\nthe scope of the remedy sought by the plaintiffs relieves the\nGovernment of its obligation, pursuant to the First\nAmendment, to justify its curtailment of expression. How this\nis so we cannot conjure. We are unaware of any case so\nholding.26 And while the Government emphasizes that the\nNation’s military is at stake, invoking the importance of a\nwell-trained military is not a substitute for demonstrating that\nthere is an important governmental interest in opening the law\nschools to military recruiting. See Rostker v. Goldberg, 453\nU.S. 57, 89 (1981) (“‘[T]he phrase “war power” cannot be\ninvoked as a talismanic incantation to . . . remove\nconstitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties.’”\n(quoting United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 263-64\n\n\n\n\n   26\n     The Government quotes Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Gov’t\nPAC, 528 U.S. 377, 378 (2000), for the proposition that “[t]he\nquantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened\njudicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down\nwith the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised.” But\nthis is not a case where the Government has presented less\nevidence than might otherwise be required; here the\nGovernment has presented no evidence.\n\n                                59\n\f(1967))). 27\n\n        It may be the case, as the Government argues, that on-\ncampus recruitment is an employer’s principal tool for\nattracting talented students. But it does not thereby follow\nthat recruiting by means of the Solomon Amendment is\neffective. On the contrary, it seems to us equally plausible\nthat the Solomon Amendment has in fact hampered\nrecruitment by subjecting the military’s exclusionary policy to\npublic scrutiny. The record is replete with references to\nstudent protests and public condemnation. In this context, it\nis hardly “common sense,” as the military alleges, that its\npresence on campus amidst such commotion and opposition\nhas aided its recruitment efforts.\n\n        In closing, we emphasize again that we need not enter\nthe thicket of O’Brien analysis in this case. We rely on the\ndoctrines of expressive association and compelled speech to\nconclude that FAIR has made the requisite showing of a\nlikelihood of success on the merits in support of its motion for\n\n\n  27\n    We note that this is not a case involving military discretion\nto determine whether internal policies are necessary and\nappropriate. Cf. Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 743 (1974)\n(“[T]he military is, by necessity, a specialized society separate\nfrom civilian society” (citation omitted)). On the contrary, this\ncase involves the military’s compelled presence on the campuses\nof civilian institutions.\n\n                               60\n\fa preliminary injunction. And even under the intermediate\nscrutiny test of O’Brien the Solomon Amendment falters thus\nfar, for the Government has chosen not to produce any\nevidence that it is no more than necessary to further the\nGovernment’s interest. Perhaps this explains why the DOD\ninitially objected to the Amendment as “unnecessary” and\n“duplicative.” 140 Cong. Rec. H3864 (daily ed. May 23,\n1994).\n\nC.     Other preliminary injunction factors\n\n        By establishing a likelihood of success on the merits of\nits unconstitutional condition claim based on a First\nAmendment violation, FAIR has necessarily satisfied the\nsecond element: irreparable harm. Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.\n347, 373 (1976) (“The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for\neven minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.”); see also Beal v. Stern, 184 F.3d 117, 123\n(2d Cir. 1999) (“[T]he irreparable injury issue and the\nlikelihood of success issue overlap almost entirely” in the\nFirst Amendment context). On the third element, we\nconclude that the balance of interest tips in FAIR’s favor.\nWithout an injunction, the law schools’ First Amendment\nrights under the expressive association doctrine and the\ncompelled speech doctrine will be impaired during on-campus\nrecruiting seasons. The Government, on the other hand, does\nnot lose the opportunity, in a proceeding on the merits, to\n“shoulder its full constitutional burden of proof” of showing\n\n                              61\n\fthat a less restrictive alternative would not be as effective.\nAshcroft v. ACLU, 124 S. Ct. 2783, 2794 (2004). As for the\nfinal element, we believe the public is best served by\nenjoining a statute that unconstitutionally impairs First\nAmendment rights.\n\n                       IV.   Conclusion\n\n        The Solomon Amendment requires law schools to\nexpress a message that is incompatible with their educational\nobjectives, and no compelling governmental interest has been\nshown to deny this freedom. While no doubt military lawyers\nare critical to the efficient operation of the armed forces, mere\nincantation of the need for legal talent cannot override a clear\nFirst Amendment impairment. Even were the test less\nrigorous than a compelling governmental riposte to the\nschools’ rights under the First Amendment, failure\nnonetheless is foreordained at this stage, for the military fails\nto provide any evidence that its restrictions on speech are no\nmore than required to further its interest in attracting good\nlegal counsel.\n\n        In this context, the Solomon Amendment cannot\ncondition federal funding on law schools’ compliance with it.\nFAIR has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits and\nsatisfies the other injunctive elements as well. We reverse\nand remand for the District Court to enter a preliminary\ninjunction against enforcement of the Solomon Amendment.\n\n                               62\n\fFAIR et al. v. Rumsfeld et al., No. 03-4433\n\nALDISERT, Circuit Judge, Dissenting.\n\n\n\n\n       I would affirm the judgment of the district court.\nAlthough I have myriad problems with the fundamental\ncontentions presented by the Appellants and the host of\nsupporting amicus curiae briefs, essentially my disagreement\nis with the all-pervasive approach that this is a case of First\nAmendment protection in the nude. It is not.\n\n       Rather, the issues before us are threefold. First, we\nmust inquire whether Appellants have met the high burden of\novercoming the presumption of constitutionality of a\ncongressional statute that is not only bottomed on the\nSpending Clause, but on a number of other specific provisions\nin the Constitution that deal with Congress’ obligation to\nsupport the military. This is especially relevant because, in the\nentire history of the United States, no court heretofore has\never declared unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds\nany congressional statute specifically designed to support the\nmilitary.\n\n       Second, we must determine, using canons of logic,\n\n                               63\n\fwhether a permissible factual inference—let alone a\ncompellable one—may be properly drawn that the law\nschools’ anti-discrimination policies are violated from the\nsole evidentiary datum that a military recruiter appears on\ncampus for a short time.\n\n        Third, only if a proper inference may be drawn do we\nmeet First Amendment considerations. The First Amendment\nis implicated if and only if, after applying the “balance-of-\ninterests” test originally articulated by Justice Brennan in\nRoberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984), it can\nbe concluded that the operation of the First Amendment\ntrumps the several clauses of Articles I and II relating to the\nspending power and support of the military.\n\n       Upon analysis, the argument of the Appellants and\nmany of the amici curiae, including but not limited to the\nAssociation of American Law Schools, is rather complex. Its\npoint of beginning takes the following tripartite form: (1)\nmost, but not all, accredited American law schools have\nadopted policies that indicate they will not discriminate based\non age, race, color, national origin, disability, religion, gender\nor sexual orientation; (2) the law schools have committed\nthemselves to “admit students, grant scholarships, grade\nexams, recruit and promote faculty, and hire staff in light of\nthese principles” (J.A. at 509); (3) in conjunction with their\nown commitment not to discriminate, the law schools have\nadopted policies stating that they will not assist employers\n\n                                64\n\fwho discriminate.\n\n       Their intermediate statement is that the United States\nmilitary excludes service members based on evidence of\nhomosexual conduct or orientation. See 10 U.S.C. § 654\n(2004). From this, the law schools conclude that permitting\nthe military to recruit on campus for military lawyers and\nmilitary judges creates a compellable inference that the law\nschools are violating their own policies prohibiting\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\n        They then move to the Solomon Amendment which\nprovides that certain federal grants will not be made to “an\ninstitution of higher education ... if the Secretary of Defense\ndetermines that that institution ... has a policy or practice ..\nthat either prohibits, or in effect prevents – (1) the Secretary\nof a military department or [the Department of Homeland\nSecurity] from gaining entry to campuses, or access to\nstudents (who are 17 years of age or older) on campuses, for\npurposes of military recruiting . . .” 28 10 U.S.C. § 983.\n\n\n  28\n    Congress has clarified that the funding restriction does not\napply to the following: (1) federal grants of funds “to be\navailable solely for student financial assistance or related\nadministrative costs,” Pub. L. No. 106-79, § 8120, 113 Stat.\n1260 (Oct. 25, 1999); (2) an institution that ceased its prior\npolicy or practice of prohibiting or effectively preventing entry\nto campus or access to students on campus for military\n\n                               65\n\f        This year, Congress amended the Solomon\nAmendment to require military recruiting access “in a manner\nthat is at least equal in quality and scope to the [degree of]\naccess to campuses and to students that is provided to any\nother employer.” National Defense Authorization Bill for\nFiscal Year 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-287 (2004).\n\n        From the foregoing premises Appellants’ Second\nAmended Complaint alleges that the Solomon Amendment\nand regulations promulgated thereunder violate the First\nAmendment as applied to law schools by: (1) imposing\nunconstitutional conditions on the receipt of federal funding;\n(2) effecting viewpoint discrimination; (3) forcing the\nplaintiffs to endorse messages repugnant to them and\nsuppressing their expression of dissent; and (4) imposing\nvague and overbroad restrictions on speech.\n\n       I would hold that Congress’ use of the spending power\nand fulfillment of the requirements to maintain the military\nunder Articles I and II do not unreasonably burden speech\nand, therefore, do not offend the First Amendment. I apply the\nbalance-of-interests test and decide that the interest of\nprotecting the national security of the United States outweighs\n\n\nrecruiting, 10 U.S.C. § 983(c)(1); and (3) an institution that “has\na longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical religious\naffiliation,” 10 U.S.C. § 983(c)(2).\n\n\n                                66\n\fthe indirect and attenuated interest in the law schools’ speech,\nexpressive association and academic freedom rights. The\nSolomon Amendment survives the constitutional attack\nbecause its provisions, the 2004 amendments thereto and\nrelated regulations, govern conduct while only incidentally\naffecting speech. In serving its compelling interest in\nrecruiting military lawyers, the statute does not require the\ngovernment to engage in unconstitutional conduct.\nAccordingly, with respect, I dissent. I agree with the\nthoughtful statement of reasons of the district court and would\naffirm its judgment.\n\n                               I.\n\n       The starting point for analysis must be fealty to the\nprecept that congressional statutes are presumed to be\nconstitutional. See, e.g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida\nGulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568,\n575 (1988) (“‘[t]he elementary rule is that every reasonable\nconstruction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute\nfrom unconstitutionality.’”) (quoting Hooper v. California,\n155 U.S. 648, 657 (1895)); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of\nChicago, 440 U.S. 490, 500 (1979) ( “[A]n act of Congress\nought not be construed to violate the Constitution if any other\npossible construction remains available.”). Thus in Rust v.\nSullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), the Court teaches:\n\n       The principle enunciated in Hooper v. California, supra\n\n                              67\n\f       and subsequent cases, is a categorical one: As between\n       two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of\n       which it would be unconstitutional and by the other\n       valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which would save\n       the Act. Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927)\n       (opinion of Holmes, J.). This principle is based at least\n       in part on the fact that a decision to declare an Act of\n       Congress unconstitutional “is the gravest and most\n       delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.”\n       Ibid. Following Hooper, supra, cases such as United\n       States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson\n       Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909), and United States v. Jin\n       Fuey and Moy, 241 U.S. 394, 401 (1916), developed\n       the corollary doctrine that “[a] statute must be\n       construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the\n       conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave\n       doubts upon that score.” This canon is followed out of\n       respect for Congress, which we assume legislates in\n       the light of constitutional limitations. FTC v. American\n       Tobacco Co., 260 U.S. 298, 305-307 (1924). It is\n       qualified by the proposition that “avoidance of a\n       difficulty will not be pressed to the point of\n       disingenuous evasion.” George Moore Ice Cream Co.\n       v. Rose, 298 U.S. 373, 379 (1933).\n\n\n\n\nId. at 190-191.\n\n                               68\n\f        It is noted that although the Supreme Court considers\nthis principle “a categorical one,” it is not included in the\nmajority’s analysis.\n\n                              II.\n\n        A second disagreement with the approach of my\ndistinguished brothers of the majority is that they have not\nidentified by name or discussed the several important\nprovisions of the Constitution that provide for the support of\nthe military and that antedate the promulgation of the\namendments contained in the Bill of Rights.\n\n        Among the powers granted to Congress is the\nspending power: “The Congress shall have Power To lay and\ncollect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts\nand provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of\nthe United States. . .” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.\nFurthermore, Congress is specifically given several powers\nrelated to the military: (1) “[t]o declare War, grant Letters of\nMarque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures\non Land and Water,” id. cl. 11; (2) “[t]o raise and support\nArmies, but no appropriation of Money to that Use shall be\nfor a longer Term than two Years,” id. cl. 12; (3) “[t]o provide\nand maintain a Navy,” id. cl. 13; and (4) “[t]o make Rules for\nthe Government and Regulation of the land and naval\nForces,” id. cl. 14.\n\n\n\n                              69\n\f       The Constitution also authorizes Congress “[t]o make\nall Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into\nExecution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested\nby this Constitution in the Government of the United States,\nor in any Department or Officer thereof.” Id. cl. 18.\n\n        The Constitution further states: “[t]he President shall\nbe Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United\nStates. . . .” Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 1. The President also “shall\ntake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed . . .” Id. § 3, cl.\n1.\n\n       Indeed, the only oblique reference to these\ncountervailing provisions of the Constitution appears in the\nmajority’s discussion of the unconstitutional conditions\ndoctrine, citing Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of\nVa., 515 U.S. 819 (1995) (public university could not\ncondition funds for student publications on their secular\nperspective); FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364\n(1984) (FCC could not condition federal funds to radio\nstations on editorial content); and Perry v. Sindermann, 408\nU.S. 593, 597 (1972) (relating to non-renewal of a contract\nand citing cases relating to denials of tax exemptions and\nwelfare payments, but emphasizing that “most often, we have\napplied the principle to denials of public employment”).\n\n       Significantly, my research has not discovered any\nreported case where an act of Congress exclusively predicated\n\n                                 70\n\fon supporting the military has been declared unconstitutional\nby application of the seminal doctrine that “[the government]\nmay not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his\nconstitutionally protected interests–especially, his interest in\nfreedom of speech.” Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526-\n529 (1958); see also Perry, 408 U.S. at 597. By reversing the\ndistrict court’s judgment, the majority has created new law,\ntotally unsupported by binding precedent. In doing so the\nmajority selects analogues to cases where state public\naccommodation statutes were involved and not a single case\nwhere an act of Congress was not only authorized by various\nClauses in Articles I and II, but commanded by them.\n\n         In the posture of this case, Appellants do not urge that\nthe Solomon Amendment is facially unconstitutional, but only\nthat it is unconstitutional as applied to the law schools\nbecause it offends their stated policies of anti-discrimination.\nTo succeed in their burden of overcoming the presumption of\nconstitutionality of the Solomon Amendment, they must first\ndemonstrate that the mere presence of recruiting officers on\ncampus constitutes a compellable inference that the law\nschools will be objectively and reasonably viewed as violating\ntheir anti-discrimination policies. If they succeed at that stage,\nthen they must demonstrate that the bite of the First\nAmendment under the facts of this case is so strong as to\noutweigh Congress’ interests to “provide for the common\nDefense . . .,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.; “declare War,\ngrant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules\n\n                               71\n\fconcerning Captures on Land and Water,” id. cl. 11; “raise\nand support Armies, id. cl. 12; “provide and maintain a\nNavy,” id. cl. 13; “make Rules for the Government and\nRegulation of the land and naval Forces,” id. cl. 14; and for\nthe President to “be Commander in Chief of the Army and\nNavy of the United States. . . .,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 1;\nand to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed . . .,”\nid. § 3, cl. 1.\n\n       Before proceeding into this analysis, it bears note that\nthe military’s policy against homosexual activity, codified at\n10 U.S.C. § 654, previously has been adjudged by a number\nof our sister courts of appeals not to violate the Constitution.\nSee, e.g., Richenberg v. Perry, 97 F.3d 256, 261 (8th Cir.\n1996) (“We join six other circuits in concluding that the\nmilitary may exclude those who engage in homosexual acts as\ndefined in [10 U.S.C.] § 654(f)(3)(A).”).\n\n        Moreover, in United States v. City of Phil., 798 F.2d\n81 (3d Cir. 1986) this court has discussed the very subject of\nthis appeal. In that case, the Temple School of Law’s\nplacement office invited the Judge Advocate General Corps\nof the Army, Navy and Marine Corps to participate in a job\nrecruiting program on its campus. he Philadelphia\nCommission on Human Relations issued an order restraining\nthe law school from doing so on the ground that the military\nservices did not accept homosexuals. We affirmed a district\ncourt order prohibiting the Commission from taking any\n\n                                 72\n\fadverse action. After reviewing Congressional legislation\nimplementing what we described as “the long standing\nCongressional policy of encouraging colleges and universities\nto cooperate with, and open their campuses to, military\nrecruiters,” we stated:\n\nWe believe that only one reasonable conclusion can be drawn\nfrom this legislation: Congress considers access to college and\nuniversity employment facilities by military recruiters to be a\nmatter of paramount importance. In other words, we think that\nCongress views such access an integral part of the military’s\neffort to conduct “intensive recruiting campaigns to obtain\nenlistments.” This conclusion is buttressed by the legislative\nhistory of these provisions. For example, a committee report\naccompanying the DDA Act of 1973 states, in pertinent part,\nthat “the Committee believes that [the] national interest is best\nserved by colleges and universities which provide for the full\nspectrum of opportunity for various career fields, including\nthe military field through the Reserve Officers Training Corps\nprogram, and by the opportunity for students to talk to all\nrecruiting sources, including military recruiters.” H.R.Rep No.\n92-1149, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 79 (1972). . . .\n\n       We conclude, therefore, that the Order conflicts with a\nclearly discernible Congressional policy concerning military\nrecruitment on the campuses of this nation’s colleges and\nuniversities.\n\n\n\n                               73\n\fId. at 86, 88. We do not write on a clean slate regarding the\nimportance Congress places in access to college and\nuniversity facilities by the military. We already have decided\nthat issue contrary to the argument pressed by the Appellants.\nAnd we made this determination almost twenty years ago.\n\n                              III.\n\n        Before we address the application of First Amendment\nprecepts, I am unwilling to accept that there is a permissible\ninference, let alone a compellable one, that a military presence\non campus to recruit, in and of itself, conjures up an\nimmediate impression of a discriminatory institution.\nThroughout our history, especially in times of war, like the\npresent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the military\ncampaign against the Al Qaeda, a completely different\nimpression is evoked. The men and women in uniform are\nalmost universally considered as heroes, sacrificing not only\ntheir lives and well-being, but living separate from all the\ncomforts of stateside living. Again in the current era, almost\nevery day, a candidate for President emphasized his four\nmonths as a swift boat commander in the Vietnam conflict.\nAs masters of public opinion, the political apparatus on both\nsides of the aisle certainly would not put a premium on\nmilitary service if the inference of the discrimination\nadvanced by Appellants here was attached thereto. Indeed, the\nrespect to the man and woman in uniform is so profound that\nin the same Presidential campaign, the other candidate was\n\n                              74\n\fcriticized for serving at home in a National Guard unit during\nthe Vietnam conflict instead of going overseas.\n\n        This view of service in the armed forces is at the\nfarthest polar extreme from the Appellants’ position that the\nmere presence of military recruiters conjures up the image of\nan institution that discriminates. That the military does so in\nfact, does not, in and of itself, generate the direct and\nuniversal feeling of loathing and abomination to the extent\nthat their presence on campus a few days a year deprives law\nschool institutions of rights inferred from the First\nAmendment.\n\n       What is involved here in the first instance is not\noperation of legal principles but precepts of logic that\ndetermine what can be properly inferred from stated\ncircumstances. An inference is a process in which one\nproposition (a factual conclusion) is arrived at and affirmed\non the basis of one or more other propositions, which were\naccepted as the starting point of the process. Professor\nStebbing observes that an inference “may be defined as a\nmental process in which a thinker passes from the\napprehension of something given, the datum, to something,\nthe conclusion, related in a certain way to the datum, and\naccepted only because the datum has been accepted.” L.S.\nStebbing, A M odern Introduction to Logic 211-212 (1948).\n\n       Inference is a process where the thinker passes from\n\n                               75\n\fone proposition to another that is connected with the former in\nsome way. But for the passage to be valid, it must be made\naccording to the laws of logic that permit a reasonable\nmovement from one proposition to another. Inference, then is\n“any passing from knowledge to new knowledge.” Joseph\nGerard Brennan, A Handbook of Logic 1 (1957). The passage\ncannot be mere speculation, intuition or guessing. The key to\na logical inference is the reasonable probability that the\nconclusion flows from the evidentiary datum because of past\nexperiences in human affairs. A moment is necessary to\ndiscuss the difference between inference and implication.\nThese terms are obverse sides of the same coin. We infer a\nconclusion from the data; the data imply a conclusion.\nProfessor Cooley explains:\n\n        [w]hen a series of statements is an instance of a valid\nform of inference, the conclusion will be said to follow from\nthe premises, and the premises to imply the conclusion. If a\nset of premises implies a conclusion, then, whenever the\npremises are accepted as true, the conclusion must be\naccepted as true also . . . .\n\nJohn C. Cooley, A Primer of Formal Logic 13 (1942).\n\n       As Professor Brennan put it: “In ordinary discourse,\n[implication] may mean ‘to give a hint,’ and [inference], ‘to\ntake a hint.’” Brennan, A Handbook of Logic at 2-3. Drawing\na proper inference is critical in this case, and this court has\n\n                               76\n\fheretofore suggested some broad guidelines:\n\n      The line between a reasonable inference that\n      may permissibly be drawn by a jury from basic\n      facts in evidence and an impermissible\n      speculation is not drawn by judicial\n      idiosyncracies. The line is drawn by the laws of\n      logic. If there is an experience of logical\n      probability that an ultimate fact will follow a\n      stated narrative or historical fact, then the jury is\n      given the opportunity to draw a conclusion\n      because there is a reasonable probability that the\n      conclusion flows from the proven facts. As the\n      Supreme Court has stated, “The essential\n      requirement is that mere speculation be not\n      allowed to do duty for probative facts after\n      making due allowance for all reasonably\n      possible inferences favoring the party whose\n      case is attacked.”\n\n\n\n\nTose v. First. Pa. Bank, N.A., 648 F.2d 879, 895 (3d Cir.\n1981) (quoting Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 395\n(1943)).\n\n        From these basic precepts of logic we cannot conclude\nthat the mere presence of a uniformed military recruiter\n\n                               77\n\fpermits or compels the inference that a law school’s anti-\ndiscrimination policy is violated. It bears repetition that the\npassage from datum to conclusion cannot be mere\nspeculation, intuition, or guessing, or by “judicial\nidiosyncracies.” The subjective idiosyncratic impressions of\nsome law students, some professors, or some anti-war\nprotesters are not the test. What we know as men and women\nwe cannot forget as judges. And this we know from\nelementary canons of logical processes—the validity vel non\nof a logical inference is the reasonable probability that the\nconclusion flows from the evidentiary datum because of past\nexperiences in human affairs.\n\n       A participant in a military operation cannot be ipso\nfacto denigrated as a member of a discriminatory institution.\nAnd conjuring up such an image is the cornerstone of\nAppellant’s First Amendment argument.\n\n       In my view it is not necessary to meet any First\nAmendment argument because given the evidentiary datum of\na military recruiter on campus for a few days, a proper\ninference may not be drawn that this, in and of itself, supports\na factual inference that the law school is violating its anti-\ndiscrimination policy. I think that this alone is sufficient to\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n      Nevertheless, I go further and assume that Appellants’\nsuggested inference may properly be drawn as a fact, and now\n\n                               78\n\fturn to a discussion of whether First Amendment concerns\ntrump the demands placed on Congress and the President\nunder Articles I and II to support the military.\n\n                              IV.\n\n        Our beginning point in approaching a First\nAmendment analysis is the balancing-of-interests test set forth\nin Justice Brennan’s important opinion in Roberts:\n\n       Determining the limits of state authorities over\n       an individual’s freedom to enter into a particular\n       association therefore unavoidably entails a\n       careful assessment of where that relationship’s\n       objective characteristics locate it on a spectrum\n       from the most intimate to the most attenuated of\n       personal attachments. . . . We need not mark the\n       potentially significant points on this terrain with\n       any precision.\n\n\n\n\n468 U.S. at 620 (emphasis added). Moreover, important for\nour immediate purposes is the recognition that “[t]he right to\nassociate for expressive purposes is not, however, absolute.\nInfringements on that right may be justified by regulations\nadopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the\nsuppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means\n\n                               79\n\fsignificantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.” Id. at\n623.\n\n        Although dealing with distinctions between abortions\nand other procedures, Justice Blackmun emphasized that in\nconstitutional matters we do not deal with absolutes. “The\nconstitutionality of such distinction will depend on its degree\nand the justification for it.” Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S. 132,\n149-150 (1976). For other cases discussing the necessity to\nweigh or balance conflicting interests, see also New York\nState Club Ass’n. Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U.S. 1\n(1988); Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club, 481 U.S.\n537 (1987); Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders\nInc, 472 U.S. 749, 758 (1985) (“We have long recognized that\nnot all speech is of equal First Amendment importance.”);\nOhralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447 (1978); Maher\nv. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 473 (1977); Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S.\n589, 599, 600 and nn.24 and 26 (1977); Zacchini v. Scripps-\nHoward Broad. Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977) (emphasizing that a\nline has to be drawn between media reports that are protected\nand those that are not).\n\n                               A.\n\n       I now turn to identify and then weigh competing\ninterests involved in this case. I have written elsewhere that\n“[a]n interest is a social fact, factor or phenomenon reflected\nby a claim or demand or desire which human beings, either\n\n                                80\n\findividually or as groups or associations or relations, seek to\nsatisfy and which has been recognized as socially valid by\nauthoritative decision makers in society.” Ruggero J. Aldisert,\nThe Judicial Process: Text, Materials and Cases 489 (2d ed.\n1996) (citing authorities). Two important interests conflict\nhere. Using the formulation of Dean Roscoe Pound, they are:\n(1) “an interest in general safety, long recognized in the legal\norder in the maxim that the safety of the people is the highest\nlaw;” and (2) the social interest in political progress and\nindividual mental self-assertion, taking form in “the [p]olicy\nin favor of free speech and free belief and opinion[.]” Roscoe\nPound, “A Survey of Social Interests,” 57 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 17,\n34 (1943).\n\n       The interest in public safety is expressed in the clauses\nof Articles I and II of the Constitution relating to support of\nthe military; the interest in free speech is found in the First\nAmendment.\n\n       I now proceed to weigh these interests.\n\n                               B.\n\n        What is perceived to be the flash point of controversy\nhere is whether the general interest in public safety has been\ntrumped by the interests embodied in the First Amendment.\nSupporting the government’s position are the line of cases\nemphasizing the Supreme Court’s deference to Congress’\n\n                               81\n\fsupport of the military. Arrayed against this is Appellant’s\ninsistence that the national defense interest is trumped by the\nteachings of Boy Scouts of Amer. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640\n(2000), and Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian &\nBisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557 (1995).\n\n       The Court has consistently deferred to congressional\ndecisions relating to the military. “The case arises in the\ncontext of Congress’s authority over national defense and\nmilitary affairs, and perhaps in no other area has the\n[Supreme] Court accorded Congress greater deference.”\nRostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64-65 (1981); see also\nWeiss v. United States, 510 U.S. 163, 177 (1994) (“Judicial\ndeference . . . ‘is at its apogee’ when reviewing congressional\ndecision making...” in the realm of military affairs). As the\nSupreme Court has explained, “[n]ot only is the scope of\nCongress’ constitutional power in this area broad, but the lack\nof competence on the part of the courts is marked.” Rostker,\n453 U.S. at 65; see also Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10\n(1973) (stating “it is difficult to conceive of an area of\ngovernmental activity in which the courts have less\ncompetence...”).\n\n        For example, in Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503\n(1986), the Court rejected a Free Exercise challenge to a\nmilitary dress regulation notwithstanding the plaintiff’s claim\nthat the military’s assessment of the need for the regulation\n“is mere ipse dixit, with no support from actual experience or\n\n                               82\n\fa scientific study in the record, and is contradicted by expert\ntestimony . . .” Id. at 509. As the Court explained, “whether or\nnot expert witnesses may feel that religious exceptions . . . are\ndesirable is quite beside the point[;] [t]he desirability of dress\nregulations in the military is decided by the appropriate\nmilitary officials, and they are under no constitutional\nmandate to abandon their considered professional judgment.”\nId.\n\n        Appellants suggest that even if the military requires\nphysical access to campuses, there is no need for military\nrecruiters to be given the same degree of access provided to\nother employers. It must be emphasized that even bare\nphysical access is more than the Appellants are willing to\ntolerate; they are asserting a constitutional right to exclude the\nmilitary from campuses altogether. Second, it is hardly\ncredible for the Appellants to suggest that physical access\nalone is sufficient for effective military recruiting, particularly\nwhen other employers are being granted far more extensive\nand meaningful access. It is fair to assume that all of the\nfacilities and services provided to prospective employers by\nlaw schools are intended to facilitate the hiring process. If\nmilitary recruiters are denied the ability to reach students on\nthe same terms as other employers, damage to military\nrecruiting is not simply probable but inevitable. The Solomon\nAmendment reflects Congress’ judgment about the\nrequirements of military recruiting, and “[t]he validity of such\nregulations does not turn on a judge’s agreement with the\n\n                                83\n\fresponsible decision maker concerning the most appropriate\nmethod for promoting significant government interests.”\nUnited States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 689 (1985).\n\n        What disturbs me personally and as a judge is that the\nlaw schools seem to approach this question as an academic\nexercise, a question on a constitutional law examination or a\nmoot court topic, with no thought of the effect of their action\non the supply of military lawyers and military judges in the\noperation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. They make\nit perfectly clear that they are not opposed to military\ninstitutions as such; they only want to curtail recruitment of\nmilitary lawyers and judges. It is important for private\nemployers to appear on campus to recruit law school\ngraduates for positions with law school-sponsored “On\nCampus Recruiting Days” or “On Campus Interviewing”\nreplete with interviews, followed by dinners and parties, but\nsomehow the military will recruit its lawyers without\nappearing on campus. Somehow, Appellants urge, better law\ngraduates will be attracted to the military legal branches with\nits lower pay and fewer benefits by some other recruiting\nmethod, for example, from the ranks of undergraduate ROTC\nprograms. 29 Much of Appellants’ brief takes the form of\n\n\n  29\n       The following colloquy took place at the oral argument:\n\nTHE COURT: What else could the government do as a less\nrestrictive alternative?\n\n                                84\n\fconclusory statements that the military is able to attract top of\nthe line or high quality students without stepping foot on\ncampus. There is no explanation, however, why the law\nschools consider it important to have private national law\nfirms come to campus and boast about first year associates’\nsalaries and signing bonuses and emphasize that if the\nstudents want to clerk for a federal judge for a year, the firm\nwill add another bonus. This is not only OK for the private\nsector, but also it’s good for the law school. But we don’t\nwant military recruiters to pollute our students. No, say the\nlaw schools, what’s sauce for the private sector goose is not\nsauce for the military gander. No, say the law schools, we\ndon’t need a level playing field; let the military shift for\nthemselves.\n\n       In its demand for total exclusion of military recruiters\nfrom their campuses, “fair play” is not a phrase in the law\nschools’ lexicon. They obviously do not desire that our men\nand women in the armed services, all members of a closed\nsociety, obtain optimum justice in military courts with the\nbest-trained lawyers and judges. It scarcely can be an\nexaggeration to suggest that in many respects the need for\n\n\nMR. ROSENKRANTZ: [A]ny number of things. Number one,\nROTC, the single most effective recruiting device the military\nhas, by their own admission.\n\n(Tr. at 25.)\n\n                               85\n\fspecially competent lawyers and exceptionally qualified\njudges may be more important in a settled environment\ndominated by the strictures of discipline than in the open\nsociety of civilian life.\n\n                              V.\n\n        I turn now to Appellants’ compelled speech argument.\nThey argue that the Solomon Amendment trenches on their\nfreedom of speech by compelling them to convey a message\nother than their own. In making this argument, the Appellants\nplace principal reliance on the teachings of Hurley v. Irish-\nAmerican Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston. The\ndistrict court recognized, however, that nothing in Hurley\nsuggests that the Solomon Amendment crosses the line into\nunconstitutionality. I agree completely and accept the\ngovernment’s analysis of this issue.\n\n                              A.\n\n       In Hurley, the Court held that a state public\naccommodation law could not constitutionally be applied to\ncompel organizers of a St. Patrick’s Day parade to allow a\ngroup of gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals to march in the\nparade for the purpose of conveying a public message about\nhomosexual pride and solidarity. 515 U.S. at 572-581. The\norganizers did not object to the participation of the group’s\nmembers in the parade; the only question was whether the\n\n                              86\n\fgroup could participate in the parade “as its own parade unit\ncarrying its own banner.” Id. at 572. The Court concluded that\nthe law’s “apparent object is simply to require speakers to\nmodify the content of their expression to whatever extent\nbeneficiaries of the law choose to alter it with messages of\ntheir own,” and that in so doing, the law “violates the\nfundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment[]\nthat a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his\nown message.” Id. at 573, 578.\n\n        Hurley involved an effort by the government to dictate\nthe content of a quintessential form of expressive activity—a\npublic parade. The Court emphasized that parades “are . . . a\nform of expression, not just motion,” and “the inherent\nexpressiveness of marching to make a point,” id. at 568,\nformed the predicate for its opinion. In contrast, there is\nnothing remotely so expressive about the activity of\nrecruiting. The military engages in recruiting on college\ncampuses for precisely the same reason as do other\nemployers: to hire employees. Recruiting is undertaken solely\nfor instrumental reasons, not expressive ones.\n\n        To be sure, recruiting involves speaking, but the\nrecruiter speaks purely as part of an economic transaction, and\nthe expression is entirely subordinate to the transaction itself.\nIt bears no resemblance to the activities of the would-be\nmarchers in Hurley, who formed their group “for the very\npurpose of marching” in the parade, and who sought to march\n\n                               87\n\f“as a way to express pride in their Irish heritage as openly\ngay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to demonstrate that\nthere are such men and women among those so descended,\nand to express their solidarity with like individuals who\nsought to march in New York’s St. Patrick’s Day parade.” Id.\nat 560, 570. In Hurley, unlike here, expression was not a\nsubsidiary part of an instrumental activity; expression was the\nactivity.\n\n       The role of the parade organizers in Hurley consisted\nof choosing the messages that would comprise the parade, and\nthe vice of the challenged statute was that the homosexual\ngroup’s protest message would be attributed to the organizers\nthemselves. The Court reasoned that the group’s participation\nin the parade “would likely be perceived as having resulted\nfrom the Council’s customary determination about a unit\nadmitted to the parade, that its message was worthy of\npresentation and quite possibly of support as well.” Id. at 575.\n\n       Here, in contrast, the likelihood that members of a law\nschool community will perceive a military recruiter’s on-\ncampus activities as reflecting the school’s “customary\ndetermination” that the recruiter’s message is “worthy of\npresentation and quite possibly of support” is vanishingly\nsmall. Unlike bystanders watching a passing parade, law\nschool students, and to be sure, their professors, are an\nextraordinarily sophisticated and well-informed group, who\nunderstand perfectly well that their schools admit military\n\n                              88\n\frecruiters not because they endorse any “message” that may\nbe conveyed by the recruiters’ brief and transitory appearance\non campus, but because the economic consequences of the\nSolomon Amendment have induced them to do so. The\nlikelihood that the military’s recruiting will be seen as part of\na law school’s own message is particularly small when\nschools can take— and have taken— ameliorative steps to\npublicize their continuing disagreement with the military’s\npolicies and the reasons for their acquiescence in military\nrecruiting.\n\n        There is nothing to prevent the law school\ncommunities from making speeches discouraging military\nrecruiting, posting signs and erecting huge billboards on\ncampus or public approaches announcing their opposition and\nstating their reasons. That this is an important consideration\nhas been emphasized by the Supreme Court in PruneYard\nShopping Ctr. v. Robbins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980):\n\n       [f]inally, as far as appears here appellants can\n       expressly disavow any connection with the\n       message by simply posting signs in the area\n       where the speakers or handbillers stand. Such\n       signs, for example, could disclaim any\n       sponsorship of the message and could explain\n       that the persons are communicating their own\n       messages by virtue of state law.\n\n\n\n                               89\n\fId. at 87.\n\n      Clearly, the interests expressed in Hurley lack the\npower to dilute the judiciary’s traditional deference to\nCongress in the interest of national defense.\n\n       In addition to arguing that the Solomon Amendment\ntrenches on freedom of speech simpliciter, the Appellants also\ncontend that the statute infringes on the law schools’ interests\nin expressive association. Although the First Amendment\nprovides a measure of protection to expressive association,\n“the Supreme Court has required a close relationship between\nthe [government] action and the affected expressive activity to\nfind a constitutional violation.” Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity, Inc.\nv. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 229 F.3d 435, 438 (3d Cir. 2000). In\nthe case at bar, the impact of the Solomon Amendment on the\nlaw schools’ interests in expressive association is far too\nremote to violate the First Amendment. In applying the\nbalancing-of-interests test of Roberts, I am persuaded that the\nlaw schools’ interests here fall at the remote extreme of\nJustice Brennan’s spectrum – “where that relationship’s\nobjective characteristics locate it . . . [near] the most\nattenuated of personal attachments.” 468 U.S. at 620. It is\nimportant to say again that “[t]he right to associate for\nexpressive purposes is not, however, absolute.” Id. at 623.\n\n       First Amendment claims based on expressive\nassociation are subject to a three-step constitutional inquiry.\n\n                               90\n\fSee Pi Lambda Phi, 229 F.3d at 442. The first question is\n“whether the group making the claim [is] engaged in\nexpressive association.” Id. If so, the next question is whether\nthe government action at issue “significantly affect[s] the\ngroup’s ability to advocate its viewpoints.” Id. If it does, the\nfinal question is whether the governmental interests served by\nthe law outweigh the burden imposed on the group's\nassociational interests. Id.; see also The Circle School v.\nPappert, 381 F.3d 172, 178 (3d Cir. 2004). In the case at bar\nthe district court found as a threshold matter that law schools\nare engaged in expressive association, but went on to\ndetermine that the Solomon Amendment does not place a\nsignificant burden on their associational interests and that, in\nany event, the governmental interests served by the Solomon\nAmendment outweigh whatever associational burden the law\nmay impose. (J.A. at 54-75.)\n\n                               C.\n\n        The majority invokes cases like Glickman v. Wileman\nBros. & Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457, 469-470 (1997), United\nStates v. United Foods. Inc., 533 U.S. 405 (2001), and\nCochran v. Veneman, 359 F. 3d 263, (3d Cir. 2004), for the\nproposition that the Solomon Amendment impermissibly\nobligates them to \"subsidize\" military recruiting. In all these\ncases the challenged statutes obligated individuals to make\ndirect payments of money to finance private speech with\nwhich they disagreed. Here, in contrast, the recruiting\n\n                               91\n\factivities of military recruiters are paid for exclusively with\nfederal tax revenues; the Solomon Amendment does not\nobligate educational institutions to pay one red cent to the\ngovernment or to a private organization. Although Appellants\ncomplain of having to provide \"scarce interview space\" and\n\"make appointments,\" (Appellant br. at 31), this kind of\nphysical accommodation simply does not present the\nconstitutional concern underlying cases like Abood ,\nGlickman, United Foods and Cochran—the concern that\ncompelling an individual to pay for someone else's speech\nimpinges on his right to \"believe as he will\" and to have his\nbeliefs \"shaped by his mind and his conscience rather than\ncoerced by the State.\" Abood, 431 U.S. at 235.\n\n       Unlike Abood, this case does not involve the right to\nmake or not make “contributions for political purposes.” 431\nU.S. at 234. Unlike Glickman, there was no mandatory\nassessments similar to those to be paid by growers of\nnectarines, plums and peaches under regulations 7 C.F.R.\nsections 916.31©), 917.35(f) promulgated under the\nAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act, 7 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.\nUnlike United Foods, there were no mandatory assessments\nsimilar to those imposed on mushroom producers for the\npurpose of funding generic mushroom advertisements under\nthe Mushroom Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6101. Unlike Cochran, there\nwere no mandatory assessments similar to those imposed on\nmilk producers under the Dairy Promotion Stabilization Act\nof 1983, 7 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq. The teachings of United\n\n                              92\n\fFoods and Cochran are not applicable because, unlike the\ncompelled advertising scheme in those cases, the principal\nobject of the Solomon Amendment is not communication of\nexpression but rather a furtherance of the government’s\ncompelling interest in raising and maintaining a military force\nas mandated by the Constitution. Unlike a regulatory scheme\nrequiring subsidization of generic advertising for fruit,\nmushrooms or milk, the Solomon Amendment “impose[s] no\nrestraint on the freedom of any [law school] to communicate\nany message to any audience . . . do[es] not compel any\nperson to engage in any actual or symbolic speech . . . [and]\ndo[es] not compel the [law schools] to endorse or to finance\nany political or ideological views.” Glickman v. Wileman\nBros. & Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457, 469-470 (1997).\n\n       Moreover, even if law schools were being required to\nprovide direct financial payments to the government to\nsupport military recruiting, which they manifestly are not, the\nFirst Amendment provides far more latitude for compelled\nfinancial support of governmental speech than it does for\ncompelled support of private speech. See Abood, 431 U.S. at\n259 n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in the judgment)\n(\"Compelled [financial] support of a private association is\nfundamentally different from compelled support of\ngovernment\"); United States v. Frame, 885 F.2d 1119, 1130-\n1133 (3rd Cir. 1989).\n\n       Finally, what we said in Frame is relevant here:\n\n                              93\n\fBoth the right to be free from compelled expressive\nassociation and the right to be free from compelled\naffirmation of belief presuppose a coerced nexus between the\nindividual and the specific expressive activity. When the\ngovernment allocates money from the general tax fund to\ncontroversial protects or expressive activities, the nexus\nbetween the message and the individual is attenuated.\n\n\n\n\n885 F. 2d at 1132.\n\n\n\n\n        It becomes necessary to say again that our task in this\ncase is to identify and weigh competing interests and to\nemphasize again that in applying the balancing-of-interests\ntest of Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984),\nthe law schools’ interests here fall at the remote extreme of\nJustice Brennan’s spectrum— “where that relationship’s\nobjective characteristics locate it . . . [near] the most\nattenuated of personal attachments.” 468 U.S. at 620.\n\n        The attempt to analogize the First Amendment\nconsiderations in compelling an individual to pay for someone\nelse's speech with a program of military recruiting fails\ncompletely because the extreme differences in the compared\nfactual scenarios totally dominate over any purported\n\n                              94\n\fresemblances. What we explained in In re Linerboard Anti\nTrust Litig., 305 F. 3d 145 (3d Cir. 2002), is appropriate here:\n\nTo draw an analogy between two entities is to indicate one or\nmore respects in which they are similar and thus argue that the\nlegal consequence attached to one set of particular facts may\napply to a different set of particular facts because of the\nsimilarities in the two sets. Because a successful analogy is\ndrawn by demonstrating the resemblances or similarities in\nthe facts, the degree of similarity is always the crucial\nelement. You cannot conclude that only a partial resemblance\nbetween two entities is equal to a substantial or exact\ncorrespondence.\n\n\n\n\nId. at 147.\n\n                              VI.\n\n       In challenging the district court’s reasoning,\nAppellants also seek to analogize this case to the teachings of\nDale. As the district court recognized, (J.A. 68-70), a\ncomparison of this case to Dale shows not why the Appellants\nshould prevail in this case, as urged by the majority, but why\nthey must lose, see id. at 648-650.\n\n       In Dale, the Court was presented with a New Jersey\n\n                               95\n\fpublic accommodations law that compelled the Boy Scouts of\nAmerica (“BSA”) to admit “an avowed homosexual and gay\nrights activist,” id. at 644, as an adult member and\nscoutmaster. The declared mission of the BSA was to “instill\nvalues in young people,” id. at 649, and disapproval of\nhomosexual conduct was one of BSA’s values. BSA relied on\nits scoutmasters to “inculcate [Boy Scouts] with the Boy\nScouts’ values—both expressly and by example.” Id. at 650.\nThe Court reasoned that “[t]he forced inclusion of an\nunwanted person in a group infringes the group’s freedom of\nexpressive association if the presence of that person affects in\na significant way the group’s ability to advocate public or\nprivate viewpoints.” Id. at 648. The Court found that “the\npresence of Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would surely\ninterfere with the Boy Scouts’ choice not to propound a point\nof view contrary to its beliefs,” because it would “force the\norganization to send a message, both to the youth members\nand the world, that the Boy Scouts accept[] homosexual\nconduct as a legitimate form of behavior.” Id. at 653-654.\n\n        Let me now count the two ways the Solomon\nAmendment differs from the state statute in Dale, both of\nwhich are critical to the law’s impact vel non on associational\ninterests. First, the Solomon Amendment simply does not\nimpinge on the right of educational institutions to determine\ntheir membership. See 10 U.S.C. § 983. It does not purport to\ntell colleges and universities whom to admit as students or\nwhom to hire as professors or administrators. It merely\n\n                               96\n\frequires them to allow the transient presence of recruiters,\nwho are not a part of the law school and do not become\nmembers through their mere presence. In contrast to the\nscoutmaster in Dale, recruiters do not purport to speak\n“for”—and cannot reasonably be understood to be speaking\n“for”—the law schools that they are visiting. This case thus\ndoes not involve “[t]he forced inclusion of an unwanted\nperson in a group.” Dale, 530 U.S. at 648. It cannot be denied\nthat this was the genesis of the constitutional injury in Dale.\n\n        Second, as noted in my discussion of Hurley, recruiting\nis an economic activity whose expressive content is strictly\nsecondary to its instrumental goals. In contrast, the\nfundamental goal of the relationship between adult leaders\nand boys in the Boy Scout movement is “[t]o instill values in\nyoung people,” a goal that is pursued “by example” as well as\nby word. Id. at 649, 650. As a result, compelling the BSA to\nappoint an adult leader who was committed to “advocacy of\nhomosexual teenagers’ need for gay role models,” id. at 645,\nstruck at the heart of the organization’s goals.\n\n       Military recruiting is not intended to “instill values” in\nanyone, nor is it meant to convey any message beyond the\nmilitary’s interest in enlisting qualified men and women to\nserve as military lawyers and judges. As a result, the burden\non the law schools’ associational interests is vastly less\nsignificant than the burden imposed on the BSA by the statute\nin Dale.\n\n                               97\n\f        These profound distinctions demonstrate that the\nteachings of Dale lack the power to dilute the judiciary’s\ntraditional deference to Congress in the interest of national\ndefense.\n\n                              VII.\n\n        I now turn to the proper measure by which to evaluate\nthe weighing of competing interests implicated in this case.\nThere should be no question that the teachings of United\nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), control. In that case,\nthe Court considered whether a 1965 amendment to the\nUniversal Military Training and Service Act, which\nprohibited the knowing destruction or mutilation of a\nSelective Service Registration Certificate, was\nunconstitutional as applied to a man who burned his\ncertificate as a symbolic expression of his antiwar beliefs. Id.\nat 369-370. The Court stated:\n\n       We cannot accept the view that an apparently\n       limitless variety of conduct can be labeled\n       “speech” whenever the person engaging in the\n       conduct intends thereby to express an idea.\n       However, even on the assumption that the\n       alleged communicative element in O’Brien’s\n       conduct is sufficient to bring into play the First\n       Amendment, it does not necessarily follow that\n       the destruction of a registration certificate is\n\n                               98\n\f       constitutionally protected activity. This Court\n       has held that when “speech” and “nonspeech”\n       elements are combined in the same course of\n       conduct, a sufficiently important governmental\n       interest in regulating the nonspeech element can\n       justify incidental limitations on First\n       Amendment freedoms.\n\n\n\n\nId. at 376.\n\n        In this case, the law schools portray their efforts to\nkeep military recruiters off their campuses as “quintessential\nexpression.” (Appellant br. at 20.) But when an institution\nexcludes military recruiters from its campuses or otherwise\nrestricts their access to students, it is engaging in something\ndifferent from “quintessential expression.” It is engaging in a\ncourse of conduct which contains both nonspeech and speech\nelements. The acts which the law schools claim they are\ncompelled to do by virtue of the military’s post-2001\n“unwritten policy”—disseminating and posting military\nrecruitment literature, making appointments for military\nrecruiters to meet with students and providing military\nrecruiters a place to meet with students—also contain both\nnonspeech and speech elements.\n\n       The constitutional framework for evaluating such laws\n\n                              99\n\fis provided by O’Brien. Regulation of conduct that imposes\nincidental burdens on expression is constitutional if “it\nfurthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if\nthe governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of\nfree expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged\nFirst Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to\nthe furtherance of that interest.” 391 U.S. at 377. “[A]n\nincidental burden on speech is no greater than is essential, and\ntherefore is permissible under O’Brien, so long as the neutral\nregulation promotes a substantial government interest that\nwould be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.”\nAlbertini, 472 U.S. at 689. Regulations of conduct that place\nincidental burdens on expression are not subject to a least-\nrestrictive-alternative requirement “[s]o long as the means\nchosen are not\n\nsubstantially broader than necessary to achieve the government’s\ninterest, . . . the regulation will not be invalid simply because a\ncourt concludes that the government's interest could be\nadequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative.”\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 800 (1989).\n\n       The Solomon Amendment readily passes constitutional\nmuster under these constitutional standards. The Appellants\nthemselves do not dispute that the government has a substantial\ninterest—indeed, a compelling one— in recruiting talented men\nand women for the nation’s armed forces. As the Court\nrecognized in O’Brien, “the Nation has a vital interest in having\na system for raising armies that functions with maximum\n\fefficiency . . .” 391 U.S. at 381. Effective military recruiting is\nthe linchpin of that system. See City of Phil., 798 F.2d at 86\n(“Congress considers access to college and university\nemployment facilities by military recruiters to be a matter of\nparamount importance.”)\n\n        The government’s interest in military recruiting, as\nembodied in the Solomon Amendment, is manifestly “unrelated\nto the suppression of free expression.” O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 377.\nThe Solomon Amendment makes no effort to condition federal\nfunding on the absence of campus criticism of military policies;\na law school and its faculty and students are free to denounce\nmilitary recruiting policies without jeopardizing federal funding\nin the slightest. The only thing that\n\nmatters under the Solomon Amendment is whether the\ninstitution is denying access to military recruiters. And if the\ninstitution is denying access, it is irrelevant under the Solomon\nAmendment whether its reasons for doing so are communicative\n(to convey a message about its own principles or those of the\nmilitary) or non-communicative (for example, to avoid\nparticipation in a recruiting process that it regards as unfair).\nWhat matters under the Solomon Amendment is “only the\nindependent noncommunicative impact of [the] conduct,” id. at\n382,—its impact on the ability of the military to reach students.\n\n      The Appellants argue that because the Solomon\nAmendment is intended to facilitate military recruiting, and\nbecause recruiters speak to students, the governmental interest\n\funderlying the Solomon Amendment “is not unrelated to\nexpression.” (Appellant br. at 26.) But the question posed by\nO’Brien is not whether the governmental interest is “unrelated\nto expression,” but instead whether the interest “is unrelated to\nthe suppression of free expression.” 391 U.S. at 377 (emphasis\nadded). The Appellants’ argument deliberately omits the\ntouchstone of suppression from the constitutional test. Once it\nis recognized that suppression of expression is the focus of\nO’Brien, the Appellants’ argument falls apart, for the\ngovernmental interests served by the Solomon Amendment are\nmanifestly unrelated to the suppression of anyone’s expression.\n\n       It bears constant emphasis that the First Amendment test\ninvolves a balancing-of-interests as repeatedly emphasized\nabove. The O’Brien measure is quintessentially correct because\nthis case involves a weighing of the government’s interest in\nnational defense and Appellants’ interest in First Amendment\nprotections. In this posture it is difficult to conjure a case that is\na more perfect fit for the exposition in O’Brien.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                102\n\f",

Law Schools’ Nondiscrimination Policies\n\n       Law schools have long maintained formal policies of\nnondiscrimination that withhold career placement services\nfrom employers who exclude employees and applicants based\non such factors as race, gender, and religion. In the 1970s law\nschools began expanding these policies to prohibit\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation as well. In\nresponse to this trend the American Association of Law\nSchools (“AALS”) voted unanimously in 1990 to include\nsexual orientation as a protected category. As a result,\n\n\n     2\n    The facts on appeal are not in dispute. As the District Court\nnoted, the Government did not challenge or supplement the\nfactual assertions presented by FAIR in its motion for injunctive\nrelief. FAIR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Congress Passes the Solomon Amendment\n\n       The United States military excludes servicemembers\nbased on evidence of homosexual conduct and/or orientation.\nSee 10 U.S.C. § 654.3 Citing their nondiscrimination policies,\n\n\n     3\n      While the current statutory version of the military’s\nexclusionary policy has existed since 1993, National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-160, §\n571(a)(1), 107 Stat. 1547, 1670 (Nov. 30, 1993), the military has\nhad formal regulatory policies excluding gays and lesbians since\nWorld War I and a practice of such exclusion since the\n\n                                 8\n\fsome law schools began in the 1980s refusing to provide\naccess and assistance to military recruiters. This caught the\nattention of members of Congress. In 1994, Representative\nGerald Solomon of New York sponsored an amendment to\nthe annual defense appropriation bill that proposed to\nwithhold DOD funding from any educational institution with\na policy of denying or effectively preventing the military from\nobtaining entry to campuses (or access to students on\ncampuses) for recruiting purposes. National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Pub. L. No. 103-337\n\n\n\nRevolutionary War. See, e.g., Articles of War of 1916, Pub. L.\nNo. 242, art. 93, 39 Stat. 619, 664 (assault with intent to commit\nsodomy punishable by court martial); see generally Randy\nShilts, Conduct Unbecoming: Gays & Lesbians in the U.S.\nMilitary 11–17 (1994).\n        Under the current statute, a servicemember is separated\nfrom the military if it is found that he or she “engaged in . . . a\nhomosexual act” or “stated that he or she is a homosexual” or\n“married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the\nsame biological sex.” 10 U.S.C. § 654(b). It defines\n“homosexual” and “homosexual act” to include evidence\ndemonstrating “a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual\nacts.” Id. It also allows servicemembers to rebut findings of\nproscribed conduct with evidence of the lack of a propensity to\nengage in homosexual conduct, i.e., evidence of a heterosexual\norientation. Id. Law schools interpret the ban as conflicting\nwith their policies against discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation.\n\n                                9\n\f§ 558, 108 Stat. 2663, 2776 (1994).\n\n        During debate in the House of Representatives,\nRepresentative Solomon urged the passage of his amendment\n“on behalf of military preparedness” because “recruiting is the\nkey to an all-volunteer military.” 140 Cong. Rec. H3861\n(daily ed. May 23, 1994). He argued that it was hypocritical\nfor schools to receive federal money while at the same time\ndenying the military access to their campuses: “[T]ell[]\nrecipients of Federal money at colleges and universities that if\nyou do not like the Armed Forces, if you do not like its\npolicies, that is fine. That is your [F]irst [A]mendment\nright[]. But do not expect Federal dollars to support your\ninterference with our military recruiters.” Id. The\namendment’s co-sponsor, Representative Richard Pombo of\nCalifornia, said Congress needed to target “policies of\nambivalence or hostility to our Nation’s armed services” that\nare “nothing less than a backhanded slap at the honor and\ndignity of service in our Nation’s Armed Forces.” Id. at\nH3863. He urged his colleagues to “send a message over the\nwall of the ivory tower of higher education” that colleges’ and\nuniversities’ “starry-eyed idealism comes with a price. If they\nare too good—or too righteous—to treat our Nation’s military\nwith the respect it deserves[,] then they may also be too good\nto receive the generous level of taxpayer dollars presently\nenjoyed by many institutions of higher education in America.”\nId.\n\n\n\n                              10\n\f        Other Representatives opposed the amendment,\nalleging violations of academic freedom and civil rights. See,\ne.g., id. at H3862 (Rep. Dellums) (“We should not . . . chill or\nabridge privacy, speech, or conscience by threatening a\ncollege with a Federal funds termination because it chose for\nwhatever reason to deny access to military recruiters . . . . We\nshould not browbeat them . . . into becoming involuntary\nagents of Federal policy.”). In light of Vietnam War-era\nlegislation, rarely invoked, that already granted the DOD\ndiscretion to withhold funding from colleges and universities\nthat barred military recruiters, see Pub. L. No. 92-436, § 606,\n86 Stat. 734, 740 (1972), the DOD itself objected to the\nproposed amendment as “unnecessary” and “duplicative.” 140\nCong. Rec. H3864 (Rep. Schroeder) (explaining the DOD’s\nposition). The DOD also feared that withholding funds from\nuniversities could be potentially harmful to defense research\ninitiatives. Id. But the House voted for the amendment by a\nvote of 271 to 126. Id. at H3865. Several months later the\nSenate approved the defense spending appropriations bill,\nincluding Representative Solomon’s amendment, and the\n“Solomon Amendment” ultimately became law.\n\nC.     Subsequent Amendments and Regulatory\n       Interpretations\n\n       In 1997 Congress amended the Solomon Amendment\nby expanding its penalty to include, in addition to DOD funds,\nfunds administered by other federal agencies, including the\n\n                              11\n\fDepartments of Transportation,4 Labor, Health and Human\nServices, and Education.5 Omnibus Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 1997, Pub. L. No. 104–208, § 514(b),\n110 Stat. 3009–270 (1996). This amendment was recodified\nin another amendment in 1999. National Defense\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, Pub. L. No. 106–65,\n§ 549, 113 Stat. 512, 609–11 (1999). DOD regulations have\nclarified this expansion, penalizing an offending\n“subelement” of a college or university (i.e., a law school)\nthat prohibits or effectively prevents military recruiting with\nthe loss of federal funding from all of the federal agencies\nidentified in the statute, while withholding from the offending\nsubelement’s parent institution only DOD funds. 32 C.F.R. §\n216.3(b)(1).\n\n       The 1999 amendment also codified exceptions to the\nSolomon Amendment’s penalties for schools that (1) have\nceased an offending policy or practice, or (2) have a\nlongstanding religious-based policy of pacifism. § 549, 113\n\n\n\n    4\n     Department of Homeland Security funds later replaced\nDepartment of Transportation funds. Pub. L. No. 107-296,\n§ 1704(b)(1), 116 Stat. 2314 (2002).\n    5\n     A separate amendment cancelled the application of the\nSolomon Amendment to direct student aid. Department of\nDefense Appropriations Act of 2000, § 8120, Pub. L. No. 106-\n79, 113 Stat. 1212, 1260 (1999).\n\n                              12\n\fStat. at 610(c) (codified at 10 U.S.C. § 983(c)). DOD\nregulations subsequently added a third exception for schools\nthat provide military recruiters a degree of access equal to that\nprovided to other recruiters. 32 C.F.R. § 216.4(c).\n\n        Following the 1999 amendment, the DOD enforced the\nSolomon Amendment consistent with its terms. Only schools\nwhose policies or practices “prohibit[ed], or in effect\nprevent[ed],” military representatives “from gaining entry to\ncampuses, or access to students . . . on campuses for purposes\nof military recruiting,” were penalized. Thus, by merely\nallowing military recruiters to gain access to campuses, many\nlaw schools avoided the Solomon Amendment’s penalty while\nreaffirming their opposition to the military’s exclusionary\nemployment policy by not providing them affirmative\nassistance in the manner provided to other recruiters. Harvard\nLaw School, for example, allowed military recruiters on\ncampus to recruit at the offices of its Veterans Association but\ndid not volunteer its placement personnel to arrange\ninterviews. Boston College Law School allowed military\nrecruiters to conduct on-campus interviews, but kept their\nliterature in the library rather than in the career services\noffice. Until the fall of 2001, the DOD did not consider these\nand other similar “ameliorative measures” to violate the\nSolomon Amendment and expressed enthusiasm for the law\nschools’ cooperation with what it described as successful\nrecruiting efforts. See FAIR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 282 (citing\nrecord evidence).\n\n                               13\n\f        But following the terrorist attacks in the United States\nin September 2001, the DOD began applying an informal\npolicy of requiring not only access to campuses, but treatment\nequal to that accorded other recruiters. As evidence of this\ninformal policy, a letter from the DOD’s Acting Deputy\nUndersecretary William J. Carr to Richard Levin, the\nPresident of Yale University, stated that universities are\nrequired “to provide military recruiters access to students\nequal in quality and scope to that provided to other\nrecruiters.” 6 The same letter stated that the “DOD requires\nthat there not be a substantial disparity in the treatment of\nmilitary recruiters as compared to other potential employers.”\nThis changed context meant that Yale’s willingness to let\nmilitary recruiters use a room in Yale Law School’s building\nfor interviews would not pass muster unless it also provided\nmilitary recruiters with the same level of assistance from its\ncareer development office (arranging interviews, posting\nnotices, etc.) provided to other recruiters. Furthermore, the\nDOD intimated that failure to comply would result in a loss to\n\n\n      6\n       In wording the new informal policy’s substantive\nrequirement, the DOD borrowed language from the existing\npolicy’s regulatory exception—32 C.F.R. 216.4(c) (exempting\nfrom Solomon Act compliance a law school that “presents\nevidence that the degree of access by military recruiters is at\nleast equal in quality and scope to that afforded to other\nemployers”).\n\n\n                               14\n\fYale University not only of DOD funds, but of all federal\nfunds (a penalty that is not consistent with the DOD’s existing\nregulations, under which the offending subelement’s parent\ninstitution is penalized with the loss of only DOD funds, see\n32 C.F.R. § 216.3(b)(1)).\n\n        In another example, the DOD advised the University of\nSouthern California Law School in 2002 that its past practice\nof accommodating military recruiters—providing them with\nstandard employer information, referring them to the campus\nROTC office for scheduling of interview office space, posting\nnotices in the weekly newsletter for students, and making\nmilitary recruitment materials available to students—would\nviolate the Solomon Amendment unless its career services\noffice invited military recruiters to participate in an off-\ncampus job fair open to other employers. According to the\nDOD, anything less than equal treatment for military\nrecruiters “sends the message that employment in the Armed\nForces is less honorable or desirable than employment with\nother organizations”—a dangerous message to be sending “in\ntoday’s military climate.” In light of the millions of dollars at\nstake, every law school that receives federal funds had, by the\n2003 recruiting season, suspended its nondiscrimination\npolicy as applied to military recruiters.\n\n      This past summer Congress amended the Solomon\nAmendment to codify the DOD’s informal policy. Ronald W.\nReagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year\n\n                               15\n\f2005, Pub. L. No. 108–375, § 552, 118 Stat. 1811, 1911\n(2004). Now, under the terms of the statute itself, law schools\nand their parent institutions are penalized for preventing\nmilitary representatives from gaining entry to campuses for\nthe purpose of military recruiting “in a manner that is at least\nequal in quality and scope to the [degree of] access to\ncampuses and to students that is provided to any other\nemployer.” 10 U.S.C. § 983(b).\n\nD.     Current Litigation\n\n       In September 2003, FAIR sued the DOD and the other\nfederal departments whose funds are restricted under the\nSolomon Amendment, seeking on constitutional grounds a\npreliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the statute\nand the then-existing (now codified) informal policy. The\nGovernment defendants moved to dismiss for lack of\nstanding. The District Court denied both the motion to\ndismiss and FAIR’s motion for preliminary injunction.

Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine\n\n      FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment is an\nunconstitutional condition.8 Under the unconstitutional\n\n  8\n    Our dissenting colleague urges us to begin our analysis with\nthe presumption that congressional statutes are constitutional.\nIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that, when\nthere are “‘two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of\nwhich it would unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain\nduty is to adopt that which will save the Act.’” Rust v. Sullivan,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 190 (1991) (quoting Blodgett v.

This simple commandment plays out\ndifferently depending on the avenue of analysis. Two\navenues applicable here are: (1) whether the law schools are\n“expressive associations” whose First Amendment right to\ndisseminate their chosen message is impaired by the inclusion\nof military recruiters on their campuses; and (2) whether the\nlaw schools are insulated by free speech protections from\nbeing compelled to assist military recruiters in the expressive\n\n\n\n\n299–300.

The levels\nof scrutiny applicable in the First Amendment context are\ncrucial. A regulation that disrupts an expressive association\nor compels speech must be narrowly tailored to serve a\ncompelling governmental interest, and must use the least\nrestrictive means of promoting the Government’s asserted\ninterest (here, recruiting talented lawyers). See infra Parts\n\n\n   10\n     FAIR also argues that the Solomon Amendment and the\nthen-existing informal policy are void under the First\nAmendment’s vagueness doctrine because they provide\ninsufficient notice as to what activities will trigger funding\npenalties.

See infra Part\nIII.B.3(b). We emphasize at the outset that we need not\ndecide this issue because we conclude that the Solomon\nAmendment violates the First Amendment by impeding the\nlaw schools’ rights of expressive association and by\ncompelling them to assist in the expressive act of recruiting.\nNonetheless, we explain briefly our conclusion that FAIR\nwould prevail even under O’Brien’s less strict framework.\n\n       1.     Expressive Association\n\n       FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment impairs\nlaw schools’ First Amendment rights under the doctrine of\nexpressive association. The Supreme Court most recently\naddressed this doctrine in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). There the Court held that a state public\naccommodations law that prohibited discrimination based on\n\n                               22\n\fsexual orientation could not constitutionally be invoked to\nforce the Boy Scouts to accept openly gay James Dale as an\nassistant scoutmaster. Id. at 659. Central to its analysis was\nthe deference it gave to the Boy Scouts’ “view of what would\nimpair its expression,” which compelled the Court’s\nconclusion that Dale’s presence would “significantly burden\nthe Boy Scouts’ desire to not ‘promote homosexual conduct\nas a legitimate form of behavior.’” Id. at 653 (citation\nomitted).\n\n       Under Dale, the elements of an expressive association\nclaim are (1) whether the group is an “expressive\nassociation,” (2) whether the state action at issue significantly\naffects the group’s ability to advocate its viewpoint, and (3)\nwhether the state’s interest justifies the burden it imposes on\nthe group’s expressive association.

The Supreme\nCourt held that the Boy Scouts, which “seeks to transmit . . . a\nsystem of values, engages in expressive activity.” Id. at 650.\n\n       “By nature, educational institutions are highly\nexpressive organizations, as their philosophy and values are\ndirectly inculcated in their students.” The Circle School, 381\nF.3d at 182. Because FAIR has shown that the law schools\n“possess[] clear educational philosophies, missions and\ngoals,” id., we agree with the District Court’s conclusion that\nthey qualify as expressive associations.

Therefore, FAIR satisfies the first element of\nthe Dale analysis.\n\n              (b)    The Solomon Amendment significantly\n                     affects the law schools’ ability to express\n                     their viewpoint.\n\n       FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment\nsignificantly affects law schools’ ability to express their\nviewpoint, reflected in their policies, that discrimination on\nthe basis of sexual orientation is wrong. The Solomon\nAmendment compels them, they contend, to disseminate the\nopposite message. The schools believe that, by coordinating\ninterviews and posting and publishing recruiting notices of an\nemployer who discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation,\nthey impair their ability to teach an inclusive message by\n\n                               24\n\fexample. Put another way, FAIR maintains that the Solomon\nAmendment suppresses the law schools’ chosen speech by\ninterfering with their prerogative to shape the way they\neducate (including, of course, the manner in which they\ncommunicate their message).\n\n       In Dale, the Supreme Court recognized that “[t]he\nforced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group” could\nsignificantly affect the group’s ability to advocate its public or\nprivate viewpoint. 530 U.S. at 648. The viewpoint at issue in\nDale was the Boy Scouts’ long-held belief that “homosexual\nconduct is inconsistent with . . . the Scout Oath” and that\n“homosexuals [do not] provide a role model consistent with\nthe[] expectations [of Scouting families].” Id. at 652.\nBecause the Boy Scouts’ expressive purpose was to “inculcate\n[youth] with the Boy Scouts’ values—both expressively and\nby example,” id. at 649–50, the organization believed that the\npresence of an openly gay assistant scoutmaster could be\nperceived as “promot[ing] homosexual conduct as a\nlegitimate form of behavior,” a message inconsistent with the\nexpression it wished to convey and the example it wished to\nset. Id. at 651.\n\n        The Supreme Court agreed. Because James Dale was\nopenly gay, his “presence in the Boy Scouts would, at the very\nleast, force the organization to send a message, both to youth\nmembers and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts\nhomosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.” Id. at\n\n                               25\n\f653.\n\n        Just as the Boy Scouts believed that “homosexual\nconduct is inconsistent with the Scout Oath,” id. at 652, the\nlaw schools believe that employment discrimination is\ninconsistent with their commitment to justice and fairness.\nJust as the Boy Scouts maintained that “homosexuals do not\nprovide a role model consistent with the expectations of\nScouting families,” id., the law schools maintain that military\nrecruiters engaging in exclusionary hiring “do not provide a\nrole model consistent with the expectations of,” id., their\nstudents and the legal community. Just as the Boy Scouts\nendeavored to “inculcate [youth] with the Boy Scouts’\nvalues—both expressively and by example,” id. at 649–50,\nthe law schools endeavor to “inculcate” their students with\ntheir chosen values by expression and example in the\npromulgation and enforcement of their nondiscrimination\npolicies. FAIR Br. at 22–25. And just as “Dale’s presence in\nthe Boy Scouts would, at the very least, force the organization\nto send a message, both to youth members and the world, that\nthe Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate\nform of behavior,” Dale, 530 U.S. at 653, the presence of\nmilitary recruiters “would, at the very least, force the law\nschools to send a message,” both to students and the legal\ncommunity, that the law schools “accept” employment\ndiscrimination “as a legitimate form of behavior.” Id.\n\n       Notwithstanding this compelling analogy, the District\n\n                              26\n\fCourt distinguished our case from Dale by suggesting there\nwas a critical difference between the forced inclusion of a gay\nassistant scoutmaster and the forced presence of an\n“unwanted periodic visitor,” the military recruiter, in the\ncontext of a larger recruiting effort. FAIR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n304, 305. While there was “no question” that the gay\nscoutmaster would “undermine the Boy Scouts’ ability\nto . . . inculcate its values in younger members,” the District\nCourt wrote, the Solomon Amendment does not compel the\nlaw schools to accept the military recruiters as a “member”\nand does not “bestow upon them any semblance of authority.”\nId. at 305.\n\n        But our Court has recently held that compulsory\naccommodation of a government-prescribed message may\nviolate schools’ First Amendment expressive association\nrights, even when that message involves our most revered\naffirmations of American patriotism—the Pledge of\nAllegiance and our National Anthem, is only minimally\nintrusive and lacks the schools’ imprimatur. The Circle\nSchool, 381 F.3d at 182 (holding that a statute requiring\nprivate schools to lead the Pledge of Allegiance and National\nAnthem violates their rights under the expressive association\ndoctrine—“Certainly, the temporal duration of a burden on\nFirst Amendment rights is not determinative of whether there\nis a constitutional violation . . . . Similarly, the fact that the\nschools can issue a general disclaimer does not erase the First\nAmendment infringement at issue here, for the schools are\n\n                                27\n\fstill compelled to speak the [Government’s] message.”). If\nthe Pledge and Anthem “only take[] a very short period of\ntime each day,” and may be preceded by “a general disclaimer\nregarding the recitation,” yet do not “erase the First\nAmendment infringement at issue here,” id., then focusing on\nthe periodic nature of the military recruiter’s visits 11 is\nsimilarly unavailing.\n\n        Moreover, the District Court’s scrutiny of the law\nschools’ belief that the presence of military recruiters will\nundermine their expressive message about fairness and social\njustice violates the Dale Court’s instruction to “give\ndeference to an association’s view of what would impair its\nexpression.” 530 U.S. at 653.12 In Dale, the Court did more\n\n\n 11\n    Furthermore, the Solomon Amendment requires law schools\nto do more than passively accept the presence of an “unwanted\nperiodic visitor.” They must actively assist military recruiters in\na manner equal in quality and scope to the assistance they\nprovide other recruiters. 10 U.S.C. § 983(b)(1).\n      12\n      Dale may appear to depart from prior Supreme Court\njurisprudence in this area. In two expressive association cases\nfrom the 1980s, the Court considered the claims of civic\nassociations that state statutes forcing them to accept women as\nmembers violated their expressive association rights.

In both cases\n\n                                28\n\fthan pay lip service to deference notions. Deference\ndistinguished the Supreme Court’s conclusion on the\nimpairment question from that of the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt, which had decided the case previously. The state court\nhad ruled in Dale’s favor, holding that because the Boy\nScouts have a policy of “discourag[ing] its leaders from\ndisseminating any views on sexual issues,” Dale’s presence\n\n\n\nthe Court examined the organizations’ expressive charitable and\nhumanitarian purposes and determined that they would not be\nimpaired by the forced inclusion of women members. Duarte,\n481 U.S. at 548–49; Roberts, 468 U.S. at 626–27. The\ndifference in outcome between these cases and Dale—the civic\nassociations had to admit women, but the Boy Scouts did not\nhave to admit Dale—underscores the significance of the Court’s\ndecision to extend “deference to an association’s view of what\nwould impair its expression.” 530 U.S. at 653.\n       Moreover, we note that the Supreme Court had\npreviously extended deference to what an expressive association\nsaid would impair its expression.

City of\nPhiladelphia, however, is distinguishable from this case in two\nimportant respects. First, in that case the university invited the\nmilitary recruiters on campus; the recruiters’ presence was not\neffectively dictated by a statute, as is the case here. Id. at 83.\nSecond, City of Philadelphia engaged in a conflict preemption\nanalysis and held that, because it was not possible for the\nuniversity to comply with both a Philadelphia anti-\ndiscrimination ordinance and the clear congressional policy\nconcerning military recruitment on campus, the ordinance was\npreempted.

Therefore, neither this Court’s prior\nacknowledgment of the importance Congress places on military\nrecruiting on college and university campuses, nor our\npresumption in this case that there is an important governmental\ninterest in attracting talented lawyers to the military, ends our\nanalysis.

Unlike a typical employer, the military\nhas ample resources to recruit through alternative means. For\nexample, it may generate student interest by means of loan\nrepayment programs. And it may use sophisticated\nrecruitment devices that are generally too expensive for use\nby civilian recruiters, such as television and radio\nadvertisements. These methods do not require the assistance\nof law school space or personnel. And while they may be\nmore costly, the Government has given us no reason to\nsuspect that they are less effective than on-campus recruiting.\n\n       The availability of alternative, less speech-restrictive\nmeans of effective recruitment is sufficient to render the\nSolomon Amendment unconstitutional under strict scrutiny\nanalysis. Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; The Circle School, 381 F.3d\nat 182. But our path in this case is even clearer. The\nGovernment has failed to proffer a shred of evidence that the\n\n\nAmendment is narrowly tailored to achieve the Government’s\nends.\n\n\n                               33\n\fSolomon Amendment materially enhances its stated goal.\nAnd not only might other methods of recruitment yield\nacceptable results, they might actually fare better than the\ncurrent system. In fact, it may plausibly be the case that the\nSolomon Amendment, which has generated much ill will\ntoward the military on law school campuses,16 actually\nimpedes recruitment. 17\n\n\n  16\n    See, e.g., FAIR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

[near] the\nmost attenuated of personal attachments.’” This balancing test,\nhowever, comes not from the portion of Roberts dealing with\nfreedom of expressive association, but from the portion dealing\nwith freedom of intimate association. The law schools are\nclearly not intimate associations, and where they may fall on the\nspectrum articulated by Justice Brennan for determining whether\nparticular relationships merit protection under that doctrine is\nirrelevant to our analysis here. In Roberts, the Court went on to\nengage in a strict scrutiny expressive association analysis and\napplied the balancing test we apply here, determining that the\nGovernment had a compelling interest in eliminating\ndiscrimination and that the statute at issue was the least\nrestrictive means of achieving that end. Roberts, 468 U.S. at\n620.\n\n                                34\n\f               *       *       *      *       *\n\n       FAIR likely satisfies the three elements of an\nexpressive association claim.

We disagree. As we explain in the\nanalysis that follows, the military’s recruiting is expressive of\na message with which the law schools disagree. To comply\nwith the Solomon Amendment, the law schools must\naffirmatively assist military recruiters in the same manner\nthey assist other recruiters, which means they must propagate,\naccommodate, and subsidize the military’s message.

So understood, recruiting\nnecessarily involves “communication of information, the\ndissemination and propagation of views and ideas, and the\nadvocacy of causes”—the hallmarks of First Amendment\nexpression.

We\npart, however, on the notion that efforts to raise a legal staff\nare “economic or functional” while efforts to raise funds and\nmembership are not. Recruiting, soliciting and proselytizing\nare similarly economic and functional and, at the same time,\nsimilarly expressive. Recruiting conveys the message that\n“our organization is worth working for,” while soliciting and\nproselytizing convey the similar functional message that “our\ncharity is worth giving to” or “our cause is worth joining.”\n\n      Having determined that recruiting is expressive, we\nnow turn to the law schools’ disagreement with that\nexpression.\n\n              (b)    The law schools’ disagreement with the\n                     speech of military recruiters.\n\n       Military recruiters visiting law school campuses\nundoubtedly speak to students about the benefits of a career in\nthe military, and the Solomon Amendment requires law\nschools to accept this speech. The law schools do not seem to\n\n                               39\n\ftake issue with most of the “expressions of value, opinion, or\nendorsement,” Hurley, 515 U.S. at 573, made by military\nrecruiters on campus (to the extent recruiters suggest that\nmilitary careers are honorable and rewarding experiences).\nNor, for the most part, do military recruiters describing\ncareers in the military make “statements of fact the [law\nschools] would rather avoid.” Id.\n\n        The law schools’ lack of objection to most of the\nspeech they are forced to accept within their fora raises a key\nquestion under the compelled speech doctrine: to what extent\nmust they disagree with the Government’s message in order\nfor strict scrutiny to apply?

Glickman involved a First\nAmendment challenge to regulations requiring fruit growers,\nhandlers, and processors to finance generic advertising of\nCalifornia nectarines, plums, and peaches. Id. at 460. The\nmajority “presume[d]” that the fruit growers, handlers, and\nprocessors “agree[d] with the central message of the speech\nthat is generated by the generic [government] program [at\nissue],” and stated that “compelled speech case law” was\n“inapplicable” because the scheme at issue did not, inter alia,\n“require them to use their own property to convey an\nantagonistic ideological message,” or “force them to respond\nto a hostile message when they would prefer to remain silent,”\nid. at 470–71 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)\n(emphases added). However, because the degree of\ndisagreement that may be required is minimal and in any\nevent is present in this case, we need not determine whether\nsuch a requirement exists nor, if so, decipher its precise\nbounds.\n\n                              42\n\f        As our dissenting colleague recently explained, the\n“individual’s disagreement [in a compelled speech case] can\nbe minor, as ‘[t]he general rule is that the speaker and the\naudience, not the government, assess the value of the\ninformation presented.’” Cochran v. Veneman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785208\"><a href=\"/opinion/785208/joseph-s-cochran-brenda-s-cochran-v-ann-veneman-secretary-us/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n275 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting United Foods, 533 U.S. at 411).\nIn Cochran, we held unconstitutional a law requiring dairy\nproducers to pay small assessments in support of “generic\nadvertising that promotes milk.” Id. Although the aggrieved\ndairy producers did not disapprove of the pro-milk message at\nissue, the ads featured milk “produced by methods they\nview[ed] as wasteful and harmful to the environment,” and\ndid not promote milk produced by their own favored methods.\nId. The ads, in effect, served to promote milk produced by\nefforts with which the plaintiff dairy producers disagreed.\n\n       Here the law schools similarly object to conveying the\nmessage that all employers are equal, and instead would\nrather only open their fora and use their resources to support\nemployers who, in their eyes, do not discriminate against\ngays. This objection constitutes as much of a protected First\nAmendment interest as the objection of the dairy farmers in\nCochran. Moreover, there is at least one important sense in\nwhich the law schools strenuously disagree with the very\nwords spoken by military recruiters that the Solomon\nAmendment compels them to accept and to which they have\nbeen forced to respond. 10 U.S.C. § 654(b) prohibits open,\npracticing gays from serving in the armed forces. Military\n\n                              43\n\frecruiters undisputedly are bound by § 654(b), and do not\nrecruit gay persons for service. Unsurprisingly, in light of\n§ 654(b), the record demonstrates that openly gay persons\nwho meet with military recruiters are told by the recruiters\nthat they may not pursue military careers.20 Such speech by\nmilitary recruiters is perhaps the most discordant speech the\nSolomon Amendment compels the law schools to accept.\nYet, as we have indicated, the act of being forced to accept\nspeech promoting an employer whose discriminatory policies\nthe law schools disagree with is sufficient “disagreement” to\nbring the Solomon Amendment within the Supreme Court’s\ncompelled speech jurisprudence.\n\n       Thus, unlike the regulatory scheme at issue in\nGlickman, the Solomon Amendment, by requiring law schools\nto open their fora to military recruiters when they would\nprefer to do so only for non-discriminating employers,\n“require[s] them to use their own property to convey an\nantagonistic ideological message.” Glickman, 521 U.S. at\n471. Likewise, by directly providing “access” to campuses\nfor speech by military recruiters where law students are told\nthat openly gay applicants may not serve, the Solomon\nAmendment requires the law schools to allow an\n\n\n 20\n    See JA107 (former ROTC student who had “wanted to be an\nofficer in the JAG Corps since high school” interviewed with\nmilitary recruiter, admitted his homosexuality, and was told that\nhe was “ineligible due to his sexual orientation”).\n\n                               44\n\fobjectionable message counter to their beliefs. In addition,\nboth forms of speech with which the law schools disagree\nhave resulted in, according to the record, hundreds (if not\nthousands) of instances of responsive speech by members of\nthe law school communities (administrators, faculty, and\nstudents), including various broadcast e-mails by law school\nadministrators to their communities, posters in protest of\nmilitary recruiter visits, and open fora held to “ameliorate” the\neffects of forced on-campus speech by military recruiters. All\nof these represent instances in which the schools were\n“force[d] . . . to respond to a hostile message when they\nwould prefer to remain silent.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Therefore, the degree of the law schools’\ndisagreement with the military recruiters’ expression is\nsufficient to warrant First Amendment protection. We now\ndetermine whether the Solomon Amendment compels the law\nschools to engage in that expression.\n\n              (c)    The law schools must propagate,\n                     accommodate, and subsidize the\n                     military’s expressive message.\n\n       Reasoning that the Solomon Amendment was not “an\noutright regulation on speech,” the District Court held that the\nSupreme Court’s compelled speech doctrine did not apply.\nFAIR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Put another way, the District\nCourt concluded that the statute does not “directly requir[e] a\nprivate speaker to participate in the dissemination of a\n\n                               45\n\fparticular message.” Id.\n\n       We disagree. Having concluded above that recruiting\nis expression, we believe that the Solomon Amendment\ncompels the law schools to engage in that expression in all\nthree proscribed ways: propagation, accommodation, and\nsubsidy. The statute insists not only on access to campus for\nmilitary recruiters, but the active and equal assistance of law\nschools’ career services offices. For example, Harvard Law\nSchool’s career services staff offers to assist employers to\n“get [their] message out to students in an effective manner.”\nLike many law schools, the assistance Harvard provides\nincludes coordinating interviews with students, counseling\nemployers on effective recruiting, stuffing students’\nmailboxes with employers’ information, scheduling social\nreceptions for students, and printing employers’\nannouncements in the School’s newsletter. Under the express\nterms of the Solomon Amendment, law schools like Harvard\nmust do the same for the military recruiters.\n\n        By requiring law schools to help military recruiters\n“get [their] message out to students” by distributing\nnewsletters and posting notices, the Solomon Amendment\ncompels law schools to propagate the military’s message.\nLike the forced display of an unwanted motto on one’s license\nplate, or the compulsory recitation of a pledge, this is\ncompelled speech. Wooley, 430 U.S. at 717; Barnette, 319\nU.S. at 642. By requiring schools to include military\n\n                              46\n\frecruiters in the interviews and recruiting receptions the\nschools arrange, the Solomon Amendment compels the\nschools to accommodate the military’s message in the\nrecruiting-assistance programs they provide for other\nemployers. Like the forced inclusion of a parade contingent,\na statement in the extra space of a utility’s billing statement,\nor a response in a newspaper’s editorial page, this is\ncompelled speech. See Hurley, 515 U.S. at 569–81; Pacific\nGas, 475 U.S. at 12–16; Miami Herald, 418 U.S. at 255–58.\nAnd by putting demands on the law schools’ employees and\nresources,21 the schools are compelled to subsidize the\nmilitary’s recruiting message. Like mandatory assessments to\nsupport advertisements or political funds, this is compelled\nspeech. See United Foods, 533 U.S. at 411–17; Abood, 431\nU.S. at 235.\n\n              (d)    The Solomon Amendment prohibits\n                     disclaimers and, even if it did not, risk of\n                     misattribution is not an element of a\n                     compelled speech violation.\n\n\n  21\n    While we recognize that the relative cost of providing these\nservices to one particular employer is marginal, the Supreme\nCourt has never required that compelled subsidies be substantial\nto present a constitutional concern. See, e.g., United Foods, 533\nU.S. at 408 (mushroom assessment at issue was one cent per\npound and only some of it was going toward the objectionable\nadvertising).\n\n                               47\n\f       The District Court suggested that assisting military\nrecruiters is not “obvious endorsement” by the law schools of\nthe military’s point of view because “law schools can\neffectively disclaim any recruiting message and can easily\ndistance themselves ideologically from the military\nrecruiters.” FAIR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 308, 310. But the\nSolomon Amendment, as recently amended, does not appear\nto permit law schools to disclaim the military’s message. Its\nexpress terms require them to provide treatment to the\nmilitary recruiters “equal in quality and scope” to that\nprovided to other employers. As the law schools do not\ndisclaim the messages of those employers, similarly they may\nnot disclaim the message of the military. Furthermore, it was\nin apparent response to the law schools’ ameliorative\nmeasures—their efforts to “distance themselves” (in the\nDistrict Court’s words) from the military’s position—that the\nDOD and eventually Congress insisted on equal treatment for\nmilitary recruiters.\n\n       But even if the Solomon Amendment allowed for\ndisclaimers, the Supreme Court has never held that compelled\nspeech concerns evaporate if a speaker can ameliorate the risk\nof misattribution by disclaiming the message it is being\ncompelled to propagate. To the contrary, “the presence of a\ndisclaimer . . . does not suffice to eliminate the impermissible\npressure . . . to respond to [compelled] speech.” Pacific Gas,\n475 U.S. at 15 n.11 (plurality opinion). While a disclaimer\nreduces the risk that readers will misattribute the message, it\n\n                               48\n\f“does nothing to reduce the risk that [the compelled speaker]\nwill be forced to respond when there is strong disagreement\nwith the substance of [the] message.” Id. Thus, in Pacific\nGas, the Supreme Court invalidated as compelled speech a\nrequirement that a utility share the extra space in its billing\nstatements with an organization that opposed its viewpoint.\nThe utility’s ability to include a disclaimer did not change the\nanalysis. In fact, a “forced reply” may add to the injury of\ncompelled speech, not its cure. Id. at 15–16 (noting that the\n“pressure to respond” to compelled speech is “antithetical to\nthe free discussion that the First Amendment seeks to foster”).\n\n        In Miami Herald, the Supreme Court also invalidated a\nstate law compelling newspapers to provide editorial page\nspace to any political candidates that the newspaper assailed\nin an editorial. 418 U.S. at 255–58. It did not suggest that a\nnewspaper could alleviate compelled speech by running a\ndisclaimer above the candidate’s message.22\n\n\n  22\n    While the newspapers could avoid triggering the penalty of\nhaving to provide editorial page space to assailed candidates by\nnot criticizing any candidates at all, the Court noted that this\nself-censorship was a form of speech suppression, itself a First\nAmendment injury. 418 U.S. at 257. Our case presents this\nself-censorship concern as well, as the law schools could avoid\ntriggering—or at least minimize—the quality and scope of\nactive assistance they must provide to military recruiters by\nlimiting the quality and scope of their assistance to other\n\n                              49\n\f       Similarly, in Wooley the Court held that the state motto\non the Maynards’ license plate was compelled speech even\nthough the state supreme court had expressly found in another\ncase that “nothing in the state law . . . precludes appellees\nfrom displaying their disagreement with the state motto as\nlong as the methods used do not obscure the license plates.”\n430 U.S. at 722 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (citing State v.\nHoskin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972)). 23 On the facts of Wooley,\n\n\nrecruiters.\n      23\n        The Supreme Court has expressed concerns about\nmisattribution and ability to disclaim in several of its compelled\nspeech cases.

Robins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1984) (suggesting that there\nwas no risk that the message of students distributing political\npamphlets and conducting a petition drive at a shopping mall\nwould be attributed incorrectly to the mall owner and noting that\nthe mall owner could disavow any connection with the message\nby posting signs near the petition table).\n       But in none of these cases did the Court hold that the risk\nof misattribution and the speaker’s ability to disclaim the\n\n                                50\n\fthere was virtually no risk that the compelled speech would be\nattributed to anyone other than the state.\n\n\n\n\nmessage were dispositive elements of the compelled speech\ndoctrine. In Hurley, the Court noted that it was not “deciding on\nthe precise significance of the likelihood of misattribution” and\ndid not rest its holding on the parade organizer’s presumed\ndifficulty in disclaiming the gay marchers’ message. 515 U.S.\nat 517. And in both PruneYard and TBS the absence of a risk of\nmisattribution was only one of a number of factors\ndistinguishing them from prior cases in which compelled speech\nhad been found. PruneYard, 447 U.S. at 87; TBS, 512 U.S. at\n654–55. The Court also considered the content-neutral nature\nof the law causing the challenged “compelled” speech, the\nnonexistent risk of self-censorship, and the unique\ncharacteristics of the forum (the Court later described the\nshopping mall in PruneYard as a “peculiarly public” forum, see\nPacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 13 n.8; the TBS Court noted cable’s\nmonopoly status and exclusive control over the “essential\npathway” for disseminating a particular type of communication).\nTBS, 512 U.S. at 654–56; PruneYard, 447 U.S. at 87–88. And\nwhile PruneYard comes closest to holding that a speaker’s\nability to disclaim a message may be relevant to the compelled\nspeech analysis, it is notable that PruneYard predated Pacific\nGas, the most express rejection of the ability to disclaim as an\nantidote for compelled speech. Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 15 n.11\n(plurality opinion) (“The presence of a disclaimer . . . does not\nsuffice to eliminate the impermissible pressure on the appellant\nto respond to [the unwanted] speech . . . .”).\n\n                               51\n\f        In sum, law schools are expressly precluded from\ndisclaiming or retorting the military’s recruiting message by\nthe Solomon Amendment’s new requirement that their\ntreatment of military recruiters be “equal in quality and\nscope” to the treatment of other recruiters. And while the\nCourt has mentioned the danger of misattribution and the\nspeaker’s ability to disclaim in several of its compelled speech\ncases, it has not held to date that the presence of either factor\neliminated compelled speech concerns. Therefore, the\nDistrict Court was wrong to reject FAIR’s compelled speech\nclaims on the basis of its conclusion that the Solomon\nAmendment’s requirements posed little risk of misattribution\nto the law schools who in any event could effectively disclaim\nthe military’s message.\n\n              (e)     The Solomon Amendment would not\n                      likely survive strict scrutiny.\n\n        Although the Solomon Amendment impairs the law\nschools’ First Amendment rights by compelling them to\npropagate, accommodate, and subsidize the military’s\nrecruiting message against their will, the statute “could still be\nvalid if it were a narrowly tailored means of serving a\ncompelling state interest”—i.e., if it passed strict First\nAmendment scrutiny. Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 19; see also\nRiley, 487 U.S. at 798 (regulation impairing speakers’ First\nAmendment rights under the compelled speech doctrine was\nsubject to “exacting First Amendment scrutiny” that it did not\n\n                               52\n\fsurvive). We thus inquire (1) whether the Government’s\ninterest in recruiting military lawyers is compelling, and (2)\nwhether the Solomon Amendment is narrowly tailored to\nadvance that goal. But as discussed above in the context of\nFAIR’s expressive association claim, see supra Part\nIII.B.1(c), the Solomon Amendment does not survive strict\nscrutiny because the Government has not demonstrated (or\neven argued) that it cannot recruit effectively by less speech-\nrestrictive means. Therefore, the balance of interests likely\ntips in the law schools’ favor.\n\n                *      *       *       *       *\n\n       To summarize, the Solomon Amendment conditions\nfunding on the law schools’ propagation, accommodation, and\nsubsidy of the military’s recruiting, which is expression. The\nGovernment has not shown that the assistance from law\nschools that the Solomon Amendment requires is narrowly\ntailored to advance its interest in recruiting. FAIR has thus\nestablished a reasonable likelihood of establishing that the\nSolomon Amendment unconstitutionally conditions funding\non a basis that infringes law schools’ constitutionally\nprotected interests under the First Amendment doctrine of\ncompelled speech.\n\n       3.     Consideration of O’Brien\n\n       We turn finally to an argument that is ancillary to our\n\n                               53\n\fholding. Although the Solomon Amendment fits within the\ncategories of First Amendment cases described in the\nprevious sections, the District Court placed it instead into a\nmold it does not fit: the doctrine of expressive conduct. In so\ndoing, it applied the intermediate scrutiny test set out by the\nSupreme Court in United States v. O’Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107701\"><a href=\"/opinion/107701/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1968), discussed at length below, for review of governmental\nregulations with only an incidental effect on expression. For\nthe sake of completeness, we close by considering whether\nthe law schools’ resistance to the military’s recruitment\npolicy, motivated by their ideological opposition to exclusion\nbased on sexual orientation, is expressive conduct protected\nby the First Amendment. 24\n\n              (a)    O’Brien is inapplicable when First\n\n\n  24\n    While the expressive content of the law schools’ message is\nrelevant also to the law schools’ expressive association claim\nunder Dale, the analysis is different in that context. Under the\nrubric of expressive association, we consider whether the\nSolomon Amendment interferes with the law schools’ extant\nmessage of nondiscrimination, and thus impinges their\nassociational freedom, by compelling them to assist in the\nmilitary’s recruitment efforts. But with expressive conduct we\nask whether resistance to the statute, i.e., exclusion of the\nrecruiters in contravention of the statute (or its flip side, “the\nconduct of law schools in permitting or assisting a recruiting\nactivity,” FAIR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 309), is itself expressive\nconduct warranting First Amendment protection.\n\n                               54\n\f                     Amendment activity is protected on other\n                     grounds.\n\n        Before exploring the contours of the O’Brien test, we\nexplain briefly why expressive conduct fails as a descriptive\nmodel of the First Amendment issues at stake in this case.\nActivity simultaneously may give rise to an expressive\nconduct claim and to claims based on alternative theories.\nThe premise of the category “expressive conduct” is that some\nactivity, though it is not speech proper and is not protected\nunder other First Amendment grounds, is crucial to public\ndebate and warrants protection. See Texas v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112304\"><a href=\"/opinion/112304/texas-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (1989) (explaining that the Court has “long\nrecognized that [the First Amendment’s] protection does not\nend at the spoken or written word” and that conduct may be\n“sufficiently imbued with elements of communication” to\nmerit First Amendment protection) (citations omitted).\nExpressive conduct is, loosely stated, an overflow category; it\nis broad.25 It is therefore unsurprising that much expression\n\n\n  25\n    As noted in Johnson, id., the Supreme Court has recognized\nthe expressive nature of students' wearing of black armbands to\nprotest the war in Vietnam, Tinker v.

In those\ncases, application of the O’Brien test is inappropriate.\n\n        We need only look at the seminal expressive\nassociation and compelled speech cases to see that this is so.\nIn Dale, for example, the Supreme Court expressly declined\nto rely on O’Brien, explaining: “New Jersey’s public\naccommodations law directly and immediately affects\nassociational rights, in this case associational rights that enjoy\nFirst Amendment protection. Thus, O’Brien is inapplicable.”\n530 U.S. at 659. Likewise in Wooley v. Maynard, the\nSupreme Court elected not to consider O’Brien because it\nconsidered compelled speech to be a “more appropriate First\nAmendment ground[].” 430 U.S. at 713. In short, the Court\nhas not applied O’Brien where alternative First Amendment\ngrounds were available.\n\n       Taking our cue from the Supreme Court, because the\nSolomon Amendment is subject to strict scrutiny under the\ndoctrines of expressive association and compelled speech, we\nneed not engage in an O’Brien analysis. Because O’Brien\nscrutiny is intermediate rather than strict, demonstrating a\nconstitutional violation under a theory of expressive conduct\n\n\n(1970); and of picketing in support of a wide variety of causes,\nsee, e.g., Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107692\"><a href=\"/opinion/107692/food-employees-v-logan-valley-plaza-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313-314 (1968).\n\n                                56\n\fis significantly more burdensome than under the models we\nhave discussed. And the law schools need establish only one\nconstitutional infirmity to justify an injunction. See, e.g., Sys.\nOperations, Inc. v. Scientific Games Dev. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"345587\"><a href=\"/opinion/345587/system-operations-inc-a-delaware-corporation-and-mathematica-inc-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1144 (3d Cir. 1977).\n\n              (b)     Even under O’Brien, the Solomon\n                      Amendment is likely to impair expressive\n                      conduct unconstitutionally.\n\n        Even if O’Brien applied, we would reverse the District\nCourt’s decision because we disagree with its application of\nintermediate scrutiny. Notwithstanding that the District\nCourt’s opinion featured a consistent theme—that the\nSolomon Amendment “targets conduct, not speech”—the\nCourt acknowledged a communicative or expressive element\nin the law schools’ policies against offering the schools’\nresources, support, or endorsement to any employer who does\nnot conform to their antidiscrimination policies.

Thus, to the extent we focus on the law\nschools’ conduct, it is nonetheless expressive.\n\n        The First Amendment protects the right to engage in\nexpressive conduct. See, e.g., NAACP v.

We assume arguendo\nthat the District Court was correct in determining that the\nSolomon Amendment is unrelated to the suppression of ideas.\nId. at 314. And we of course presume that the United States\nhas a vital interest in having a system for acquiring talented\nmilitary lawyers. But as we noted above, the Government\nhas chosen to submit no evidence that would support the\nnecessity of requiring law schools to provide the military with\na forum for, and assistance in, recruiting. Instead, the\nGovernment argues that “the impact of the wholesale\nexclusion of military recruiters [from law school campuses] is\nself-evident, and the government is not obligated” during\n\n                               58\n\fpreliminary injunction proceedings “to assemble and present a\nfactual record that merely confirms the dictates of common\nsense.” The Government fails to offer even an affidavit\nindicating that enforcement of the Solomon Amendment has\nenhanced military recruiting efforts. It suggests simply that\nthe scope of the remedy sought by the plaintiffs relieves the\nGovernment of its obligation, pursuant to the First\nAmendment, to justify its curtailment of expression. How this\nis so we cannot conjure. We are unaware of any case so\nholding.26 And while the Government emphasizes that the\nNation’s military is at stake, invoking the importance of a\nwell-trained military is not a substitute for demonstrating that\nthere is an important governmental interest in opening the law\nschools to military recruiting.

As for the\nfinal element, we believe the public is best served by\nenjoining a statute that unconstitutionally impairs First\nAmendment rights.\n\n                       IV.   Conclusion\n\n        The Solomon Amendment requires law schools to\nexpress a message that is incompatible with their educational\nobjectives, and no compelling governmental interest has been\nshown to deny this freedom. While no doubt military lawyers\nare critical to the efficient operation of the armed forces, mere\nincantation of the need for legal talent cannot override a clear\nFirst Amendment impairment. Even were the test less\nrigorous than a compelling governmental riposte to the\nschools’ rights under the First Amendment, failure\nnonetheless is foreordained at this stage, for the military fails\nto provide any evidence that its restrictions on speech are no\nmore than required to further its interest in attracting good\nlegal counsel.\n\n        In this context, the Solomon Amendment cannot\ncondition federal funding on law schools’ compliance with it.\nFAIR has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits and\nsatisfies the other injunctive elements as well. We reverse\nand remand for the District Court to enter a preliminary\ninjunction against enforcement of the Solomon Amendment.\n\n                               62\n\fFAIR et al. v. Rumsfeld et al., No. 03-4433\n\nALDISERT, Circuit Judge, Dissenting.\n\n\n\n\n       I would affirm the judgment of the district court.\nAlthough I have myriad problems with the fundamental\ncontentions presented by the Appellants and the host of\nsupporting amicus curiae briefs, essentially my disagreement\nis with the all-pervasive approach that this is a case of First\nAmendment protection in the nude. It is not.\n\n       Rather, the issues before us are threefold. First, we\nmust inquire whether Appellants have met the high burden of\novercoming the presumption of constitutionality of a\ncongressional statute that is not only bottomed on the\nSpending Clause, but on a number of other specific provisions\nin the Constitution that deal with Congress’ obligation to\nsupport the military. This is especially relevant because, in the\nentire history of the United States, no court heretofore has\never declared unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds\nany congressional statute specifically designed to support the\nmilitary.\n\n       Second, we must determine, using canons of logic,\n\n                               63\n\fwhether a permissible factual inference—let alone a\ncompellable one—may be properly drawn that the law\nschools’ anti-discrimination policies are violated from the\nsole evidentiary datum that a military recruiter appears on\ncampus for a short time.\n\n        Third, only if a proper inference may be drawn do we\nmeet First Amendment considerations. The First Amendment\nis implicated if and only if, after applying the “balance-of-\ninterests” test originally articulated by Justice Brennan in\nRoberts v. United States Jaycees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), it can\nbe concluded that the operation of the First Amendment\ntrumps the several clauses of Articles I and II relating to the\nspending power and support of the military.\n\n       Upon analysis, the argument of the Appellants and\nmany of the amici curiae, including but not limited to the\nAssociation of American Law Schools, is rather complex. Its\npoint of beginning takes the following tripartite form: (1)\nmost, but not all, accredited American law schools have\nadopted policies that indicate they will not discriminate based\non age, race, color, national origin, disability, religion, gender\nor sexual orientation; (2) the law schools have committed\nthemselves to “admit students, grant scholarships, grade\nexams, recruit and promote faculty, and hire staff in light of\nthese principles” (J.A. at 509); (3) in conjunction with their\nown commitment not to discriminate, the law schools have\nadopted policies stating that they will not assist employers\n\n                                64\n\fwho discriminate.\n\n       Their intermediate statement is that the United States\nmilitary excludes service members based on evidence of\nhomosexual conduct or orientation. See 10 U.S.C. § 654\n(2004). From this, the law schools conclude that permitting\nthe military to recruit on campus for military lawyers and\nmilitary judges creates a compellable inference that the law\nschools are violating their own policies prohibiting\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\n        They then move to the Solomon Amendment which\nprovides that certain federal grants will not be made to “an\ninstitution of higher education ... if the Secretary of Defense\ndetermines that that institution ... has a policy or practice ..\nthat either prohibits, or in effect prevents – (1) the Secretary\nof a military department or [the Department of Homeland\nSecurity] from gaining entry to campuses, or access to\nstudents (who are 17 years of age or older) on campuses, for\npurposes of military recruiting . . .” 28 10 U.S.C. § 983.\n\n\n  28\n    Congress has clarified that the funding restriction does not\napply to the following: (1) federal grants of funds “to be\navailable solely for student financial assistance or related\nadministrative costs,” Pub. L. No. 106-79, § 8120, 113 Stat.\n1260 (Oct. 25, 1999); (2) an institution that ceased its prior\npolicy or practice of prohibiting or effectively preventing entry\nto campus or access to students on campus for military\n\n                               65\n\f        This year, Congress amended the Solomon\nAmendment to require military recruiting access “in a manner\nthat is at least equal in quality and scope to the [degree of]\naccess to campuses and to students that is provided to any\nother employer.” National Defense Authorization Bill for\nFiscal Year 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-287 (2004).\n\n        From the foregoing premises Appellants’ Second\nAmended Complaint alleges that the Solomon Amendment\nand regulations promulgated thereunder violate the First\nAmendment as applied to law schools by: (1) imposing\nunconstitutional conditions on the receipt of federal funding;\n(2) effecting viewpoint discrimination; (3) forcing the\nplaintiffs to endorse messages repugnant to them and\nsuppressing their expression of dissent; and (4) imposing\nvague and overbroad restrictions on speech.\n\n       I would hold that Congress’ use of the spending power\nand fulfillment of the requirements to maintain the military\nunder Articles I and II do not unreasonably burden speech\nand, therefore, do not offend the First Amendment. I apply the\nbalance-of-interests test and decide that the interest of\nprotecting the national security of the United States outweighs\n\n\nrecruiting, 10 U.S.C. § 983(c)(1); and (3) an institution that “has\na longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical religious\naffiliation,” 10 U.S.C. § 983(c)(2).\n\n\n                                66\n\fthe indirect and attenuated interest in the law schools’ speech,\nexpressive association and academic freedom rights. The\nSolomon Amendment survives the constitutional attack\nbecause its provisions, the 2004 amendments thereto and\nrelated regulations, govern conduct while only incidentally\naffecting speech. In serving its compelling interest in\nrecruiting military lawyers, the statute does not require the\ngovernment to engage in unconstitutional conduct.\nAccordingly, with respect, I dissent. I agree with the\nthoughtful statement of reasons of the district court and would\naffirm its judgment.\n\n                               I.\n\n       The starting point for analysis must be fealty to the\nprecept that congressional statutes are presumed to be\nconstitutional.

By reversing the\ndistrict court’s judgment, the majority has created new law,\ntotally unsupported by binding precedent. In doing so the\nmajority selects analogues to cases where state public\naccommodation statutes were involved and not a single case\nwhere an act of Congress was not only authorized by various\nClauses in Articles I and II, but commanded by them.\n\n         In the posture of this case, Appellants do not urge that\nthe Solomon Amendment is facially unconstitutional, but only\nthat it is unconstitutional as applied to the law schools\nbecause it offends their stated policies of anti-discrimination.\nTo succeed in their burden of overcoming the presumption of\nconstitutionality of the Solomon Amendment, they must first\ndemonstrate that the mere presence of recruiting officers on\ncampus constitutes a compellable inference that the law\nschools will be objectively and reasonably viewed as violating\ntheir anti-discrimination policies. If they succeed at that stage,\nthen they must demonstrate that the bite of the First\nAmendment under the facts of this case is so strong as to\noutweigh Congress’ interests to “provide for the common\nDefense . . .,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.; “declare War,\ngrant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules\n\n                               71\n\fconcerning Captures on Land and Water,” id. cl. 11; “raise\nand support Armies, id. cl. 12; “provide and maintain a\nNavy,” id. cl. 13; “make Rules for the Government and\nRegulation of the land and naval Forces,” id. cl. 14; and for\nthe President to “be Commander in Chief of the Army and\nNavy of the United States. . . .,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 1;\nand to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed . . .,”\nid. § 3, cl. 1.\n\n       Before proceeding into this analysis, it bears note that\nthe military’s policy against homosexual activity, codified at\n10 U.S.C. § 654, previously has been adjudged by a number\nof our sister courts of appeals not to violate the Constitution.\nSee, e.g., Richenberg v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (8th Cir.\n1996) (“We join six other circuits in concluding that the\nmilitary may exclude those who engage in homosexual acts as\ndefined in [10 U.S.C.] § 654(f)(3)(A).”).\n\n        Moreover, in United States v. City of Phil., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474561\"><a href=\"/opinion/474561/united-states-v-the-city-of-philadelphia-the-philadelphia-commission-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1986) this court has discussed the very subject of\nthis appeal. In that case, the Temple School of Law’s\nplacement office invited the Judge Advocate General Corps\nof the Army, Navy and Marine Corps to participate in a job\nrecruiting program on its campus. he Philadelphia\nCommission on Human Relations issued an order restraining\nthe law school from doing so on the ground that the military\nservices did not accept homosexuals. We affirmed a district\ncourt order prohibiting the Commission from taking any\n\n                                 72\n\fadverse action. After reviewing Congressional legislation\nimplementing what we described as “the long standing\nCongressional policy of encouraging colleges and universities\nto cooperate with, and open their campuses to, military\nrecruiters,” we stated:\n\nWe believe that only one reasonable conclusion can be drawn\nfrom this legislation: Congress considers access to college and\nuniversity employment facilities by military recruiters to be a\nmatter of paramount importance. In other words, we think that\nCongress views such access an integral part of the military’s\neffort to conduct “intensive recruiting campaigns to obtain\nenlistments.” This conclusion is buttressed by the legislative\nhistory of these provisions. For example, a committee report\naccompanying the DDA Act of 1973 states, in pertinent part,\nthat “the Committee believes that [the] national interest is best\nserved by colleges and universities which provide for the full\nspectrum of opportunity for various career fields, including\nthe military field through the Reserve Officers Training Corps\nprogram, and by the opportunity for students to talk to all\nrecruiting sources, including military recruiters.” H.R.Rep No.\n92-1149, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 79 (1972). . . .\n\n       We conclude, therefore, that the Order conflicts with a\nclearly discernible Congressional policy concerning military\nrecruitment on the campuses of this nation’s colleges and\nuniversities.\n\n\n\n                               73\n\fId. at 86, 88. We do not write on a clean slate regarding the\nimportance Congress places in access to college and\nuniversity facilities by the military. We already have decided\nthat issue contrary to the argument pressed by the Appellants.\nAnd we made this determination almost twenty years ago.\n\n                              III.\n\n        Before we address the application of First Amendment\nprecepts, I am unwilling to accept that there is a permissible\ninference, let alone a compellable one, that a military presence\non campus to recruit, in and of itself, conjures up an\nimmediate impression of a discriminatory institution.\nThroughout our history, especially in times of war, like the\npresent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the military\ncampaign against the Al Qaeda, a completely different\nimpression is evoked. The men and women in uniform are\nalmost universally considered as heroes, sacrificing not only\ntheir lives and well-being, but living separate from all the\ncomforts of stateside living. Again in the current era, almost\nevery day, a candidate for President emphasized his four\nmonths as a swift boat commander in the Vietnam conflict.\nAs masters of public opinion, the political apparatus on both\nsides of the aisle certainly would not put a premium on\nmilitary service if the inference of the discrimination\nadvanced by Appellants here was attached thereto. Indeed, the\nrespect to the man and woman in uniform is so profound that\nin the same Presidential campaign, the other candidate was\n\n                              74\n\fcriticized for serving at home in a National Guard unit during\nthe Vietnam conflict instead of going overseas.\n\n        This view of service in the armed forces is at the\nfarthest polar extreme from the Appellants’ position that the\nmere presence of military recruiters conjures up the image of\nan institution that discriminates. That the military does so in\nfact, does not, in and of itself, generate the direct and\nuniversal feeling of loathing and abomination to the extent\nthat their presence on campus a few days a year deprives law\nschool institutions of rights inferred from the First\nAmendment.\n\n       What is involved here in the first instance is not\noperation of legal principles but precepts of logic that\ndetermine what can be properly inferred from stated\ncircumstances. An inference is a process in which one\nproposition (a factual conclusion) is arrived at and affirmed\non the basis of one or more other propositions, which were\naccepted as the starting point of the process. Professor\nStebbing observes that an inference “may be defined as a\nmental process in which a thinker passes from the\napprehension of something given, the datum, to something,\nthe conclusion, related in a certain way to the datum, and\naccepted only because the datum has been accepted.” L.S.\nStebbing, A M odern Introduction to Logic 211-212 (1948).\n\n       Inference is a process where the thinker passes from\n\n                               75\n\fone proposition to another that is connected with the former in\nsome way. But for the passage to be valid, it must be made\naccording to the laws of logic that permit a reasonable\nmovement from one proposition to another. Inference, then is\n“any passing from knowledge to new knowledge.” Joseph\nGerard Brennan, A Handbook of Logic 1 (1957). The passage\ncannot be mere speculation, intuition or guessing. The key to\na logical inference is the reasonable probability that the\nconclusion flows from the evidentiary datum because of past\nexperiences in human affairs. A moment is necessary to\ndiscuss the difference between inference and implication.\nThese terms are obverse sides of the same coin. We infer a\nconclusion from the data; the data imply a conclusion.\nProfessor Cooley explains:\n\n        [w]hen a series of statements is an instance of a valid\nform of inference, the conclusion will be said to follow from\nthe premises, and the premises to imply the conclusion. If a\nset of premises implies a conclusion, then, whenever the\npremises are accepted as true, the conclusion must be\naccepted as true also . . . .\n\nJohn C. Cooley, A Primer of Formal Logic 13 (1942).\n\n       As Professor Brennan put it: “In ordinary discourse,\n[implication] may mean ‘to give a hint,’ and [inference], ‘to\ntake a hint.’” Brennan, A Handbook of Logic at 2-3. Drawing\na proper inference is critical in this case, and this court has\n\n                               76\n\fheretofore suggested some broad guidelines:\n\n      The line between a reasonable inference that\n      may permissibly be drawn by a jury from basic\n      facts in evidence and an impermissible\n      speculation is not drawn by judicial\n      idiosyncracies. The line is drawn by the laws of\n      logic. If there is an experience of logical\n      probability that an ultimate fact will follow a\n      stated narrative or historical fact, then the jury is\n      given the opportunity to draw a conclusion\n      because there is a reasonable probability that the\n      conclusion flows from the proven facts. As the\n      Supreme Court has stated, “The essential\n      requirement is that mere speculation be not\n      allowed to do duty for probative facts after\n      making due allowance for all reasonably\n      possible inferences favoring the party whose\n      case is attacked.”\n\n\n\n\nTose v.

It bears repetition that the\npassage from datum to conclusion cannot be mere\nspeculation, intuition, or guessing, or by “judicial\nidiosyncracies.” The subjective idiosyncratic impressions of\nsome law students, some professors, or some anti-war\nprotesters are not the test. What we know as men and women\nwe cannot forget as judges.

Aldisert,\nThe Judicial Process: Text, Materials and Cases 489 (2d ed.\n1996) (citing authorities). Two important interests conflict\nhere. Using the formulation of Dean Roscoe Pound, they are:\n(1) “an interest in general safety, long recognized in the legal\norder in the maxim that the safety of the people is the highest\nlaw;” and (2) the social interest in political progress and\nindividual mental self-assertion, taking form in “the [p]olicy\nin favor of free speech and free belief and opinion[.]” Roscoe\nPound, “A Survey of Social Interests,” 57 Harv. L.

It must be emphasized that even bare\nphysical access is more than the Appellants are willing to\ntolerate; they are asserting a constitutional right to exclude the\nmilitary from campuses altogether. Second, it is hardly\ncredible for the Appellants to suggest that physical access\nalone is sufficient for effective military recruiting, particularly\nwhen other employers are being granted far more extensive\nand meaningful access. It is fair to assume that all of the\nfacilities and services provided to prospective employers by\nlaw schools are intended to facilitate the hiring process. If\nmilitary recruiters are denied the ability to reach students on\nthe same terms as other employers, damage to military\nrecruiting is not simply probable but inevitable. The Solomon\nAmendment reflects Congress’ judgment about the\nrequirements of military recruiting, and “[t]he validity of such\nregulations does not turn on a judge’s agreement with the\n\n                                83\n\fresponsible decision maker concerning the most appropriate\nmethod for promoting significant government interests.”\nUnited States v.

They make\nit perfectly clear that they are not opposed to military\ninstitutions as such; they only want to curtail recruitment of\nmilitary lawyers and judges. It is important for private\nemployers to appear on campus to recruit law school\ngraduates for positions with law school-sponsored “On\nCampus Recruiting Days” or “On Campus Interviewing”\nreplete with interviews, followed by dinners and parties, but\nsomehow the military will recruit its lawyers without\nappearing on campus. Somehow, Appellants urge, better law\ngraduates will be attracted to the military legal branches with\nits lower pay and fewer benefits by some other recruiting\nmethod, for example, from the ranks of undergraduate ROTC\nprograms. 29 Much of Appellants’ brief takes the form of\n\n\n  29\n       The following colloquy took place at the oral argument:\n\nTHE COURT: What else could the government do as a less\nrestrictive alternative?\n\n                                84\n\fconclusory statements that the military is able to attract top of\nthe line or high quality students without stepping foot on\ncampus. There is no explanation, however, why the law\nschools consider it important to have private national law\nfirms come to campus and boast about first year associates’\nsalaries and signing bonuses and emphasize that if the\nstudents want to clerk for a federal judge for a year, the firm\nwill add another bonus. This is not only OK for the private\nsector, but also it’s good for the law school. But we don’t\nwant military recruiters to pollute our students. No, say the\nlaw schools, what’s sauce for the private sector goose is not\nsauce for the military gander. No, say the law schools, we\ndon’t need a level playing field; let the military shift for\nthemselves.\n\n       In its demand for total exclusion of military recruiters\nfrom their campuses, “fair play” is not a phrase in the law\nschools’ lexicon. They obviously do not desire that our men\nand women in the armed services, all members of a closed\nsociety, obtain optimum justice in military courts with the\nbest-trained lawyers and judges. It scarcely can be an\nexaggeration to suggest that in many respects the need for\n\n\nMR. ROSENKRANTZ: [A]ny number of things.

In making this argument, the Appellants\nplace principal reliance on the teachings of Hurley v. Irish-\nAmerican Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston. The\ndistrict court recognized, however, that nothing in Hurley\nsuggests that the Solomon Amendment crosses the line into\nunconstitutionality. I agree completely and accept the\ngovernment’s analysis of this issue.\n\n                              A.\n\n       In Hurley, the Court held that a state public\naccommodation law could not constitutionally be applied to\ncompel organizers of a St. Patrick’s Day parade to allow a\ngroup of gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals to march in the\nparade for the purpose of conveying a public message about\nhomosexual pride and solidarity. 515 U.S. at 572-581. The\norganizers did not object to the participation of the group’s\nmembers in the parade; the only question was whether the\n\n                              86\n\fgroup could participate in the parade “as its own parade unit\ncarrying its own banner.” Id. at 572. The Court concluded that\nthe law’s “apparent object is simply to require speakers to\nmodify the content of their expression to whatever extent\nbeneficiaries of the law choose to alter it with messages of\ntheir own,” and that in so doing, the law “violates the\nfundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment[]\nthat a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his\nown message.” Id. at 573, 578.\n\n        Hurley involved an effort by the government to dictate\nthe content of a quintessential form of expressive activity—a\npublic parade. The Court emphasized that parades “are . . . a\nform of expression, not just motion,” and “the inherent\nexpressiveness of marching to make a point,” id. at 568,\nformed the predicate for its opinion. In contrast, there is\nnothing remotely so expressive about the activity of\nrecruiting. The military engages in recruiting on college\ncampuses for precisely the same reason as do other\nemployers: to hire employees. Recruiting is undertaken solely\nfor instrumental reasons, not expressive ones.\n\n        To be sure, recruiting involves speaking, but the\nrecruiter speaks purely as part of an economic transaction, and\nthe expression is entirely subordinate to the transaction itself.\nIt bears no resemblance to the activities of the would-be\nmarchers in Hurley, who formed their group “for the very\npurpose of marching” in the parade, and who sought to march\n\n                               87\n\f“as a way to express pride in their Irish heritage as openly\ngay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to demonstrate that\nthere are such men and women among those so descended,\nand to express their solidarity with like individuals who\nsought to march in New York’s St. Patrick’s Day parade.” Id.\nat 560, 570. In Hurley, unlike here, expression was not a\nsubsidiary part of an instrumental activity; expression was the\nactivity.\n\n       The role of the parade organizers in Hurley consisted\nof choosing the messages that would comprise the parade, and\nthe vice of the challenged statute was that the homosexual\ngroup’s protest message would be attributed to the organizers\nthemselves. The Court reasoned that the group’s participation\nin the parade “would likely be perceived as having resulted\nfrom the Council’s customary determination about a unit\nadmitted to the parade, that its message was worthy of\npresentation and quite possibly of support as well.” Id. at 575.\n\n       Here, in contrast, the likelihood that members of a law\nschool community will perceive a military recruiter’s on-\ncampus activities as reflecting the school’s “customary\ndetermination” that the recruiter’s message is “worthy of\npresentation and quite possibly of support” is vanishingly\nsmall. Unlike bystanders watching a passing parade, law\nschool students, and to be sure, their professors, are an\nextraordinarily sophisticated and well-informed group, who\nunderstand perfectly well that their schools admit military\n\n                              88\n\frecruiters not because they endorse any “message” that may\nbe conveyed by the recruiters’ brief and transitory appearance\non campus, but because the economic consequences of the\nSolomon Amendment have induced them to do so. The\nlikelihood that the military’s recruiting will be seen as part of\na law school’s own message is particularly small when\nschools can take— and have taken— ameliorative steps to\npublicize their continuing disagreement with the military’s\npolicies and the reasons for their acquiescence in military\nrecruiting.\n\n        There is nothing to prevent the law school\ncommunities from making speeches discouraging military\nrecruiting, posting signs and erecting huge billboards on\ncampus or public approaches announcing their opposition and\nstating their reasons. That this is an important consideration\nhas been emphasized by the Supreme Court in PruneYard\nShopping Ctr. v. Robbins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980):\n\n       [f]inally, as far as appears here appellants can\n       expressly disavow any connection with the\n       message by simply posting signs in the area\n       where the speakers or handbillers stand. Such\n       signs, for example, could disclaim any\n       sponsorship of the message and could explain\n       that the persons are communicating their own\n       messages by virtue of state law.\n\n\n\n                               89\n\fId. at 87.\n\n      Clearly, the interests expressed in Hurley lack the\npower to dilute the judiciary’s traditional deference to\nCongress in the interest of national defense.\n\n       In addition to arguing that the Solomon Amendment\ntrenches on freedom of speech simpliciter, the Appellants also\ncontend that the statute infringes on the law schools’ interests\nin expressive association.

Here, in contrast, the recruiting\n\n                               91\n\factivities of military recruiters are paid for exclusively with\nfederal tax revenues; the Solomon Amendment does not\nobligate educational institutions to pay one red cent to the\ngovernment or to a private organization. Although Appellants\ncomplain of having to provide \"scarce interview space\" and\n\"make appointments,\" (Appellant br. at 31), this kind of\nphysical accommodation simply does not present the\nconstitutional concern underlying cases like Abood ,\nGlickman, United Foods and Cochran—the concern that\ncompelling an individual to pay for someone else's speech\nimpinges on his right to \"believe as he will\" and to have his\nbeliefs \"shaped by his mind and his conscience rather than\ncoerced by the State.\" Abood, 431 U.S. at 235.\n\n       Unlike Abood, this case does not involve the right to\nmake or not make “contributions for political purposes.” 431\nU.S. at 234. Unlike Glickman, there was no mandatory\nassessments similar to those to be paid by growers of\nnectarines, plums and peaches under regulations 7 C.F.R.\nsections 916.31©), 917.35(f) promulgated under the\nAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act, 7 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.\nUnlike United Foods, there were no mandatory assessments\nsimilar to those imposed on mushroom producers for the\npurpose of funding generic mushroom advertisements under\nthe Mushroom Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6101.

Unlike a regulatory scheme\nrequiring subsidization of generic advertising for fruit,\nmushrooms or milk, the Solomon Amendment “impose[s] no\nrestraint on the freedom of any [law school] to communicate\nany message to any audience . . . do[es] not compel any\nperson to engage in any actual or symbolic speech . . .

Because a successful analogy is\ndrawn by demonstrating the resemblances or similarities in\nthe facts, the degree of similarity is always the crucial\nelement. You cannot conclude that only a partial resemblance\nbetween two entities is equal to a substantial or exact\ncorrespondence.\n\n\n\n\nId. at 147.\n\n                              VI.\n\n       In challenging the district court’s reasoning,\nAppellants also seek to analogize this case to the teachings of\nDale. As the district court recognized, (J.A. 68-70), a\ncomparison of this case to Dale shows not why the Appellants\nshould prevail in this case, as urged by the majority, but why\nthey must lose, see id. at 648-650.\n\n       In Dale, the Court was presented with a New Jersey\n\n                               95\n\fpublic accommodations law that compelled the Boy Scouts of\nAmerica (“BSA”) to admit “an avowed homosexual and gay\nrights activist,” id. at 644, as an adult member and\nscoutmaster. The declared mission of the BSA was to “instill\nvalues in young people,” id. at 649, and disapproval of\nhomosexual conduct was one of BSA’s values. BSA relied on\nits scoutmasters to “inculcate [Boy Scouts] with the Boy\nScouts’ values—both expressly and by example.” Id. at 650.\nThe Court reasoned that “[t]he forced inclusion of an\nunwanted person in a group infringes the group’s freedom of\nexpressive association if the presence of that person affects in\na significant way the group’s ability to advocate public or\nprivate viewpoints.” Id. at 648. The Court found that “the\npresence of Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would surely\ninterfere with the Boy Scouts’ choice not to propound a point\nof view contrary to its beliefs,” because it would “force the\norganization to send a message, both to the youth members\nand the world, that the Boy Scouts accept[] homosexual\nconduct as a legitimate form of behavior.” Id. at 653-654.\n\n        Let me now count the two ways the Solomon\nAmendment differs from the state statute in Dale, both of\nwhich are critical to the law’s impact vel non on associational\ninterests. First, the Solomon Amendment simply does not\nimpinge on the right of educational institutions to determine\ntheir membership. See 10 U.S.C. § 983. It does not purport to\ntell colleges and universities whom to admit as students or\nwhom to hire as professors or administrators. It merely\n\n                               96\n\frequires them to allow the transient presence of recruiters,\nwho are not a part of the law school and do not become\nmembers through their mere presence. In contrast to the\nscoutmaster in Dale, recruiters do not purport to speak\n“for”—and cannot reasonably be understood to be speaking\n“for”—the law schools that they are visiting. This case thus\ndoes not involve “[t]he forced inclusion of an unwanted\nperson in a group.” Dale, 530 U.S. at 648. It cannot be denied\nthat this was the genesis of the constitutional injury in Dale.\n\n        Second, as noted in my discussion of Hurley, recruiting\nis an economic activity whose expressive content is strictly\nsecondary to its instrumental goals. In contrast, the\nfundamental goal of the relationship between adult leaders\nand boys in the Boy Scout movement is “[t]o instill values in\nyoung people,” a goal that is pursued “by example” as well as\nby word. Id. at 649, 650. As a result, compelling the BSA to\nappoint an adult leader who was committed to “advocacy of\nhomosexual teenagers’ need for gay role models,” id. at 645,\nstruck at the heart of the organization’s goals.\n\n       Military recruiting is not intended to “instill values” in\nanyone, nor is it meant to convey any message beyond the\nmilitary’s interest in enlisting qualified men and women to\nserve as military lawyers and judges. As a result, the burden\non the law schools’ associational interests is vastly less\nsignificant than the burden imposed on the BSA by the statute\nin Dale.\n\n                               97\n\f        These profound distinctions demonstrate that the\nteachings of Dale lack the power to dilute the judiciary’s\ntraditional deference to Congress in the interest of national\ndefense.\n\n                              VII.\n\n        I now turn to the proper measure by which to evaluate\nthe weighing of competing interests implicated in this case.\nThere should be no question that the teachings of United\nStates v. O’Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107701\"><a href=\"/opinion/107701/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968), control. In that case,\nthe Court considered whether a 1965 amendment to the\nUniversal Military Training and Service Act, which\nprohibited the knowing destruction or mutilation of a\nSelective Service Registration Certificate, was\nunconstitutional as applied to a man who burned his\ncertificate as a symbolic expression of his antiwar beliefs. Id.\nat 369-370. The Court stated:\n\n       We cannot accept the view that an apparently\n       limitless variety of conduct can be labeled\n       “speech” whenever the person engaging in the\n       conduct intends thereby to express an idea.\n       However, even on the assumption that the\n       alleged communicative element in O’Brien’s\n       conduct is sufficient to bring into play the First\n       Amendment, it does not necessarily follow that\n       the destruction of a registration certificate is\n\n                               98\n\f       constitutionally protected activity. This Court\n       has held that when “speech” and “nonspeech”\n       elements are combined in the same course of\n       conduct, a sufficiently important governmental\n       interest in regulating the nonspeech element can\n       justify incidental limitations on First\n       Amendment freedoms.\n\n\n\n\nId. at 376.\n\n        In this case, the law schools portray their efforts to\nkeep military recruiters off their campuses as “quintessential\nexpression.” (Appellant br. at 20.) But when an institution\nexcludes military recruiters from its campuses or otherwise\nrestricts their access to students, it is engaging in something\ndifferent from “quintessential expression.” It is engaging in a\ncourse of conduct which contains both nonspeech and speech\nelements. The acts which the law schools claim they are\ncompelled to do by virtue of the military’s post-2001\n“unwritten policy”—disseminating and posting military\nrecruitment literature, making appointments for military\nrecruiters to meet with students and providing military\nrecruiters a place to meet with students—also contain both\nnonspeech and speech elements.\n\n       The constitutional framework for evaluating such laws\n\n                              99\n\fis provided by O’Brien. Regulation of conduct that imposes\nincidental burdens on expression is constitutional if “it\nfurthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if\nthe governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of\nfree expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged\nFirst Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to\nthe furtherance of that interest.” 391 U.S. at 377. “[A]n\nincidental burden on speech is no greater than is essential, and\ntherefore is permissible under O’Brien, so long as the neutral\nregulation promotes a substantial government interest that\nwould be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.”\nAlbertini, 472 U.S. at 689. Regulations of conduct that place\nincidental burdens on expression are not subject to a least-\nrestrictive-alternative requirement “[s]o long as the means\nchosen are not\n\nsubstantially broader than necessary to achieve the government’s\ninterest, . . . the regulation will not be invalid simply because a\ncourt concludes that the government's interest could be\nadequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative.”\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (1989).\n\n       The Solomon Amendment readily passes constitutional\nmuster under these constitutional standards. The Appellants\nthemselves do not dispute that the government has a substantial\ninterest—indeed, a compelling one— in recruiting talented men\nand women for the nation’s armed forces. As the Court\nrecognized in O’Brien, “the Nation has a vital interest in having\na system for raising armies that functions with maximum\n\fefficiency . . .” 391 U.S. at 381. Effective military recruiting is\nthe linchpin of that system. See City of Phil., 798 F.2d at 86\n(“Congress considers access to college and university\nemployment facilities by military recruiters to be a matter of\nparamount importance.”)\n\n        The government’s interest in military recruiting, as\nembodied in the Solomon Amendment, is manifestly “unrelated\nto the suppression of free expression.” O’Brien, 391 U.S. at 377.\nThe Solomon Amendment makes no effort to condition federal\nfunding on the absence of campus criticism of military policies;\na law school and its faculty and students are free to denounce\nmilitary recruiting policies without jeopardizing federal funding\nin the slightest. The only thing that\n\nmatters under the Solomon Amendment is whether the\ninstitution is denying access to military recruiters. And if the\ninstitution is denying access, it is irrelevant under the Solomon\nAmendment whether its reasons for doing so are communicative\n(to convey a message about its own principles or those of the\nmilitary) or non-communicative (for example, to avoid\nparticipation in a recruiting process that it regards as unfair).\nWhat matters under the Solomon Amendment is “only the\nindependent noncommunicative impact of [the] conduct,” id. at\n382,—its impact on the ability of the military to reach students.\n\n      The Appellants argue that because the Solomon\nAmendment is intended to facilitate military recruiting, and\nbecause recruiters speak to students, the governmental interest\n\funderlying the Solomon Amendment “is not unrelated to\nexpression.” (Appellant br. at 26.) But the question posed by\nO’Brien is not whether the governmental interest is “unrelated\nto expression,” but instead whether the interest “is unrelated to\nthe suppression of free expression.” 391 U.S. at 377 (emphasis\nadded). The Appellants’ argument deliberately omits the\ntouchstone of suppression from the constitutional test. Once it\nis recognized that suppression of expression is the focus of\nO’Brien, the Appellants’ argument falls apart, for the\ngovernmental interests served by the Solomon Amendment are\nmanifestly unrelated to the suppression of anyone’s expression.\n\n       It bears constant emphasis that the First Amendment test\ninvolves a balancing-of-interests as repeatedly emphasized\nabove. The O’Brien measure is quintessentially correct because\nthis case involves a weighing of the government’s interest in\nnational defense and Appellants’ interest in First Amendment\nprotections. In this posture it is difficult to conjure a case that is\na more perfect fit for the exposition in O’Brien.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                102\n\f</pre>",
