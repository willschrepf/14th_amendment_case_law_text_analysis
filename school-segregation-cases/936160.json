In Sandin v. Conner, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 2300 (1995), the Supreme Court held that an inmate has a state-created liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause only where the restraint \"imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\"   Here, while Song alleges that he was denied certain privileges during his placement in disciplinary segregation (for 21 days prior to his disciplinary hearing and for 60 days after his disciplinary hearing), such as \"limited canteen,\" \"phone,\" \"showers\" and \"recreation equipments,\" he does not allege to what extent these privileges were restricted and how these restricted privileges compared to the privileges afforded inmates in the general population.  See id. at 2301 (\"Based on a comparison between inmates inside and outside disciplinary segregation, the State's actions in placing [the inmate] there for 30 days did not work a major disruption in his environment.\").  Song has therefore failed to allege \"a dramatic departure from the basic conditions\" of his confinement that would give rise to a liberty interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Song's reliance on Walker v.
