Health & Safety Code § 361.001-.966 (West 2010)\n\n(hereinafter “SWDA”).\n\nI.   STATEMENTS OF FACTS\n\n     A. Appellant’s Statement of Facts is not Controverted\n\n     Appellant showed the steps the TCEQ took in investigating, listing,\n\npreparing to remediate the Voda Site and issuing the Order (Appellant’s\n\nBr. 1-5), in accordance with Subchapter F of the SWDA. (Appellant’s Br.\n\n23). Appellees do not contradict these facts, and they must be accepted as\n\ntrue. Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(g).\n\n     B.   Appellees’ Statement of Facts Focuses on Irrelevancies\n\n     Appellees focus on three areas in their Statement of Facts. Although\n\nnone are relevant to this appeal, the State will address them to clarify the\n\nrecord.\n\n     Appellees describe response actions by the U.S. Environmental Protec-\n\n\n\n                                      1\n\ftion Agency (“EPA”) at the Voda Site, with the implication that the TCEQ\n\nneed not have taken any further remedial action. (Appellees Br. 1-3.)\n\nHowever, Appellees ignore the fact that EPA contemplated a subsequent\n\nState-led investigation and remedial action to address soil contamination at\n\ndepth, and groundwater contamination on and migrating off of the Site.\n\n(AR 61923-24, AR 943, AR 59594-60117 and AR 60253-83.)\n\n    Second, Appellees complain that they lacked the opportunity to be\n\nheard before the Commission. (Appellees Br. 3-5.) Appellees had many\n\nopportunities to present information to the TCEQ during the 15-year\n\nSuperfund process, see Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 361.181-.188, and they\n\nsubmitted detailed input. (See, e.g., CR 910-12, with references to the\n\nadministrative record.) Appellees chose not to appear at the Commission\n\nmeeting regarding approval of the Order (AR 50382; video file), and not to\n\njoin Luminant’s Motion for Rehearing (AR 50864-89).\n\n    Finally, Appellees address the subsequent history of the appeal in the\n\nDistrict Court, with the implication that the TCEQ’s pleadings and state-\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\fments there are relevant to the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction. (Appel-\n\nlees Br. 6-8.) They are not relevant, however, because the TCEQ cannot\n\nconfer jurisdiction by such statements. (See infra at sec. V.C.1.)\n\nII. REPLY TO APPELLEES’ SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       Appellees make various conclusory statements, none of which deny\n\nthat the Order was issued under Subchapter F procedures and contained\n\nthe “laundry list” of items required of a § 361.188 order. (Appellees’ Br. 9-\n\n11.)\n\n       Appellees assert that, “Potentially responsible parties are entitled to\n\ntheir day in court.…” (Appellees’ Br. 11.) This, together with statements in\n\ntheir Statement of Facts, suggests a Due Process argument. But this inter-\n\nlocutory appeal is only about subject-matter jurisdiction. The District Court\n\ncan consider issues of equity and Due Process after this Court determines\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nIII. REPLY TO APPELLEES’ STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n       Appellees’ argument rests on an inference that a waiver of sovereign\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fimmunity anywhere in a statute applies to all causes of action (or, in this\n\ncase, appellate provisions) in the statute. To the contrary, waivers of\n\nsovereign immunity are strictly construed and must be expressed in clear\n\nand unequivocal terms. See Berry v. Tex. Democratic Party, 449 S.W.3d 633,\n\n640 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, no pet. h.) (citations omitted); see also Tex.\n\nGov’t Code § 311.034. Thus, a waiver limited to one action is inapplicable\n\nto other actions, even in the same statute.\n\n    Appellees argue that, “What the parties actually dispute is precisely\n\nwhat evidence the trial court may consider in reviewing the Order.… The\n\nState’s plea is not a challenge to the trial court’s subject matter jurisdic-\n\ntion.…” (Appellees’ Br. 11-12.) To the contrary, the State is asserting that,\n\nfor this type of order, the District Court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nunder § 361.321 but not under § 361.322. (Appellant’s Br. 32-38.) This is a\n\nplea to the jurisdiction, therefore, not merely a dispute over the evidence.\n\nEssentially, this Court is being asked to decide whether the District Court\n\nwill exercise its original fact-finding jurisdiction or its appellate jurisdiction\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fover the Order.\n\n    Appellees further assert that, “the State cannot maintain a plea to the\n\njurisdiction in this case because its own pleadings defeat its claim.” (Appel-\n\nlees’ Br. 12.) However, the State’s pleadings cannot confer jurisdiction by\n\nconsent, waiver or estoppel. (See sec. V.C.1, infra.)\n\nIV. REPLY CONCERNING ISSUE ONE\n\n    Appellees attempt to show that the two types of order, despite being in\n\ndifferent sections of the statute and having different elements and proce-\n\ndures, are “not mutually exclusive.” (Appellees’ Br. 14.) They reason that\n\n“both types of orders share elements outlined in Subchapters I, K, and L of\n\nthe Act, including but not limited to: … [a]n appellate provision. Id. at\n\n§ 361.322.” (Appellees’ Br. 14-15.) To the contrary, while the orders have\n\nsome elements in common (due to § 361.188(b)), they cannot both be\n\nappealed under § 361.322.\n\n    A. The plain language of § 361.322 limits that section to\n       appeals of § 361.272 orders\n\n    The plain language of the statute says that § 361.322 is limited to the\n\n\n                                       5\n\fappeals of § 361.272 orders: “Any person subject to an administrative order\n\nunder Section 361.272 may appeal the order by filing a petition.…” SWDA\n\n§ 361.322(a) (emphasis added). See also id. §§ 361.322(g) and (h) (referring to\n\n“the administrative order.”)\n\n    Conversely, § 361.321 applies generally to a “ruling, order, decision, or\n\nother act of the commission,” but contains the following exclusion: “Except\n\nas provided by Section 361.322(e) [read 361.322(g)], in an appeal from an\n\naction of the commission … the issue is whether the action is invalid,\n\narbitrary, or unreasonable.” Id. § 361.321(e). (See Appellant’s Br. 13 con-\n\ncerning the outdated reference to § 361.322(e).) Thus, the two appellate\n\nsections are separate and have different standards of review.\n\n    The fact that § 361.322 refers to § 361.272 orders, and does not mention\n\nany others, indicates that the Legislature did not intend for it to apply to\n\nany other type of order. See United Servs. Auto. Ass’n v. Brite, 215 S.W.3d\n\n400, 403 (Tex. 2007), citing Mid-Century Ins. Co. of Tex. v. Kidd, 997 S.W.2d\n\n265, 273–74 (Tex. 1999) (referring to the “doctrine of expressio unius est\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\fexclusio alterius—the inclusion of a specific limitation excludes all others—a\n\nstatutory interpretation tool of some use under [certain] circumstances.”).\n\nEach appellate section stands alone.\n\n    B.   The language and structure of the SWDA create separate\n         orders and separate appeals\n\n         1.   The current language of the statute correctly reflects the\n              intent of the Legislature\n\n    Appellees refer to the statutory history in an attempt to show that both\n\ntypes of order have always been subject to the same appellate standards.\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 15-29.) One problem with this analysis is that what is now\n\nSubchapter F, including §§ 361.181-.188, was substantially rewritten in\n\n1989-90, and the appellate cross-references were codified at the same time.\n\n    The Legislature codified the SWDA in the Regular Session of 1989. See\n\nAct of May 18, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 678, § 1, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 2230,\n\n2616-64. (App. 1:2616-64.) In that same session, it enacted amendments\n\nthat were not codified. See Act of May 24, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 703, § 5,\n\n1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 3212, 3218-32. (App. 2:3218-32.) Those amendments\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fincluded a substantial rewriting of § 13 (now Subchapter F), to the extent\n\nthat they practically created a new program. Id. (App. 2:3218-32.) The next\n\nyear, in the Sixth Called Session, the Legislature codified the new amend-\n\nments. See Act of June 6, 1990, 71st Leg., 6th C.S., ch. 10, art. 2, § 29, 1990\n\nTex. Gen. Laws 47, 66-80 (amended 1997) (current version at Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code §§ 361.181-.202). (App. 3:66-80.)\n\n    In the same act that codified the new Subchapter F, the Legislature also\n\nincorporated the uncodified amendment to § 9(b) (now § 361.322(a)) and\n\nincluded this reference: “Any person subject to an administrative order\n\nunder Section 361.272 may appeal the order by filing a petition.…” Id. § 28,\n\n1990 Tex. Gen. Laws 64-65 (current version at Tex. Health & Safety Code\n\n§ 361.322(a)). (App. 3:64-65.) They also amended § 361.321(c) with the\n\ncross-reference, “[e]xcept as provided by Section 361.322(a)....” Id. at 64\n\n(current version at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 361.321(c)).\n\n    If the Legislature had wanted § 361.188 orders to be appealed under\n\n§ 361.322, this was the perfect opportunity to say so. But they did not, and\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\finstead left § 361.188 orders to be appealed under § 361.321, the general\n\nappellate section. The relevant language has not changed in the interven-\n\ning 25 years.\n\n    The legislative intent is clear from the text, and the statutory history\n\ndoes not show a different intent before codification. The plain language\n\nshows that each separate ordering section has an independent appellate\n\nsection.\n\n           2.   The pre-codification statutory history shows separate\n                orders and separate appeals\n\n    Even if there were some ambiguity in the current text, and a review of\n\nthe statutory history were necessary, that history does not support the\n\nconclusions Appellees attempt to draw.\n\n    First, Appellees provide an extensive statutory history (Appellees’ Br.\n\n13-22), only to draw the same conclusions, as to the pre-codification\n\nstatute, that they drew regarding the current statute (compare Appellees’ Br.\n\n15 with id. at 21). That history does not alter any conclusions about the\n\nmeaning of the statute.\n\n\n                                          9\n\f    For example, after the 1985 amendments, the “preponderance of the\n\nevidence” clause of § 9(c) (now § 361.322(e)) was made applicable only to\n\n§ 8(g) (now § 361.272) orders; the “invalid, arbitrary or unreasonable”\n\nstandard of § 9 (now § 361.321) applied to all the rest (e.g., to § 361.188).\n\nThat language carries forward to the present statute. In other words, the\n\ncodifiers correctly carried forward the prior meaning to the current statute.\n\n    Appellees acknowledge that the 1989 amendments limited the applica-\n\nbility of § 9(b) (now § 361.322) appeals to “any person subject to an admin-\n\nistrative order under 8(g)” (now § 361.272). (Appellees’ Br. 21.) The same\n\nbill, they acknowledge, allowed the TCEQ to continue the remedial action\n\nprogram under § 13 (now Subchapter F), unless enjoined, and added the\n\nother provisions now found at § 361.322. (Appellees’ Br. 22.) However,\n\nthey do not acknowledge the obvious conclusion: that the pre-codified\n\nstatute, like the current version, had separate appellate provisions for the\n\ndifferent types of orders.\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f    C. Cross-references between subchapters do not merge the\n       ordering sections\n\n        1.   Section 361.188(b) merely incorporates provisions from\n             other subchapters into § 361.188 orders\n\n    Appellees argue that § 361.188 and § 361.272 orders are not mutually\n\nexclusive, although they appear in different sections and use different\n\nlanguage. (Appellees’ Br. 23.) One reason, they say, is that § 361.188(b)\n\nincorporates the provisions of Subchapters I, K and L into § 361.188 orders,\n\n“including the same appellate provisions.” (Appellees’ Br. 23-24.) This is\n\nillogical, however, since both §§ 361.321 and 361.322 are in Subchapter K—\n\nand both cannot apply to the same § 361.188 order. The difference is that\n\n§ 361.322 appeals are expressly limited to § 361.272 orders, while § 361.321\n\nappeals are applicable generally.\n\n        2.   Section 361.322(e) does not merge the orders\n\n    Appellees point out that § 361.322(e) allows the Subchapter F process\n\nto continue even after a § 361.272 order is appealed (unless enjoined).\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 24.) However, this clause does not make the orders any less\n\n\n\n                                      11\n\fseparate or distinct.\n\n    Section 361.272 orders are useful in certain circumstances:\n\n        (1) When an order is needed quickly to address exigent circum-\n    stances, and there is insufficient time to complete the exhaustive\n    Subchapter F procedures;\n\n         (2) When the remedy is fairly obvious and straightforward (such\n    as the removal of all contaminated material), because a full-blown\n    remedial investigation would be unnecessary; and\n\n         (3) When a stopgap is needed initially to stabilize the site while\n    the full Superfund process is carried out under Subchapter F.\n\n    Section 361.322(e) is designed to facilitate option (3). The fact that the\n\nTCEQ can conduct a full investigation and issue a § 361.188 order, while a\n\n§ 361.272 order is on appeal, does not make the orders any less separate or\n\ndistinct. In fact, it shows that they are separate orders.\n\n    D. The term “person affected” does not limit § 361.321 to\n       permit appeals\n\n    Appellees assert that the SWDA appellate provisions distinguish\n\nbetween Superfund and permitting orders, not between different kinds of\n\nSuperfund orders. (Appellees’ Br. 25.) The reason, they say, is that the\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\fterm “person affected” in § 361.321 limits that section to permitting ap-\n\npeals. (Appellees’ Br. 25-27.) They say, “[b]oth its statutory history and its\n\ncurrent role in the SWDA demonstrate clear legislative intent that § 361.321\n\nis the appellate provision for the permitting program, not the Superfund\n\nprogram.” (Appellees’ Br. 27, citations omitted.)\n\n    To the contrary, while it is undoubtedly true that the definition of\n\n“person affected” in § 361.003(24) applies to permitting decisions, it does\n\nnot follow that the same term in § 361.321 limits that section to the appeals\n\nof permit matters.\n\n         1.   The definition of “person affected” is broad enough to\n              cover persons named in Superfund orders\n\n    A person named in a Superfund order is affected by the order. That\n\nperson is required to be responsible for a share of the response costs\n\nincurred at the site, and thus has an economic interest in the outcome. That\n\nperson can “demonstrate[] that the person has suffered or will suffer actual\n\ninjury or economic damage,” within the meaning of id. § 361.003(24).\n\nLikewise, the person named in the Superfund order was determined to\n\n\n                                        13\n\fhave done business at the site (see definition of “Person Responsible for\n\nSolid Waste” at id. § 361.271), and was therefore “doing business … in the\n\ncounty” within the meaning of id. § 361.003(24)(B).\n\n    Definitions in the SWDA apply “unless the context requires a different\n\ndefinition.” Id. § 361.003. In context, this definition is broad enough to\n\nencompass persons named in Superfund orders, for purposes of appeals\n\nunder § 361.321.\n\n         2.   Under Appellees’ interpretation, there might be no appeal\n              for § 361.188 orders\n\n    Appeals under § 361.322 are limited, by the plain language of that\n\nsection, to orders issued under § 361.272. If § 361.321 were restricted to\n\nnon-Superfund matters, then there would be no clear, unambiguous\n\nwaiver of immunity for § 361.188 orders. Since this Order was procedurally\n\nand substantively a § 361.188 order (see Issue Two, sec. V, infra), Appellees\n\nwould have no appeal in the present case.\n\n    The TCEQ does not argue that the Legislature intended for there to be\n\nno appeal for a § 361.188 order. The most reasonable interpretation is that\n\n\n                                       14\n\f“persons affected,” in the case of a § 361.188 order, is meant to include the\n\npersons named in the order.\n\n         3.   Under Appellees’ interpretation, only permit matters and\n              § 361.272 orders could be appealed\n\n    Appellees undoubtedly overstate their argument in saying that\n\n“§ 361.321 is the appellate provision for the permitting program… .”\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 27.) In fact, § 361.321 is the general appellate provision for\n\nthe SWDA.\n\n    Matters other than permitting decisions have been appealed under\n\n§ 361.321. See, e.g., Tex. Water Comm’n v. Lindsey, 855 S.W.2d 750, 752 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 1993, writ denied) (appeal of an agency letter determin-\n\ning PRP status; appeal may be taken under § 361.321 and venue is proper\n\nin Travis County.) See also, Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852\n\nS.W.2d 440, 441, n.2 at 442, 450 (Tex. 1993) (a constitutional review of\n\nadministrative penalty sections in several statutes, including the then-\n\nexisting § 361.252 of the SWDA; assuming that such orders could be\n\nappealed, but holding that prepayment procedures violated the Open\n\n\n                                       15\n\fCourts doctrine.)\n\n    E.   Conclusion\n\n    The Legislature contemplated, considered, and enacted two different\n\ntypes of administrative orders for Superfund actions. Section 361.188\n\norders are issued when the TCEQ completes the procedures set forth in\n\nSubchapter F, whereas § 361.272 orders are reserved for situations where\n\ncircumstances demand quicker action. Each order has its own independent\n\nmechanism for appeal. Appellees’ arguments that the appellate remedies\n\nset forth in § 361.321 are restricted to non-Superfund actions are erroneous.\n\nV. REPLY CONCERNING ISSUE TWO\n\n    Appellees’ response to Issue Two is notable for what it does not say. It\n\ndoes not assert that the TCEQ failed to do any of the things required under\n\n§§ 361.181-.188, or that the Order is missing any of the “laundry list” of\n\nrequirements in § 361.188. It does not contradict the facts the TCEQ set out\n\nin this regard (Appellant’s Br. 1-5). The TCEQ asserts that this is a § 361.188\n\norder because it was issued in accordance with all the procedural and\n\n\n\n                                      16\n\fsubstantive requirements of Subchapter F of the SWDA. Appellees do not\n\ncontrovert this argument.\n\n    Appellees’ argument is otherwise, and somewhat contradictory. First,\n\nthey assert that the Order “was issued under both § 361.188 and § 361.272\n\nof the SWDA.” (Appellees’ Br. 29.) Then they say, “the AO for the Voda\n\nSite was issued under § 361.272, making application of § 361.322 appropri-\n\nate for this Order.” (Appellees’ Br. 30.)\n\n    Their reasoning depends on two arguments: First, that the TCEQ made\n\nvarious statements, both at the agency level and before the District Court,\n\nto the effect that the Order was issued under both sections. Second, they\n\nsay that certain provisions of Subchapters I, K and L have been incorpo-\n\nrated into the Order pursuant to § 361.188(b), and this converts the Order\n\nto a § 361.272 order. However, neither of these arguments challenges the\n\nessential nature of the Order or affects the subject-matter jurisdiction of the\n\ncourts.\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f    A. The content of the Order shows that it was issued under\n       Subchapter F\n\n    Appellees assert that several parts of the Order incorporate authorities\n\nfrom subchapters other that Subchapter F. (Appellees’ Br. 30.) These\n\ninclude the definition of “solid waste” as well as “hazardous substances”\n\namong the materials at the Site, the definition of “responsible parties,” the\n\ndivisibility of the release, the list of Chemicals of Concern, etc. (Appellees’\n\nBr. 30-32.) They conclude that “these provisions flatly contradict the\n\nState’s position that the AO was issued solely under § 361.188.” (Appellees’\n\nBr. 31.)\n\n    This argument, however, ignores the language of § 361.188(b)—that\n\n“[t]he provisions in Subchapters I, K, and L relating to administrative\n\norders apply to orders issued under this section.” SWDA § 361.188(b).\n\nAppellees have admitted that this clause “is open ended and inclusive, and\n\ndemonstrates that the Legislature intended all ‘administrative orders’ of\n\nthe SWDA to share common procedural attributes.…” (Appellees’ Br. 24.)\n\nThe fact that § 361.188(b) incorporates elements from other subchapters\n\n\n                                       18\n\fdoes not turn the Order into a § 361.272 order.\n\n    B.   Contrary statements did not change the essential nature of\n         the Order\n\n    Appellees refer to various statements by the TCEQ to the effect that the\n\nOrder was issued under both sections. These statements all relate back to a\n\nboilerplate clause in the preamble to the Order itself, which said that the\n\nExecutive Director’s requested relief included a Superfund order “as\n\nauthorized by Sections 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act.” (AR 50383.)\n\n    Prior to the Supreme Court’s opinion in City of Waco, Texas case law\n\nheld that, “substantial-evidence review on an agency record is simply ‘not\n\npossible’ absent the opportunity to develop that record through a con-\n\ntested-case or adjudicative hearing.” City of Waco v. Tex. Comm’n on Envtl.\n\nQuality, 346 S.W.3d 781, 818 (Tex. App.—Austin 2011), rev’d, 413 S.W.3d\n\n409 (Tex. 2013). The parties believed that, if the matter were appealed,\n\nsome judicial fact-finding was inevitable in the trial court. The agenda\n\nnotice and the statement by the staff attorney simply reflected the boiler-\n\nplate in the preamble to the Order, and were not statements about the\n\n\n                                     19\n\fanticipated standard of review on appeal. In presenting the Order to the\n\nCommission, the staff attorney summarized the actions the TCEQ took in\n\ncompliance with the Subchapter F program. (AR 50382; video file, oral\n\nstatement at 1:18.)\n\n    The TCEQ’s statement in its Reply to Luminant’s Motion for Rehearing\n\n(concerning the lack of need for an adjudicative hearing) did not affect\n\nsubstantive rights. (See Appellees’ Br. 32-33; AR 49650.) The TCEQ rea-\n\nsoned that no hearing was required for a § 361.272 order, by virtue of Tex.\n\nHealth & Safety Code § 361.274—however, no hearing was required for\n\neither type of order. (AR 49650.) The TCEQ was not saying that a hearing\n\nwas precluded by the combined effects of both ordering sections, simply\n\nthat no hearing was required under either section. Substantive rights were\n\nnot affected by any assertion about the Order being issued under both\n\nsections.\n\n    The TCEQ cannot waive sovereign immunity though its own state-\n\nments. (See sec. V.C.1, infra.) The Order is defined by its substance and the\n\n\n\n                                      20\n\fprocedures used to create it, and the Appellees do not contest that it has all\n\nthe characteristics of a § 361.188 order. It follows from the plain language\n\nof the statute that appeal is under § 361.321. The TCEQ lacks the power to\n\nwaive sovereign immunity and admit that the Order is something that it is\n\nnot, or that appeal is proper under a different section.\n\n    C. The State’s prior pleadings did not waive, agree to, or confer\n       jurisdiction\n\n    Appellees refer to various pleadings and agreed judgments in which\n\nthe State said that the Order was issued under both §§ 361.188 and 361.272.\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 33-34.) However, the State’s prior pleadings cannot defeat\n\nthis plea.\n\n         1.   The State’s pleadings did not create waivers of sovereign\n              immunity\n\n    The parties to lawsuits—in their pleadings or otherwise—cannot\n\nwaive, agree to, or confer jurisdiction. See, e.g., Comptroller v. Landsfeld, 352\n\nS.W.3d 171, 174 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2011, pet. denied) (subject matter\n\njurisdiction “may not be conferred by waiver or estoppel.”) (citing Van\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\fIndep. Sch. Dist. v. McCarty, 165 S.W.3d 351, 354 (Tex. 2005)). See also\n\nMetzger v. Metzger, No. 01-04-00893-CV, 2007 WL 1633445, *7 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied) (mem. op.)

Brieven, 176 S.W.3d 108, 113 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. denied) (quoting Tourneau Houston,\n\nInc. v. Harris Cnty. Appraisal Dist., 24 S.W.3d 907, 910 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.)).\n\n    Only the Texas Legislature, and not an agency, can waive sovereign\n\nimmunity:\n\n    This Court has long recognized that it is the Legislature’s sole prov-\n    ince to waive or abrogate sovereign immunity.… The Legislature\n    may consent to suits against the State by statute or by resolu-\n    tion.… Legislative consent to sue the State must be expressed in\n    clear and unambiguous language.\n\nTex.

Strayhorn, 148 S.W.3d 644, 649 (Tex. App.—\n\n\n\n                                      22\n\fAustin 2004, pet. denied) (“It is for the legislature alone ‘to waive or abrogate\n\nsovereign immunity.’”) (emphasis added), citing Fed. Sign v. Tex. S. Univ.,\n\n951 S.W.2d 401, 409 (Tex. 1997).\n\n         2.   Prior judgments and motions did not create waivers of\n              sovereign immunity\n\n    Appellees refer to two agreed final judgments and two motions for\n\ndefault judgment, which recited that the Order was issued under both\n\nsections. (Appellees’ Br. 34-35.) However, Appellees do not say how the\n\nparties to those judgments were affected by those statements, nor how\n\nAppellees themselves were affected. In fact, those statements simply\n\nreflected the boilerplate statement in the preamble to the Order. The scope\n\nand type of order, and the appellate provisions applicable to each type of\n\norder, were not at issue in any of those proceedings.\n\n    Neither the identity of the Order nor the language it contains has ever\n\nbeen in dispute. In the agreed final judgments, all causes of action related\n\nto the Order were being compromised and settled. (The judgments were\n\nsevered and filed in separate cases. However, the text of each can be seen\n\n\n                                       23\n\fwith the TCEQ’s notices of lodging. (See CR 275-436, 458-556.)) All claims\n\nrelated to the Order were being dismissed. Neither the settling parties’ nor\n\nAppellees’ rights were affected by the boilerplate statements.\n\n    Appellees also refer to a statement in the TCEQ’s Third Amended\n\nOriginal Answer that the “sole method for appealing the Order” is at Tex.\n\nHealth & Safety Code § 361.322. (Appellees’ Br. 35, CR 678.) That state-\n\nment was in the context of a plea to the jurisdiction seeking to dismiss a\n\nclaim under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act on the grounds of\n\nredundancy. (CR 677-79.) The motion should have said that the “sole\n\nmethod” of appeal was under § 361.321. However, the underlying argu-\n\nment was still sound—that the UDJA action offered nothing but redundant\n\nremedies. In context, the statement did not draw a distinction between two\n\ndifferent sections of the SWDA, but between remedies offered in the UDJA\n\nversus the SWDA. Moreover, the statement did not create a waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity.\n\n    If any party’s pleadings are to be binding, it is those of Appellees—\n\n\n\n                                     24\n\fwho expressly limited their prayer for relief to whether “the TCEQ’s\n\nAdministrative Order is invalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable and therefore\n\nmust be overturned pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code § 361.321(e).”\n\n(CR 25.)\n\n           3.   The State did not seek to obtain the advantages of a\n                § 361.272 order by saying that it issued the Order under\n                both sections\n\n    Appellees assert that, “the Commission invoked § 361.272 in an\n\nattempt to hold the [potentially responsible parties (“PRP’s”)] for the Voda\n\nSite jointly and severally liable under the SWDA.” (Appellees’ Br. 37.) To\n\nthe contrary, the TCEQ did not invoke § 361.272 for that reason, because it\n\nwas not necessary to do so. Section 361.276 (“Apportionment of Liability”)\n\nis made applicable to § 361.188 orders by virtue of § 361.188(b). The fact\n\nthat the TCEQ asserted there is joint and several liability for this Order\n\ndoes not make it a § 361.272 order.\n\n    D. Section 361.322(e) does not merge § 361.188 and § 361.272\n       orders\n\n    Appellees say that, “the issuance of an order under § 361.272 does not\n\n\n                                         25\n\fpreclude the Commission from the listing process of § 361.181-188.” (Ap-\n\npellees’ Br. 37, citing § 361.322(e).) While this is true, it does not lead to the\n\nconclusion that the ordering sections are somehow merged. (See discussion\n\nof § 361.322(e) at sec. IV.C.2, supra.)\n\n    The TCEQ may work through the Subchapter F process, and even\n\nissue a § 361.188 order, after the issuance and appeal of a § 361.272 order.\n\nAppellees imply that this has some relevance to the current situation, but it\n\ndoes not. In the present case, the TCEQ did the Subchapter F process first,\n\nand then issued the § 361.188 Order. Section 361.322(e) is irrelevant.\n\n    E.   Reviewing this Order under § 361.322 would make\n         Subchapter F redundant\n\n    In a trial court brief, the TCEQ asserted that “[r]eview under Section\n\n361.322 would render Subchapter F redundant.” (CR 1091.) The reason\n\nwas that the TCEQ would not go through the “elaborate, time-consuming\n\nand expensive,” Subchapter F process if it had to re-prove liability at trial\n\nby preponderance of the evidence anyway. (CR 1092.) “That practical\n\nconsideration would turn Subchapter F into surplusage, which would be\n\n\n                                          26\n\fcontrary to the intent of the Legislature.” Id. In the present case, it would\n\nmean that the TCEQ had wasted 15 years, and a lot of money, establishing\n\nfindings that would have to be re-established by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\n\n    Appellees do not address this argument directly. Instead, they respond\n\nby complaining that they were not offered a contested-case hearing before\n\nthe agency, and did not have the opportunity to show that they were not\n\n“persons responsible for solid waste.” (Appellees’ Br. 38-39.) However,\n\nAppellees had numerous opportunities to show that they were not PRP’s\n\nand present other information to the TCEQ. The Legislature did not\n\nprovide a redundant contested-case hearing as part of that process.\n\n    Appellees do not address the question of subject-matter jurisdiction;\n\ninstead, they complain about the supposed effects of a substantial evidence\n\nreview. When they suggest that the Order will be “the final word on\n\nliability,” (Appellees’ Br. 39), they grossly overstate the applicable standard\n\nof review. Appellees’ arguments about their own liability are premature in\n\n\n\n                                      27\n\fthis interlocutory appeal.\n\n    Further, their distinction between agency expertise on liability versus\n\nremedy selection is misplaced. (See Appellees’ Br. 38-39.) Essentially, they\n\nare saying that they question the agency’s expertise when it comes to\n\ndetermining their own liability. However, the agency has expertise in\n\ndetermining PRP status; it must go through the relevant procedures set out\n\nin Subchapter F, and did so for this Order in detail. (AR 12512-16706.)\n\n    F.   The Order was properly issued under § 361.188\n\n    The TCEQ asserted that: “[a] single order cannot arise under both\n\nSections 361.188 and 361.272.” (Appellant’s Br. 18.) The rationale was that,\n\n“[t]he orders must be separate and distinct because they have different\n\ndeadlines for appeal,” and “each appellate section provides for a different\n\nstandard of review.” Id.\n\n    From this, Appellants illogically conclude that the remedy is “to\n\noverturn the Order as a violation of law.” (Appellees’ Br. 40.) They arrive\n\nat this conclusion only by assuming that the TCEQ issued the Order\n\n\n\n                                     28\n\f“under both § 361.188 and § 361.272.” (Appellees’ Br. 41.) Since that is the\n\nmatter in controversy, their argument lacks logic and must fail. This Order\n\nwas properly issued under § 361.188—not § 361.272, and not both.\n\n    G. Conclusion\n\n    The TCEQ’s boilerplate language in the preamble to the Order is not\n\ncontrolling or dispositive as to the nature of the Order, nor are the TCEQ’s\n\nstatements or pleadings. What is controlling is the substance of the Order\n\nand the process the TCEQ followed leading up to its entry. Appellees do\n\nnot dispute that the TCEQ completed the procedures set forth in Sub-\n\nchapter F. If the TCEQ had intended to issue a § 361.272 order, it would\n\nhave done so early in the process rather than at the end. The Order was\n\nproperly issued under § 361.188 and is properly reviewed under § 361.321.\n\nVI. REPLY CONCERNING ISSUE THREE\n\n    The TCEQ asserted that “[b]ecause of the doctrine of Sovereign Immu-\n\nnity, the courts lack jurisdiction to review the Order under any section\n\nother than Section 361.321.” (Appellant’s Br. 32.) The premises of that\n\n\n\n                                     29\n\fargument were that (a) the ordering sections are mutually exclusive, and\n\n(b) this Order was issued under § 361.188. (Appellant’s Br. 32.)\n\n    Appellees respond that “[j]udicial review of the Administrative Order\n\nfor the Voda Site is constitutional and appropriate under § 361.322 of the\n\n[SWDA].” (Appellees’ Br. -ix-.) However, they start with different pre-\n\nmises. They posit that “the substantial evidence review procedures found\n\nin the APA are not applicable to this appeal” (Appellees’ Br. 41), and then\n\nargue that “judicial review under § 361.322 does not violate the separation\n\nof powers doctrine.” (Appellees’ Br. 42.)\n\n    In other words, Appellees are saying that an order issued under\n\n§ 361.272 is properly appealed under § 361.322, and there is no constitu-\n\ntional impediment to doing so. Even assuming that argument to be sound,\n\nit is irrelevant here because the present case involves a § 361.188 order—as\n\nestablished in Issues One and Two, above. Appellees do not controvert the\n\nessence of the TCEQ’s jurisdictional argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                     30\n\f       A. The constitutionality of § 361.322 is not at issue\n\n           1.   Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.174 restates existing law\n\n       The TCEQ asserted that “[u]nder the Separation of Powers Doctrine,\n\nthe courts review administrative orders only as to matters of law.” (Appel-\n\nlant’s Br. 35.) That was in the context of an argument showing that the\n\nTexas Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) (specifically, Tex. Gov’t\n\nCode § 2001.174) codified the Legislature’s understanding of the existing\n\nlaw of judicial review of state agency actions. (Appellant’s Br. 35-37.)\n\n       Appellees do not controvert the proposition that Tex. Gov’t Code\n\n§ 2001.174 restated existing law. Instead, they argued that “the separation\n\nof powers doctrine only prohibits the Legislature from authorizing de novo\n\njudicial review of quasi-legislative acts that address broad questions of\n\npublic policy or promulgate rules for future application.” (Appellees’ Br.\n\n42.)\n\n       However, issues concerning the constitutionality of the “preponder-\n\nance of the evidence” requirement in § 361.322(g) are irrelevant here. Given\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fthat this Order was issued under § 361.188, it is properly reviewed under\n\nthe “invalid, arbitrary or unreasonable” standard of § 361.321(e). (See also,\n\nargument and authorities at sec. VI.C.1, infra.)\n\n    Appellees cite cases in which statutes required trials de novo for\n\ncertain agency decisions. (Appellees’ Br. 43-46, citing Commercial Life Ins.\n\nCo. v. Tex. State Bd. of Ins., 808 S.W.2d 552 (Tex. App.—Austin 1991, writ\n\ndenied) and Macias v. Rylander, 995 S.W.2d 829 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999,\n\nno pet.). The issue in each case was whether those requirements violated\n\nthe Separation of Powers doctrine (they did not). See Commercial Life, 808\n\nS.W.2d at 554-55; Macias, 995 S.W.2d at 832-33. Again, however, that is\n\nirrelevant here because § 361.321 does not require a trial de novo.\n\n    Meanwhile, in the present case, the TCEQ has shown that the review\n\nof this Order under the “invalid, arbitrary or unreasonable” standard of\n\n§ 361.321(e) is conducted in the same manner as review under the provi-\n\nsions of Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.174. (Appellant’s Br. 37-38.)\n\n\n\n\n                                      32\n\f         2.   The Legislature’s decision to allow the review of this\n              § 361.188 order under the “invalid, arbitrary or unreason-\n              able” standard is consistent with the emerging law in this\n              area\n\n    The issue in this interlocutory appeal is whether the courts have\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to consider an appeal of an agency order under\n\none section of a statute, when the only proper appeal is under a different\n\nsection. This raises a question of Sovereign Immunity, since the State has\n\nnot waived its immunity generally. Each waiver must be in “express and\n\nunequivocal terms.” See Berry, 449 S.W.3d at 640, quoting Prairie View A&M\n\nUniv. v. Chatha, 381 S.W.3d 500, 512 (Tex. 2012); see Tex. Gov’t Code\n\n§ 311.034. “‘[N]o state can be sued in her own courts without her consent,\n\nand then only in the manner indicated by that consent.’” Tooke v. City of\n\nMexia, 197 S.W.3d 325, 331 (Tex. 2006) quoting Hosner v. DeYoung, 1 Tex.\n\n764, 769 (1847).\n\n    The Separation of Powers doctrine, which is similar but not identical,\n\nholds that judicial review (when authorized) may not re-determine the\n\nfacts found by the agency. The distinction was explained by this Court, as\n\n\n                                       33\n\ffollows:\n\n    [A]n administrative agency’s order made within its discretionary\n    statutory and constitutional authority is ordinarily shielded by\n    sovereign immunity from suit, such that there is no right to judi-\n    cial review, unless and until the Legislature has waived that\n    immunity by conferring a right of judicial review.… However,\n    even while the Legislature generally has the prerogative to waive\n    sovereign immunity to permit judicial review, Texas courts have\n    long held separation-of-powers principles bar the judiciary—even\n    where the Legislature has purported to grant such broad review\n    powers—from redetermining the fact findings of agencies exercis-\n    ing their administrative functions.\n\nCity of Waco, 346 S.W.3d at 815 (Tex. App.—Austin 2011), rev’d on other\n\ngrounds, 413 S.W.3d 409 (Tex. 2013) (citing Gerst v. Nixon, 411 S.W.2d 350,\n\n353–54 (Tex.1966) and S. Canal Co. v. State Bd. of Water Eng’rs, 318 S.W.2d\n\n619, 622-24 (Tex. 1958)) (other citations omitted). That distinction is still\n\nvalid.\n\n    B.     The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco is\n           pertinent to this SWDA appeal\n\n    The TCEQ asserted that “[a] contested case hearing is not required for\n\nreview of this Order under substantial evidence,” referring to the Supreme\n\nCourt’s City of Waco decision. (Appellant’s Br. 38-39, citing Tex. Comm’n on\n\n\n                                       34\n\fEnvtl. Quality v. City of Waco, 413 S.W.3d 409 (Tex. 2013).) Appellees\n\nresponded that “[t]he Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco is not\n\ncontrolling in this SWDA appeal.” (Appellees’ Br. 48.) To the contrary, the\n\nSupreme Courts rulings in that case—and this Court’s subsequent applica-\n\ntions of those rulings—define the proper approach here.\n\n         1.   City of Waco did not merely make a “threshhold determina-\n              tion”\n\n    Appellees would limit the applicability of City of Waco by saying that\n\nthe case “is limited to a threshold determination of whether a third-party\n\nseeking to intervene in a permitting case is an ‘affected person’ sufficient to\n\ntrigger a contested-case hearing.” (Appellees’ Br. 10, 48.) However, that\n\nwas not the relevant characteristic of the case. The case actually turned on\n\nthe finding that the amended permit would not “significantly increase or\n\nmaterially change the authorized discharge of waste” and would therefore\n\nqualify for a statutory exemption from the contested-case requirement. City\n\nof Waco, 413 S.W.3d at 424-25 (Tex. 2013). The TCEQ made a fact-based\n\ndetermination from the information, evidence, documents, and arguments\n\n\n                                      35\n\fthat interested parties presented to the agency, and the Court upheld that\n\ndetermination. Id. (“We conclude that there is evidence in the record to\n\nsupport the Commission’s determination.…”) In the present case, the\n\nTCEQ made a similar determination respecting the Site remedy and Appel-\n\nlees’ status as PRP’s.\n\n    In City of Waco, the Texas Supreme Court upheld TCEQ’s decision\n\nbecause there was reasonable support in the agency record for the decision.\n\nId. at 424-25. Ultimately, that is what the TCEQ is requesting in the present\n\ncase. When applying the Supreme Court’s holding and analysis, this Court\n\nhas recognized that an agency’s decision is often found not to be arbitrary\n\nor capricious if the factual basis for the decision is supported by substantial\n\nevidence in the agency record. See Tex. Comm’n on Envtl. Quality v. Sierra\n\nClub, No. 03-12-00335-CV, 2014 WL 7464085, *5 (Tex. App.—Austin Dec.\n\n30, 2014, no pet. h.)\n\n    Appellees attempt to distinguish City of Waco by saying that, “the\n\npresent case has no connection to the Texas Water Code, permitting, or the\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\fstanding of third parties.…” (Appellees’ Br. 51.) However, these distinc-\n\ntions are irrelevant. Appellees are still making the assumption that the\n\n“preponderance of the evidence” burden of proof applies. (Appellees’ Br.\n\n51.) But it does not, and such analysis is beside the point. After City of\n\nWaco, the courts can review an agency order by the “abuse of discretion”\n\nstandard (including the substantial evidence component), even in the\n\nabsence of a contested case or adjudicative hearing below. The relevant\n\nprovision, § 361.321, mandates such a standard of review. That is the\n\nholding and the relevance of City of Waco.\n\n    Appellees attempt to distinguish the recent Sierra Club case, which\n\nfollows the City of Waco precedent. (See Appellees’ Br. 52-53, citing Sierra\n\nClub, 2014 WL 7464085.) Appellees admit that, “[a]pplying the holding\n\nfrom City of Waco, [this Court] held it must review ‘a TCEQ determination\n\nregarding affected-person status for an abuse of discretion.’” (Appellees’\n\nBr. 52, citing Sierra Club, 2014 WL 7464085 at *4.) Appellees do not say why\n\nthat case is distinguishable from the present case—presumably because it\n\n\n\n                                      37\n\finvolves party standing in a permit matter. But this Court cited City of\n\nWaco throughout the opinion and noted that, “[i]n making a decision\n\nregarding affected-person status, TCEQ enjoys the discretion to weigh and\n\nresolve matters that may go to the merits of the underlying application.…”\n\nSierra Club, 2014 WL 7464085 at *5, citing Sierra Club v. Tex. Comm’n on\n\nEnvtl. Quality, No. 03–11–00102–CV, 2014 WL 7463875 at *12 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin Dec. 30, 2014, no pet. h.) (other citations omitted).\n\n    To summarize, this Court has recently considered two different TCEQ\n\ndecisions—each within the agency’s discretion, on the substance of the\n\napplications, without contested case hearings—and reviewed them on the\n\nadministrative record based on the abuse of discretion standard. These\n\nprecedents support the TCEQ’s interpretation of City of Waco.\n\n    Finally, Appellees mischaracterize the State’s position as saying that\n\n“all TCEQ decisions—including those with specific statutory appellate\n\nprovisions to the contrary—are subject to review only through pure\n\nsubstantial evidence.” (Appellees’ Br. 53.) By contrast, the State’s actual\n\n\n\n                                      38\n\fposition is that City of Waco and its progeny allow a substantial evidence\n\nreview on appeal, even without a contested case hearing before the agency,\n\nwhen the relevant statute provides for such review. That is entirely consis-\n\ntent with precedent, and describes the present situation.\n\n    C. The “invalid, arbitrary or unreasonable” standard of\n       § 361.321(e) equates to the standard of Tex. Gov’t Code\n       § 2001.174\n\n        1.   Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.174 was intended to be a restate-\n             ment of the law\n\n    Appellees argue that the provisions of the APA contained at Tex.\n\nGov’t Code § 2001.174 do not apply here, because of the express terms of\n\nthat section. (Appellees’ Br. 53-54.) But this ignores the TCEQ’s actual\n\nargument: that the Legislature intended the APA to be a restatement of\n\nexisting law, not a new form of judicial review of agency actions. (Appel-\n\nlant’s Br. 36.) Following this argument, the “invalid, arbitrary or unreason-\n\nable” standard of § 361.321(e) simply means that the Order must be re-\n\nviewed under the standards of APA § 2001.174, of which substantial\n\nevidence is an important part. (Appellant’s Br. 37.) Appellees do not\n\n\n                                      39\n\fcontrovert the TCEQ’s actual argument.\n\n         2.   Review under the substantial evidence standard does not\n              require a contested case hearing\n\n    Appellees argue that “Outside of threshold standing questions, pure\n\nsubstantial evidence requires a true contested-case record under the APA.”\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 55-59.) However, they cite several cases that have been\n\neffectively overruled. One is Ramirez v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 927\n\nS.W.2d 770, 773 (Tex. App.—Austin 1996, no writ), which rejected the\n\nargument that the Legislature created a right of judicial review under the\n\nsubstantial evidence rule while depriving parties of an opportunity for a\n\ncontested case hearing. However, that case was cited in this Court’s\n\nopinion in City of Waco, 346 S.W.3d at 818, and was thus effectively over-\n\nruled by the Supreme Court’s subsequent opinion. (See Appellant’s argu-\n\nment at CR 1099-1100.)\n\n    Appellees also cite Tex. Dep’t of Ins. v. State Farm Lloyds, 260 S.W.3d\n\n233, 245 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, no pet.) (“Absent an administrative\n\nrecord, no substantial evidence review is required or even possible.”).\n\n\n                                      40\n\f(Appellees’ Br. 59.) Like Ramirez, that case has been effectively overruled\n\nby City of Waco.\n\n    Appellees then cite G.E. Am. Commc’n v. Galveston Cent. Appraisal Dist.,\n\n979 S.W.2d 761, 767 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.), and\n\nquote: “Substantial evidence review cannot have been the proper standard\n\nbecause there is no record from the appraisal review board hearing.”\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 56.) The Fourteenth Court of Appeals concluded that,\n\nbecause there was no record to review, the correct standard of review was\n\nsubstantial evidence de novo—so that the court could create a record. G.E.\n\nAm., 979 S.W.2d 767. However, substantial evidence de novo has been\n\nrejected by this Court as the default standard of review. See Gilder v. Meno,\n\n926 S.W.2d 357, 361 (Tex. App.—Austin 1996, writ denied). In addition, like\n\nthe Ramirez case, the holding has been effectively overruled by the Su-\n\npreme Court in City of Waco. Finally, the TCEQ has compiled an exhaustive\n\nrecord in this case, and thus the rationale of G.E. American does not apply.\n\nG.E. American is simply not a good precedent here. (See CR 1101.)\n\n\n\n                                     41\n\f    Appellees attempt to distinguish various cases that are, in fact, good\n\nlaw. See, e.g., Smith v. Houston Chem. Servs., Inc., 872 S.W.2d 252, 257 n.2\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1994, writ denied). Smith interprets § 361.321—the\n\nsame section that defines the standard of review in the present case—and\n\nfound that the language of § 361.321(e) implies substantial evidence review\n\nunder the provisions of § 2001.174 of the APA. Smith is on point because it\n\ninterprets the exact section that is at issue in the present case. Smith, 872\n\nS.W.2d at 257 n.2 (“To render [this statute] understandable, and to protect\n\nagainst its possible violation of the separation-of-powers mandate of the\n\nConstitution of the State of Texas, we construe subsection (a) [of § 361.321]\n\nas authorizing suits for judicial review in a district court of Travis County\n\nin accordance with APA § 2001.001-.902.).\n\n    Appellees also argue that the Kelsoe case was not decided on substan-\n\ntive grounds. (Appellees’ Br. 57, citing Tex. Comm’n on Envtl. Quality v.\n\nKelsoe, 286 S.W.3d 91, 97 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, pet. denied) (petitioner\n\nasserted that “section 361.321 of the health and safety code only appl[ies]\n\n\n\n                                       42\n\fafter a contested case hearing, but the plain language of the statute[] does\n\nnot support that conclusion; the statute[] speak[s] of seeking review of any\n\n‘ruling, order, decision, or other act.’”). Kelsoe, 286 S.W.3d at 95. Even so,\n\nthe case shows this Court’s recent interpretation of the section that is at\n\nissue here; thus, it has precedential value.\n\n    Smith and Kelso are not distinguishable on the basis of contested case\n\nhearing because those appeals were filed under the broad language of\n\n§ 361.321.\n\n    Appellees attempt to distinguish United Copper Indus., Inc. v. Grissom,\n\n17 S.W.3d 797 (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. dism’d), principally on the\n\ngrounds that it is limited to “affected person” issues. (Appellees’ Br. 57-\n\n58.) However, the TCEQ cited that case for various propositions—\n\nprincipally, that “the APA, interpreting existing law, supports the proposi-\n\ntion that the Order must [be] reviewed under the substantial evidence\n\nstandard.” (Appellant’s Br. 37.) This is a general interpretation of the\n\nstatute, and is not limited to issues of party status.\n\n\n\n                                       43\n\fVII.       CONCLUSION\n\n       Appellant has shown that there are two separate ordering provisions\n\nwithin the SWDA, and that each has a separate appellate provision. The\n\nproposition that these sections are merged is not supported by the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute, its history, or by case law.\n\n       Appellees essentially admit that the order was procedurally and\n\nsubstantively issued under § 361.188, but then argue that it was also issued\n\nunder § 361.272 because those sections were merged. This proposition is\n\nlikewise unsupported by statutory interpretation or existing precedents.\n\n       Given that this Order was issued under § 361.188, and that the statute\n\nprovides for appeal under § 361.321, it follows that appeal under any other\n\nsection is beyond the subject-matter jurisdiction of the courts. This conclu-\n\nsion is entirely consistent with emerging precedents in administrative law.\n\nVIII.

(a) A person responsible for solid waste under Section\n361.271 is liable under Section 361.272 or 361.273 unless the person can establish by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the release or threatened release was caused solely\nby:\n      (1) an act of God;\n      (2) an act of war;\n      (3) an act or omission of a third person; or\n      (4) any combination of Subdivisions (1), (2), and (3).\n   (b) In a defense under Subsection (a)(3), the defendant must establish by a preponder-\nance of the evidence that the defendant:\n      (1) exercised due care concerning the solid waste, considering the characteristics of\n   the solid waste, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances; and\n      (2) took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissiuns of the third person and the\n   consequences that could foreseeably result from those acts or omissions.\n   (c) The defense under Subsection (a)(3) does not apply if the third person:\n      (1) is an employee or agent of the defendant; or\n      (2) has a direct or indirect contractual relationship with the defendant and the act or\n   omission of the third person occurred in connection with the contractual relationship.\n   (d) In Subsection (c)(2), \"contractual relationship\" includes land contracts, deeds, or\nother instruments transferring title or possession of real property.\n   (e) A defendant who enters into a contractual relationship as provided by Subsection\n(c)(2) is not liable under this subchapter if:\n      (1) the sole contractual relationship is acceptance for rail carriage by a common\n   carrier under a published tariff; or\n      (2) the defendant acquired the real property on which the facility requiring the\n   remedial action is located, after the disposal or placement of the hazardous substance\n   on, in, or at the facility and the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the\n   evidence that:\n         (A) the defendant has satisfied Subsection (b);\n         (B) at the time the defendant acquired the facility the defendant did not know and\n      had no reason to know that a hazaJ'dous substance that is the subject of the release\n      or threatened release was disposed of on, in, or at the facility;\n         (C) the defendant is a governme1.tal entity that acquired the facility by escheat, by\n      othE:r involuntary transfer or acquisition, or by the exercise of the power of eminent\n      domain; or\n         (D) the defendant acquired the facili~ by inheritance or bequest.\n   (f) To demonstrate the condition under Subsection (e)(2)(B), the defendant must have\nmade, at the time of acquisition, appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses\nof the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice in an effort to\nminimize liability. In deciding whether the defendant meets this condition, the court shall\nconsider:\n      (1) any specialized knowledge or experience of the defendant;\n      (2) the relationship of the purchase price to the valu~ ~ the property if the propert;1\n   were uncontaminated;\n      (3) commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property;\n                                            2659\n\fCh. 678, § 1                                7lst LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\nt 381.275\n      (4) the obvious presence or likely presence of contamination of the property; and\n      (5) the defendant's ability to detect the contamination by appropriate inspection.\n   (g) This section does not decrease the liability of a previous owner or operator of a\nfacility who is liable under this chapter. If the defendant obtained actual knowledge of the\nrelease or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility at the time the\ndefendant owned the real property on which the facility is loca4!d and subsequently\ntransferred ownership of the property to another person without disclosing that knowl-\nedge, the defendant is liable and a defense under this section is not available to the\ndefendant.\n   (h) Subsections (e)-(g) do not affect the liability under this chapter of a defendant who,\nby an act or omission, caused or contributed to the release or threatened release of a\nhazardous substance that is the subject of the action concerning the facility.

(a) If the release or threatened\nrelease caused by a person's acts or omissions is proved by a preponderance of the\nevidence to be divisible, that person is liable only for the elimination of, that release or\nthreatened release attributable to the person. If the release or threatened release is not\nproved to be divisible, persons liable under Section 361.272 or 361.273 are jointly and\nseverally liable for eliminating the release or threatened release.\n   (b) In this section, \"divisible\" means that the waste released or threatened to be\nreleased has been and is capable of being managed separately under the remedial action\nplan~ (V.A.C.S. Art. 4477-7, Sec. 8(g)(4).)\n   Sec. 361.277. JUDGMENT BY STATE AGAINST NONSETTLING PARTY; ACTION\nFOR CONTRIBUTION BY NONSETTLING PARTY. (a) If fewer than all of the persons\nidentified as liable under this subchapter agree with the state to take remedial action to\nabate an actual or threatened release of solid waste that is an imminent and substantial\nendangerment to the public health and safety or the environment under an administrative\norder issued under Section 361.272 or an action filed by the state under this subchapter,\nthe state may seek a jud~ment against a nonsettling person for the total amount of the\ncost of the remedial action minus that amount the settling persons agree to pay or spend.\n   (b) In an action for contribution brought by a nonsettling person against a settling\nperson, the nonsettling person has the burden to prove that the amount of cleanup costs\nthat a settling person agreed to pay under an agreement with the state is unreasonable\nconsidering the factors under Section 361.343 and the need to undertake timely cleanup\naction concerning the release or threatened release. (V.A.C.S. Art. 4477-7, Sec. 8(g)(5).)\n   Sec. 361.278. LIABILITY OF ENGINEER OR CONTRACTOR.

Section 9601 et seq.), the\n   federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, and Sections 8(g) and\n   13 of this Act.                                                                     ·\n   SECTION 5. Section 13, Solid Waste Disposal Act (Article 4477-7, Vernon's Texas\nCivil Statutes), is revised to read as follows:\n   Sec. 13. IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND CLEANUP OF HAZARDOUS\nWASTE FACILITIES. (a) The commission shall annually publish an updated state\nregistry identifying, to the extent feasible, every facility that may constitute an\nimminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the environ·\nment due to a release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environ·\n                                           3218\n\f71et LEGISLATURE-REGULAU SESSION                                           Ch. 703, § 5\n ment. The registry shall identify the relative priority for action at each listed\nfacility. The relative priority for action at facilities listtd on the registry shall be\n periodically reviewed and revised by the commission, as necessary to accurately\n reflect the need/or action at the facilities. For thtJ purposes of this section, \"facility\"\n means (1) any building, structure, installation, equipment, pipe, or pipeline (includ-\ning any pipe into a sewer or publicly owned treatment works, well, pit, pond, lagoon,\nimpoundment, ditch, landfill, storage container, motor vehicle, rolling stock, or\naircraft), or (2) any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited,\nstored, disposed of, or placed or otherwise come to be located,· but does not include\n any consumer product in con.'lumer use or any vessel.\n   (b) The executive director may conduct investigations of facilities which are listed\n on the state registry, or which it has reason to believe should be included on the state\nregistry, in accordance with Section 7 of this Act. If there is a reasonable basis to\n believe there may be a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a\nfacility, the executive director may submit requests for information and requests for\n the production of documents to any person who has or may have information' or\ndocuments relevant to:\n      (1) the identification, nature, or quantity of materials that have been generated,\n   treated, stored, or disposed of at a facility or transported to a facility;\n      (2) the identification of soils, ground water, or surface water at a facility that\n   have been or may be affected by an actual or threatened release of a hazardous\n   substance;\n      (3) the nature or extent of a release or threatened release of a hazardous\n   substance at or from a facility; or\n      (4) the ability of a person to pay for or to perform a remedial action.\n   If the requested information or documents are not produced in a timely manner,\n the commission may issue an order directing compliance with the requests for\ninformation or production of documents. Information or documents requested\nunder this subsection shall be public records, except that, if a showing satisfactory to\n the commission is made by the owner of the records that the records would divulge\n trade secrets if made public, then the commission shall consider the copied records as\nconfidential. Nothing in this subsection .'/hall require the commission to consider the\ncomposition or characteristics of hazardous substances being processed, stored, dis·\nposed of, or otherwise handled to be held confidential. The commission shall promul-\ngate rules regarding the provision of notice and an opportunity for a hearing before\n the commission on whether the requested injormaf.ion or documents should be\nproduced.\n   (c) Prior to the listing of a facility on the state registry, the executive director shall\nfirst determine whether the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the\nenvironment at the facility can be resolved by the present owner or operator under\n the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 8901) or by\nsome or all of the potentially responsible parties identified in Section B(g), pursuant\n to an agreed administrati?Je order issued by the commission. If the potential endan-\ngerment to public health and safety or the environment can be resolved in such a\nmanner, the facility shall not be listed on the state registry. Notice of the approach\nselected to resolve the apparent endangerment to health and public safety or the\nenvironment and the fact that this action is being taken in lieu of listing the facility\non the state registry shall be published in the Texas Register. If after reasonable\nefforts the executive director determines that the potential endangerment to public\nhealth and safety or the environment cannot be resolved by either of these approaches,\n the executive director shall evaluate the facility to determine whether the site exceeds\n the commission~ minimum criteria for listing on the state regisi ry. These minimum\ncriteria shall be promulgated by rule. The executive director sltall also evaluate the\nfacility to determine whether it is eligible for listing on the federal National Priorities\nList. The commission shall proceed under this section only if, based on information\navailable to the executive director, the facility is eligible for listing on the state\nregistry but not eligible for the federal National Priorities List.\n                                           3219\n\fCh. 703, § 5                              7lst LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     (1) Once the executive director has determined that the facility is eligible for\n listing on the state registriJ, the commission shall publish in the Texas Register and\n in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located a\n notice of intent to list the facility on the state registry. The notice shall at least\n specify the name and location of tlte facility, the general nature of the potential\n endangerment to public health and safety or the environment as determined by\n information available to the executive director at that time, and the duties and\n restrictions imposed by Subsection (c)(3) . of this section. The notice also shall\n provide that interested parties may do either or both of the following: (A) submit\n written comments to the commission relative to the proposed listing of the facility,·\n or (B) request a public meeting to discuss the proposed listing by submitting a\n  request within 30 days of issi;ance of the notice.\n    (2) Once the facility is determined tCJ be eligible for listing on the state registry,\n  the executive director shall make all reasonable efforts to identify all potentially\n responsible parties/or remediation of the facility. Concurrent with the publication\n of general notice in accordance with Subdivision (1) of this subsection, the executive\n director shall provide to e3.ch identified potentially responsible party direct, written\n notification of the proposed listing of the facility on the state registry and of the\n procedures for requesting a public meeting to discuss the listit.:i and the inform.a·\n  tion included in the general notice as required by Subdivision (1) of thi'l subsection.\n  Written notifications under this subsection shall be by certified mail, return receipt\n requested, by mailing notice to each named responsible party at the party 8 last\n known address.\n    (3) If a public meeting is requested regarding the proposed listing of a facility on\n  the state registry, the commission shall publish general notice of the date, time, and\n location of the public meeting in the Texas Register and in the same newspaper in\n which the notice of the opportunity to request the public meetin,Q was published.\n  The public meeting notice shall be provided at least 30 days in advance of the\n meeting. Notice of the meeting also shall be provided by certified mail, return\n receipt requested, to all identified potentially responsible parties at the parties' last\n known addresses. Nonreceipt of any notice mailed to a potentially responsible\n party pursuant to this subdivision or Subdivision (2) of this subsection shall in no\n way affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities imposed on the party. Contem·\n poraneously with the issuance of notice of the public meeting, the executive director\n shall make available to all interested parties the public records he has regarding the\n facility. For the purposes of providing this information, the executive director\n shall provide a brief summary of the public records he has and make these public\n records available for inspection and copying during regular business hours.\n    (4) The public meetings will be legislative in nature and not contested case\n hearings under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article\n 6252-13a, Vernons Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held/or the purpose\n of obtaining additional information regarding the facility relative to the eligibility\n of the facility for listing on the state registry and the identification of potentially\n respon:Jible partfos.\n    (5) Subsequent to the public meeting or after opportunity to request a public\n meeting has passed, the commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or\n notice in the real property records of the county in which a facility is located\n identifying the facility as one proposed for listing on the state registry, unless the\n executive director determines, based on information presented at the public meet·\n ing, that efforts to list the facility on the state registry should not be pursued.\n    (6)(A) Subsequent to the public meeting or after opportunity to request a pubtic\n meeting has passed, but prior to any listing of the facility on the state registry, the\n commission shall allow all identified potentially responsible parties the opportuni·\n ty to fund or conduct, if appropriate, a remedial investigation/feasibility study, or\n similar study as approved by the executive director, for the facility. The potentially\n responsible parties shall have 90 days from the date of the issuance of notice of the\n opportunity to request a public meeting to make a good faith offer to conduct the\n                                         3220\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                         Ch. 703, § 5\n study. If a good faith offer from all or some of the potentially responsible parties is\n received by the commission within 90 days, those making the offer sl:all have an\n additional 60 days within which to negotiate an agreed administrative order from\n  the commission, which shall include a scope of work. The commission shall not\n require the participating potentially responsible parties to agree to perform the\n remedial action or admit liability for the facility remediation in this agreed\n administrative order.\n       (B) If no potentially responsible party makes a good faith offer to conduct the\n    remedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study as approved by the\n    executive director or .if the participating potentially responsible parties fail to\n    conduct or complete an· approved study, the commission is authorized to conduct\n    or complete the study using funds from the hc;,zardous waste disposal fee fund.\n       (C) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial inves-\n    tigation/feasibility Etudy or other similar study as approved by the executive\n    director, no costs for commission oversight of the study may be assessed against\n    those parties who fund or perform the study. Nonparticipating pote.ttially\n    responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of\n    the facility under this Act or who subsequentll' enter into an agreed ordu relative\n    to the remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs fot\n    commission oversight of the study process. If all potentially responsible parties\n    participate or agree to fund the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other\n    similar study, all commission oversight costs shall be borne by the hazardous\n    waste disposal fee fund.\n       (D) Once the executive director has determin 1u;! that a facility is eligible for\n    listing on the state registry, no person shall perform at the facility any partial or\n    total removal activities except as authorized by the executive director in appropri-\n    ate circumstances after notice and opportunity for comment to all other poten-\n    tially responsible parties. The commission may develop rules determining what\n    constitutes an appropriate circumstance to take removal action under this\n    paragraph. Authorization by the executive director to conduct a partial or total\n    removal action shall not constitute a final determination of the party$ ultimate\n    liability for remediation of the facility, nor a determination of divisibility.\n    (7)(A) Once the facility is determined to be eligibl1?for listing on the state registry,\n the owner or operator of the facility must provide the executive director with\n written notice of any substantial change in use of the facility at least 60 days before\n the change in use is made. Notice of a prnposed substantial change in use shall be\n in writing, addressed to the executive director, provided by certified mail, return\n receipt requested, and shall include a brief description of the proposed change in\n use. A substantia! change in use shall be defined by rule and shall include but not\n be limited to actions such as the erection of a building or other structure at the\n facility, the use of the facility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility\n for use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or\n private recreational use on the facility.\n       (B) If, within 30 days of the notice, the executive director determines that the\n    proposed substantial change in use will interfere significantly with a proposed or\n    ongoing remedial investigation/feasibility study, or similar study approved by\n    the executive director, or expose the public health and safety or the environment\n    to a significantly increased threat of harm, then he shall notify the owner or\n    operator of his determination. Once the determination is made and notification\n    given, the owner or operator shall not proceed with the proposed substantial\n    change in use. The owner or operator may request a hearing before the commis-\n    sion on whether the determination should be modified or set aside by submitting\n    a request within 30 days of receipt of the executive director$ determination. If a\n    hearing is requested, the commission shall initiate the hearing within 45 days of\n    the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the\n    Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon$\n                                          3221\n\fCh. 703, § 5                              71et LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     Texas Civil Statutes). The executive director's determination shall become unap-\n     pealable 30 days after issuance if a hearing is not requested.\n    (8) Within a reasonable time following the completion of the remedial investiga·\n  tionlfeasibility study or other similar study, if required, the executive director shall\n select a proposed remedial action. Subsequent to its selection of a proposed\n remedial action, the commission shall hold a public meeting to discuss the proposed\n action. The commission shall publish notice of the meeting in the Texas Register\n and in a newspaper ofgeneral circulation in the county where the facility is located\n at least 45 days prior to the public meeting. The notice shall provide information\n regarding the proposed remedial action and the date, time, and place of the\n meeting. The commission shall also mail the same information to each potentially\n responsible party by certified mail, return receipt requested, at each party's last\n known address at least 45 days prior to the publii: meeting Contemporaneously\n with the issuance of notice of the public meeti1~g, the executive director shall make\n available to all interested parties the public records he has regarding the facility.\n For purposes of providing this information, the executive director shall provide a\n brief summary of the public records he has and make these public records available\n for inspection and copying during regular business hours. Nonreceipt of any notice\n mailed to a potentially responsible party pursuant to this subdivision shall in no\n 1;ay affect the responsibilities, duties, 01· liabilities imposed on any such party.\n    (9) The public meeting shall bt legislative in nature and not conducted as a\n contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act\n (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held for the\n purpose :if obtaining additional information regarding the facility and the identifi·\n cation of additional potentially responsible parties. Those in attendance may\n present their comments on the proposed remedial action, and the executive director\n may revise its proposed remedial action in light of the presentations.\n    (JO)(A) Subsequent to the public meeting on the proposed remedial action, the\n commission shall provide all identified potentially responsible parties an opportu-\n nity to fund or perform the proposed remedial action. The potentially responsible\n parties shall have 60 days from the date of the public meeting in which to make a\n good faith offer to perform or fund the proposed remedial action. If a good faith\n offer is made by all or some of the potentially responsible parties within the 6{1-day\n period, then these parties will have an additional 60 days to negotiate an aoreed\n administrative order from the commission, which shall include a scope of u ork.\n The commission shall not require an admission of liability in the agreed adr.1 inis·\n trative order.\n       (B) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial ac·\n    tion, no costs for commission oversight of the remedial action may be assessed\n    against those parties who fund or perform the remedial action. Nonpartic·\n    ipating potentially responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable\n    for remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs/or commission\n    oversight of the remedial action. If all potentially responsible parties conduct or\n    fund the remedial action, all commission oversight costs shall be borne by the\n    hazardous waste disposal fee fund. Participation in the remedial action does not\n    relieve those who did not conduct or fund the remedial investigation/feasibility\n    study or other similar study approved by the executive director from paying their\n    portion of the oversight costs of that phase of the remediation.\n       (C) The executive director may authorize a potentially responsible party to\n    conduct a partial remedial action at a portion of the facility if the executive\n    director determines that the release or threatened release is divisible after notice\n    and opportunity for comment to all other potentially responsible parties. For\n    purposes of this section, \"divisible\" means that the hazardous substance released\n    or threatened to be released is capable of being managed separately under the\n    remedial action plan. A determination of divisibility by the executive director\n    shall have no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on a potentially responsible\n    party's ultimate liability for remediation of the facility under Section 8.\n                                         3222\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                           Ch. 703, § 5\n      (11) After consideration of all good faith offers to perform a remedial action, the\n   commission shall issue a final administrative order that shall:\n        (A) list the facility on the state registry, thus determining that the facility poses\n      an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the\n      environment;\n        (B) specify the selected remedial action,·\n         (C) list the parties determined to be responsible for remediating the facility,·\n         (D) make findings offact describing actions voluntarily undertaken by respon-\n      sible parties,·\n        (E) order the responsible parties to remediate the facility and, if appropriate,\n      reimburse the hazardous waste disposal fee fund for remedial investigation/fea-\n      sibility study and remediation costs;\n        (F) establish a schedule for completion of the remedial action,·\n        (G) state any determination of divisibility of responsible party liability; and\n        (H) give notice of the duties and restrictions imposed by Subsection (/) of this\n      section.      ·\n   The provisions in Sections B(g), 9, 10, and 11 of this Act relating to administrative\norders shall apply to orders issued pursuant to this paragraph.\n      (12) If a potentially responsible party is newly identified after a final administra-\n   tive order has been issued by the commission pursuant to Subdivision (11) of this\n   sub~ection, that party shall have 60 days to negotiate an amendment to the existing\n   order. The commission shall not be prohibited from issuing a separate order for\n   the newly identified potentially responsible party if it determines that the circum-\n   stances warrant a separate order. The responsible parties identified in the order\n   issued pursuant to Subdivision (11) of this subsection shall be allowed to comment\n   on the issuance of a separate order for the newly identified potentially responsible\n   party.\n   (d) The commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or notice in the real\nproperty records of the county in which the facility is located stating that the facility\nhas been listed on or deleted from the state registry or is no longer proposed for\nlisting on the state registry, within a reasonable period after a determination has\nbeen made.\n   (e) Any owner or operator or other named responsible party of a facility listed or to\nbe listed in the state registry may request the commission to delete the facility from\n the state registry, modify the facility~ priority within the state registry, or modify\nany information regarding the facility by submitting a written statement setting\nforth the grounds of the request in the form as the commission may require pursuant\n to its promulgated rules. The commission shall promulgate rules establishing proce-\ndures, including public hearings, for review of requests submitted pursuant to this\nsubsection.\n   (/) Subsequent to the listing of a facility on the state registry, no person may\nsubstantially change the manner in which the facility is used without notifying the\nexecutive director and receiving written approval of the executive director for the\nchange. A substantial change in use shall be rll!fined by rule and shall include but\nnot be limited to actions such as the erection of u building or other structure at the\nfacility, the use of the facility for agriculturq,l production, the paving of the facility\nfor use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or\nprivate recreational use on the facility. The notice shall be in writing, addressed to\n the executive director, provided by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall\ninclude a brief description of the proposed change of use. The executive director shall\napprove or disapprove the proposed action within 60 days of receipt of the notice of\nproposed change in use. The executive director shall not approve the proposed change\nof use if such new use will significantly interfere with a proposed, ongoing, or\ncompleted remedial action program at a facility or expose the public health and\nsafety or the environment to a significantly increased threat of harm.\n                                           3223\n\fCh. 703, § 5                                71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n   (g)(J) Whenever the commission, after investigation, finds that there exists a release\nor threatened release of a hazardous substance at n facility that: (A) is causing\nirreversible or irreparable harm to the public health and safety or the environment,·\nand (B) the immediacy of the situation makes it prejudic.ial to the public interest to\ndelay action until an administrative order can be issue1t to potentially responsible\nparties or until a judgment can be entered in an appeal of an administrative order,·\n the commission may, with the funds available to the corn.mission from the hazardous\nwaste disposal fee fund, undertake immediate removal action at the facility to\nalleviate the harm. After the immediate danger of irreversible or irreparable harm\nhas been alleviated, the commission shall proceed pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection. Fi.ndings required pursuant to this subsection shall be in writing and may\nbe made by the commission on an ex parte basis subject to judicial review pursuant to\n the substantial evidence rule as provided by the Administrative Procedure and Texas\nRegister Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon~ Texas Civil Statutes).\n      (2) The reasonable expenses of any immediate removal action taken by the\n   commission may be recoverable from the persons described in Section 8, and the\n   state may seek to recover the reasonable expenses in any court of appropriate\n   jurisdiction.\n   (h) Whenever a person ordered to eliminate an imminent and substantial endan·\ngerment to the public health and safety or the environment has failed to do so within\n the time limits specified in the order or any extension of time approved by the\ncommission, the commission may implement the remedial action program for the\nfacility. The reasonable expenses of implementing the remedial action program by\n the commission shall be paid by the persons to whom the order was issued and shall be\nrecoverable under the provisions of Subsection (m) of this section.\n   (i)(J) The goal of any remedial action shall be the elimination of the imminent and\nsubstantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment posed\n by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility. The\nappropriate extent of the remedial action at any particular facility shall be deter-\n mined by the commission~ selection of the remedial alternative which the state\nagency determines is cost effective (i.e., the lowest cost alternative that is technologi-\ncally feasible and reliable and which effectively mitigates and minimizes damage to\nand provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the environment).\n      (2) In considering the appropriate remedial action program at a particular\n   facility, the commission may approve a program that does not attain a level or\n   standard of control at least equivalent to a legally applicable or relevant and\n   appropriate standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, as required by state or\n   local law, if the commission finds that:\n         (A) the remedial action selected is only part of a total remedial action that will\n      attain such level or standard of control when completed,·\n         (B) compliance with the requirement at that facility will result in greater risk\n      to public health and safety or the environment than alternative options,·\n         (C) compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an\n      engineering perspective,·\n         (D) the remedial action selected will attain a standard of performance that is\n      equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement,\n      criterion, or limitation through use of another method or approach,·\n         (E) with respect to a local standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, the\n      locality has not consistently applied (or demonstrated the intention to consistent-\n      ly apply) the standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation in similar circum-\n      stances of other remedial actions within the locality,· or\n         (F) with respect to an action using solely state funds, selection of a remedial\n      action that attains such levels or standards of control will not provide a balance\n      between the need/or protection of public health and safety or the environment at\n      the facility and the availabilty of state funds to respond to other sites that present\n                                           3224\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                        Ch. 703, § 5\n      a threat to public health and safety or the environment, taking into consideration\n      the relative immediacy of the threats.\n  (jJ In adflition to all other remedies available to the state under this Act or any\nother law or statute, all remediation costs for which a person is liable to the state\nshall constitute a lien in favor of the state on the real property and the rights to the\nreal property that are subject to or affected by a remedial action. This provision is\ncumulative of other remedies available to the state under this Act.\n      (JJ The lien imposed by this subsection shall arise and attach to th,e real property\n  subject to or affected by a remedial action at the time an affidavit is recorded and\n  indexed in accordance with this subsection in the county in which the real property\n  is located. For the purpose of determining rights of all affected parties, the lien\n  shall not relate back to a time prior to the date on which the affidavit is recorded,\n  which date shall be the lien inception date. The lien shall continue until the\n  liability for the costs is satisfied or becomes unenforceable through operation of law.\n      (2J The affidavit shall be executed by an authorized representative of the commis-\n  sion and must show:\n         (AJ the names and addresses of the persons liable for the costs,·\n         (BJ a description of the real property that is subject to or affected by the\n      remediation action for the costs or claims,· and\n          (CJ the amount of the costs and the balance due.\n      (9J The county clerk shall record the affidavit in records kept for that purpose\n  and shall index the affidavit under the names of the persons liable for the costs.\n      (4J The commission shall record a relinquishment or satisfaction of the lien when\n  the lien is paid or satisfied.\n     (SJ The lien may be foreclosed only on judgment of a court of competent jurisdic-\n   tion foreclosing the lien and ordering the sale of the property subject to the lien.\n      (6J The lien imposed by this subsection shall not be valid or enforceable if real\n  property or an interest therein or a mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance upon or\n  against real property is acquired before the affidavit is recorded, unless the person\n  acquiring the real property or an interest therein or acquiring the mortgage, lien,\n  or other encumbrance thereon had or reasonably should have had actual notice or\n  knowledge that the real property is subject to or affected by a clean-up action or has\n  knowledge that the state has incurred clean-up costs.\n      ('1J If a lien is fixed or attempted to be fixed as provided in this subsection, the\n  owner of the real property affected by the lien may file a bond to indemnify against\n  the lien. The bond shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the\n  real property subject to the lien is located. An action to establish, enforce, or\n  foreclose any lien or claim of lien covered by the bond must be brought not later\n   than the 90th day after the date of service of notice of the bond.\n      (BJ The bond must:\n         (AJ describe the real property upon which the lien is claimed,·\n         (BJ refer to the lien claimed in a manner sufficient to identify it,·\n          (CJ be in an amount double the amount of the lien referred to,·\n          (DJ be payable to the commission;\n         (EJ be executed by the party filing the bond as principal and a corporate surety\n      authorized under the law of this state to execute the bond as surety,· and\n          (FJ be conditioned substantially that the principal and sureties will pay to the\n      commission the amount of the lien claimed, plus costs, if the claim is proved to be\n      a lien on the real property.\n      (9J .After the bond is filed, the county clerk shall issue notice of the bond to the\n  named obligee. A copy of the bond must be attached to the notice. The notice may\n  be served on each obligee by having a copy delivered to the obligee by any person\n  competent to make oath of the delivery. The original notice shall be returned to the\n                                          3225\n\fCh. 703, § 5                               71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n    office of the county clerk, and the person making service of copy shall make an oath\n    on the back of the copies showing on whom and on what date the copies were served.\n    The county clerk shall record the bond notice and return in records kept for that\n    purpose. In acquiring an interest in real property, a purchaser or lender may rely\n    on and is absolutely protected by the record of the bond, notice, and return.\n       (10) The commission may sue on the bond after the 30th day following the date on\n    which the notice is served but may not sue on the bond later than one year after the\n    date on which the notice is served. If the commission recovers in a suit on the lien\n    or on the bond, it is entitled to also recover reasonable attorney's fees.\n   (k) Money for actions taken or to be taken by the commission in connection with the\n elimination of an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and\n safety or the environment pursuant to this section shall be payable directly to the\n commission from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund. This includes any costs of\n inspection or sampling and laboratory analysis of wastes, soils, air, surface water,\n and ground water done on behalf of a state agency and the costs of investigations to\n identify and locate potentially responsible parties.\n    (l) The commission shall seek remediation of facilities by potentially responsible\n parties prior to expenditure offederal or state funds for the remediations. Potential·\n ly responsible parties shall coordinate with ongoing federal and state hazardous waste\n programs, although no state or local permit shall be required for any removal or\n remedial action conducted on site. Subject to the provisions nf Subsection (i) of this\n section, the state may enforce any federal or state standard, requirement, criterion,\n or limitation to which the remedial action would otherwise be required to conform if a\n permit were required. No action taken by the person to contain or remove a release\n or threatened release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan shall be\n construed as an admission of liability for said release or threatened release. No\n person who renders assistance in containing or removing a release or threatened\n release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan shall be liable for any\n additional remediation costs at the facility resulting solely from acts or omissions of\n the person in rendering the assistance in compliance with the approvals required by\n this subsection, unless the remediation costs were caused by the person's gross\n negligence or wilful misconduct. Except as specifically provided in this subsection,\n these provisions shall not be construed to expand or diminish the common law tort\n liability, if any, of private parties participa~ing in a remediation action for civil\n damages to third parties.\n    (m) The commission sh1ill file a cost recovery action against all respomnble parties\n who have not complied with the terms of an administrative order issued pursuant to\n Subdivision (11} or (12) of Subsection (c) of this section. The commission shall file\n the cost recovery action no later than one year after all remedial action has been\n completed. The state may seek a judgment against the noncompliant parties for the\n total amount of the cost of the remedial action, including costs of any necessary\n studies and oversight costs, minus the amount agreed to be paid or expended by any\n other responsible parties pursuant to an order issued pursuant to Subdivision (11) or\n (12) of Subsection (c) of this section. The action may also include a plea seeking civil\n penalties for noncompliance with the commission's administrative order and a claim\n for up to double the state's costs if the responsible party's defenses are determined by\n the court to be unreasonable, frivolous, or without foundation.\n· (n)(l) A responsible party named in an administrative order who does not comply\n with the order shall become subject to the imposition of administrative or civil\n penalties under Section Bb of this Act. The penalties may be assessed only from the\n date after which the administrative order becomes nonappealable.\n       (2) The commission is authorized to include provisions within an agreed adminis·\n    trative order that stipulate administrative penalty amounts for failure to comply\n    with the order. The penalty provisions may be applicable to either or both of the\n    remedial investigation/feasibility study and remedial action orders.\n    (o)(l) The commiss-ion shall promulgate rules necessary to develop a mixed funding\n program in which available money from potentially responsible parties is combined\n                                          8226\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                            Ch. 703, § 5\nwith state or federal funds to clean up a facility in a timely manner. Use of the state\nor federal funds in a mixed funding approach shall not preclude the state or federal\ngovernment from seeking recovery of its costs from nonparticipating potentially\nresponsible parties.\n      (2) The commission shall assess and may, through rulemaking, develop and\n  implement a de minimis settlement program. Under the program, the commission\n  shall be required to consider the advantages of developing a final settlement with\n   potentially responsible parties that are responsible for only a minor portion of the\n  response costs at a facility because the hazardous substances the party is respon•\n  sible for are minimal in amount or in hazardous effect by comparison with the\n  hazardous substances attributable to other parties.\n      (3) The commission shall investigate additional alternative programs to encour·\n  age potentially responsible parties to investigate or remediate facilities and report\n   its findings to the 72nd Legislature with recommendations for legislative action.\n  (p) The commission is authorized to determine whether a potentially responsible\nparty is. financially capable of conducting any necessary remediation studies or\nremedial action. The commission shall promulgate rules to develop the criteria for\ndetermination of financial capability. If no financially capable potentially r~pon·\nsible parties exist for a facility, the commission shall issue an administrative order\nstating its determination that the facility constitutes an imminent and substantial\nendangerment and that there are no financially capable potentially responsible\nparties. The commission shall then conduct its own remediation study and remedial\naction, using federal funds if available. Iffederal funds are not available, state funds\nfrom the hazardous waste disposal fee fund shall be used. Generally, the remediation\nof listed facilities shall be achieved first by private party funding, second with the aid\nof federal funds, and third, if necessary, with state funds from the hazardous waste\ndisposal fee fund.\n  (q) The executive director or the commission shall have the authority to extend any\ntime period specified in this section if deemed appropriate.\n   [Seo. 13, IDENTIFICATION AND J..SSESSMENT OF HAZJ..RDO:US WASTE FA\nCIUTIES, (a) The department ef water reseurees, in eeeperatien with the department,\nshall oenduot and oemplete a survey ef the state by July 1, 11~8G 1 the pUFf19Se ef whioh is\nt9 identify te the extent feasible every hazardeus waste faoility whieh may oenstitute an\nimminent and substantial endangerment te publio health and safety er the envirenment,\nThe werk already perfermed te identify eandidate sites fur inolusien in the federal\nNatienal Pri9rities list shall serve as the basis fer suoh a sun•ey, As seen as pessible\nafter e9mpletien ef a draft survey, the department ef water reseurees shall eenduot a\npublio hearing te selieit oemments en the draft survey and inf9rmatien en additienal\neandidate sites.

Concurrent with the publication of\ngeneral notice under Subsection (a), the executive director shall provide to each\nidentified potentially responsible party direct, written notification of the proposed\nlisting of the facility on the state registry and of the procedures for requesting a\npublic meeting to discuss the listing and the information included in the general\nnotice as required by Subsection (a). Written notifications under this subsection\nshall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each named responsible party at\nthe party's last known address.\n   (c) If a public meeting is requested regarding the proposed listing of a facility on\nthe state registry, the commission shall publish general notice of the date, time, and\nlocation of the public meeting in the Texas Register arirl in the same newspaper in\nwhich the notice of the opportunity to request the public meeting was published. The\npublic meeting notice shall be provided not later than the 31st day before the date of\nthe meeting. Notice of the meeting also shall be provided by certified mail, return\nreceipt requested, to each ident~tied potentially responsible party at the party's last\nknown address.\n   (d) Nonreceipt of any notice mailed to a potentially responsible party under\nSubsection (b) or this subsection does not affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabili-\nties imposed on the party. Contemporaneously with issuing the notice of the public\nmeeting, the executive director shall make available to all interested parties the public\nrecords the executive director has regarding the facility. For the purposes of provid-\ning this information, the executive director shall provide a brief summary of those\npublic records and make those public records available for inspection and copying\nduring regular business hours.\n   (e) A public meeting is legislative in nature and not a contested case hearing under\nthe Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's\nTexas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held for the purpose of obtaining\nadditional information regarding the facility relative to the eligibility of the facility\nfor listing on the state registry and the identification of potentially responsible\nparties.\n   (/) After the public --neeting or after opportunity to request a public meeting has\npassed, the commissivr. shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or notice in the real\nproperty records of the county in which the facility is located identifying the facility\nas one proposed for listing on the state registry unless the executive director deter-\nmines, based on information presented at the public meeting, that efforts to list the\nfacility on the state registry should not be pursued.\n   Sec. 361.185. INVESTIGATION/FEASIBILITY STUDY. (a) After the public meet-\ning or after opportunity to request a public meeting has passed, but before any listing\nof the facility on the state registry, the commission shall allow all identified potential-\nly responsible parties the opportunity to fund or conduct, if appropriate, a remedial\ninvestigation/feasibility study, or a similar study as approved by the executive\ndirector, for the facility. Not later than the 90th day after notice under Section\n361.184(a) is issued, the potentially responsible parties may make a good faith offer to\nconduct the study. If a good faith offer from all or some of the potentially responsible\nparties is received by the commission within that period, those making the offer have\nan additional 60 days within which to negotiate an agreed administrative order from\nthe commission, which must include a scope of work. In the agreed administrative\norder the commission may not require the participating potentially r11sponsible\nparties to agree to perform the remedial action or admit liability for the facility\nremediation.\n   (b) If no pot mtinlly responsible party makes a good faith offer to conduct the\nremedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study as approved by the executive\ndirector or if the participating potentially responsible parties fail to conduct or\n                                            68\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION                         Ch. 10, Art. 2, § 29\ncomplete an approved study, the commission may conduct or complete the study\nusing funds from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.\n   (c) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial investiga-\ntionlfec;,sibility study or other similar study as approved by the executive director,\ncosts for commission oversight of the study may not be assessed against those parties\nwho fund or perform the study. Nonparticipating potentially re.<lponsible parties who\nare ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of the facility under this\nchapter or who subsequently enter into an agreed order relative to the remediation of\ntha facility may be assessed up to the full costs for commission oversight of the study\nprocess. If all potentially responsible parties participate or agree to fund the\n1emedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar study, all commission over-\nsight costs shall be paid from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.\n   Sec. 361.186. FACILITY ELIGIBLE FOR LISTING: ACTIVITIES AND CHANGE\nOF USE. (a) If the executive director determines that a facility is eligible for listing\non the state registry, a person may not perform at the facility any partial or total\nremoval activities except as authorized by the executive director in appropriate\ncircumstances after notice and opportunity for comment to all other potentially\nresponsible parties. The commission may adopt rules determining what constitutes\nan appropriate circumstance to take removal action under this subsection. Authori-\nzation by the executive director to conduct a partial or total removal action does not\nconstitute:\n      (1) a fi:nal determination of the party's ultimate liability for remedfotion of the\n   facility,· or\n      (2) a determination of divisibility.\n   (b) If the facility is determined to be eligible for listing on the state registry, the\nowner or operator of the facility must provide the executive director with written\nnotice of any substantial change in use of the facility before the 60th day before the\ndate on which the change in use is made. Notice of a proposed substantial change in\nuse must be in writing, addressed to the executive director, sent by certified mail,\nreturn receipt requested, and include a brief description of the proposed change in\nuse. A substantial change in use shall be defined by rule and must include actions\nsuch as the erection of a building or other structure at the facility, the use of the\nfacility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility for use as a roadway or\nparking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or private recreational use on\nthe facility.\n   (c) If, within 30 days after the date of the notice, the executive director determines\nthat the proposed substantial change in use will interfere significantly with a\nproposed or ongoing remedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study ap-\nproved by the executive director or expose the public health and safety or the\nenvironment to a significantly increased threat of harm, the executive director shall\nnotify the owner or operator of the determination. After the determination is made\nand notification given, the owner or operator may not proceed with the proposed\nsubstantial change in use. The owner or operator may request a hearing before the\ncommission on whether the determination should be modified or set aside by submit-\n ting a request not later than the 30th day after the receipt of the executive director's\ndetermination. If a hearing is requested, the commission shall initiate the hearing\nnot later than the 45th day after the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be\nconducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act\n(Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes). The executive director's determina-\n tion becomes unappealable on the 31st day after issuance if a hearing is not\n requested.\n   Sec. 361.187. PROPOSED REMEDIAL ACTION. (a) Within a reasonable time\nafter the completion of the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar\nstudy, if required, the executive director shall select a proposed remedial action.\nAfter the selection of a proposed remedial action, the commission shall hold a public\nmeeting to discuss the proposed action.\n                                           69\n\fCh. 10, Art. 2, § 29                 71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION\n\n   (b) The commission shall publish notice of the meeting in the Texas Register and in\na newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located at\nleast 45 days before the date of the public meeting. The notice shall provide informa-\n tion regarding the proposed remedial action and the date, time, etr.d place of the\n meeting. The commission shall also mail the same information to each potentially\n responsible party by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's last known\n address at least 45 days before the public meeting. Contemporaneously with the\nissuance of notice of thr public meeting, the executive director shall make available to\nall interested parties the public records the executive director has regarding the\nfacility. For purposes of providing this information, the executive director shall\nproiide a brief summary of those public records and make those public records\navailable for inspection and copying during regular business hours. Nonreceipt of\nany notice mailed to a potentially responsible party under this section does not affect\n the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities imposed on the party.\n   (c) The public meeting is legislative in nature and not a contested case hearing\nunder the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Ver-\nnon s Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held for the purpose of obtaining\nadditional information regarding the facility and the identification of additional\npotentially responsible parties. Those in attendance may comment on the proposed\n remedial action, and the executive director may revise the proposed remedial action\nin light of the presentations.\n   (d) After the public meeting on the proposed remedial action, the commission shall\nprovide all identified potentially responsible parties an opportunity to fund or\nperform the proposed remedial action. Not later than the 60th day after the date of\nthe public meeting, the potentially responsible parties may make a good faith offer to\nfund or perform the proposed remedial action. If a good faith offer is made by all or\nsome of the potentially responsible parties within this period, those parties have an\nadditional 60 days to negotiate an agreed administrative order from the commission,\nwhich shall include a scope of work. The commission may not require an admission\nof liability in the agreed administrative order.\n   (e) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial action,\ncosts for commission oversight of the remedial action may not be assessed against\nthose parties who fund or perform the remedial action. Nonparticipating potentially\nresponsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of the\nfacility may be assessed up to the full costs for commission oversight of the remedial\naction. If all potentially responsible parties conduct or fund the remedial action, all\ncommission oversight costs shall be paid from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.\nParticipation in the remedial action does not relieve those who did not conduct or\nfund the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar study approved by\nthe executive director from paying their portion of the oversight costs of that phase of\nthe remediation.\n   (/) The executive director may authorize a potentially responsible party to conduct\na partial remedial action at a portion of the facility if after notice and opportunity\nfor comment to all other potentially responsible parties the executive director deter-\nmines that the release or threatened release is divisible. In this subchapter, \"divisi-\nble\" means that the hazardous substance relea..cied or threatened to be released is\ncapable of being managed separately under the remedial action plan. A determina-\ntion of divisibility by the executive director does not have res judicata or collateral\nestoppel effect on a potentially responsible party's ultimate liability for remediation\nof the facility under Subchapter G or I.\n   Sec. 361.188. FINAL ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER. (a) After consideration of all\ngood faith offers to perform a remedial action, the commission shall issue a final\nadministrative order that must:\n      (1) list the facility on the state registry, thus determining that the facility poses\n   an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the\n   environment,·\n      (2) specify the selected remedial action;\n                                               70\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION                           Ch. 10, Art. 2, § 29\n    (3) list the parties determined to be responsible for remediating the facility,·\n    (4) make findings of fact describing actions voluntarily undertaken by respon-\n   sible parties,·\n      (5) order the responsible parties to remediate the facility and, if appropriate,\n   reimburse the hazardous waste disposal fee fund for remedial investigation/fea-\n   sibility study and remediation costs;\n      (6) establish a schedule for completion of the remedial action,·\n      (7) state any determination of divisibility of responsible party liability,· and\n      (8) give notice of the duties and restrictions imposed by Section 361.190.\n   (b) The provisions in Subchapters I, K, and L relating to administrative orders\napply to orders issued under this section.\n   (c) If a potentially responsible party is newly identified afte1· a final administrative\norder under Subsection (a) has been issued by the commission, that party has 60 days\n to negotiate an amendment to the existing order. The commission is not prohibited\nfrom issuing a separate order for the newly identified potentially responsible party if\n the commission determines that the circumstances warrant a separate order. The\n responsible parties identified in the order issued under Subsection (a) shall be allowed\n to com?r ·1. on the issuance of a separate order for the newly identified potentialiy\n responsitJti; party.\n   (d) Within a reasonable period after a determination has been made, the commis-\nsion shall file or cause to be filed in the real property records of the county in which\n the facility is located an affidavit or notice stating that lite facility has been listed on\nor deleted from the state registry or is no longer proposed for listing on the state\nregistriJ.\n   Sec. 361.189. DELETIONS FROM REGISTRY. (a) Any owner or operator or other\nnamed responsible party of n facility listed or to be listed on the state registry may\nrequest the commission to delete the facility from the state registry, modify the\nfacility's priority within the state registry, or modify any information regarding the\nfacility by submitting a written statement setting forth the grounds of the request in\n the form the commission may by rule require.\n   (b) The commission by rule shall establish procedures, including public hearings,\nfor review of requests submitted under this section.\n   Sec. 361.190. CHANGE IN USE OF LISTED FACILITY. (a) After the listing of a\nfacility on the state registry, a person may not substantially change the manner in\nwhich the facility is used without notifying the executive director and receiving\nwritten approval of the executive director for the change.\n   (b) A substantial change in use shall be defined by rule and shall include actions\nsuch as the erection of a building or other structure at the facility, the use of the\nfacility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility for use as a roadway or\nparking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or private recreational use on\n the facility.\n   (c) The notice must be in writing, addressed to the executive director, sent by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested, and include a brief description of the\nproposed change in use.\n   (d) The executive director shall approve or disapprove the proposed action within 60\ndays after the date of receipt of the notice of proposed change in use. The executive\ndirector may not approve the proposed change in use if the new use will significantly\ninterfere with a proposed, ongoing, or completed remedial action program at a\nfacility or expose the public health and safety or the environment to a significantly\nincreased threat of harm.\n   Sec. 361.191. IMMEDIATE REMOVAL. (a) If the commission, after investigation,\nfinds that there exists a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a\nfacility that is causing irreversible or irreparable harm to the public health and\nsafety or the environment and that the immediacy of the situation makes it preju-\n                                             71\n\fCh. I 0, Art. 2, § 29               71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION\n\ndicial to the public interest to delay action until an administrative order can be\nissued to potentially responsible parties or until a judgment can be entered in an\nappeal of an administratil'e order, the commission may, with the funds available to\nthe commission from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund, undertake immediate\nremoval action at the facility to alleviate the harm.\n   (b) After the immediate danger of irreversible or irreparable harm has been allevi-\nated, the commission shall proceed under this subchapter.\n   (c) Findings required under this section must be in writing and may be made ex\nparte by the commission subject to judicfol review under the substantial evidence rule\nas provided by the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article\n5252-13a, Venzon s Texas Civil Statutes).\n   (d) The reasonable expenses of any immediate removal action taken by the commis-\nsion may be recoverable from the persons described in Subchapter G or I, and the\nstate may seek to recover the reasonable expenses in any court of appropriate\njurisdiction.\n   Sec. 361.192. REMEDIAL ACTION BY COMMISSION. (a) If a person ordered to\neliminate an imminent and substantial endangennent to the public health and safety\nor the environment has/ailed to do so within the time limits specified in the order or\nany extension of time approved by the commission, the commission may implement\nthe remedial action program for the facility.\n   (b) The reasonable expenses of implementing the remedial action program by the\ncommission shall be paid by the persons to whom the order was issued and shall be\nrecoi•erable under Section 361.197.\n   Sec. 361.193. GOAL OF REMEDIAL ACTION. (a) The goal of any remedial action\nis the elimination of the imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health\nand safety or the environment posed by a relecu1e or threatened release of a hazardous\nsubstance at a facility. The appropriate e:>.:tent of the remedial action at any\nparticular facility shall be determined by the commissions selection of the remedial\nalternative that the commission determines is the lowest cost alternative that is\ntechnologically feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and minimizes\ndamage to and provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the\nem>ironment.\n   (b) In considering the appropriate remedial action program at a particular facility,\nthe commission may approve a program that does not attain a level or standard of\ncontrol at least equivalent to a legally applicable or relevant and appropriate\nstandard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, as required by state or local law, if\nthe commission finds that:\n      (1) the remedial action selected is only part of a total remedial action that will\n   attain that level or standard of control when completed,·\n      (2) compliance with the requirement at that facility will result in greater risk to\n   public health and safety or the environment than alternative options,·\n      (3) compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an engi-\n   neering perspective,·\n      (4) the remedial action selected will attain a standard of performa.nce that is\n   equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement,\n   criterion, or limitation through use of another method or approach,·\n      (5) uJi.th respect to a local standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, the\n   locality has not consistently applied or demonstrated the intention to consistently\n   apply the standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation in similar circumstances\n   of other remedial actions within the locality,· or\n      (6) with respect to an action using solely state funds, selection of a remedial\n   action that attain.'l those levels or standards of control will not provide a balance\n   between the need for protection of public health and safety or the environment at\n   the facility and the availability of state funds to respond to other sites that present\n                                           72\n\f7lst LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION                          Ch. 10, Art. 2, § 29\n\n    a threat to public health and safety or the environment, taking into consideration\n    the relative immediacy of the threats.\n   Sec. 361.194. LIEN. (a) In addition to all other remedies available to the state\n under this chapter or other law, all remediation costs for which a person is liable to\n the state constitute a lien in favor of the state on the real property and the rights to\n the real property that are subject to or affected by a remedial action. This provision\n is cumulative of other remedies available to the state under this chapter.\n    (b) The lien imposed by this section arises and attaches to the real property subject\n to or affected by a remedial action at the time an affidavit is recorded and indexed in\naccordance with this section in the county in which the real property is located. For\n the purpose of determining rights of all affected parties, the lien does not relate back\n to a time before the date on which the affidavit is recorded, which date is the lien\n inception date. The lien continues until the liability for tile costs is satisfied or\n becomes unenforceable through operation of law.\n    (c) An authorized representative of the commission shall execute the affidavit. The\naffidavit must show:\n       (1) the names and addresses of the persons liable for the costs;\n       (2) a description of the real property that is subject to or affected by the\n    remediation action for the costs or claims,· and\n       (3) the amount of the costs and the balance due.\n    (d) The county clerk shall record the affidavit in records kept for that purpose and\nshall index the affidavit under the names of the persons liable for the costs.\n    (e) The commission shall record a relinquishment or satisfaction of the lien when\n the lien is paid or satisfied.\n    (j) The lien may be foreclosed only on judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction\nforeclosing the lien and ordering the sale of the property subject to the lien.\n    (g) The lien imposed by this section is not valid or enforreable if real property, an\n interest in real property, or a mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance on or against\n real property is acquired before the affidavit is recorded, unless the person acquiring\n the real property, an interest in the property, or the mortgage, lien, or other\nencumbrance on the property had or reasonably should have had actual notice or\nknowledge that the real property is subject to or affected by a clean-up action or has\nknowledge that the state has incurred clean-up costs.\n   (h) If a lien is fixed or attempted to be fixed as provided by this section, the owner of\n the real property affected by the lien may file a bond to indemnify against the lien.\nThe bond must be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the real property\nsubject to the lien is located. An action to establish, enforce, or foreclose any lien or\nclaim of lien covered by the bond must be brought not later than the 30th day after the\ndate of service of notice of the bond. The bond must:\n       (1) describe the real property on which the lien is claimed,·\n       (2) refer to the lien claimed in a manner sufficient to identify it,·\n       (3) be in an amount double the amount of the lien referred to,·\n       (4) be payable to the cr>mmission,·\n       (5) be executed by the party filing the bond as principal and a corporate surety\n   authorized under the law of this state to execute the bond as surety; and\n       (6) be conditioned substantially that the principal and sureties will pay to the\n   commission the amount of the lien claimed, plus costs, if the claim is proved to be a\n    lien on the real property.\n   (i) After the bond is filed, the county clerk shall issue notice of the bond to the\nnamed obligee. A copy of the bond must be attached to the notice. The notice may be\nserved on each obligee by having a copy delivered to the obligee by any person\ncompetent to make oath of the deli-very. The original notice shall be returned to the\noffice of the county clerk, and the person making service of copy shall make an oath\non the back of the copies showing on whom and on what date the copies were served.\n                                               73\n\fCh. 10, Art. 2, § 29                71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION\n\n The county clerk shall record the bond notice and return in records kept for that\npurpose. In acquiring an interest in real property, a purchaser or lender may rely\non and is absolutely protected by the record of the bond, notice, and return.\n   (j) The commission may sue on the bond after the 30th day after the date on which\nthe notice is served but may not sue on the bond later than one year after the date on\nwhich the notice is served. The commission is entitled to recover reasonable attor-\nney's fees if the commission recovers in a suit on the lien or on the bond.\n   Sec. 361.195. PAYMENTS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FEE FUND.\n(a) Money for actions taken or to be taken by the commission in connection with the\nelimination of an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and\nsafety or the environment under this subchapter is payable directly to the commission\nfrom the hazardous waste disposal fee fund. These payments include any costs of\ninspection or sampling and laboratory analysis of wastes, soils, air, surface water,\nand groundwater done on behalf of a state agency and the costs of investigations to\nidentify and locate potentially respoMible parties.\n   (b) The commission shall seek remediation of facilities by potentially responsible\nparties before expenditure of federal or state funds for the remediations.\n   Sec. 361.196. REMEDIATION: PERMITS NOT REQUIRED; LIABILITY. (a) Po-\ntentially responsible parties shall coordinate with ongoing federal and state hazard-\nous waste programs although a state or local permit may not be required for any\nremoval or remedial action conducted on site.\n   (b) Subject to Section 361.193, the state may enforce any federal or state standard,\nrequirement, criterion, or limitation to which the remedial action would otherwise be\nrequired to conform if a permit were required.\n   (c) An action taken by the person to contain or remove a release or tiireatened\nrelease in accordance with an approved remedial action plan may not be construed as\nan admission of liability for the release or threatened release.\n   (d) A person who renders assistance in containing or removing a release or\nthreatened release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan is not liable\nfor any additional remediation costs at the facility resulting solely from acts or\nomissions of the person in rendering the assistance in compliance with the approvals\nrequired by this section, unless the remediation costs were caused by the persons gross\nnegligence or wilful misconduct.\n   (e) Except as specifically provided by this section, these provisions do not expand or\ndiminish the common law tort liability, if any, of private parties participating in a\nremediation action for civil damages to third parties.\n   Sec. 361.197. COST RECOVERY. (a) The commission shall file a cost recovery\naction against all responsible parties who have not complied with the terms of an\nadministrative order issued under Section 361.188. The commission shall file the cost\nrecovery action no later than one year after all remedial action has been completed.\n   (b) The state may seek a judgment against the noncompliant parties for the total\namount of the cost of the remedial action, including costs of any necessary studies\nand oversight costs, minus the amount agreed to be paid or expended by any other\nresponsible parties under an order issued under Section 361.188.\n   (c) The action may also include a plea seeking civil penalties for noncompliance\nwith the commission's administrative order and a claim for up to double the states\ncosts if the responsible party$ defenses are determined by the court to be unreason-\nable, frivolous, or without foundation.\n   Sec. 361.198. ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL PENALTY. (a) A responsible party\nnamed in an administrative order who does not comply with the order is subject to\nthe imposition of administrative or civil penalties under Section 361.252. The\npenalties may be assessed only from the date after which the administrative order\nbecomes nonappealable.\n   (b) Tlte commission may include provisions within an agreed administrative order\nthat stipulate administrative penalty amount..<1 for failure to comply with the order.\n                                           74\n\f7lst LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION                          Ch. 10, Art. 2, § 29\n\n The penalty provisions may be applicable to either or both the remedial investiga-\ntion/feasibility study and remedial action orders.\n   Sec. 3Sl.199. MIXED FUNDING PROGRAM. The commission by rule shall adopt\na mixed funding program in which available money from potentially responsible\nparties is combined with state or federal funds to dean up a facility in a timely\nmanner. Use of the state or federal funds in a miced funding approach does not\npreclude the state or federal government from seeking recovery of its costs from\nnonparticipating pot.mtially responsible parties.\n   Sec. 361.200. DE MIN/MIS SE'ITLEMENT. The commission shall assess and by\n rule may develop and implement a de minimis settlement program. Under the\nprogram, the commission shall consider the advantages of developing a final settle-\nment with potentially responsible parties that are responsible for only a minor\nportion of the response costs at a facility because tlte hazardous substances the party\nis responsible for are minimal in amount or in hazardous effect by comparison with\nthe hazardous substances attributable to other parties.\n   Sec. 361.201. FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND FUNDING PRIORITY.

Health & Safety Code § 361.001-.966 (West 2010)\n\n(hereinafter “SWDA”).\n\nI.   STATEMENTS OF FACTS\n\n     A. Appellant’s Statement of Facts is not Controverted\n\n     Appellant showed the steps the TCEQ took in investigating, listing,\n\npreparing to remediate the Voda Site and issuing the Order (Appellant’s\n\nBr. 1-5), in accordance with Subchapter F of the SWDA. (Appellant’s Br.\n\n23). Appellees do not contradict these facts, and they must be accepted as\n\ntrue. Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(g).\n\n     B.   Appellees’ Statement of Facts Focuses on Irrelevancies\n\n     Appellees focus on three areas in their Statement of Facts. Although\n\nnone are relevant to this appeal, the State will address them to clarify the\n\nrecord.\n\n     Appellees describe response actions by the U.S. Environmental Protec-\n\n\n\n                                      1\n\ftion Agency (“EPA”) at the Voda Site, with the implication that the TCEQ\n\nneed not have taken any further remedial action. (Appellees Br. 1-3.)\n\nHowever, Appellees ignore the fact that EPA contemplated a subsequent\n\nState-led investigation and remedial action to address soil contamination at\n\ndepth, and groundwater contamination on and migrating off of the Site.\n\n(AR 61923-24, AR 943, AR 59594-60117 and AR 60253-83.)\n\n    Second, Appellees complain that they lacked the opportunity to be\n\nheard before the Commission. (Appellees Br. 3-5.) Appellees had many\n\nopportunities to present information to the TCEQ during the 15-year\n\nSuperfund process, see Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 361.181-.188, and they\n\nsubmitted detailed input. (See, e.g., CR 910-12, with references to the\n\nadministrative record.) Appellees chose not to appear at the Commission\n\nmeeting regarding approval of the Order (AR 50382; video file), and not to\n\njoin Luminant’s Motion for Rehearing (AR 50864-89).\n\n    Finally, Appellees address the subsequent history of the appeal in the\n\nDistrict Court, with the implication that the TCEQ’s pleadings and state-\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\fments there are relevant to the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction. (Appel-\n\nlees Br. 6-8.) They are not relevant, however, because the TCEQ cannot\n\nconfer jurisdiction by such statements. (See infra at sec. V.C.1.)\n\nII. REPLY TO APPELLEES’ SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       Appellees make various conclusory statements, none of which deny\n\nthat the Order was issued under Subchapter F procedures and contained\n\nthe “laundry list” of items required of a § 361.188 order. (Appellees’ Br. 9-\n\n11.)\n\n       Appellees assert that, “Potentially responsible parties are entitled to\n\ntheir day in court.…” (Appellees’ Br. 11.) This, together with statements in\n\ntheir Statement of Facts, suggests a Due Process argument. But this inter-\n\nlocutory appeal is only about subject-matter jurisdiction. The District Court\n\ncan consider issues of equity and Due Process after this Court determines\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nIII. REPLY TO APPELLEES’ STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n       Appellees’ argument rests on an inference that a waiver of sovereign\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fimmunity anywhere in a statute applies to all causes of action (or, in this\n\ncase, appellate provisions) in the statute. To the contrary, waivers of\n\nsovereign immunity are strictly construed and must be expressed in clear\n\nand unequivocal terms. See Berry v. Tex. Democratic Party, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n640 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, no pet. h.) (citations omitted); see also Tex.\n\nGov’t Code § 311.034. Thus, a waiver limited to one action is inapplicable\n\nto other actions, even in the same statute.\n\n    Appellees argue that, “What the parties actually dispute is precisely\n\nwhat evidence the trial court may consider in reviewing the Order.… The\n\nState’s plea is not a challenge to the trial court’s subject matter jurisdic-\n\ntion.…” (Appellees’ Br. 11-12.) To the contrary, the State is asserting that,\n\nfor this type of order, the District Court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nunder § 361.321 but not under § 361.322. (Appellant’s Br. 32-38.) This is a\n\nplea to the jurisdiction, therefore, not merely a dispute over the evidence.\n\nEssentially, this Court is being asked to decide whether the District Court\n\nwill exercise its original fact-finding jurisdiction or its appellate jurisdiction\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fover the Order.\n\n    Appellees further assert that, “the State cannot maintain a plea to the\n\njurisdiction in this case because its own pleadings defeat its claim.” (Appel-\n\nlees’ Br. 12.) However, the State’s pleadings cannot confer jurisdiction by\n\nconsent, waiver or estoppel. (See sec. V.C.1, infra.)\n\nIV. REPLY CONCERNING ISSUE ONE\n\n    Appellees attempt to show that the two types of order, despite being in\n\ndifferent sections of the statute and having different elements and proce-\n\ndures, are “not mutually exclusive.” (Appellees’ Br. 14.) They reason that\n\n“both types of orders share elements outlined in Subchapters I, K, and L of\n\nthe Act, including but not limited to: … [a]n appellate provision. Id. at\n\n§ 361.322.” (Appellees’ Br. 14-15.) To the contrary, while the orders have\n\nsome elements in common (due to § 361.188(b)), they cannot both be\n\nappealed under § 361.322.\n\n    A. The plain language of § 361.322 limits that section to\n       appeals of § 361.272 orders\n\n    The plain language of the statute says that § 361.322 is limited to the\n\n\n                                       5\n\fappeals of § 361.272 orders: “Any person subject to an administrative order\n\nunder Section 361.272 may appeal the order by filing a petition.…” SWDA\n\n§ 361.322(a) (emphasis added). See also id. §§ 361.322(g) and (h) (referring to\n\n“the administrative order.”)\n\n    Conversely, § 361.321 applies generally to a “ruling, order, decision, or\n\nother act of the commission,” but contains the following exclusion: “Except\n\nas provided by Section 361.322(e) [read 361.322(g)], in an appeal from an\n\naction of the commission … the issue is whether the action is invalid,\n\narbitrary, or unreasonable.” Id. § 361.321(e). (See Appellant’s Br. 13 con-\n\ncerning the outdated reference to § 361.322(e).) Thus, the two appellate\n\nsections are separate and have different standards of review.\n\n    The fact that § 361.322 refers to § 361.272 orders, and does not mention\n\nany others, indicates that the Legislature did not intend for it to apply to\n\nany other type of order.

The language and structure of the SWDA create separate\n         orders and separate appeals\n\n         1.   The current language of the statute correctly reflects the\n              intent of the Legislature\n\n    Appellees refer to the statutory history in an attempt to show that both\n\ntypes of order have always been subject to the same appellate standards.\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 15-29.) One problem with this analysis is that what is now\n\nSubchapter F, including §§ 361.181-.188, was substantially rewritten in\n\n1989-90, and the appellate cross-references were codified at the same time.\n\n    The Legislature codified the SWDA in the Regular Session of 1989. See\n\nAct of May 18, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 678, § 1, 1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 2230,\n\n2616-64. (App. 1:2616-64.) In that same session, it enacted amendments\n\nthat were not codified. See Act of May 24, 1989, 71st Leg., R.S., ch. 703, § 5,\n\n1989 Tex. Gen. Laws 3212, 3218-32. (App. 2:3218-32.) Those amendments\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fincluded a substantial rewriting of § 13 (now Subchapter F), to the extent\n\nthat they practically created a new program. Id. (App. 2:3218-32.) The next\n\nyear, in the Sixth Called Session, the Legislature codified the new amend-\n\nments. See Act of June 6, 1990, 71st Leg., 6th C.S., ch. 10, art. 2, § 29, 1990\n\nTex. Gen. Laws 47, 66-80 (amended 1997) (current version at Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code §§ 361.181-.202). (App. 3:66-80.)\n\n    In the same act that codified the new Subchapter F, the Legislature also\n\nincorporated the uncodified amendment to § 9(b) (now § 361.322(a)) and\n\nincluded this reference: “Any person subject to an administrative order\n\nunder Section 361.272 may appeal the order by filing a petition.…” Id. § 28,\n\n1990 Tex. Gen. Laws 64-65 (current version at Tex. Health & Safety Code\n\n§ 361.322(a)). (App. 3:64-65.) They also amended § 361.321(c) with the\n\ncross-reference, “[e]xcept as provided by Section 361.322(a)....” Id. at 64\n\n(current version at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 361.321(c)).\n\n    If the Legislature had wanted § 361.188 orders to be appealed under\n\n§ 361.322, this was the perfect opportunity to say so. But they did not, and\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\finstead left § 361.188 orders to be appealed under § 361.321, the general\n\nappellate section. The relevant language has not changed in the interven-\n\ning 25 years.\n\n    The legislative intent is clear from the text, and the statutory history\n\ndoes not show a different intent before codification. The plain language\n\nshows that each separate ordering section has an independent appellate\n\nsection.\n\n           2.   The pre-codification statutory history shows separate\n                orders and separate appeals\n\n    Even if there were some ambiguity in the current text, and a review of\n\nthe statutory history were necessary, that history does not support the\n\nconclusions Appellees attempt to draw.\n\n    First, Appellees provide an extensive statutory history (Appellees’ Br.\n\n13-22), only to draw the same conclusions, as to the pre-codification\n\nstatute, that they drew regarding the current statute (compare Appellees’ Br.\n\n15 with id. at 21). That history does not alter any conclusions about the\n\nmeaning of the statute.\n\n\n                                          9\n\f    For example, after the 1985 amendments, the “preponderance of the\n\nevidence” clause of § 9(c) (now § 361.322(e)) was made applicable only to\n\n§ 8(g) (now § 361.272) orders; the “invalid, arbitrary or unreasonable”\n\nstandard of § 9 (now § 361.321) applied to all the rest (e.g., to § 361.188).\n\nThat language carries forward to the present statute. In other words, the\n\ncodifiers correctly carried forward the prior meaning to the current statute.\n\n    Appellees acknowledge that the 1989 amendments limited the applica-\n\nbility of § 9(b) (now § 361.322) appeals to “any person subject to an admin-\n\nistrative order under 8(g)” (now § 361.272). (Appellees’ Br. 21.) The same\n\nbill, they acknowledge, allowed the TCEQ to continue the remedial action\n\nprogram under § 13 (now Subchapter F), unless enjoined, and added the\n\nother provisions now found at § 361.322. (Appellees’ Br. 22.) However,\n\nthey do not acknowledge the obvious conclusion: that the pre-codified\n\nstatute, like the current version, had separate appellate provisions for the\n\ndifferent types of orders.\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f    C. Cross-references between subchapters do not merge the\n       ordering sections\n\n        1.   Section 361.188(b) merely incorporates provisions from\n             other subchapters into § 361.188 orders\n\n    Appellees argue that § 361.188 and § 361.272 orders are not mutually\n\nexclusive, although they appear in different sections and use different\n\nlanguage. (Appellees’ Br. 23.) One reason, they say, is that § 361.188(b)\n\nincorporates the provisions of Subchapters I, K and L into § 361.188 orders,\n\n“including the same appellate provisions.” (Appellees’ Br. 23-24.) This is\n\nillogical, however, since both §§ 361.321 and 361.322 are in Subchapter K—\n\nand both cannot apply to the same § 361.188 order. The difference is that\n\n§ 361.322 appeals are expressly limited to § 361.272 orders, while § 361.321\n\nappeals are applicable generally.\n\n        2.   Section 361.322(e) does not merge the orders\n\n    Appellees point out that § 361.322(e) allows the Subchapter F process\n\nto continue even after a § 361.272 order is appealed (unless enjoined).\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 24.) However, this clause does not make the orders any less\n\n\n\n                                      11\n\fseparate or distinct.\n\n    Section 361.272 orders are useful in certain circumstances:\n\n        (1) When an order is needed quickly to address exigent circum-\n    stances, and there is insufficient time to complete the exhaustive\n    Subchapter F procedures;\n\n         (2) When the remedy is fairly obvious and straightforward (such\n    as the removal of all contaminated material), because a full-blown\n    remedial investigation would be unnecessary; and\n\n         (3) When a stopgap is needed initially to stabilize the site while\n    the full Superfund process is carried out under Subchapter F.\n\n    Section 361.322(e) is designed to facilitate option (3). The fact that the\n\nTCEQ can conduct a full investigation and issue a § 361.188 order, while a\n\n§ 361.272 order is on appeal, does not make the orders any less separate or\n\ndistinct. In fact, it shows that they are separate orders.\n\n    D. The term “person affected” does not limit § 361.321 to\n       permit appeals\n\n    Appellees assert that the SWDA appellate provisions distinguish\n\nbetween Superfund and permitting orders, not between different kinds of\n\nSuperfund orders. (Appellees’ Br. 25.) The reason, they say, is that the\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\fterm “person affected” in § 361.321 limits that section to permitting ap-\n\npeals. (Appellees’ Br. 25-27.) They say, “[b]oth its statutory history and its\n\ncurrent role in the SWDA demonstrate clear legislative intent that § 361.321\n\nis the appellate provision for the permitting program, not the Superfund\n\nprogram.” (Appellees’ Br. 27, citations omitted.)\n\n    To the contrary, while it is undoubtedly true that the definition of\n\n“person affected” in § 361.003(24) applies to permitting decisions, it does\n\nnot follow that the same term in § 361.321 limits that section to the appeals\n\nof permit matters.\n\n         1.   The definition of “person affected” is broad enough to\n              cover persons named in Superfund orders\n\n    A person named in a Superfund order is affected by the order. That\n\nperson is required to be responsible for a share of the response costs\n\nincurred at the site, and thus has an economic interest in the outcome. That\n\nperson can “demonstrate[] that the person has suffered or will suffer actual\n\ninjury or economic damage,” within the meaning of id. § 361.003(24).\n\nLikewise, the person named in the Superfund order was determined to\n\n\n                                        13\n\fhave done business at the site (see definition of “Person Responsible for\n\nSolid Waste” at id. § 361.271), and was therefore “doing business … in the\n\ncounty” within the meaning of id. § 361.003(24)(B).\n\n    Definitions in the SWDA apply “unless the context requires a different\n\ndefinition.” Id. § 361.003. In context, this definition is broad enough to\n\nencompass persons named in Superfund orders, for purposes of appeals\n\nunder § 361.321.\n\n         2.   Under Appellees’ interpretation, there might be no appeal\n              for § 361.188 orders\n\n    Appeals under § 361.322 are limited, by the plain language of that\n\nsection, to orders issued under § 361.272. If § 361.321 were restricted to\n\nnon-Superfund matters, then there would be no clear, unambiguous\n\nwaiver of immunity for § 361.188 orders. Since this Order was procedurally\n\nand substantively a § 361.188 order (see Issue Two, sec. V, infra), Appellees\n\nwould have no appeal in the present case.\n\n    The TCEQ does not argue that the Legislature intended for there to be\n\nno appeal for a § 361.188 order. The most reasonable interpretation is that\n\n\n                                       14\n\f“persons affected,” in the case of a § 361.188 order, is meant to include the\n\npersons named in the order.\n\n         3.   Under Appellees’ interpretation, only permit matters and\n              § 361.272 orders could be appealed\n\n    Appellees undoubtedly overstate their argument in saying that\n\n“§ 361.321 is the appellate provision for the permitting program… .”\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 27.) In fact, § 361.321 is the general appellate provision for\n\nthe SWDA.\n\n    Matters other than permitting decisions have been appealed under\n\n§ 361.321. See, e.g., Tex. Water Comm’n v.

Conclusion\n\n    The Legislature contemplated, considered, and enacted two different\n\ntypes of administrative orders for Superfund actions. Section 361.188\n\norders are issued when the TCEQ completes the procedures set forth in\n\nSubchapter F, whereas § 361.272 orders are reserved for situations where\n\ncircumstances demand quicker action. Each order has its own independent\n\nmechanism for appeal. Appellees’ arguments that the appellate remedies\n\nset forth in § 361.321 are restricted to non-Superfund actions are erroneous.\n\nV. REPLY CONCERNING ISSUE TWO\n\n    Appellees’ response to Issue Two is notable for what it does not say. It\n\ndoes not assert that the TCEQ failed to do any of the things required under\n\n§§ 361.181-.188, or that the Order is missing any of the “laundry list” of\n\nrequirements in § 361.188. It does not contradict the facts the TCEQ set out\n\nin this regard (Appellant’s Br. 1-5). The TCEQ asserts that this is a § 361.188\n\norder because it was issued in accordance with all the procedural and\n\n\n\n                                      16\n\fsubstantive requirements of Subchapter F of the SWDA. Appellees do not\n\ncontrovert this argument.\n\n    Appellees’ argument is otherwise, and somewhat contradictory. First,\n\nthey assert that the Order “was issued under both § 361.188 and § 361.272\n\nof the SWDA.” (Appellees’ Br. 29.) Then they say, “the AO for the Voda\n\nSite was issued under § 361.272, making application of § 361.322 appropri-\n\nate for this Order.” (Appellees’ Br. 30.)\n\n    Their reasoning depends on two arguments: First, that the TCEQ made\n\nvarious statements, both at the agency level and before the District Court,\n\nto the effect that the Order was issued under both sections. Second, they\n\nsay that certain provisions of Subchapters I, K and L have been incorpo-\n\nrated into the Order pursuant to § 361.188(b), and this converts the Order\n\nto a § 361.272 order. However, neither of these arguments challenges the\n\nessential nature of the Order or affects the subject-matter jurisdiction of the\n\ncourts.\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f    A. The content of the Order shows that it was issued under\n       Subchapter F\n\n    Appellees assert that several parts of the Order incorporate authorities\n\nfrom subchapters other that Subchapter F. (Appellees’ Br. 30.) These\n\ninclude the definition of “solid waste” as well as “hazardous substances”\n\namong the materials at the Site, the definition of “responsible parties,” the\n\ndivisibility of the release, the list of Chemicals of Concern, etc. (Appellees’\n\nBr. 30-32.) They conclude that “these provisions flatly contradict the\n\nState’s position that the AO was issued solely under § 361.188.” (Appellees’\n\nBr. 31.)\n\n    This argument, however, ignores the language of § 361.188(b)—that\n\n“[t]he provisions in Subchapters I, K, and L relating to administrative\n\norders apply to orders issued under this section.” SWDA § 361.188(b).\n\nAppellees have admitted that this clause “is open ended and inclusive, and\n\ndemonstrates that the Legislature intended all ‘administrative orders’ of\n\nthe SWDA to share common procedural attributes.…” (Appellees’ Br. 24.)\n\nThe fact that § 361.188(b) incorporates elements from other subchapters\n\n\n                                       18\n\fdoes not turn the Order into a § 361.272 order.\n\n    B.   Contrary statements did not change the essential nature of\n         the Order\n\n    Appellees refer to various statements by the TCEQ to the effect that the\n\nOrder was issued under both sections. These statements all relate back to a\n\nboilerplate clause in the preamble to the Order itself, which said that the\n\nExecutive Director’s requested relief included a Superfund order “as\n\nauthorized by Sections 361.188 and 361.272 of the Act.” (AR 50383.)\n\n    Prior to the Supreme Court’s opinion in City of Waco, Texas case law\n\nheld that, “substantial-evidence review on an agency record is simply ‘not\n\npossible’ absent the opportunity to develop that record through a con-\n\ntested-case or adjudicative hearing.” City of Waco v. Tex. Comm’n on Envtl.\n\nQuality, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2547102\"><a href=\"/opinion/2547102/city-of-waco-v-comn-on-envtl-quality/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (Tex. App.—Austin 2011), rev’d, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">409</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2013). The parties believed that, if the matter were appealed,\n\nsome judicial fact-finding was inevitable in the trial court. The agenda\n\nnotice and the statement by the staff attorney simply reflected the boiler-\n\nplate in the preamble to the Order, and were not statements about the\n\n\n                                     19\n\fanticipated standard of review on appeal. In presenting the Order to the\n\nCommission, the staff attorney summarized the actions the TCEQ took in\n\ncompliance with the Subchapter F program. (AR 50382; video file, oral\n\nstatement at 1:18.)\n\n    The TCEQ’s statement in its Reply to Luminant’s Motion for Rehearing\n\n(concerning the lack of need for an adjudicative hearing) did not affect\n\nsubstantive rights. (See Appellees’ Br. 32-33; AR 49650.) The TCEQ rea-\n\nsoned that no hearing was required for a § 361.272 order, by virtue of Tex.\n\nHealth & Safety Code § 361.274—however, no hearing was required for\n\neither type of order. (AR 49650.) The TCEQ was not saying that a hearing\n\nwas precluded by the combined effects of both ordering sections, simply\n\nthat no hearing was required under either section. Substantive rights were\n\nnot affected by any assertion about the Order being issued under both\n\nsections.\n\n    The TCEQ cannot waive sovereign immunity though its own state-\n\nments. (See sec. V.C.1, infra.) The Order is defined by its substance and the\n\n\n\n                                      20\n\fprocedures used to create it, and the Appellees do not contest that it has all\n\nthe characteristics of a § 361.188 order. It follows from the plain language\n\nof the statute that appeal is under § 361.321. The TCEQ lacks the power to\n\nwaive sovereign immunity and admit that the Order is something that it is\n\nnot, or that appeal is proper under a different section.\n\n    C. The State’s prior pleadings did not waive, agree to, or confer\n       jurisdiction\n\n    Appellees refer to various pleadings and agreed judgments in which\n\nthe State said that the Order was issued under both §§ 361.188 and 361.272.\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 33-34.) However, the State’s prior pleadings cannot defeat\n\nthis plea.\n\n         1.

Prior judgments and motions did not create waivers of\n              sovereign immunity\n\n    Appellees refer to two agreed final judgments and two motions for\n\ndefault judgment, which recited that the Order was issued under both\n\nsections. (Appellees’ Br. 34-35.) However, Appellees do not say how the\n\nparties to those judgments were affected by those statements, nor how\n\nAppellees themselves were affected. In fact, those statements simply\n\nreflected the boilerplate statement in the preamble to the Order. The scope\n\nand type of order, and the appellate provisions applicable to each type of\n\norder, were not at issue in any of those proceedings.\n\n    Neither the identity of the Order nor the language it contains has ever\n\nbeen in dispute. In the agreed final judgments, all causes of action related\n\nto the Order were being compromised and settled. (The judgments were\n\nsevered and filed in separate cases. However, the text of each can be seen\n\n\n                                       23\n\fwith the TCEQ’s notices of lodging. (See CR 275-436, 458-556.)) All claims\n\nrelated to the Order were being dismissed. Neither the settling parties’ nor\n\nAppellees’ rights were affected by the boilerplate statements.\n\n    Appellees also refer to a statement in the TCEQ’s Third Amended\n\nOriginal Answer that the “sole method for appealing the Order” is at Tex.\n\nHealth & Safety Code § 361.322. (Appellees’ Br. 35, CR 678.) That state-\n\nment was in the context of a plea to the jurisdiction seeking to dismiss a\n\nclaim under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act on the grounds of\n\nredundancy. (CR 677-79.) The motion should have said that the “sole\n\nmethod” of appeal was under § 361.321. However, the underlying argu-\n\nment was still sound—that the UDJA action offered nothing but redundant\n\nremedies. In context, the statement did not draw a distinction between two\n\ndifferent sections of the SWDA, but between remedies offered in the UDJA\n\nversus the SWDA. Moreover, the statement did not create a waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity.\n\n    If any party’s pleadings are to be binding, it is those of Appellees—\n\n\n\n                                     24\n\fwho expressly limited their prayer for relief to whether “the TCEQ’s\n\nAdministrative Order is invalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable and therefore\n\nmust be overturned pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code § 361.321(e).”\n\n(CR 25.)\n\n           3.   The State did not seek to obtain the advantages of a\n                § 361.272 order by saying that it issued the Order under\n                both sections\n\n    Appellees assert that, “the Commission invoked § 361.272 in an\n\nattempt to hold the [potentially responsible parties (“PRP’s”)] for the Voda\n\nSite jointly and severally liable under the SWDA.” (Appellees’ Br. 37.) To\n\nthe contrary, the TCEQ did not invoke § 361.272 for that reason, because it\n\nwas not necessary to do so. Section 361.276 (“Apportionment of Liability”)\n\nis made applicable to § 361.188 orders by virtue of § 361.188(b). The fact\n\nthat the TCEQ asserted there is joint and several liability for this Order\n\ndoes not make it a § 361.272 order.\n\n    D. Section 361.322(e) does not merge § 361.188 and § 361.272\n       orders\n\n    Appellees say that, “the issuance of an order under § 361.272 does not\n\n\n                                         25\n\fpreclude the Commission from the listing process of § 361.181-188.” (Ap-\n\npellees’ Br. 37, citing § 361.322(e).) While this is true, it does not lead to the\n\nconclusion that the ordering sections are somehow merged. (See discussion\n\nof § 361.322(e) at sec. IV.C.2, supra.)\n\n    The TCEQ may work through the Subchapter F process, and even\n\nissue a § 361.188 order, after the issuance and appeal of a § 361.272 order.\n\nAppellees imply that this has some relevance to the current situation, but it\n\ndoes not. In the present case, the TCEQ did the Subchapter F process first,\n\nand then issued the § 361.188 Order. Section 361.322(e) is irrelevant.\n\n    E.   Reviewing this Order under § 361.322 would make\n         Subchapter F redundant\n\n    In a trial court brief, the TCEQ asserted that “[r]eview under Section\n\n361.322 would render Subchapter F redundant.” (CR 1091.) The reason\n\nwas that the TCEQ would not go through the “elaborate, time-consuming\n\nand expensive,” Subchapter F process if it had to re-prove liability at trial\n\nby preponderance of the evidence anyway. (CR 1092.) “That practical\n\nconsideration would turn Subchapter F into surplusage, which would be\n\n\n                                          26\n\fcontrary to the intent of the Legislature.” Id. In the present case, it would\n\nmean that the TCEQ had wasted 15 years, and a lot of money, establishing\n\nfindings that would have to be re-established by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\n\n    Appellees do not address this argument directly. Instead, they respond\n\nby complaining that they were not offered a contested-case hearing before\n\nthe agency, and did not have the opportunity to show that they were not\n\n“persons responsible for solid waste.” (Appellees’ Br. 38-39.) However,\n\nAppellees had numerous opportunities to show that they were not PRP’s\n\nand present other information to the TCEQ. The Legislature did not\n\nprovide a redundant contested-case hearing as part of that process.\n\n    Appellees do not address the question of subject-matter jurisdiction;\n\ninstead, they complain about the supposed effects of a substantial evidence\n\nreview. When they suggest that the Order will be “the final word on\n\nliability,” (Appellees’ Br. 39), they grossly overstate the applicable standard\n\nof review. Appellees’ arguments about their own liability are premature in\n\n\n\n                                      27\n\fthis interlocutory appeal.\n\n    Further, their distinction between agency expertise on liability versus\n\nremedy selection is misplaced. (See Appellees’ Br. 38-39.) Essentially, they\n\nare saying that they question the agency’s expertise when it comes to\n\ndetermining their own liability. However, the agency has expertise in\n\ndetermining PRP status; it must go through the relevant procedures set out\n\nin Subchapter F, and did so for this Order in detail. (AR 12512-16706.)\n\n    F.   The Order was properly issued under § 361.188\n\n    The TCEQ asserted that: “[a] single order cannot arise under both\n\nSections 361.188 and 361.272.” (Appellant’s Br. 18.) The rationale was that,\n\n“[t]he orders must be separate and distinct because they have different\n\ndeadlines for appeal,” and “each appellate section provides for a different\n\nstandard of review.” Id.\n\n    From this, Appellants illogically conclude that the remedy is “to\n\noverturn the Order as a violation of law.” (Appellees’ Br. 40.) They arrive\n\nat this conclusion only by assuming that the TCEQ issued the Order\n\n\n\n                                     28\n\f“under both § 361.188 and § 361.272.” (Appellees’ Br. 41.) Since that is the\n\nmatter in controversy, their argument lacks logic and must fail. This Order\n\nwas properly issued under § 361.188—not § 361.272, and not both.\n\n    G. Conclusion\n\n    The TCEQ’s boilerplate language in the preamble to the Order is not\n\ncontrolling or dispositive as to the nature of the Order, nor are the TCEQ’s\n\nstatements or pleadings. What is controlling is the substance of the Order\n\nand the process the TCEQ followed leading up to its entry. Appellees do\n\nnot dispute that the TCEQ completed the procedures set forth in Sub-\n\nchapter F. If the TCEQ had intended to issue a § 361.272 order, it would\n\nhave done so early in the process rather than at the end. The Order was\n\nproperly issued under § 361.188 and is properly reviewed under § 361.321.\n\nVI. REPLY CONCERNING ISSUE THREE\n\n    The TCEQ asserted that “[b]ecause of the doctrine of Sovereign Immu-\n\nnity, the courts lack jurisdiction to review the Order under any section\n\nother than Section 361.321.” (Appellant’s Br. 32.) The premises of that\n\n\n\n                                     29\n\fargument were that (a) the ordering sections are mutually exclusive, and\n\n(b) this Order was issued under § 361.188. (Appellant’s Br. 32.)\n\n    Appellees respond that “[j]udicial review of the Administrative Order\n\nfor the Voda Site is constitutional and appropriate under § 361.322 of the\n\n[SWDA].” (Appellees’ Br. -ix-.) However, they start with different pre-\n\nmises. They posit that “the substantial evidence review procedures found\n\nin the APA are not applicable to this appeal” (Appellees’ Br. 41), and then\n\nargue that “judicial review under § 361.322 does not violate the separation\n\nof powers doctrine.” (Appellees’ Br. 42.)\n\n    In other words, Appellees are saying that an order issued under\n\n§ 361.272 is properly appealed under § 361.322, and there is no constitu-\n\ntional impediment to doing so. Even assuming that argument to be sound,\n\nit is irrelevant here because the present case involves a § 361.188 order—as\n\nestablished in Issues One and Two, above. Appellees do not controvert the\n\nessence of the TCEQ’s jurisdictional argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                     30\n\f       A. The constitutionality of § 361.322 is not at issue\n\n           1.   Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.174 restates existing law\n\n       The TCEQ asserted that “[u]nder the Separation of Powers Doctrine,\n\nthe courts review administrative orders only as to matters of law.” (Appel-\n\nlant’s Br. 35.) That was in the context of an argument showing that the\n\nTexas Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) (specifically, Tex. Gov’t\n\nCode § 2001.174) codified the Legislature’s understanding of the existing\n\nlaw of judicial review of state agency actions. (Appellant’s Br. 35-37.)\n\n       Appellees do not controvert the proposition that Tex. Gov’t Code\n\n§ 2001.174 restated existing law. Instead, they argued that “the separation\n\nof powers doctrine only prohibits the Legislature from authorizing de novo\n\njudicial review of quasi-legislative acts that address broad questions of\n\npublic policy or promulgate rules for future application.” (Appellees’ Br.\n\n42.)\n\n       However, issues concerning the constitutionality of the “preponder-\n\nance of the evidence” requirement in § 361.322(g) are irrelevant here. Given\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fthat this Order was issued under § 361.188, it is properly reviewed under\n\nthe “invalid, arbitrary or unreasonable” standard of § 361.321(e). (See also,\n\nargument and authorities at sec. VI.C.1, infra.)\n\n    Appellees cite cases in which statutes required trials de novo for\n\ncertain agency decisions. (Appellees’ Br. 43-46, citing Commercial Life Ins.\n\nCo. v. Tex.

See Commercial Life, 808\n\nS.W.2d at 554-55; Macias, 995 S.W.2d at 832-33. Again, however, that is\n\nirrelevant here because § 361.321 does not require a trial de novo.\n\n    Meanwhile, in the present case, the TCEQ has shown that the review\n\nof this Order under the “invalid, arbitrary or unreasonable” standard of\n\n§ 361.321(e) is conducted in the same manner as review under the provi-\n\nsions of Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.174. (Appellant’s Br. 37-38.)\n\n\n\n\n                                      32\n\f         2.   The Legislature’s decision to allow the review of this\n              § 361.188 order under the “invalid, arbitrary or unreason-\n              able” standard is consistent with the emerging law in this\n              area\n\n    The issue in this interlocutory appeal is whether the courts have\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to consider an appeal of an agency order under\n\none section of a statute, when the only proper appeal is under a different\n\nsection. This raises a question of Sovereign Immunity, since the State has\n\nnot waived its immunity generally. Each waiver must be in “express and\n\nunequivocal terms.” See Berry, 449 S.W.3d at 640, quoting Prairie View A&M\n\nUniv. v.

That distinction is still\n\nvalid.\n\n    B.     The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco is\n           pertinent to this SWDA appeal\n\n    The TCEQ asserted that “[a] contested case hearing is not required for\n\nreview of this Order under substantial evidence,” referring to the Supreme\n\nCourt’s City of Waco decision. (Appellant’s Br. 38-39, citing Tex. Comm’n on\n\n\n                                       34\n\fEnvtl. Quality v.

Appellees\n\nresponded that “[t]he Texas Supreme Court’s decision in City of Waco is not\n\ncontrolling in this SWDA appeal.” (Appellees’ Br. 48.) To the contrary, the\n\nSupreme Courts rulings in that case—and this Court’s subsequent applica-\n\ntions of those rulings—define the proper approach here.\n\n         1.   City of Waco did not merely make a “threshhold determina-\n              tion”\n\n    Appellees would limit the applicability of City of Waco by saying that\n\nthe case “is limited to a threshold determination of whether a third-party\n\nseeking to intervene in a permitting case is an ‘affected person’ sufficient to\n\ntrigger a contested-case hearing.” (Appellees’ Br. 10, 48.) However, that\n\nwas not the relevant characteristic of the case. The case actually turned on\n\nthe finding that the amended permit would not “significantly increase or\n\nmaterially change the authorized discharge of waste” and would therefore\n\nqualify for a statutory exemption from the contested-case requirement. City\n\nof Waco, 413 S.W.3d at 424-25 (Tex. 2013). The TCEQ made a fact-based\n\ndetermination from the information, evidence, documents, and arguments\n\n\n                                      35\n\fthat interested parties presented to the agency, and the Court upheld that\n\ndetermination. Id. (“We conclude that there is evidence in the record to\n\nsupport the Commission’s determination.…”) In the present case, the\n\nTCEQ made a similar determination respecting the Site remedy and Appel-\n\nlees’ status as PRP’s.\n\n    In City of Waco, the Texas Supreme Court upheld TCEQ’s decision\n\nbecause there was reasonable support in the agency record for the decision.\n\nId. at 424-25. Ultimately, that is what the TCEQ is requesting in the present\n\ncase. When applying the Supreme Court’s holding and analysis, this Court\n\nhas recognized that an agency’s decision is often found not to be arbitrary\n\nor capricious if the factual basis for the decision is supported by substantial\n\nevidence in the agency record. See Tex. Comm’n on Envtl. Quality v. Sierra\n\nClub, No. 03-12-00335-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7464085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *5 (Tex. App.—Austin Dec.\n\n30, 2014, no pet. h.)\n\n    Appellees attempt to distinguish City of Waco by saying that, “the\n\npresent case has no connection to the Texas Water Code, permitting, or the\n\n\n\n                                      36\n\fstanding of third parties.…” (Appellees’ Br. 51.) However, these distinc-\n\ntions are irrelevant. Appellees are still making the assumption that the\n\n“preponderance of the evidence” burden of proof applies. (Appellees’ Br.\n\n51.) But it does not, and such analysis is beside the point. After City of\n\nWaco, the courts can review an agency order by the “abuse of discretion”\n\nstandard (including the substantial evidence component), even in the\n\nabsence of a contested case or adjudicative hearing below. The relevant\n\nprovision, § 361.321, mandates such a standard of review. That is the\n\nholding and the relevance of City of Waco.\n\n    Appellees attempt to distinguish the recent Sierra Club case, which\n\nfollows the City of Waco precedent. (See Appellees’ Br. 52-53, citing Sierra\n\nClub, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7464085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Appellees admit that, “[a]pplying the holding\n\nfrom City of Waco, [this Court] held it must review ‘a TCEQ determination\n\nregarding affected-person status for an abuse of discretion.’” (Appellees’\n\nBr. 52, citing Sierra Club, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7464085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *4.) Appellees do not say why\n\nthat case is distinguishable from the present case—presumably because it\n\n\n\n                                      37\n\finvolves party standing in a permit matter. But this Court cited City of\n\nWaco throughout the opinion and noted that, “[i]n making a decision\n\nregarding affected-person status, TCEQ enjoys the discretion to weigh and\n\nresolve matters that may go to the merits of the underlying application.…”\n\nSierra Club, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7464085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *5, citing Sierra Club v. Tex. Comm’n on\n\nEnvtl. Quality, No. 03–11–00102–CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7463875</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *12 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin Dec. 30, 2014, no pet. h.) (other citations omitted).\n\n    To summarize, this Court has recently considered two different TCEQ\n\ndecisions—each within the agency’s discretion, on the substance of the\n\napplications, without contested case hearings—and reviewed them on the\n\nadministrative record based on the abuse of discretion standard. These\n\nprecedents support the TCEQ’s interpretation of City of Waco.\n\n    Finally, Appellees mischaracterize the State’s position as saying that\n\n“all TCEQ decisions—including those with specific statutory appellate\n\nprovisions to the contrary—are subject to review only through pure\n\nsubstantial evidence.” (Appellees’ Br. 53.) By contrast, the State’s actual\n\n\n\n                                      38\n\fposition is that City of Waco and its progeny allow a substantial evidence\n\nreview on appeal, even without a contested case hearing before the agency,\n\nwhen the relevant statute provides for such review. That is entirely consis-\n\ntent with precedent, and describes the present situation.\n\n    C. The “invalid, arbitrary or unreasonable” standard of\n       § 361.321(e) equates to the standard of Tex. Gov’t Code\n       § 2001.174\n\n        1.   Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.174 was intended to be a restate-\n             ment of the law\n\n    Appellees argue that the provisions of the APA contained at Tex.\n\nGov’t Code § 2001.174 do not apply here, because of the express terms of\n\nthat section. (Appellees’ Br. 53-54.) But this ignores the TCEQ’s actual\n\nargument: that the Legislature intended the APA to be a restatement of\n\nexisting law, not a new form of judicial review of agency actions. (Appel-\n\nlant’s Br. 36.) Following this argument, the “invalid, arbitrary or unreason-\n\nable” standard of § 361.321(e) simply means that the Order must be re-\n\nviewed under the standards of APA § 2001.174, of which substantial\n\nevidence is an important part. (Appellant’s Br. 37.) Appellees do not\n\n\n                                      39\n\fcontrovert the TCEQ’s actual argument.\n\n         2.   Review under the substantial evidence standard does not\n              require a contested case hearing\n\n    Appellees argue that “Outside of threshold standing questions, pure\n\nsubstantial evidence requires a true contested-case record under the APA.”\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 55-59.) However, they cite several cases that have been\n\neffectively overruled. One is Ramirez v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1687246\"><a href=\"/opinion/1687246/ramirez-v-state-bd-of-medical-exam/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 773 (Tex. App.—Austin 1996, no writ), which rejected the\n\nargument that the Legislature created a right of judicial review under the\n\nsubstantial evidence rule while depriving parties of an opportunity for a\n\ncontested case hearing. However, that case was cited in this Court’s\n\nopinion in City of Waco, 346 S.W.3d at 818, and was thus effectively over-\n\nruled by the Supreme Court’s subsequent opinion. (See Appellant’s argu-\n\nment at CR 1099-1100.)\n\n    Appellees also cite Tex. Dep’t of Ins. v. State Farm Lloyds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1875336\"><a href=\"/opinion/1875336/texas-dept-of-ins-v-state-farm-lloyds/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245 (Tex.

Like Ramirez, that case has been effectively overruled\n\nby City of Waco.\n\n    Appellees then cite G.E. Am. Commc’n v. Galveston Cent. Appraisal Dist.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416685\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416685/ge-american-communication-v-galveston-cent-appraisal-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.), and\n\nquote: “Substantial evidence review cannot have been the proper standard\n\nbecause there is no record from the appraisal review board hearing.”\n\n(Appellees’ Br. 56.) The Fourteenth Court of Appeals concluded that,\n\nbecause there was no record to review, the correct standard of review was\n\nsubstantial evidence de novo—so that the court could create a record. G.E.\n\nAm., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. However, substantial evidence de novo has been\n\nrejected by this Court as the default standard of review. See Gilder v. Meno,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758563\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758563/gilder-v-meno/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 361 (Tex. App.—Austin 1996, writ denied). In addition, like\n\nthe Ramirez case, the holding has been effectively overruled by the Su-\n\npreme Court in City of Waco. Finally, the TCEQ has compiled an exhaustive\n\nrecord in this case, and thus the rationale of G.E. American does not apply.\n\nG.E. American is simply not a good precedent here. (See CR 1101.)\n\n\n\n                                     41\n\f    Appellees attempt to distinguish various cases that are, in fact, good\n\nlaw. See, e.g., Smith v. Houston Chem. Servs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2410907/smith-v-houston-chemical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 n.2\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1994, writ denied). Smith interprets § 361.321—the\n\nsame section that defines the standard of review in the present case—and\n\nfound that the language of § 361.321(e) implies substantial evidence review\n\nunder the provisions of § 2001.174 of the APA. Smith is on point because it\n\ninterprets the exact section that is at issue in the present case. Smith, 872\n\nS.W.2d at 257 n.2 (“To render [this statute] understandable, and to protect\n\nagainst its possible violation of the separation-of-powers mandate of the\n\nConstitution of the State of Texas, we construe subsection (a) [of § 361.321]\n\nas authorizing suits for judicial review in a district court of Travis County\n\nin accordance with APA § 2001.001-.902.).\n\n    Appellees also argue that the Kelsoe case was not decided on substan-\n\ntive grounds. (Appellees’ Br. 57, citing Tex. Comm’n on Envtl. Quality v.\n\nKelsoe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743830\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743830/comn-on-environmental-quality-v-kelsoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 97 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, pet. denied) (petitioner\n\nasserted that “section 361.321 of the health and safety code only appl[ies]\n\n\n\n                                       42\n\fafter a contested case hearing, but the plain language of the statute[] does\n\nnot support that conclusion; the statute[] speak[s] of seeking review of any\n\n‘ruling, order, decision, or other act.’”). Kelsoe, 286 S.W.3d at 95. Even so,\n\nthe case shows this Court’s recent interpretation of the section that is at\n\nissue here; thus, it has precedential value.\n\n    Smith and Kelso are not distinguishable on the basis of contested case\n\nhearing because those appeals were filed under the broad language of\n\n§ 361.321.\n\n    Appellees attempt to distinguish United Copper Indus., Inc. v. Grissom,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1561404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1561404/united-copper-industries-inc-v-grissom/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. dism’d), principally on the\n\ngrounds that it is limited to “affected person” issues. (Appellees’ Br. 57-\n\n58.) However, the TCEQ cited that case for various propositions—\n\nprincipally, that “the APA, interpreting existing law, supports the proposi-\n\ntion that the Order must [be] reviewed under the substantial evidence\n\nstandard.” (Appellant’s Br. 37.) This is a general interpretation of the\n\nstatute, and is not limited to issues of party status.\n\n\n\n                                       43\n\fVII.       CONCLUSION\n\n       Appellant has shown that there are two separate ordering provisions\n\nwithin the SWDA, and that each has a separate appellate provision. The\n\nproposition that these sections are merged is not supported by the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute, its history, or by case law.\n\n       Appellees essentially admit that the order was procedurally and\n\nsubstantively issued under § 361.188, but then argue that it was also issued\n\nunder § 361.272 because those sections were merged. This proposition is\n\nlikewise unsupported by statutory interpretation or existing precedents.\n\n       Given that this Order was issued under § 361.188, and that the statute\n\nprovides for appeal under § 361.321, it follows that appeal under any other\n\nsection is beyond the subject-matter jurisdiction of the courts. This conclu-\n\nsion is entirely consistent with emerging precedents in administrative law.\n\nVIII.

(a) A person responsible for solid waste under Section\n361.271 is liable under Section 361.272 or 361.273 unless the person can establish by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the release or threatened release was caused solely\nby:\n      (1) an act of God;\n      (2) an act of war;\n      (3) an act or omission of a third person; or\n      (4) any combination of Subdivisions (1), (2), and (3).\n   (b) In a defense under Subsection (a)(3), the defendant must establish by a preponder-\nance of the evidence that the defendant:\n      (1) exercised due care concerning the solid waste, considering the characteristics of\n   the solid waste, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances; and\n      (2) took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissiuns of the third person and the\n   consequences that could foreseeably result from those acts or omissions.\n   (c) The defense under Subsection (a)(3) does not apply if the third person:\n      (1) is an employee or agent of the defendant; or\n      (2) has a direct or indirect contractual relationship with the defendant and the act or\n   omission of the third person occurred in connection with the contractual relationship.\n   (d) In Subsection (c)(2), \"contractual relationship\" includes land contracts, deeds, or\nother instruments transferring title or possession of real property.\n   (e) A defendant who enters into a contractual relationship as provided by Subsection\n(c)(2) is not liable under this subchapter if:\n      (1) the sole contractual relationship is acceptance for rail carriage by a common\n   carrier under a published tariff; or\n      (2) the defendant acquired the real property on which the facility requiring the\n   remedial action is located, after the disposal or placement of the hazardous substance\n   on, in, or at the facility and the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the\n   evidence that:\n         (A) the defendant has satisfied Subsection (b);\n         (B) at the time the defendant acquired the facility the defendant did not know and\n      had no reason to know that a hazaJ'dous substance that is the subject of the release\n      or threatened release was disposed of on, in, or at the facility;\n         (C) the defendant is a governme1.tal entity that acquired the facility by escheat, by\n      othE:r involuntary transfer or acquisition, or by the exercise of the power of eminent\n      domain; or\n         (D) the defendant acquired the facili~ by inheritance or bequest.\n   (f) To demonstrate the condition under Subsection (e)(2)(B), the defendant must have\nmade, at the time of acquisition, appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses\nof the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice in an effort to\nminimize liability. In deciding whether the defendant meets this condition, the court shall\nconsider:\n      (1) any specialized knowledge or experience of the defendant;\n      (2) the relationship of the purchase price to the valu~ ~ the property if the propert;1\n   were uncontaminated;\n      (3) commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property;\n                                            2659\n\fCh. 678, § 1                                7lst LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\nt 381.275\n      (4) the obvious presence or likely presence of contamination of the property; and\n      (5) the defendant's ability to detect the contamination by appropriate inspection.\n   (g) This section does not decrease the liability of a previous owner or operator of a\nfacility who is liable under this chapter. If the defendant obtained actual knowledge of the\nrelease or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility at the time the\ndefendant owned the real property on which the facility is loca4!d and subsequently\ntransferred ownership of the property to another person without disclosing that knowl-\nedge, the defendant is liable and a defense under this section is not available to the\ndefendant.\n   (h) Subsections (e)-(g) do not affect the liability under this chapter of a defendant who,\nby an act or omission, caused or contributed to the release or threatened release of a\nhazardous substance that is the subject of the action concerning the facility. (V.A.C.S.\nArt. 4477-7, Secs. 8(g)(3), (6).)\n   Sec. 361.276. APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILiTY. (a) If the release or threatened\nrelease caused by a person's acts or omissions is proved by a preponderance of the\nevidence to be divisible, that person is liable only for the elimination of, that release or\nthreatened release attributable to the person. If the release or threatened release is not\nproved to be divisible, persons liable under Section 361.272 or 361.273 are jointly and\nseverally liable for eliminating the release or threatened release.\n   (b) In this section, \"divisible\" means that the waste released or threatened to be\nreleased has been and is capable of being managed separately under the remedial action\nplan~ (V.A.C.S. Art. 4477-7, Sec. 8(g)(4).)\n   Sec. 361.277. JUDGMENT BY STATE AGAINST NONSETTLING PARTY; ACTION\nFOR CONTRIBUTION BY NONSETTLING PARTY. (a) If fewer than all of the persons\nidentified as liable under this subchapter agree with the state to take remedial action to\nabate an actual or threatened release of solid waste that is an imminent and substantial\nendangerment to the public health and safety or the environment under an administrative\norder issued under Section 361.272 or an action filed by the state under this subchapter,\nthe state may seek a jud~ment against a nonsettling person for the total amount of the\ncost of the remedial action minus that amount the settling persons agree to pay or spend.\n   (b) In an action for contribution brought by a nonsettling person against a settling\nperson, the nonsettling person has the burden to prove that the amount of cleanup costs\nthat a settling person agreed to pay under an agreement with the state is unreasonable\nconsidering the factors under Section 361.343 and the need to undertake timely cleanup\naction concerning the release or threatened release. (V.A.C.S. Art. 4477-7, Sec. 8(g)(5).)\n   Sec. 361.278. LIABILITY OF ENGINEER OR CONTRACTOR. (a) An engineer or\ncontractor performing a program of remedial action or cleanup of hazardous waste or\naolid waste under a contract with a state agency or political subdivision of the state is\nliable under this subchapter for any negligent act' or omission or for wilful misconduct\nthat results in an actual or threatened release of hazardous waste or solid waste after the\nabandonment or conclusion of the program only to the extent that the endangerment to\npublic health and safety or the environment is aggravated as a result of the act, omission,\nor misconduct.\n   (b) In this section, \"engineer or contractor\" means a person, including the employee or\nsubcontractor of the person, who performs a contract for evaluation, planning, designing,\nengineering, construction, equipment, or auxiliary services in connection w.ith:·\n      (1) identifying a hazardous or solid waste site;\n      (2) developing a plan to clean up the site; or                          .\n                                                                              l  '\n      (3) supervising or implementing the plan to clean up the site.

The com mis·\nsion may use the money credited to the account from interest received from the\ninvestment of the fund for only those purposes specified in Subsection (d) of this\nsection.\n   (d) The commission may use the money collected and deposited in the fund under\nSubsection (c) of this section only for:\n      (1) necessary and appropriate removal and remedial action at sites at which solid\n   [hazardGus] waste or hazardous substances have been disposed if funds from a liable\n   party, independent third party, or the federal government are not sufficient for the\n   removal or remedial action;\n      (2) necessary and appropriate maintenance of removal and remedial actions for the\n   expected life of those actions if funds from a liable party have been collected and\n   deposited in the fund for that purpose or if funds from a liable party, Independent third\n   party, or the federal government are not sufficient for the maintenance; and\n      (3) expenses related to complying with the federal Comprehensive Environmental\n   Response, Compensation, and Liabilit.y Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq.), the\n   federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, and Sections 8(g) and\n   13 of this Act.                                                                     ·\n   SECTION 5. Section 13, Solid Waste Disposal Act (Article 4477-7, Vernon's Texas\nCivil Statutes), is revised to read as follows:\n   Sec. 13. IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, AND CLEANUP OF HAZARDOUS\nWASTE FACILITIES. (a) The commission shall annually publish an updated state\nregistry identifying, to the extent feasible, every facility that may constitute an\nimminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the environ·\nment due to a release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environ·\n                                           3218\n\f71et LEGISLATURE-REGULAU SESSION                                           Ch. 703, § 5\n ment. The registry shall identify the relative priority for action at each listed\nfacility. The relative priority for action at facilities listtd on the registry shall be\n periodically reviewed and revised by the commission, as necessary to accurately\n reflect the need/or action at the facilities. For thtJ purposes of this section, \"facility\"\n means (1) any building, structure, installation, equipment, pipe, or pipeline (includ-\ning any pipe into a sewer or publicly owned treatment works, well, pit, pond, lagoon,\nimpoundment, ditch, landfill, storage container, motor vehicle, rolling stock, or\naircraft), or (2) any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited,\nstored, disposed of, or placed or otherwise come to be located,· but does not include\n any consumer product in con.'lumer use or any vessel.\n   (b) The executive director may conduct investigations of facilities which are listed\n on the state registry, or which it has reason to believe should be included on the state\nregistry, in accordance with Section 7 of this Act. If there is a reasonable basis to\n believe there may be a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a\nfacility, the executive director may submit requests for information and requests for\n the production of documents to any person who has or may have information' or\ndocuments relevant to:\n      (1) the identification, nature, or quantity of materials that have been generated,\n   treated, stored, or disposed of at a facility or transported to a facility;\n      (2) the identification of soils, ground water, or surface water at a facility that\n   have been or may be affected by an actual or threatened release of a hazardous\n   substance;\n      (3) the nature or extent of a release or threatened release of a hazardous\n   substance at or from a facility; or\n      (4) the ability of a person to pay for or to perform a remedial action.\n   If the requested information or documents are not produced in a timely manner,\n the commission may issue an order directing compliance with the requests for\ninformation or production of documents. Information or documents requested\nunder this subsection shall be public records, except that, if a showing satisfactory to\n the commission is made by the owner of the records that the records would divulge\n trade secrets if made public, then the commission shall consider the copied records as\nconfidential. Nothing in this subsection .'/hall require the commission to consider the\ncomposition or characteristics of hazardous substances being processed, stored, dis·\nposed of, or otherwise handled to be held confidential. The commission shall promul-\ngate rules regarding the provision of notice and an opportunity for a hearing before\n the commission on whether the requested injormaf.ion or documents should be\nproduced.\n   (c) Prior to the listing of a facility on the state registry, the executive director shall\nfirst determine whether the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the\nenvironment at the facility can be resolved by the present owner or operator under\n the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 8901) or by\nsome or all of the potentially responsible parties identified in Section B(g), pursuant\n to an agreed administrati?Je order issued by the commission. If the potential endan-\ngerment to public health and safety or the environment can be resolved in such a\nmanner, the facility shall not be listed on the state registry. Notice of the approach\nselected to resolve the apparent endangerment to health and public safety or the\nenvironment and the fact that this action is being taken in lieu of listing the facility\non the state registry shall be published in the Texas Register. If after reasonable\nefforts the executive director determines that the potential endangerment to public\nhealth and safety or the environment cannot be resolved by either of these approaches,\n the executive director shall evaluate the facility to determine whether the site exceeds\n the commission~ minimum criteria for listing on the state regisi ry. These minimum\ncriteria shall be promulgated by rule. The executive director sltall also evaluate the\nfacility to determine whether it is eligible for listing on the federal National Priorities\nList. The commission shall proceed under this section only if, based on information\navailable to the executive director, the facility is eligible for listing on the state\nregistry but not eligible for the federal National Priorities List.\n                                           3219\n\fCh. 703, § 5                              7lst LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     (1) Once the executive director has determined that the facility is eligible for\n listing on the state registriJ, the commission shall publish in the Texas Register and\n in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located a\n notice of intent to list the facility on the state registry. The notice shall at least\n specify the name and location of tlte facility, the general nature of the potential\n endangerment to public health and safety or the environment as determined by\n information available to the executive director at that time, and the duties and\n restrictions imposed by Subsection (c)(3) . of this section. The notice also shall\n provide that interested parties may do either or both of the following: (A) submit\n written comments to the commission relative to the proposed listing of the facility,·\n or (B) request a public meeting to discuss the proposed listing by submitting a\n  request within 30 days of issi;ance of the notice.\n    (2) Once the facility is determined tCJ be eligible for listing on the state registry,\n  the executive director shall make all reasonable efforts to identify all potentially\n responsible parties/or remediation of the facility. Concurrent with the publication\n of general notice in accordance with Subdivision (1) of this subsection, the executive\n director shall provide to e3.ch identified potentially responsible party direct, written\n notification of the proposed listing of the facility on the state registry and of the\n procedures for requesting a public meeting to discuss the listit.:i and the inform.a·\n  tion included in the general notice as required by Subdivision (1) of thi'l subsection.\n  Written notifications under this subsection shall be by certified mail, return receipt\n requested, by mailing notice to each named responsible party at the party 8 last\n known address.\n    (3) If a public meeting is requested regarding the proposed listing of a facility on\n  the state registry, the commission shall publish general notice of the date, time, and\n location of the public meeting in the Texas Register and in the same newspaper in\n which the notice of the opportunity to request the public meetin,Q was published.\n  The public meeting notice shall be provided at least 30 days in advance of the\n meeting. Notice of the meeting also shall be provided by certified mail, return\n receipt requested, to all identified potentially responsible parties at the parties' last\n known addresses. Nonreceipt of any notice mailed to a potentially responsible\n party pursuant to this subdivision or Subdivision (2) of this subsection shall in no\n way affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities imposed on the party. Contem·\n poraneously with the issuance of notice of the public meeting, the executive director\n shall make available to all interested parties the public records he has regarding the\n facility. For the purposes of providing this information, the executive director\n shall provide a brief summary of the public records he has and make these public\n records available for inspection and copying during regular business hours.\n    (4) The public meetings will be legislative in nature and not contested case\n hearings under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article\n 6252-13a, Vernons Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held/or the purpose\n of obtaining additional information regarding the facility relative to the eligibility\n of the facility for listing on the state registry and the identification of potentially\n respon:Jible partfos.\n    (5) Subsequent to the public meeting or after opportunity to request a public\n meeting has passed, the commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or\n notice in the real property records of the county in which a facility is located\n identifying the facility as one proposed for listing on the state registry, unless the\n executive director determines, based on information presented at the public meet·\n ing, that efforts to list the facility on the state registry should not be pursued.\n    (6)(A) Subsequent to the public meeting or after opportunity to request a pubtic\n meeting has passed, but prior to any listing of the facility on the state registry, the\n commission shall allow all identified potentially responsible parties the opportuni·\n ty to fund or conduct, if appropriate, a remedial investigation/feasibility study, or\n similar study as approved by the executive director, for the facility. The potentially\n responsible parties shall have 90 days from the date of the issuance of notice of the\n opportunity to request a public meeting to make a good faith offer to conduct the\n                                         3220\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                         Ch. 703, § 5\n study. If a good faith offer from all or some of the potentially responsible parties is\n received by the commission within 90 days, those making the offer sl:all have an\n additional 60 days within which to negotiate an agreed administrative order from\n  the commission, which shall include a scope of work. The commission shall not\n require the participating potentially responsible parties to agree to perform the\n remedial action or admit liability for the facility remediation in this agreed\n administrative order.\n       (B) If no potentially responsible party makes a good faith offer to conduct the\n    remedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study as approved by the\n    executive director or .if the participating potentially responsible parties fail to\n    conduct or complete an· approved study, the commission is authorized to conduct\n    or complete the study using funds from the hc;,zardous waste disposal fee fund.\n       (C) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial inves-\n    tigation/feasibility Etudy or other similar study as approved by the executive\n    director, no costs for commission oversight of the study may be assessed against\n    those parties who fund or perform the study. Nonparticipating pote.ttially\n    responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of\n    the facility under this Act or who subsequentll' enter into an agreed ordu relative\n    to the remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs fot\n    commission oversight of the study process. If all potentially responsible parties\n    participate or agree to fund the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other\n    similar study, all commission oversight costs shall be borne by the hazardous\n    waste disposal fee fund.\n       (D) Once the executive director has determin 1u;! that a facility is eligible for\n    listing on the state registry, no person shall perform at the facility any partial or\n    total removal activities except as authorized by the executive director in appropri-\n    ate circumstances after notice and opportunity for comment to all other poten-\n    tially responsible parties. The commission may develop rules determining what\n    constitutes an appropriate circumstance to take removal action under this\n    paragraph. Authorization by the executive director to conduct a partial or total\n    removal action shall not constitute a final determination of the party$ ultimate\n    liability for remediation of the facility, nor a determination of divisibility.\n    (7)(A) Once the facility is determined to be eligibl1?for listing on the state registry,\n the owner or operator of the facility must provide the executive director with\n written notice of any substantial change in use of the facility at least 60 days before\n the change in use is made. Notice of a prnposed substantial change in use shall be\n in writing, addressed to the executive director, provided by certified mail, return\n receipt requested, and shall include a brief description of the proposed change in\n use. A substantia! change in use shall be defined by rule and shall include but not\n be limited to actions such as the erection of a building or other structure at the\n facility, the use of the facility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility\n for use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or\n private recreational use on the facility.\n       (B) If, within 30 days of the notice, the executive director determines that the\n    proposed substantial change in use will interfere significantly with a proposed or\n    ongoing remedial investigation/feasibility study, or similar study approved by\n    the executive director, or expose the public health and safety or the environment\n    to a significantly increased threat of harm, then he shall notify the owner or\n    operator of his determination. Once the determination is made and notification\n    given, the owner or operator shall not proceed with the proposed substantial\n    change in use. The owner or operator may request a hearing before the commis-\n    sion on whether the determination should be modified or set aside by submitting\n    a request within 30 days of receipt of the executive director$ determination. If a\n    hearing is requested, the commission shall initiate the hearing within 45 days of\n    the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the\n    Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon$\n                                          3221\n\fCh. 703, § 5                              71et LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n     Texas Civil Statutes). The executive director's determination shall become unap-\n     pealable 30 days after issuance if a hearing is not requested.\n    (8) Within a reasonable time following the completion of the remedial investiga·\n  tionlfeasibility study or other similar study, if required, the executive director shall\n select a proposed remedial action. Subsequent to its selection of a proposed\n remedial action, the commission shall hold a public meeting to discuss the proposed\n action. The commission shall publish notice of the meeting in the Texas Register\n and in a newspaper ofgeneral circulation in the county where the facility is located\n at least 45 days prior to the public meeting. The notice shall provide information\n regarding the proposed remedial action and the date, time, and place of the\n meeting. The commission shall also mail the same information to each potentially\n responsible party by certified mail, return receipt requested, at each party's last\n known address at least 45 days prior to the publii: meeting Contemporaneously\n with the issuance of notice of the public meeti1~g, the executive director shall make\n available to all interested parties the public records he has regarding the facility.\n For purposes of providing this information, the executive director shall provide a\n brief summary of the public records he has and make these public records available\n for inspection and copying during regular business hours. Nonreceipt of any notice\n mailed to a potentially responsible party pursuant to this subdivision shall in no\n 1;ay affect the responsibilities, duties, 01· liabilities imposed on any such party.\n    (9) The public meeting shall bt legislative in nature and not conducted as a\n contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act\n (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held for the\n purpose :if obtaining additional information regarding the facility and the identifi·\n cation of additional potentially responsible parties. Those in attendance may\n present their comments on the proposed remedial action, and the executive director\n may revise its proposed remedial action in light of the presentations.\n    (JO)(A) Subsequent to the public meeting on the proposed remedial action, the\n commission shall provide all identified potentially responsible parties an opportu-\n nity to fund or perform the proposed remedial action. The potentially responsible\n parties shall have 60 days from the date of the public meeting in which to make a\n good faith offer to perform or fund the proposed remedial action. If a good faith\n offer is made by all or some of the potentially responsible parties within the 6{1-day\n period, then these parties will have an additional 60 days to negotiate an aoreed\n administrative order from the commission, which shall include a scope of u ork.\n The commission shall not require an admission of liability in the agreed adr.1 inis·\n trative order.\n       (B) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial ac·\n    tion, no costs for commission oversight of the remedial action may be assessed\n    against those parties who fund or perform the remedial action. Nonpartic·\n    ipating potentially responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable\n    for remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs/or commission\n    oversight of the remedial action. If all potentially responsible parties conduct or\n    fund the remedial action, all commission oversight costs shall be borne by the\n    hazardous waste disposal fee fund. Participation in the remedial action does not\n    relieve those who did not conduct or fund the remedial investigation/feasibility\n    study or other similar study approved by the executive director from paying their\n    portion of the oversight costs of that phase of the remediation.\n       (C) The executive director may authorize a potentially responsible party to\n    conduct a partial remedial action at a portion of the facility if the executive\n    director determines that the release or threatened release is divisible after notice\n    and opportunity for comment to all other potentially responsible parties. For\n    purposes of this section, \"divisible\" means that the hazardous substance released\n    or threatened to be released is capable of being managed separately under the\n    remedial action plan. A determination of divisibility by the executive director\n    shall have no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on a potentially responsible\n    party's ultimate liability for remediation of the facility under Section 8.\n                                         3222\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                           Ch. 703, § 5\n      (11) After consideration of all good faith offers to perform a remedial action, the\n   commission shall issue a final administrative order that shall:\n        (A) list the facility on the state registry, thus determining that the facility poses\n      an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the\n      environment;\n        (B) specify the selected remedial action,·\n         (C) list the parties determined to be responsible for remediating the facility,·\n         (D) make findings offact describing actions voluntarily undertaken by respon-\n      sible parties,·\n        (E) order the responsible parties to remediate the facility and, if appropriate,\n      reimburse the hazardous waste disposal fee fund for remedial investigation/fea-\n      sibility study and remediation costs;\n        (F) establish a schedule for completion of the remedial action,·\n        (G) state any determination of divisibility of responsible party liability; and\n        (H) give notice of the duties and restrictions imposed by Subsection (/) of this\n      section.      ·\n   The provisions in Sections B(g), 9, 10, and 11 of this Act relating to administrative\norders shall apply to orders issued pursuant to this paragraph.\n      (12) If a potentially responsible party is newly identified after a final administra-\n   tive order has been issued by the commission pursuant to Subdivision (11) of this\n   sub~ection, that party shall have 60 days to negotiate an amendment to the existing\n   order. The commission shall not be prohibited from issuing a separate order for\n   the newly identified potentially responsible party if it determines that the circum-\n   stances warrant a separate order. The responsible parties identified in the order\n   issued pursuant to Subdivision (11) of this subsection shall be allowed to comment\n   on the issuance of a separate order for the newly identified potentially responsible\n   party.\n   (d) The commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or notice in the real\nproperty records of the county in which the facility is located stating that the facility\nhas been listed on or deleted from the state registry or is no longer proposed for\nlisting on the state registry, within a reasonable period after a determination has\nbeen made.\n   (e) Any owner or operator or other named responsible party of a facility listed or to\nbe listed in the state registry may request the commission to delete the facility from\n the state registry, modify the facility~ priority within the state registry, or modify\nany information regarding the facility by submitting a written statement setting\nforth the grounds of the request in the form as the commission may require pursuant\n to its promulgated rules. The commission shall promulgate rules establishing proce-\ndures, including public hearings, for review of requests submitted pursuant to this\nsubsection.\n   (/) Subsequent to the listing of a facility on the state registry, no person may\nsubstantially change the manner in which the facility is used without notifying the\nexecutive director and receiving written approval of the executive director for the\nchange. A substantial change in use shall be rll!fined by rule and shall include but\nnot be limited to actions such as the erection of u building or other structure at the\nfacility, the use of the facility for agriculturq,l production, the paving of the facility\nfor use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or\nprivate recreational use on the facility. The notice shall be in writing, addressed to\n the executive director, provided by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall\ninclude a brief description of the proposed change of use. The executive director shall\napprove or disapprove the proposed action within 60 days of receipt of the notice of\nproposed change in use. The executive director shall not approve the proposed change\nof use if such new use will significantly interfere with a proposed, ongoing, or\ncompleted remedial action program at a facility or expose the public health and\nsafety or the environment to a significantly increased threat of harm.\n                                           3223\n\fCh. 703, § 5                                71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n   (g)(J) Whenever the commission, after investigation, finds that there exists a release\nor threatened release of a hazardous substance at n facility that: (A) is causing\nirreversible or irreparable harm to the public health and safety or the environment,·\nand (B) the immediacy of the situation makes it prejudic.ial to the public interest to\ndelay action until an administrative order can be issue1t to potentially responsible\nparties or until a judgment can be entered in an appeal of an administrative order,·\n the commission may, with the funds available to the corn.mission from the hazardous\nwaste disposal fee fund, undertake immediate removal action at the facility to\nalleviate the harm. After the immediate danger of irreversible or irreparable harm\nhas been alleviated, the commission shall proceed pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection. Fi.ndings required pursuant to this subsection shall be in writing and may\nbe made by the commission on an ex parte basis subject to judicial review pursuant to\n the substantial evidence rule as provided by the Administrative Procedure and Texas\nRegister Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon~ Texas Civil Statutes).\n      (2) The reasonable expenses of any immediate removal action taken by the\n   commission may be recoverable from the persons described in Section 8, and the\n   state may seek to recover the reasonable expenses in any court of appropriate\n   jurisdiction.\n   (h) Whenever a person ordered to eliminate an imminent and substantial endan·\ngerment to the public health and safety or the environment has failed to do so within\n the time limits specified in the order or any extension of time approved by the\ncommission, the commission may implement the remedial action program for the\nfacility. The reasonable expenses of implementing the remedial action program by\n the commission shall be paid by the persons to whom the order was issued and shall be\nrecoverable under the provisions of Subsection (m) of this section.\n   (i)(J) The goal of any remedial action shall be the elimination of the imminent and\nsubstantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment posed\n by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility. The\nappropriate extent of the remedial action at any particular facility shall be deter-\n mined by the commission~ selection of the remedial alternative which the state\nagency determines is cost effective (i.e., the lowest cost alternative that is technologi-\ncally feasible and reliable and which effectively mitigates and minimizes damage to\nand provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the environment).\n      (2) In considering the appropriate remedial action program at a particular\n   facility, the commission may approve a program that does not attain a level or\n   standard of control at least equivalent to a legally applicable or relevant and\n   appropriate standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, as required by state or\n   local law, if the commission finds that:\n         (A) the remedial action selected is only part of a total remedial action that will\n      attain such level or standard of control when completed,·\n         (B) compliance with the requirement at that facility will result in greater risk\n      to public health and safety or the environment than alternative options,·\n         (C) compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an\n      engineering perspective,·\n         (D) the remedial action selected will attain a standard of performance that is\n      equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement,\n      criterion, or limitation through use of another method or approach,·\n         (E) with respect to a local standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, the\n      locality has not consistently applied (or demonstrated the intention to consistent-\n      ly apply) the standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation in similar circum-\n      stances of other remedial actions within the locality,· or\n         (F) with respect to an action using solely state funds, selection of a remedial\n      action that attains such levels or standards of control will not provide a balance\n      between the need/or protection of public health and safety or the environment at\n      the facility and the availabilty of state funds to respond to other sites that present\n                                           3224\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                        Ch. 703, § 5\n      a threat to public health and safety or the environment, taking into consideration\n      the relative immediacy of the threats.\n  (jJ In adflition to all other remedies available to the state under this Act or any\nother law or statute, all remediation costs for which a person is liable to the state\nshall constitute a lien in favor of the state on the real property and the rights to the\nreal property that are subject to or affected by a remedial action.

The bond shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the\n  real property subject to the lien is located. An action to establish, enforce, or\n  foreclose any lien or claim of lien covered by the bond must be brought not later\n   than the 90th day after the date of service of notice of the bond.\n      (BJ The bond must:\n         (AJ describe the real property upon which the lien is claimed,·\n         (BJ refer to the lien claimed in a manner sufficient to identify it,·\n          (CJ be in an amount double the amount of the lien referred to,·\n          (DJ be payable to the commission;\n         (EJ be executed by the party filing the bond as principal and a corporate surety\n      authorized under the law of this state to execute the bond as surety,· and\n          (FJ be conditioned substantially that the principal and sureties will pay to the\n      commission the amount of the lien claimed, plus costs, if the claim is proved to be\n      a lien on the real property.\n      (9J .After the bond is filed, the county clerk shall issue notice of the bond to the\n  named obligee. A copy of the bond must be attached to the notice. The notice may\n  be served on each obligee by having a copy delivered to the obligee by any person\n  competent to make oath of the delivery. The original notice shall be returned to the\n                                          3225\n\fCh. 703, § 5                               71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION\n\n    office of the county clerk, and the person making service of copy shall make an oath\n    on the back of the copies showing on whom and on what date the copies were served.\n    The county clerk shall record the bond notice and return in records kept for that\n    purpose. In acquiring an interest in real property, a purchaser or lender may rely\n    on and is absolutely protected by the record of the bond, notice, and return.\n       (10) The commission may sue on the bond after the 30th day following the date on\n    which the notice is served but may not sue on the bond later than one year after the\n    date on which the notice is served. If the commission recovers in a suit on the lien\n    or on the bond, it is entitled to also recover reasonable attorney's fees.\n   (k) Money for actions taken or to be taken by the commission in connection with the\n elimination of an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and\n safety or the environment pursuant to this section shall be payable directly to the\n commission from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund. This includes any costs of\n inspection or sampling and laboratory analysis of wastes, soils, air, surface water,\n and ground water done on behalf of a state agency and the costs of investigations to\n identify and locate potentially responsible parties.\n    (l) The commission shall seek remediation of facilities by potentially responsible\n parties prior to expenditure offederal or state funds for the remediations. Potential·\n ly responsible parties shall coordinate with ongoing federal and state hazardous waste\n programs, although no state or local permit shall be required for any removal or\n remedial action conducted on site. Subject to the provisions nf Subsection (i) of this\n section, the state may enforce any federal or state standard, requirement, criterion,\n or limitation to which the remedial action would otherwise be required to conform if a\n permit were required. No action taken by the person to contain or remove a release\n or threatened release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan shall be\n construed as an admission of liability for said release or threatened release. No\n person who renders assistance in containing or removing a release or threatened\n release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan shall be liable for any\n additional remediation costs at the facility resulting solely from acts or omissions of\n the person in rendering the assistance in compliance with the approvals required by\n this subsection, unless the remediation costs were caused by the person's gross\n negligence or wilful misconduct. Except as specifically provided in this subsection,\n these provisions shall not be construed to expand or diminish the common law tort\n liability, if any, of private parties participa~ing in a remediation action for civil\n damages to third parties.\n    (m) The commission sh1ill file a cost recovery action against all respomnble parties\n who have not complied with the terms of an administrative order issued pursuant to\n Subdivision (11} or (12) of Subsection (c) of this section. The commission shall file\n the cost recovery action no later than one year after all remedial action has been\n completed. The state may seek a judgment against the noncompliant parties for the\n total amount of the cost of the remedial action, including costs of any necessary\n studies and oversight costs, minus the amount agreed to be paid or expended by any\n other responsible parties pursuant to an order issued pursuant to Subdivision (11) or\n (12) of Subsection (c) of this section. The action may also include a plea seeking civil\n penalties for noncompliance with the commission's administrative order and a claim\n for up to double the state's costs if the responsible party's defenses are determined by\n the court to be unreasonable, frivolous, or without foundation.\n· (n)(l) A responsible party named in an administrative order who does not comply\n with the order shall become subject to the imposition of administrative or civil\n penalties under Section Bb of this Act. The penalties may be assessed only from the\n date after which the administrative order becomes nonappealable.\n       (2) The commission is authorized to include provisions within an agreed adminis·\n    trative order that stipulate administrative penalty amounts for failure to comply\n    with the order. The penalty provisions may be applicable to either or both of the\n    remedial investigation/feasibility study and remedial action orders.\n    (o)(l) The commiss-ion shall promulgate rules necessary to develop a mixed funding\n program in which available money from potentially responsible parties is combined\n                                          8226\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-REGULAR SESSION                                            Ch. 703, § 5\nwith state or federal funds to clean up a facility in a timely manner. Use of the state\nor federal funds in a mixed funding approach shall not preclude the state or federal\ngovernment from seeking recovery of its costs from nonparticipating potentially\nresponsible parties.\n      (2) The commission shall assess and may, through rulemaking, develop and\n  implement a de minimis settlement program. Under the program, the commission\n  shall be required to consider the advantages of developing a final settlement with\n   potentially responsible parties that are responsible for only a minor portion of the\n  response costs at a facility because the hazardous substances the party is respon•\n  sible for are minimal in amount or in hazardous effect by comparison with the\n  hazardous substances attributable to other parties.\n      (3) The commission shall investigate additional alternative programs to encour·\n  age potentially responsible parties to investigate or remediate facilities and report\n   its findings to the 72nd Legislature with recommendations for legislative action.\n  (p) The commission is authorized to determine whether a potentially responsible\nparty is. financially capable of conducting any necessary remediation studies or\nremedial action. The commission shall promulgate rules to develop the criteria for\ndetermination of financial capability. If no financially capable potentially r~pon·\nsible parties exist for a facility, the commission shall issue an administrative order\nstating its determination that the facility constitutes an imminent and substantial\nendangerment and that there are no financially capable potentially responsible\nparties. The commission shall then conduct its own remediation study and remedial\naction, using federal funds if available. Iffederal funds are not available, state funds\nfrom the hazardous waste disposal fee fund shall be used. Generally, the remediation\nof listed facilities shall be achieved first by private party funding, second with the aid\nof federal funds, and third, if necessary, with state funds from the hazardous waste\ndisposal fee fund.\n  (q) The executive director or the commission shall have the authority to extend any\ntime period specified in this section if deemed appropriate.\n   [Seo. 13, IDENTIFICATION AND J..SSESSMENT OF HAZJ..RDO:US WASTE FA\nCIUTIES, (a) The department ef water reseurees, in eeeperatien with the department,\nshall oenduot and oemplete a survey ef the state by July 1, 11~8G 1 the pUFf19Se ef whioh is\nt9 identify te the extent feasible every hazardeus waste faoility whieh may oenstitute an\nimminent and substantial endangerment te publio health and safety er the envirenment,\nThe werk already perfermed te identify eandidate sites fur inolusien in the federal\nNatienal Pri9rities list shall serve as the basis fer suoh a sun•ey, As seen as pessible\nafter e9mpletien ef a draft survey, the department ef water reseurees shall eenduot a\npublio hearing te selieit oemments en the draft survey and inf9rmatien en additienal\neandidate sites.

This subsection does not require the commission to consider\nthe composition or characteristics of hazardous substances being processed, stored,\ndisposed of, or otherwise handled to be held confidential.\n    (d) The commission shall adopt rules regarding the provision of notice and an\nopportunity for a hearing before the commission on whether the requested informa-\ntion or documents should be produced.\n    Sec. 361.183. REGISTRY LISTING PROCEDURE: DETERMINATION OF ELIGI-\nBILITY. (a) Before the listing of a facility on the state registry, the executive dfrector\nshall determine whether the potential endangerment to public hFalth and safety or\n the environment at the facility can be resolved by the present owner or operator\nunder the federal Resource Conservation and Recoi·ery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. Section\n6901) or by some or all of the potentially responsible parties identified in Subchapter\nI, under an agreed administrative order issued by the commission.\n    (b) If the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the environment\ncan be resolved in such a manner, the facility may not be listed on the state registry.\nNotice of the approach selected to resolve the apparent endangerment to public health\nand safety or the emrironment and the fact that this action is being taken in lieu of\n listing the facility on the state registry shall be published in the Texas Register.\n    (c) If after reasonable efforts the executive director determines that the potential\nendangerment to public health and safety or the environment cannot be resolved by\neither of the approaches under Subsection (a), the executive director shall evaluate the\nfacility to determine whether the site exceeds the commission 8 minimum criteria for\n listing on the state registry. The commission by rule shall adopt the minimum\n criteria. The extcutive director shall also evaluate the facility to determine whether it\n is eligible for listing on the federal National Priorities List.\n    (d) The commission shall proceed under th!,s subchapter only if, based on informa-\n tion available to the executive di ..ector, the facility is eligible for listing on the state\n registry but not eligible for the federal National Priorities List.\n    Sec. 361.184. REGISTRY LISTING PROCEDURE: NOTICES AND HEARING. (a)\n If the executive director determines that a facility is eligible for listing on the state\n registry, the commission shall publish in the Texas Register and in a newspaper of\ngeneral circulation in the county in which the facility is located a notice of intent to\n list the facility on the state registry. The 11otice shall at least specify tne name and\n location of the facility, the general natun of the potential endangerment to public\n health and safety or the environment as determined by information available to the\n executive director at that time, and the duties and restrictions imposed by Subsection\n(c). The notice aiE'I shall provide that interested parties may do either or both of the\nfollowing:\n       (1) submit written comments to the commission relative to the Froposed listing of\n    the facility,· or\n                                             67\n\fCh. 10, Art. 2, § 29                71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION\n\n      (2) request a public meeting to discuss the proposed listing by submitting a\n   request not later than the 30th day after the date on which the notice is issued.\n  (b) If the facility is determined to be eligible for listing on the state registry, the\nexecutive director shall make all reasonable efforts to identify all potentially respon-\nsible parties for remediation of the facility. Concurrent with the publication of\ngeneral notice under Subsection (a), the executive director shall provide to each\nidentified potentially responsible party direct, written notification of the proposed\nlisting of the facility on the state registry and of the procedures for requesting a\npublic meeting to discuss the listing and the information included in the general\nnotice as required by Subsection (a). Written notifications under this subsection\nshall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each named responsible party at\nthe party's last known address.\n   (c) If a public meeting is requested regarding the proposed listing of a facility on\nthe state registry, the commission shall publish general notice of the date, time, and\nlocation of the public meeting in the Texas Register arirl in the same newspaper in\nwhich the notice of the opportunity to request the public meeting was published. The\npublic meeting notice shall be provided not later than the 31st day before the date of\nthe meeting. Notice of the meeting also shall be provided by certified mail, return\nreceipt requested, to each ident~tied potentially responsible party at the party's last\nknown address.\n   (d) Nonreceipt of any notice mailed to a potentially responsible party under\nSubsection (b) or this subsection does not affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabili-\nties imposed on the party. Contemporaneously with issuing the notice of the public\nmeeting, the executive director shall make available to all interested parties the public\nrecords the executive director has regarding the facility. For the purposes of provid-\ning this information, the executive director shall provide a brief summary of those\npublic records and make those public records available for inspection and copying\nduring regular business hours.\n   (e) A public meeting is legislative in nature and not a contested case hearing under\nthe Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Vernon's\nTexas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held for the purpose of obtaining\nadditional information regarding the facility relative to the eligibility of the facility\nfor listing on the state registry and the identification of potentially responsible\nparties.\n   (/) After the public --neeting or after opportunity to request a public meeting has\npassed, the commissivr. shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or notice in the real\nproperty records of the county in which the facility is located identifying the facility\nas one proposed for listing on the state registry unless the executive director deter-\nmines, based on information presented at the public meeting, that efforts to list the\nfacility on the state registry should not be pursued.\n   Sec. 361.185. INVESTIGATION/FEASIBILITY STUDY. (a) After the public meet-\ning or after opportunity to request a public meeting has passed, but before any listing\nof the facility on the state registry, the commission shall allow all identified potential-\nly responsible parties the opportunity to fund or conduct, if appropriate, a remedial\ninvestigation/feasibility study, or a similar study as approved by the executive\ndirector, for the facility. Not later than the 90th day after notice under Section\n361.184(a) is issued, the potentially responsible parties may make a good faith offer to\nconduct the study. If a good faith offer from all or some of the potentially responsible\nparties is received by the commission within that period, those making the offer have\nan additional 60 days within which to negotiate an agreed administrative order from\nthe commission, which must include a scope of work. In the agreed administrative\norder the commission may not require the participating potentially r11sponsible\nparties to agree to perform the remedial action or admit liability for the facility\nremediation.\n   (b) If no pot mtinlly responsible party makes a good faith offer to conduct the\nremedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study as approved by the executive\ndirector or if the participating potentially responsible parties fail to conduct or\n                                            68\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION                         Ch. 10, Art. 2, § 29\ncomplete an approved study, the commission may conduct or complete the study\nusing funds from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.\n   (c) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial investiga-\ntionlfec;,sibility study or other similar study as approved by the executive director,\ncosts for commission oversight of the study may not be assessed against those parties\nwho fund or perform the study. Nonparticipating potentially re.<lponsible parties who\nare ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of the facility under this\nchapter or who subsequently enter into an agreed order relative to the remediation of\ntha facility may be assessed up to the full costs for commission oversight of the study\nprocess. If all potentially responsible parties participate or agree to fund the\n1emedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar study, all commission over-\nsight costs shall be paid from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.\n   Sec. 361.186. FACILITY ELIGIBLE FOR LISTING: ACTIVITIES AND CHANGE\nOF USE. (a) If the executive director determines that a facility is eligible for listing\non the state registry, a person may not perform at the facility any partial or total\nremoval activities except as authorized by the executive director in appropriate\ncircumstances after notice and opportunity for comment to all other potentially\nresponsible parties. The commission may adopt rules determining what constitutes\nan appropriate circumstance to take removal action under this subsection. Authori-\nzation by the executive director to conduct a partial or total removal action does not\nconstitute:\n      (1) a fi:nal determination of the party's ultimate liability for remedfotion of the\n   facility,· or\n      (2) a determination of divisibility.\n   (b) If the facility is determined to be eligible for listing on the state registry, the\nowner or operator of the facility must provide the executive director with written\nnotice of any substantial change in use of the facility before the 60th day before the\ndate on which the change in use is made. Notice of a proposed substantial change in\nuse must be in writing, addressed to the executive director, sent by certified mail,\nreturn receipt requested, and include a brief description of the proposed change in\nuse. A substantial change in use shall be defined by rule and must include actions\nsuch as the erection of a building or other structure at the facility, the use of the\nfacility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility for use as a roadway or\nparking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or private recreational use on\nthe facility.\n   (c) If, within 30 days after the date of the notice, the executive director determines\nthat the proposed substantial change in use will interfere significantly with a\nproposed or ongoing remedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study ap-\nproved by the executive director or expose the public health and safety or the\nenvironment to a significantly increased threat of harm, the executive director shall\nnotify the owner or operator of the determination. After the determination is made\nand notification given, the owner or operator may not proceed with the proposed\nsubstantial change in use. The owner or operator may request a hearing before the\ncommission on whether the determination should be modified or set aside by submit-\n ting a request not later than the 30th day after the receipt of the executive director's\ndetermination. If a hearing is requested, the commission shall initiate the hearing\nnot later than the 45th day after the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be\nconducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act\n(Article 6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes). The executive director's determina-\n tion becomes unappealable on the 31st day after issuance if a hearing is not\n requested.\n   Sec. 361.187. PROPOSED REMEDIAL ACTION. (a) Within a reasonable time\nafter the completion of the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar\nstudy, if required, the executive director shall select a proposed remedial action.\nAfter the selection of a proposed remedial action, the commission shall hold a public\nmeeting to discuss the proposed action.\n                                           69\n\fCh. 10, Art. 2, § 29                 71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION\n\n   (b) The commission shall publish notice of the meeting in the Texas Register and in\na newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located at\nleast 45 days before the date of the public meeting. The notice shall provide informa-\n tion regarding the proposed remedial action and the date, time, etr.d place of the\n meeting. The commission shall also mail the same information to each potentially\n responsible party by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's last known\n address at least 45 days before the public meeting. Contemporaneously with the\nissuance of notice of thr public meeting, the executive director shall make available to\nall interested parties the public records the executive director has regarding the\nfacility. For purposes of providing this information, the executive director shall\nproiide a brief summary of those public records and make those public records\navailable for inspection and copying during regular business hours. Nonreceipt of\nany notice mailed to a potentially responsible party under this section does not affect\n the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities imposed on the party.\n   (c) The public meeting is legislative in nature and not a contested case hearing\nunder the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article 6252-13a, Ver-\nnon s Texas Civil Statutes). The meeting shall be held for the purpose of obtaining\nadditional information regarding the facility and the identification of additional\npotentially responsible parties. Those in attendance may comment on the proposed\n remedial action, and the executive director may revise the proposed remedial action\nin light of the presentations.\n   (d) After the public meeting on the proposed remedial action, the commission shall\nprovide all identified potentially responsible parties an opportunity to fund or\nperform the proposed remedial action. Not later than the 60th day after the date of\nthe public meeting, the potentially responsible parties may make a good faith offer to\nfund or perform the proposed remedial action. If a good faith offer is made by all or\nsome of the potentially responsible parties within this period, those parties have an\nadditional 60 days to negotiate an agreed administrative order from the commission,\nwhich shall include a scope of work. The commission may not require an admission\nof liability in the agreed administrative order.\n   (e) To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial action,\ncosts for commission oversight of the remedial action may not be assessed against\nthose parties who fund or perform the remedial action. Nonparticipating potentially\nresponsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of the\nfacility may be assessed up to the full costs for commission oversight of the remedial\naction. If all potentially responsible parties conduct or fund the remedial action, all\ncommission oversight costs shall be paid from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.\nParticipation in the remedial action does not relieve those who did not conduct or\nfund the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar study approved by\nthe executive director from paying their portion of the oversight costs of that phase of\nthe remediation.\n   (/) The executive director may authorize a potentially responsible party to conduct\na partial remedial action at a portion of the facility if after notice and opportunity\nfor comment to all other potentially responsible parties the executive director deter-\nmines that the release or threatened release is divisible. In this subchapter, \"divisi-\nble\" means that the hazardous substance relea..cied or threatened to be released is\ncapable of being managed separately under the remedial action plan. A determina-\ntion of divisibility by the executive director does not have res judicata or collateral\nestoppel effect on a potentially responsible party's ultimate liability for remediation\nof the facility under Subchapter G or I.\n   Sec. 361.188. FINAL ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER. (a) After consideration of all\ngood faith offers to perform a remedial action, the commission shall issue a final\nadministrative order that must:\n      (1) list the facility on the state registry, thus determining that the facility poses\n   an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and safety or the\n   environment,·\n      (2) specify the selected remedial action;\n                                               70\n\f71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION                           Ch. 10, Art. 2, § 29\n    (3) list the parties determined to be responsible for remediating the facility,·\n    (4) make findings of fact describing actions voluntarily undertaken by respon-\n   sible parties,·\n      (5) order the responsible parties to remediate the facility and, if appropriate,\n   reimburse the hazardous waste disposal fee fund for remedial investigation/fea-\n   sibility study and remediation costs;\n      (6) establish a schedule for completion of the remedial action,·\n      (7) state any determination of divisibility of responsible party liability,· and\n      (8) give notice of the duties and restrictions imposed by Section 361.190.\n   (b) The provisions in Subchapters I, K, and L relating to administrative orders\napply to orders issued under this section.\n   (c) If a potentially responsible party is newly identified afte1· a final administrative\norder under Subsection (a) has been issued by the commission, that party has 60 days\n to negotiate an amendment to the existing order. The commission is not prohibited\nfrom issuing a separate order for the newly identified potentially responsible party if\n the commission determines that the circumstances warrant a separate order. The\n responsible parties identified in the order issued under Subsection (a) shall be allowed\n to com?r ·1. on the issuance of a separate order for the newly identified potentialiy\n responsitJti; party.\n   (d) Within a reasonable period after a determination has been made, the commis-\nsion shall file or cause to be filed in the real property records of the county in which\n the facility is located an affidavit or notice stating that lite facility has been listed on\nor deleted from the state registry or is no longer proposed for listing on the state\nregistriJ.\n   Sec. 361.189. DELETIONS FROM REGISTRY. (a) Any owner or operator or other\nnamed responsible party of n facility listed or to be listed on the state registry may\nrequest the commission to delete the facility from the state registry, modify the\nfacility's priority within the state registry, or modify any information regarding the\nfacility by submitting a written statement setting forth the grounds of the request in\n the form the commission may by rule require.\n   (b) The commission by rule shall establish procedures, including public hearings,\nfor review of requests submitted under this section.\n   Sec. 361.190. CHANGE IN USE OF LISTED FACILITY. (a) After the listing of a\nfacility on the state registry, a person may not substantially change the manner in\nwhich the facility is used without notifying the executive director and receiving\nwritten approval of the executive director for the change.\n   (b) A substantial change in use shall be defined by rule and shall include actions\nsuch as the erection of a building or other structure at the facility, the use of the\nfacility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility for use as a roadway or\nparking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or private recreational use on\n the facility.\n   (c) The notice must be in writing, addressed to the executive director, sent by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested, and include a brief description of the\nproposed change in use.\n   (d) The executive director shall approve or disapprove the proposed action within 60\ndays after the date of receipt of the notice of proposed change in use. The executive\ndirector may not approve the proposed change in use if the new use will significantly\ninterfere with a proposed, ongoing, or completed remedial action program at a\nfacility or expose the public health and safety or the environment to a significantly\nincreased threat of harm.\n   Sec. 361.191. IMMEDIATE REMOVAL. (a) If the commission, after investigation,\nfinds that there exists a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a\nfacility that is causing irreversible or irreparable harm to the public health and\nsafety or the environment and that the immediacy of the situation makes it preju-\n                                             71\n\fCh.

REMEDIAL ACTION BY COMMISSION. (a) If a person ordered to\neliminate an imminent and substantial endangennent to the public health and safety\nor the environment has/ailed to do so within the time limits specified in the order or\nany extension of time approved by the commission, the commission may implement\nthe remedial action program for the facility.\n   (b) The reasonable expenses of implementing the remedial action program by the\ncommission shall be paid by the persons to whom the order was issued and shall be\nrecoi•erable under Section 361.197.\n   Sec. 361.193. GOAL OF REMEDIAL ACTION. (a) The goal of any remedial action\nis the elimination of the imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health\nand safety or the environment posed by a relecu1e or threatened release of a hazardous\nsubstance at a facility. The appropriate e:>.:tent of the remedial action at any\nparticular facility shall be determined by the commissions selection of the remedial\nalternative that the commission determines is the lowest cost alternative that is\ntechnologically feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and minimizes\ndamage to and provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the\nem>ironment.\n   (b) In considering the appropriate remedial action program at a particular facility,\nthe commission may approve a program that does not attain a level or standard of\ncontrol at least equivalent to a legally applicable or relevant and appropriate\nstandard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, as required by state or local law, if\nthe commission finds that:\n      (1) the remedial action selected is only part of a total remedial action that will\n   attain that level or standard of control when completed,·\n      (2) compliance with the requirement at that facility will result in greater risk to\n   public health and safety or the environment than alternative options,·\n      (3) compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an engi-\n   neering perspective,·\n      (4) the remedial action selected will attain a standard of performa.nce that is\n   equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement,\n   criterion, or limitation through use of another method or approach,·\n      (5) uJi.th respect to a local standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, the\n   locality has not consistently applied or demonstrated the intention to consistently\n   apply the standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation in similar circumstances\n   of other remedial actions within the locality,· or\n      (6) with respect to an action using solely state funds, selection of a remedial\n   action that attain.'l those levels or standards of control will not provide a balance\n   between the need for protection of public health and safety or the environment at\n   the facility and the availability of state funds to respond to other sites that present\n                                           72\n\f7lst LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION                          Ch. 10, Art. 2, § 29\n\n    a threat to public health and safety or the environment, taking into consideration\n    the relative immediacy of the threats.\n   Sec. 361.194. LIEN. (a) In addition to all other remedies available to the state\n under this chapter or other law, all remediation costs for which a person is liable to\n the state constitute a lien in favor of the state on the real property and the rights to\n the real property that are subject to or affected by a remedial action. This provision\n is cumulative of other remedies available to the state under this chapter.\n    (b) The lien imposed by this section arises and attaches to the real property subject\n to or affected by a remedial action at the time an affidavit is recorded and indexed in\naccordance with this section in the county in which the real property is located. For\n the purpose of determining rights of all affected parties, the lien does not relate back\n to a time before the date on which the affidavit is recorded, which date is the lien\n inception date. The lien continues until the liability for tile costs is satisfied or\n becomes unenforceable through operation of law.\n    (c) An authorized representative of the commission shall execute the affidavit. The\naffidavit must show:\n       (1) the names and addresses of the persons liable for the costs;\n       (2) a description of the real property that is subject to or affected by the\n    remediation action for the costs or claims,· and\n       (3) the amount of the costs and the balance due.\n    (d) The county clerk shall record the affidavit in records kept for that purpose and\nshall index the affidavit under the names of the persons liable for the costs.\n    (e) The commission shall record a relinquishment or satisfaction of the lien when\n the lien is paid or satisfied.\n    (j) The lien may be foreclosed only on judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction\nforeclosing the lien and ordering the sale of the property subject to the lien.\n    (g) The lien imposed by this section is not valid or enforreable if real property, an\n interest in real property, or a mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance on or against\n real property is acquired before the affidavit is recorded, unless the person acquiring\n the real property, an interest in the property, or the mortgage, lien, or other\nencumbrance on the property had or reasonably should have had actual notice or\nknowledge that the real property is subject to or affected by a clean-up action or has\nknowledge that the state has incurred clean-up costs.\n   (h) If a lien is fixed or attempted to be fixed as provided by this section, the owner of\n the real property affected by the lien may file a bond to indemnify against the lien.\nThe bond must be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the real property\nsubject to the lien is located. An action to establish, enforce, or foreclose any lien or\nclaim of lien covered by the bond must be brought not later than the 30th day after the\ndate of service of notice of the bond. The bond must:\n       (1) describe the real property on which the lien is claimed,·\n       (2) refer to the lien claimed in a manner sufficient to identify it,·\n       (3) be in an amount double the amount of the lien referred to,·\n       (4) be payable to the cr>mmission,·\n       (5) be executed by the party filing the bond as principal and a corporate surety\n   authorized under the law of this state to execute the bond as surety; and\n       (6) be conditioned substantially that the principal and sureties will pay to the\n   commission the amount of the lien claimed, plus costs, if the claim is proved to be a\n    lien on the real property.\n   (i) After the bond is filed, the county clerk shall issue notice of the bond to the\nnamed obligee. A copy of the bond must be attached to the notice. The notice may be\nserved on each obligee by having a copy delivered to the obligee by any person\ncompetent to make oath of the deli-very. The original notice shall be returned to the\noffice of the county clerk, and the person making service of copy shall make an oath\non the back of the copies showing on whom and on what date the copies were served.\n                                               73\n\fCh. 10, Art. 2, § 29                71st LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION\n\n The county clerk shall record the bond notice and return in records kept for that\npurpose. In acquiring an interest in real property, a purchaser or lender may rely\non and is absolutely protected by the record of the bond, notice, and return.\n   (j) The commission may sue on the bond after the 30th day after the date on which\nthe notice is served but may not sue on the bond later than one year after the date on\nwhich the notice is served. The commission is entitled to recover reasonable attor-\nney's fees if the commission recovers in a suit on the lien or on the bond.\n   Sec. 361.195. PAYMENTS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL FEE FUND.\n(a) Money for actions taken or to be taken by the commission in connection with the\nelimination of an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and\nsafety or the environment under this subchapter is payable directly to the commission\nfrom the hazardous waste disposal fee fund. These payments include any costs of\ninspection or sampling and laboratory analysis of wastes, soils, air, surface water,\nand groundwater done on behalf of a state agency and the costs of investigations to\nidentify and locate potentially respoMible parties.\n   (b) The commission shall seek remediation of facilities by potentially responsible\nparties before expenditure of federal or state funds for the remediations.\n   Sec. 361.196. REMEDIATION: PERMITS NOT REQUIRED; LIABILITY. (a) Po-\ntentially responsible parties shall coordinate with ongoing federal and state hazard-\nous waste programs although a state or local permit may not be required for any\nremoval or remedial action conducted on site.\n   (b) Subject to Section 361.193, the state may enforce any federal or state standard,\nrequirement, criterion, or limitation to which the remedial action would otherwise be\nrequired to conform if a permit were required.\n   (c) An action taken by the person to contain or remove a release or tiireatened\nrelease in accordance with an approved remedial action plan may not be construed as\nan admission of liability for the release or threatened release.\n   (d) A person who renders assistance in containing or removing a release or\nthreatened release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan is not liable\nfor any additional remediation costs at the facility resulting solely from acts or\nomissions of the person in rendering the assistance in compliance with the approvals\nrequired by this section, unless the remediation costs were caused by the persons gross\nnegligence or wilful misconduct.\n   (e) Except as specifically provided by this section, these provisions do not expand or\ndiminish the common law tort liability, if any, of private parties participating in a\nremediation action for civil damages to third parties.\n   Sec. 361.197. COST RECOVERY. (a) The commission shall file a cost recovery\naction against all responsible parties who have not complied with the terms of an\nadministrative order issued under Section 361.188. The commission shall file the cost\nrecovery action no later than one year after all remedial action has been completed.\n   (b) The state may seek a judgment against the noncompliant parties for the total\namount of the cost of the remedial action, including costs of any necessary studies\nand oversight costs, minus the amount agreed to be paid or expended by any other\nresponsible parties under an order issued under Section 361.188.\n   (c) The action may also include a plea seeking civil penalties for noncompliance\nwith the commission's administrative order and a claim for up to double the states\ncosts if the responsible party$ defenses are determined by the court to be unreason-\nable, frivolous, or without foundation.\n   Sec. 361.198. ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL PENALTY. (a) A responsible party\nnamed in an administrative order who does not comply with the order is subject to\nthe imposition of administrative or civil penalties under Section 361.252. The\npenalties may be assessed only from the date after which the administrative order\nbecomes nonappealable.\n   (b) Tlte commission may include provisions within an agreed administrative order\nthat stipulate administrative penalty amount..<1 for failure to comply with the order.\n                                           74\n\f7lst LEGISLATURE-SIXTH CALLED SESSION                          Ch. 10, Art. 2, § 29\n\n The penalty provisions may be applicable to either or both the remedial investiga-\ntion/feasibility study and remedial action orders.\n   Sec. 3Sl.199. MIXED FUNDING PROGRAM. The commission by rule shall adopt\na mixed funding program in which available money from potentially responsible\nparties is combined with state or federal funds to dean up a facility in a timely\nmanner. Use of the state or federal funds in a miced funding approach does not\npreclude the state or federal government from seeking recovery of its costs from\nnonparticipating pot.mtially responsible parties.\n   Sec. 361.200. DE MIN/MIS SE'ITLEMENT. The commission shall assess and by\n rule may develop and implement a de minimis settlement program. Under the\nprogram, the commission shall consider the advantages of developing a final settle-\nment with potentially responsible parties that are responsible for only a minor\nportion of the response costs at a facility because tlte hazardous substances the party\nis responsible for are minimal in amount or in hazardous effect by comparison with\nthe hazardous substances attributable to other parties.\n   Sec. 361.201. FINANCIAL CAPABILITY AND FUNDING PRIORITY. (a) The\ncommission may determine whether a potentially responsible party is financially\ncapable of conducting any necessary remediation studies or remedial action. The\ncommission by rule shall adopt the criteria for determination offinancial capability.\n   (b) If no financially capable, potentially responsible parties exist for a facility, the\ncommission shall issue an administrative order stating its determination that the\nfacility constitutes an imminent and substantial endangerment and that there are no\nfinancially capable, potentially responsible parties. The commission shall then\nconduct its own remediation study and '!\"emedial action, using federal funds if\navailable, or, iffederal funds are not available, using state funds from the hazardous\n waste disposal fee fund.\n   (c) Generally, the remediation of listed facilities shall be achieved first by private\nparty funding, second with the aid offederal funds, and third, if necessary, with state\nfunds from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.\n   Sec. 361.202.
