The procedural history of this case and the details of Phippen’s claims are well-\n\fknown to the parties, set forth in the District Court’s thorough opinion, and need not be\n\ndiscussed at length. Briefly, Phippen filed a civil rights complaint alleging that appellees\n\nviolated his right to due process by placing him in segregation, tampering with his mail,\n\ndenying him access to the courts, and retaliating against him because he was challenging\n\nhis conviction.1 The District Court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1915A. Phippen filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n       Because Phippen is proceeding in forma pauperis on this appeal, we must analyze\n\nhis appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). Under § 1915\n\n(e)(2)(B), we must dismiss an appeal if the action (i) is frivolous or malicious, (ii) fails to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, or (iii) seeks monetary damages from a\n\ndefendant with immunity. When reviewing a complaint for failure to state a claim, the\n\nCourt must accept the allegations in the complaint as true. Hishon v. King & Spalding,\n\n467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984). The Court should not dismiss a complaint unless it is clear that\n\nno relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved. Id.\n\n       The District Court was correct that Phippen failed to state a due process claim, see\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995), or a claim under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.\n\n436 (1966). Renda v. King, 347 F.3d 550, 558 (3d Cir. 2003). The District Court did not\n\nerr in concluding that Nish and Jones cannot be held liable on the basis of respondeat\n\n\n  1\n    According to his § 2254 petition, Phippen is serving three and a half to fifteen years\nin prison for aggravated assault, simple assault, terroristic threats, reckless endangerment\nand stalking and harassing. The charges arose from an incident where Phippen held a\nknife to his wife’s throat and threatened to kill her in front of their daughter.\n                                               2\n\fsuperior, see Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988), and that SCI\n\nWaymart is not a “person” under § 1983. Fischer v. Cahill, 474 F.2d 991, 992 (3d Cir.\n\n1973).\n\n         Phippen has also requested that we issue a writ of mandamus. He describes recent\n\nmisconduct charges against him and requests that we compel the Pennsylvania\n\nDepartment of Corrections to use a disciplinary process that comports with case law. The\n\nwrit of mandamus will issue only in extraordinary circumstances. See Sporck v. Peil, 759\n\nF.2d 312, 314 (3d Cir. 1985). As a precondition to the issuance of the writ, the petitioner\n\nmust establish that there is no alternative remedy or other adequate means to obtain the\n\ndesired relief, and the petitioner must demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to the\n\nrelief sought. Kerr v. United States District Court, 426 U.S. 394, 403 (1976). Here\n\nPhippen has the alternative remedy of filing a complaint challenging the disciplinary\n\nprocedure in the proper District Court.2 We note also that Phippen has requested that the\n\nappeal be stayed because he does not have access to his legal materials. However,\n\nbecause no pleadings are required of Phippen, there is no need to stay the appeal.\n\n         For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will\n\ndismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state claim.\n\n\n\n  2\n    However, we note that, including the lower court action and this appeal, Phippen will\nnow have had three actions or appeals dismissed for failure to state a claim. See Phippen\nv. Lycoming County Jail, No. 01-cv-02040, (M.D. Pa. March 4, 2002). Thus, in the\nfuture he may only bring an action in forma pauperis as a prisoner if he is “under\nimminent danger of serious physical injury.” See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).\n                                               3\n\fPhippen’s request for mandamus relief is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f",
