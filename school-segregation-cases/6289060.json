A discovery request is overbroad when it covers matters\n\nbeyond those at issue in the case, and a central consideration in\n\ndetermining overbreadth is whether the request could have been more\n\nnarrowly tailored and still obtain pertinent information. In determining\n\nwhether a trial court clearly abused its discretion in regard to a discovery\n\norder, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for the trial\n\ncourt’s, and the relator must show that the trial court could reasonably\n\nhave reached only one decision. Even if that is shown, the relator must\n\nalso show that the remedy afforded by ordinary appeal is inadequate, by\n\nshowing that the discovery burdens the producing party far out of\n\nproportion to any benefit the requesting party may obtain. Has\n\nEnterprise shown that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by\n\nordering discovery pursuant to requests which are truly overbroad, and\n\nif so, has Enterprise shown that it lacks an adequate remedy by ordinary\n\nappeal?\n\n         2.   The party asserting a trade secret privilege as to information\n\nsought in discovery bears the burden to prove that the information is\n\ntrade secret. Information which another party may obtain by proper\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            x\n\fmeans, such as by contractually-authorized audit, cannot constitute a\n\ntrade secret as to that party. Also, under Texas Rule of Evidence 511(a),\n\nany trade secret privilege is waived by voluntary disclosure or consent to\n\ndisclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter, unless such\n\ndisclosure itself is privileged. Even when trade secret status is shown,\n\ndiscovery is appropriate when the requesting party demonstrates that\n\ndiscovery is reasonably necessary for a fair adjudication of the case,\n\nwhich turns on assessment of the particular circumstances. Here, where\n\nEnterprise expressly granted Magellan a contract right to audit and\n\nexamine all records necessary to determine Enterprise’s compliance with\n\nor breach of its contractual obligations to Magellan, and where\n\nEnterprise disclosed to Magellan some but not all information of the\n\nkinds it claims a privilege to withhold as trade secret, did Enterprise\n\nmeet its burden of proof, and if so, did Magellan show reasonable\n\nnecessity for the discovery? Relatedly, did the trial court clearly abuse its\n\ndiscretion by overruling Enterprise’s trade secret objections to production\n\nof the information actually encompassed by Magellan’s requests, or by\n\napproving the form of Protective Order it entered on January 8, 2018?\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           xi\n\f         3.   Magellan’s claims include, among others, breach of contract,\n\nfraud, and promissory estoppel. A court must construe a written contract\n\nin light of all surrounding facts and circumstances, and may consider\n\nthem as an aid in construction even when the court concludes that the\n\nlanguage of the contract is unambiguous. Here, the trial court has denied\n\nmotions in which Enterprise argued that the contract is unambiguous,\n\nbut has made no finding on that issue thus far. Nor has the trial court\n\ndetermined the merits of any claims Magellan asserts, including breach\n\nof contract, fraud, and promissory estoppel. Under these circumstances,\n\ndid the trial court clearly abuse its discretion by compelling Enterprise\n\nto produce any of the information Enterprise characterizes as parol\n\nevidence? And if so, has Enterprise also shown, as required, that such\n\ndiscovery burdens Enterprise far out of proportion to any benefit\n\nMagellan may obtain, such that Enterprise has no adequate remedy by\n\nordinary appeal?\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           xii\n\f                              INTRODUCTION\n\n         The claims Magellan alleges against Enterprise revolve around the\n\nparties’ Crude Oil Distribution Agreement dated October 31, 2011\n\n(“Distribution Agreement”), two related agreements between Magellan\n\nand Enterprise’s co-managed pipeline affiliate, Enterprise Crude\n\nPipeline LLC (“Enterprise Pipeline”), and representations Enterprise\n\nmade to Magellan in connection with those agreements.\n\n         In   the   Distribution   Agreement,   Enterprise   committed   to\n\n“exclusively utilize” Magellan’s Houston area crude oil distribution\n\nfacilities, for ten years, with respect to crude oil Enterprise markets from\n\ncertain “Origin Point” locations in the Eagle Ford Shale to certain\n\n“Destination Points” in the Houston area refining market. Enterprise\n\nmade that long-term commitment for the express purpose of inducing\n\nMagellan, its competitor, to invest heavily in expansion of Magellan’s\n\ndistribution system.\n\n         In reliance on the Enterprise commitment set forth in the\n\nDistribution Agreement, Magellan spent over $20 million to expand and\n\nimprove its distribution facilities as necessary to handle the volumes of\n\ncrude oil expected to be delivered by Enterprise. But instead of delivering\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             1\n\fon its commitment, Enterprise has employed various schemes designed\n\nto circumvent and evade its obligations to Magellan, causing damages\n\nestimated to be $50 million or more to date.\n\n         Magellan bargained for and obtained, in the Distribution\n\nAgreement, the right to periodically audit all records necessary to\n\ndetermine whether and to what extent Enterprise is in compliance with\n\nor in breach of its contractual obligations. On two occasions prior to suit,\n\nMagellan sought to do so, but in each instance Enterprise provided only\n\nsome of the documents and information required for a full audit.\n\nEnterprise claimed any other information regarding its shipments of\n\nEagle Ford crude oil is “irrelevant” to an assessment of contract\n\ncompliance.\n\n         This is because, in Enterprise’s professed view of the Distribution\n\nAgreement, Enterprise’s commitment to exclusively utilize the Magellan\n\ndistribution system is only triggered if and when (1) Enterprise chooses\n\nto retain ownership of crude oil after shipping it from one of the relevant\n\nEagle Ford “Origin Points” specified in the Distribution Agreement, and\n\n(2) Enterprise also chooses to deliver such crude oil to the Magellan\n\n“Connection Point” at Genoa Junction, the location where the\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             2\n\fDistribution Agreement specifies that crude oil must be delivered in order\n\nto enter into Magellan’s Houston area crude oil distribution system. See\n\nMR082-158, Pet., p. 4. In other words, according to Enterprise, the\n\nDistribution Agreement means that Enterprise is not committed to\n\nexclusively utilize Magellan’s facilities at all.\n\n         What is more, as further discussed below, the operating methods\n\nEnterprise claims it is currently using (and may have been using all\n\nalong) frustrate efforts to audit contract compliance because they make\n\nit hard to identify which barrels of crude oil came from a relevant Origin\n\nPoint, and trace where they wound up after Enterprise moved the barrels\n\nto its ECHO Terminal or another intermediate location downstream from\n\nthe Origin Point.\n\n         Shortly after answering Magellan’s Original Petition with a general\n\ndenial, Enterprise filed a summary judgment motion in which it urged\n\nthe trial court to enter judgment against Magellan on all claims, based\n\non Enterprise’s contract interpretation, which it argued is the only\n\nreasonable construction of the contract on its face. In its opposition,\n\nMagellan explained why Enterprise’s interpretation is not the only\n\nreasonable one, and indeed is unreasonable since it turns Enterprise’s\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             3\n\flong-term “commitment” into a unilateral option for Enterprise to use its\n\ncompetitor’s facilities whenever it chooses, rendering the “commitment”\n\nillusory and worthless to Magellan. SR073-340.1 After extensive briefing\n\nand oral argument, the trial court rejected Enterprise’s contention that\n\nits construction of the Distribution Agreement is the only reasonable one,\n\nand thus denied the motion for summary judgment. The trial court\n\ncontemporaneously denied Enterprise’s motion to stay all discovery\n\npursuant to the document production requests Magellan had already\n\nserved on Enterprise, and the document subpoenas it had issued to three\n\nnon-parties, clearing the path for discovery to proceed.\n\n         Undeterred, however, Enterprise refused to produce any documents\n\nrequested by Magellan and filed a second motion to quash Magellan’s\n\nsubpoenas. Following more rounds of briefing and oral argument on\n\nEnterprise’s second motion to quash, and Magellan’s motion to compel\n\nEnterprise, the trial court denied the motion to quash and granted in\n\nmajor part Magellan’s motion to compel. Still undeterred, Enterprise\n\nproduced only the same information previously provided for pre-suit\n\n\n\n1 The supplemental mandamus record is filed with this response and cited as\n“SR001.”\n\n\n{1789105;}                           4\n\faudits, and filed its Petition for Writ of Mandamus seeking relief\n\npreventing the vast majority of the discovery the trial court ordered. On\n\nJanuary 16, 2018, Enterprise filed its Amended Petition for Writ of\n\nMandamus.2\n\n         Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy appropriately reserved for\n\nexceptional cases where the relator demonstrates a clear abuse of the\n\ntrial court’s discretion and the lack of an adequate remedy by ordinary\n\nappeal. Enterprise has made no such showing here. Enterprise grossly\n\nexaggerates the scope of Magellan’s discovery requests to Enterprise and\n\nthe subpoenaed non-parties. In truth, all of them are carefully tailored to\n\nobtain information relevant to the subject matter of the action as alleged\n\nin Magellan’s Original Petition. None of the discovery now compelled or\n\nallowed by the trial court’s discovery orders is overbroad or amounts to\n\nimpermissible discovery of parol evidence.\n\n         In the trial court, Enterprise failed to meet its burden to show that\n\nany information actually responsive to Magellan’s discovery requests, as\n\nwritten, is trade secret information Enterprise could be presumptively\n\n\n\n2 The Amended Petition supersedes the original petition and is hereafter cited as\n“Pet.”\n\n\n{1789105;}                              5\n\fprivileged to withhold from Magellan. It does not, because all such\n\ninformation is within the scope of the audit right Enterprise granted to\n\nMagellan, and thus cannot be kept secret from Magellan. Additionally,\n\nthough it was not required, Magellan showed a reasonable necessity for\n\ndiscovery of responsive information, if any, that might qualify as trade\n\nsecret information outside the scope of Magellan’s audit right.\n\n         In this Court, Enterprise fails to demonstrate that any aspect of the\n\ntrial court’s discovery orders is a clear abuse of the trial court’s broad\n\ndiscretion in matters of discovery, and also fails to show the lack of an\n\nadequate remedy by appeal, as required to warrant mandamus in any\n\ncase.\n\n                          STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n         Magellan is an affiliate of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P., a\n\npublicly traded partnership that primarily transports, stores and\n\ndistributes petroleum products including crude oil. Magellan owns and\n\noperates pipelines and related facilities for transportation and\n\ndistribution of crude oil, including facilities in the Houston, Texas area,\n\nthrough which crude oil is transported and distributed to refineries or\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                              6\n\fother destinations on the Houston ship channel, in Texas City, or at other\n\nlocations on the Texas Gulf Coast. MR001.\n\n         Enterprise is a crude oil marketing company which purchases crude\n\noil from third parties and generates revenues from marketing, storing\n\nand transporting such crude oil in Texas and Oklahoma. As a crude oil\n\nmarketing company, Enterprise purchases crude oil produced by third\n\nparties and ships it on pipelines Enterprise selects, to destinations\n\nEnterprise selects. In Texas, Enterprise purchases and markets crude oil\n\nproduced in, among other regions, the South Texas production region\n\nknown as the Eagle Ford Shale. MR002.\n\n         Enterprise Pipeline, an affiliate of Enterprise, owns or operates\n\nnumerous pipeline facilities in Texas including an Eagle Ford-to-Houston\n\narea pipeline system through which much of the Eagle Ford crude oil\n\nproduction purchased and marketed by Enterprise is transported and\n\nultimately delivered to various Gulf Coast refineries and terminals\n\nincluding ones located along the Houston Ship Channel or in Texas City,\n\nTexas. MR002.\n\n         Enterprise and Enterprise Pipeline, as constituents of Enterprise\n\nProducts Partners L.P. (“EPP”)—which is one of the largest publicly\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            7\n\ftraded midstream energy partnerships in the United States—are jointly\n\nmanaged by Enterprise Crude GP LLC. MR003.\n\nI.       EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN EAGLE FORD PRODUCTION LEADS               TO\n         AGREEMENTS BETWEEN COMPETITORS\n\n         By 2010, midstream energy companies like Enterprise and\n\nMagellan foresaw rapid growth in Eagle Ford Shale crude oil production,\n\nand thus also needs and opportunities for expansions of pipelines and\n\nother midstream distribution systems to move increasing volumes of\n\nEagle Ford crude oil to refining markets in or near Houston. MR007. In\n\n2010, Magellan acquired more than 100 miles of Houston area pipeline\n\nassets that greatly increased its capacity to deliver crude oil to Houston\n\nShip Channel refineries and refineries located in Texas City. MR008. At\n\nabout the same time in 2010, EPP announced plans to construct a large\n\nnew pipeline which would originate in the Eagle Ford Shale and be\n\ncapable of transporting Eagle Ford crude oil to Houston area refining\n\nmarkets by connecting to Enterprise Pipeline’s existing Rancho Pipeline,\n\nwhich extended directly to the Genoa Junction connection point with\n\nMagellan’s Houston area distribution system. MR008.\n\n         In December 2010, Enterprise Pipeline and Magellan entered into\n\nan agreement to combine, under a single transportation tariff, a 40-mile\n\n\n{1789105;}                           8\n\fsegment of Enterprise Pipeline’s Rancho Pipeline with the 26-mile\n\nsegment of Magellan’s Genoa Junction-to-Texas City pipeline. MR012.\n\nEPP’s public announcement noted that this agreement “represents an\n\nimportant first step towards working together on future opportunities\n\ndesigned to improve market access” and “complements our Eagle Ford\n\nShale crude oil strategy that includes Enterprise’s recently announced\n\nplans to construct a new crude oil storage facility and pipelines in\n\nsoutheast Houston that will receive deliveries from the Rancho system\n\nand provide the capability to deliver into the nearby Magellan pipeline.”\n\nMR012.\n\n         The planned “new crude oil facility and pipelines,” which EPP\n\npublicly disclosed to be part of its Eagle Ford crude oil strategy, referred\n\nto (1) the new Enterprise terminal facility known as ECHO Terminal,\n\nlocated approximately three miles southeast of Magellan’s Genoa\n\nJunction connection point, and (2) two new pipelines that would provide\n\nbi-directional transportation of crude oil between ECHO Terminal and\n\nMagellan’s facilities originating at Genoa Junction. MR009-011.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           9\n\fII.      IN 2011, ENTERPRISE AND ENTERPRISE PIPELINE ENTER INTO\n         ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH MAGELLAN FOR DISTRIBUTION OF\n         EAGLE FORD CRUDE OIL TO HOUSTON AREA DESTINATIONS\n\n         During the first half of 2011, as EPP was proceeding to enlarge its\n\nfootprint in the Eagle Ford Shale, Magellan was also considering further\n\nexpansion and improvement of its Houston area crude oil distribution\n\nsystem, subject to securing a long-term contractual commitment assuring\n\nthe commercial viability of such a capital-intensive project. MR013-014.\n\n         Around mid-year, Magellan and Enterprise began exploring a\n\npossible agreement that would benefit both companies by utilizing their\n\ncomplementary assets for marketing, transportation and distribution of\n\nEagle Ford crude oil to Houston area destinations. MR015. At the time,\n\nEnterprise was rapidly growing its business of purchasing crude oil\n\nproduced in the Eagle Ford Shale play and marketing it to refineries in\n\nthe Houston area, whereas Magellan had recently acquired Houston area\n\npipelines and related facilities that increased its capacity to distribute,\n\nto area refineries, crude oil entering into Magellan’s distribution system\n\nat Genoa Junction. See illustrations at MR009, MR012. Notwithstanding\n\nseveral public announcements about its strategic plans to expand its own\n\nfacilities (MR009-012), Enterprise represented to Magellan that\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            10\n\fEnterprise had a need and desire to use Magellan’s Houston area crude\n\noil distribution facilities in order to deliver burgeoning volumes of Eagle\n\nFord production to destinations in the Houston area refining markets.\n\nMR015.\n\n         Following several months of contract negotiations, Magellan\n\nentered into: (1) the Distribution Agreement with Enterprise, (2) the\n\nJoint Tariff Agreement with Enterprise Pipeline, and (3) the Connection\n\nAgreement with Enterprise Pipeline. MR018-022.\n\n         In the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise made a 10-year\n\n“commitment” to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s Houston area crude oil\n\ntransportation and distribution facilities for transportation of certain\n\n“Product”3 Enterprise buys in the Eagle Ford Shale and markets to\n\nHouston area refineries. MR018-019. Specifically, under Section 4.1 of\n\nthe Distribution Agreement, Enterprise committed that for all Product\n\nEnterprise owns or controls at any defined Eagle Ford “Origin Point” and\n\ntransports on its affiliate’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston area pipeline system\n\nfor ultimate marketing (delivery) to any defined Houston area\n\n\n3The Distribution Agreement defines “Product” as “crude oil and condensate meeting\nthe specifications provided for in the Joint Tariff, as such tariff may be supplemented,\namended or reissued from time to time.” MR042.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                11\n\f“Destination Point,” Enterprise would “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s\n\nnew and improved Houston area crude oil distribution system, pursuant\n\nto the agreed “joint tariff” (transportation fee). MR044.\n\n         The   Distribution   Agreement   specifically   referred   to   and\n\nincorporated the Joint Tariff Agreement between Enterprise Pipeline\n\nand Magellan, providing that “[t]ransportation services under this\n\nAgreement are subject to, and the Parties are required to comply with,\n\nthe provisions of the Joint Tariff.” MR041, MR043. The Joint Tariff\n\nAgreement expressed Enterprise’s transportation commitment as\n\nfollows: “[T]he shipper [Enterprise] agrees to ship under the Joint Tariff\n\nall crude owned or controlled by it from an Origin Point through the\n\nConnection Point to a Destination Point.” MR041, MR043.\n\n         To implement the transportation commitment Enterprise made to\n\nMagellan under the Distribution Agreement, it was necessary for\n\nEnterprise Pipeline and Magellan to construct certain new or improved\n\nconnections between their respective distribution systems. So, under the\n\nConnection Agreement, Enterprise Pipeline agreed to construct facilities\n\nwhich would enable it to deliver Product from Enterprise Pipeline’s new\n\nECHO-to-Genoa Junction pipelines into Magellan’s distribution system\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          12\n\foriginating at the Genoa Junction connection point; and Magellan agreed\n\nto construct facilities which would enable it to receive such deliveries\n\nfrom Enterprise Pipeline, at either of the two Genoa Junction\n\ninterconnection points included in the definition of “Connection Point”\n\nset forth in the Distribution Agreement and the Joint Tariff Agreement.\n\nMR021-022.\n\nIII. AFTER INDUCING MAGELLAN TO INVEST HEAVILY IN NEW\n     FACILITIES, ENTERPRISE REFUSES TO UTILIZE THEM AS AGREED\n\n         The Distribution Agreement expressly stated that the purpose of\n\nEnterprise’s long-term commitment to make “exclusive use” of\n\nMagellan’s distribution system was to “facilitate” (i.e., induce) Magellan’s\n\ncostly expansion of its facilities as necessary for Magellan to handle the\n\nEagle Ford crude oil transportation business Enterprise committed to\n\nMagellan. MR039. Following execution of the parties’ 2011 agreements,\n\nand in reliance upon them, Magellan invested over $20 million to\n\nconstruct the “New Magellan Facilities” described in the Distribution\n\nAgreement, and did all of the connection work necessary to receive the\n\nanticipated Enterprise deliveries of Product from Enterprise Pipeline’s\n\nRancho Pipeline and ECHO-to-Genoa Junction pipelines into Magellan’s\n\nexpanded Houston area distribution system originating at Magellan’s\n\n\n{1789105;}                          13\n\fGenoa Junction Connection Point with those pipelines. MR023.\n\nMagellan’s facilities were connected and capable of receiving Enterprise\n\nProduct at the specified Genoa Junction Connection Point as of July 1,\n\n2013, the duly noticed “In-Service Date” on which Enterprise’s 10-year\n\ncommitment to “exclusively utilize” the Magellan facilities began.\n\nMR023.\n\n         However, from the In-Service Date to the present, Enterprise has\n\nfailed and refused to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s facilities in\n\naccordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement. MR024.\n\nAlthough the parties disagree about the meaning of the transportation\n\ncommitment Enterprise made in the Distribution Agreement, and thus\n\nthe scope of Eagle Ford Product covered by Enterprise’s obligation to\n\nmake exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities, there is no dispute that from\n\nthe In-Service Date to present Enterprise has purchased and marketed\n\nhundreds of millions of barrels of Eagle Ford Product which were not\n\ntransported through Magellan’s Houston area distribution system to a\n\nspecified Destination Point. MR029.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           14\n\fIV.      ENTERPRISE REBUFFS MAGELLAN’S ATTEMPTS TO AUDIT\n         ENTERPRISE PURSUANT TO MAGELLAN’S CONTRACT AUDIT RIGHTS\n\n         No rational company in Magellan’s position would invest tens of\n\nmillions of dollars to expand and improve its facilities, on the strength of\n\na major competitor’s long-term contractual commitment to exclusively\n\nutilize those facilities (in lieu of, for example, similar facilities the\n\ncompetitor owns or has publicly announced its intention to develop),\n\nwithout obtaining a robust right to audit the competitor as necessary to\n\nfully determine and fully verify the competitor’s compliance with or\n\nbreach of its commitment. Magellan bargained for and obtained that very\n\nright.\n\n         In Section 4.4 of the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise agreed\n\nthat “Magellan shall have the right to audit Shipper’s records necessary\n\nto verify Shipper’s compliance with the provisions of Section 4.1\n\n[the         transportation   commitment]   and    4.2   [transportation\n\ncommitment exceptions].” MR045 (emphasis added). This bargained-\n\nfor audit right is quite broad, and necessarily so. For one thing, under\n\nSection 4.1 of the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise (the Shipper) not\n\nonly committed itself to “exclusively utilize” the Magellan Facilities but\n\nalso committed to “use best efforts to cause Shipper’s Affiliates [e.g.,\n\n\n{1789105;}                           15\n\fEnterprise Pipeline] to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities.”\n\nMR044. In addition, Enterprise’s transportation commitment hinges on\n\ncertain variables, such as: whether and what “Product” the Shipper, or\n\nan “Affiliate” of the Shipper, either owns or controls, at an Eagle Ford\n\n“Origin Point;” whether such Product is transported on the “Enterprise\n\nPipeline” or some other pipeline; and whether and to what extent such\n\nProduct is transported for ultimate delivery to any “Destination Point.”\n\nMR044. Consequently, properly auditing and verifying compliance with\n\nor breach of such a commitment is an inevitably complex process which\n\ncould and does require access to and examination of many different types\n\nand sources of documents and data which Enterprise maintains in or\n\nthrough methods and systems unknown or unfamiliar to Magellan, and\n\nwhich can change over time.\n\n         Under such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that Enterprise\n\nvoluntarily granted Magellan such a broadly-worded right to audit.4 Nor\n\nis it surprising, although it is important, that the audit right Enterprise\n\n\n\n4 Although Section 4.4 of the Distribution Agreement is titled “Magellan’s Limited\nRight to Audit and Penalty,” the stated limitations concern only the timing, location,\nand costs of audits, not the scope of the information Magellan is entitled to examine\nfor purposes of auditing Enterprise’s compliance with its transportation commitment\nto Magellan. See MR045.\n\n\n{1789105;}                               16\n\fexpressly granted Magellan does not exclude or exempt from audit any\n\nparticular types or categories of documents or information, such as\n\ndocuments or information Enterprise may deem to be confidential or even\n\n“trade secret.” What is surprising, and alarming, is how Enterprise\n\nresponded to Magellan’s two pre-suit attempts to audit Enterprise’s\n\ncontract compliance, and how (as discussed below) it has responded to\n\nMagellan’s requests for discovery in this action.\n\n         In the spring of 2015, Magellan sought its first contract compliance\n\naudit. This audit revealed that immediately after Enterprise signed the\n\nDistribution Agreement with Magellan, Enterprise began replacing its\n\nEagle Ford marketing contracts—under which Enterprise controlled or\n\nwould control Product distribution and delivery from end-to-end of the\n\ntransport from Origin Point to Destination Point—with buy-sell\n\ncontracts, under which Enterprise buys volumes of crude oil at the Origin\n\nPoint, transports it to Enterprise’s ECHO Terminal, and resells the same\n\nvolumes to the same customers once the crude oil reaches ECHO\n\nTerminal. MR026. The first audit also revealed other operating methods\n\nEnterprise uses to complicate tracing and fully accounting for the\n\ntransportation and ultimate delivery of all Eagle Ford Product\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            17\n\fEnterprise owns or controls at an Origin Point. For example: (1)\n\nEnterprise batches a common stream barrel at the Origin Point and\n\nresells a common stream barrel at a downstream destination such as\n\nECHO Terminal, but says it does not tie the barrels Enterprise owns at\n\nthe Origin Point to the barrels it resells to the same customer at the\n\ndownstream location;5 and (2) Enterprise says that after reselling Eagle\n\nFord barrels to a customer at ECHO Terminal or another intermediate\n\nlocation downstream from the Origin Point, Enterprise does not track the\n\ncustomer’s subsequent transportation to a Destination Point or any other\n\nfinal destination. MR090-091, MR243, SR378, SR489-533.6\n\n         For Magellan’s first audit, Enterprise provided only part of the\n\ninformation needed to fully audit its compliance with or breach of the\n\nDistribution Agreement, e.g., only three of its Eagle Ford buy-sell\n\n\n\n5 As Enterprise puts it: “Crude is not segregated at ECHO based on the crude’s origin;\nit is aggregated there based on quality with crude from various sources, and there is\nno way to determine whether any particular batch of crude purchased at\nECHO was produced from an Origin Point.” SR378 (emphasis added).\n6 However, Enterprise has also made assertions inconsistent with the above. For\ninstance, it has claimed that certain barrels were delivered through Enterprise\nfacilities (not Magellan facilities) based on transportation nominations made by\nEnterprise’s customers, and that some Product was transported by a customer from\nECHO Terminal to a designated Destination Point, but not through the Magellan\nfacilities, allegedly because that was “not the most direct routing” (which, even if true,\ndoes not exempt the barrels from Enterprise’s commitment). SR489-533.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                 18\n\fcontracts (and only one of the related marketing contracts replaced with\n\nthe buy-sell contract), and only certain incomplete or indecipherable\n\ntransactional reports regarding Eagle Ford Product Enterprise owned or\n\ncontrolled at an Origin Point and transported to its ECHO Terminal.\n\nMR322.\n\n         In 2017, Magellan attempted a second audit, regarding Enterprise’s\n\ncontract compliance during 2016. For purposes of this audit, Magellan\n\nrequested records which, in light of what was learned through the first\n\naudit, were plainly required in order to thoroughly and completely audit\n\nand determine the extent of Enterprise’s compliance or breach of its\n\nobligations under the Distribution Agreement. This included complete\n\ntransactional data regarding transportation and delivery of Eagle Ford\n\nProduct Enterprise owned or controlled at an Origin Point (not any\n\nother Enterprise-owned crude oil) and records showing whether\n\nEnterprise replaced its pre-Distribution Agreement Eagle Ford\n\nmarketing contracts with post-Distribution Agreement buy-sell contracts\n\nfor good faith business reasons or in a bad faith effort to evade its\n\nobligation to make exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities. MR353-356.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            19\n\f         In response, Enterprise provided essentially the same kinds of\n\ntransaction data (for 2016 Product shipments) it had provided for\n\nMagellan’s first audit, with the same limitations and gaps preventing\n\nMagellan from identifying and tracing the transportation and delivery of\n\nall volumes of crude oil Enterprise owned or controlled and transported\n\nfrom an Eagle Ford Origin Point to a final destination beyond ECHO\n\nTerminal or a similar intermediate location. Enterprise also refused to\n\nprovide any of its other Eagle Ford marketing agreements, buy-sell\n\nagreements, or transportation agreements. MR322.\n\n         The reason Enterprise gave for refusing to provide Magellan with\n\nall records “necessary to verify Shipper’s compliance” was not that any\n\nsuch records constitute “trade secrets” that, despite the broad audit right\n\nEnterprise granted in the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise is\n\nprivileged to withhold from Magellan. MR322. In fact, although\n\nEnterprise provided information under a confidentiality agreement—one\n\nthat permits the information to be reviewed by any Magellan\n\nrepresentative who has “a legitimate need to review and evaluate the\n\nConfidential Information to assist Recipient [Magellan] in connection\n\nwith the Audit” and permits Magellan to use Confidential Information\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           20\n\ffor any “purposes related to the Audit” (MR468)—Enterprise never\n\nclaimed (and still does not claim) that any of the “Confidential\n\nInformation” it actually provided for audit is Enterprise “trade secret”\n\ninformation. MR319, MR322. Instead, based on the same erroneous\n\ninterpretation     of   the   Distribution   Agreement   that   Enterprise’s\n\nsubsequent motion for summary judgment unsuccessfully urged the trial\n\ncourt to adopt as a matter of law, Enterprise claimed that the rest of the\n\ninformation Magellan sought for audit is simply irrelevant.\n\nV.       ENTERPRISE ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK ALL MAGELLAN DISCOVERY IN\n         THE ACTION\n\n         On June 19, 2017, Magellan filed its factually detailed 36-page\n\nOriginal Petition, alleging claims for (among other things) breach of the\n\nDistribution Agreement, promissory estoppel, and fraud. MR001-078.\n\nShortly after Enterprise answered with a general denial (MR079-081),\n\nMagellan served its first document requests to Enterprise (MR271) and\n\nissued subpoenas to the three non-parties who were counterparties to the\n\nthree Eagle Ford buy-sell contracts Enterprise disclosed during\n\nMagellan’s first audit (MR196-236). The requests to Enterprise sought\n\ndocuments relevant to the subject matter of the action, including\n\ndocuments relevant to Enterprise’s liability for all claims alleged in the\n\n\n{1789105;}                            21\n\fOriginal Petition, and to a determination of Magellan’s damages. The\n\nnon-party subpoenas sought all relevant “Eagle Ford Product” 7 contracts\n\nwith Enterprise (including those Enterprise claimed not to have),\n\nrelevant communications with Enterprise regarding those contracts, and\n\nthe non-parties’ own basic transactional data regarding the purchase,\n\nsale, transportation and delivery of Eagle Ford Product sold to Enterprise\n\nat an Origin Point and/or bought back from Enterprise pursuant to a buy-\n\nsell contract. SR341-366.\n\n         Enterprise then launched, and for five months has maintained, a\n\nwithering campaign to stop Magellan’s suit in its tracks, without any\n\nmeaningful discovery from Enterprise or anyone else. Specifically,\n\nEnterprise: (1) sought summary judgment on all of Magellan’s claims,\n\nbased on Enterprise’s faulty interpretation of the Distribution\n\nAgreement (MR082-158) (motion denied); (2) moved to stay all discovery\n\npending determination of its summary judgment motion (SR001-072)\n\n\n\n7 The non-party subpoenas clearly and carefully defined “Eagle Ford Product,” to be\nlimited to crude oil and/or condensate the non-party sold to Enterprise, or delivered\nto Enterprise for transportation, at one of the Eagle Ford Origin Points specified in\nthe Distribution Agreement. Ironically, Enterprise scoffs that this and other\ndefinitions Magellan included in its subpoenas or its requests to Enterprise—all of\nwhich were carefully designed to avoid confusion or overbreadth—were “made-up” by\nMagellan. Pet., pp. 7, 12.\n\n\n{1789105;}                               22\n\f(motion denied); (3) after those two motions were denied, (a) objected to\n\nevery one of Magellan’s discovery requests and refused to produce\n\nanything to Magellan (MR287), and (b) filed another motion to quash the\n\nnon-party subpoenas (MR160-236) (motion denied); (4) opposed\n\nMagellan’s motion to compel Enterprise to produce documents responsive\n\nto Magellan’s requests (MR390-473) (motion granted in major part); (5)\n\non the eve of the hearing on Magellan’s motion to compel, served\n\namended objections and responses in which Enterprise asserted new\n\nobjections and substantially altered others (SR426-516) (objections\n\noverruled); (6) moved for entry of a protective order containing draconian\n\nprovisions that, unlike the audit-related Confidentiality Agreement\n\ndiscussed above, would preclude any Magellan personnel from reviewing\n\nany information Enterprise is compelled to produce but claims is trade\n\nsecret or “highly confidential” (MR474-575); and (7) filed its Petition for\n\nWrit of Mandamus.\n\n         Enterprise’s relentless efforts to prevent this case from moving\n\nforward have failed, and with good reason. The trial court’s rulings to\n\ndate—though not yet effective in breaking Enterprise’s unilateral\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           23\n\fembargo on discovery—have been well-considered and lawful, and by no\n\nmeans an abuse of discretion in any respect.\n\n                              ARGUMENT\n\nI.       ENTERPRISE HAS NOT SHOWN ANY RIGHT TO MANDAMUS RELIEF\n         ON THE GROUND THAT THE TRIAL COURT COMPELLED DISCOVERY\n         PURSUANT TO OVERBROAD REQUESTS\n\n         Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 192.3 entitles a party to obtain\n\ndiscovery “regarding any matter that is not privileged and is relevant to\n\nthe subject matter of the pending action,” whether or not the information\n\nwill be admissible at trial, as long as the information sought “appears\n\nreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(a). The phrases “relevant to the subject matter” and\n\n“reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence” are liberally\n\nconstrued to allow litigants to obtain the fullest knowledge of the facts\n\nand issues prior to trial. Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, 279 S.W.3d 656, 664\n\n(Tex. 2009); Axelson v. McIlhany, 798 S.W.2d 550, 553 (Tex. 1990); In re\n\nExmark Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.W.3d 519, 526 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n2009) (orig. proceeding). The scope of discovery is largely within the trial\n\ncourt's discretion. In re Colonial Pipeline Co., 968 S.W.2d 938, 941 (Tex.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          24\n\f1998) (orig. proceeding) (citing Dillard Dept. Stores, Inc. v. Hall, 909\n\nS.W.2d 491, 492 (Tex. 1995)).\n\n         A discovery request is overbroad only when it covers “time periods,\n\nproducts, or activities beyond those at issue in the case.” In re Waste\n\nMgmt. of Texas, Inc., 392 S.W.3d 861, 871 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2013)\n\n(orig. proceeding) (emphasis added). “A specific request for discovery\n\nreasonably tailored to include only matters relevant to the case is not\n\noverbroad merely because the request may call for some information of\n\ndoubtful relevance. Parties must have some latitude in fashioning proper\n\ndiscovery requests.” Texaco, Inc. v. Sanderson, 898 S.W.2d 813, 815 (Tex.\n\n1995). That is, “[a] central consideration in determining overbreadth is\n\nwhether the request could have been more narrowly tailored to avoid\n\nincluding tenuous information and still obtain the necessary, pertinent\n\ninformation.” In re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d 149, 153 (Tex. 2003) (orig.\n\nproceeding). And “[w]hen it is not self-evident that the discovery order is\n\noverly broad, the party resisting the discovery bears the burden of\n\noffering evidence to prove its objections.” In re Exmark Mfg. Co., Inc., 299\n\nS.W.3d at 524 (citations omitted)).\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            25\n\f         Since “[m]andamus is an extraordinary proceeding, encompassing\n\nan extraordinary remedy,” appellate courts exercise mandamus power\n\n“sparingly and deliberately” and only where the decision is “a clear abuse\n\nof discretion devoid of any guiding principles of law.” Deloitte & Touche,\n\nLLP v. Fourteenth Court of Appeals, 951 S.W.2d 394, 396 (Tex. 1997). A\n\ntrial court commits an abuse of discretion when its action is “so arbitrary\n\nand unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law.”\n\nIn re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d at 151 (quoting CSR Ltd. v. Link, 925 S.W.2d\n\n591, 596 (Tex. 1996)). See Gordon v. Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 250\n\nS.W.3d 196, 199 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.) (same). The party\n\nresisting discovery has the heavy burden to show an abuse of discretion\n\nunder this stringent standard. In re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d at 151.\n\n         Regarding discovery orders in particular, “the discretionary nature\n\nof discovery and the amorphous notion of relevancy most often counsels\n\nagainst appellate court intervention into the discovery process.” Gordon\n\nv. Blackmon, 675 S.W.2d 790, 793 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1984) (orig.\n\nproceeding) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nSpecifically, “[i]n considering whether a trial court has clearly abused its\n\ndiscretion with regard to a discovery order, the reviewing court may not\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            26\n\fsubstitute its judgment for that of the trial court and the relator must\n\nestablish that the trial court could reasonably have reached only one\n\ndecision.” In re Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 437 S.W.3d 923, 927 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2014) (orig. proceeding) (citations and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). See In re Master Flo Valve Inc., 485 S.W.3d 207, 213\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2016) (orig. proceeding) (same). Finally,\n\n“[i]n determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, we are\n\nmindful that the ultimate purpose of discovery is to seek the truth, so\n\nthat disputes may be decided by what the facts reveal, not by what facts\n\nare concealed.” In re Nolle, 265 S.W.3d 487, 491 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2008) (orig. proceeding) (citing cases).\n\n         Even when the party seeking mandamus relief meets the heavy\n\nburden of showing a clear abuse of discretion, it must also demonstrate\n\nthat the remedy afforded by ordinary appeal is inadequate. Walker v.\n\nPacker, 827 S.W.2d 833, 842 (Tex. 1992). And importantly, “an appellate\n\nremedy is not inadequate merely because it may involve more expense or\n\ndelay than obtaining an extraordinary writ.” Id. To establish inadequate\n\nremedy, the party seeking mandamus relief from a discovery order\n\ncompelling production must prove that the order “compels the production\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           27\n\fof patently irrelevant or duplicative documents, such that it clearly\n\nconstitutes harassment or imposes a burden on the producing party far\n\nout of proportion to any benefit that may obtain to the requesting\n\nparty.” Id. at 843 (emphasis added). In other words, contrary to\n\nEnterprise’s contention, even proof that a discovery order compels\n\nproduction of “patently irrelevant” documents (which Enterprise has not\n\nshown)       does   not   automatically     satisfy   the    inadequate      remedy\n\nrequirement; the relator must also demonstrate that the order\n\nconstitutes harassment or burdens the producing party far out of\n\nproportion to the benefit to the requesting party.8\n\n\n8 Enterprise relies (Pet., p. 20) on a quotation from In re CSX Corp. that for such an\norder, there is no adequate remedy on appeal “because the order ‘imposes a burden\non the party far out proportion to the benefit that may obtain to the requesting\nparty.’” In re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d at 153 (emphasis added) (citing and internally\nquoting Walker). But Walker does not support the view that any order compelling\nproduction of “patently irrelevant” documents necessarily imposes such a burden far\nout of proportion to the benefit. Rather, Walker shows, and logically so, that in such\ncases the assessment of adequate remedy involves a case-by-case balancing of\ndemonstrated burden versus benefit. In In re CSX Corp., the burden far outweighed\nthe benefit because the plaintiff’s interrogatories at issue sought names and\naddresses of all safety personnel the defendants employed over a 30-year period,\nextending 25 years beyond the plaintiff’s employment period. Id. Cf. In re Deere &\nCo., 299 S.W.3d 819, 821 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding) (inadequate remedy shown in\nproducts liability case where reviewing court found discovery ordered as to 30 product\nlines was overbroad and could require production of documents “going back decades”);\nIn re Weekly Homes, L.P., 295 S.W.3d 309, 323 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding) (citing\nWalker, and finding remedy by appeal would be inadequate because burden of\nproducing employees’ computer hard drives far outweighed benefit of discovery).\n\n\n{1789105;}                               28\n\f         A.    NONE OF MAGELLAN’S REQUESTS                  TO   ENTERPRISE   ARE\n               OVERBROAD\n\n         Enterprise leads its argument by pointing to Magellan’s Request\n\nNo. 10—which it says “typifies the overbreadth” (Pet., p. 22) of Magellan’s\n\nrequests—asserting that the documents sought have “no apparent\n\nconnection” to the issues in the case. (Pet., p. 23). That is plainly wrong.\n\n         Magellan       alleges   that,        consistent    with    Enterprise’s\n\nrepresentations, the Enterprise transportation commitment set forth in\n\nthe Distribution Agreement applies to all Product (crude oil and\n\ncondensate) which is owned by Enterprise at any of the defined Origin\n\nPoints, transported on its Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system, and\n\ndelivered to any of the defined Destination Points in the Houston area\n\nmarket. MR001. Based on information it discovered through pre-suit\n\naudit, Magellan also alleges that Enterprise is deliberately skirting its\n\ncontractual commitment, in various ways (e.g., replacing pre-contract\n\nmarketing agreements with post-contract buy-sell agreements, and\n\nidling its Rancho I pipeline and using its Rancho II pipeline to bypass the\n\nMagellan’s Connection Point9) which not only breach the contract but\n\n\n\n\n9   See SR074 for illustration.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                29\n\falso indicate that Enterprise never intended to perform its obligation to\n\n“exclusively utilize” Magellan’s Houston area distribution system\n\noriginating at the Genoa Junction Connection Point.\n\n         Request No. 10 calls for Enterprise business plans, projections,\n\nstatistics and the like regarding its marketing, transportation or delivery\n\nof “Eagle Ford Product” only, i.e., only Product which Enterprise owns or\n\ncontrols at a specified Origin Point and is subject to the transportation\n\ncommitment contained in the Distribution Agreement. Enterprise’s\n\ncomplaint that Request No. 10 references items pertaining to marketing\n\nor delivery of Eagle Ford Product to ECHO Terminal, Genoa Junction, or\n\nother Houston Area Destinations is unfounded, and ironic, because such\n\nspecific references reasonably limit the scope of the request so that it does\n\nnot seek information pertaining to any Eagle Ford Product that does not\n\nmove to Houston on the Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline and, therefore,\n\nis not subject to the Distribution Agreement. The requested information\n\nis also reasonably limited to the time period during which Distribution\n\nAgreement has been in effect.\n\n         Documents responsive to Request No. 10 are highly relevant to\n\nmultiple issues in the case, such as: whether Enterprise misled Magellan\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           30\n\fabout Enterprise’s purported need, desire, and intent to make exclusive\n\nuse of Magellan’s facilities; whether Enterprise ever planned or expected\n\nto do so; whether, at the time Enterprise induced Magellan to invest in\n\nexpanded facilities and new connections between the competitors’\n\nrespective facilities, Enterprise was already using or planning to use\n\noperating methods designed to evade its commitment and/or frustrate\n\nMagellan’s ability to audit compliance with that commitment; and\n\nwhether, when and why Enterprise’s needs, plans or expectations\n\nchanged after it signed the Distribution Agreement (e.g., whether\n\nchanges were made in order to evade the transportation commitment,\n\nwhich the law forbids (see MR253)).\n\n         Next, Enterprise contends that Request Nos. 17-23 are overbroad\n\nbecause they seek information about “every customer contract for Eagle\n\nFord Crude.” (Pet., p. 24). That is also incorrect. First, given the scope-\n\nlimiting definitions used, all of these requests pertain only to contracts\n\ncovering crude oil or condensate purchased, sold or transported from one\n\nof the Origin Points identified in the Distribution Agreement. Second,\n\nthey are all reasonably limited in time, to the period from 2011 (when\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          31\n\fEnterprise began entering into the marketing agreements it later\n\nreplaced with buy-sell agreements) to present.\n\n         Documents responsive to Request Nos. 17-23 are relevant to the\n\nsame issues and matters discussed above, in particular whether the\n\ncontracts resulted from customer demands (as Enterprise claims, see\n\nMR090-091, SR489-533) or from Enterprise’s own bad faith attempts to\n\nstructure deals so as to evade its commitment to make exclusive use of\n\nMagellan’s facilities, and instead promote the use of Enterprise’s\n\nfacilities. Enterprise acknowledged the relevance of such contracts when\n\nit provided three buy-sell agreements and one of the related marketing\n\nagreements it replaced with a buy-sell agreement.\n\n         Last, Enterprise claims that Request Nos. 24-26 and 28-29 are\n\noverbroad on the ground that they seek information about “Future\n\nDestination Points” (a term defined in the Distribution Agreement) “that\n\nMagellan has never put into service.” (Pet., p. 24). However, Enterprise\n\nhas not proved that assertion, and cannot because it is false. It is true\n\nthat Request Nos. 28-29 seek information about crude transportation\n\nfrom ECHO Terminal to any Destination Point or Future Destination\n\nPoint, but do not tie that to barrels which came from an Origin Point.\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          32\n\fHowever, that is only because Enterprise states that the barrels it\n\ntransports from an Origin Point are being batched, are not tied or\n\nmatched to the barrels it resells at ECHO Terminal, and thus cannot be\n\nspecifically identified or traced from ECHO Terminal to the ultimate\n\ndelivery point. MR090-091, MR243, SR378, SR489-533. In this\n\ncircumstance, the information sought by Request Nos. 28-29 is obviously\n\nrelevant to identify and quantify, by some appropriate means, the\n\nProduct Enterprise should have delivered through Magellan’s facilities.\n\n         None of Enterprise’s arguments about overbreadth and abuse of\n\ndiscretion are valid, and all of the cases Enterprise relies on are factually\n\ndistinguishable. See, e.g., In re Am. Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711 (Tex.\n\n1998) (orig. proceeding) (overbroad requests for every document ever\n\nproduced relating to asbestos, over fifty-year period); Dillard Dep't\n\nStores, Inc., 909 S.W.2d at 492 (overbroad requests for every incident\n\nbetween 1985 and 1990 in 227 stores nationwide); In re Graco Children’\n\ns Prods., Inc., 210 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding)\n\n(overbroad request for 20 categories of documents regarding products and\n\ndefects different from product and defect alleged in suit); Texaco, Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           33\n\f898 S.W.2d at 815 (overbroad requests for documents regarding\n\nsubstances to which plaintiffs never alleged exposure).\n\n         Furthermore, Enterprise has not shown that it lacks an adequate\n\nremedy by appeal. Magellan has shown a reasonable expectation of\n\nobtaining substantial benefit from the compelled discovery. By contrast,\n\nEnterprise has not given this Court any specifics showing that\n\ncompliance will impose a significant burden on Enterprise, much less one\n\n“far out of proportion” to the benefit Magellan may gain.\n\n         B.    NONE OF THE SUBPOENAS ARE OVERBROAD\n\n         Enterprise’s argument about alleged overbreadth of Magellan’s\n\nsubpoenas to the three non-parties mostly just rehashes the same invalid\n\narguments refuted above.\n\n         Magellan’s subpoenas contain the same scope-limiting definitions\n\nused in Magellan’s requests to Enterprise, so the subpoenas only seek\n\ninformation about crude oil and condensate sold at or transported from\n\none of the relevant Origin Points, and only during the period relevant to\n\nthe case.\n\n         The   requested   contracts    with   Enterprise,   and   related\n\ncommunications with Enterprise, are relevant to the issues in the case,\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             34\n\ffor the same reasons discussed above. Each subpoena also requests the\n\nnon-party’s own transactional data, as available, showing what Eagle\n\nFord Product was purchased, sold or delivered under those agreements,\n\non what terms, and how and where the barrels were transported to a final\n\ndestination. That information is relevant to determine whether\n\nEnterprise provided incentives aimed at steering product transportation\n\naround Magellan’s distribution system, and to quantify the extent of\n\nEnterprise’s breach of its commitment to exclusively utilize Magellan’s\n\nfacilities. And obtaining the non-party’s own transactional data is\n\nnecessary, especially since Enterprise claims not to know or be able to\n\ndetermine how or where the barrels were delivered to a final destination\n\nafter Enterprise transported them from an Origin Point to ECHO\n\nTerminal and then sold them back to the non-party.\n\n         Enterprise offers no proof of any significant duplication between the\n\ndocuments the subpoenaed non-party must provide (if available) and\n\nthose Enterprise is compelled to provide (if available). In fact, Enterprise\n\nhas said it does not have all of the relevant contracts with the non-parties\n\nand probably does not have much of the related inter-party\n\ncommunications (MR240, MR371-372, MR376-377), and by definition,\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             35\n\fEnterprise does not have the non-party’s transactional records. In any\n\nevent, the possibility of some duplication, depending on what Enterprise\n\nmay eventually produce, does not render the subpoenas overbroad.\n\n         Neither are the subpoenas overbroad merely because they do not\n\nidentify the non-party custodians whose records may need to be searched.\n\nMagellan has no way to know who the relevant custodians are. The only\n\ncase Enterprise cites as support for its assertion that the subpoenas are\n\n“facially unreasonable and overbroad” for failure to identify custodians\n\nand supply email search terms (Pet., p. 26), does not even address any\n\nsuch issue. See In re Nat’l Lloyds Ins. Co., 507 S.W.3d 219 (Tex. 2016)\n\n(orig. proceeding).\n\n         Moreover, neither Enterprise nor any subpoenaed non-party has\n\nshown that Magellan’s subpoena imposes on the non-party a heavy\n\nburden that far outweighs the benefit to Magellan.\n\nII.      THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY\n         OVERRULING ENTERPRISE’S “TRADE SECRETS” OBJECTION\n\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled\n\nEnterprise’s trade secret objections to Magellan’s discovery requests,\n\nbecause: (1) all discovery the trial court compelled Enterprise to produce\n\nis within the scope of Magellan’s contract audit right because it is\n\n\n{1789105;}                          36\n\freasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent\n\nEnterprise has breached the Distribution Agreement, and thus cannot\n\nconstitute trade secret information Enterprise is privileged to withhold\n\nfrom Magellan; (2) in any event, Enterprise made no prima facie showing\n\nthat any particular information responsive to Magellan’s requests is a\n\ntrade secret; (3) Enterprise waived any trade secret protection as to all\n\ncompelled discovery; and (4) though not required, Magellan established\n\nthat all compelled discovery is material and necessary for a fair\n\nadjudication of Magellan’s claims, including its fraud claim as well as its\n\nbreach of contract claim.\n\n         A.   TO SUPPORT ITS TRADE SECRET OBJECTIONS, ENTERPRISE\n              BORE THE BURDEN TO PROVE THAT THE SPECIFIC\n              INFORMATION SOUGHT BY MAGELLAN QUALIFIES AS TRADE\n              SECRET\n\n         A party who asserts a trade secret privilege as to information\n\nsought in discovery bears the burden to prove that the information is\n\ntrade secret. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 737 (Tex. 2003) (orig.\n\nproceeding); In re Cont’l Gen. Tire, Inc., 979 S.W.2d 609, 612–13 (Tex.\n\n1998) (orig. proceeding). See Tex. R. Evid. 507. Only if and when such\n\nparty establishes the trade secret character of the information does the\n\nburden shift to the requesting party to show that discovery of the\n\n\n{1789105;}                          37\n\finformation is necessary for a fair adjudication of its claims. In re Bass,\n\n113 S.W.3d at 738; In re Cont’l Gen. Tire, Inc., 979 S.W.2d at 610.\n\n         When a party like Enterprise challenges the trial court’s finding\n\nthat information is not a trade secret, the appellate court is “bound by\n\nthe trial court’s finding unless the evidence conclusively establishes, as a\n\nmatter of law, that the information was a trade secret.” Waste Mgmt. of\n\nTexas, Inc. v. Abbott, 406 S.W.3d 626, 631 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2013,\n\npet. denied). And when the evidence is conflicting, an appellate court\n\nmust not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court, and thus may\n\nnot find that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that\n\ninformation is not trade secret. Arrow Chem. Corp. v. Anderson, 386\n\nS.W.2d 309, 313 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1965, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n         B.   ALL COMPELLED DISCOVERY IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF\n              MAGELLAN’S CONTRACT RIGHT TO AUDIT ENTERPRISE, AND\n              THUS CANNOT CONSTITUTE TRADE SECRETS ENTERPRISE IS\n              PRIVILEGED TO WITHHOLD FROM MAGELLAN\n\n         Texas law requires that a trade secret be “secret”, i.e., that it be\n\nneither generally known by others in the same business nor readily\n\nascertainable by “proper means,” such as by contractually-authorized\n\naudit. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 134A.002(4), (6); Zoecon Indus.\n\nv. Am. Stockman Tag Co., 713 F.2d 1174, 1179 (5th Cir. 1983); J.C. Kinley\n\n\n{1789105;}                            38\n\fCo. v. Haynie Wire Line Serv., Inc., 705 S.W.2d 193, 198 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n         Information which a company (Enterprise) grants its competitor\n\n(Magellan) a contract right to review for purposes of auditing compliance\n\nwith the parties’ contract, cannot qualify as trade secret information that\n\nthe first company is privileged to withhold from the other contracting\n\nparty, even though the information may still constitute a trade secret as\n\nto others.10 This principle is clearly illustrated by Millet v. Crump, 687\n\nSo.2d 132 (La. App. 5 Cir. 1996). In that case, the plaintiff sought to\n\nprevent the defendant from reviewing the customer accounts of the\n\ninsurance business the plaintiff had bought from the defendant. In their\n\ncontract, the seller (defendant Crump) agreed that all information\n\npertaining to the customer accounts “is confidential and to be regarded\n\nas Trade Secrets.” Id. at 135. However, the contract also provided that\n\nthe seller “shall have the right to audit all Crump Ins. accounts on a\n\nmonthly basis.” Id. Thus, the court held that since the parties’ contract\n\n\n\n10 See Waste Mgmt. of Texas, Inc. 406 S.W.3d at 635 (holding that although Waste\nManagement provided pricing and volume information to Williamson County under\na contract granting the county the right to access such information for audit purposes,\nWaste Management did not thereby waive trade secret protection as to a third party\nwho sought disclosure via open records request).\n\n\n{1789105;}                                39\n\f“allowed [Crump] access to these files in order to conduct her audit,”\n\n“these files were not treated as confidential or as trade secrets” as\n\nbetween the contracting parties. Id. at 136.11\n\n         In connection with Magellan’s pre-suit audits, Enterprise provided\n\nsome of its Eagle Ford contracts with its customers; some transaction\n\nreports identifying Eagle Ford Product purchase/sale transactions by\n\ndate, customer, location, and volume; and some information regarding\n\nEnterprise’s operations and methods with respect to transportation and\n\ndelivery of Product Enterprise purchases and owns at a specified Eagle\n\nFord Origin Point. Consistent with the law discussed above, Enterprise\n\nhas never claimed that any of the selective information it provided to\n\nMagellan for audit, pursuant to Section 4.4 of the Distribution\n\nAgreement, constitutes a trade secret vis-a-vis Magellan. However,\n\n\n\n\n11 See also Babcock & Wilcox Co. v. Areva NP, Inc., 788 S.E.2d 237, 260 (Va. 2016)\n(holding that there can be no misappropriation of a trade secret where acquisition of\nthe information is expressly authorized by contract, because acquisition by contract\nright constitutes a proper means).\n\n\n{1789105;}                               40\n\fEnterprise asserted a trade secret objection to 20 out of 33 Magellan\n\nrequests. See MR287.12\n\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling\n\nEnterprise’s trade secrets objections, because all 20 of the requests at\n\nissue seek information which, like the limited information Enterprise\n\nprovided during Magellan’s pre-suit audits, is also reasonably necessary\n\nto determine whether and to what extent Enterprise has breached the\n\nDistribution Agreement. The compelled discovery is within the scope of\n\nMagellan’s bargained-for right to audit Enterprise and, therefore, cannot\n\nconstitute trade secret information Enterprise is privileged to withhold.\n\n         This includes requests for documents pertaining to the terms of the\n\ncontracts between Magellan and Enterprise or Enterprise Pipeline\n\n(Request Nos. 1-3); the reasons why Enterprise and its affiliate pursued\n\nthe contracts with Magellan (Request Nos. 4-6); and Enterprise’s plans,\n\n\n12  Enterprise did not assert, in its original responses (MR287) or its amended\nresponses (SR461), a trade secret objection to Request No. 32, the request for\ndocuments Enterprise provided to Magellan in connection with Magellan’s audits.\nThe only other requests to which Enterprise did not object on trade secret grounds\nwere Nos. 7-9 (authorizations to enter into the agreements between Magellan and\nEnterprise or Enterprise Pipeline); No. 11 (inter-party communications about those\nagreements); Nos. 12-16 (Enterprise documents commenting on the meaning or effect\nof, or referring to, the parties’ agreements); Nos. 30-31 (inter-party communications\nand Enterprise internal communications regarding Magellan’s audits; and No. 33\n(documents supporting Enterprise’s credit/offset defense).\n\n\n{1789105;}                               41\n\fgoals, projections, etc. regarding the marketing or transportation of its\n\nEagle Ford Product to its ECHO Terminal, Magellan’s Genoa Junction\n\nconnection, or other Houston area destinations (Request No. 10). The\n\ncontents of those documents reflect circumstances surrounding the\n\nDistribution Agreement, which may properly inform as to the intent and\n\nmeaning of the contract, and thus are pertinent to evaluation of contract\n\ncompliance or breach.\n\n         Magellan’s right to audit also encompasses marketing, buy-sell, and\n\ntransportation agreements pertaining to Eagle Ford Product, between\n\nEnterprise and an affiliate or a customer (e.g., other agreements of the\n\ntype Enterprise previously provided), related communications between\n\nthe contracting parties, and other documents showing which party\n\ninitiated the contract discussions and why (Request Nos. 17-23). All such\n\ninformation is necessary to evaluate whether the agreements were made\n\nfor good faith business reasons, or in a bad faith effort to evade\n\nEnterprise’s obligation to make exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities,\n\nwhich the law forbids. See MR253.\n\n         Information within the scope of Magellan’s audit right also includes\n\nany transactional reports and data available to Enterprise, which permit\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            42\n\fidentification,     quantification,   and   tracing   of   the   ownership,\n\ntransportation, distribution and ultimate delivery of Eagle Ford Product\n\nEnterprise owned or controlled at any designated Origin Point (Request\n\nNos. 24-26, 28-29). Magellan’s need for such information results, in no\n\nsmall part, from the operating methods Enterprise has adopted with\n\nrespect to ownership, transportation and delivery of the Product it owns\n\nat an Origin Point—methods like batching Product at the Origin Point,\n\nselling it back to the producer before it reaches Magellan’s distribution\n\nsystem, not tying or tracking an Origin Point barrel to a barrel sold at an\n\nintermediate location such as ECHO Terminal, and allegedly failing to\n\ntrack further transportation to any final destination including a\n\ndesignated Destination Point.\n\n         In essence, Enterprise is using methods which allow it to claim that\n\nthe Product Enterprise owns at an Origin Point is not covered by the\n\nexclusive-use commitment set forth in the Distribution Agreement\n\nbecause the Product loses its identity and enters a black box once\n\nEnterprise transports it to its ECHO Terminal and resells it to the\n\nproducer. To fully and fairly audit and evaluate contract compliance or\n\nbreach, Magellan is entitled to examine all available documents which\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            43\n\fmay enable it not only to identify and quantify 100% of the Product\n\nvolumes Enterprise owned at an Origin Point, but also to trace how and\n\nwhere all such Product was ultimately delivered. It is preposterous for\n\nEnterprise to contend, as it does, that all Magellan really needs to know\n\nis the volume of Product Enterprise owned at an Origin Point and the\n\nvolume Enterprise transported through Magellan’s distribution system\n\nto a designated Destination Point.\n\n         In sum, none of the information the trial court compelled Enterprise\n\nto produce can qualify as an Enterprise trade secret, at least not as to\n\nMagellan, because all of it falls within the scope of Magellan’s contract\n\naudit right and is not secret at all.\n\n         C.     IN ANY EVENT, ENTERPRISE PRESENTED NO PRIMA FACIE\n                PROOF THAT ANY INFORMATION RESPONSIVE TO\n                MAGELLAN’S DISCOVERY REQUESTS IS TRADE SECRET, AS\n                REQUIRED\n\n         As its “proof” that the information Magellan seeks from Enterprise\n\nand/or        the   subpoenaed   non-parties   is   Enterprise   trade   secret\n\ninformation, Enterprise relies entirely on the Affidavit of Brent Secrest,\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                              44\n\fdated August 10, 2017 (“Secrest Aff.”).13 But that affidavit falls far short\n\nof sufficient proof.\n\n         The Secrest Affidavit is fundamentally flawed not only because it\n\nfails to address the impact of the audit right Enterprise expressly granted\n\nto Magellan, but also because it fails to show that any specific\n\ninformation actually responsive to Magellan’s discovery requests would\n\nqualify as trade secret in the absence of Magellan’s audit right. Although\n\n¶ 10 of the Secrest Affidavit recites the factors relevant to a trade secret\n\ndetermination, none of the factors can be evaluated or applied in a\n\nvacuum, without identification of the specific information in question.\n\nThat is, the specified factors presuppose that the party claiming trade\n\nsecret protection from discovery has identified “the information” actually\n\nat issue. Indeed, Enterprise effectively concedes this burden of proof\n\nwhen it states that “[o]nce Enterprise establishes that the information\n\n\n\n13 Although the Secrest Affidavit is titled “Affidavit of Brent Secrest in Support of\nEnterprise Crude Oil, LLC’s Motion for Protective Order,” is dated the same date\n(August 10, 2017) that Enterprise filed its first motion for protective order/stay of\ndiscovery, and makes assertions in language virtually identical to that motion,\nEnterprise did not submit the affidavit at that time. Enterprise submitted this\naffidavit in support of its October 18, 2017 Amended Motion to Quash (MR160), its\nNovember 28, 2017 Response to Magellan’s Motion to Compel (MR390), and its\nNovember 28, 2017 Motion for Entry of a Protective Order Governing the Production\nof Confidential Information (MR474).\n\n\n{1789105;}                               45\n\fMagellan is demanding is trade secret, such information cannot be\n\nproduced until Magellan establishes that such information is necessary\n\nfor a fair trial.” Pet., p. 27-28 (emphasis added). But Enterprise made no\n\nsuch showing. This is why Enterprise’s argument—that the Secrest\n\nAffidavit proves its trade secret claim—finds no support in the lone case\n\nEnterprise cites on this point, In re Union Pac. R.R. Co., 294 S.W.3d 589,\n\n592 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam).14\n\n         Instead of identifying any specific information sought by Magellan,\n\nand presenting evidence detailing the reasons why that information is\n\ntrade secret, Enterprise has taken a fundamentally different (and fatally\n\n\n\n14In re Union Pac. R. R. Co. was a train wreck case where the plaintiff claimed injury\nfrom inhaling chlorine gas released when Union Pacific’s train failed to stop at a\nsignal, collided with another train, and derailed, releasing toxic chlorine gas. The\nplaintiff alleged that the railroad should have positioned the chlorine car farther\ntoward the rear of the train. In discovery, the plaintiff sought disclosure of three years\nof specific rates Union Pacific charged for handling the shipping customer’s chlorine\nchemicals as compared to the rates it charged for handling non-hazardous materials.\nThe Supreme Court noted that a trial court must first determine “whether the\nrequested production constitutes a trade secret,” and that the issue for decision was\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion by ordering Union Pacific to produce\n“confidential ‘rate structures’ which include formulas to determine shipping rates\ncharged to customers.” 294 S.W.2d at 590, 591 (emphasis added). Unlike Enterprise,\nUnion Pacific provided two affidavits specifically “explaining why this rate\ninformation” constituted a trade secret. Id. at 592. For that reason, and because the\nplaintiff did not dispute that the requested rate structures were trade secrets, the\nSupreme Court concluded that Union Pacific had established its trade secrets claim.\nId. On its facts and its face, In re Union Pac. R. R. Co. does not support Enterprise’s\nargument that “parties with as (or less) detailed affidavits have obtained relief to\nprotect their trade secrets.” Pet., p. 32.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                 46\n\fflawed) approach in its quest to block discovery on trade secret grounds.\n\nFirst, before the trial court, and even here, Enterprise makes sweeping\n\nassertions to the effect that virtually all of its business information is\n\ntrade secret, except to the extent Enterprise decided to disclose it in\n\nMagellan’s audits.15 Second, Enterprise falsely claims that Magellan’s\n\ndiscovery requests to Enterprise and the subpoenaed non-parties must\n\ninvade Enterprise’s trade secret information because they encompass\n\nvirtually    all   such    confidential     business      information—e.g.,       that\n\nMagellan’s requests seek “detailed information about the entirety of\n\nEnterprise’s crude oil business in Eagle Ford and South Texas” (MR478,\n\nemphasis added), its “business plans, proposals, goals, projections,\n\nbudgets, estimates, statistics, and histories for its entire Gulf Coast\n\noperations” (Pet., p. 9, emphasis added), “Enterprise’s full playbook of\n\ntrade secrets for the Gulf Coast region” (Pet., p. 16, emphasis added); and\n\n“nearly every document concerning Enterprise’s Gulf Coast operations”\n\n(Pet., p. 29, emphasis added). Third, bootstrapping on such false claims,\n\n\n\n\n15For example, in its Petition Enterprise asserts that all of its “confidential business\ninformation” constitutes “Enterprise’s trade secrets ... which Enterprise has spent\nmany years developing... .” Pet., p. 13. This can also be seen in Enterprise’s trade\nsecret objection to the great majority of Magellan’s requests.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                47\n\fEnterprise asserts that the Secrest Affidavit proved that “the breadth of\n\nMagellan’s requests and customer subpoenas necessarily seek discovery\n\nof Enterprise’s trade secrets.” Pet., pp. 28-30. In reality, the Secrest\n\nAffidavit contains four short paragraphs that merely parrot Enterprise’s\n\ngross mischaracterizations of the scope of Magellan’s requests, never\n\nspecifically identifying a single request, much less explaining how the\n\ninformation actually sought by that request is trade secret. MR407.16\n\n         This explains why Enterprise’s fallback argument is that all the\n\ninformation it seeks to withhold qualifies as trade secret in combination\n\nor compilation. See Pet., p. 29. However, that argument fails for the same\n\nreasons discussed above. See Brigham Young Univ. v. Pfizer, Inc., 861\n\nF.Supp.2d 1320, 1323–24 (D. Utah 2012) (to prove trade secret by\n\ncompilation of elements, “[s]imply pointing to a large amount of\n\ninformation and claiming it is secret will not do”); VFD Consulting, Inc.\n\nv. 21st Servs., 425 F.Supp.2d 1037, 1049 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (denying a\n\n\n\n16 The closest Enterprise ever comes to identifying a particular request claimed to\ninvade its trade secrets is when it says the trial court compelled production of trade\nsecret documents “such as those responsive to Request for Production No. 10.” Pet.,\np. 31. But the Secrest Affidavit never identifies any specific Enterprise documents\nwhich are actually responsive to that scope-limited request. See discussion above.\nFurthermore, any such responsive documents that may exist are within the scope of\nMagellan’s audit right and, therefore, cannot be “trade secret” as to Magellan.\n\n\n{1789105;}                               48\n\fcompilation trade secret claim because plaintiff had failed to show “with\n\nany particularity, how [plaintiff] organized or combined the materials in\n\na manner that rises to the level of a legally protectable trade secret”);\n\nJostens, Inc. v.

Simply to assert a trade secret\n\nresides in some combination of otherwise known data is not sufficient, as\n\nthe combination itself must be delineated with some particularity in\n\nestablishing its trade secret status.”)\n\n         The problem with all of that—aside from the fact that Enterprise\n\nhas made contradictory representations to the trial court and this\n\nCourt17—is that Enterprise’s mischaracterization of the breadth of\n\nMagellan’s discovery requests is far beyond mere hyperbole; in fact, it is\n\npatently false. As shown in the preceding section of Magellan’s argument,\n\nMagellan’s discovery requests are nowhere near that broad but are, in\n\n\n\n17Here, Enterprise represents that “[t]he trial court compelled Enterprise to respond\nto requests that would encompass volumes of proven trade secrets.” Pet., p. 27\n(emphasis added). But in the trial court, to support its request to hamstring Magellan\nwith a protective order allowing Enterprise to designate all of its “trade secret”\ninformation for “Outside Attorney’s Eyes Only,” Enterprise represented that its trade\nsecret documents comprise only a “select group of highly sensitive information.”\nMR474 (emphasis added), SR403.\n\n\n{1789105;}                               49\n\ffact, carefully tailored and reasonably limited in scope to information\n\ndirectly relevant to Magellan’s claims and damages.\n\n         D.   ENTERPRISE WAIVED ANY POTENTIAL TRADE SECRET\n              PRIVILEGE AS TO MAGELLAN\n\n         To reiterate, during Magellan’s audits Enterprise never claimed\n\nthat any of the information it disclosed was trade secret, nor did it assert\n\na trade secret objection to Magellan’s subsequent discovery request for\n\nthe same information. Yet when it has suited Enterprise, Enterprise has\n\nimplied that the data it provided for audit is (or was) trade secret:\n\n“disclosure of some trade-secret information subject to a confidentiality\n\nagreement does not mean that Magellan is entitled to disclosure of all\n\nsuch information.” MR397 (italics original). But in fact, it does mean that.\n\n         Texas Rule of Evidence 511(a) provides that “[a] person upon whom\n\nthese rules confer a privilege against disclosure waives the privilege if …\n\nthe person … voluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any\n\nsignificant part of the privileged matter unless such disclosure itself is\n\nprivileged.” Tex. R. Evid. 511(a). In other words, “a privilege may not be\n\nwaived selectively to disclose only such evidence as may be beneficial to\n\nthe party holding the privilege.” Bailey v. State, 469 S.W.3d 762, 774\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015)). See 1 McCormick on Evidence §\n\n\n{1789105;}                           50\n\f93 (7th ed. 2013) (“Waiver may be found ... from conduct such as partial\n\ndisclosure which would make it unfair for the client to invoke the\n\nprivilege thereafter.”).\n\n         There is no doubt that the information Enterprise provided for\n\naudit was a significant (albeit incomplete) part of the universe of\n\ncompelled discovery Enterprise claims is trade secret, and that the prior\n\ndisclosure, pursuant to Section 4.4 of the Distribution Agreement, was\n\nnot itself privileged as to Magellan. Enterprise cannot have it both ways.\n\nIf the data disclosed during audit was not trade secret vis-a-vis the\n\ncontracting party holding a voluntarily granted contract right to audit,\n\nthen neither is the data Enterprise was ordered to produce. On the other\n\nhand, if Enterprise disclosed trade secret information, then it waived any\n\npotential trade secret privilege as to the rest of the information the trial\n\ncourt compelled Enterprise to produce.\n\n         E.   THOUGH NOT REQUIRED, MAGELLAN SHOWED                        A\n              REASONABLE NECESSITY FOR THE DISCOVERY\n\n         When the party asserting trade secret protection meets its burden\n\nof proof, which Enterprise failed to do, the requesting party’s burden is\n\nmerely to show a “reasonable necessity” for the information, which\n\n“depends on whether the trade secret’s production is material and\n\n\n{1789105;}                           51\n\fnecessary to the litigation.” In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d at 738, 743 (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted). “We have not stated conclusively\n\nwhat would or would not be considered necessary for a fair adjudication,\n\nindicating instead that the application of the test would depend on the\n\ncircumstances presented. The degree to which information is necessary\n\nin a case depends on the nature of the information and the context of the\n\ncase.” In re Union Pac. R. R. Co., 294 S.W.3d at 592 (per curiam) (citation\n\nomitted) (alterations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).18\n\n         Though it was not required, Magellan showed reasonable necessity\n\nthrough testimony of its lead auditor, who explained that to fully and\n\nfairly verify the extent of Enterprise’s breach of its commitment to make\n\nexclusive use of Magellan’s facilities—especially in light of the black box\n\noperating methods Enterprise revealed in audits—Magellan needs to\n\n\n18 In In re Union Pac. R. R. Co., the Court found a failure to show reasonable\nnecessity, but the case is clearly distinguishable on its facts. There, the plaintiff\nclaimed she needed discovery of certain Union Pacific rate structures, to rebut the\nrailroad’s claim that placing hazmat rail cars in the back of the train would be cost-\nprohibitive, and to argue that higher rates for hazardous materials handling were an\nacknowledgment of a greater duty to take precautions. But two considerations led the\nCourt to conclude that the plaintiff had failed to show reasonable necessity. First,\nUnion Pacific admitted that it was financially able to reposition the railcars, so\ndiscovery of specific rates was unnecessary to rebut the railroad’s “cost-prohibitive”\nargument. Second, Union Pacific admitted that it charged higher rates to ship\nhazardous materials versus non-hazardous materials. Therefore, said the Court, “it\nis unclear to us, and [plaintiff] has not explained, why she needs the specific rate\nstructures to advance this negligence theory.” Id. at 593 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n{1789105;}                               52\n\fdiscover information Enterprise refused to provide for audit, including\n\ninformation showing where all of the Eagle Ford Product Enterprise\n\nowned at an Origin Point was ultimately delivered, how it was\n\ntransported to those destinations, and why Enterprise did not utilize\n\nMagellan’s facilities. MR322-327.\n\n         In addition, Magellan showed that the other information\n\nEnterprise was compelled to produce is material and necessary (1) to\n\ndebunk the contract interpretation Enterprise asserts and has previously\n\nused as an excuse to refuse Magellan’s requests for the all of the\n\ntransactional data needed for a full and fair audit, (2) to corroborate that\n\nEnterprise deceived Magellan when it represented that Enterprise\n\nwanted and needed to utilize Magellan’s facilities (as opposed to the ones\n\nEnterprise owned or was planning to develop), and when it represented\n\nthat Enterprise intended to make exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities\n\nfor delivery all of Enterprise’s marketing volumes of Eagle Ford Product\n\nfrom an Origin Point to a Destination Point (without revealing any\n\nEnterprise plans to circumvent that use in the ways Enterprise is now\n\nknown to have done); (3) to corroborate that Enterprise never intended\n\nto perform the 10-year exclusive use commitment it made to induce\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          53\n\fMagellan’s expenditure of tens of millions of dollars on expansion and\n\nimprovement of its distribution facilities; and (4) to corroborate that\n\nEnterprise’s complete failure to utilize Magellan’s facilities is due not to\n\ngood faith business reasons but to bad faith efforts to evade Enterprise’s\n\ntransportation commitment to its competitor, Magellan. And none of that\n\nmaterial information is available from another source.19\n\n         Due to extensive motion practice, briefing, and arguments on the\n\nmerits of the case as well as the discovery issues, the trial court is steeped\n\nin the context of the case and the nature of the information material and\n\nnecessary to the litigation. Thus, the trial court was in the best position\n\nto weigh the conflicting evidence and determine whether Enterprise\n\nsufficiently proved any valid trade secret privilege—including whether,\n\nunder Tex. R. Evid. 507(a), no such privilege exists because “non-\n\ndisclosure will tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work injustice”)—and\n\neven if so, whether Magellan also showed reasonable necessity for the\n\ndiscovery. And there is simply nothing to support Enterprise’s argument\n\n\n\n\n19Cf. In re Rockafellow, 2013 WL 1836451, at *10 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Apr. 30, 2013)\n(orig. proceeding) (balancing claimed need for defendant’s customer list against\npotential harm of disclosure, and finding inadequate showing of need where evidence\nindicated requester could obtain the information from other sources).\n\n\n{1789105;}                              54\n\fthat the trial court abused its discretion when it overruled Enterprise’s\n\ntrade secret objections and compelled production.\n\n         F.   THE PROTECTIVE ORDER FULLY PROTECTS ANY\n              INFORMATION THAT MAY BE TRADE SECRET AND IS NOT AN\n              ABUSE OF DISCRETION\n\n         Nothing in Enterprise’s Amended Petition supports its argument\n\nthat the trial court’s approval of the Protective Order (SR534-543)\n\namounts to a clear abuse of discretion warranting mandamus relief. The\n\nProtective Order strikes an appropriate balance between the parties’\n\ncompeting interests in discovery of any trade secret information,\n\nproviding more than adequate protection for any real trade secret\n\ninformation that Enterprise, Magellan, or any non-party may produce.\n\n         Enterprise’s objections to the Protective Order concern its\n\nrestrictions on review of Enterprise-produced “Attorneys Eyes Only”\n\n(“AEO”) information by Magellan’s in-house counsel, or by Enterprise’s\n\nown current or former employees, and the purported risk associated with\n\nsuch review. None of those objections have merit.\n\n         The Protective Order strictly limits access to any confidential or\n\ntrade secret information. As Enterprise requested, the trial court ordered\n\ntwo-tiered protection allowing any producing party or non-party to\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            55\n\fdesignate any “Classified Information” as either “Confidential” or AEO.\n\nSR534-535. The only Magellan representatives authorized to see any\n\nAEO information produced by Enterprise or a non-party are: (1)\n\nMagellan’s outside counsel in this case; (2) Magellan in-house counsel\n\nwho (a) manage litigation, (b) are actively involved in assisting\n\nMagellan’s outside counsel in this action, and (c) do not make or\n\nparticipate in competitive business decisions; (3) Magellan auditors who\n\n(a) are actively involved in assisting Magellan’s outside counsel in this\n\naction, and (b) do not make or participate in competitive business\n\ndecisions; and (4) independent experts or consultants. Id. Before they can\n\nsee any AEO information, any qualified in-house counsel, auditors, and\n\nexperts/consultants must also sign a document agreeing to be bound by\n\nthe Protective Order, which also provides that recipient’s use of AEO or\n\nany other “Classified Information” produced by another party or non-\n\nparty must be “solely for” this litigation and “for no other purpose.”\n\nSR538. Thus, the Protective Order is far more restrictive than the\n\nparties’ audit-related confidentiality agreement which, as noted above,\n\nallowed the same kinds of information to be reviewed by any Magellan\n\nrepresentative with a “legitimate need.” MR468.\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                         56\n\f         It is true that for eligible in-house counsel who may review another\n\nparty’s AEO information, the Protective Order does not disqualify them\n\nfrom participating in business decisions for a specified period after this\n\nlitigation is concluded. See Pet., p. 39. However, Enterprise conveniently\n\nfails to mention that it never sought such a limitation on in-house\n\ncounsel. To the contrary, in fact, Enterprise forcefully advocated against\n\nit. MR837. Enterprise is in no position to reverse course and claim, before\n\nthis Court, that the trial court abused its discretion by “failing” to require\n\nthat in-house counsel avoid participation in any business decisions for a\n\nspecified time following this litigation.\n\n         In any event, Enterprise provides no support for its argument that\n\naccess by Magellan’s in-house litigation counsel carries a significant risk\n\nthat Magellan will inadvertently disclose or deliberately misuse AEO\n\ninformation, in violation of the Protective Order. Brent Secrest’s latest\n\naffidavit, dated December 21, 2017, contains certain general assertions\n\nabout “flat” organizational structures and associated risks that\n\ninformation learned by an in-house attorney will be disclosed or used in\n\nviolation of a court’s protective order. See MR728-729. As it relates to\n\nMagellan, however, Mr. Secrest’s assertions and conclusions are sheer\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            57\n\fspeculation; he does not even claim to have any personal knowledge\n\nabout Magellan’s in-house litigation counsel or Magellan’s internal\n\nstructures and processes. Id. Mr. Secrest’s affidavit also mischaracterizes\n\nthe pending proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory\n\nCommission (“FERC”), and speculates that information Magellan’s in-\n\nhouse counsel learn through discovery in this unrelated case will\n\ninevitably “bleed over” into the FERC proceeding. MR729. That\n\nassertion, which impugns the integrity and professional ethics of\n\nMagellan’s in-house counsel, is baseless and false.\n\n         Equally specious is Enterprise’s claim that the Protective Order\n\nlacks adequate protection with respect to Enterprise-produced AEO\n\ninformation that may be shown to Enterprise’s own current or former\n\nemployees. See Pet., pp. 39-40. The Protective Order permits AEO\n\ninformation to be disclosed only to certain of Enterprise’s current or\n\nformer employees, and only under certain conditions. Specifically, under\n\nparagraph 2(a)(iv), only those current or former Enterprise employees\n\nwho are “reasonably believed to have knowledge or information relevant\n\nto the litigation” may see Enterprise-produced AEO information; for\n\nformer employees, the person must have been employed by Enterprise\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           58\n\fwhen the information was generated; and all current and former\n\nemployees must sign a document agreeing to be bound by the Protective\n\nOrder. SR535.\n\n         In all probability, the only Enterprise employees who have relevant\n\nknowledge, and thus will be eligible to see Enterprise-produced AEO\n\ninformation, are or were senior executives or managerial-level personnel\n\nin Enterprise’s crude oil marketing business. By Enterprise’s admission,\n\nall of those people have or had access to the kinds of business information\n\nEnterprise is compelled to produce pursuant to Magellan’s requests. In\n\nhis affidavit dated August 10, 2017, Brent Secrest testified that “[n]o one\n\noutside of Enterprise’s senior executives and the crude marketing\n\ngroup have access to comprehensive business and strategic information”\n\nof the type Magellan seeks to discover. MR178 (emphasis added).\n\nTellingly, none of Mr. Secrest’s affidavits identify a single current or\n\nformer employee who is knowledgeable about the case and is someone\n\nwho does not or did not have access to Enterprise’s “comprehensive\n\nbusiness and strategic information.” In other words, all of Enterprise’s\n\nassertions about its internal compartmentalization of sensitive business\n\ninformation are misleading diversions. Enterprise has never asserted\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            59\n\f(much less proved) that any sensitive business information sought by\n\nMagellan is or ever was off-limits to any current or former employee who\n\nmay be a witness in this case.\n\n         Enterprise also mischaracterizes the competing interests that must\n\nbe appropriately balanced in a protective order. First, Enterprise\n\nunderstates Magellan’s interest in discovery of Enterprise’s business\n\nplans, methods and practices regarding marketing and delivery of\n\nProduct Enterprise purchases and moves from an Eagle Ford Origin\n\nPoint. Magellan’s interest is not merely a “highly generalized” (Pet., p.\n\n39) interest in prosecuting its claims. Rather, for all the reasons\n\ndiscussed above, the discovery at issue goes to the heart of Magellan’s\n\nclaims for breach of contract and fraud, and quantification of damages\n\ndespite      Enterprise’s   attempts   to   camouflage   relevant   Product\n\nmovements to the point they become untraceable and unauditable.\n\n         Second, Enterprise greatly overstates any “competitive harm” it\n\ncould conceivably suffer in the highly unlikely event any of the few\n\nMagellan attorneys or Enterprise employees who may review its so-called\n\n“trade secret” information—none of which is actually trade secret vis-a-\n\nvis Magellan—were to use or disclose it in direct violation of the\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             60\n\fProtective Order they will have committed (in writing) to follow. The\n\ntruth is that before this suit was filed, Enterprise provided to Magellan,\n\nwithout the strict protections contained in the Protective Order, much of\n\nwhat Enterprise now claims to be trade secret information regarding its\n\ncrude oil marketing and transportation agreements, methods and\n\npractices. See SR493-511. In addition, Enterprise’s public filings in this\n\naction describe those agreements, methods and practices in substantial\n\ndetail. See MR082-158. Given all of the allegedly confidential information\n\nEnterprise has publicly disclosed, or provided for review by any Magellan\n\nemployee with a “legitimate need,” its claims about the “competitive\n\nharm” that could result from unauthorized use or disclosure of any other\n\ninformation Enterprise must produce—which, of course, the Protective\n\nOrder strictly prohibits—is not credible and provides no basis to conclude\n\nthat the trial court committed an abuse of discretion.\n\n         Finally, none of the cases Enterprise cites support its position that\n\nthe Protective Order constitutes a clear abuse of the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion in light of the facts of this case and the competing interests to\n\nbe balanced. Every case Enterprise relies on turned on its own peculiar\n\nfacts, and involved discovery of highly sensitive if not ultra-sensitive\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             61\n\finformation where the potential harm was different in kind and more\n\nserious in nature than any present here, and where the risk of improper\n\ndisclosure was not purely speculative (as it is here).20 Enterprise’s cases\n\ndo not, either individually or collectively, establish any immutable rule\n\nthat a protective order must include any protections more stringent than\n\nthose contained in the Protective Order the trial court entered in this\n\ncase.\n\n         Indeed, many courts have approved protective orders containing\n\nthe same or lesser protections than those found in this Protective Order.\n\nSee, e.g., Life Techs. Corp. v. Biosearch Techs., Inc., 2011 WL 1157860 at\n\n*2-3 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 29, 2011) (permitting two of plaintiff’s in-house\n\ncounsel to review materials designated “highly confidential—outside\n\ncounsel’s eyes only, noting that denying such access would impair the\n\nplaintiff’s ability to prosecute its claims); U.S. Steel Corp. v. United\n\nStates, 730 F.2d 1465, 1469 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (permitting review by in-\n\nhouse counsel despite the possibility in-house counsel might move into\n\n\n20 Several of the cases Enterprise cites (Pet., pp. 35-38) are intellectual property cases\ninvolving ultra-sensitive information, or employment-related cases where Texas\ncourts have understandably enjoined or placed strict limits on an employee’s use or\ndisclosure of trade secrets obtained from a former employer. Again, Enterprise has\nacknowledged that none of the “trade secret” information it is compelled to produce\nis “ultra-sensitive.” MR538.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                 62\n\fother positions); Safe Flight Instrument Corp. v.

THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR, OR ABUSE ITS DISCRETION, BY\n     COMPELLING DISCOVERY OF ANY INFORMATION ENTERPRISE\n     LABELS AS “PAROL EVIDENCE”\n\n         Enterprise’s “parol evidence” assault on the trial court’s order\n\ncompelling production responsive to Magellan Request Nos. 1-6 and 12-\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           63\n\f16 hinges entirely on its argument that the Distribution Agreement is\n\n“facially unambiguous.” Pet., p. 41. This is the very same argument,\n\npractically verbatim, that Enterprise made in its unsuccessful motion for\n\nsummary judgment. See MR082-158.\n\n         In that motion, Enterprise argued that there is only one reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the 10-year commitment it made in the Distribution\n\nAgreement—that Enterprise is obligated to make exclusive use of\n\nMagellan’s distribution facilities only if Enterprise chooses to retain\n\nownership of its Eagle Ford crude oil at all times and places along its\n\ntransport from an Origin Point to a Destination Point and Enterprise also\n\nchooses to deliver the crude to Magellan’s Connection Point on its\n\nway to a Destination Point. See MR082. But as Magellan explained to the\n\ntrial court in its opposition to Enterprise’s summary judgment motion,\n\nEnterprise’s interpretation renders illusory the commitment it made for\n\nthe express purpose of inducing Magellan to invest heavily in expansion\n\nand improvement of its distribution system, is inconsistent with the\n\noverall purpose of the contract, and certainly is not the only reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the contract language when read in context and as a\n\nwhole. See SR073.\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            64\n\f         Although the trial court denied Enterprise’s summary judgment\n\nmotion following extensive briefing and oral argument (MR159), nothing\n\nin the record supports Enterprise’s assertion (Pet., p. 42) that the trial\n\ncourt has finally determined whether the Distribution Agreement is or is\n\nnot ambiguous as it relates to Enterprise’s commitment. What is clear is\n\nthat the trial court rejected Enterprise’s argument that the only\n\nreasonable interpretation of the Distribution Agreement, on its face, is\n\nthe one Enterprise advocates.\n\n         Given the applicable rules of contract construction, it is clearly\n\nwithin a trial court’s discretion to permit discovery into the facts and\n\ncircumstances surrounding a contract before the court decides whether\n\nthe contract is ambiguous, or what it must or may mean. A court must\n\nconstrue a written agreement in light of all the surrounding facts and\n\ncircumstances. See First Bank v. Brumitt, 519 S.W. 3d 95, 109-10 (Tex.\n\n2017); Banker v. Breaux, 133 Tex. 183, 128 S.W.2d 23, 24 (1939) (stating\n\nthat the contracting parties’ intention, which is of controlling importance,\n\nmust be ascertained from their agreement “in the light of the attending\n\ncircumstances”). This includes consideration of “the undisputed evidence\n\nregarding [the contract’s] negotiation and purpose.” Basic Capital Mgmt.,\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            65\n\fInd. v. Dynex Commercial, Inc., 348 S.W.3d 894, 901 (Tex. 2011). Indeed,\n\neven when a court concludes that the contract is unambiguous, it may\n\nstill consider the surrounding facts and circumstances to “aid in the\n\nconstruction of the contract’s language.” Sun Oil Co. (Del.) v. Madeley,\n\n626 S.W.2d 726, 731 (Tex. 1981). “In other words, the parol-evidence rule\n\ndoes not prohibit consideration of surrounding circumstances that\n\ninform, rather than vary from or contradict, the contract text.” First\n\nBank, 519 S.W.3d at 110 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n         Despite this settled law, Enterprise is on a mission to put the cart\n\nbefore the horse, to force the trial court to construe the Distribution\n\nAgreement in Enterprise’s favor without knowing the surrounding facts\n\nand circumstances and without their benefit as an aid in construction of\n\nthe contract language, at the very least. Enterprise’s attack on this aspect\n\nof the trial court’s discovery order must be seen for what it is: a thinly-\n\ndisguised and improper request for mandamus relief from the trial\n\ncourt’s denial of Enterprise’s unmeritorious summary judgment motion.\n\n“Mandamus is generally unavailable when a trial court denies summary\n\njudgment, no matter how meritorious the motion.” In re Ooida Risk\n\nRetention Grp., Inc., 475 S.W.3d 905, 913 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2015)\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            66\n\f(orig. proceeding) (denying mandamus relief on denial of motion for\n\nsummary judgment); In re McAllen Med. Ctr., Inc., 275 S.W.3d 458, 465\n\n(Tex. 2008) (orig. proceeding) (noting that “parties are not ‘entitled’ to\n\nsummary judgment” and therefore mandamus is generally unavailable).\n\nOnly “extraordinary circumstances will justify mandamus review of\n\norders denying summary judgment,” and even “[t]he fact that there could\n\npotentially be a waste in time and money in proceeding to trial without\n\ncorrection of the alleged error” is insufficient to warrant mandamus\n\nrelief. In re State Farm Lloyds, 2016 WL 902864, at *3 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi Mar. 9, 2016) (orig. proceeding).\n\n         Moreover, despite what Enterprise contends, this is not a case like\n\nIn re Islamadora Fish Co. Texas, L.L.C., 319 S.W.3d 908 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2010) (orig. proceeding), where after denying summary judgment\n\nthe trial court ordered discovery that was not relevant under any theory\n\nasserted in the case. Id. at 912 (finding that by statute, punitive damages\n\nwere not recoverable in the case, and concluding that “when punitive\n\ndamages clearly are not recoverable, information about net worth is not\n\nrelevant and, as a result, not discoverable”).\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            67\n\f         The information Enterprise claims is wholly undiscoverable “parol\n\nevidence” concerns the representations Enterprise made about why it\n\nwas interested in pursuing a contract committing it to exclusively use a\n\ncompetitor’s facilities for ten years, what its actual plans and intentions\n\nwere in respect of that commitment, and other facts and circumstances\n\nsurrounding the Distribution Agreement. This includes: (1) drafts of the\n\nDistribution Agreement and related agreements, and internal or party-\n\nto-party communications about the agreements (Request Nos. 1-3), and\n\n(2) other documents referencing the agreements, such as ones discussing\n\nEnterprise’s motivation for entering into the agreements or its view of\n\nwhat the agreements required of Enterprise (Request Nos. 4-6 and 12-\n\n16).\n\n         While such information is relevant to Magellan’s breach of contract\n\nclaim, it is also relevant and discoverable as to other alleged claims. Take\n\nthe fraud claim. Enterprise argues that the Distribution Agreement’s\n\nmerger clause bars discovery of anything and everything Enterprise\n\nlabels as “parol evidence.” But it does not. “A merger clause can be\n\ndisregarded upon pleading and proof of ambiguity, fraud, or accident.”\n\nISG State Operations, Inc. v. Nat’l Heritage Ins. Co., 234 S.W.3d 711,\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            68\n\f719–20 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2007, pet. denied) (emphasis added); see\n\nalso Probado Techs. Corp. v. Smartnet, Inc., No. CIV.A. C-09-349, 2010\n\nWL 2232831, at *6 (S.D. Tex. June 2, 2010) (“A court may disregard an\n\nintegration clause and look to prior agreements if there is evidence of\n\nambiguity, fraud, or accident in the written contract.”). Here, too,\n\nEnterprise stands the law on its head by arguing that the merger clause\n\nbars discovery of the very evidence showing why the merger clause\n\nshould be disregarded.\n\n         Or consider Magellan’s promissory estoppel claim, another claim on\n\nwhich Enterprise sought summary judgment but lost. If, as Enterprise\n\ncontends (but Magellan disputes), the Distribution Agreement does not\n\nembody the promise Magellan alleges Enterprise actually made\n\nregarding exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities, Magellan has a claim for\n\npromissory estoppel. See Trevino & Assocs. Mech., L.P. v. Frost Nat’l.\n\nBank, 400 S.W.3d 139, 146 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.) (“promissory\n\nestoppel will apply to a promise outside a contract”). Information\n\ncorroborating the promise Enterprise made, which may well be found in\n\ndocuments responsive to these requests, is also relevant to the\n\npromissory fraud claim.\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            69\n\f         None of the cases Enterprise cites support the argument that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by compelling production responsive to\n\nthese requests. For example, Enterprise’s heavy reliance on Nat’l Union\n\nFire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517 (Tex.\n\n1995) is misplaced. The court in CBI Indus. specifically held that\n\n“[e]xtrinsic evidence may, indeed, be admissible to give the words of a\n\ncontract a meaning consistent with that to which they are reasonably\n\nsusceptible, i.e., to ‘interpret’ contractual terms.” Id. at 521. Based on the\n\nunique facts of that case, the trial court simply concluded that the record\n\nwas sufficiently developed to warrant summary judgment, and the\n\nappellate court affirmed. Id. at 522. See Ford Motor Co., 279 S.W.3d at\n\n664 (Tex. 2009) (noting that discovery was unnecessary in CBI Industries\n\nbecause “the facts in [that case] were sufficiently developed and all the\n\nrelevant information was at hand” (alterations omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)). Here, though, the trial court was within its\n\ndiscretion to find the contrary and permit discovery to proceed.\n\n         None of the other cases Enterprise relies on were decided in a\n\ndiscovery context, and all of them involved actual consideration of\n\nevidence similar to what Magellan seeks to discover. See Lake v. Cravens,\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           70\n\f488 S.W.3d 867, 896 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2016, no pet.) (reviewing a\n\njury verdict, discussing evidence of agreements exchanged before\n\nexecution of the contract at issue); Miller Glob. Props., LLC v. Marriott\n\nInt’l, Inc., 418 S.W.3d 342, 348-49 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, pet. denied)\n\n(reviewing summary judgment, discussing evidence of pre-contract\n\ncommunications and representations by defendant); DRC Parts &\n\nAccessories, L.L.C. v. VM Motori, S.P.A., 112 S.W.3d 854, 858-59 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied) (considering evidence in\n\nthe context of summary judgment review); C & A Invs., Inc. v. Bonnet\n\nRes. Corp., 959 S.W.2d 258, 260 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1997, writ denied)\n\n(considering pre-closing communications between the parties, in the\n\ncontext of summary judgment review).\n\n         Finally, but importantly, Enterprise has not shown, as it must for\n\nmandamus relief, that discovery of the information it characterizes as\n\nparol evidence will burden Enterprise far out of proportion to the benefit\n\nMagellan may gain. See Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 843.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            71\n\f                             CONCLUSION\n\n         For the reasons stated above, the Amended Petition for Writ of\n\nMandamus should be denied. Based on the Amended Petition and this\n\nResponse, Magellan does not believe that oral argument is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          72\n\f DATED: January 30, 2018   Respectfully submitted,\n\n                           GABLEGOTWALS\n\n                           s/David L.

This motion is brought pursuant to Rule 192.6 of the Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, and to give effect to Rule 1 which provides that the objective of the rules is to\n\nobtain a just, fair, equitable and impartial adjudication of the rights of the parties with as great\n\nexpedition and dispatch and the least expense to the parties.\n\n                             I.     SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       This Court should issue an Order staying discovery pending resolution of the threshold\n\nlegal issues raised in Enterprise’s Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment filed on August 4,\n\n2017. Enterprise’s summary judgment motion argues that the plain and unambiguous language\n\nof the parties’ agreement precludes all of Magellan’s claims a matter of law. Because the Court\n\nneed not and indeed cannot consider any extraneous evidence in determining the threshold legal\n\nissue raised in Enterprise’s motion for summary judgment, discovery at this juncture is\n\nunnecessary, premature and would only serve to increase the burden and expense of litigation.\n\n\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

Indeed, the sensitive business information Magellan seeks from both Enterprise in its\n\nRequests for Production and from Enterprise’s customers in Magellan’s third-party subpoenas\n\nshow that Magellan’s discovery requests are not meant to discover relevant facts, but rather to\n\nharass and impose undue burdens on Enterprise and its customers in an attempt to improve\n\nMagellan’s bargaining position in the case. The Court should therefore enter an order protecting\n\nEnterprise from having to respond to Magellan’s requests and quash the non-party subpoenas.\n\n                         II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n           Enterprise and Magellan are parties to a Crude Oil Distribution Agreement1 that provides\n\nas follows:\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The Distribution Agreement is Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s Original Petition.\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

Consistent with the plain language of the Distribution\n\nAgreement, Enterprise has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building its own crude oil\n\ndistribution assets.\n\n        Beginning in 2015, Magellan commenced a series of audits seeking to force Enterprise to\n\ndivulge its customer information and other data unnecessary to confirm payment of the agreed\n\ntariffs for crude meeting the criteria set out in the Distribution Agreement. Magellan’s rights to\n\naudit under the Distribution Agreement are limited to documents necessary to determine whether\n\nbarrels subject to the agreement have been treated properly. Thus, the only information\n\nEnterprise was required to provide Magellan was documentation sufficient to show the\n\ndisposition of crude that came from an Origin Point up to the time when it ceased to be Owned\n\nor Controlled by Enterprise. As to any crude that Enterprise Owned or Controlled from Origin\n\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

As\n\nthe audit progressed, it became apparent that although the Distribution Agreement specified\n\nprecise criteria for what crude was subject to the Distribution Agreement, Magellan’s position\n\nwas that the criteria set out in Section 4.1 should be disregarded in favor of a supposed “intent”\n\nexpressed nowhere within the four corners of the contract. To that end, Magellan demanded that\n\nEnterprise provide every contract or title transfer document for all product Enterprise owned at\n\nany Origin Point, and that Enterprise include all details about the transferee, the date and place of\n\ntransfer, and volumes. Magellan then demanded that Enterprise identify all volumes shipped\n\nfrom any Origin Point on systems other than the Eagle Ford pipeline, as well as detailed\n\nexplanations of other systems Enterprise used to transport crude, as well as the reasons those\n\nsystems were used.3\n\n         The parties continued with the audit of years 2014 and 2015 for several months, and on\n\nJune 6, 2017, Magellan commenced an audit for year 2016. By this time, Magellan had already\n\ninstituted the dispute resolution procedure set out in the Distribution Agreement. Thereafter, on\n\nJune 19, 2017, Magellan filed the instant lawsuit alleging breach of contract, reformation,\n\ndeclaratory judgment, promissory estoppel, and fraud.4\n\n         Enterprise maintains that the Distribution Agreement means only what the parties agreed\n\nit says: that crude starting at an Origin Point that goes through the Connection Point must travel\n\n2\n  See Def.’s Mot. for S.

It seeks communications and drafts of\n\nagreements between Enterprise and its customers, revealing Enterprise’s negotiating strategies\n\nwith respect to the same customers Magellan seeks.

ARGUMENT\n\nA.     The Court Should Stay all Discovery Until it Resolves the Threshold Issue of\n       Whether the Parties’ Agreements Are Unambiguous.\n\n       Because the resolution of a pending, threshold issue of contractual interpretation stands to\n\ndispose of the entire case and moot any need for factual discovery, the Court should enter an\n\norder staying all discovery until that threshold issue is resolved. Indeed, this case turns on a\n\npurely legal issue of contract interpretation and the discovery Magellan seeks is unnecessary to\n\nresolve this question. Trial courts have been given “broad discretion to schedule and define the\n\nscope of discovery,” and should “limit discovery when ‘the burden or expense of the proposed\n\ndiscovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in\n\ncontroversy, the parties’ resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the\n\nimportance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.’” Id. (quoting Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n192.4(b)). Such discovery limitations are especially appropriate pending resolution of important\n\nthreshold issues that may moot the need for further discovery, such as jurisdictional issues, id.; or\n\nissues of contract interpretation, see, e.g., Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. CBI\n\nIndus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex. 1995).\n\n       In CBI Industries, the Texas Supreme Court affirmed a trial court’s judgment awarding\n\nsummary judgment to the defendant-insurers on the plaintiff’s declaratory judgment and breach\n\nof contract claims, even though the trial court granted the motion before allowing the plaintiff\n\nany discovery. Id. at 520–21. The plaintiff in CBI Industries sued various insurance companies\n\nfor declaratory relief and breach of contract after the insurers denied plaintiff coverage for claims\n\narising out of a toxic spill. Id. at 519. Before plaintiff had conducted any discovery, the insurers\n\nmoved for summary judgment against the plaintiff’s claims, arguing that they were entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law because an unambiguous policy exclusion exempted plaintiff’s\n\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

Id. The trial court agreed and granted the insurers’ motion. Id.\n\nOn appeal, the court of appeals reversed the trial court’s judgment because, in the court of\n\nappeals’ view, the trial court could not decide the insurers’ summary judgment motion without\n\nfirst giving the plaintiff “‘sufficient time to make reasonable attempts to discover evidence on the\n\nissue of applying the contract to the subject matter with which it deals, and thereby raise a fact\n\nissue on latent ambiguity.’” Id. at 520 (quoting CBI Indus., 860 S.W.2d 662, 666 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1993)). The Texas Supreme Court disagreed with the court of appeals’\n\nreasoning, however, and reversed its decision. Id. at 520–21.\n\n           The Texas Supreme Court examined the language of the insurance agreement at issue and\n\nagreed with the trial court that such language unambiguously excluded the plaintiff’s insurance\n\nclaims from coverage. Id. The Court therefore held that there were no factual issues meriting\n\ndiscovery, and that the court of appeals erred in requiring the trial court to give the plaintiff a\n\nchance to obtain discovery from the insurers in the hopes of manufacturing contractual\n\nambiguity with inadmissible parol evidence. Id. at 522; see also In re Am. Home Assur. Co., 88\n\nS.W.3d 370, 376–77 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2002, no pet.) (holding that, on remand, the trial\n\ncourt should not permit plaintiff to obtain discovery of either the insurers’ deliberations in\n\ndrafting plaintiffs’ insurance policy, or the insurers’ communications with state insurance\n\nregulators regarding the policy, without first deciding whether the contract was ambiguous and\n\ntherefore susceptible to the use of such parol evidence).\n\n           Like the defendants in CBI Industries, Enterprise has argued in its summary judgment\n\nmotion that the plain and unambiguous language of the parties’ agreements precludes Magellan\n\nfrom obtaining any of the relief it seeks.6 If Enterprise’s arguments are correct (and they are),\n\nthen, as in CBI Industries, there are no factual issues meriting discovery, and therefore no reason\n6\n    Def.’s Mot. for S.

The Court should therefore enter an order protecting\n\nEnterprise from the burden of having to respond to Magellan’s discovery requests until the Court\n\ndecides this threshold issue.\n\nB.     The Court Should Protect Enterprise from Magellan’s Requests Seeking\n       Inadmissible Parol Evidence Because the Information Sought is Not Relevant.\n\n       Several of Magellan’s requests seek parol evidence that has no legitimate bearing on the\n\nparties’ dispute in light of the legal arguments raised in Enterprise’s summary judgment motion.\n\nDiscovery requests that seek production of patently irrelevant information are overbroad because\n\nsuch requests “impose[] a burden on the producing party far out of proportion to any benefit that\n\nmay obtain to the requesting party.” In re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d 149, 153 (Tex. 2003).\n\nMoreover, because overbroad requests for irrelevant information are improper whether they are\n\nburdensome or not, a responding party is not required to detail what burdens such requests might\n\nencompass. In re Allstate County Mut. Ins. Co., 227 S.W.3d 667, 670 (Tex. 2007). Nor is a\n\nresponding party required to assert claims of privilege in response to overbroad discovery\n\nrequests; assertions of privilege are required only after a party has served proper discovery\n\nrequests and overbroad requests are improper by definition. See Texaco, Inc. v. Sanderson, 898\n\nS.W.2d 813, 815 (Tex. 1995).\n\n       Parol evidence is inadmissible to alter the meaning of an unambiguous contract. Texas\n\nlaw prohibits “fishing expeditions” like those attempted by Magellan in the absence of a finding\n\nby the court that a contract is ambiguous. CBI Industries, Inc., 907 S.W.2d at 520, 522 (Tex.\n\n1995) (awarding summary judgment prior to any discovery because insurance contract was not\n\nambiguous).

For example, the requests seek information about transportation and\n\ndistribution of crude oil to any “Future Destination Point” – facilities it is undisputed that\n\nMagellan never constructed.11 In their totality, the requests would require Enterprise to disclose\n\nits entire distribution network and pricing structure, 12 and lay open all of its customer\n\narrangements in the region.13\n\n         The particulars of Enterprise’s business plans and strategies, the terms of its contracts,\n\nand the routing of product through its distribution system are not known outside the business,\n\nexcept for the individual participants in a transaction. No one outside of Enterprise has a 360-\n\ndegree view of the company’s operations, which is what Magellan seeks here. Enterprise does\n\nnot even make such information generally available to its employees. Only Enterprise’s senior\n\nexecutives and the individuals within Enterprise participating in the transaction have access to\n\ncustomer contract terms, which also include confidentiality provisions. Only senior executives\n\nand the crude marketing group at Enterprise are privy to the company’s business plans, and only\n\nexecutives charged with developing strategy and those employees executing them have access to\n\nsuch comprehensive information about the operations of Enterprise’s crude oil business in this\n\n11\n   E.g., Exhibit A (RFP Nos. 28-29).\n12\n   Id., No. 10 (seeking “plans, proposals, goals, projections, budgets, estimates, statistics or histories” of marketing,\ntransportation or delivery of crude); 24 (seeking “all existing Enterprise reports or analyses” relating to Eagle Ford\ncrude, regardless of destination point), 25-26 (seeking information providing Magellan with same assessment and\ntracing capabilities as Enterprise maintains for its own internal use); 17-23 (documents relating to contracts between\nEnterprise and its customers, including Enterprise’s own negotiating strategies; 27 (charges for crude transported out\nof ECHO terminal).\n13\n   Id., Nos. 17-23, 27.\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

Enterprise has invested substantial man-hours and capital in developing its contractual\n\nrelations and operational systems, knowledge of which would give a competitor as substantial\n\nadvantage in the Eagle Ford market. For this reason, Enterprise secures its information by\n\nmaintaining tight security and visitor controls in its buildings, password protecting its computer\n\nsystem, including confidentiality clauses in its contracts, conditioning any joint venture on a\n\nnondisclosure agreement, and sharing information internally on a need-to-know basis.\n\nEnterprise’s competitors are not able to recreate this information from public sources. See In re\n\nUnion Pac. R.R., 294 S.W.3d 589, 592 (Tex.2009) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam) (citing In re\n\nBass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex.2003) (orig. proceeding)).\n\n       Because the information sought are trade secrets of Enterprise, Magellan bears the burden\n\nof establishing that the information is necessary for a fair adjudication of its claims.

Marshall, 925 S.W.2d 672, 683 (Tex. 1996) (orig.\n\nproceeding) (mandamus relief may be justified when burden on producing party is far out of\n\nproportion to any benefit to requesting party). Enterprise should not be required to lay open its\n\nentire operations and strategies within the Eagle Ford region in response to Magellan’s fishing\n\nexpedition.\n\nD.         The Court Should Protect Enterprise from Magellan’s Subpoenas to Enterprise\n           Customers Containing Unduly Burdensome and Duplicative Requests.\n\n           While the discovery rules are intended to make litigation fair, the pragmatic reality is that\n\ndiscovery is often used as “a weapon capable of imposing large and unjustifiable costs on one’s\n\nadversary.” In re Alford Chevrolet-Geo, 997 S.W.2d 173, 180 (Tex. 1999) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Indeed, “[b]ecause costs of compliance [with a requesting party’s discovery\n\nrequests] are usually borne solely by the replying party, a requesting party improves its\n\nbargaining position by maximizing those costs.” Id. Thus it is often the case that “[l]itigants\n\nwith weak cases . . . heap costs on the adverse party,” in the hopes that “these higher costs lead[]\n\nthe other side to settle on favorable terms.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Consistent with its efforts to increase litigation costs and thus its bargaining position,\n\nMagellan served substantively identical subpoenas on three of Enterprise’s customers.14 The\n\n\n14\n     See generally Exhibits B-D.\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

For all the reasons stated above, a protective\n\norder is warranted.\n\n       Protection is additionally warranted as to the subpoenas because Enterprise’s customers\n\nare strangers to this litigation. A party causing a subpoena to be served is required to take\n\nreasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on the entity served. TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n176.7. The Texas rule, like its federal counterpart, “afford[s] nonparties special protection\n\nagainst the time and expense of complying with subpoenas.” Exxon Shipping Co. v. U.S. Dept. of\n\nInterior, 34 F.3d 774, 780 (9th Cir. 1994). Indeed, the Texas rules require subpoenas to be\n\ncurtailed if the discovery sought is: (i) unreasonably cumulative or duplicative; (ii) obtainable\n\nfrom some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; or (iii) the\n\nburden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. See TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n192.4. “[T]he word ‘should’ in Rule 192.4 is a directive to the trial court to limit discovery when\n\neither subsection is satisfied.” See In re Arras, 24 S.W.3d 862, 864 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2000,\n\norig. proceeding). Magellan’s third-party subpoenas suffer from at least three of the infirmities\n\nlisted in Rule 192.4.\n\n       What is more, the requests are duplicative and seek information obtainable from another\n\nsource – i.e., Enterprise.   A responding party is entitled to a protective order if a party’s\n\ndiscovery requests require “the production of patently irrelevant or duplicative documents, such\n\nthat it clearly constitutes harassment or imposes a burden on the producing party far out of\n\nproportion to any benefit that may obtain to the requesting party.” Walker v. Packer, 827\n\n\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

Instead of first attempting to obtain the information from\n\nEnterprise, Magellan’s served subpoenas containing identical request for production to\n\nEnterprise’s non-party customers. The fact that Magellan seeks the very same information from\n\nEnterprise as it does from these non-parties demonstrates that the information may be obtained\n\nfrom a less burdensome source. Accordingly, the Court should issue an order quashing the non-\n\nparty subpoenas until Enterprise has been given a full opportunity to object and respond to the\n\nsame requests for production, which in any event should be after the Court has resolved\n\nEnterprise’s pending motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                     IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the Court need not consider any extraneous evidence apart from the parties’\n\nunambiguous agreement in resolving this dispute, all discovery should be stayed until the Court\n\nhas resolved the threshold issue raised in Enterprise’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\nMoreover, despite the requirements that discovery requests be reasonably tailored to include only\n\nrelevant matters and not used to fish for information, Magellan served facially overbroad and\n\notherwise improper discovery requests on Enterprise and its customers that seek far more\n\ninformation than is relevant and fits the needs of this case. The Court should therefore enter a\n\nprotective order absolving Enterprise of its burden to respond to Magellan’s improper requests,\n\nand quash the non-party subpoenas.\n\n\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

(“Magellan”) submits this response\n\nin opposition to the no-evidence Motion for Summary Judgment (“Motion”) filed by Defendant\n\nEnterprise Crude Oil LLC (“Enterprise”) on August 4, 2017. This case arises from the parties’\n\nCrude Oil Distribution Agreement dated October 31, 2011 (“COD Agreement”), in which\n\nEnterprise made a 10-year “commitment” to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s Houston-area\n\ndistribution facilities in connection with the transportation of crude oil from the south Texas\n\nEagle Ford Shale play to certain destinations in Houston and the Texas gulf area. However\n\nEnterprise has purposely refused to honor that commitment. As a result, Magellan alleges breach\n\nof contract, fraud, and other related claims against Enterprise, and seeks an estimated $50 million\n\nor more in damages suffered to date.\n\n             Based primarily on a faulty, unreasonable interpretation of the COD Agreement,\n\nEnterprise asks this Court to determine all claims, on the merits, against Magellan, barely three\n\nmonths after the suit was filed and before Magellan has had any discovery whatsoever. The\n\nMotion should be denied, because Enterprise’s arguments are meritless, and its no-evidence\n\nMotion is premature and improper in any event.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 1\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               SR73\n\f                                       I.    SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n             The COD Agreement at the center of the case contains Enterprise’s express 10-year\n\n“commitment” to exclusively utilize Magellan’s Houston-area crude oil transportation and\n\ndistribution facilities for transportation of crude oil Enterprise that buys in the Eagle Ford Shale\n\nand markets to Houston-area refineries. The COD Agreement expressly states that Enterprise\n\nmade its long-term exclusive-use commitment to induce Magellan’s costly expansion of its\n\nfacilities, including (among other things) installation of new connections between the two\n\ncompanies’ respective pipelines, as necessary for Magellan to handle the Eagle Ford crude oil\n\ntransportation business Enterprise committed to Magellan.\n\n             Enterprise admits that it has not exclusively utilized Magellan’s facilities since they were\n\ncompleted and placed in operation four years ago, and admits that it has attempted to avoid its\n\ncontractual obligation by purposely circumventing the Magellan facilities in the very ways\n\nalleged in Magellan’s Original Petition,1 such as by:\n\n             (i)    moving Enterprise-owned Eagle Ford crude oil on a new segment of the Eagle\n                    Ford-to-Houston pipeline, which no longer extends directly to Magellan’s\n                    facilities (Rancho I) but skirts around the Magellan connection (Rancho II) and\n                    runs straight to Enterprise’s ECHO Terminal just beyond the Magellan connection\n                    (as depicted below):\n\n\n\n\n1\n   See Original Petition ¶¶ 52-60. Until it has discovery, Magellan will not know whether Enterprise has\ncircumvented Magellan in other ways, too.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 2\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            SR74\n\f                    and\n\n             (ii)   at Enterprise’s ECHO Terminal, selling the crude oil back to the same customer\n                    who sold the crude oil to Enterprise at one of the Eagle Ford Origin Points—\n                    pursuant to a buy-sell agreement which was made after the COD Agreement and\n                    which replaced an Enterprise crude oil purchase-only agreement (i.e., a\n                    marketing agreement) in place before the COD Agreement.\n\n             Specifically, Enterprise argues that under Section 4.1 of the COD Agreement, its\n\n“commitment” to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s facilities is “conditioned” upon certain\n\ncircumstances or events that have never occurred, namely (i) Enterprise’s continuous ownership\n\nor control of crude oil from end-to-end of the transport from an “Origin Point” (as defined) to a\n\n“Destination Point” (as defined), and (ii) Enterprise’s delivery of the crude oil to Magellan’s\n\nGenoa Junction “Connection Point” (as defined). Of course, those matters are within Enterprise’s\n\nexclusive control. Nevertheless, Enterprise claims that the “plain language” of the COD\n\nAgreement permits Enterprise to guarantee that the purported “conditions” never occur, and\n\nthereby avoid the commitment it made to Magellan. That is not what Section 4.1 says or may\n\nreasonably be interpreted to mean. Furthermore, under the well-established law discussed below,\n\nEnterprise is prohibited from avoiding its commitment in this manner..\n\n             For the Motion to succeed, as to Magellan’s claim for breach of contract, Enterprise must\n\ndemonstrate that its interpretation of the COD Agreement is correct as a matter of law—that the\n\ncontract is unambiguous and subject to no other reasonable interpretation. It cannot do so. By\n\nlaw, the contract language at issue must be read and construed in light of the surrounding\n\ncircumstances and purposes of the contract, taking into account the whole agreement, and\n\navoiding if possible any construction that would make other provisions meaningless or make a\n\nparty’s promise illusory. Also, for summary judgment purposes, all reasonable inferences must\n\nbe drawn in favor of the non-movant (Magellan). When the COD Agreement is construed\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 3\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR75\n\faccording to these well-settled rules, Enterprise’s view of the meaning and intent of the language\n\nused in the “transportation commitment” section (Section 4.1) of the COD Agreement is not\n\nreasonable, and certainly is not the only reasonable interpretation.\n\n             First, the language in Section 4.1 which Enterprise characterizes as a “condition” upon its\n\nobligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities—the words “provided, that such\n\ndeliveries … are … transported to the Connection Point”—do not constitute a “condition” upon\n\nEnterprise’s transportation commitment to make exclusive use of the Magellan facilities. Rather,\n\nthose words merely identify the specific location (the Magellan “Connection Point” at Genoa\n\nJunction) where Enterprise agrees to deliver crude into Magellan’s distribution system in\n\nfulfillment of the commitment to make exclusive use of the “Magellan Facilities” as defined. In\n\nother words, that language constitutes an Enterprise covenant, not a condition precedent to\n\nEnterprise’s obligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities.\n\n             Second, the COD Agreement contains no express requirement that Enterprise must\n\ncontinuously own or control the crude oil, from end-to-end of the transport from an Eagle Ford\n\n“Origin Point” (as defined) to a Houston-area “Destination Point” (as defined), for Enterprise’s\n\ntransportation commitment to apply. Viewing the agreement in its entirety, as required, strongly\n\nsupports Magellan’s position that Enterprise’s ownership or control of the crude at any Eagle\n\nFord Origin Point is sufficient to satisfy the ownership/control requirement.\n\n             Third, even if Enterprise’s interpretation of Section 4.1 were correct, the Motion would\n\nfail. Under settled contract law, Enterprise cannot avoid its transportation commitment by\n\npurposely causing any “conditions” within its control not to occur, whether by deliberately\n\nbypassing the Magellan Connection Point, by manipulating crude ownership/control downstream\n\nfrom an Origin Point where the crude was owned or controlled by Enterprise, or by other means.\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 4\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           SR76\n\fThis is true regardless of whether, as Enterprise contends, the COD Agreement is similar to an\n\n“output/requirements” contract; the applicable contract law is the same.\n\n             Similarly, Enterprise is not entitled, at this early stage, to summary judgment on any of\n\nthe four other claims alleged in Magellan’s Original Petition. Enterprise’s attack on those claims\n\nis largely founded on its erroneous interpretation of the COD Agreement and thus fails for the\n\nreasons noted above. In any event, all of those claims are viable, justiciable, and supported by\n\ncurrently available evidence and reasonable inferences sufficient to withstand the Motion.\n\n             Finally, but importantly, the Enterprise Motion is a no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment that is premature and improper, because Magellan has had no discovery, let alone the\n\n“adequate time for discovery” that Rule 166a(i) requires. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). All of\n\nEnterprise’s arguments are misguided and wrong on the merits, so denial of the Motion here and\n\nnow is appropriate. However, if the Court were inclined to believe that there could be some\n\nmerit in an argument made in the Motion, then pursuant to Rule 166a(g) the Court should defer\n\nany ruling and continue the Motion as needed to give Magellan adequate time and opportunity to\n\nconduct discovery essential to resolution of the Motion—discovery Enterprise has thus far\n\nblocked.\n\n                   II.    RESPONSE TO MOVANT’S STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS\n\n             Many of the assertions in Enterprise’s statement of undisputed “facts” are legal\n\narguments, contentions or conclusions, not facts. Magellan responds to such legal contentions\n\nand conclusions in its argument below. To the extent the Enterprise statement asserts actual facts\n\nnot specifically disputed below, Magellan reserves all rights to dispute at trial (after adequate\n\ndiscovery) the truth, relevance and/or admissibility of such facts.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 5\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR77\n\f             1.   Paragraph 5: Magellan disputes Enterprise’s legal conclusion as to what the “plain\n\nlanguage” of the COD Agreement means.\n\n             2.   Paragraphs 6-10: To the extent these paragraphs accurately reflect the express\n\nterms of the COD Agreement, Magellan does not dispute them. However, Magellan disputes all\n\nEnterprise characterizations of the contract’s express terms and their meaning or effect.\n\n             3.   Paragraph 14: This is a statement of law, not fact. To the extent facts are stated,\n\nMagellan disputes Enterprise’s assertion that the consideration for Magellan’s work and services\n\nconsisted of a mere commitment by Enterprise to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities\n\nin lieu of using the facilities owned by other non-Enterprise parties and originating at or near the\n\nlocation known as Genoa Junction. As shown on the face of the COD Agreement, the material\n\nconsideration Magellan bargained for (and got) was Enterprise’s promise to exclusively use\n\nfacilities owned by Magellan, not those owned by anyone else including Enterprise or its\n\naffiliates, to move Eagle Ford crude oil from any Origin Point to any Destination Point as those\n\nterms are defined in the COD Agreement.\n\n             4.   Paragraph 15: This statement is misleading. At the time Enterprise and Magellan\n\nentered into the COD Agreement, Magellan was considering whether to build the New Magellan\n\nFacilities. To the extent Enterprise’s statement suggests that even without Enterprise’s long-term\n\nexclusive use commitment, Magellan would have invested the many millions of dollars it did\n\ninvest to expand its Houston-area crude oil distribution system as described in the COD\n\nAgreement, the statement is false.\n\n             5.   Paragraph 16: Magellan disputes this statement. Enterprise has not “performed as\n\nrequired.” To the extent any Eagle Ford crude that Enterprise owned at an Origin Point has ever\n\nmoved on the Magellan Facilities, it was not transported on the Magellan Facilities “pursuant to”\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 6\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR78\n\fthe COD Agreement. Since September 2013, Enterprise has purchased and marketed an\n\nestimated 175,000,000 barrels (or more) of Eagle Ford crude oil to Houston-area destinations,\n\nyet none of those barrels were transported to or through the Magellan Facilities pursuant to and\n\nas required by the COD Agreement. Enterprise has not gone out of business, nor has it ceased\n\nshipping crude oil from the Origin Points to the Destination Points. Rather, it has merely decided\n\nto use other facilities—especially its own facilities—to move its Eagle Ford crude oil between\n\nOrigin Points and Destination Points. This is a clear breach of Enterprise’s exclusive-use\n\ncommitment to Magellan.\n\n             6.   Paragraph   19:   Magellan    disputes   all   legal   conclusions   and    factual\n\ncharacterizations in paragraph 19. Magellan agrees with Enterprise’s assessment of the utility of\n\nECHO Terminal. The utility of this facility was not lost on Magellan. Indeed, that is precisely\n\nwhy Magellan insisted on Enterprise’s firm commitment that it would use the Magellan\n\nFacilities, not its own, for all crude oil deliveries from any Origin Point to any Destination Point.\n\n             7.   Paragraph 20: Magellan disputes this statement. Although this statement may\n\nhave some truthful elements, without the benefit of the discovery to which it is entitled,\n\nMagellan cannot adequately assess the truth or otherwise respond to Enterprise’s assertions.\n\n             8.   Paragraph 21: This is a conclusion of law, not a statement of fact. To the extent\n\nfacts are stated, Magellan disputes Enterprise’s assertion that the COD Agreement permits\n\nEnterprise to defeat its performance obligation either by refusing to deliver crude to the Magellan\n\nConnection Point or by manipulating ownership of crude downstream from an Origin Point\n\nwhere Enterprise owned it. Not only does the COD Agreement, construed as a whole, prohibit\n\nsuch conduct, but well-settled law prohibits Enterprise from engaging in such conduct. At the\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 7\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR79\n\fvery least, Enterprise’s own statements raise issues that would require discovery before its\n\nassertions could be validly tested and addressed, thus precluding summary judgment.\n\n             9.    Paragraph 22: Magellan does not dispute that Enterprise publicly disclosed its\n\nconstruction of the Rancho II pipeline, and Magellan does not claim to have “objected.”\n\nHowever, the inference drawn by Enterprise is false. Magellan had no reason to object because\n\nMagellan had already secured Enterprise’s firm commitment that it would “exclusively utilize the\n\nMagellan Facilities” to deliver its crude oil from any Origin Point to any Destination Point,\n\nregardless. As the non-movant, Magellan is entitled to have all inferences drawn in its favor. All\n\nother statements in paragraph 22 are disputed. In addition, Enterprise asserts facts outside the\n\nfour corners of the COD Agreement that it claims are material to its Motion, yet seeks to prohibit\n\nMagellan from conducting discovery as to those very factual allegations. Without the benefit of\n\nthe discovery to which it is entitled, Magellan cannot adequately assess the truth or otherwise\n\nrespond to Enterprise’s assertions.\n\n             10.   Paragraph 23: Magellan does not dispute that Enterprise acquired Oiltanking\n\nPartners, L.P. in 2014, nor does Magellan claim that it sought to “enjoin” that acquisition.\n\nHowever, the inference drawn by Enterprise is false. Magellan had no reason to seek any such\n\ninjunction because Magellan had already secured Enterprise’s firm commitment that it would\n\n“exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities” to deliver its crude oil from any Origin Point to any\n\nDestination Point, regardless. As the non-movant, Magellan is entitled to have all inferences\n\ndrawn in its favor. All other statements in paragraph 22 are disputed. Again, to support its\n\nMotion, Enterprise relies on its own factual allegations about matters outside the four corners of\n\nthe COD Agreement, but seeks to deny Magellan discovery as to facts Enterprise apparently\n\nbelieves to be essential to a decision on the issues presented in its Motion. Without the benefit of\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 8\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR80\n\fthe discovery to which it is entitled, Magellan cannot adequately assess the truth or otherwise\n\nrespond to Enterprise’s assertions.\n\n             11.    Paragraphs 25–26: Magellan does not dispute the authenticity the document\n\nidentified as Exhibit 2-C to Enterprise’s Motion. Magellan does, however, dispute Enterprise’s\n\nslanted characterization of the email exchange reflected therein. The document speaks for itself.\n\nMoreover, Enterprise’s reliance on the statements contained in Exhibit 2-C contradicts its\n\ncontention that the Court must construe the COD Agreement by examining only the four corners\n\nof the contract and nothing else (which is not the law in any event).\n\nIII.         PLAINTIFF’S STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL FACTS AND SUMMARY JUDGMENT EVIDENCE\n\n             In opposition to the Motion, Magellan submits the following evidence supporting the\n\nfacts set forth below:\n\n             Exhibit 1:    Affidavit of Mark E. Daggett (“Daggett Aff.”)\n\n                    Exhibit 1-A: Jake Everett Email to Mark Daggett, Oct. 18, 2011\n\n                    Exhibit 1-B:   Crude Oil Distribution Agreement, Oct. 31, 2011\n\n                    Exhibit 1-C:   Joint Tariff Agreement, Nov. 1, 2011\n\n                    Exhibit 1-D: Connection Agreement, Dec. 16, 2011\n\n                    Exhibit 1-E:   Crude Oil Purchase Agreement, April 29, 2011 (redacted), and\n                                   First Amended and Restated Crude Oil Purchase and Sale\n                                   Agreement, Jan. 31, 2011 (redacted)\n\n                    Exhibit 1-F:   Enterprise Pipeline Local Tariff, July 1, 2017\n\n             Exhibit 2:    Affidavit of David L.

Magellan owns and operates pipelines and related facilities for the transportation\n\nand distribution of crude oil. Magellan’s facilities in and around the Houston area distribute\n\ncrude oil to refineries and other locations across the Texas Gulf Coast. Those facilities can be\n\naccessed through a point of connection Magellan maintains at a southeast Houston location\n\nknown as Genoa Junction. Daggett Aff. ¶ 2.\n\n             2.   Enterprise is a crude oil marketing company. It purchases crude oil from third\n\nparties and generates revenues by marketing, storing, and transporting the same. In Texas,\n\nEnterprise purchases and markets crude oil produced in, among other regions, a south Texas\n\nproduction area known as the Eagle Ford Shale. Daggett Aff. ¶ 3.\n\n             3.   Enterprise Crude Pipeline LLC (“Enterprise Pipeline”) is an affiliate of\n\nEnterprise. Enterprise Pipeline owns or operates numerous pipeline facilities in Texas. Those\n\nfacilities include a 24-inch diameter crude oil pipeline extending from locations in the Eagle\n\nFord Shale, to Enterprise Pipeline’s facilities in Sealy, Texas, to destinations in the Houston,\n\nTexas area, and the facility known as ECHO Terminal, which is located a few miles southeast of\n\nGenoa Junction. Daggett Aff. ¶¶ 2, 4.\n\n             4.   In 2011, Magellan’s existing facilities in the Houston area included (i) a 26-inch\n\ndiameter pipeline extending from Genoa Junction to BP’s Texas City Refinery in Galveston\n\nCounty and (ii) a 24-inch diameter pipeline extending from Speed Junction to Valero’s Houston\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 10\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR82\n\fRefinery. In the COD Agreement, those were referred to collectively as the “Existing Magellan\n\nFacilities.” Daggett Aff. ¶ 5.\n\n             5.   In the spring of 2011, Magellan was considering whether to construct new\n\npipeline facilities in the Houston area in order to expand and improve its facilities for distribution\n\nof crude oil from the Eagle Ford Shale to refineries and other destinations in the Houston area. In\n\nthe COD Agreement, those were collectively described as the “New Magellan Facilities,” and\n\ntogether with the Existing Magellan Facilities, were described as the “Magellan Facilities.”\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 6.\n\n             6.   The anticipated cost of construction for the New Magellan Facilities was\n\nsignificant. For that reason, Magellan determined that it would not proceed with the project\n\nwithout first obtaining a long-term contract that would provide revenues sufficient to assure the\n\nproject’s commercial and financial viability. Daggett Aff. ¶ 7.\n\n             7.   In mid-2011, Magellan entered into discussions with Enterprise to determine\n\nEnterprise’s interest in utilizing the Magellan Facilities. Specifically, Magellan explored\n\nEnterprise’s willingness to provide, in consideration of incentive tariff rates to be charged by\n\nMagellan, a binding commitment to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities with respect to\n\ntransportation of Eagle Ford crude oil that Enterprise or its affiliates owned or controlled at\n\npoints of origin along Enterprise Pipeline’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system, and for\n\ndistribution and delivery to various Houston-area refineries or other destinations served or to be\n\nserved by the Magellan Facilities. In the parties’ discussions, Enterprise expressed both a need\n\nand a desire to utilize the Magellan Facilities for such purposes. Daggett Aff. ¶ 8.\n\n             8.   Based on Enterprise’s expression of interest, Magellan and Enterprise proceeded\n\nto negotiate—over a period of approximately four months, from July 2011 through October\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 11\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR83\n\f2011—the terms of an agreement providing for Enterprise’s long-term commitment to\n\nexclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities. Through such negotiations, the parties reached an\n\nagreement that for 10 years after the New Magellan Facilities were completed and operational,\n\nand for all crude oil that Enterprise or its affiliates owned or controlled at any of four agreed-\n\nupon Eagle Ford “Origin Points” and transported on Enterprise Pipeline’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston\n\npipeline system, Enterprise would exclusively utilize (and use “best efforts” to cause its affiliates\n\nto exclusively utilize) the Magellan Facilities in order to deliver such crude oil to any of several\n\nagreed-upon “Destination Points.” That is, the parties agreed that such crude oil could not be\n\ndelivered to any such Destination Point without utilizing Magellan’s Houston-area crude oil\n\ndistribution system, accessible at Genoa Junction. Daggett Aff. ¶ 9.\n\n             9.   On October 18, 2011, near the end of the parties’ documentation of their\n\nagreement, Magellan’s principal contract negotiator, Mark Daggett, received an email from one\n\nof the Enterprise negotiators, Jake Everett, proposing to modify the COD Agreement’s definition\n\nof the term “Controlled.” In his message, Mr. Everett explained Enterprise’s understanding of the\n\nparties’ agreement, and its reason for requesting the modification. In relevant part, Mr. Everett’s\n\nemail stated:\n\n                  We would like to revise the definition of “Control” to eliminate the clause\n                  on legal authorization to transport. Our affiliate, Enterprise Crude Oil\n                  Pipeline will be transporting crude for 3rd parties under transportation\n                  agreement rather than a marketing agreement so only the 3rd party will\n                  have authority to determine the ultimate destination.\n\n                  I believe the intent of the agreement was for all of the marketing\n                  volume to move through these [Magellan] connections and that is our\n                  intent, but as soon as a 3rd party requests a delivery outside of this\n                  agreement, we don’t want to be in default. Please let me know if you\n                  disagree with our interpretation.\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 10, Ex. 1-A (emphasis added).\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 12\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR84\n\f             10.   On the same date, October 18, 2011, Mr. Everett and Mr. Daggett discussed\n\nEnterprise’s proposed modification by phone. In that conversation, Mr. Everett reaffirmed\n\nEnterprise’s agreement that all crude oil Enterprise owned or controlled at any time at any\n\nspecified Origin Point (i.e., all Enterprise “marketing volume”) and transported via Enterprise\n\nPipeline’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system would be delivered into Magellan’s Houston-\n\narea distribution system if such crude oil was to be distributed and delivered to any specified\n\nDestination Point. Mr. Everett also reaffirmed that the sole reason for Enterprise’s request to\n\nmodify the definition of “Control” was to distinguish between (i) on the one hand, Enterprise’s\n\n“marketing volumes” of crude oil—i.e., crude oil Enterprise (the marketing company) purchased\n\nfrom third parties and owned or controlled at an Eagle Ford origin point—all of which would be\n\ntransported exclusively to and through the Magellan Facilities if destined for any of the\n\nDestination Points, and (ii) on the other hand, Enterprise Pipeline’s “transportation volumes”—\n\ni.e., crude oil owned by third parties (not by Enterprise) that Enterprise Pipeline would be\n\ntransporting on its Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system in the name and for the account of a\n\nthird party and delivering to a destination point according to the third party’s independent\n\ndirection—which volumes would not be subject to Enterprise’s commitment to exclusively\n\nutilize the Magellan Facilities. Mr. Everett did not state or imply that those “transportation\n\nvolumes” excluded from Enterprise’s commitment to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s facilities\n\ncould, would, or might also include crude oil that Enterprise had previously owned or controlled.\n\nFurther, he did not state or imply that Enterprise desired or intended to have an agreement which\n\nprovided Enterprise a mere option, as opposed to a binding commitment, to transport its\n\n“marketing volumes” of Eagle Ford crude oil to and through the Magellan Facilities prior to\n\nbeing delivered to a specified Destination Point. Finally, Mr. Everett did not state or imply that\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 13\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     SR85\n\fafter Enterprise entered into the agreement with Magellan, Enterprise or Enterprise Pipeline\n\ncould, would, or might modify the existing Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system in order to\n\nbypass the Genoa Junction connection point into Magellan’s Houston-area distribution system.\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 11.\n\n             11.   The next day, October 19, 2011, Enterprise presented to Magellan a modified\n\ndraft of the parties’ written agreement, in which Enterprise had altered the prior definitions of\n\n“Controlled” and “Owned” by adding the provisos underscored below:\n\n                   1.6 “Controlled” shall mean, when referring to Product, Product that\n                   Shipper or its Affiliates, as the case may be, has the legal right to\n                   transport; provided, however, the custody of Product by an Affiliate of\n                   Shipper that is transporting such Product for the account of a party or\n                   parties other than Shipper or its Affiliates does not constitute Control.\n\n                   1.32 “Owned” shall mean Product to which Shipper or its Affiliate holds\n                   title; provided, however, the custody of Product by an Affiliate of Shipper\n                   that is transporting such Product for the account of a party or parties other\n                   than Shipper or its Affiliates does not constitute being Owned.\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 12.\n\n             12.   Magellan accepted as true, and relied upon, Enterprise’s representations that by\n\nsuggesting such alterations, Enterprise was not attempting to change the substance or effect of\n\nthe parties’ agreement, i.e., that Enterprise was committing to move through the Magellan\n\nFacilities all of the Enterprise “marketing volume” of crude oil, consisting of all crude oil which\n\nEnterprise (the marketing company) owned or controlled at any time. Magellan also accepted as\n\ntrue, and relied upon, Enterprise’s representation that the “transportation volumes” being\n\nexcluded from the scope of the parties’ agreement referred only to third-party-owned crude oil\n\nthat Enterprise Pipeline would be transporting from Eagle Ford origins under bona fide\n\ntransportation agreements which gave such third parties (not Enterprise) the sole legal right to\n\ndetermine where and how their crude oil would be delivered. Unaware of the buy-sell scheme\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 14\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      SR86\n\fEnterprise began to employ soon after it signed the COD Agreement (as discussed below),\n\nMagellan also relied upon the absence of any disclosure by Enterprise that such excluded\n\n“transportation volumes” could, would, or might include crude oil that Enterprise (the marketing\n\ncompany) ever owned or controlled. Accordingly, Magellan accepted and agreed to Enterprise’s\n\nproposed modifications of the contract definitions of “Controlled” and “Owned” as described\n\nabove. Daggett Aff. ¶ 13.\n\n             13.   Enterprise and Magellan executed the COD Agreement, effective October 31,\n\n2011. Daggett Aff. ¶ 14; Ex. 1-B.\n\n             14.   On November 1, 2011, Enterprise Pipeline and Magellan executed a letter\n\nagreement (the “Joint Tariff Agreement”) concerning the joint tariff for transportation of crude\n\noil as contemplated by the COD Agreement. Daggett Aff. ¶ 15, Ex. 1-C. The COD Agreement\n\nspecifically refers to and incorporates the Joint Tariff Agreement. See COD Agreement, Ex. 1-B,\n\nSection 3.1 at 5. The Joint Tariff Agreement expresses Enterprise’s commitment as follows:\n\n                   [T]he shipper agrees to ship under the Joint Tariff all crude owned or\n                   controlled by it from an Origin Point through the Connection Point to a\n                   Destination Point.\n\nEx. 1-C (emphasis added).\n\n             15.   To facilitate and implement the delivery of crude oil to and through the Magellan\n\nFacilities, in accordance with the commitment Enterprise made under the COD Agreement,\n\nMagellan and Enterprise Pipeline also negotiated and entered into a new pipeline connection\n\nagreement effective December 16, 2011 (the “Connection Agreement”). Daggett Aff. ¶ 16.\n\n             16.   In reliance upon the representations and commitments Enterprise made to\n\nMagellan, and the parties’ resulting agreements, as described above, Magellan proceeded to\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 15\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR87\n\fconstruct the New Magellan Facilities. Construction of the New Magellan Facilities took\n\napproximately 18 months, at a cost of $20 million or more. Daggett Aff. ¶ 17.\n\n             17.   At no time during this construction did Enterprise inform Magellan that\n\nEnterprise desired to amend its contractual commitment to exclusively utilize the Magellan\n\nFacilities, or that Enterprise viewed the COD Agreement as giving Enterprise an option, but no\n\nobligation, to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities. Daggett Aff. ¶ 18.\n\n             18.   On June 3, 2013, Magellan provided written notice to Enterprise that the New\n\nMagellan Facilities would be operational and ready for service on July 1, 2013. Pursuant to\n\nSection 2.1 of the COD Agreement, the “In-Service Date” occurred on July 1, 2013. Pursuant to\n\nSection 2.1 of the COD Agreement, Enterprise’s 10-year commitment to exclusively utilize the\n\nMagellan Facilities began on July 1, 2013 and extends to July 1, 2023. Daggett Aff. ¶ 19.\n\n             19.   Following the In-Service Date, Enterprise failed and refused to make crude oil\n\nshipments to or through the Magellan Facilities, pursuant to the terms of the COD Agreement.\n\nThe limited data Enterprise has provided to date in response to Magellan’s audit requests\n\nindicates that since September 2013, Enterprise has purchased and marketed over 175,000,000\n\nbarrels of Eagle Ford crude oil that did not move through the Magellan Facilities. Daggett Aff. ¶\n\n20.\n\n             20.   When the parties entered into the COD Agreement in 2011, and when the In-\n\nService Date occurred in 2013, Enterprise Pipeline’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system\n\nextended, via Enterprise Pipeline’s Rancho pipeline, directly to the Genoa Junction connection\n\npoint with Magellan’s Houston-area distribution system. After signing the COD Agreement,\n\nhowever, Enterprise Pipeline constructed a new crude oil pipeline dubbed the “Rancho II,”\n\nconsisting of approximately 88 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline extending from Sealy directly\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 16\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    SR88\n\fto ECHO Terminal. Unlike the preexisting Rancho pipeline from Sealy to Houston, which\n\nEnterprise Pipeline renamed as “Rancho I,” the Rancho II pipeline completely bypasses the\n\nGenoa Junction connection point with Magellan’s Houston-area crude oil distribution system.\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 21.\n\n             21.   In April 2015, Magellan invoked it rights, pursuant to Section 4.4 of the COD\n\nAgreement, to conduct an audit of Enterprise’s compliance with the COD Agreement. During the\n\ncourse of that audit, Magellan uncovered evidence that, shortly after signing the COD\n\nAgreement, Enterprise began using third-party buy-sell contracts to circumvent its obligations\n\nunder the COD Agreement. Specifically, Magellan discovered that Enterprise had, for at least\n\nthree different third-party producers, replaced its preexisting third-party marketing contract,\n\nwhich provided only for Enterprise’s purchase of the third-party’s Eagle Ford crude oil\n\nproduction, with new buy-sell contracts which allowed Enterprise to buy the third-party’s Eagle\n\nFord crude oil production and then resell the same volume of crude oil back to the third-party\n\nproducer downstream of the Eagle Ford Origin Point but before the crude oil reached the\n\nMagellan Connection Point at Genoa Junction. Daggett Aff. ¶ 22; Ex. 1-E.\n\n             22.   Enterprise began utilizing that buy-sell scheme no later than January 2012. During\n\nthis time, Enterprise never told Magellan that it was replacing its Eagle Ford crude oil purchase\n\nagreements with buy-sell agreements. Daggett Aff. ¶ 23.\n\n             23.   In December 2015, while Magellan’s audit was pending, Enterprise Pipeline\n\nphysically disconnected its facilities at Anahuac Junction from Magellan’s Genoa Junction-to-\n\nTexas City pipeline. Daggett Aff. ¶ 24. The severance of the connection at Anahuac Junction\n\nbetween Magellan’s facilities and Enterprise Pipeline’s facilities occurred over Magellan’s\n\nobjection and made it impossible for Magellan to deliver crude oil into Enterprise Pipeline’s\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 17\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR89\n\fpipeline at Anahuac Junction, which is one of the four initial Destination Points specified in the\n\nCOD Agreement. Id. The severance of that connection was in breach of Enterprise Pipeline’s\n\nobligations under the Connection Agreement.\n\n             24.   In or about May 2017, Enterprise Pipeline posted a new tariff for transportation of\n\ncrude oil moving from ECHO Terminal to Magellan’s facilities at Genoa Junction. Under the\n\nnew tariff, effective as of July 1, 2017, Enterprise Pipeline has essentially doubled the local tariff\n\nan Enterprise customer must pay in order to transport crude oil (including crude oil the customer\n\nsold to Enterprise at an Eagle Ford Origin Point and bought back from Enterprise at ECHO\n\nTerminal) from ECHO Terminal to Magellan’s facilities at Genoa Junction, on Enterprise\n\nPipeline’s ECHO-to-Genoa Junction pipeline. By that means, Enterprise or its affiliates have\n\ndramatically increased the cost, and correspondingly decreased the economic incentive, for\n\nshippers to transport crude oil via Magellan’s Houston-area distribution system (instead of the\n\nEnterprise system) to any of the Destination Points specified in the COD Agreement. Daggett\n\nAff. ¶ 25.\n\n             25.   Magellan has served discovery requests to Enterprise and subpoenas duces tecum\n\nto three non-parties. Bryant Aff. ¶¶ 3, 5-6. The evidence Magellan has sought to discover\n\nthrough the above-described discovery requests is relevant to the claims Magellan asserts in this\n\naction, material to the resolution of the Motion, and potentially essential to the resolution of\n\nissues presented by the Motion. Id., ¶¶ 10-13. However, as a result of the Enterprise Motion for\n\nProtection and to Stay Discovery Pending Resolution of Defendant’s Dispositive Motion, and the\n\nparties’ subsequent Rule 11 agreement, Magellan has not had any discovery in this action and\n\nhas not had adequate time or opportunity to obtain any discovery.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS\n\n             Rule 166a provides for two different types of summary judgment motions by a\n\ndefendant—a “traditional” motion and a “no-evidence” motion—each with its own rules,\n\nrequirements, and procedures. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c), (i). Whether a summary judgment motion\n\nis a traditional motion or a no-evidence motion depends on “its substance, not its title or\n\ncaption.” Cohen v. Landry’s Inc., 442 S.W.3d 818, 823 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist] 2014,\n\npet. denied); Texas Integrated Conveyor Sys., Inc. v. Innovative Conveyor Concepts, Inc., 300\n\nS.W.3d 348, 375 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied). The reviewing court must determine the\n\nnature of a movant’s summary judgment motion as a threshold matter. Davis v. Canyon Creek\n\nEstates Homeowners Ass’n, 350 S.W.3d 301, 307 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011, pet. denied).\n\nA motion seeking relief on the ground that the plaintiff cannot produce any evidence to establish\n\nan essential element of one or more of its claims is properly viewed as a no-evidence motion\n\nunder Rule 166a(i). See Marts ex rel. Marts v. Transportation Ins. Co., 111 S.W.3d 699, 702\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, pet. denied).\n\n             A no-evidence summary judgment motion “is essentially a motion for a pretrial directed\n\nverdict.” Timpte Indus., Inc. v. Gish, 286 S.W.3d 306, 310 (Tex. 2009). A no-evidence motion\n\nseeks “summary judgment on the ground that there is no evidence of one or more essential\n\nelements of a claim or defense on which an adverse party would have the burden of proof at trial.\n\nThe motion must state the elements as to which there is no evidence.” Tex R. Civ. P. 166a(i).\n\n“To defeat a no-evidence motion, the non-movant must produce at least a scintilla of evidence\n\nraising a genuine issue of material fact as to the challenged elements.” Lightning Oil Co. v.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 19\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      SR91\n\fAnadarko E&P Onshore, LLC, 520 S.W.3d 39, 45 (Tex. 2017). The court must review such\n\nevidence “in the light most favorable to the non-movant,” and indulge “every reasonable\n\ninference … in that party’s favor.” Id. A party may move for no-evidence summary judgment\n\nonly “[a]fter adequate time for discovery.” Tex R. Civ. P. 166a(i).\n\n             “With a traditional motion for summary judgment, the movant has the initial burden of\n\nshowing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.” City of Anahuac v. Morris, 484 S.W.3d 176, 179–80 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2015, pet. denied). When the defendant moves for traditional summary\n\njudgment on a plaintiff’s claims, the defendant must “conclusively negate[] at least one of the\n\nessential elements of each of the plaintiff’s causes of action.” Cathey v. Booth, 900 S.W.2d 339,\n\n341 (Tex. 1995). A matter is conclusively established “only if reasonable people could not differ\n\nin their conclusions.” City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 816 (Tex. 2005). If the defendant\n\nmakes this showing, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to present evidence raising a genuine issue\n\nof material fact.” Kaplan v. City of Sugar Land, No. 14-15-00381-CV, 2017 WL 1287994, at *2\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Apr. 6, 2017, no pet.). Evidence raises a genuine issue of fact\n\nif “reasonable and fair-minded jurors could differ in their conclusions in light of all of the\n\nevidence presented.” Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mayes, 236 S.W.3d 754, 755 (Tex. 2007).\n\n“When reviewing a traditional motion for summary judgment, [the court must] review the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, indulge every reasonable inference in\n\nfavor of the non-movant, and resolve any doubts against the motion.” Lightning Oil Co., 520\n\nS.W.3d at 45.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 20\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      SR92\n\f                                    V.

ENTERPRISE IS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON MAGELLAN’S BREACH OF\n             CONTRACT CLAIM\n\n                1) Applicable Rules of Contract Interpretation\n\n             The parties agree that well-settled rules of contract interpretation must guide the Court’s\n\nanalysis of the issues presented by the Motion. However, contrary to Enterprise’s assertion,\n\nconstruing the COD Agreement in accordance with the applicable rules of contract interpretation\n\ndoes not support the interpretation Enterprise urges the Court to adopt as a matter of law, and\n\nthus does not support its Motion for summary judgment as to any of Magellan’s claims.\n\n             “When construing a contract, the court’s primary concern is to give effect to the written\n\nexpression of the parties’ intent.” Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 876 S.W.2d 132, 133 (Tex.\n\n1994). “In discerning the parties’ intent, [the court] must examine and consider the entire writing\n\nin an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be\n\nrendered meaningless.” El Paso Field Servs., L.P. v. MasTec N. Am., Inc., 389 S.W.3d 802, 805\n\n(Tex. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is, “[n]o single provision taken alone is\n\ngiven controlling effect; rather, each must be considered in the context of the instrument as a\n\nwhole.” Plains Expl. & Prod. Co. v. Torch Energy Advisors Inc., 473 S.W.3d 296, 305 (Tex.\n\n2015). An important corollary rule dictates that a court “construe [the] contract[] from a\n\nutilitarian standpoint bearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be served, and\n\navoiding unreasonable constructions when possible and proper.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n             To that end, the circumstances surrounding a written agreement must be considered by\n\nthe court, because they may assist the court in construing the language the parties used.

This includes consideration of “the undisputed evidence regarding [the\n\ncontract’s] negotiation and purpose.” Basic Capital Management v. Dynex Commercial, 348\n\nS.W.3d 894, 899 (Tex. 2011). Indeed, even when a court concludes that the parties’ contract is\n\nunambiguous, it may still consider the surrounding “facts and circumstances” as an “aid in the\n\nconstruction of the contract’s language.” Sun Oil Co. (Del.) v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 731\n\n(Tex. 1981). “In other words, the parol-evidence rule does not prohibit consideration of\n\nsurrounding circumstances that inform, rather than vary from or contradict, the contract text.”\n\nFirst Bank, 2017 WL 1968830, at *10 (internal quotation marks omitted).2\n\n             Determining whether a contract is ambiguous is a legal question for the court. Kachina\n\nPipeline Co., Inc. v. Lillis, 471 S.W.3d 445, 449 (Tex. 2015). A contract is ambiguous if it “is\n\nsubject to two or more reasonable interpretations after applying the pertinent rules of\n\nconstruction.” J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex. 2003) (emphasis\n\nadded). For example, the question of “[w]hether a contract is ambiguous … must be decided by\n\nexamining the contract as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the contract was\n\nentered.” Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v.

Conversely, a contract is unambiguous only if,\n\n2\n  Relatedly, Enterprise is incorrect when it asserts that the parol evidence rule “precludes enforcement of\nprior or contemporaneous agreements” (Motion at 15) and “preclude[s] [Magellan] from asserting fraud\non this basis” (Motion, n. 38 at 27), based on the fact that the COD Agreement contains a “merger” or\n“integration” clause.

For\n\nanyone less familiar with the territory, understanding what the transportation commitment set\n\nforth in Section 4.1 really means requires examination of the whole agreement (the full four\n\ncorners), and interpretation of the contract language “in light of the circumstances present when\n\nthe contract was entered,”3 viewed from a “utilitarian” (practical, common sense) standpoint\n\n“bearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be served, and avoiding unreasonable\n\nconstructions.”4\n\n                                       — The Context of the Contract —\n\n             As shown by the parties’ respective fact statements, at least some of the material\n\ncircumstances surrounding the COD Agreement are not in dispute. For example, Enterprise is a\n\ncrude oil marketing company which purchases its customers’ crude oil on location in a producing\n\nregion (e.g., Eagle Ford Shale) and then transports or “markets” it, via pipelines and distribution\n\n\n\n3\n    Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc., 352 S.W.3d at 449–50.\n4\n    Plains, 473 S.W.3d at 305.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 23\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR95\n\fsystems owned by Enterprise Pipeline, to refineries or other final destinations (e.g., Houston-area\n\nrefineries).\n\n             There is no dispute that when the parties entered into the COD Agreement, crude oil\n\nproduction in the Eagle Ford Shale was growing rapidly, creating a need for expanded\n\ntransportation and distribution facilities to move Eagle Ford crude oil to Houston-area\n\ndestinations. Magellan already had a substantial crude oil transportation and distribution system\n\nthat was directly connected and capable of delivering crude oil to multiple refineries in or near\n\nHouston, but was considering expansion of its Houston-area transportation and distribution\n\nfacilities. Enterprise Pipeline was also in the process of developing its Houston-area crude oil\n\nterminal facility known as ECHO Terminal, that could eventually compete with Magellan’s\n\nHouston-area crude oil distribution system. However, at the time, Enterprise Pipeline had a\n\npipeline system that originated in the Eagle Ford Shale and extended (via Rancho I pipeline) to a\n\npoint of connection into Magellan’s Houston-area distribution system at Genoa Junction.\n\n             Thus, Enterprise expressed to Magellan an immediate need and desire to utilize\n\nMagellan’s Houston-area systems, if and when Magellan completed an expansion that would\n\naccommodate the volume of Eagle Ford crude oil Enterprise anticipated marketing and\n\ndelivering to the Houston area. Enterprise and Magellan proceeded to negotiate the terms of the\n\nCOD Agreement over a period of about four months.\n\n             In the final stages of the parties’ documentation of their agreement, one of the Enterprise\n\nnegotiators represented to Magellan’s representative, in writing, that “I believe the intent of the\n\nagreement was for all of the marketing volume to move through these [Magellan]\n\nconnections and that is our [Enterprise’s] intent. . . .”5 And as reflected in COD Agreement,\n\n\n5\n    Ex. 1-A (emphasis added).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 24\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           SR96\n\fthe parties contemplated that Enterprise would deliver all such crude oil into the Magellan\n\ndistribution system at Genoa Junction, by one of two possible routes between an Origin Point\n\nand the Magellan connection point at Genoa Junction, i.e., either (i) directly from the existing\n\nEagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline (via Rancho I), or (ii) if Enterprise first moved the crude oil past\n\nMagellan’s Genoa Junction connection point to Enterprise’s nearby ECHO Terminal, then back\n\nto the Magellan connection point on an ECHO-to-Genoa Junction pipeline being constructed by\n\nEnterprise Pipeline.\n\n                                 — The Four Corners of the Contract —\n\n             The COD Agreement begins with a series of recitals. Regarding the existing Enterprise\n\nfacilities, one of the recitals states:\n\n                    Enterprise Pipeline owns the 24-inch diameter crude oil pipeline facility\n                    (“Eagle Ford Pipeline System”) that extends from the Origin Points (as\n                    hereafter defined) in south Texas to the Connection Point (as hereafter\n                    defined) with Magellan’s Genoa Junction and owns the Webster-area\n                    terminal located south of Genoa Junction (the “Echo Terminal”);6\n\n             The final recital in the COD Agreement states the essential purpose of the contract, as\n\nfollows:\n\n                    WHEREAS, Shipper, to facilitate Magellan’s construction of the New\n                    Magellan Facilities, is willing to provide the commitment described in this\n                    Agreement.7\n\nThat is, Enterprise made its long-term exclusive-use commitment for the express purpose of\n\ninducing Magellan’s costly construction of the New Magellan Facilities.\n\n             Then, the preamble states the parties’ mutual intention to be legally bound to perform\n\ntheir respective promises:\n\n\n\n6\n    Ex. 1-B at 1(bold original, underscore added).\n7\n    Ex. 1-B at 1(underscore added).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 25\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR97\n\f                    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual\n                    covenants and agreements contained herein, and of other good and\n                    valuable consideration the receipt, adequacy and sufficiency of which are\n                    acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Magellan and\n                    Shipper agree as follows:8\n\n             The 10-year term of contract is set forth in Section 2.1, which states in relevant part:\n\n                    2.1 Term. The term of this Agreement (“Term”) shall commence on the\n                    Effective Date and shall continue until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the\n                    In-Service Date (as hereinafter defined).9\n\n             The Shipper’s (Enterprise’s) transportation commitment is set forth in Section 4.1.\n\nCapitalized terms are defined elsewhere in the contract (as discussed more fully below):\n\n                    4.1 Transportation Commitment. Following the In-Service Date,\n                    Shipper agrees:\n\n                    A. to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities for all deliveries of\n                       Product that are Owned or Controlled by Shipper; and\n\n                    B. to use best efforts to cause Shipper’s Affiliates to exclusively use the\n                       Magellan Facilities for all deliveries of Product that are Owned or\n                       Controlled by any of its Affiliates;\n\n                    provided, that such deliveries are made from an Origin Point and are\n                    either:\n\n                    (i)     transported on the Eagle Ford Pipeline System through Echo\n                            Terminal to the Connection Point and delivered to any of the\n                            Destination Points, or\n\n                    (ii)    transported on the Eagle Ford Pipeline System to the Connection\n                            Point and delivered to any of the Destination Points.10\n\n                            — The Crux of the Summary Judgment Dispute —\n\n             Again, the issue before the Court is not whether Enterprise is deliberately bypassing\n\nMagellan altogether—it admittedly IS.

However, Enterprise is flatly wrong when it says that under the “plain\n\nlanguage” of the contract, Enterprise can wash its hands of the commitment simply by (i)\n\nchoosing to bypass the Magellan Connection Point instead of delivering Product to that\n\nConnection Point, or (ii) taking Product Enterprise purchases from a marketing customer and\n\nowns at an Origin Point, transporting the Product (in Enterprise’s own name and for its own\n\naccount) directly to Enterprise’s ECHO Terminal, and then choosing to sell the crude back to the\n\nsame customer at ECHO Terminal.\n\n             Indeed, the Enterprise interpretation of its “commitment” to “exclusively utilize”\n\nMagellan’s facilities could be restated as follows:\n\n                    “Shipper has the option, but not the obligation, to utilize the Magellan\n                    Facilities for transportation and delivery, to a Destination Point, of any\n\n11\n     Motion at 17 (all emphasis in original).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 27\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                              SR99\n\f                   Product that Shipper owns or controls at an Origin Point; provided, that\n                   Shipper reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to exclusively utilize its\n                   own facilities for all such deliveries.”\n\n             What Enterprise actually gave in Section 4.1, however, was a “commitment,” which\n\nmeans a “promise or pledge to do something,” not an option.12 To “exclusively utilize” also has\n\nspecific meaning, and does not suggest “optional” use of the Magellan Facilities. Had Enterprise\n\nso intended, it could have negotiated for an option to utilize Magellan’s facilities or not, at its\n\nwhim. However, the COD Agreement contains no such “option” language. The Joint Tariff also\n\nconfirms Enterprise’s commitment “to ship under the Joint Tariff all crude owned or controlled\n\nby it from an Origin Point through the Connection Point to a Destination Point.”13 And not\n\nsurprisingly, Enterprise offers no explanation or logical reason why Magellan or any other\n\nrational business in its position would have invested tens of millions of dollars based on they\n\ntype of hollow and worthless “commitment” Enterprise claims it made. In any case, the Motion\n\nmust fail because Enterprise’s currently professed view of Section 4.1’s “plain language” is not a\n\nreasonable interpretation, let alone the only reasonable interpretation.\n\n                3) Section 4.1 Cannot be Construed, As a Matter of Law, to Either:\n\n                   (i) “Condition” the Enterprise Commitment on delivery of crude to a\n                       Designated Magellan Connection Point, or\n\n                   (ii) Permit Enterprise to Avoid Its Commitment By Causing Product Not to\n                        Be Delivered to the Magellan Connection Point\n\n             Enterprise argues that, as a matter of law, it has not breached the COD Agreement\n\nbecause the Section 4.1 language—“provided, that such deliveries … are … transported to the\n\nConnection Point” with the Magellan Facilities—creates a “condition” precedent to Enterprise’s\n\n\n\n12\n     Webster’s New International Dictionary 539 (2d ed. 1945).\n13\n     Ex. 1-C (emphasis added).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 28\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      SR100\n\fobligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities, and that “condition” has never\n\noccurred.14 Properly construed, however, the language introduced by the words “provided, that”\n\ndoes not make Enterprise’s delivery of Product to the designated Magellan Connection Point a\n\n“condition” of the Enterprise commitment to use the Magellan Facilities originating there.\n\nFurther, if Enterprise’s commitment was truly conditioned on its delivery of Product to the\n\ndesignated Magellan Connection Point, by law Enterprise could not avoid the commitment to use\n\nthe Magellan Facilities by causing the delivery condition not to occur, such as by choosing to\n\ndeliver Product to its own facilities instead.\n\n                    a) The language Enterprise relies on does not create a condition precedent to\n                       Enterprise’s obligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities\n\n             “A condition precedent is an act or event that must take place before performance of a\n\ncontractual obligation is due.” Cedyco Corp. v. PetroQuest Energy, LLC, 497 F.3d 485, 488 (5th\n\nCir. 2007). Under Texas law, conditions precedent are strongly disfavored. Indeed, Texas\n\nSupreme Court authority teaches that:\n\n                    In construing a contract, forfeiture by finding a condition precedent is to\n                    be avoided when another reasonable reading of the contract is possible.\n                    When the intent of the parties is doubtful or when a condition would\n                    impose an absurd or impossible result, the agreement will be interpreted as\n                    creating a covenant rather than a condition. Because of their harshness in\n                    operation, conditions are not favorites of the law.\n\nCriswell v.

(same).\n\n             Texas courts “resolve whether a contractual provision is a covenant or a condition\n\nprecedent by examining the entire contract to determine the parties’ intent.” Arbor Windsor\n\nCourt, Ltd. v. Weekley Homes, LP, 463 S.W.3d 131, 136 (Tex. App.—Houston (14th Dist.] 2015,\n\npet. denied) (emphasis added). That principle bears directly here, partly because the “entire\n\ncontract” includes the Joint Tariff Agreement incorporated into the COD Agreement.15 Notably,\n\nunlike Section 4.1 of the COD Agreement, in describing Enterprise’s exclusive-use commitment\n\nthe Joint Tariff Agreement does not use any “provided that” language and does not refer to\n\nProduct deliveries “transported … to the Connection Point.” Instead, the Joint Tariff expresses\n\nthat commitment as follows:\n\n                   [T]he shipper agrees to ship under the Joint Tariff all crude owned or\n                   controlled by it from an Origin Point through the Connection Point to a\n                   Destination Point.16\n\n             Further, the word “provided,” as used in Section 4.1 of the COD Agreement, is not a\n\nmagic word that invariably introduces or creates a condition precedent. Rather, such language’s\n\n“true office and its general purpose is” merely “make clear the meaning of that which has gone\n\nbefore.” Knight v. Chicago Corp., 188 S.W.2d 564, 567 (Tex. 1945). In short, it introduces a\n\nclarification.17 So then, if the words “provided, that” do not introduce conditions upon\n\n\n\n15\n   Under Texas law, all writings that pertain to the same transaction must be interpreted together and, to\nthe extent possible, consistently. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 811 (Tex. 2005).\n16\n     Ex. 1-C (emphasis added).\n17\n    See id.; see also Stanley v. Colt, 72 U.S. 119, 166 (1866) (“It is true that the word ‘proviso’ is an\nappropriate one to constitute a common law condition in a deed or will, but this is not the fixed and\ninvariable meaning attached to it by the law in these instruments. On the contrary, it gives way to the\nintent of the parties as gathered from an examination of the whole instrument, and has frequently been\nthus explained and applied as expressing simply a covenant or limitation in trust.”).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 30\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             SR102\n\fEnterprise’s obligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities (as Enterprise contends),\n\nwhat do they accomplish? The answer is simple.\n\n             First, the words following “provided, that” define and clarify the scope of the Eagle Ford\n\ntransportation business both parties intended to be included in the Enterprise transportation\n\ncommitment, which subparts A and B of Section 4.1 very broadly state but do not specifically\n\ndefine. The Court will note that neither subparts A and B, nor the defined terms embedded\n\ntherein, specifically tie the exclusive-use commitment to Eagle Ford crude, or to the specified\n\nOrigin Points, or to the Destination Points. Those gaps are filled—the intended scope of the\n\ncommitment is defined and clarified—by the words following “provided, that.”\n\n             Second, the words “transported … to the Connection Point” simply identify the specific\n\nlocation where Enterprise must deliver crude into Magellan’s distribution system in order to\n\nfulfill its commitment as defined. As the contract’s definition of “Connection Point” makes\n\nclear,18 delivery into Magellan’s system must occur at one of two points of connection with the\n\nMagellan valve located at Genoa Junction, as distinguished from any other location within the\n\nvast complex of the “Magellan Facilities” as defined in the agreement. Thus, the words\n\n“transported … to the Connection Point” constitute a covenant that in fulfilling its commitment\n\nEnterprise will deliver crude to the specified location (not somewhere else), not a “condition” on\n\nthe Enterprise commitment to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities. That is why\n\n“transported ... to the Connection Point” is included, and that is all it means.\n\n             In other words, the phrase “transported … to the Connection Point” is not surplus and\n\ndoes have meaning, but not the meaning Enterprise puts on it. In fact, Enterprise’s spin on that\n\nlanguage makes circular nonsense out of Section 4.1, as though it meant: “Shipper agrees to\n\n\n18\n     See Ex. 1-B at 2, Section 1.5.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 31\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          SR103\n\fexclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities only IF Shipper delivers Product to the Magellan\n\nFacilities,” as it must (at some location) in order to utilize the Magellan Facilities at all.\n\n             Enterprise’s take on Section 4.1’s “transported … to the Connection Point” language also\n\nviolates another canon of construction, to harmonize and give effect to all provisions of the\n\ncontract so that none will be rendered meaningless or superfluous.19 The first “Commitment\n\nException” set forth in Section 4.2 of the COD Agreement states that if Enterprise “requires\n\nmore capacity than Magellan has available,” then Enterprise “may utilize third party facilities to\n\ntransport such excess Product until such time that Magellan has capacity available.”20 If, as\n\nEnterprise claims, it had no binding obligation to deliver any crude to the Magellan Connection\n\nPoint, what would be the point of including such an exception? None.\n\n             Additionally, Magellan’s interpretation of the “to the Connection Point” language\n\npreserves the reality of Enterprise’s exclusive use commitment, whereas Enterprise’s\n\ninterpretation makes the commitment illusory, in violation of another time-honored rule of\n\nconstruction. See El Paso Field Servs. L.P., 389 S.W.3d at 805; Texas Gas Utilities Co. v.\n\nBarrett, 460 S.W.2d 409, 412 (Tex. 1970) (“A contract will be construed in favor of\n\nmutuality.”). Enterprise tries to paper over that problem, arguing that its interpretation of Section\n\n4.1 does not make its commitment illusory because Enterprise gave consideration by forfeiting a\n\nright to use third party facilities which, like Magellan’s, have connection points at or near Genoa\n\nJunction. That is hogwash.\n\n             While it is true that Enterprise committed not to use such third parties’ facilities unless\n\nthe volume of Product in transport exceeded Magellan’s capacity to handle, that was not the\n\n\n\n19\n     El Paso Field Servs., L.P., 389 S.W.3d at 805.\n20\n     Ex. 1-B at 6, Section 4.2.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 32\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           SR104\n\fmaterial consideration for the deal. The material consideration Magellan bargained for (and got)\n\nwas Enterprise’s promise to exclusively use facilities owned by Magellan, instead of\n\nEnterprise’s own competing facilities at ECHO Terminal or elsewhere. That fundamental aspect\n\nof the bargain is plainly reflected in Section 4.2, which (in the exceptional circumstances\n\ndescribed) expressly allows Enterprise to use “third party” facilities but not its own. Enterprise\n\ncommitted Eagle Ford crude transportation business to Magellan, free from any interference by\n\nEnterprise or its affiliates, including any interference that might come from the ongoing\n\nexpansion of their facilities at the nearby ECHO Terminal.\n\n             In sum, Enterprise’s contention that Section 4.1 must be construed to “condition” its\n\ncommitment upon delivery of Product to the Magellan Connection Point—to mean, in effect,\n\nthat Enterprise will make exclusive use of Magellan’s distribution facilities only IF Enterprise\n\ndecides to deliver Product to the Connection Point with Magellan’s system—is clearly wrong\n\nand should be rejected.\n\n                    b) In any event, Enterprise cannot escape its transportation “commitment” by\n                       choosing not to transport Product “to the Connection Point”\n\n             It is hornbook contract law that a party whose obligation is conditioned upon the\n\noccurrence of an event within that party’s control cannot escape its obligation by purposely\n\ncausing the event not to occur.

Perillo et al., Corbin on Contracts § 5.28, at 149 (Rev. ed. 1995) (“The tendency of\n\nthe law is to avoid the finding that no contract arose due to an illusory promise when it appears\n\nthat the parties intended a contract.”). “When words are put in promissory form, courts are loath\n\nto give them an interpretation that makes them empty in fact and misleading to others.” Id. § 5.32\n\nat 179.\n\n             Thus, in arguing that it could (and did) purposely avoid using Magellan’s Facilities,\n\nEnterprise has admitted its violation of this basic rule of contract construction as well as its\n\nbreach of the implied duty to not prevent the occurrence of any so-called “condition” precedent\n\nto its performance. Without more, its Motion therefore fails.\n\n\n\n\n22\n    In an effort to excuse its deliberate failure to transport crude to the Magellan Connection Point,\nEnterprise argues that the COD Agreement is “a form of output/requirements contract.” Motion at 19.\nAlthough the COD Agreement is not an “output/requirements” contract, even if it could be viewed as\nsuch, that would not matter. Requirements contract are merely one type of agreement in which a party’s\nperformance obligation is subject to a condition within that party’s exclusive control. See Restatement\n(Second) of Contracts § 77 cmt d. The law discussed above equally applies to output/requirements\ncontracts. Indeed, the very case Enterprise relies on stands for the proposition that the law imposes on\nrequirements buyers an implied duty that prevents them from evading their contractual obligations by\nreducing their requirements.

That is also incorrect.\n\n                    a) Enterprise’s interpretation of the ownership/control requirement is not\n                       reasonable, much less the only reasonable interpretation\n\n             First and foremost, the COD Agreement has no “plain language” that unambiguously\n\nlimits the commitment to crude Enterprise owns or controls continuously from end-to-end of the\n\ntransport, from Origin Point to Destination Point. In fact, nothing in the contract expressly\n\nanswers the question: when or where must the Eagle Ford crude be owned or controlled by\n\nEnterprise in order for its Magellan transportation commitment to apply?\n\n             Subparts A and B of Section 4.1 state that the Enterprise commitment applies to “all\n\ndeliveries of Product that are Owned or Controlled by Shipper [or any Affiliate],” but they do not\n\ndirectly identify any particular time or place where Enterprise’s ownership or control must exist\n\nin order for its exclusive use commitment to apply. Nor is that matter specifically addressed in\n\nthe contract’s definitions of the terms “Owned” or “Controlled.” The term “Owned” is defined:\n\n                1.32 “Owned” shall mean Product to which Shipper or its Affiliate holds title;\n                provided, however, the custody of Product by an Affiliate of Shipper that is\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 37\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             SR109\n\f                transporting such Product for the account of a party or parties other than\n                Shipper or its Affiliates does not constitute being Owned.24\n\nThe definition of “Controlled” is substantially the same.25\n\n             However, when the language of the COD Agreement is examined in full and in context,\n\nall signs point to the Origin Point, strongly indicating that Enterprise’s ownership or control of\n\ncrude at any Eagle Ford Origin Point is sufficient to satisfy Section 4.1’s owned/controlled\n\nrequirement. Eagle Ford Origin Points are the central focus of the whole COD Agreement.\n\nFurther, the COD Agreement owes its very existence to crude oil transportation business\n\ncoming from Eagle Ford origins, and the contract revolves around crude Enterprise owns and\n\nmarkets from certain Eagle Ford Origin Points. What is more, subparts A and B of Section 4.1\n\ntie Enterprise’s commitment to “all deliveries of Product that are Owned or Controlled by\n\nShipper [or any Affiliate].” This clear and plain reference to “all” deliveries indicates that\n\nEnterprise’s ownership of Product at the Origin Point or at any time or place along the route\n\nbetween Origin Point and Destination Point is sufficient. Unlike the Enterprise interpretation,\n\nthis view harmonizes all provisions of the COD Agreement and is consistent with the mutual\n\nintent and purpose of the agreement— as Enterprise put it, “the intent of the agreement was for\n\nall of the marketing volume to move through these [Magellan] connections, and that is our\n\nintent….”26\n\n             Magellan submits that its interpretation of the ownership/control requirement is the only\n\nreasonable interpretation of Section 4.1 when construed in the manner required by well-\n\nestablished principles discussed above. Enterprise’s interpretation, on the other hand, is wholly\n\n\n24\n     Ex. 1-B at 2, Section 1.32.\n25\n     Ex. 1-B at 2, Section 1.6.\n26\n     Ex. 1-A.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 38\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR110\n\funreasonable because it would allow Enterprise to switch its commitment off or on at will. A\n\ncardinal rule of contract interpretation is to avoid, if possible, any such unreasonable\n\nconstruction of the language used. See Plains, 473 S.W.3d at 305.\n\n             At a minimum, Magellan’s interpretation is a reasonable construction consistent with the\n\ncircumstances under which the COD Agreement was made, the purpose for which it was made,\n\nthe contract as a whole, and the express language used in Section 4.1. This precludes summary\n\njudgment based on Enterprise’s argument that the COD Agreement unambiguously requires\n\nEnterprise to own or control its Eagle Ford crude continuously from end-to-end of the transport\n\nfrom an Origin Point to a Destination Point.\n\n                    b) Regardless, Enterprise cannot avoid its commitment by manipulating Product\n                       ownership/control downstream from an Origin Point\n\n             Just as delivery of Product to Magellan’s Connection Point is within the sole control of\n\nEnterprise, so is ownership or control of Product at all times and locations between an Origin\n\nPoint and a Connection Point into Magellan’s distribution system. Enterprise is not compelled by\n\nany law or regulation to sell its Eagle Ford crude after it leaves an Origin Point but before it\n\nreaches the Magellan Facilities. Instead, and as far as is currently known, pursuant to buy-sell\n\nagreements it made after executing the COD Agreement Enterprise is voluntarily reselling to a\n\ncustomer, at ECHO Terminal, the same volume of crude Enterprise purchases from the customer\n\nand thus owns at an Origin Point.\n\n             As discussed above, when a contracting party’s obligation is actually conditioned upon\n\nthe occurrence of an event or subject to a requirement within that party’s own control, the law\n\nprevents the party from avoiding its obligation by causing the condition or requirement not to be\n\nfulfilled. That principle applies to the contract requirement of Product ownership or control by\n\nEnterprise. The contract requirement is satisfied if Enterprise purchases and owns crude at an\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 39\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR111\n\fOrigin Point, and no subsequent transfer of ownership can defeat Enterprise’s transportation\n\ncommitment to Magellan.27\n\n             For all of these reasons, the no-evidence Motion for summary judgment on Magellan’s\n\nbreach of contract claim should be denied.\n\n     B.      ENTERPRISE IS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON MAGELLAN’S CONTRACT\n             REFORMATION CLAIM (SECOND CLAIM, IN THE ALTERNATIVE)\n\n             Enterprise next contends that Magellan’s reformation claim fails because Magellan\n\ncannot demonstrate the existence of a mutual mistake. In particular, Enterprise argues that\n\n“[e]vidence of mistake must be clear, exact and satisfactory” and that “Magellan cannot make\n\nthis showing.”\n\n             For Enterprise to make this argument, at this stage, is ironic. Enterprise filed the Motion\n\nless than two months into the case, and then moved to block all the discovery Magellan had\n\ncommenced. To then argue that Magellan has no evidence sufficient to prove its reformation\n\nclaim, as will be required at trial, takes “gumption” to say the least.\n\n             “A party should not be able to abuse the discovery process by withholding key evidence\n\nfrom a party opponent and then use that lack of evidence to win a judgment.” McInnis v. Mallia,\n\n261 S.W.3d 197, 204 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.). “Parties are entitled to\n\nfull, fair discovery and to have their cases decided on the merits.” Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo,\n\n279 S.W.3d 656, 663 (Tex. 2009). It is a clear abuse of discretion to terminate a party’s claim on\n\n27\n   Because it cannot point this Court to any contract provision which states that for crude to be subject to\nEnterprise’s transportation commitment it must be owned/controlled by Enterprise not only at an Origin\nPoint but all at all times and points along the transportation route to a Destination Point, Enterprise resorts\nto arguing that nothing in the contract expressly obligates Enterprise to “ensure that the crude oil remains\nowned by Enterprise or its affiliates at all stages of the transport.” Motion at 20 (emphasis added). That\nargument misses the point. Regardless of whether the COD Agreement requires Enterprise to maintain\nownership of Product all the way from Origin Point to a Connection Point with the Magellan Facilities, it\ndoes require Enterprise to ensure that the commitment to exclusively utilize Magellan’s facilities is\nhonored and fulfilled even if ownership of Product is transferred to another at some stage of the Product’s\ntransport from an Origin Point.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 40\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                  SR112\n\fthe merits, for lacking sufficient evidence, before any discovery has taken place. See id. That is\n\nprecisely what Enterprise is asking the Court to do here. The request should be denied.\n\n             But regardless of its obvious prematurity, Enterprise’s argument is meritless. Even\n\nwithout the benefit of any discovery, Magellan has presented sufficient evidence to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of fact regarding its reformation claim. “[R]eformation requires two elements: (1)\n\nan original agreement and (2) a mutual mistake, made after the original agreement, in reducing\n\nthe original agreement to writing.” Cherokee Water Co. v. Forderhause, 741 S.W.2d 377, 379\n\n(Tex. 1987). Magellan has offered ample evidence of both. Mark Daggett negotiated the COD\n\nAgreement on Magellan’s behalf. As Mr. Daggett explains in his affidavit, both parties\n\nexpressed, in writing, their understanding that Enterprise was agreeing to exclusively utilize the\n\nMagellan Facilities for all deliveries of Enterprise “marketing” volume of crude oil moving from\n\nthe Origin Points to the Destination Points. Thus, assuming the parties’ true agreement is not\n\nfaithfully embodied in Section 4.1 of the COD Agreement (and, again, it is), then Magellan has,\n\nat the very least, presented sufficient evidence that the COD Agreement, as written, is the result\n\nof a mutual mistake in reducing the parties’ actual agreement to writing. Summary judgment at\n\nthis stage is, therefore, both premature and entirely improper.\n\n   C.        ENTERPRISE IS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT                    ON   MAGELLAN’S\n             DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CLAIM (THIRD CLAIM)\n\n             Enterprise argues that Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim duplicates Magellan’s\n\nbreach of contract claim and, therefore, is not justiciable. That is incorrect. The declaratory\n\njudgment claim concerns more than Enterprise’s past breach of the COD Agreement; it also\n\nconcerns Enterprise’s legal obligation for future performance of the transportation commitment\n\nover the remaining four years of the COD Agreement’s term. Accordingly, the declaratory\n\njudgment claim is justiciable.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 41\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     SR113\n\f             Although declaratory relief “is not available to settle disputes already pending before\n\n[the] court,” this rule does not apply where the declaratory relief sought “has greater\n\nramifications than the original suit.” BHP Petroleum Co. Inc. v. Millard, 800 S.W.2d 838, 841–\n\n42 (Tex. 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). This most often occurs where, as here, “the\n\nrequested declaratory relief reaches beyond the pending suit to future events arising out of the\n\nongoing and continuing relationship between the parties.” Cont’l Homes of Texas, L.P. v. City of\n\nSan Antonio, 275 S.W.3d 9, 21 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2008, pet. denied). Thus, in a breach of\n\ncontract case, if the requested declaratory relief seeks “an interpretation of the … contract, which\n\nwould have the effect of defining the obligations of the parties under that contract for the\n\nforeseeable future,” then that relief is not barred or non-justiciable merely because of a pending\n\nbreach of contract claim seeking past damages.28 BHP Petroleum Co. Inc., 800 S.W.2d at 842;\n\naccord Indian Beach Prop. Owners’ Ass’n v. Linden, 222 S.W.3d 682, 702 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston 2007, no pet.).\n\n             In sum, the motion for summary judgment on Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim\n\nfails because the law permits Magellan to pursue a “monetary award … for past damages\n\nsuffered as a result of [the defendant’s] breach” and simultaneously obtain “declaratory [relief]\n\n… intended to prevent future damages.” Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v.

In all of them, the declaratory relief\nsought involved backward-looking relief, between parties with no ongoing contractual relationship. See\nClark v. Dillard’s, Inc., 460 S.W.3d 714, 727 (Tex.

ENTERPRISE IS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON MAGELLAN’S\n             PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL CLAIM (FOURTH CLAIM, IN THE ALTERNATIVE)\n\n             Enterprise contends that, as a matter of law, the parties’ written agreement bars\n\nMagellan’s Fourth Claim, its alternative claim for promissory estoppel. That is also incorrect.\n\n             Although “[p]romissory estoppel is not applicable to a promise covered by a valid\n\ncontract between the parties,” “promissory estoppel will apply to a promise outside a contract.”\n\nTrevino & Assocs. Mech., L.P. v. Frost Nat. Bank, 400 S.W.3d 139, 146 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2013, no pet.) (emphasis added). In other words, the existence of a written agreement does not\n\nbar a promissory estoppel claim if (1) the written agreement is invalid, or (2) the promise relied\n\non is not part of the parties’ written agreement. See id.; see also Transcon. Realty Inv’rs, Inc. v.\n\nJohn T. Lupton Tr., 286 S.W.3d 635, 648 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no. pet) (“If the elements of\n\npromissory … estoppel are met, then a promise may enforce an otherwise unenforceable\n\ncontract”); Harris Const. Co., LTD. v. GGP-Bridgeland, L.P., 698 F. Supp. 2d 723, 730 (S.D.\n\nTex. 2010) (holding that a party’s oral promise that “materials and work furnished under [a]\n\nContract would be of good quality, free from faults and defects and in conformance with the\n\nContract” was a “promise outside the parties’ contract” and thus enforceable by a promissory\n\nestoppel claim). For these reasons, promissory estoppel is often described as “a viable alternative\n\nto breach of contract.” Trevino, 400 S.W.3d at 146.\n\n             Here, Magellan has pled a promissory estoppel claim, in the alternative to its breach of\n\ncontract claim. Magellan’s promissory estoppel claim seeks to recover on the promise Enterprise\n\nmade to Magellan on October 18, 2011,29 that Enterprise would exclusively use the Magellan\n\nFacilities for all Origin Point-to-Destination Point deliveries of Enterprise’s “marketing”\n\nvolumes of crude oil—that is, crude Enterprise owns and markets from an Origin Point, as\n\n29\n     Ex. 1-A.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 43\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR115\n\fdistinguished from crude others own and merely transport in their own names and for their own\n\naccounts, on an Enterprise pipeline. Magellan believes that Enterprise’s promise is synonymous\n\nwith the Enterprise transportation commitment as expressed in Section 4.1 of the parties’ written\n\nagreement. However, if the Court should determine that Enterprise’s interpretation of Section 4.1\n\nof the COD Agreement is the only reasonable interpretation of its transportation “commitment”\n\nas expressed in the written contract (which it should not), then Magellan would have an\n\nactionable promissory estoppel claim based on Enterprise’s promise. This is so for at least two\n\nreasons.\n\n             First, under Enterprise’s construction of the Section 4.1, its promise would fall outside of\n\nthe parties’ written contract and thus provide a basis for an independent promissory estoppel\n\nclaim. See Harris Const. Co., LTD., 698 F. Supp. 2d at 730. Second, if Section 4.1 of the COD\n\nAgreement means what Enterprise says, then its exclusive-use commitment is illusory and\n\nunenforceable. Without a valid agreement, promissory estoppel provides an available remedy.\n\nSee Transcon. Realty Inv’rs, Inc., 286 S.W.3d at 648.\n\n             In other words, Enterprise cannot have it both ways. If the promise at issue is embodied\n\nin Section 4.1 of the COD Agreement (which it is), then Magellan is entitled to pursue and\n\nrecover damages under its breach of contract claim. If, on the other hand, the Court endorses the\n\nEnterprise interpretation of Section 4.1 as a matter of law, then Magellan has a viable claim for\n\npromissory estoppel.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 44\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            SR116\n\f     E.      ENTERPRISE IS NOT ENTITLED        TO   SUMMARY JUDGMENT        ON   MAGELLAN’S FRAUD\n             CLAIM (FIFTH CLAIM)\n\n             As Magellan alleged in its Original Petition,30 when it approved and signed the COD\n\nAgreement as written, Magellan accepted as true and relied upon various Enterprise\n\nmisrepresentations or material omissions including the following:\n\n                Enterprise’s representation that for all of its “marketing volume” of Eagle Ford crude\n                 oil—which Magellan understood to mean crude oil Enterprise would purchase from\n                 Eagle Ford customers and would have the legal right to transport from the Eagle Ford\n                 Shale to Houston-area destination points—Enterprise intended to use the Magellan\n                 Facilities and was legally binding itself to transport the crude through the Magellan\n                 Facilities.\n\n                Enterprise’s representation that by suggesting certain changes in the contract\n                 definitions of “Owned” and “Controlled,” Enterprise was not attempting to change\n                 the substance or effect of the parties’ actual agreement regarding Enterprise’s\n                 exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities.\n\n                Enterprise’s representation that the “transportation volumes”—the Eagle Ford crude\n                 being excluded from the scope of Enterprise’s transportation commitment to\n                 Magellan—were limited to customer-owned (not Enterprise-owned) crude that\n                 Enterprise Pipeline would be transporting from an Eagle Ford location to a final\n                 destination as directed by those customers pursuant to bona fide transportation\n                 agreements between the pipeline company and its customers.\n\n                The lack of any disclosure that, in fact, Enterprise was planning to replace existing\n                 marketing agreements with buy/sell agreements and claim that once the crude was\n                 resold to the marketing customer Enterprise’s commitment to make exclusive use of\n                 the Magellan Facilities no longer applied.\n\n             Magellan’s Original Petition also alleges that Enterprise’s misrepresentations or\n\nconcealments of material information continued after the parties signed the COD Agreement -\n\nmisleading Magellan to believe that Enterprise really intended to make exclusive use of the\n\nMagellan Facilities being developed at great cost, not that Enterprise viewed its “commitment”\n\n\n\n\n30\n     See Original Petition ¶¶ 30-35.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 45\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          SR117\n\fas nothing more than an option to use Magellan’s facilities if/when Enterprise chose not to use its\n\nown.31 Such conduct by Enterprise clearly supports Magellan’s claim of fraud.32\n\n             The no-evidence Motion does not challenge the admissibility or sufficiency of\n\nMagellan’s evidence in support of its fraud claim, and for good reason. The no-evidence Motion\n\nis premature, as Magellan has not had any discovery. The currently available evidence presented\n\nby Magellan is clearly admissible; the parol evidence rule does not apply to a fraud claim.33\n\nFinally, even if the Motion were not premature, Magellan’s burden would only be to present a\n\nscintilla of evidence which could support its fraud claim, giving Magellan the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences. Lightning Oil Co., 520 S.W.3d at 45.\n\n             Enterprise’s summary judgment argument rests on (i) an assumption that Enterprise’s\n\ninterpretation of the COD Agreement is correct as a matter of law, and (ii) an assertion that if the\n\nCourt agrees with Enterprise’s interpretation of the contract as written, Magellan’s reliance on\n\nEnterprise’s misrepresentations was unjustifiable as a matter of law, because Magellan must\n\nhave known it was being lied to. Neither of those is correct.\n\n\n\n\n31\n     See Original Petition ¶¶ 45-49.\n32\n    A claim for fraudulent inducement arises when a party is induced to enter into an agreement through\nfraud or misrepresentation. See Haase v. Glazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 798–99 (Tex. 2001). To prevail on a\nfraudulent inducement claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant knowingly made a false\nrepresentation, (2) intending to induce the plaintiff to enter into an agreement, and (3) that the plaintiff\nrelied on the misrepresentation to its detriment. See Hoffman v. L & M Arts, 838 F.3d 568, 576 (5th Cir.\n2016). In addition, “[a] contractual promise made with no intention of performing may give rise to an\naction for fraudulent inducement.” Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 304 (Tex.\n2006).\n33\n   See Santos v. Mid-Continent Refrigerator Co., 471 S.W.2d 568, 569 (Tex. 1971); In re Border Steel,\nInc., 229 S.W.3d 825, 835 n.12 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2007, orig. proceeding) (Despite the general rule\nthat extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to vary or add to the terms of an unambiguous agreement, such\n“evidence is admissible in cases where there are allegations of fraudulent inducement.”); Dallas Farm\nMach. Co. v. Reaves, 307 S.W.2d 233, 239 (Tex. 1957) (noting that the fraud exception to parol evidence\nrule applies even if the written contract contains a merger clause).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 46\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               SR118\n\f             First, for all the reasons discussed above, Enterprise’s construction of the COD\n\nAgreement is not the only reasonable construction, or even a reasonable construction. For this\n\nreason alone, the motion for summary judgment on Magellan’s fraud claim should be denied.\n\n             Second, even if the Court accepted Enterprise’s interpretation of the contract as written,\n\nthat would not defeat the fraud claim as a matter of law. In this regard, Enterprise cites various\n\ncases for the proposition that reliance on a misrepresentation is unjustified and unjustifiable if the\n\nmatter misrepresented “is directly contradicted by the express, unambiguous terms of a written\n\nagreement.” See, e.g., H2O Sols., Ltd. v. PM Realty Grp., LP, 438 S.W.3d 606, 624 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2014, pet. denied) (emphasis added). However, to defeat a claim of reliance\n\non fraudulent misrepresentation, Texas law requires direct contradiction in express terms. Id. at\n\n624–25.34 As the cases cited by Enterprise make clear, the mere fact that a court, upon applying\n\napplicable rules of contract interpretation, may determine a contract to be unambiguous, does not\n\nnecessarily mean that a party who relied on misrepresentations about the agreement must have\n\nknown they were misrepresentations. An agreement that lacks clarity may nonetheless be found\n\nto be technically “unambiguous.” See Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. Renaissance Women’s\n\nGrp., P.A., 121 S.W.3d 742, 746 (Tex. 2003) (“Lack of clarity does not create an ambiguity….”).\n\n\n\n34\n    All of the cases Enterprise cites satisfied this basic requirement and thus are readily distinguishable.\nSee, e.g., Nat’l Prop. Holdings, L.P. v. Westergren, 453 S.W.3d 419, 424 (Tex. 2015) (holding that a\nplaintiff’s reliance on the defendant’s oral promise to pay $1 million was unjustified because the contract\nexpressly limited total compensation to $500,000); H2O Sols., Ltd., 438 S.W.3d at 625 (“[A]ny alleged\nmisrepresentations concerning these issues [asserted by plaintiff] are contradicted by the express terms of\nthe contract … .”); Miller Glob. Properties, LLC v. Marriott Int’l, Inc., 418 S.W.3d 342, 348 (Tex.\nApp.—Dallas 2013, pet. denied) (holding that an investor’s reliance on the defendant’s oral\nrepresentations that plans for a resort were complete was unjustified because the schedules attached to the\nparties’ agreement clearly “demonstrated that the construction plans required extensive additions”); DRC\nParts & Accessories, L.L.C. v. VM Motori, S.P.A.,112 S.W.3d 854, 858 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2003, pet. denied) (holding that a retailer’s reliance on a manufacturer’s oral representation that the\ndistributor would have the “exclusive right” to sell the manufacturer’s product was unjustified where the\ncontract expressly stated that the retail’s right to distribute was “non-exclusive”).\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 47\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               SR119\n\fThis most often occurs when a provision is unclear on its face and yet, “after applying the\n\npertinent rules of contract interpretation,” can still be given a certain or definite meaning. Nassar\n\nv. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 508 S.W.3d 254, 258 (Tex. 2017). For this reason, to defeat a claim\n\nof reliance on a fraudulent misrepresentation, Texas law requires proof that the written contract\n\n“directly contradict[s]” the defendant’s oral misrepresentation in “express … terms.” H2O Sols.,\n\nLtd., 438 S.W.3d at 624 (emphasis added).\n\n             Here, whatever may be said for Enterprise’s interpretive arguments, the COD Agreement\n\ndoes not directly contradict Enterprise’s misrepresentations, in express terms. The contract does\n\ndirect or expressly state that Enterprise can defeat its exclusive-use obligation by transferring\n\ntitle to crude downstream from an Origin Point or by refusing to deliver crude oil to the\n\nMagellan Connection Point. Indeed, Enterprise’s argument is that the COD Agreement permits\n\nsuch things because it does not specifically or expressly prohibit them.35\n\n             Accordingly, the Motion for summary judgment on Magellan’s fraud claim should be\n\ndenied.\n\n     F.      BECAUSE THE MOTION IS PREMATURE IN ANY EVENT, IT COULD NOT BE GRANTED\n             BEFORE MAGELLAN HAS HAD ADEQUATE TIME TO CONDUCT RELEVANT DISCOVERY\n\n             The Enterprise Motion constitutes a no-evidence motion for summary judgment under\n\nRule 166a(i). See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). A no-evidence motion may be filed only “[a]fter\n\nadequate time for discovery.” Id. Magellan has had no discovery or opportunity for discovery, let\n\nalone the “adequate time for discovery” that Rule 166a(i) requires before a no-evidence motion\n\nfor summary judgment may be filed. Indeed, immediately after it filed the no-evidence Motion,\n\nEnterprise moved to stay any and all discovery by Magellan,36 thus ensuring that Magellan could\n\n\n35\n     Motion at 11, SOF ¶ 21.\n36\n     See Ex. 2-F.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 48\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR120\n\fnot have “adequate time for discovery” and compounding the impropriety of the premature no-\n\nevidence Motion. It is no answer to argue, as Enterprise has in its stay motion, that discovery is\n\n“premature” and “unnecessary” because the Court “need not and indeed cannot consider any\n\nextraneous evidence in determining the threshold legal issue raised in Enterprise’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment.”37 Enterprise has it backwards: what is premature is its no-evidence Motion,\n\nnot the discovery Enterprise has effectively blocked for the time being.38\n\n             By filing its no-evidence Motion at the virtual outset of the case, prior to any opportunity\n\nfor discovery by Magellan, Enterprise seeks to have the Court decide the whole case (all five\n\nclaims) against Magellan before Plaintiff’s case gets off the blocks—that is, before Magellan\n\n(and the Court) learn anything more about what the Enterprise personnel who actually negotiated\n\nthe contract with Magellan understood Enterprise’s “commitment” to mean and require; what\n\nEnterprise actually intended with respect to its future performance or non-performance; all the\n\nways and means Enterprise has used or is using to circumvent its commitment; the scope and\n\nmagnitude of Magellan’s damages, and other matters essential to prove Magellan’s claims at\n\ntrial.\n\n             Magellan is plainly entitled to discovery on its breach of contract claim. “Whether a\n\ncontract is ambiguous … must be decided by examining the contract as a whole in light of the\n\ncircumstances present when the contract was entered.” Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc., 352\n\nS.W.3d at 449–50 (emphasis added). Magellan has a right to discovery regarding all such\n\n\n37\n     Motion at 1.\n38\n   Ironically, Enterprise itself asserts and relies on many alleged facts that are far beyond the four corners\nof the COD Agreement, including facts relating to intent (or lack thereof), opportunity, motives for\nentering into the COD Agreement, Magellan’s alleged mindset in not objecting to certain of Enterprise’s\nactions, and the like. Apparently, Enterprise does not believe its own legal argument that the Court must\nwear blinders when it interprets the COD Agreement, examining the four corners of the document and\nnothing else.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 49\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                 SR121\n\fcircumstances, including evidence going to the parties’ respective intentions, purposes, and\n\nunderstandings of their agreement. The Court should reject Enterprise’s invitation to decide the\n\n“threshold legal issue” in a vacuum devoid of all discoverable evidence of such circumstances.\n\n             Moreover, even if the Court were persuaded that Enterprise’s interpretation of the\n\ncontract is the only reasonable one, that would not defeat Magellan’s claims for contract\n\nreformation, promissory estoppel, and/or fraud. Magellan would still be entitled to discovery\n\ninto, at a minimum, whether the contract resulted from a mutual mistake in reducing the parties’\n\nactual agreement to writing, what Enterprise’s own records show about the representations and\n\npromises it made to Magellan, and whether Enterprise had an intent not to perform when it\n\nentered into the contract or otherwise intentionally misled Magellan.39\n\n             For all the reasons discussed above, the Motion is misguided on all counts and should be\n\ndenied across the board, here and now. However, if the Court is inclined to believe that on some\n\nelement of a claim for which Magellan will have the burden of proof at trial, the evidence\n\ncurrently before the Court, along with all reasonable inferences favorable to Magellan, may not\n\nsupply the scintilla of evidence necessary to withstand a summary judgment motion, then\n\npursuant to Rule 166a(g) Magellan moves the Court to defer ruling and continue the Motion as\n\nneeded to give Magellan adequate time and opportunity to conduct discovery essential to\n\nresolution of the Motion.\n\n                                           VI.    CONCLUSION\n\n             For the reasons set forth above, the no-evidence Motion for summary judgment should be\n\ndenied in its entirety.\n\n\n39\n   If, despite the representations Enterprise made to Magellan when the COD Agreement was executed,\nEnterprise intended all along to ensure that any purported “conditions” on its commitment never occurred,\nthen Enterprise both breached its agreement and committed fraud.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 50\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            SR122\n\f                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                             GABLEGOTWALS\n\n                                      By:    /s/ David L.

We would like to\nrevise the definition of \"Control\" to eliminate the clauseon legalauthorization to transport. Our\naffiliate. Enterprise Crude Oil Pipeline will be transporting crude for 3,d parties under transportation\nagreement rather than a marketing agreement so only the 3,d party will have authority to determine the\nultimate destination.\n\n\nI believe the intent of the agreement was for all of the marketing volume to move through these\nconnections and that is our intent, but as soon as a 3'dparty requests a delivery outside of this\nagreement, we don't want to be in default. Please let me know if you disagree with our interpretation.\n\nOur legal folks are revising the statement and I'llforward to you, if that is acceptable.

Slower rates into an\n               ENTERPRISE Connection Facilities shall be accommodated solely at\n               ENTERPRISE's discretion. Notwithstanding the above, any deliveries\n               received into the MPL Connection Facilities in Genoa Junction destined for\n               delivery to Anahuac Junction must meet the flow rates as specified in it)\n               below for receipt through Genoa Junction.\n\n          ii) Flow rates for deUverie.~ from MPL to ENTERPRISE at Anahuac Junction\n              shall be no less than 8000 barrels per hour for the first full 12 calendar\n              months of operation and 10,700 barrels per hour thereafter. Slower flow\n              rates shall be accommodated solely at MPL's discretion.\n\n         iii) For the purposes of establishing minimum flow rate requirements, the\n               Parties will use the parameters of West Texas Intennediate crude oil,\n               specifically, an API gravity of 40 (forty) degrees and a viscosity of 10 (ten)\n               ccntistokes at 68 (sixty-eight) degrees Fahrenheit. As the API gravity and\n               viscosity change, these minimum capacity requirements will be adjusted\n               accordingly in a manner agreed upon by the Parties, i.e., as the API gravity\n               decreases and viscosity increases, the minimum flow rate requirement will\n               be reduced. For example, both ENTERPRISE and MPL must have the\n               capability to deliver andlor receive crude oil of API gravity of 40 (forty)\n               degrees and a viscosity of 10 (ten) centistokes at 68 (sixty-eight) degrees\n               Fahrenheit through Genoa Junction at the now tates described above in i).\n\n8.

Common carriers specified in this section shall be referred to as ''pipelines,\" and the owners or\nshippers of crude petroleum by pipelines shall be referred to as \"shippers.'·\n\n     (1)     All marketable on to be received for traosportadon. By the tenn \"marketable oil\" is meant any crude\npetroleum adapted for refining or fuel purposes, properly settled and containing not more than 1.0% of basic sediment,\nwater, or other impurities above a point six inches below the pipeline connection with the tank: Pipelines shalJ receive for\ntransportation all such \"marketable oil\" tendered; but no pipeline shall be required to receive for shipment from anyone\nperson an amount exceeding 3.000 balTels of petroleum in any une day; and, if th~ uil It=Jul~ed for ttan~1X>natjon differs\nmaterially in character from that usualJy produced jn the field and being transported therefrom by the pipe1in~ then it shall\nbc transported under such terms as the shipper and the owner of the pipeline may agree or the commission may require .\n     • T/';.~ deviates from TAe Rule § 3.71, pQrogrDph (1) in thaI the limit/or basic: sedimellt. water. and olher impurities is\n      1.0 % rather thail 2.0% as provided in lire rule.\n\n      (2)    Basic sediment, bow determined-temperature. In determining the amount of sediment, water, or other\nimpurities, a pipeline is authorized to make a test of the oil offered for transportation from an average sample from each\nsuch tank, by the use of centrifugal machine, or by the use of any other appliance agreed upon by the pipeline llJ1d the\nshipper. The same method of ascertaining the amount of the sediment, water, or other impurities sllall be used in the\ndelivery as in the receipt of oil. A pipeline shall not be required to receive for transportation, nor shall consignee be\nrequired to accept as a delivCT)', any oil of a higher tempcr.!turc than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, except that during the summer\noil shall be received at any atmospheric temperature, and may be delivered at like temperature. Consignee shall have the\nsame right to lest the oil upon delivery at destination that the pipeline has to test before receiving from the shipper.\n\n     (3) \"Barrel\" defined. For the purpose of these sections, a \"barrel\" of crude petroleum is declared to be 42 gallons\nof 231 cubic inches per gallon at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n      (4) Oil involved in litigation, etc.-indemnity against loss. When any oil offered for transponation is involved in\nlitigation, or the ownership is in dispute, or when the oil appears to be encumbered by lien or charge of any kind, the\npipeiine may require of shippers an indemnity bond to protect it against all loss.\n\n     (5) Storage. Each pipeline shalJ provide, without additional ohargc, sufficient storage:, sueh as is incident and\nnecessary to the transportation of oil, including storage at destination or so near thereto as to be available for prompt\ndelivery to destination point, for five days from the date of order of delivery at destination.\n\n     (6) Identity of oil, maintenance of oil.

In fact,   it is    premature and improper\n\nunder Rule l66a(i) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and                                  is   otherwise unfounded for                  all   the\n\nreasons explained in Plaintiffs Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for                                                         Summary\n\nJudgment, which Magellan hereby adopts and incorporates                                       in opposition to the                Stay Motion.\n\nFurther, the Stay           Motion    is   meritless for other reasons, and Enterprise has not                              met    its   burden to\n\nshow         entitlement to the relief       it   requests.

As    the party\n\nseeking a protective order under Rule 192.6, Enterprise bears the burden of proof. See,                                        e.g.,\n\n\nEstate of Pollack          v.

A\n                                                                person is required to produce a\n                      document or tangible thing that is within the person's possession, custody,\n                      or control.\n\nId.

Stay Motion\n\nat 8-12.      Indeed, Enterprise’s entire argument about overbreadth and burden                        is   premised on the\n\nvery same assertion        made     in its   Motion   for    Summary Judgment, that the COD Agreement allows\n\nEnterprise to deliberately circumvent                 its   commitment       to    make   exclusive use of the Magellan\n\nFacilities,     and thus   that    Magellan has no               right to discover the particulars about Enterprise’s\n\n\ncircumvention schemes or the extent of the resulting damages to Magellan. That                                      is   clearly\n\n\nwrong, for       all   the reasons explained in MageIlan’s response in opposition to the Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.\n\n             Neither are Magellan’s discovery requests improperly duplicative, as Enterprise says.\n\nStay Motion at 13. While the non-parties                         may have some        responsive documents identical to\n\nresponsive documents in Enterprise’s possession, that                        is far   from a   certainty, especially since\n\n\nsome requested documents              date back a           number of     years,    and since Enterprise has previously\n\nrepresented to Magellan (in connection with Magellan’s audits) that Enterprise no longer has\n\ncertain important        documents such as        all       of the original Eagle Ford marketing agreements with\n\nthe non-parties currently          known to Magellan. Moreover, no                  case cited by Enterprise supports the\n\nproposition that a subpoena to non-party                    is   subject to being quashed merely because there              is   a\n\n\n\n\nPLAlNT|FF’S RESP.

Stay Motion               at 8. In the first place,\n\n\nEnterprise’s    argument that any “parol evidence”                will   be inadmissible at        trial is incorrect,    as\n\nshown by     the authorities cited in Magellan’s Response in Opposition to Defendant’s                        Motion     for\n\n\nSummary Judgment,           at   pages 22 and 45-46. Secondly, for discovery purposes the                     test is    not\n\nwhether the information will be admissible               at trial but   whether   it is   relevant to the subject matter\n\nof the action. See Rule l92.3(a) and              (b) (“It is not a     ground for objection that the information\n\nsought will be inadmissible at            trial if   the infonnation sought appears reasonably calculated to\n\nlead to the discovery of admissible evidence.). In this regard, Enterpn'se’s                           heavy reliance on\n\nNat’! Union Fire Ins. Co.          v.   CB1 Industries, 907 S.W.2d 517            (Tex. 1995)     is   misplaced. In that\n\ncase,   which involved only a claim            for breach of contract, the court held that         no further discovery\n\nof parol evidence was appropriate because the insurance contract provision                                 at issue     was\n\n\n\n\nPLAlNTlFF’S RESP.

Id. at   521 (Tex. 1995).         CB] Industries   is   readily distinguishable\n\nand inapplicable here, for several reasons.         5\n\n\n\nIII.       ENTERPRISE HAS        No LEGITIMATE “TRADE SECRETS” OBJECTION To ANY or\n           MAG!-3LLAN’S DISCOVERY REQUESTS\n\n           Enterprise also argues that a protective order       is   warranted on the ground that “[t]he vast\n\nmajority of Mage1lan’s requests seek information about Enterprise’s business operations and\n\nstrategies in the     Gulf coast region” and            that “[t]his information constitutes trade secrets\n\n\nbelonging to Enterprise.” Stay Motion           at 10. That, too, is     completely false and unsupported.\n\n           Without pointing the Court to any particular requests made by Magellan, Enterprise\n\noffers only a    sweeping conclusion     that “[i]n their totality, the requests          would require Enterprise\n\nto disclose its entire distribution    network and pricing          structure,   and lay open        all   of its customer\n\narrangements in the region.” Stay Motion            at 10.   That   is   sheer nonsense.       Any   close examination\n\nof Magellan’s actual requests shows         that they are carefully tailored         and reasonably conﬁned             to\n\n\ninformation plainly relevant to the subject matter of the action, the speciﬁc claims alleged, and/or\n\n\n°\n    First, the language    of the  COD   Agreement does not unambiguously favor Enterprise’s position.\nSecond,    unlike CB1 Industries, Magellan’s discovery requests seek evidence concerning the\ncircumstances surrounding the parties’ negotiation and entry into the              COD\n                                                                                  Agreement——evidence the\nCourt can and should consider in construing the          CODAgreement, notwithstanding the parol evidence\nrule. See First Bank v. Brumitl, No. 15-0844, 2017        WL1968830, at *l0 (Tex. May 12, 2017); Banker v.\nBreawc, 128 S.W.2d 23, 24 (Tex. 1939) (contracting parties’ intention must be ascertained from their\nagreement “in the light of the attending circumstances”); Basic Capital Management v. Dynex\nCommercial, 348 S.W.3d 894, 899 (Tex. 2011) (for contract interpretation, a court may consider “the\nundisputed evidence regarding [the contract’s] negotiation and purpose”); Sun Oil Co. (Del.) v. Madeley,\n626 S.W.2d 726, 731 (Tex. 1981) (even when a court concludes that the parties’ contract is unambiguous,\nit may consider the surrounding “facts and circumstances” as an “aid in the construction of the contract’s\n\nlanguage”). Third, in CB] Industries the surrounding circumstance were fully developed, whereas here\n(due to the Stay Motion) they are not. See Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, 279 S.W.3d 656, 664 (Tex. 2009)\n(noting that discovery was unnecessary in CB! Industries because “the facts in [that case] were\nsufficiently developed and all the relevant infonnation was at hand”). Fourth, unlike the plaintiff in CB1\nIndustries, Magellan also alleges claims for contract refonnation, promissory estoppel, and fraud. For\npurposes of those claims, parol evidence is relevant and admissible regardless of any ambiguity in the\nwritten contract. See, e.g., ISG Slate Operations, Inc. v. Nat’! Heritage Ins. C0,, 234 S.W.3d 711, 719-20\n(Tex. App.—Eastland 2007, pet. denied); Probado Techs. Corp. v. Smarmet, Inc., No. CIV.A. C-09-349,\n2010   WL  2232831, at *6 (SD. Tex.

TO DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR PROTECFION AND TO STAY DISCOVERY - Page 3\n|mi3s4;)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                             SR348\n\finformation reasonably necessary to determine and quantify the damages Magellan has suffered\n\nas a result of Enterprise’s wrongful crude oil transportation schemes designed to avoid\n\nEnterprise’s legal obligation to “exclusively utilize” the Magellan Facilities in accordance with\n\nthe    COD         Agreement.7 Here, too, Enterprise’s argument hinges on                                        its   assertion that such\n\ninformation            is   not discoverable because the                  COD     Agreement permits Enterprise               to   engage   in\n\n\nsuch schemes, with impunity. Again, that                             is   wrong,     for all the reasons explained in          Magellan’s\n\nresponse to the Motion for                     Summary Judgment.\n\n               Furthermore, to the extent any of the documents sought by Magellan                                             may    reveal\n\ninformation Enterprise                      deems   “proprietary” or “trade secret,” that                 is   only because Enterprise\n\nentered into a contractual                     commitment which              inevitably involves such information.“ In Section\n\n4.4 of the        COD Agreement, Enterprise expressly granted Magellan the right to “audit Shipper’s\n[Enterprise’s] records necessary to vertﬁz Shipper ‘s                                compliance” with      its    contractual obligations\n\nas set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the contract.” Therefore, Enterprise has no valid basis for a\n\nprotective order blocking discovery of                         all   such records, regardless of whether they include any\n\ninformation Enterprise                      may reasonably consider to be proprietary                 or “trade secret.”\n\n               Indeed,       the        case      Enterprise         cites     for     its   “trade     secret”        argument,    In     re\n\nBridgestane/Firestone, Inc., 106 S.W.3d 730 (Tex. 2003),‘° actually supports Magel1an’s\n\nposition. In that case, the                   Texas Supreme Court observed: “Any analysis of the necessity of trade\n\nsecret information to a fair adjudication                        must begin by examining the relationship between the\n\n7\n     See Ex.     B at 6, Section 4.].\n8\n  Of course, insofar as any non-party may possess infonnation Enterprise shared with that non-party, the\ninfomiation cannot constitute an Enterprise “trade secret.” It is worth noting, too, that none of the non-\nparties Magellan has subpoenaed to date have objected to Magel|an’s requests on the ground that they\ninvade the non-party’s trade secrets (or on any other ground, for that matter).\n9\n     Ex.   B   at 7,   Section 4.4 (emphasis added).\n'°\n     See Stay Motion          at   I   1.\n\n\n\nPLAlNTlFF'S RESP. IN OPP.

In so noting, the Court                     relied   on a Delaware case which allowed\n\ndiscovery of the fonnula for Coca—Cola, “one of the best-kept trade secrets in the world,”\n\nbecause     it   was necessary       for the fair adjudication of the case. Id. In this case,                 it is   abundantly\n\nclear that Enterprise’s shipping records directly pertain to material elements of Magellan’s\n\nclaims and thus are discoverable, regardless of any proprietary nature of the records.\n\n           Under these circumstances, the mere                 fact that   some of Magel1an’s discovery requests may\n\nreach business information in which Enterprise has a valid “trade secret” interest, cannot warrant\n\nan order prohibiting Magellan’s discovery of such information, much                              less the blanket stay        of all\n\ndiscovery sought by Enterprise.                 Any     legitimate “trade secret” concerns are easily resolved\n\n\nthrough a confidentiality agreement/order containing appropriate limitations on the use of such\n\ninformation       (e.g., for     purposes of      this litigation only).        Although such agreement/orders are\n\ncommonplace            in   complex business      litigation like this, neither Enterprise                nor any subpoenaed\n\nnon-party        has        presented     any proposed confidentiality agreement/order                        for     Magellan’s\n\nconsideration. Instead,          and     ironically, Enterprise has effectively         blocked     all   Magellan discovery\n\npending a hearing on the Motion for                Summary Judgment,             the motion in      which Enterprise urges\n\nthe Court to dispose of            all   Magellan claims on the merits, before Magellan has any discovery\n\nwhatsoever, on the ground that Magellan has no evidence to support                         its   claims.\n\n                                                         CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons stated above, and              in   Magellan’s response to the Enterprise no-evidence\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment, the Court should deny the Stay Motion, deny the Motion                                                for\n\n\nSummary Judgment, and permit Magellan to proceed with the discovery to which                                   it   is entitled.\n\n\n\n\nPLAlNTlFF’S RESP.

In the event Magellan elects not to increase its Initial Incentive Magellan Rate\n         in any given year of the Term, Magellan reserves the right to increase its Initial\n         Incentive Magellan Rate in any subsequent year during the Term by the\n         allowable cumulative percentage increase foregone by Magellan in prior years.\n\n      C. In addition to and not subject to the limitations set forth above, in the event\n         Magellan is required by a change from the Law as it existed on the Effective\n         Date to: (i) make signiﬁcant improvements to all or any portion of the Magellan\n         Facilities or (ii) to incur signiﬁcant additional expenses for public safety,\n         pollution control or for any other reason with respect to the Magellan Facilities,\n         and the effect of the cost and expense thereof to Magellan is not reflected in the\n         Oil Pipeline Index, Magellan may increase the Initial Incentive Magellan Rate\n         to reflect the effect of such costs and expenses incurred by Magellan to comply\n         with such change in Law. Magellan shall notify Shipper, not less than ninety\n         (90) days prior to the implementation of any increase in the Initial Incentive\n         Magellan Rate under this Section 3.3(C), of the amount of such proposed\n         increase, the reason for such increase and the method of calculating such\n         increase. Shipper shall have the right to notify Magellan within thirty (30) days\n         after Shipper receives Magellan’s notice, of Shipper's decision not to pay such\n         increase. If Shipper fails to timely notify Magellan of its decision, then it shall\n         be deemed for purposes of this Agreement that Shipper accepts and approves\n         such increase. If Shipper notiﬁes Magellan that it will not accept such increase\n         then such increase shall be null and void, but Magellan shall have the right to\n         terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) days after Magellan receives\n         Shipper’s notice in which case neither Party shall have any further obligations\n         to the other Party hereunder except as to obligations already accrued.

DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS\n\n                    DEFENDANT'S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF\n                     MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n\n      Defendant Enterprise Crude Oil, LLC files its reply in support of its motion\n\nfor summary judgment, responding to the arguments made by Magellan Crude Oil\n\nPipeline Company, L.P., as follows:\n\n                                 INTRODUCTION\n\n      Despite Magellan's attempts to complicate this case and confuse the issues,\n\nthe case presents a straightforward question of contract construction. As explained\n\nin Enterprise's motion and in the sections below, the plain and unambiguous\n\nlanguage of the Distribution Agreement defeats Magellan's breach of contract claim\n\nas a matter of law, and Magellan's remaining claims also fail.\n\n                          ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.    Enterprise's traditional summary judgment motion should be\n      granted because the proper construction of the Distribution\n      Agreement disposes of the entire case.\n\n      Enterprise has filed a traditional summary judgment motion under Rule\n\n166a(c). Enterprise attached supporting evidence to its motion—most significantly\n\nthe subject contract—and invoked the standard for traditional summary judgment\n\nDefendant's Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment                   Pagei\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  SR367\n\fmotions.1 Enterprise’s motion does not invoke the no-evidence rule—Rule 166a(i)—\n\nand does not follow the procedures for no-evidence motions. Instead, Enterprise\n\nseeks an expeditious end to Magellan’s frivolous lawsuit via traditional summary\n\njudgment, which is particularly appropriate when the controversy can be resolved\n\nby the proper construction of an unambiguous contract.             See Lopez v. Munoz,\n\nHockema & Reed, L.L.P., 22 S.W.3d 616, 617-18 (Tex. 2000).\n\n          Like a diligent propagandist, Magellan repeats over and over and over that\n\nEnterprise’s motion is a “no-evidence” motion. It manifestly is not, and the Court\n\nshould see through Magellan’s transparent attempt to keep its lawsuit alive by\n\nclaiming that an adequate time for discovery has not elapsed.\n\nB.        Magellan’s breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law based on\n          the plain and unambiguous language of the Distribution Agreement.\n\n          1.         The language of the Distribution Agreement defeats Magellan’s\n                     breach of contract claim because it defines the limits of\n                     Enterprise’s obligation under this requirements contract.\n\n          This is a contract interpretation case. Although the parties agree on the\n\nrules of contract construction, Magellan turns those rules upside down and\n\nbackwards to twist the Distribution Agreement to state terms it manifestly does not\n\nstate. The starting point for the analysis is the actual language of the Distribution\n\nAgreement. And the actual language unequivocally defeats Magellan’s claims:\n\n          4.1   Transportation Commitment. Following the In-Service Date,\n          Shipper [Enterprise] agrees:\n\n                     A.     to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities for all\n                     deliveries of Product that are Owned or Controlled by\n                     Shipper; and\n\n1   Motion, at 13.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                          PAGE 2\n\n\n\n                                                                                              SR368\n\f                  B.    to use best efforts to cause Shipper’s Affiliates to\n                  exclusively use the Magellan Facilities for all deliveries of\n                  Product that are Owned or Controlled by any of its\n                  Affiliates;\n\n                provided, that such deliveries are made from an Origin Point\n          and are either:\n\n                          (i)     transported on the Eagle Ford Pipeline System\n                                  through Echo Terminal to the Connection Point\n                                  and delivered to any of the Destination Points, or\n\n                          (ii)    transported on the Eagle Ford Pipeline System to\n                                  the Connection Point and delivered to any of the\n                                  Destination Points2\n\nThat language is clear and unambiguous. The Distribution Agreement is a type of\n\nrequirements contract, in which Enterprise agreed to use the Magellan Facilities to\n\ntransport a subset of the crude oil coming out of the Eagle Ford Shale, i.e., those\n\nbarrels that met the requirements expressly set forth in Section 4.1. Magellan’s\n\nbreach of contract claim does not allege that Enterprise failed to utilize the\n\nMagellan Facilities for crude oil that met the requirements of Section 4.1. Instead,\n\nMagellan alleges that Enterprise breached the Distribution Agreement by not\n\npaying Magellan for crude oil that does not meet the requirements of Section 4.1.\n\nBecause Magellan’s claim is based upon an invalid interpretation of the contract, as\n\na matter of law Enterprise is entitled to judgment on that claim as a matter of law.\n\n          Magellan’s unsupported and unexplained effort to evade the clear language of\n\nthe Distribution Agreement, is wrong as a matter of law. As noted in a leading\n\ntreatise, “[i]n a requirements contract the quantity term is not fixed at the time of\n\ncontracting.        The parties agree that the quantity will be the buyer’s needs or\n\n2   Original Petition at Exhibit A, § 4.1 (emphasis added).\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                            PAGE 3\n\n\n\n                                                                                                SR369\n\frequirements of a specific commodity or service.” J. Perillo & H. Bender, CORBIN ON\n\nCONTRACTS, § 6.5, p. 240 (West 1995).      Here, the quantity of crude oil to be\n\ntransported on the Magellan Facilities is not fixed in the Distribution Agreement,\n\nand Magellan tacitly concedes this point, making no contrary argument in its\n\nresponse. Instead, the parties agreed that Enterprise’s crude oil shipments meeting\n\ncertain requirements would be transported on the Magellan Facilities. Therefore,\n\nthe Distribution Agreement necessarily is a requirements contract. Otherwise the\n\nDistribution Agreement would fail for indefiniteness. See, e.g., Cox, Inc. v. Humble\n\nOil & Refining Co., 16 S.W.2d 285, 286-87 (Tex. Com. App. 1929).\n\n      The reason Magellan fights so hard to deny that the Distribution Agreement\n\nis a requirements contract is because, with that understanding, the analysis is\n\nstraightforward. The purpose of a requirements contract is to give the buyer an\n\nassured source of supply over an extended period of time without obligating him to\n\npurchase a specified quantity, thus enabling him to meet the fluctuating needs of\n\nhis business. Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Imperial Professional Coatings, 599 F. Supp.\n\n436, 438 (E.D. Tenn. 1984). Accordingly, courts have generally permitted buyers to\n\ncut back or eliminate entirely their orders if there is a bona fide decrease in the\n\nbuyers’ needs. Tenn. Valley Auth., 599 F. Supp. at 439. It is generally held that a\n\nrequirements buyer does not undertake to establish or maintain any particular\n\nlevel of requirements. Lambert Corp. v. Evans, 575 F.2d 132, 138 (7th Cir. 1978).\n\nThe seller instead assumes the risk of all good faith variations in the buyer’s\n\nrequirements, even to the extent of a determination to liquidate or discontinue the\n\nbusiness. HML Corp. v. General Foods Corp., 365 F.2d 77, 81 (3rd Cir. 1966).\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                    PAGE 4\n\n\n\n                                                                                        SR370\n\f      Thus, the buyer under a requirements contract for the paint required for\n\nnuclear power plants did not breach the contract when it cancelled construction of\n\nthe plants and purchased no paint. Tenn. Valley Auth., 599 F. Supp. at 439-40.\n\nAnd, the buyer under a requirements contract for limestone to be used in a specific\n\nconstruction project did not breach the contract when the project was cancelled and\n\nit purchased no limestone. R.A. Weaver and Assoc., Inc. v. Asphalt Constr., Inc., 587\n\nF.2d 1315, 1321 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Put differently, “a promise to buy from another\n\nperson or company all of some commodity or service that the promisor may\n\nthereafter need or require in the promisor’s business is not a promise to have any\n\nrequirements.” CORBIN, § 6.5, pp. 247-48. To the contrary, “a requirements buyer\n\nis privileged not to buy.” Id.\n\n      Professor Corbin’s treatise on contract law provides the following illustration:\n\n             (1) S promises to sell on stated terms, and B promises to buy, all\n      the coal that may be used by certain vessels then owned by B. Here, B\n      is privileged to withdraw the vessels from service and buy no coal at\n      all. B is privileged, also, to install oil burning boilers or a gas engine,\n      and buy no coal. There must, however, be an honest business\n      judgment for the withdrawal or conversion. But no coal for their use\n      may be bought of anyone other than S. If the vessels use coal, it must\n      be coal purchased from S.\n\nCORBIN, § 6.5, p. 251; see also Angelica Uniform Group, Inc. v. Ponderosa Systems,\n\nInc., 636 F.2d 232 (8th Cir. 1980) (buyer under a requirements contract was entitled\n\nto order reduced quantities highly disproportionate to a stated estimate if the\n\nreductions were done in good faith).\n\n      Applied here, these principles preclude Magellan from prevailing on its\n\nclaims as a matter of law. Under the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise is entitled\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                         PAGE 5\n\n\n\n                                                                                             SR371\n\fto engage in all of the following actions without breaching the agreement: (i) to\n\naccept deliveries of crude at points other than the Origin Points; (ii) to ship crude to\n\ndestinations other than the Destination Points (e.g., other refineries or terminals);\n\n(iii) to ship crude from an Origin Point to a Destination Point without going through\n\nthe Connection Point; and (iv) to ship crude owned by its customers without taking\n\nownership or control of the crude itself.3 In each case, Enterprise is not subject to\n\nthe incentive tariff under the Distribution Agreement because it only obligates\n\nEnterprise to use the Magellan Facilities—and thus pay the incentive tariff—for\n\ncrude that Enterprise owns or controls and ships from an Origin Point to the\n\nConnection Point and delivers to a Destination Point.\n\n       2.      The plain language of Section 4.1 has meaning and does not\n               render the Distribution Agreement illusory.\n\n       That Enterprise has some control over the specifics of its requirements does\n\nnot render this requirements contract illusory as Magellan claims.\n\n       The promisor’s duty is conditional upon the existence of an objective\n       need for the commodity or service, and the promisor may have a\n       high degree of control over the happening of this condition, but\n       this does not render the promise illusory. It states a limitation upon\n       the promisor’s future liberty of action. The promisor no longer has an\n       unlimited option.\n\nCORBIN, § 6.5, pp. 249-50 (emphasis added).

Moreover, the\n\nlanguage of Section 4.2 is not inconsistent with the proper interpretation of Section 4.1. The\n“Magellan Facilities” are defined as specific pipelines running from the Connection Point to the\nDestination Points. Section 4.2 merely states that if Magellan’s pipelines are at capacity, Enterprise\ncan utilize a third party’s pipeline for ultimate delivery of the crude. It has nothing to do with\nECHO terminal, and does not preclude Enterprise from shipping crude to ECHO terminal. In fact,\nthe definition of “Connection Point” recognizes that Enterprise may ship crude to ECHO terminal.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                                   PAGE 6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR372\n\for as little oil from one supplier as it chose, did not render its contract to purchase\n\nits requirements for oil from that supplier illusory.

In\n\nNorthern Natural Gas Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 986 S.W.2d 603, 604-05 (Tex. 1998), a\n\npipeline company (Northern) agreed to deliver for processing all of the natural gas\n\nthat it purchased and received under specified gas purchase contracts to a gas\n\nprocessor for a period of twenty years.         After gas prices were deregulated,\n\nNorthern’s purchases of natural gas dropped dramatically, eventually to zero, as it\n\ncancelled or declined to renew the gas purchase contracts. Id. at 605. In affirming\n\nthe court of appeals’ judgment reversing judgment for the gas processor, the\n\nSupreme Court stated:\n\n      Northern was obligated to deliver for processing all gas that it bought\n      under the dedicated gas purchase contracts for twenty years, and as\n      long thereafter as purchases continued under those contracts, but\n      Northern was never obligated to perpetuate the gas purchase\n      contracts or to deliver any gas for processing if no gas was\n      purchased.\n\nId. at 606 (emphasis added).\n\n      Similarly, in Keyes Helium Co. v. Regency Gas Services, L.P., 393 S.W.3d 858,\n\n860-61 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.), a midstream company (Regency) entered\n\ninto a contract to sell to a helium processing company (Keyes) all crude helium\n\nproduced at Regency’s Lakin Plant for a period of twelve years.

In this case, as in Northern Natural Gas and Keyes Helium,\n\nEnterprise was never obligated to ship crude from an Origin Point to a Destination\n\nPoint only through the Connection Point, or to accept deliveries of crude solely at\n\nthe Origin Points. As expressly recognized by the Texas Supreme Court, the fact\n\nthat Enterprise had some control over its requirements does not render the contract\n\nillusory. 4   Northern Natural Gas, 986 S.W.2d at 607.               Magellan’s contrary\n\narguments have no basis in the Distribution Agreement or in the law.\n\n       3.     Magellan’s interpretation of the Distribution Agreement is\n              unreasonable.\n\n       Magellan argues that the Distribution Agreement is ambiguous because\n\nSection 4.1 is subject to another reasonable interpretation.              But Magellan’s\n\ninterpretation Magellan is as unreasonable as it is absurd because it ignores the\n\nlaw, flouts common sense, and distorts the plain language of the contract. There is\n\nsimply no language in the Distribution Agreement itself or law supporting\n\nMagellan’s argument that the agreement requires Enterprise to use the Magellan\n\nFacilities exclusively for all deliveries of crude that are owned or controlled by\n\nEnterprise or its affiliates. The requirements in Section 4.1 are not “covenants”\n\n4The fact that Enterprise has paid Magellan more than $8.2 million under the Distribution\nAgreement also defeats an argument that it is illusory.

If the parties had wanted to create such an exclusive\n\narrangement, they would have used far different language—language that lacked\n\nany of the multiple requirements and limitations of Section 4.1.\n\n      Although Magellan devotes considerable energy in one portion of its response\n\nto arguing that the limitations or requirements in Section 4.1 are not conditions\n\nprecedent, in another portion Magellan argues—inconsistently—that Section 4.1’s\n\nrequirements are conditions precedent and that Enterprise purportedly waived such\n\nconditions by not fulfilling them. Not so. Properly understood, these elements are\n\nthe limitations or requirements that define what portion of Enterprise’s shipments\n\nof crude oil will be transported on the Magellan Facilities. Such provisions are\n\nentirely common with requirements contracts—they cover some of the buyer’s\n\nrequirements, not all of the buyer’s requirements. See, e.g., Cox, Inc., 16 S.W.2d at\n\n287 (all gasoline to be used by the buyer in operating a specific filling station, as\n\nopposed to all gasoline purchased by the buyer); Texas Co. v. Pensacola Maritime\n\nCorp., 279 F. 19, 23-24 (5th Cir. 1922) (all oil to be supplied to ships in Pensacola\n\nduring a fixed period, as opposed to all oil required by the buyer); Pace Corp. v.\n\nJackson, 284 S.W.2d 340, 343-44 (Tex. 1955) (all cigarettes for the buyer’s business\n\nselling cigarettes in Kerr and Bandera Counties, as opposed to all cigarettes to be\n\nsold anywhere).\n\n      Whether labeled a condition precedent or a limitation, the result is the same:\n\n“provided, that” does not mean “shall exclusively.” The “provided, that” language\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                   PAGE 9\n\n\n\n                                                                                        SR375\n\finstead limits Enterprise’s commitment and does not impose additional—and\n\nsuperfluous—obligations on the part of Enterprise and its customers to exclusively\n\naccept crude at Origin Points, exclusively route crude to the Connection Point, or\n\nexclusively deliver crude to Destination Points. To have imposed those kinds of\n\nobligations, the Distribution Agreement would need to state that “Enterprise shall\n\nexclusively accept deliveries of crude at Origin Points,” 5 that “Enterprise shall\n\nexclusively route crude through the Connection Point,” or that “Enterprise shall\n\nexclusively deliver crude to Destination Points.” But it doesn’t say that. And any\n\ncontrary conclusion would render an additional requirement to route through the\n\nConnection Point to a Destination Point superfluous because the function of the\n\nMagellan Facilities is to connect the Connection Point (Genoa Junction) with the\n\nDestination Points. As such, Magellan’s interpretation must be rejected. See Coker\n\nv. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex. 1983).\n\n       Moreover, Magellan’s interpretation would require Enterprise to abandon its\n\nbusiness of transporting crude oil for its customers. It would require Enterprise to\n\nabandon any entry point on its Eagle Ford Pipeline system other than the four\n\nspecified Origin Points. It would require routing the entirety of the crude volume\n\ntransported by Enterprise through one point—Genoa Junction—regardless of the\n\nefficiencies or economics of that routing.             In short, Magellan’s argument would\n\n5 Magellan does not contend that Enterprise is obligated to only accept deliveries of all crude it\n\npurchases anywhere in the world at the Origin Points, but in so doing Magellan is being inconsistent\nin the application of what it terms “covenants,” highlighting that its interpretation is fallacious. The\nreferences to Origin Point, Connection Point, and Destination Points all come after the language\n“provided, that,” and according to Magellan’s logic all of those terms would be “covenants.”\nRequiring Enterprise to transport all crude that it buys anywhere in the world to an Origin Point\nwould be an obviously absurd result, as Magellan tacitly recognizes. That, however, is the direct\nconsequence of Magellan’s interpretation—mandating that Magellan’s interpretation be rejected.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                                    PAGE 10\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           SR376\n\frequire Enterprise to engage in an illegal boycott of all refineries and terminals in\n\nthe Houston-Galveston area other than the four specified Destination Points.\n\nEnterprise would never have bound itself to such an illegal exclusive dealing\n\narrangement.6\n\n          Finally, Magellan’s interpretation of the Distribution Agreement can be\n\ncorrect only if Northern Natural Gas and Keyes Helium are wrong. In Northern\n\nNatural Gas, the decisions to cancel and not renew the dedicated gas purchase\n\nagreements were within Northern’s control. Northern Natural Gas Co., 986 S.W.2d\n\nat 604-05. Under Magellan’s logic, however, Northern should have been obligated\n\nto keep those contracts in effect so that it would continue to buy gas it was obligated\n\nto send to Conoco for processing. That is not the law. The Texas Supreme Court\n\nflatly rejected Magellan’s position.   Id. at 606.   Likewise, in Keyes Helium, the\n\ndecision to close the Lakin Plant was within the control of Regency. Keyes Helium\n\nCo., 393 S.W.3d at 860-61. Therefore, according to Magellan, Regency should have\n\nbeen obligated to keep the plant open so that it would continue to supply helium to\n\nKeyes. The Dallas Court of Appeals rejected that position. Id. at 864. Magellan’s\n\ntheory and interpretation of the Distribution Agreement is therefore directly\n\ncontrary to controlling law, and must be rejected.\n\n          4.      Magellan’s interpretation would render          the   Distribution\n                  Agreement an illegal restraint on trade.\n\n          In an effort to manufacture ambiguity and create a fact issue, Magellan\n\ncontends that crude “Owned” or “Controlled” by Enterprise at any Origin Point, or\n\n\n6   See infra Section B.4.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                    PAGE 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                          SR377\n\fowned or controlled by Enterprise “at any time or place along the route between\n\nOrigin Point and Destination Point,” 7 must be transported on the Magellan\n\nFacilities. That is, Magellan argues that even if Enterprise sells the crude to a\n\nthird party at ECHO Terminal, or buys Eagle Ford crude at ECHO Terminal and\n\nthen sells it along the route, 8 Enterprise is required to compel its buyer to move\n\nthe crude through Magellan’s Genoa Junction and along the Magellan Facilities.9\n\nFurther, Enterprise’s affiliate, EPO, must refuse to do business with the buyer,\n\nbecause, according to Magellan, by entering into the Distribution Agreement\n\nEnterprise agreed to forego the use of “its own competing facilities” to transport the\n\ncrude.10\n\n       The problem is that such an agreement is per se unlawful. What Magellan\n\nposits as “the only reasonable interpretation of Section 4.1” is in practical effect an\n\nagreement among horizontal competitors to divide the transportation market for\n\ncrude produced in the Eagle Ford basin. Further, it is an agreement to induce or\n\ncoerce crude producers and purchasers to boycott all transportation facilities other\n\nthan the Magellan Facilities by conditioning an essential input–transport on\n\nEnterprise’s Eagle Ford Pipeline–on doing business with Magellan to the exclusion\n\nof all others. Such an agreement would be a naked restraint on trade and unlawful\n\n\n7 Magellan Resp. Br. at 41.\n8 This is itself a practical impossibility, further refuting Magellan’s interpretation. Crude is not\nsegregated at ECHO based on the crude’s origin; it is aggregated there based on quality with crude\nfrom various sources, and there is no way to determine whether any particular batch of crude\npurchased at ECHO was produced from an Origin Point.\n9 Notably, Magellan’s position in this regard is directly contrary to the plain language of Section 4.1\n\nof the Distribution Agreement stating that Enterprise shall use its “best efforts” to cause its\ncustomers to use the Magellan Facilities. It does not say Enterprise shall compel or require its\ncustomers to do so. See Original Petition, Ex. A, § 4.1.\n10 Magellan Resp.

Moreover, it places this Court in the position of having to\n\nenforce an unlawful, anticompetitive arrangement. See Cayan v.

Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983). The Texas Supreme Court\n\nhas made clear that courts are to give effect to the intention of the parties as is\n\napparent in an unambiguous writing. City of Pinehurst v. Spooner Addition Water\n\nCo., 432 S.W.2d 515, 518 (Tex.1968).                  Only if the intention of the parties as\n\nexpressed on the face of the document is doubtful may the court resort to parol\n\nevidence to resolve the doubt. Miller v. Miller,700 S.W.2d 941, 951 (Tex.

Where the meaning of the contract is\n\nplain and unambiguous, a party's construction is immaterial.”). Accordingly, this\n\nCourt may not permissibly, as Magellan suggests, consider the affidavit or the\n\nemail in determining whether an ambiguity exists. Instead, this Court must first\n\ndetermine as a matter of law based on the four corners of the Distribution\n\nAgreement itself, whether an ambiguity exists. And it must do so without\n\nconsideration of the evidence Magellan has offered.\n\n          Because Magellan knows these basic rules of contract construction prohibit\n\nthe Court from considering its evidence, Magellan characterizes its parol evidence\n\nas merely evidence of the “circumstances present when the contract was entered.”13\n\nThe cases Magellan cites in support of this proposition, however, do not support its\n\n13   Magellan’s Resp.

For example, in Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l v.

Then the court did precisely what this Court should do here—it first\n\nfocused solely on the language of the agreement itself. Id. at 452. In doing so, it\n\nconcluded that the contract at issue was not ambiguous and that consequently, the\n\nextrinsic evidence the trial court considered in error was “of limited relevance” and\n\n“[could not] be used to show the parties’ motives or intentions apart from the [ ]\n\nAgreement.” Id.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court reached a similar result in First Bank v. Brum,\n\nalso cited by Magellan. 519 S.W.3d 95 (Tex. 2017). In that case, the court similarly\n\nconstrued the language of the contract at issue, determined that it was not\n\nambiguous, and therefore concluded that the trial court erred in (1) submitting the\n\nissue to the jury at all; and (2) instructing the jury that it could consider extrinsic\n\nevidence to add an unwritten term to an unambiguous written agreement. Id. at\n\n106 (holding that “when a written contract is unambiguous . . . extrinsic evidence is\n\nsimply irrelevant and inadmissible on that issue. In such a case, the trial court can\n\nneither submit the issue to a jury nor rely on extrinsic evidence to add terms to the\n\nparties’ unambiguous agreement.”). The Court in First Bank did not stop there,\n\nhowever. It further clarified its holding in Basic Capital Management v.

Accordingly, it is inadmissible parol evidence by any Texas\n\nSupreme Court standard and it would be reversible error for this Court to consider\n\nit.\n\n          6.      Contrary to Magellan’s argument, the letter agreement relating\n                  to the Joint Tariff does not amend or alter the Distribution\n                  Agreement.\n\n          Magellan’s attempt to change the meaning of the Distribution Agreement by\n\nwhat it refers to as the “Joint Tariff Agreement” is disingenuous and baseless.\n\nMagellan falsely claims that the “Joint Tariff Agreement” expresses Enterprise’s\n\ncommitment and quotes a portion of that letter agreement. The full quote makes\n\nclear that the “shipper” referenced in the Joint Tariff Agreement refers to third-\n\nparty shippers—not Enterprise:\n\n          Magellan and Enterprise agree to offer an incentive program under the\n          Joint Tariff to shippers that enter into a ten (10) year agreement with\n          Magellan pursuant to which the shipper agrees to ship under the Joint\n          Tariff all crude oil owned or controlled by it from an Origin Point\n          through the Connection Point and to a Destination Point. The Joint\n          Tariff rate under the incentive program will be equal to or less than\n          the sum of the Enterprise local tariff and the Initial Incentive\n          Magellan Rate (as hereinafter defined).17\n\nMoreover, it identifies Enterprise as a “Participating Carrier,” not as a “shipper.”\n\nThe letter agreement refers to an incentive program under which Magellan and\n\nEnterprise are the carriers and contemplates separate agreements with third party\n\nshippers. It does not purport to restate, modify, or amend Enterprise’s obligation\n\n16   Magellan’s Resp. Br., Ex. 1 at ¶ 9,11.\n17   Magellan’s Resp.

Indeed, it does not reference or mention the\n\nDistribution Agreement at all. Instead, the letter agreement expressly states that\n\nits purpose is to confirm an agreement to establish a joint tariff. The Joint Tariff\n\nitself does not purport to require anyone, let alone Enterprise, to transport crude\n\non any particular routing.18 Rather, it merely sets forth the rates that will be\n\navailable to third party shippers who qualify as a “Participating Shipper.”\n\nMagellan’s argument is baseless.\n\nC.        Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim fails along with its breach of\n          contract claim and also fails because it is merely duplicative of its\n          breach of contract claim.\n\n          Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim is based on the same flawed\n\ninterpretation of the Distribution Agreement that underlies its breach of contract\n\nclaim. Because Magellan’s interpretation is wrong as a matter of law, not only does\n\nits breach of contract claim fail, but also its declaratory judgment claim necessarily\n\nfails for the same reasons.\n\n          Additionally, Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim is not justiciable\n\nbecause the issues sought to be resolved are already pending in this suit via\n\nMagellan’s breach of contract claim. See Clark v. Dillard’s, Inc., 460 S.W.3d 714,\n\n726 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2015, no pet.); Hydroscience Techs., Inc. v. Hydroscience,\n\nInc., 401 S.W.3d 783, 801 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, pet denied). Accordingly, the\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim should be dismissed for this reason as well.\n\n          Magellan’s cases do not support a different result. In BHP Petroleum Co. Inc.\n\nv. Millard, 800 S.W.2d 838, 842 (Tex. 1990), the Court considered whether a\n\n18   Magellan’s Resp.

Continental Homes of Texas, L.P. v. City of San Antonio, 275\n\nS.W.3d 9, 21 (Tex.

Indian Beach Property Owners’ Ass’n v. Linden, 222 S.W.3d\n\n682 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.) similarly involved a defensive\n\ncounterclaim that raised issues beyond the plaintiff’s claims. Halliburton Energy\n\nServices, Inc. v. Axis Techs., LLC, 444 S.W.3d 251, 262-63 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014,\n\nno pet.) involved a declaratory judgment over ownership of materials that remained\n\nunresolved after a breach of contract claim was decided, and the defendants’\n\nargument was that this was a “double recovery,” not that it was non-justiciable.\n\nD.        Magellan’s promissory estoppel claim is precluded by the express\n          contract between the parties.\n\n          Enterprise is entitled to summary judgment regarding Magellan’s promissory\n\nestoppel claim because under Texas law promissory estoppel is not applicable to a\n\npromise covered by a valid contract between the parties. Richter v. Wagner Oil Co.,\n\n90 S.W.3d 890, 899 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.).

Doctors Hosp. 1997, LP v. Sambuca\n\nHouston, L.P., 154 S.W.3d 634, 636 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.).\n\n       The Petition is devoid of any allegation that the Distribution Agreement is\n\nunenforceable for any reason. The problem with Magellan’s theory of pleading its\n\npromissory estoppel claim asserted in the alternative is that promissory estoppel\n\ndoes not apply as a matter of law when a valid contract governs the subject matter\n\nof the promise. Enterprise does not dispute the validity and enforceability of the\n\nparties’ Agreement and Magellan has sued to enforce it. 23             Indeed, Magellan\n\nexpressly relies on the Distribution Agreement in asserting claims for breach of\n\n20 Original Petition, ¶¶ 70, 71.\n21 Magellan Resp.

The Distribution Agreement clearly delineates,\n\namong other things, the scope of services provided, the parties’ obligations, and the\n\npotential liability for breach.24 Further, it contains an integration clause which\n\nprovides that the agreement’s terms are the final expression of the parties’ intent,\n\nand supersedes prior agreements. 25 Magellan has not—and cannot—provide a\n\nplausible argument why the Distribution Agreement is not enforceable. For that\n\nreason, Magellan has not stated a valid promissory estoppel claim, and summary\n\njudgment is appropriate. Birenbaum v. Option Care, Inc., 931 S.W.2d 497 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 1997, pet. denied); Trevino & Assocs. Mech., L.P. v. Frost Nat. Bank,\n\n400 S.W.3d 139 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.).\n\n          Magellan’s cause of action for promissory estoppel also fails as a matter of\n\nlaw because it is predicated on an alleged promise it claims is contained in the\n\nDistribution Agreement. Fertic v. Spencer, 247 S.W.3d 242, 250 (Tex. App.—El\n\nPaso 2007, pet. denied); see Subaru, Inc. v. David McDavid Nissan, Inc., 84 S.W.3d\n\n212, 226 (Tex. 2002) (promissory-estoppel action presumes there is no contract). In\n\nother words, since the alleged promise is part of a valid contract, Magellan cannot\n\ndisregard the contract and sue for reliance damages under the doctrine of\n\npromissory estoppel.

Id. Magellan\n\ndoes not and cannot make that allegation because the alleged promise falls squarely\n\nwithin the scope of Section 4.1 of the Distribution Agreement as Magellan readily\n\nconcedes in its response.\n\nE.     Magellan cannot demonstrate a mutual mistake that would justify\n       reformation of the Distribution Agreement.\n\n       Magellan cannot maintain its reformation claim, as illustrated by one of the\n\ncases Magellan itself cites. In Cherokee Water Co. v. Forderhause, 741 S.W.2d 377,\n\n381 (Tex. 1987), the Texas Supreme Court reversed a judgment granting\n\nreformation of a deed and rendered judgment for the defendant, recognizing that a\n\nmutual mistake as to the legal effect of language used in a writing, as opposed to a\n\nmutual mistake in reducing a prior agreement to writing, will not support\n\nreformation.     741 S.W.2d at 379-80.         At most, Magellan’s evidence is that its\n\nemployee, Mark Daggett, and Enterprise’s employee, Jake Everett,26 were mistaken\n\nabout the legal effect of the language used in the Distribution Agreement. That is\n\ninsufficient for reformation.\n\n       Reformation requires two elements.            First, the party seeking reformation\n\nmust prove the true agreement of the parties—it is not enough to show that both\n\nparties were mistaken about some feature of their bargain.                    National Resort\n\nCommunities v. Cain, 526 S.W.2d 510, 513 (Tex. 1975). Second, the party must\n\nshow that the provision erroneously written, included, or omitted in the written\n\n\n\n26Magellan has not shown that Everett was a decision-maker for Enterprise (and he did not sign the\nDistribution Agreement) or that Everett’s subjective belief about the Distribution Agreement was\nshared by persons with authority to bind Enterprise.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                              PAGE 23\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     SR389\n\fagreement was there by mutual mistake—it is not enough that the writing differed\n\nfrom the oral agreement. Id. at 513-14. Magellan falls far short of making either\n\nshowing.\n\n      Additionally, the Everett email and the alleged conversations between\n\nEverett and Daggett are in the nature of the back-and-forth characteristic of any\n\nnegotiation process.   They do not constitute evidence of a final agreement or\n\nevidence that the Distribution Agreement did not reflect the final agreement of the\n\nparties. See, e.g., Capitol Rod & Gun Club v. Lower Colorado River Auth., 622\n\nS.W.2d 887, 893 (Tex. App.—Austin 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Magellan has failed to\n\nshow that it has a valid reformation claim.\n\nF.    The express language of the Distribution Agreement bars justifiable\n      reliance, which precludes Magellan from maintaining a fraud claim.\n\n      Magellan makes three primary arguments in an effort to salvage its fraud\n\nclaim, none of which is availing. First, Magellan contends (again) that Enterprise\n\nfiled a “no-evidence” motion for summary judgment, which can be defeated through\n\npresentation of merely a scintilla of evidence.    For the reasons noted above in\n\nSection A, this is incorrect. Enterprise has moved under Rule 166a(c), because the\n\nterms of the Distribution Agreement affirmatively disprove the element of\n\njustifiable reliance. Second, Magellan asserts that Enterprise’s interpretation of the\n\nDistribution Agreement is unreasonable. As detailed in Enterprise’s motion and in\n\nthis reply, a review of the plain and unambiguous language of the agreement proves\n\notherwise.   And, third, Enterprise claims that the terms of the Distribution\n\nAgreement do not disprove reliance because the agreement’s language does not\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                   PAGE 24\n\n\n\n                                                                                         SR390\n\fdirectly contradict the alleged representation that all of Enterprise’s marketing\n\nvolumes would move through Magellan’s facilities.         For the reasons below, that\n\nargument likewise fails.\n\n      As an initial matter, the statement Magellan claims to have relied upon, that\n\n“all marketing volumes” would be subject to the Distribution Agreement, is plainly\n\nnot true under either party’s reading of the agreement. Even Magellan recognizes\n\nthat the subset of crude subject to the Distribution Agreement is defined and\n\nlimited by the terms of Section 4.1.      For this reason alone, Magellan’s alleged\n\nreliance on such a statement is unreasonable and therefore unjustified. Indeed, this\n\nwould be true even if the statement were “all marketing volumes originating from\n\nthe Origin Points” (it was not), because crude arriving at places other than the\n\nDestination Points are unambiguously excluded. In this respect, then, Section 4.1—\n\neven as interpreted by Magellan—directly contradicts the claimed representation.\n\n      Nevertheless, Magellan contends that its subjective understanding27 of the\n\nterm “marketing volumes” can be a basis for fraud because the terms of the\n\nDistribution Agreement do not directly and expressly contradict its belief that these\n\ntwo words mean that any crude Enterprise owned or controlled at an Origin Point is\n\nforever subject to the agreement, regardless of any subsequent change in title, its\n\nultimate destination, or its routing along the way. This is, of course, directly and\n\nexpressly contradicted by the agreement, which defines “Owned” and “Controlled”\n\nto exclude crude transported “for the account of a party or parties other than\n\n\n27See Magellan Resp. Br. at 45 (describing what “Magellan understood” the term “marketing\nvolume” to mean).\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                      PAGE 25\n\n\n\n                                                                                            SR391\n\f[Enterprise] or its Affiliates.”28 And regardless of the mechanism used, whether\n\nbuy/sell or otherwise, a sale transfers title to a third party, at which point it is not\n\n“Owned” or “Controlled” by Enterprise.\n\n          “[R]eliance upon an oral representation that is directly contradicted by the\n\nexpress, unambiguous terms of a written agreement between the parties is not\n\njustified as a matter of law.” DRC Parts & Accessories, L.L.C. v.

But courts applying the principles set out in DRC\n\nParts have recognized that oral representations may “directly contradict” a contract\n\neven when the contract does not contain language that is the exact opposite, mirror\n\nimage of the alleged representation. In Rinard v. Bank of America, 349 S.W.3d 148,\n\n153 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, no pet.), for example, the court found no justifiable\n\nreliance based on the absence of a term. There, borrowers alleged that the lender\n\nrepresented that credit disability insurance would be purchased.             The note,\n\nhowever, referred only to joint credit life insurance. A statement that “no credit\n\ndisability insurance will be purchased” was not required—that could be deduced\n\nfrom the language of the agreement, and that was sufficient to negate justifiable\n\nreliance.\n\n          Similarly, in Freedom Equity Grp., Inc. v. MTL Ins. Co., No. 01-14-00210-CV,\n\n2015 WL 1135186, at *2-3 (Tex.

In that case, the plaintiff alleged that it was induced to\n\nenter a contract becoming a General Agent on a promise that, post-execution, it\n\nwould become a Managing Agent and its contractor would be demoted to General\n\nAgent under it. The contract did not address—either positively or negatively—the\n\nchanging of titles. Nevertheless, the fact that the plaintiff entered a contract to\n\nbecome a General Agent, combined with the contract’s merger clause, 29 was\n\nsufficient to negate reliance on any promise. Id.\n\n       Here, Magellan entered into a contract that specified the requirements for\n\ncrude to be subject to the agreement, and they are: (1) that the crude be Owned or\n\nControlled by Enterprise or an affiliate; (2) that the crude come from an Origin\n\nPoint; (3) that it travel through the Connection Point; and (4) that it arrive at a\n\nDestination Point.       Any statement that crude not meeting these requirements\n\nwould nevertheless be subject to the agreement directly contradicts these express\n\nterms, and is, as a matter of law, unjustifiable. See DRC Parts, 112 S.W.3d at 858-\n\n\n\n\n29 Here, too, the Distribution Agreement provides that “[t]his Agreement between the Parties\ncomprises the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and\nthere are no agreements, understandings, requirements, warranties or representations, oral or\nwritten, expressed or implied, that are not merged herein or superseded hereby, other than as set\nforth in the Joint Tariff.” Distr. Agr. § 9.7. Where a contract is negotiated at arms-length by\nsophisticated businessmen represented by counsel, this type of “merger” clause, is enforceable and\nnegates reliance on any alleged oral representations, an essential element of fraud as set out in the\ncharge above.

To be actionable fraud, the individual who\n\nmade the allegedly false statement must also have the requisite scienter, i.e., the\n\nspeaker must have known the statement was false and intended that the other\n\nparty act in reliance on it.

The Everett email contains a\n\nstatement regarding an Enterprise engineer’s belief about the intent of the\n\nDistribution Agreement.30 Magellan offers nothing to suggest that statement was\n\nfalse, was known by Everett to be false, or that Everett intended that Magellan act\n\nin reliance on it.\n\n          Additionally, a representation about the legal effect of a document is a\n\nstatement of opinion rather than a statement of fact and will not support a fraud\n\nclaim.

Everett’s statement cannot\n\nsupport a fraud claim because it merely expressed an opinion about the effect of the\n\nterms of the contract, a matter to which Magellan had equal access and about which\n\nMagellan would be expected to have its own opinion and exercise its own judgment.\n\n\n\n30   Magellan Resp. Br., Ex. 1-A, page 65.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                    PAGE 28\n\n\n\n                                                                                          SR394\n\fMatheson, 444 S.W.3d at 290; Cheung-Loon, 392 S.W.3d at 746.               There is no\n\nactionable fraud here, and summary judgment should be granted.\n\nG.    Magellan is not entitled to delay disposition of its meritless case.\n\n      There are two reasons the Court should reject any assertions by Magellan\n\nthat Enterprise’s summary judgment motion should be denied as “premature.”\n\nFirst, Magellan’s argument and its cursory request for a continuance on these\n\ngrounds is unsupported under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(g).                   A\n\ncontinuance is appropriate only “if it appears ‘from the affidavits of a party opposing\n\nthe [summary judgment] motion that he cannot for reasons stated present by\n\naffidavit facts essential to justify his opposition.’” Joe v. Two Thirty Nine J.V., 145\n\nS.W.3d 150, 161 (Tex. 2004) (quoting Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(g)) (emphasis\n\nadded). Here, however, there are no affidavits attached to Magellan’s summary\n\njudgment response explaining why Magellan cannot, by its own affidavit, present\n\nfacts essential to justify its opposition. So Magellan is not entitled to a continuance.\n\n      Second,    Magellan’s   request   should    be   denied   because   discovery   is\n\nunnecessary. As Enterprise has explained in its motion, and reinforced above, the\n\nDistribution Agreement is not ambiguous and must be construed as a matter of\n\nlaw. So there are no fact issues and no discovery is required. See, e.g., Nat’l Union\n\nFire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. CBI Indus., Inc., 907 S.W.2d 517, 520–22 (Tex.\n\n1995) (holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to a chance to conduct discovery,\n\nand thereby manufacture a contractual ambiguity with inadmissible parol evidence\n\nobtained through discovery, where there were no factual issues meriting discovery\n\non meaning of unambiguous contractual language). The Court should therefore\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                     PAGE 29\n\n\n\n                                                                                           SR395\n\fdeny Magellan’s request to delay the Court’s ruling on this motion, grant\n\nEnterprise’s summary judgment motion, and dismiss this action in its entirety.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      Summary judgment is appropriate in this case, which turns on the\n\nconstruction of an unambiguous contract. That proper construction vitiates all of\n\nMagellan’s claims, and those patently unmeritorious claims should be eliminated\n\nthrough summary judgment. See Swilley v. Hughes, 488 S.W.2d 64, 68 (Tex. 1972).\n\nEnterprise respectfully requests that the Court grant its motion and enter summary\n\njudgment in favor of Enterprise on all of Magellan’s claim.\n\nDated: September 20, 2017                     Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              /s/ Courtney Barksdale Perez\n                                              E.

Magellan has always\n\nagreed that a protective order is appropriate and has remained willing to negotiate over reasonable\n\nterms that provide adequate protection while not preventing either party from preparing its case.\n\nBut, through the use of hyperbole and unsupported accusations, Enterprise has attempted to turn\n\nthe protective order discussions into a trial over Magellan’s motives in seeking and using\n\ndiscovery.\n\n             Despite lengthy negotiations after the December 4, 2017 hearing on compromise forms of\n\nprotective order proposed by Magellan, Enterprise’s counsel failed to send the compromise revised\n\nform he promised, instead proposing that Magellan scrap all other proposals and agree to a form\n\nentered into in another unrelated case in a different jurisdiction that was based on the form of order\n\naccepted by that jurisdiction.\n\n               At a Minimum, Revisions Are Necessary to Enterprise’s Proposed Form\n\n             The protective order proposed by Enterprise is not appropriate in this case in the form in\n\nwhich Enterprise proposed it.

To highlight, the following necessary revisions\n\nhave been made:\n\n                •   The list of “Qualified Persons” who have the ability to view information designated\n                    “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only” has been expanded to include:\n\n                        o In-house counsel actively assisting in the litigation and whose job is to\n                          manage litigation. Specifically excluded are in-house counsel who make or\n                          participate in competitive business matters of the parties.\n                        o Auditors employed by the parties.\n                        o Witnesses currently employed by the parties or witnesses who were\n                          employed by the parties at the time the designated information was\n                          generated.\n                        o Court reporters, as well as litigation vendors and other litigation support\n                          personnel.\n\n                •   The description of how material will be designated “For Counsel Only” or\n                    “Attorneys Eyes Only” has been clarified to describe that if only a portion of a\n                    document is “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only”, then only that portion\n                    will be noted as such, allowing the rest of the document that is either not “Classified\n                    Information” or is only “Confidential” to be treated as such.\n\n                •   With the expansion of the list of “Qualified Persons” who can review “For Counsel\n                    Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only” information, the provision requiring all materials\n                    designated as such be maintained at the offices of counsel or experts has been\n                    removed.\n\n                •   The requirement that a party log all “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only”\n                    documents shown to Qualified Persons has been removed.\n\n                •   The procedure for challenging designation as a Qualified Person, which had no\n                    correlating procedure for designating someone as a Qualified Person, has been\n                    removed.\n\n                •   The procedure for returning documents has been modified to allow retained counsel\n                    to maintain one copy of documents produced in this case and designated as\n                    Classified Information.\n\n             As noted in prior filings, this case centers on a Crude Oil Distribution (“COD”) Agreement\n\nthat specifically provides Magellan “the right to audit Shipper’s [Enterprise’s] records necessary\n\nto verify Shipper’s [Enterprise’s] compliance with the provisions of Sections 4.1 [Transportation\n\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 2\n{1773121;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                              SR399\n\fCommitment] and 4.2 [Transportation Commitment Exceptions].” The parties in this case agreed\n\nthat Magellan has a right to inspect the information that is the subject of discovery in this case, and\n\nEnterprise agreed that an audit of the information is appropriate. Limiting access to information\n\nproduced by Enterprise in this case to retained counsel will unfairly and unreasonably hamstring\n\nthe ability of Magellan’s retained counsel to consult with their client as necessary to prepare\n\nMagellan’s case. Despite the attempt by Enterprise to portray this dispute as a simple issue of\n\nvolumes, the filings to date and those attached to this supplement reveal that the issues are\n\ncomplicated and require persons who understand the business that is the subject of the COD\n\nAgreement to analyze the information to determine whether Enterprise has complied with its\n\nobligations under the COD Agreement.\n\n             And to the extent that Enterprise contends that the limits it seeks to impose will apply to a\n\nsmall subset of documents, that contention is counter to Enterprise’s many filings in this case to\n\ndate, including its filing with the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Judicial District. For example, in\n\nits response to Magellan’s motion to compel Enterprise to produce documents responsive to its\n\nrequests for production, Enterprise stated:\n\n                    Subject to the entry of a protective order, Enterprise has already\n                    agreed to produce any communications regarding the conversion of\n                    business arrangements for crude transported from the Origin Points,\n                    and any communications that discuss Magellan or the Distribution\n                    Agreement. Enterprise has also agreed to provide summary volume\n                    information for the “relevant period” defined in the requests (similar\n                    to information Enterprise already produced during the audits subject\n                    to a Confidentiality Agreement). The remaining documents,\n                    however, reveal Enterprise’s trade secrets and they must be shielded\n                    from discovery under Texas Rule of Evidence 507 absent a showing\n                    by Magellan that such information is necessary to its case.\n\n(Enter. Resp. to Mot. to Compel, p.6) (Emphasis added).\n\n             Accordingly, not only is it necessary that the list of Qualified Persons be slightly broader\n\nthan retained counsel, it is necessary that the Protective Order require a party designating\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 3\n{1773121;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             SR400\n\finformation “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only” be specific about its designations,\n\ndesignating only the portion of a document, or a page of a document, that the party believes\n\nwarrants the restrictive designation.\n\n             The few remaining revisions are warranted to make the Protective Order manageable in the\n\ncontext of this case, where Enterprise has telegraphed its intent to designate most, if not everything,\n\nit is producing as Classified Information. This is shown by the fact that prior to the December 4,\n\n2017 hearing on Magellan’s Motion to Compel, Enterprise had not produced one document\n\nresponsive to Magellan’s requests. And, since that date, Enterprise has produced to Magellan only\n\na small set of documents that appear to be the same as the documents previously provided to\n\nMagellan in its contractually-permitted audits.\n\n              Enterprise’s Shifting Positions May Require the Court to Revisit This Issue\n\n             Regardless of which form of Protective Order the Court enters, it may need to be modified\n\nonce the details of Enterprise’s production and confidentiality designations become clearer than\n\nthey are now. To date, Enterprise’s has made so many conflicting and inconsistent representations\n\nthat it is impossible to know how much information Enterprise will be producing, from what\n\nsource(s),1 what specific information Enterprise deems to be “trade secret,” 2 and whether the trade\n\n\n1\n  In Magellan’s pre-suit audits, Enterprise provided some information which apparently came from\nEnterprise Pipeline (its pipeline affiliate), and in its original responses to the discovery requests Magellan\nserved on July 21, 2017, Enterprise did not object on the ground that the requests seek documents possessed\nor controlled by Enterprise Pipeline, although Enterprise objected on every other imaginable ground. See\nEx. 3. However, in the Amended Objections Enterprise served on the eve of the December 4, 2017\ndiscovery hearings, Enterprise stated for the first time that it will not produce its affiliates’ documents. See\nEx. 4.\n2\n  Enterprise has consistently refused to identify, specifically, the responsive information for which it claims\ntrade secret protection, relying instead on a general “compilation” theory that practically all of its business\ninformation is trade secret. And even that is a moving target, as can be seen by comparing Enterprise’s\noriginal objections to Magellan’s discovery requests (Ex. 3) to its amended objections (Ex. 4). Among many\nother changes, the amended objections Enterprise served on the eve of the December 4, 2017 discovery\nhearing dropped its previously asserted trade secret objections to seven of Magellan requests for production,\nincluding RFPs 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 30, and 31.\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 4\n{1773121;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                   SR401\n\fsecret information Enterprise seeks to restrict to Magellan’s outside counsel’s eyes only, is\n\nminimal or voluminous.\n\n             For example, Enterprise never claimed that the any of the information it provided to\n\nMagellan during the course of Magellan’s pre-suit audits is “trade secret” information, and it never\n\nsought to prevent any of Magellan’s auditors or business personnel from reviewing that\n\ninformation.3 However, Enterprise’s discovery responses indicate that Enterprise now claims\n\n“trade secret” protection for all the information it provided to Magellan during the pre-suit audits,\n\nalong with all other information necessary to trace the movement of Eagle Ford barrels from an\n\nOrigin Point to a final destination point or to verify Enterprise’s assertions; i.e., that to the extent\n\nEnterprise is required to produce such information in this case, it seeks or may seek to restrict\n\nreview to Magellan’s outside counsel only. 1\n\n             Enterprise’s representations to this Court, and to the Court of Appeals, portend just such\n\nan overly broad designation of “trade secret” information, in an effort to unfairly and improperly\n\nhamstring Magellan’s ability to understand and utilize discovery obtained in this litigation, for this\n\n\n3\n  Such information included copies of some transportation agreements and some Eagle Ford crude oil\npurchase contracts or buy-sell contracts between Enterprise and its customers, without redaction of\ncustomer identities and most of the terms of the contracts. By emails, Enterprise also provided partial\ninformation, or unverified assertions, that: (i) Enterprise batches a common stream barrel at the Origin\nPoints and sells a common stream barrel at the applicable destination but does not tie a specific Origin Point\nto a barrel sold at a different location; (ii) Enterprise sells barrels that come from an Eagle Ford Origin Point\nto unaffiliated third parties at ECHO Terminal, Genoa Junction, or other destinations; (iii) deliveries\nEnterprise makes from an Origin Point to its ECHO Terminal do not go through the Magellan connection\npoint [at Genoa Junction] prior to delivery to a final destination; and (iv) when Enterprise sells Eagle Ford\nbarrels to a customer at ECHO Terminal, Enterprise does not track subsequent transportation thereof to any\nfinal destination. Yet Enterprise also asserted that certain barrels were delivered through Enterprise\nfacilities (not Magellan facilities) based on transportation nominations made by Enterprise’s customers, and\nthat some product was transported by a customer from ECHO Terminal to a designated Destination Point,\nbut not through the Magellan facilities, because that was “not the most direct routing.” See emails identified\nas Ex. 5. Pending determination whether and to what extent (if any) the Enterprise emails are properly\ndesignated as confidential information, Magellan has omitted them from the copy of this Supplement filed\nin the public record. Magellan will provide Exhibit 5 to the Court and will comply with the Court’s direction\nregarding filing the same in some redacted version, or under seal if appropriate, following the hearing.\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT.

Whenever Enterprise attempts to justify its refusal to produce the vast majority of the\n\nrequested documents, or to persuade the Court of Appeals that this Court’s order compelling\n\nproduction is an abuse of discretion, Enterprise represents that “most of Magellan’s requests are\n\naimed at obtaining discovery of Enterprise’s trade secrets,”4 and that this Court’s order compelling\n\nproduction encompasses “volumes of proven trade secrets.”5 Yet when Enterprise urges this Court\n\nto impose draconian restrictions on Magellan’s ability to use any “trade secret” information\n\nEnterprise may produce, it represents the opposite, that the trade secret documents will only\n\namount to a “select group of highly sensitive information.”6\n\n                                                 Conclusion\n\n             While a protective order is warranted in this case, the facts presented to this Court do not\n\nsupport entry of the protective order Enterprise seeks. Enterprise objected to almost all of\n\nMagellan’s discovery requests to it and the nonparties as seeking trade secrets and is pursuing a\n\nwrit of mandamus on the same grounds. To limit Magellan’s review of this information to only\n\nMagellan’s retained counsel would make preparation of this case extremely and unnecessarily\n\ndifficult and expensive. Under Enterprise’s proposal, only outside counsel or experts could review\n\ninformation Enterprise now claims to be “trade secret.” Given the audit right provided in the\n\ncontract at issue, and the fact Enterprise previously provided Magellan information in the audits\n\ndid not claim (but now contends) is trade secret, the modestly broader list of authorized persons\n\nproposed by Magellan in the revised protective order is appropriate. For all of these reasons, and\n\nthose previously described in its response to Enterprise’s motion, Magellan respectfully urges the\n\nCourt to approve the protective order attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n\n\n4\n    See Defendant’s Response to Motion to Compel, p. 1.\n5\n    Defendant’s Petition for Writ of Mandamus, p. 25, excerpt attached as Ex. 6 (emphasis added).\n6\n    See Defendant’s Motion for Entry of a Protective Order, p. 1 (emphasis added).\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT.

Information that is generally\n available to the public, such as public filings, catalogues, advertising materials, and the like, shall not\n be designated as Classified.\n\n            Information and documents that may be designated as Classified Information include, but are\n not limited to, trade secrets, confidential or proprietary financial information, operational data,\n business plans, and competitive analyses, personnel files, personal information that is protected by\n law, and other sensitive information that, if not restricted as set forth in this order, may subject the\n producing or disclosing person to competitive or financial injury or potential legal liability to third\n parties.\n\n            Correspondence and other communications between the parties or with nonparties may be\n designated as Classified Information if the communication was made with the understanding or\n reasonable expectation that the information would not become generally available to the public.\n\n            c.     For Counsel or Attorneys Only. The designation “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes\n Only” shall be reserved for information that is believed to be unknown to the opposing party or\n parties, or any of the employees of a corporate party. For purposes of this order, so-designated\n information includes, but is not limited to, product formula information, design information, non-\n public financial information, pricing information, customer identification data, and certain study\n methodologies.\n\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 23\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               SR420\n\f         d.      Ultrasensitive Information. At this point, the parties do not anticipate the need for higher\n levels of confidentiality as to ultrasensitive documents or information. However, in the event that a\n court orders that ultrasensitive documents or information be produced, the parties will negotiate and\n ask the court to enter an ultrasensitive information protocol in advance of production to further\n protect such information.\n\n     4. Use of Classified Information\n\n     All Classified Information provided by any party or nonparty in the course of this litigation shall\n be used solely for the purpose of preparation, trial, and appeal of this litigation and for no other\n purpose, and shall not be disclosed except in accordance with the terms hereof.\n\n     5. Marking of Documents\n\n     Documents provided in this litigation may be designated by the producing person or by any party\n as Classified Information by marking each page of the documents so designated with a stamp\n indicating that the information is “Confidential”, “For Counsel Only”, or “Attorneys Eyes Only”. If\n only part of a document is designated “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only”, the designating\n party shall produce two copies of the item—one copy with the “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys\n Eyes Only” information noted but visible, and one copy with the “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys\n Eyes Only” information shielded from visibility. In lieu of marking the original of a document, if the\n original is not provided, the designating party may mark the copies that are provided. Originals shall\n be preserved for inspection.\n\n     6. Disclosure at Depositions\n\n     Information disclosed at (a) the deposition of a party or one of its present or former officers,\n directors, employees, agents, consultants, representatives, or independent experts retained by counsel\n for the purpose of this litigation, or (b) the deposition of a nonparty may be designated by any party\n as Classified Information by indicating on the record at the deposition that the testimony is\n “Confidential” or “For Counsel Only” and is subject to the provisions of this Order.\n\n     Any party also may designate information disclosed at a deposition as Classified Information by\n notifying all parties in writing not later than 10 days of receipt of the transcript of the specific pages\n and lines of the transcript that should be treated as Classified Information thereafter. Each party shall\n attach a copy of each such written notice to the face of the transcript and each copy thereof in that\n party’s possession, custody, or control. All deposition transcripts shall be treated as For Counsel Only\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 24\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                SR421\n\f for a period of 10 days after initial receipt of the transcript.\n\n     To the extent possible, the court reporter shall segregate into separate transcripts information\n designated as Classified Information with blank, consecutively numbered pages being provided in a\n nondesignated main transcript. The separate transcript containing Classified Information shall have\n page numbers that correspond to the blank pages in the main transcript.\n\n     Counsel for a party or a nonparty witness shall have the right to exclude from depositions any\n person who is not authorized to receive Classified Information pursuant to this Protective Order, but\n such right of exclusion shall be applicable only during periods of examination or testimony during\n which Classified Information is being used or discussed.\n\n     7. Disclosure to Qualified Persons\n\n     To Whom. Classified Information shall not be disclosed or made available by the receiving party\nto persons other than Qualified Persons except as necessary to comply with applicable law or the\nvalid order of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that in the event of a disclosure\ncompelled by law or court order, the receiving party will so notify the producing party as promptly as\npracticable (if at all possible, prior to making such disclosure) and shall seek a protective order or\nconfidential treatment of such information. Information designated as For Counsel Only shall be\nrestricted in circulation to Qualified Persons described in subparagraph 2(a).\n\n         a. Retention of Copies During this Litigation. Copies of For Counsel Only information shall be\n maintained only in the offices of outside counsel for the receiving party and, to the extent supplied to\n experts described in subparagraph 2(a)(ii), in the offices of those experts. Any documents produced\n in this litigation, regardless of classification, that are provided to Qualified Persons shall be maintained\n only at the office of such Qualified Person and only necessary working copies of any such documents\n shall be made. Copies of documents and exhibits containing Classified Information may be prepared\n by independent copy services, printers, or illustrators for the purpose of this litigation.\n\n         b. Each party’s outside counsel shall maintain a log of all copies of For Counsel Only\n documents that are delivered to Qualified Persons.\n\n     8. Unintentional Disclosures\n\n     Documents unintentionally produced without designation as Classified Information later may be\n designated and shall be treated as Classified Information from the date written notice of the\n\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 25\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                SR422\n\f designation is provided to the receiving party.\n\n     If a receiving party learns of any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential information or For\n Counsel Only information, the party shall immediately upon learning of such disclosure inform the\n producing party of all pertinent facts relating to such disclosure and shall make all reasonable efforts\n to prevent disclosure by each unauthorized person who received such information.\n\n     9. Documents Produced for Inspection Prior to Designation\n\n     In the event documents are produced for inspection prior to designation, the documents shall be\n treated as For Counsel Only during inspection. At the time of copying for the receiving parties,\n Classified Information shall be marked prominently “Confidential”, “For Counsel Only”, or\n “Attorneys Eyes Only” by the producing party.\n\n     10. Consent to Disclosure and Use in Examination\n\n     Nothing in this order shall prevent disclosure beyond the terms of this order if each party\n designating the information as Classified Information consents to such disclosure or if the court, after\n notice to all affected parties and nonparties, orders such disclosure. Nor shall anything in this order\n prevent any counsel of record from utilizing Classified Information in the examination or cross-\n examination of any person who is indicated on the document as being an author, source, or recipient\n of the Classified Information, irrespective of which party produced such information.\n\n     11. Challenging the Designation\n\n      Classified Information. A party shall not be obligated to challenge the propriety of a designation of\nClassified Information at the time such designation is made, and a failure to do so shall not preclude a\nsubsequent challenge to the designation. In the event that any party to this litigation disagrees at any\nstage of these proceedings with the designation of any information as Classified Information, the parties\nshall first try to resolve the dispute in good faith on an informal basis, such as by production of redacted\ncopies. If the dispute cannot be resolved, the objecting party may invoke this Protective Order by\nobjecting in writing to the party who designated the document or information as Classified Information.\nThe designating party shall then have 14 days to move the court for an order preserving the designated\nstatus of the disputed information. The disputed information shall remain Classified Information unless\nand until the court orders otherwise.\n     Failure to move for an order shall constitute a termination of the status of such item as Classified\nInformation.\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 26\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               SR423\n\f         a. Qualified Persons. In the event that any party in good faith disagrees with the designation of\n a person as a Qualified Person or the disclosure of particular Classified Information to such person,\n the parties shall first try to resolve the dispute in good faith on an informal basis. If the dispute cannot\n be resolved, the objecting party shall have 14 days from the date of the designation or, in the event\n particular Classified Information is requested subsequent to the designation of the Qualified Person,\n 14 days from service of the request to move the court for an order denying the disposed person (a)\n status as a Qualified Person, or (b) access to particular Classified Information. The objecting person\n shall have the burden of demonstrating that disclosure to the disputed person would expose the\n objecting party to the risk of serious harm. Upon the timely filing of such a motion, no disclosure of\n Classified Information shall be made to the disputed person unless and until the court enters an order\n preserving the designation.\n\n     12. Manner of Use in Proceedings\n\n     In the event a party wishes to use any Classified Information in affidavits, declarations, briefs,\n memoranda of law, or other papers filed in this litigation, the party shall do one of the following: (1)\n with the consent of the producing party, file only a redacted copy of the information; (2) where\n appropriate (e.g., in connection with discovery and evidentiary motions) provide the information\n solely for in camera review; or (3) file such information under seal with the court consistent with the\n sealing requirements of the court.\n\n     13. Filing Under Seal\n\n     The clerk of this court is directed to maintain under seal all documents, transcripts of deposition\n testimony, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and other papers filed under seal in this litigation\n that have been designated, in whole or in part, as Classified Information by any party to this litigation\n consistent with the sealing requirements and standards of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 76a.\n\n     14. Return of Documents\n\n     Not later than 60 days after conclusion of this litigation and any appeal related to it, any Classified\n Information, all reproductions of such information, and any notes, summaries, or descriptions of such\n information in the possession of any of the persons specified in paragraph 2 (except subparagraph\n 2(a)(iii)) shall be returned to the producing party or destroyed, except as this court may otherwise\n order or to the extent such information has been used as evidence at any trial                 or hearing.\n Notwithstanding this obligation to return or destroy information, counsel may retain attorney work\n\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

Ongoing Obligations\n\n     Insofar as the provisions of this Protective Order, or any other protective orders entered in this\n litigation, restrict the communication and use of the information protected by it, such provisions shall\n continue to be binding after the conclusion of this litigation, except that (a) there shall be no restriction\n on documents that are used as exhibits in open court unless such exhibits were filed under seal, and\n (b) a party may seek the written permission of the producing party or order of the court with respect\n to dissolution or modification of this, or any other, protective order.\n\n     16. Advice to Clients\n\n     This order shall not bar any attorney in the course of rendering advice to such attorney’s client\n with respect to this litigation from conveying to any party client the attorney’s evaluation in a general\n way of Classified Information produced or exchanged under the terms of this order; provided,\n however, that in rendering such advice and otherwise communicating with the client, the attorney\n shall not disclose the specific contents of any Classified Information produced by another party if\n such disclosure would be contrary to the terms of this Protective Order.\n\n     17. Duty to Ensure Compliance\n\n     Any party designating any person as a Qualified Person shall have the duty to reasonably ensure\n that such person observes the terms of this Protective Order and shall be responsible upon breach of\n such duty for the failure of such person to observe the terms of this Protective Order.\n\n     18. Legal Effect.\n     This Protective Order shall not abrogate or diminish any contractual, statutory, or other legal\nprivilege or protection of a Party or person with respect to any information. The fact that any materials\nare designated Confidential Information pursuant to this Protective Order shall not affect or operate as\na means of objection to the admissibility of any such material. The fact that materials are designated as\nConfidential Information pursuant to this Protective Order shall not affect what a trier of fact in the\nproceedings may find to be confidential or proprietary.

Bryant, GableGotwals, 113 Pleasant Valley Drive, Suite 204, Boerne,\n        Texas 78006; Lisa T. Silvestri, GableGotwals, 100 W. Fifth Street, Suite 1100, Tulsa,\n        Oklahoma 74103; and Bill E. Davidoff, Figari & Davenport, LLP, 901 Main Street, Suite\n        3400, Dallas, Texas 75202.\n\n        Defendant Enterprise Crude Oil LLC (“Enterprise” or “Defendant”) serves its Objections\n\nand Responses to Plaintiff’s First Request for Production, served on July 21, 2017, as follows:\n\n                                    I.      INTRODUCTION\n\n        1.      These Responses and Objections are made solely for the purposes of this action.\n\nEach Response is subject to all objections as to confidence, privilege, relevance, materiality,\n\npropriety, admissibility, and any and all other objections and grounds that would require the\n\nexclusion of any statement, admission, or document, if any requests were made, or any statement\n\ncontained herein were made by a witness present and testifying in court or at a hearing, or any\n\ndocuments produced herein were proffered as evidence in court or at a hearing, all of which\n\nobjections and grounds are reserved and may be interposed at the time of trial or hearing.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                                  PAGE 1\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 30\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR427\n\f        2.     Discovery, independent investigation, legal research and analysis will lead to\n\nadditional facts and evidence, and may establish entirely new factual conclusions and legal\n\ncontentions, all of which may lead to additions to, changes in and variations from the present\n\nresponses. Consequently, the following responses are given without prejudice to Enterprise’s\n\nright to produce, at time of motions or trial, such further information or facts as may hereafter\n\nbecome known and available to it.\n\n        3.     The following Responses and Objections are based upon information presently\n\navailable to Enterprise and, except for explicit facts admitted herein, no incidental or implied\n\nadmissions are intended hereby. The fact that Enterprise has responded or objected to any of the\n\nrequests, or part thereof, should not be taken as an admission that Enterprise accepts or admits\n\nthe existence of any facts set forth or assumed by such requests and/or that such response\n\nconstitutes admissible evidence. The fact that Enterprise has responded to all or part of a request\n\nis not intended and shall not be construed to be a waiver by Enterprise of all or any part of any\n\nobjection(s) to any request. Enterprise reserves the right to amend or supplement the following\n\nresponses in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure as this matter proceeds.\n\n        4.     The responses given herein exclude from their scope all documents or tangible\n\nthings (1) containing communications between counsel for Enterprise or between Enterprise and\n\nits counsel; (2) generated or prepared in anticipation of litigation by or for Enterprise or its\n\nrepresentatives; and (3) reflecting the mental impressions, strategies, and analysis of Enterprise’s\n\ncounsel, and all such materials are being withheld. If Enterprise inadvertently produces any\n\ninformation or documents protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine,\n\nor any other privilege or protection, such production is not intended to and shall not operate as a\n\nwaiver of its privileges.\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                                 PAGE 2\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 31\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR428\n\f        5.     Many of Magellan’s requests seek production of documents already in Magellan’s\n\npossession, custody, or control, such as communications exchanged between the parties,\n\ndocuments Enterprise has already provided to Plaintiff, or documents Magellan itself has\n\nprovided to Enterprise. Enterprise will not reproduce such documents unless Magellan is willing\n\nto bear the cost of the production.\n\n        6.     By stating that it has produced or will produce documents within its possession,\n\ncustody or control, Enterprise does not represent that any such documents exist. Rather,\n\nEnterprise is responding only that, to the extent such documents exist and are located, they have\n\nbeen or will be produced subject to and without waiver of any objection.\n\n                           II.        OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 1. Regarding the COD Agreement, the following\nDocuments created or generated on or before October 31, 2011: (a) all drafts of said agreement;\n(b) all Documents constituting or reflecting Communications between Magellan and Enterprise,\nregarding said agreement; and (c) all Documents constituting or reflecting Enterprise internal\nCommunications regarding said agreement.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects that this request seeks information that is not relevant or reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Neither Enterprise nor Magellan contend that\nthere is any ambiguity in COD Agreement. As such, its terms are to be construed by the Court\nas a matter of law. This request seeks parol evidence, that is, extrinsic evidence relating to the\nparties’ motives, intent or understanding in entering into the COD Agreement, which evidence is\ninadmissible when, as here, the terms of the parties’ agreement are unambiguous. Moreover, the\nCOD Agreement, which must be read together with the related-writings that give the effect to the\nCOD Agreement (i.e. the Connection Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement, etc.) contains a\nmerger clause. Thus, by the COD Agreement’s express terms, drafts, documents between\nMagellan and Enterprise concerning the COD Agreement and/or internal communications\nregarding the COD Agreement are not relevant.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information that is not reasonably available as requested and\nsome of which Enterprise cannot retrieve without unreasonable effort and expense.

Second, Enterprise does not dispute Magellan’s\ncontention that Enterprise has utilized the Rancho II pipeline system to transport crude during the\nterm of the COD Agreement. The relevant question then, is whether Enterprise’s utilization of\nRancho II somehow constitutes a breach of COD Agreement. Because the discovery sought in\nthis request would not answer this question, and instead seeks irrelevant information concerning\na fact that is not in dispute, it constitutes nothing more than an impermissible fishing expedition.\nSee In re Am.

This request includes\nany and all such agreements ever in existence during the Relevant Period, even if no Eagle Ford\nProduct was actually purchased or sold pursuant thereto and regardless of whether the agreement\nwas subsequently amended, restated, terminated, rescinded, repealed, replaced or abandoned. So,\nfor example, this request includes the following agreements as well as all similar agreements:\nFirst Amended and Restated Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement between Enterprise and\nChesapeake Energy Corporation, dated January 31, 2012; First Amended and Restated Crude Oil\nPurchase and Sale Agreement between Enterprise and Petrohawk Energy Corporation, dated\nJune 29, 2012; First Amended and Restated Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement between\nEnterprise and GeoSouthern Energy Corporation, dated June 29, 2012.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects that this request seeks information that is not relevant or reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

Because it seeks information\nconcerning facts that are not in dispute and does not concern any claim or defense at issue in this\ncase, this request constitutes nothing more than an impermissible fishing expedition. See In re\nAm. Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711, 713 (Tex. 1998) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam) (“This\nCourt has repeatedly emphasized that discovery may not be used as a fishing expedition. Rather\nrequests must be reasonably tailored to included only matters relevant to the case”) (emphasis\nadded) (internal citations omitted)).\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information that is not reasonably available as requested and\nsome of which Enterprise cannot retrieve without unreasonable effort and expense. The request\nis also unduly burdensome because it fails to identify particular custodians, purporting to require\na search of the entire company. Moreover, the burden imposed by this request far outweighs the\nbenefit to Magellan and is disproportionate to the needs of this case. In re State Farm Lloyds,\n520 S.W.3d 595 (Tex. 2017).\n\nEnterprise further objects to the request because the information sought discusses, concerns\nand/or contains Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets.\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 27. All Documents showing any Enterprise tariffs, fees,\ncharges or incentives for transportation and distribution of crude oil from ECHO Terminal to any\nDestination Point or any Future Destination Point.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects that this request is overbroad, unduly burdensome and seeks information that\nis not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

Enterprise is\nnot required to marshal its evidence in response to an overly broad request.\n\nEnterprise further objects to this request as premature. Discovery is ongoing and Enterprise\nexpects its own discovery efforts, if necessary, to result in Enterprise’s receipt of documents and\ninformation relevant to its defenses, affirmative defenses, and responsive to this request.

INTRODUCTION\n\n       1.      Discovery, independent investigation, legal research and analysis will lead to\n\nadditional facts and evidence, and may establish entirely new factual conclusions and legal\n\ncontentions, all of which may lead to additions to, changes in and variations from the present\n\nresponses. Consequently, the following responses are given without prejudice to Enterprise’s\n\nright to produce, at time of motions or trial, such further information or facts as may hereafter\n\nbecome known and available to it.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S AMENDED OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                               PAGE 1\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

The following Responses and Objections are based upon information presently\n\navailable to Enterprise and, except for explicit facts admitted herein, no incidental or implied\n\nadmissions are intended hereby. The fact that Enterprise has responded or objected to any of the\n\nrequests, or part thereof, should not be taken as an admission that Enterprise accepts or admits\n\nthe existence of any facts set forth or assumed by such requests and/or that such response\n\nconstitutes admissible evidence. The fact that Enterprise has responded to all or part of a request\n\nis not intended and shall not be construed to be a waiver by Enterprise of all or any part of any\n\nobjection(s) to any request. Enterprise reserves the right to amend or supplement the following\n\nresponses in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure as this matter proceeds.\n\n       3.      Enterprise objects to the definition of “Enterprise” used by Magellan in its\n\nrequests, which purports to impose discovery obligations upon corporate entities other than\n\nEnterprise Crude Oil, LLC. As used in these objections and responses, “Enterprise” refers to\n\nEnterprise Crude Oil, LLC and its predecessors and successors only, and Enterprise assumes no\n\nobligation to produce documents in the care, custody and control of other entities in responding\n\nto these requests.\n\n       4.      By stating that it has produced or will produce documents within its possession,\n\ncustody or control, Enterprise does not represent that any such documents exist.

Neither Enterprise nor Magellan contend that\nthere is any ambiguity in COD Agreement. As such, its terms are to be construed by the Court\nas a matter of law. This request seeks parol evidence, that is, extrinsic evidence relating to the\nparties’ motives, intent or understanding in entering into the COD Agreement, which evidence is\ninadmissible when, as here, the terms of the parties’ agreement are unambiguous. Moreover, the\nCOD Agreement, which must be read together with the related-writings that give the effect to the\nCOD Agreement (i.e. the Connection Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement, etc.) contains a\nmerger clause. Thus, by the COD Agreement’s express terms, drafts, documents between\nMagellan and Enterprise concerning the COD Agreement and/or internal communications\nregarding the COD Agreement are not relevant.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information because it fails to identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company. Should the Court determine that the\nrequested information is discoverable, Enterprise will confer with Magellan regarding the proper\ncustodians and search terms for responding to this request.\n\nEnterprise further objects to subpart (c) of the request because Enterprise’s internal\ncommunications discuss, concern and/or contain Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary\ninformation and trade secrets.\n\nEnterprise is withholding documents responsive to this request under the work product and/or\nattorney client privileges.

For\nexample, this request includes memos, reports or analyses regarding the intended, expected or\nactual utilization of the Rancho pipeline system and/or the Rancho II pipeline system for such\npurposes.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects to the request as overbroad and unduly burdensome because it seeks “all\ndocuments” “regarding” 14 distinct categories of documents contained within this request.\nEnterprise further objects that this request is not reasonably limited in scope to matters at issue in\nthis lawsuit. Indeed, it seeks information touching upon 14 categories of documents that\ncumulatively encompass Enterprise’s entire business within the Eagle Ford Basin. Such a\nrequest, without limitation, could encompass nearly every document and communication at\nEnterprise relating to its Gulf Coast operations.\n\nEnterprise further objects to the request because the information sought discusses, concerns\nand/or contains Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information but does not identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company.

The only relevant issue in this case is whether Enterprise had good faith business\nreasons for the decisions Magellan alleges improperly reduced Enterprise’s use of the Magellan\nfacilities. These are: (1) conversion of marketing agreements to buy/sell arrangements; (2)\nbuilding the Rancho II pipeline; (3) increasing the tariff between ECHO terminal and Genoa\njunction; and (4) disconnecting Anajuac Junction.

For clarity, recordings and notes of any phone calls or meetings\nbetween Magellan and Enterprise, regarding any of the above matters, are included. However,\nthis request is not intended to include inter-party Communications specifically regarding any\nMagellan Audit, as those are the subject of a separate request.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects to subpart (v) of the request, which seeks communications regarding “the\nmeaning, effect, or impact of the COD Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement or the Connection\nAgreement,” because such information is irrelevant, insofar as parol evidence is not admissible\nto alter the terms or meaning of an unambiguous agreement. Upon entry of an appropriate\nprotective order, Enterprise will produce communications between Magellan and Enterprise\nregarding the identified topics.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information but does not identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company.

Neither Enterprise nor Magellan\ncontend that there is any ambiguity in COD Agreement. As such, its terms are to be construed\nby the Court as a matter of law. This Request seeks parol evidence, i.e., information that is not\nrelevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Moreover, the\nCOD Agreement, which must be read together with the related-writings that give the effect to the\nCOD Agreement (i.e. the Connection Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement, etc.) contains a\nmerger clause. Thus, by the COD Agreement’s express terms, information concerning the\n“meaning or effect of the COD Agreement,” the “understanding or intention of any person or\nparty with respect to the COD Agreement” and the “rights or obligations of either party with\nrespect to the COD Agreement,” are not relevant.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information but does not identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company. Should the Court determine that the\nrequested information is discoverable, Enterprise will confer with Magellan regarding the proper\ncustodians and search terms for responding to this request.\n\nEnterprise is withholding documents responsive to this request under the work product and/or\nattorney client privileges.

Neither Enterprise nor Magellan dispute\nthe validity or enforceability of the COD Agreement. Therefore, documents concerning\nenforceability of the COD Agreement are not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of admissible evidence.\n\nEnterprise objects to subparts (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the request on the ground that the information\nsought is not relevant.

For clarity, this request seeks Documents sufficient to give\nMagellan the same tracing capability Enterprise has with respect to deliveries of crude oil from\nECHO Terminal to any Destination Point or Future Destination Point.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects to the request because the information sought discusses, concerns and/or\ncontains Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets.\n\nEnterprise further objects that this request is overbroad and seeks information that is not relevant\nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, in that no Future\nDestination Point is operational and therefore none is subject to the COD Agreement. Enterprise\nfurther objects to production of “all” documents that Enterprise uses or “could use” to trace\nproduct, because use of such terms fails to identify the information sought with particularity, and\ncould include voluminous information of little probative value, such as voluminous meter\nreadings providing duplicative information. Enterprise will produce summary volume\ninformation for shipments of Eagle Ford Product, but only to the extent (i) Enterprise is the\nshipper of record, (ii) the shipments originated at an Origin Point, and (iii) the shipment was\ndelivered to the ECHO Terminal, the Connection Point, or a Delivery Point.

The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion as a Matter of Law\n     When It Ordered Enterprise to Produce Its Trade Secrets,\n     and Refused to Quash Subpoenas Requiring Enterprise’s\n     Customers to Do So, Without a Showing of Necessity and\n     Without Adequate Protective Measures.\n       Beyond failing to address the overbreadth of Magellan’s requests,\n\nthe trial court further erred when it failed to address the trade-secret\n\nissues adequately. The trial court compelled Enterprise to respond to\n\nrequests that would encompass volumes of proven trade secrets, though\nMagellan made no showing that such information is necessary to the\n\ncase. In competitive markets like the crude oil market at issue, an\n\nentity's commercial information—its strategies, techniques, goals and\nplans—can be its “life blood.” Duracell Inc. v. SW Consultants, Inc., 126\n\nF.R.D. 576, 578 (N.D. Ga. 1989). However, “[t]he discovery rules are not\n\nintended to forfeit a party’s ability to compete effectively in the market\nby    opening        up    tangentially         relevant       financial       and   marketing\n\ninformation to competitors.” Id. That is especially true in Texas, where\n\ncourts are supposed to apply Texas Rule of Evidence 507.\n       Under Rule 507, Enterprise is entitled to withhold—and to\n\nprevent its customers from disclosing—its trade secrets to Magellan, an\n\navowed competitor. Tex. R. Evid. 507(a). Once Enterprise establishes\nthat the information Magellan is demanding is trade secret, such\n\ninformation cannot be produced until Magellan establishes that such\n\ninformation is necessary for a fair trial. In re Cont’l Gen. Tire, Inc.,\n\n979 S.W.2d 609, 615 (Tex.1998) (orig. proceeding). In fact, trial courts\n\n\n\n                                                 25\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

Exhibit 5 to\n\nMagellan’s first supplement is attached hereto, in redacted form, and marked as Exhibit A hereto.\n\n             During the December 28, 2017 hearing, Magellan provided Exhibit 5 to the Court and to\n\nEnterprise, in unredacted form. At that time, Magellan’s counsel inquired whether and to what\n\nextent Enterprise deems the content of Exhibit 5 confidential information, but the Enterprise\n\nattorney presenting Enterprise’s Motion for Entry of a Protective Order, Mr. Bennett, stated that\n\nhe was unable to answer and referred Magellan to another Enterprise attorney, Ms. Stahl.\n\nImmediately following the hearing, Magellan provided Exhibit 5 to Ms. Stahl, noting that one of\n\nthe emails included in Exhibit 5 was recently produced by Enterprise without any legend or other\n\nindication that Enterprise deems it confidential, and that the content of the remaining inter-party\n\nemails included in Exhibit 5 is substantially similar to the email Enterprise produced without any\n\nindication of confidentiality. In her written response, Ms. Stahl stated that Enterprise’s production\n\nof the above-referenced email without any indication of confidentiality was inadvertent; and that\nPLAINTIFF’S SECOND SUPP.

Then,\n\nin a subsequent email to Magellan’s counsel, Ms. Stahl provided an Enterprise-redacted version\n\nof Exhibit 5 in a form said to be “acceptable for filing.” Exhibit C, attached.\n\n             Magellan does not agree that the information contained in the inter-party emails included\n\nin Exhibit 5 constitutes “confidential information” as defined in the audit-related Confidentiality\n\nAgreement. Nor does Magellan agree with Enterprise’s assertions that the audit-related\n\nConfidentiality Agreement precludes Magellan from using or disclosing in this action, for purposes\n\nof pursuing the claims Magellan discovered through its pre-suit audits and alleges in its Original\n\nPetition, any information falling within the Confidentiality Agreement’s definition of “confidential\n\ninformation.” However, to avoid other needless disputes with and threats from Enterprise, and\n\nreserving all rights, Magellan has redacted Exhibit 5 to eliminate any and all arguably “confidential\n\ninformation” including all references to a specific customer, to specific terms of any known\n\nagreement between Enterprise and a customer, to specific product volumes, or to specific contents\n\nof any product transaction data found in spreadsheets Enterprise provided in a pre-suit audit.\n\n             Magellan’s redacted version of Exhibit 5 eliminates much of, but not all of, the same\n\ninformation Enterprise suggested be redacted as “confidential.” Magellan has rejected some of\n\nEnterprise’s redactions because they are unprincipled, inconsistent, and overly broad, including\n\ninformation that cannot conceivably be confidential, such as information of a kind that Enterprise\n\nitself has publicly disclosed and used in this action.\n\n             Dated January 2, 2018.\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S SECOND SUPP.

Enterprise - Exhibit 5 to Plaintiff's Supplement to Response to\n                                   Defendant’s Motion for Entry of Protective Order\n\n\n\nDavid,\n\nThanks for sending the Exhibit 5 materials to me for review. The information contained within these documents is\nconfidential information under the Confidentiality Agreement governing the audit, and will be designated as\nConfidential for purposes of this lawsuit as well. Most have already been withheld on this basis. Each of the documents\nin proposed Exhibit 5 were provided to Magellan in connection with the audit and are non-public materials containing\ncustomer lists, operational information, and business and financial information subject to the protections of the\nAgreement. As such, they must be held in strict confidence and not disclosed to anyone other than representatives of\nMagellan with a legitimate need to review them. Filing the documents of public record violates the terms of the\nConfidentiality Agreement, which Enterprise will not hesitate to enforce by way of injunction or other appropriate relief.\n\nMoreover, under paragraph 5 of the Confidentiality Agreement, Magellan and its Representatives are required to\n“reasonably cooperate with [Enterprise] to assure that, to the extent possible, confidential treatment will be accorded\nto any such Confidential Information or Notes disclosed.” Giving us less than 24 hours’ notice of Magellan’s intent to\nmake Confidential Information public—right before a holiday weekend and without affording us any opportunity to seek\nappropriate relief under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 76a—is not “reasonable cooperation” and would risk only further\nbreach of the Confidentiality Agreement.\n\nAs indicated at the hearing, Enterprise does not object to the Court reviewing the materials in camera in connection with\nthe pending Motion for Entry of Protective Order. By providing the material only for review, the document is not a\n“court record” for purposes of Rule 76a. See General Tire, Inc. v. Kepple, 970 S.W.2d 520, 525 (Tex. 1998).\n\nWith respect to ECO000650-652, the reviewer inadvertently failed to designate this correspondence – which contains\ncustomer information and volume data – as Confidential. The request from Ms. Flock that includes images of portions of\nthe spreadsheet provided in the audit (and which has consistently been withheld from production on confidentiality\ngrounds) appears in several emails, which Enterprise will designate as Confidential upon entry of a Protective Order.\nThese are ECO 000561-563, ECO 000564-566, ECO 000567-570, ECO 000574-576, ECO 000579-581, ECO 000583-585,\n000586-589, ECO 590-593, ECO 000594-597, ECO 000598-601, ECO 000610-613, ECO 614-618, ECO 000633-637, ECO\n000638-642, ECO 000650-652, ECO 000653-656, and ECO 000657-659.\n\nPending entry of that order, the materials continue to be protected by the parties’ Confidentiality Agreement, and\nEnterprise does not consent to filing of these materials publicly.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n                              Linda R.

Enterprise - Exhibit 5 to Plaintiff's Supplement to Response to Defendant’s Motion for\nEntry of Protective Order\n\nLinda,\n\nWhen we filed Magellan’s Supplement to Response to Defendant’s Motion for Entry of Protective Order, late yesterday,\nwe omitted Exhibit 5 pending a determination whether Enterprise believes there’s a need for that Exhibit to be filed\nunder seal. Though I was not present for the hearing this morning, I understand that Mr. Bennett was unable to answer\nthat but indicated you can. So I’m attaching Exhibit 5 and requesting your prompt advice whether Enterprise thinks it\nneeds to be filed under seal. The Exhibit includes 4 email chains, each ending in an email from Ms. Truitt to Ms. Flock. As\nindicated below, the chain ending in Ms. Truitt’s 3/29/16 email was produced by Enterprise but not marked confidential.\nIf you’ve produced the others, please advise, because we couldn’t find them in your production. But their substance is\nsimilar to the one we found in your production.\n\n  10/19/15 Truitt to Flock                              Not produced by ECO\n  03/29/16 Truitt to Flock                              ECO650                                                NOT MARKED CONFIDENTIAL\n  06/24/16 Truitt to Flock                              Not produced by ECO\n  06/19/17 Truitt to Flock                              Not produced by ECO\n\nWe’d like to file Exhibit 5 no later than tomorrow, one way or another, so please let us know today if possible. Thanks.\n\nDavid\n\nDavid L.

A discovery request is overbroad when it covers matters\n\nbeyond those at issue in the case, and a central consideration in\n\ndetermining overbreadth is whether the request could have been more\n\nnarrowly tailored and still obtain pertinent information. In determining\n\nwhether a trial court clearly abused its discretion in regard to a discovery\n\norder, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for the trial\n\ncourt’s, and the relator must show that the trial court could reasonably\n\nhave reached only one decision. Even if that is shown, the relator must\n\nalso show that the remedy afforded by ordinary appeal is inadequate, by\n\nshowing that the discovery burdens the producing party far out of\n\nproportion to any benefit the requesting party may obtain. Has\n\nEnterprise shown that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by\n\nordering discovery pursuant to requests which are truly overbroad, and\n\nif so, has Enterprise shown that it lacks an adequate remedy by ordinary\n\nappeal?\n\n         2.   The party asserting a trade secret privilege as to information\n\nsought in discovery bears the burden to prove that the information is\n\ntrade secret. Information which another party may obtain by proper\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            x\n\fmeans, such as by contractually-authorized audit, cannot constitute a\n\ntrade secret as to that party. Also, under Texas Rule of Evidence 511(a),\n\nany trade secret privilege is waived by voluntary disclosure or consent to\n\ndisclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter, unless such\n\ndisclosure itself is privileged. Even when trade secret status is shown,\n\ndiscovery is appropriate when the requesting party demonstrates that\n\ndiscovery is reasonably necessary for a fair adjudication of the case,\n\nwhich turns on assessment of the particular circumstances. Here, where\n\nEnterprise expressly granted Magellan a contract right to audit and\n\nexamine all records necessary to determine Enterprise’s compliance with\n\nor breach of its contractual obligations to Magellan, and where\n\nEnterprise disclosed to Magellan some but not all information of the\n\nkinds it claims a privilege to withhold as trade secret, did Enterprise\n\nmeet its burden of proof, and if so, did Magellan show reasonable\n\nnecessity for the discovery? Relatedly, did the trial court clearly abuse its\n\ndiscretion by overruling Enterprise’s trade secret objections to production\n\nof the information actually encompassed by Magellan’s requests, or by\n\napproving the form of Protective Order it entered on January 8, 2018?\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           xi\n\f         3.   Magellan’s claims include, among others, breach of contract,\n\nfraud, and promissory estoppel. A court must construe a written contract\n\nin light of all surrounding facts and circumstances, and may consider\n\nthem as an aid in construction even when the court concludes that the\n\nlanguage of the contract is unambiguous. Here, the trial court has denied\n\nmotions in which Enterprise argued that the contract is unambiguous,\n\nbut has made no finding on that issue thus far. Nor has the trial court\n\ndetermined the merits of any claims Magellan asserts, including breach\n\nof contract, fraud, and promissory estoppel. Under these circumstances,\n\ndid the trial court clearly abuse its discretion by compelling Enterprise\n\nto produce any of the information Enterprise characterizes as parol\n\nevidence? And if so, has Enterprise also shown, as required, that such\n\ndiscovery burdens Enterprise far out of proportion to any benefit\n\nMagellan may obtain, such that Enterprise has no adequate remedy by\n\nordinary appeal?\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           xii\n\f                              INTRODUCTION\n\n         The claims Magellan alleges against Enterprise revolve around the\n\nparties’ Crude Oil Distribution Agreement dated October 31, 2011\n\n(“Distribution Agreement”), two related agreements between Magellan\n\nand Enterprise’s co-managed pipeline affiliate, Enterprise Crude\n\nPipeline LLC (“Enterprise Pipeline”), and representations Enterprise\n\nmade to Magellan in connection with those agreements.\n\n         In   the   Distribution   Agreement,   Enterprise   committed   to\n\n“exclusively utilize” Magellan’s Houston area crude oil distribution\n\nfacilities, for ten years, with respect to crude oil Enterprise markets from\n\ncertain “Origin Point” locations in the Eagle Ford Shale to certain\n\n“Destination Points” in the Houston area refining market. Enterprise\n\nmade that long-term commitment for the express purpose of inducing\n\nMagellan, its competitor, to invest heavily in expansion of Magellan’s\n\ndistribution system.\n\n         In reliance on the Enterprise commitment set forth in the\n\nDistribution Agreement, Magellan spent over $20 million to expand and\n\nimprove its distribution facilities as necessary to handle the volumes of\n\ncrude oil expected to be delivered by Enterprise. But instead of delivering\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             1\n\fon its commitment, Enterprise has employed various schemes designed\n\nto circumvent and evade its obligations to Magellan, causing damages\n\nestimated to be $50 million or more to date.\n\n         Magellan bargained for and obtained, in the Distribution\n\nAgreement, the right to periodically audit all records necessary to\n\ndetermine whether and to what extent Enterprise is in compliance with\n\nor in breach of its contractual obligations. On two occasions prior to suit,\n\nMagellan sought to do so, but in each instance Enterprise provided only\n\nsome of the documents and information required for a full audit.\n\nEnterprise claimed any other information regarding its shipments of\n\nEagle Ford crude oil is “irrelevant” to an assessment of contract\n\ncompliance.\n\n         This is because, in Enterprise’s professed view of the Distribution\n\nAgreement, Enterprise’s commitment to exclusively utilize the Magellan\n\ndistribution system is only triggered if and when (1) Enterprise chooses\n\nto retain ownership of crude oil after shipping it from one of the relevant\n\nEagle Ford “Origin Points” specified in the Distribution Agreement, and\n\n(2) Enterprise also chooses to deliver such crude oil to the Magellan\n\n“Connection Point” at Genoa Junction, the location where the\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             2\n\fDistribution Agreement specifies that crude oil must be delivered in order\n\nto enter into Magellan’s Houston area crude oil distribution system. See\n\nMR082-158, Pet., p. 4. In other words, according to Enterprise, the\n\nDistribution Agreement means that Enterprise is not committed to\n\nexclusively utilize Magellan’s facilities at all.\n\n         What is more, as further discussed below, the operating methods\n\nEnterprise claims it is currently using (and may have been using all\n\nalong) frustrate efforts to audit contract compliance because they make\n\nit hard to identify which barrels of crude oil came from a relevant Origin\n\nPoint, and trace where they wound up after Enterprise moved the barrels\n\nto its ECHO Terminal or another intermediate location downstream from\n\nthe Origin Point.\n\n         Shortly after answering Magellan’s Original Petition with a general\n\ndenial, Enterprise filed a summary judgment motion in which it urged\n\nthe trial court to enter judgment against Magellan on all claims, based\n\non Enterprise’s contract interpretation, which it argued is the only\n\nreasonable construction of the contract on its face. In its opposition,\n\nMagellan explained why Enterprise’s interpretation is not the only\n\nreasonable one, and indeed is unreasonable since it turns Enterprise’s\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             3\n\flong-term “commitment” into a unilateral option for Enterprise to use its\n\ncompetitor’s facilities whenever it chooses, rendering the “commitment”\n\nillusory and worthless to Magellan. SR073-340.1 After extensive briefing\n\nand oral argument, the trial court rejected Enterprise’s contention that\n\nits construction of the Distribution Agreement is the only reasonable one,\n\nand thus denied the motion for summary judgment. The trial court\n\ncontemporaneously denied Enterprise’s motion to stay all discovery\n\npursuant to the document production requests Magellan had already\n\nserved on Enterprise, and the document subpoenas it had issued to three\n\nnon-parties, clearing the path for discovery to proceed.\n\n         Undeterred, however, Enterprise refused to produce any documents\n\nrequested by Magellan and filed a second motion to quash Magellan’s\n\nsubpoenas. Following more rounds of briefing and oral argument on\n\nEnterprise’s second motion to quash, and Magellan’s motion to compel\n\nEnterprise, the trial court denied the motion to quash and granted in\n\nmajor part Magellan’s motion to compel. Still undeterred, Enterprise\n\nproduced only the same information previously provided for pre-suit\n\n\n\n1 The supplemental mandamus record is filed with this response and cited as\n“SR001.”\n\n\n{1789105;}                           4\n\faudits, and filed its Petition for Writ of Mandamus seeking relief\n\npreventing the vast majority of the discovery the trial court ordered. On\n\nJanuary 16, 2018, Enterprise filed its Amended Petition for Writ of\n\nMandamus.2\n\n         Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy appropriately reserved for\n\nexceptional cases where the relator demonstrates a clear abuse of the\n\ntrial court’s discretion and the lack of an adequate remedy by ordinary\n\nappeal. Enterprise has made no such showing here. Enterprise grossly\n\nexaggerates the scope of Magellan’s discovery requests to Enterprise and\n\nthe subpoenaed non-parties. In truth, all of them are carefully tailored to\n\nobtain information relevant to the subject matter of the action as alleged\n\nin Magellan’s Original Petition. None of the discovery now compelled or\n\nallowed by the trial court’s discovery orders is overbroad or amounts to\n\nimpermissible discovery of parol evidence.\n\n         In the trial court, Enterprise failed to meet its burden to show that\n\nany information actually responsive to Magellan’s discovery requests, as\n\nwritten, is trade secret information Enterprise could be presumptively\n\n\n\n2 The Amended Petition supersedes the original petition and is hereafter cited as\n“Pet.”\n\n\n{1789105;}                              5\n\fprivileged to withhold from Magellan. It does not, because all such\n\ninformation is within the scope of the audit right Enterprise granted to\n\nMagellan, and thus cannot be kept secret from Magellan. Additionally,\n\nthough it was not required, Magellan showed a reasonable necessity for\n\ndiscovery of responsive information, if any, that might qualify as trade\n\nsecret information outside the scope of Magellan’s audit right.\n\n         In this Court, Enterprise fails to demonstrate that any aspect of the\n\ntrial court’s discovery orders is a clear abuse of the trial court’s broad\n\ndiscretion in matters of discovery, and also fails to show the lack of an\n\nadequate remedy by appeal, as required to warrant mandamus in any\n\ncase.\n\n                          STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n         Magellan is an affiliate of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P., a\n\npublicly traded partnership that primarily transports, stores and\n\ndistributes petroleum products including crude oil. Magellan owns and\n\noperates pipelines and related facilities for transportation and\n\ndistribution of crude oil, including facilities in the Houston, Texas area,\n\nthrough which crude oil is transported and distributed to refineries or\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                              6\n\fother destinations on the Houston ship channel, in Texas City, or at other\n\nlocations on the Texas Gulf Coast. MR001.\n\n         Enterprise is a crude oil marketing company which purchases crude\n\noil from third parties and generates revenues from marketing, storing\n\nand transporting such crude oil in Texas and Oklahoma. As a crude oil\n\nmarketing company, Enterprise purchases crude oil produced by third\n\nparties and ships it on pipelines Enterprise selects, to destinations\n\nEnterprise selects. In Texas, Enterprise purchases and markets crude oil\n\nproduced in, among other regions, the South Texas production region\n\nknown as the Eagle Ford Shale. MR002.\n\n         Enterprise Pipeline, an affiliate of Enterprise, owns or operates\n\nnumerous pipeline facilities in Texas including an Eagle Ford-to-Houston\n\narea pipeline system through which much of the Eagle Ford crude oil\n\nproduction purchased and marketed by Enterprise is transported and\n\nultimately delivered to various Gulf Coast refineries and terminals\n\nincluding ones located along the Houston Ship Channel or in Texas City,\n\nTexas. MR002.\n\n         Enterprise and Enterprise Pipeline, as constituents of Enterprise\n\nProducts Partners L.P. (“EPP”)—which is one of the largest publicly\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            7\n\ftraded midstream energy partnerships in the United States—are jointly\n\nmanaged by Enterprise Crude GP LLC. MR003.\n\nI.       EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN EAGLE FORD PRODUCTION LEADS               TO\n         AGREEMENTS BETWEEN COMPETITORS\n\n         By 2010, midstream energy companies like Enterprise and\n\nMagellan foresaw rapid growth in Eagle Ford Shale crude oil production,\n\nand thus also needs and opportunities for expansions of pipelines and\n\nother midstream distribution systems to move increasing volumes of\n\nEagle Ford crude oil to refining markets in or near Houston. MR007. In\n\n2010, Magellan acquired more than 100 miles of Houston area pipeline\n\nassets that greatly increased its capacity to deliver crude oil to Houston\n\nShip Channel refineries and refineries located in Texas City. MR008. At\n\nabout the same time in 2010, EPP announced plans to construct a large\n\nnew pipeline which would originate in the Eagle Ford Shale and be\n\ncapable of transporting Eagle Ford crude oil to Houston area refining\n\nmarkets by connecting to Enterprise Pipeline’s existing Rancho Pipeline,\n\nwhich extended directly to the Genoa Junction connection point with\n\nMagellan’s Houston area distribution system. MR008.\n\n         In December 2010, Enterprise Pipeline and Magellan entered into\n\nan agreement to combine, under a single transportation tariff, a 40-mile\n\n\n{1789105;}                           8\n\fsegment of Enterprise Pipeline’s Rancho Pipeline with the 26-mile\n\nsegment of Magellan’s Genoa Junction-to-Texas City pipeline. MR012.\n\nEPP’s public announcement noted that this agreement “represents an\n\nimportant first step towards working together on future opportunities\n\ndesigned to improve market access” and “complements our Eagle Ford\n\nShale crude oil strategy that includes Enterprise’s recently announced\n\nplans to construct a new crude oil storage facility and pipelines in\n\nsoutheast Houston that will receive deliveries from the Rancho system\n\nand provide the capability to deliver into the nearby Magellan pipeline.”\n\nMR012.\n\n         The planned “new crude oil facility and pipelines,” which EPP\n\npublicly disclosed to be part of its Eagle Ford crude oil strategy, referred\n\nto (1) the new Enterprise terminal facility known as ECHO Terminal,\n\nlocated approximately three miles southeast of Magellan’s Genoa\n\nJunction connection point, and (2) two new pipelines that would provide\n\nbi-directional transportation of crude oil between ECHO Terminal and\n\nMagellan’s facilities originating at Genoa Junction. MR009-011.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           9\n\fII.      IN 2011, ENTERPRISE AND ENTERPRISE PIPELINE ENTER INTO\n         ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH MAGELLAN FOR DISTRIBUTION OF\n         EAGLE FORD CRUDE OIL TO HOUSTON AREA DESTINATIONS\n\n         During the first half of 2011, as EPP was proceeding to enlarge its\n\nfootprint in the Eagle Ford Shale, Magellan was also considering further\n\nexpansion and improvement of its Houston area crude oil distribution\n\nsystem, subject to securing a long-term contractual commitment assuring\n\nthe commercial viability of such a capital-intensive project. MR013-014.\n\n         Around mid-year, Magellan and Enterprise began exploring a\n\npossible agreement that would benefit both companies by utilizing their\n\ncomplementary assets for marketing, transportation and distribution of\n\nEagle Ford crude oil to Houston area destinations. MR015. At the time,\n\nEnterprise was rapidly growing its business of purchasing crude oil\n\nproduced in the Eagle Ford Shale play and marketing it to refineries in\n\nthe Houston area, whereas Magellan had recently acquired Houston area\n\npipelines and related facilities that increased its capacity to distribute,\n\nto area refineries, crude oil entering into Magellan’s distribution system\n\nat Genoa Junction. See illustrations at MR009, MR012. Notwithstanding\n\nseveral public announcements about its strategic plans to expand its own\n\nfacilities (MR009-012), Enterprise represented to Magellan that\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            10\n\fEnterprise had a need and desire to use Magellan’s Houston area crude\n\noil distribution facilities in order to deliver burgeoning volumes of Eagle\n\nFord production to destinations in the Houston area refining markets.\n\nMR015.\n\n         Following several months of contract negotiations, Magellan\n\nentered into: (1) the Distribution Agreement with Enterprise, (2) the\n\nJoint Tariff Agreement with Enterprise Pipeline, and (3) the Connection\n\nAgreement with Enterprise Pipeline. MR018-022.\n\n         In the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise made a 10-year\n\n“commitment” to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s Houston area crude oil\n\ntransportation and distribution facilities for transportation of certain\n\n“Product”3 Enterprise buys in the Eagle Ford Shale and markets to\n\nHouston area refineries. MR018-019. Specifically, under Section 4.1 of\n\nthe Distribution Agreement, Enterprise committed that for all Product\n\nEnterprise owns or controls at any defined Eagle Ford “Origin Point” and\n\ntransports on its affiliate’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston area pipeline system\n\nfor ultimate marketing (delivery) to any defined Houston area\n\n\n3The Distribution Agreement defines “Product” as “crude oil and condensate meeting\nthe specifications provided for in the Joint Tariff, as such tariff may be supplemented,\namended or reissued from time to time.” MR042.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                11\n\f“Destination Point,” Enterprise would “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s\n\nnew and improved Houston area crude oil distribution system, pursuant\n\nto the agreed “joint tariff” (transportation fee). MR044.\n\n         The   Distribution   Agreement   specifically   referred   to   and\n\nincorporated the Joint Tariff Agreement between Enterprise Pipeline\n\nand Magellan, providing that “[t]ransportation services under this\n\nAgreement are subject to, and the Parties are required to comply with,\n\nthe provisions of the Joint Tariff.” MR041, MR043. The Joint Tariff\n\nAgreement expressed Enterprise’s transportation commitment as\n\nfollows: “[T]he shipper [Enterprise] agrees to ship under the Joint Tariff\n\nall crude owned or controlled by it from an Origin Point through the\n\nConnection Point to a Destination Point.” MR041, MR043.\n\n         To implement the transportation commitment Enterprise made to\n\nMagellan under the Distribution Agreement, it was necessary for\n\nEnterprise Pipeline and Magellan to construct certain new or improved\n\nconnections between their respective distribution systems. So, under the\n\nConnection Agreement, Enterprise Pipeline agreed to construct facilities\n\nwhich would enable it to deliver Product from Enterprise Pipeline’s new\n\nECHO-to-Genoa Junction pipelines into Magellan’s distribution system\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          12\n\foriginating at the Genoa Junction connection point; and Magellan agreed\n\nto construct facilities which would enable it to receive such deliveries\n\nfrom Enterprise Pipeline, at either of the two Genoa Junction\n\ninterconnection points included in the definition of “Connection Point”\n\nset forth in the Distribution Agreement and the Joint Tariff Agreement.\n\nMR021-022.\n\nIII. AFTER INDUCING MAGELLAN TO INVEST HEAVILY IN NEW\n     FACILITIES, ENTERPRISE REFUSES TO UTILIZE THEM AS AGREED\n\n         The Distribution Agreement expressly stated that the purpose of\n\nEnterprise’s long-term commitment to make “exclusive use” of\n\nMagellan’s distribution system was to “facilitate” (i.e., induce) Magellan’s\n\ncostly expansion of its facilities as necessary for Magellan to handle the\n\nEagle Ford crude oil transportation business Enterprise committed to\n\nMagellan. MR039. Following execution of the parties’ 2011 agreements,\n\nand in reliance upon them, Magellan invested over $20 million to\n\nconstruct the “New Magellan Facilities” described in the Distribution\n\nAgreement, and did all of the connection work necessary to receive the\n\nanticipated Enterprise deliveries of Product from Enterprise Pipeline’s\n\nRancho Pipeline and ECHO-to-Genoa Junction pipelines into Magellan’s\n\nexpanded Houston area distribution system originating at Magellan’s\n\n\n{1789105;}                          13\n\fGenoa Junction Connection Point with those pipelines. MR023.\n\nMagellan’s facilities were connected and capable of receiving Enterprise\n\nProduct at the specified Genoa Junction Connection Point as of July 1,\n\n2013, the duly noticed “In-Service Date” on which Enterprise’s 10-year\n\ncommitment to “exclusively utilize” the Magellan facilities began.\n\nMR023.\n\n         However, from the In-Service Date to the present, Enterprise has\n\nfailed and refused to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s facilities in\n\naccordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement. MR024.\n\nAlthough the parties disagree about the meaning of the transportation\n\ncommitment Enterprise made in the Distribution Agreement, and thus\n\nthe scope of Eagle Ford Product covered by Enterprise’s obligation to\n\nmake exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities, there is no dispute that from\n\nthe In-Service Date to present Enterprise has purchased and marketed\n\nhundreds of millions of barrels of Eagle Ford Product which were not\n\ntransported through Magellan’s Houston area distribution system to a\n\nspecified Destination Point. MR029.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           14\n\fIV.      ENTERPRISE REBUFFS MAGELLAN’S ATTEMPTS TO AUDIT\n         ENTERPRISE PURSUANT TO MAGELLAN’S CONTRACT AUDIT RIGHTS\n\n         No rational company in Magellan’s position would invest tens of\n\nmillions of dollars to expand and improve its facilities, on the strength of\n\na major competitor’s long-term contractual commitment to exclusively\n\nutilize those facilities (in lieu of, for example, similar facilities the\n\ncompetitor owns or has publicly announced its intention to develop),\n\nwithout obtaining a robust right to audit the competitor as necessary to\n\nfully determine and fully verify the competitor’s compliance with or\n\nbreach of its commitment. Magellan bargained for and obtained that very\n\nright.\n\n         In Section 4.4 of the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise agreed\n\nthat “Magellan shall have the right to audit Shipper’s records necessary\n\nto verify Shipper’s compliance with the provisions of Section 4.1\n\n[the         transportation   commitment]   and    4.2   [transportation\n\ncommitment exceptions].” MR045 (emphasis added). This bargained-\n\nfor audit right is quite broad, and necessarily so. For one thing, under\n\nSection 4.1 of the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise (the Shipper) not\n\nonly committed itself to “exclusively utilize” the Magellan Facilities but\n\nalso committed to “use best efforts to cause Shipper’s Affiliates [e.g.,\n\n\n{1789105;}                           15\n\fEnterprise Pipeline] to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities.”\n\nMR044. In addition, Enterprise’s transportation commitment hinges on\n\ncertain variables, such as: whether and what “Product” the Shipper, or\n\nan “Affiliate” of the Shipper, either owns or controls, at an Eagle Ford\n\n“Origin Point;” whether such Product is transported on the “Enterprise\n\nPipeline” or some other pipeline; and whether and to what extent such\n\nProduct is transported for ultimate delivery to any “Destination Point.”\n\nMR044. Consequently, properly auditing and verifying compliance with\n\nor breach of such a commitment is an inevitably complex process which\n\ncould and does require access to and examination of many different types\n\nand sources of documents and data which Enterprise maintains in or\n\nthrough methods and systems unknown or unfamiliar to Magellan, and\n\nwhich can change over time.\n\n         Under such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that Enterprise\n\nvoluntarily granted Magellan such a broadly-worded right to audit.4 Nor\n\nis it surprising, although it is important, that the audit right Enterprise\n\n\n\n4 Although Section 4.4 of the Distribution Agreement is titled “Magellan’s Limited\nRight to Audit and Penalty,” the stated limitations concern only the timing, location,\nand costs of audits, not the scope of the information Magellan is entitled to examine\nfor purposes of auditing Enterprise’s compliance with its transportation commitment\nto Magellan. See MR045.\n\n\n{1789105;}                               16\n\fexpressly granted Magellan does not exclude or exempt from audit any\n\nparticular types or categories of documents or information, such as\n\ndocuments or information Enterprise may deem to be confidential or even\n\n“trade secret.” What is surprising, and alarming, is how Enterprise\n\nresponded to Magellan’s two pre-suit attempts to audit Enterprise’s\n\ncontract compliance, and how (as discussed below) it has responded to\n\nMagellan’s requests for discovery in this action.\n\n         In the spring of 2015, Magellan sought its first contract compliance\n\naudit. This audit revealed that immediately after Enterprise signed the\n\nDistribution Agreement with Magellan, Enterprise began replacing its\n\nEagle Ford marketing contracts—under which Enterprise controlled or\n\nwould control Product distribution and delivery from end-to-end of the\n\ntransport from Origin Point to Destination Point—with buy-sell\n\ncontracts, under which Enterprise buys volumes of crude oil at the Origin\n\nPoint, transports it to Enterprise’s ECHO Terminal, and resells the same\n\nvolumes to the same customers once the crude oil reaches ECHO\n\nTerminal. MR026. The first audit also revealed other operating methods\n\nEnterprise uses to complicate tracing and fully accounting for the\n\ntransportation and ultimate delivery of all Eagle Ford Product\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            17\n\fEnterprise owns or controls at an Origin Point. For example: (1)\n\nEnterprise batches a common stream barrel at the Origin Point and\n\nresells a common stream barrel at a downstream destination such as\n\nECHO Terminal, but says it does not tie the barrels Enterprise owns at\n\nthe Origin Point to the barrels it resells to the same customer at the\n\ndownstream location;5 and (2) Enterprise says that after reselling Eagle\n\nFord barrels to a customer at ECHO Terminal or another intermediate\n\nlocation downstream from the Origin Point, Enterprise does not track the\n\ncustomer’s subsequent transportation to a Destination Point or any other\n\nfinal destination. MR090-091, MR243, SR378, SR489-533.6\n\n         For Magellan’s first audit, Enterprise provided only part of the\n\ninformation needed to fully audit its compliance with or breach of the\n\nDistribution Agreement, e.g., only three of its Eagle Ford buy-sell\n\n\n\n5 As Enterprise puts it: “Crude is not segregated at ECHO based on the crude’s origin;\nit is aggregated there based on quality with crude from various sources, and there is\nno way to determine whether any particular batch of crude purchased at\nECHO was produced from an Origin Point.” SR378 (emphasis added).\n6 However, Enterprise has also made assertions inconsistent with the above. For\ninstance, it has claimed that certain barrels were delivered through Enterprise\nfacilities (not Magellan facilities) based on transportation nominations made by\nEnterprise’s customers, and that some Product was transported by a customer from\nECHO Terminal to a designated Destination Point, but not through the Magellan\nfacilities, allegedly because that was “not the most direct routing” (which, even if true,\ndoes not exempt the barrels from Enterprise’s commitment). SR489-533.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                 18\n\fcontracts (and only one of the related marketing contracts replaced with\n\nthe buy-sell contract), and only certain incomplete or indecipherable\n\ntransactional reports regarding Eagle Ford Product Enterprise owned or\n\ncontrolled at an Origin Point and transported to its ECHO Terminal.\n\nMR322.\n\n         In 2017, Magellan attempted a second audit, regarding Enterprise’s\n\ncontract compliance during 2016. For purposes of this audit, Magellan\n\nrequested records which, in light of what was learned through the first\n\naudit, were plainly required in order to thoroughly and completely audit\n\nand determine the extent of Enterprise’s compliance or breach of its\n\nobligations under the Distribution Agreement. This included complete\n\ntransactional data regarding transportation and delivery of Eagle Ford\n\nProduct Enterprise owned or controlled at an Origin Point (not any\n\nother Enterprise-owned crude oil) and records showing whether\n\nEnterprise replaced its pre-Distribution Agreement Eagle Ford\n\nmarketing contracts with post-Distribution Agreement buy-sell contracts\n\nfor good faith business reasons or in a bad faith effort to evade its\n\nobligation to make exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities. MR353-356.\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            19\n\f         In response, Enterprise provided essentially the same kinds of\n\ntransaction data (for 2016 Product shipments) it had provided for\n\nMagellan’s first audit, with the same limitations and gaps preventing\n\nMagellan from identifying and tracing the transportation and delivery of\n\nall volumes of crude oil Enterprise owned or controlled and transported\n\nfrom an Eagle Ford Origin Point to a final destination beyond ECHO\n\nTerminal or a similar intermediate location. Enterprise also refused to\n\nprovide any of its other Eagle Ford marketing agreements, buy-sell\n\nagreements, or transportation agreements. MR322.\n\n         The reason Enterprise gave for refusing to provide Magellan with\n\nall records “necessary to verify Shipper’s compliance” was not that any\n\nsuch records constitute “trade secrets” that, despite the broad audit right\n\nEnterprise granted in the Distribution Agreement, Enterprise is\n\nprivileged to withhold from Magellan. MR322. In fact, although\n\nEnterprise provided information under a confidentiality agreement—one\n\nthat permits the information to be reviewed by any Magellan\n\nrepresentative who has “a legitimate need to review and evaluate the\n\nConfidential Information to assist Recipient [Magellan] in connection\n\nwith the Audit” and permits Magellan to use Confidential Information\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           20\n\ffor any “purposes related to the Audit” (MR468)—Enterprise never\n\nclaimed (and still does not claim) that any of the “Confidential\n\nInformation” it actually provided for audit is Enterprise “trade secret”\n\ninformation. MR319, MR322. Instead, based on the same erroneous\n\ninterpretation     of   the   Distribution   Agreement   that   Enterprise’s\n\nsubsequent motion for summary judgment unsuccessfully urged the trial\n\ncourt to adopt as a matter of law, Enterprise claimed that the rest of the\n\ninformation Magellan sought for audit is simply irrelevant.\n\nV.       ENTERPRISE ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK ALL MAGELLAN DISCOVERY IN\n         THE ACTION\n\n         On June 19, 2017, Magellan filed its factually detailed 36-page\n\nOriginal Petition, alleging claims for (among other things) breach of the\n\nDistribution Agreement, promissory estoppel, and fraud. MR001-078.\n\nShortly after Enterprise answered with a general denial (MR079-081),\n\nMagellan served its first document requests to Enterprise (MR271) and\n\nissued subpoenas to the three non-parties who were counterparties to the\n\nthree Eagle Ford buy-sell contracts Enterprise disclosed during\n\nMagellan’s first audit (MR196-236). The requests to Enterprise sought\n\ndocuments relevant to the subject matter of the action, including\n\ndocuments relevant to Enterprise’s liability for all claims alleged in the\n\n\n{1789105;}                            21\n\fOriginal Petition, and to a determination of Magellan’s damages. The\n\nnon-party subpoenas sought all relevant “Eagle Ford Product” 7 contracts\n\nwith Enterprise (including those Enterprise claimed not to have),\n\nrelevant communications with Enterprise regarding those contracts, and\n\nthe non-parties’ own basic transactional data regarding the purchase,\n\nsale, transportation and delivery of Eagle Ford Product sold to Enterprise\n\nat an Origin Point and/or bought back from Enterprise pursuant to a buy-\n\nsell contract. SR341-366.\n\n         Enterprise then launched, and for five months has maintained, a\n\nwithering campaign to stop Magellan’s suit in its tracks, without any\n\nmeaningful discovery from Enterprise or anyone else. Specifically,\n\nEnterprise: (1) sought summary judgment on all of Magellan’s claims,\n\nbased on Enterprise’s faulty interpretation of the Distribution\n\nAgreement (MR082-158) (motion denied); (2) moved to stay all discovery\n\npending determination of its summary judgment motion (SR001-072)\n\n\n\n7 The non-party subpoenas clearly and carefully defined “Eagle Ford Product,” to be\nlimited to crude oil and/or condensate the non-party sold to Enterprise, or delivered\nto Enterprise for transportation, at one of the Eagle Ford Origin Points specified in\nthe Distribution Agreement. Ironically, Enterprise scoffs that this and other\ndefinitions Magellan included in its subpoenas or its requests to Enterprise—all of\nwhich were carefully designed to avoid confusion or overbreadth—were “made-up” by\nMagellan. Pet., pp. 7, 12.\n\n\n{1789105;}                               22\n\f(motion denied); (3) after those two motions were denied, (a) objected to\n\nevery one of Magellan’s discovery requests and refused to produce\n\nanything to Magellan (MR287), and (b) filed another motion to quash the\n\nnon-party subpoenas (MR160-236) (motion denied); (4) opposed\n\nMagellan’s motion to compel Enterprise to produce documents responsive\n\nto Magellan’s requests (MR390-473) (motion granted in major part); (5)\n\non the eve of the hearing on Magellan’s motion to compel, served\n\namended objections and responses in which Enterprise asserted new\n\nobjections and substantially altered others (SR426-516) (objections\n\noverruled); (6) moved for entry of a protective order containing draconian\n\nprovisions that, unlike the audit-related Confidentiality Agreement\n\ndiscussed above, would preclude any Magellan personnel from reviewing\n\nany information Enterprise is compelled to produce but claims is trade\n\nsecret or “highly confidential” (MR474-575); and (7) filed its Petition for\n\nWrit of Mandamus.\n\n         Enterprise’s relentless efforts to prevent this case from moving\n\nforward have failed, and with good reason. The trial court’s rulings to\n\ndate—though not yet effective in breaking Enterprise’s unilateral\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           23\n\fembargo on discovery—have been well-considered and lawful, and by no\n\nmeans an abuse of discretion in any respect.\n\n                              ARGUMENT\n\nI.       ENTERPRISE HAS NOT SHOWN ANY RIGHT TO MANDAMUS RELIEF\n         ON THE GROUND THAT THE TRIAL COURT COMPELLED DISCOVERY\n         PURSUANT TO OVERBROAD REQUESTS\n\n         Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 192.3 entitles a party to obtain\n\ndiscovery “regarding any matter that is not privileged and is relevant to\n\nthe subject matter of the pending action,” whether or not the information\n\nwill be admissible at trial, as long as the information sought “appears\n\nreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(a). The phrases “relevant to the subject matter” and\n\n“reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence” are liberally\n\nconstrued to allow litigants to obtain the fullest knowledge of the facts\n\nand issues prior to trial.

And importantly, “an appellate\n\nremedy is not inadequate merely because it may involve more expense or\n\ndelay than obtaining an extraordinary writ.” Id. To establish inadequate\n\nremedy, the party seeking mandamus relief from a discovery order\n\ncompelling production must prove that the order “compels the production\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           27\n\fof patently irrelevant or duplicative documents, such that it clearly\n\nconstitutes harassment or imposes a burden on the producing party far\n\nout of proportion to any benefit that may obtain to the requesting\n\nparty.” Id. at 843 (emphasis added). In other words, contrary to\n\nEnterprise’s contention, even proof that a discovery order compels\n\nproduction of “patently irrelevant” documents (which Enterprise has not\n\nshown)       does   not   automatically     satisfy   the    inadequate      remedy\n\nrequirement; the relator must also demonstrate that the order\n\nconstitutes harassment or burdens the producing party far out of\n\nproportion to the benefit to the requesting party.8\n\n\n8 Enterprise relies (Pet., p. 20) on a quotation from In re CSX Corp. that for such an\norder, there is no adequate remedy on appeal “because the order ‘imposes a burden\non the party far out proportion to the benefit that may obtain to the requesting\nparty.’” In re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d at 153 (emphasis added) (citing and internally\nquoting Walker). But Walker does not support the view that any order compelling\nproduction of “patently irrelevant” documents necessarily imposes such a burden far\nout of proportion to the benefit. Rather, Walker shows, and logically so, that in such\ncases the assessment of adequate remedy involves a case-by-case balancing of\ndemonstrated burden versus benefit. In In re CSX Corp., the burden far outweighed\nthe benefit because the plaintiff’s interrogatories at issue sought names and\naddresses of all safety personnel the defendants employed over a 30-year period,\nextending 25 years beyond the plaintiff’s employment period.

NONE OF MAGELLAN’S REQUESTS                  TO   ENTERPRISE   ARE\n               OVERBROAD\n\n         Enterprise leads its argument by pointing to Magellan’s Request\n\nNo. 10—which it says “typifies the overbreadth” (Pet., p. 22) of Magellan’s\n\nrequests—asserting that the documents sought have “no apparent\n\nconnection” to the issues in the case. (Pet., p. 23). That is plainly wrong.\n\n         Magellan       alleges   that,        consistent    with    Enterprise’s\n\nrepresentations, the Enterprise transportation commitment set forth in\n\nthe Distribution Agreement applies to all Product (crude oil and\n\ncondensate) which is owned by Enterprise at any of the defined Origin\n\nPoints, transported on its Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system, and\n\ndelivered to any of the defined Destination Points in the Houston area\n\nmarket. MR001. Based on information it discovered through pre-suit\n\naudit, Magellan also alleges that Enterprise is deliberately skirting its\n\ncontractual commitment, in various ways (e.g., replacing pre-contract\n\nmarketing agreements with post-contract buy-sell agreements, and\n\nidling its Rancho I pipeline and using its Rancho II pipeline to bypass the\n\nMagellan’s Connection Point9) which not only breach the contract but\n\n\n\n\n9   See SR074 for illustration.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                29\n\falso indicate that Enterprise never intended to perform its obligation to\n\n“exclusively utilize” Magellan’s Houston area distribution system\n\noriginating at the Genoa Junction Connection Point.\n\n         Request No. 10 calls for Enterprise business plans, projections,\n\nstatistics and the like regarding its marketing, transportation or delivery\n\nof “Eagle Ford Product” only, i.e., only Product which Enterprise owns or\n\ncontrols at a specified Origin Point and is subject to the transportation\n\ncommitment contained in the Distribution Agreement. Enterprise’s\n\ncomplaint that Request No. 10 references items pertaining to marketing\n\nor delivery of Eagle Ford Product to ECHO Terminal, Genoa Junction, or\n\nother Houston Area Destinations is unfounded, and ironic, because such\n\nspecific references reasonably limit the scope of the request so that it does\n\nnot seek information pertaining to any Eagle Ford Product that does not\n\nmove to Houston on the Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline and, therefore,\n\nis not subject to the Distribution Agreement. The requested information\n\nis also reasonably limited to the time period during which Distribution\n\nAgreement has been in effect.\n\n         Documents responsive to Request No. 10 are highly relevant to\n\nmultiple issues in the case, such as: whether Enterprise misled Magellan\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           30\n\fabout Enterprise’s purported need, desire, and intent to make exclusive\n\nuse of Magellan’s facilities; whether Enterprise ever planned or expected\n\nto do so; whether, at the time Enterprise induced Magellan to invest in\n\nexpanded facilities and new connections between the competitors’\n\nrespective facilities, Enterprise was already using or planning to use\n\noperating methods designed to evade its commitment and/or frustrate\n\nMagellan’s ability to audit compliance with that commitment; and\n\nwhether, when and why Enterprise’s needs, plans or expectations\n\nchanged after it signed the Distribution Agreement (e.g., whether\n\nchanges were made in order to evade the transportation commitment,\n\nwhich the law forbids (see MR253)).\n\n         Next, Enterprise contends that Request Nos. 17-23 are overbroad\n\nbecause they seek information about “every customer contract for Eagle\n\nFord Crude.” (Pet., p. 24). That is also incorrect. First, given the scope-\n\nlimiting definitions used, all of these requests pertain only to contracts\n\ncovering crude oil or condensate purchased, sold or transported from one\n\nof the Origin Points identified in the Distribution Agreement. Second,\n\nthey are all reasonably limited in time, to the period from 2011 (when\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          31\n\fEnterprise began entering into the marketing agreements it later\n\nreplaced with buy-sell agreements) to present.\n\n         Documents responsive to Request Nos. 17-23 are relevant to the\n\nsame issues and matters discussed above, in particular whether the\n\ncontracts resulted from customer demands (as Enterprise claims, see\n\nMR090-091, SR489-533) or from Enterprise’s own bad faith attempts to\n\nstructure deals so as to evade its commitment to make exclusive use of\n\nMagellan’s facilities, and instead promote the use of Enterprise’s\n\nfacilities. Enterprise acknowledged the relevance of such contracts when\n\nit provided three buy-sell agreements and one of the related marketing\n\nagreements it replaced with a buy-sell agreement.\n\n         Last, Enterprise claims that Request Nos. 24-26 and 28-29 are\n\noverbroad on the ground that they seek information about “Future\n\nDestination Points” (a term defined in the Distribution Agreement) “that\n\nMagellan has never put into service.” (Pet., p. 24). However, Enterprise\n\nhas not proved that assertion, and cannot because it is false. It is true\n\nthat Request Nos. 28-29 seek information about crude transportation\n\nfrom ECHO Terminal to any Destination Point or Future Destination\n\nPoint, but do not tie that to barrels which came from an Origin Point.\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                          32\n\fHowever, that is only because Enterprise states that the barrels it\n\ntransports from an Origin Point are being batched, are not tied or\n\nmatched to the barrels it resells at ECHO Terminal, and thus cannot be\n\nspecifically identified or traced from ECHO Terminal to the ultimate\n\ndelivery point. MR090-091, MR243, SR378, SR489-533. In this\n\ncircumstance, the information sought by Request Nos. 28-29 is obviously\n\nrelevant to identify and quantify, by some appropriate means, the\n\nProduct Enterprise should have delivered through Magellan’s facilities.\n\n         None of Enterprise’s arguments about overbreadth and abuse of\n\ndiscretion are valid, and all of the cases Enterprise relies on are factually\n\ndistinguishable.

Magellan has shown a reasonable expectation of\n\nobtaining substantial benefit from the compelled discovery. By contrast,\n\nEnterprise has not given this Court any specifics showing that\n\ncompliance will impose a significant burden on Enterprise, much less one\n\n“far out of proportion” to the benefit Magellan may gain.\n\n         B.    NONE OF THE SUBPOENAS ARE OVERBROAD\n\n         Enterprise’s argument about alleged overbreadth of Magellan’s\n\nsubpoenas to the three non-parties mostly just rehashes the same invalid\n\narguments refuted above.\n\n         Magellan’s subpoenas contain the same scope-limiting definitions\n\nused in Magellan’s requests to Enterprise, so the subpoenas only seek\n\ninformation about crude oil and condensate sold at or transported from\n\none of the relevant Origin Points, and only during the period relevant to\n\nthe case.\n\n         The   requested   contracts    with   Enterprise,   and   related\n\ncommunications with Enterprise, are relevant to the issues in the case,\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             34\n\ffor the same reasons discussed above. Each subpoena also requests the\n\nnon-party’s own transactional data, as available, showing what Eagle\n\nFord Product was purchased, sold or delivered under those agreements,\n\non what terms, and how and where the barrels were transported to a final\n\ndestination. That information is relevant to determine whether\n\nEnterprise provided incentives aimed at steering product transportation\n\naround Magellan’s distribution system, and to quantify the extent of\n\nEnterprise’s breach of its commitment to exclusively utilize Magellan’s\n\nfacilities. And obtaining the non-party’s own transactional data is\n\nnecessary, especially since Enterprise claims not to know or be able to\n\ndetermine how or where the barrels were delivered to a final destination\n\nafter Enterprise transported them from an Origin Point to ECHO\n\nTerminal and then sold them back to the non-party.\n\n         Enterprise offers no proof of any significant duplication between the\n\ndocuments the subpoenaed non-party must provide (if available) and\n\nthose Enterprise is compelled to provide (if available). In fact, Enterprise\n\nhas said it does not have all of the relevant contracts with the non-parties\n\nand probably does not have much of the related inter-party\n\ncommunications (MR240, MR371-372, MR376-377), and by definition,\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             35\n\fEnterprise does not have the non-party’s transactional records. In any\n\nevent, the possibility of some duplication, depending on what Enterprise\n\nmay eventually produce, does not render the subpoenas overbroad.\n\n         Neither are the subpoenas overbroad merely because they do not\n\nidentify the non-party custodians whose records may need to be searched.\n\nMagellan has no way to know who the relevant custodians are. The only\n\ncase Enterprise cites as support for its assertion that the subpoenas are\n\n“facially unreasonable and overbroad” for failure to identify custodians\n\nand supply email search terms (Pet., p. 26), does not even address any\n\nsuch issue. See In re Nat’l Lloyds Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2016)\n\n(orig. proceeding).\n\n         Moreover, neither Enterprise nor any subpoenaed non-party has\n\nshown that Magellan’s subpoena imposes on the non-party a heavy\n\nburden that far outweighs the benefit to Magellan.\n\nII.      THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY\n         OVERRULING ENTERPRISE’S “TRADE SECRETS” OBJECTION\n\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled\n\nEnterprise’s trade secret objections to Magellan’s discovery requests,\n\nbecause: (1) all discovery the trial court compelled Enterprise to produce\n\nis within the scope of Magellan’s contract audit right because it is\n\n\n{1789105;}                          36\n\freasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent\n\nEnterprise has breached the Distribution Agreement, and thus cannot\n\nconstitute trade secret information Enterprise is privileged to withhold\n\nfrom Magellan; (2) in any event, Enterprise made no prima facie showing\n\nthat any particular information responsive to Magellan’s requests is a\n\ntrade secret; (3) Enterprise waived any trade secret protection as to all\n\ncompelled discovery; and (4) though not required, Magellan established\n\nthat all compelled discovery is material and necessary for a fair\n\nadjudication of Magellan’s claims, including its fraud claim as well as its\n\nbreach of contract claim.\n\n         A.

See MR287.12\n\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling\n\nEnterprise’s trade secrets objections, because all 20 of the requests at\n\nissue seek information which, like the limited information Enterprise\n\nprovided during Magellan’s pre-suit audits, is also reasonably necessary\n\nto determine whether and to what extent Enterprise has breached the\n\nDistribution Agreement. The compelled discovery is within the scope of\n\nMagellan’s bargained-for right to audit Enterprise and, therefore, cannot\n\nconstitute trade secret information Enterprise is privileged to withhold.\n\n         This includes requests for documents pertaining to the terms of the\n\ncontracts between Magellan and Enterprise or Enterprise Pipeline\n\n(Request Nos. 1-3); the reasons why Enterprise and its affiliate pursued\n\nthe contracts with Magellan (Request Nos. 4-6); and Enterprise’s plans,\n\n\n12  Enterprise did not assert, in its original responses (MR287) or its amended\nresponses (SR461), a trade secret objection to Request No. 32, the request for\ndocuments Enterprise provided to Magellan in connection with Magellan’s audits.\nThe only other requests to which Enterprise did not object on trade secret grounds\nwere Nos. 7-9 (authorizations to enter into the agreements between Magellan and\nEnterprise or Enterprise Pipeline); No. 11 (inter-party communications about those\nagreements); Nos. 12-16 (Enterprise documents commenting on the meaning or effect\nof, or referring to, the parties’ agreements); Nos. 30-31 (inter-party communications\nand Enterprise internal communications regarding Magellan’s audits; and No. 33\n(documents supporting Enterprise’s credit/offset defense).\n\n\n{1789105;}                               41\n\fgoals, projections, etc. regarding the marketing or transportation of its\n\nEagle Ford Product to its ECHO Terminal, Magellan’s Genoa Junction\n\nconnection, or other Houston area destinations (Request No. 10). The\n\ncontents of those documents reflect circumstances surrounding the\n\nDistribution Agreement, which may properly inform as to the intent and\n\nmeaning of the contract, and thus are pertinent to evaluation of contract\n\ncompliance or breach.\n\n         Magellan’s right to audit also encompasses marketing, buy-sell, and\n\ntransportation agreements pertaining to Eagle Ford Product, between\n\nEnterprise and an affiliate or a customer (e.g., other agreements of the\n\ntype Enterprise previously provided), related communications between\n\nthe contracting parties, and other documents showing which party\n\ninitiated the contract discussions and why (Request Nos. 17-23). All such\n\ninformation is necessary to evaluate whether the agreements were made\n\nfor good faith business reasons, or in a bad faith effort to evade\n\nEnterprise’s obligation to make exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities,\n\nwhich the law forbids. See MR253.\n\n         Information within the scope of Magellan’s audit right also includes\n\nany transactional reports and data available to Enterprise, which permit\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            42\n\fidentification,     quantification,   and   tracing   of   the   ownership,\n\ntransportation, distribution and ultimate delivery of Eagle Ford Product\n\nEnterprise owned or controlled at any designated Origin Point (Request\n\nNos. 24-26, 28-29). Magellan’s need for such information results, in no\n\nsmall part, from the operating methods Enterprise has adopted with\n\nrespect to ownership, transportation and delivery of the Product it owns\n\nat an Origin Point—methods like batching Product at the Origin Point,\n\nselling it back to the producer before it reaches Magellan’s distribution\n\nsystem, not tying or tracking an Origin Point barrel to a barrel sold at an\n\nintermediate location such as ECHO Terminal, and allegedly failing to\n\ntrack further transportation to any final destination including a\n\ndesignated Destination Point.\n\n         In essence, Enterprise is using methods which allow it to claim that\n\nthe Product Enterprise owns at an Origin Point is not covered by the\n\nexclusive-use commitment set forth in the Distribution Agreement\n\nbecause the Product loses its identity and enters a black box once\n\nEnterprise transports it to its ECHO Terminal and resells it to the\n\nproducer. To fully and fairly audit and evaluate contract compliance or\n\nbreach, Magellan is entitled to examine all available documents which\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            43\n\fmay enable it not only to identify and quantify 100% of the Product\n\nvolumes Enterprise owned at an Origin Point, but also to trace how and\n\nwhere all such Product was ultimately delivered. It is preposterous for\n\nEnterprise to contend, as it does, that all Magellan really needs to know\n\nis the volume of Product Enterprise owned at an Origin Point and the\n\nvolume Enterprise transported through Magellan’s distribution system\n\nto a designated Destination Point.\n\n         In sum, none of the information the trial court compelled Enterprise\n\nto produce can qualify as an Enterprise trade secret, at least not as to\n\nMagellan, because all of it falls within the scope of Magellan’s contract\n\naudit right and is not secret at all.\n\n         C.     IN ANY EVENT, ENTERPRISE PRESENTED NO PRIMA FACIE\n                PROOF THAT ANY INFORMATION RESPONSIVE TO\n                MAGELLAN’S DISCOVERY REQUESTS IS TRADE SECRET, AS\n                REQUIRED\n\n         As its “proof” that the information Magellan seeks from Enterprise\n\nand/or        the   subpoenaed   non-parties   is   Enterprise   trade   secret\n\ninformation, Enterprise relies entirely on the Affidavit of Brent Secrest,\n\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                              44\n\fdated August 10, 2017 (“Secrest Aff.”).13 But that affidavit falls far short\n\nof sufficient proof.\n\n         The Secrest Affidavit is fundamentally flawed not only because it\n\nfails to address the impact of the audit right Enterprise expressly granted\n\nto Magellan, but also because it fails to show that any specific\n\ninformation actually responsive to Magellan’s discovery requests would\n\nqualify as trade secret in the absence of Magellan’s audit right. Although\n\n¶ 10 of the Secrest Affidavit recites the factors relevant to a trade secret\n\ndetermination, none of the factors can be evaluated or applied in a\n\nvacuum, without identification of the specific information in question.\n\nThat is, the specified factors presuppose that the party claiming trade\n\nsecret protection from discovery has identified “the information” actually\n\nat issue. Indeed, Enterprise effectively concedes this burden of proof\n\nwhen it states that “[o]nce Enterprise establishes that the information\n\n\n\n13 Although the Secrest Affidavit is titled “Affidavit of Brent Secrest in Support of\nEnterprise Crude Oil, LLC’s Motion for Protective Order,” is dated the same date\n(August 10, 2017) that Enterprise filed its first motion for protective order/stay of\ndiscovery, and makes assertions in language virtually identical to that motion,\nEnterprise did not submit the affidavit at that time. Enterprise submitted this\naffidavit in support of its October 18, 2017 Amended Motion to Quash (MR160), its\nNovember 28, 2017 Response to Magellan’s Motion to Compel (MR390), and its\nNovember 28, 2017 Motion for Entry of a Protective Order Governing the Production\nof Confidential Information (MR474).\n\n\n{1789105;}                               45\n\fMagellan is demanding is trade secret, such information cannot be\n\nproduced until Magellan establishes that such information is necessary\n\nfor a fair trial.” Pet., p. 27-28 (emphasis added). But Enterprise made no\n\nsuch showing. This is why Enterprise’s argument—that the Secrest\n\nAffidavit proves its trade secret claim—finds no support in the lone case\n\nEnterprise cites on this point, In re Union Pac. R.R.

R. R. Co. was a train wreck case where the plaintiff claimed injury\nfrom inhaling chlorine gas released when Union Pacific’s train failed to stop at a\nsignal, collided with another train, and derailed, releasing toxic chlorine gas. The\nplaintiff alleged that the railroad should have positioned the chlorine car farther\ntoward the rear of the train. In discovery, the plaintiff sought disclosure of three years\nof specific rates Union Pacific charged for handling the shipping customer’s chlorine\nchemicals as compared to the rates it charged for handling non-hazardous materials.\nThe Supreme Court noted that a trial court must first determine “whether the\nrequested production constitutes a trade secret,” and that the issue for decision was\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion by ordering Union Pacific to produce\n“confidential ‘rate structures’ which include formulas to determine shipping rates\ncharged to customers.” 294 S.W.2d at 590, 591 (emphasis added). Unlike Enterprise,\nUnion Pacific provided two affidavits specifically “explaining why this rate\ninformation” constituted a trade secret. Id. at 592. For that reason, and because the\nplaintiff did not dispute that the requested rate structures were trade secrets, the\nSupreme Court concluded that Union Pacific had established its trade secrets claim.\nId. On its facts and its face, In re Union Pac. R. R. Co. does not support Enterprise’s\nargument that “parties with as (or less) detailed affidavits have obtained relief to\nprotect their trade secrets.” Pet., p. 32.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                 46\n\fflawed) approach in its quest to block discovery on trade secret grounds.\n\nFirst, before the trial court, and even here, Enterprise makes sweeping\n\nassertions to the effect that virtually all of its business information is\n\ntrade secret, except to the extent Enterprise decided to disclose it in\n\nMagellan’s audits.15 Second, Enterprise falsely claims that Magellan’s\n\ndiscovery requests to Enterprise and the subpoenaed non-parties must\n\ninvade Enterprise’s trade secret information because they encompass\n\nvirtually    all   such    confidential     business      information—e.g.,       that\n\nMagellan’s requests seek “detailed information about the entirety of\n\nEnterprise’s crude oil business in Eagle Ford and South Texas” (MR478,\n\nemphasis added), its “business plans, proposals, goals, projections,\n\nbudgets, estimates, statistics, and histories for its entire Gulf Coast\n\noperations” (Pet., p. 9, emphasis added), “Enterprise’s full playbook of\n\ntrade secrets for the Gulf Coast region” (Pet., p. 16, emphasis added); and\n\n“nearly every document concerning Enterprise’s Gulf Coast operations”\n\n(Pet., p. 29, emphasis added). Third, bootstrapping on such false claims,\n\n\n\n\n15For example, in its Petition Enterprise asserts that all of its “confidential business\ninformation” constitutes “Enterprise’s trade secrets ... which Enterprise has spent\nmany years developing... .” Pet., p. 13. This can also be seen in Enterprise’s trade\nsecret objection to the great majority of Magellan’s requests.\n\n\n{1789105;}                                47\n\fEnterprise asserts that the Secrest Affidavit proved that “the breadth of\n\nMagellan’s requests and customer subpoenas necessarily seek discovery\n\nof Enterprise’s trade secrets.” Pet., pp. 28-30. In reality, the Secrest\n\nAffidavit contains four short paragraphs that merely parrot Enterprise’s\n\ngross mischaracterizations of the scope of Magellan’s requests, never\n\nspecifically identifying a single request, much less explaining how the\n\ninformation actually sought by that request is trade secret. MR407.16\n\n         This explains why Enterprise’s fallback argument is that all the\n\ninformation it seeks to withhold qualifies as trade secret in combination\n\nor compilation. See Pet., p. 29.

R. R. Co., the Court found a failure to show reasonable\nnecessity, but the case is clearly distinguishable on its facts. There, the plaintiff\nclaimed she needed discovery of certain Union Pacific rate structures, to rebut the\nrailroad’s claim that placing hazmat rail cars in the back of the train would be cost-\nprohibitive, and to argue that higher rates for hazardous materials handling were an\nacknowledgment of a greater duty to take precautions. But two considerations led the\nCourt to conclude that the plaintiff had failed to show reasonable necessity. First,\nUnion Pacific admitted that it was financially able to reposition the railcars, so\ndiscovery of specific rates was unnecessary to rebut the railroad’s “cost-prohibitive”\nargument. Second, Union Pacific admitted that it charged higher rates to ship\nhazardous materials versus non-hazardous materials. Therefore, said the Court, “it\nis unclear to us, and [plaintiff] has not explained, why she needs the specific rate\nstructures to advance this negligence theory.” Id. at 593 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n{1789105;}                               52\n\fdiscover information Enterprise refused to provide for audit, including\n\ninformation showing where all of the Eagle Ford Product Enterprise\n\nowned at an Origin Point was ultimately delivered, how it was\n\ntransported to those destinations, and why Enterprise did not utilize\n\nMagellan’s facilities.

And none of that\n\nmaterial information is available from another source.19\n\n         Due to extensive motion practice, briefing, and arguments on the\n\nmerits of the case as well as the discovery issues, the trial court is steeped\n\nin the context of the case and the nature of the information material and\n\nnecessary to the litigation. Thus, the trial court was in the best position\n\nto weigh the conflicting evidence and determine whether Enterprise\n\nsufficiently proved any valid trade secret privilege—including whether,\n\nunder Tex. R. Evid. 507(a), no such privilege exists because “non-\n\ndisclosure will tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work injustice”)—and\n\neven if so, whether Magellan also showed reasonable necessity for the\n\ndiscovery. And there is simply nothing to support Enterprise’s argument\n\n\n\n\n19Cf.

The\n\nProtective Order strikes an appropriate balance between the parties’\n\ncompeting interests in discovery of any trade secret information,\n\nproviding more than adequate protection for any real trade secret\n\ninformation that Enterprise, Magellan, or any non-party may produce.\n\n         Enterprise’s objections to the Protective Order concern its\n\nrestrictions on review of Enterprise-produced “Attorneys Eyes Only”\n\n(“AEO”) information by Magellan’s in-house counsel, or by Enterprise’s\n\nown current or former employees, and the purported risk associated with\n\nsuch review. None of those objections have merit.\n\n         The Protective Order strictly limits access to any confidential or\n\ntrade secret information. As Enterprise requested, the trial court ordered\n\ntwo-tiered protection allowing any producing party or non-party to\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            55\n\fdesignate any “Classified Information” as either “Confidential” or AEO.\n\nSR534-535. The only Magellan representatives authorized to see any\n\nAEO information produced by Enterprise or a non-party are: (1)\n\nMagellan’s outside counsel in this case; (2) Magellan in-house counsel\n\nwho (a) manage litigation, (b) are actively involved in assisting\n\nMagellan’s outside counsel in this action, and (c) do not make or\n\nparticipate in competitive business decisions; (3) Magellan auditors who\n\n(a) are actively involved in assisting Magellan’s outside counsel in this\n\naction, and (b) do not make or participate in competitive business\n\ndecisions; and (4) independent experts or consultants. Id. Before they can\n\nsee any AEO information, any qualified in-house counsel, auditors, and\n\nexperts/consultants must also sign a document agreeing to be bound by\n\nthe Protective Order, which also provides that recipient’s use of AEO or\n\nany other “Classified Information” produced by another party or non-\n\nparty must be “solely for” this litigation and “for no other purpose.”\n\nSR538. Thus, the Protective Order is far more restrictive than the\n\nparties’ audit-related confidentiality agreement which, as noted above,\n\nallowed the same kinds of information to be reviewed by any Magellan\n\nrepresentative with a “legitimate need.” MR468.\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                         56\n\f         It is true that for eligible in-house counsel who may review another\n\nparty’s AEO information, the Protective Order does not disqualify them\n\nfrom participating in business decisions for a specified period after this\n\nlitigation is concluded. See Pet., p. 39. However, Enterprise conveniently\n\nfails to mention that it never sought such a limitation on in-house\n\ncounsel. To the contrary, in fact, Enterprise forcefully advocated against\n\nit. MR837. Enterprise is in no position to reverse course and claim, before\n\nthis Court, that the trial court abused its discretion by “failing” to require\n\nthat in-house counsel avoid participation in any business decisions for a\n\nspecified time following this litigation.\n\n         In any event, Enterprise provides no support for its argument that\n\naccess by Magellan’s in-house litigation counsel carries a significant risk\n\nthat Magellan will inadvertently disclose or deliberately misuse AEO\n\ninformation, in violation of the Protective Order. Brent Secrest’s latest\n\naffidavit, dated December 21, 2017, contains certain general assertions\n\nabout “flat” organizational structures and associated risks that\n\ninformation learned by an in-house attorney will be disclosed or used in\n\nviolation of a court’s protective order. See MR728-729. As it relates to\n\nMagellan, however, Mr. Secrest’s assertions and conclusions are sheer\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            57\n\fspeculation; he does not even claim to have any personal knowledge\n\nabout Magellan’s in-house litigation counsel or Magellan’s internal\n\nstructures and processes. Id. Mr. Secrest’s affidavit also mischaracterizes\n\nthe pending proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory\n\nCommission (“FERC”), and speculates that information Magellan’s in-\n\nhouse counsel learn through discovery in this unrelated case will\n\ninevitably “bleed over” into the FERC proceeding. MR729. That\n\nassertion, which impugns the integrity and professional ethics of\n\nMagellan’s in-house counsel, is baseless and false.\n\n         Equally specious is Enterprise’s claim that the Protective Order\n\nlacks adequate protection with respect to Enterprise-produced AEO\n\ninformation that may be shown to Enterprise’s own current or former\n\nemployees. See Pet., pp. 39-40. The Protective Order permits AEO\n\ninformation to be disclosed only to certain of Enterprise’s current or\n\nformer employees, and only under certain conditions. Specifically, under\n\nparagraph 2(a)(iv), only those current or former Enterprise employees\n\nwho are “reasonably believed to have knowledge or information relevant\n\nto the litigation” may see Enterprise-produced AEO information; for\n\nformer employees, the person must have been employed by Enterprise\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           58\n\fwhen the information was generated; and all current and former\n\nemployees must sign a document agreeing to be bound by the Protective\n\nOrder. SR535.\n\n         In all probability, the only Enterprise employees who have relevant\n\nknowledge, and thus will be eligible to see Enterprise-produced AEO\n\ninformation, are or were senior executives or managerial-level personnel\n\nin Enterprise’s crude oil marketing business. By Enterprise’s admission,\n\nall of those people have or had access to the kinds of business information\n\nEnterprise is compelled to produce pursuant to Magellan’s requests. In\n\nhis affidavit dated August 10, 2017, Brent Secrest testified that “[n]o one\n\noutside of Enterprise’s senior executives and the crude marketing\n\ngroup have access to comprehensive business and strategic information”\n\nof the type Magellan seeks to discover. MR178 (emphasis added).\n\nTellingly, none of Mr. Secrest’s affidavits identify a single current or\n\nformer employee who is knowledgeable about the case and is someone\n\nwho does not or did not have access to Enterprise’s “comprehensive\n\nbusiness and strategic information.” In other words, all of Enterprise’s\n\nassertions about its internal compartmentalization of sensitive business\n\ninformation are misleading diversions. Enterprise has never asserted\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            59\n\f(much less proved) that any sensitive business information sought by\n\nMagellan is or ever was off-limits to any current or former employee who\n\nmay be a witness in this case.\n\n         Enterprise also mischaracterizes the competing interests that must\n\nbe appropriately balanced in a protective order. First, Enterprise\n\nunderstates Magellan’s interest in discovery of Enterprise’s business\n\nplans, methods and practices regarding marketing and delivery of\n\nProduct Enterprise purchases and moves from an Eagle Ford Origin\n\nPoint. Magellan’s interest is not merely a “highly generalized” (Pet., p.\n\n39) interest in prosecuting its claims. Rather, for all the reasons\n\ndiscussed above, the discovery at issue goes to the heart of Magellan’s\n\nclaims for breach of contract and fraud, and quantification of damages\n\ndespite      Enterprise’s   attempts   to   camouflage   relevant   Product\n\nmovements to the point they become untraceable and unauditable.\n\n         Second, Enterprise greatly overstates any “competitive harm” it\n\ncould conceivably suffer in the highly unlikely event any of the few\n\nMagellan attorneys or Enterprise employees who may review its so-called\n\n“trade secret” information—none of which is actually trade secret vis-a-\n\nvis Magellan—were to use or disclose it in direct violation of the\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             60\n\fProtective Order they will have committed (in writing) to follow. The\n\ntruth is that before this suit was filed, Enterprise provided to Magellan,\n\nwithout the strict protections contained in the Protective Order, much of\n\nwhat Enterprise now claims to be trade secret information regarding its\n\ncrude oil marketing and transportation agreements, methods and\n\npractices. See SR493-511. In addition, Enterprise’s public filings in this\n\naction describe those agreements, methods and practices in substantial\n\ndetail. See MR082-158. Given all of the allegedly confidential information\n\nEnterprise has publicly disclosed, or provided for review by any Magellan\n\nemployee with a “legitimate need,” its claims about the “competitive\n\nharm” that could result from unauthorized use or disclosure of any other\n\ninformation Enterprise must produce—which, of course, the Protective\n\nOrder strictly prohibits—is not credible and provides no basis to conclude\n\nthat the trial court committed an abuse of discretion.\n\n         Finally, none of the cases Enterprise cites support its position that\n\nthe Protective Order constitutes a clear abuse of the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion in light of the facts of this case and the competing interests to\n\nbe balanced. Every case Enterprise relies on turned on its own peculiar\n\nfacts, and involved discovery of highly sensitive if not ultra-sensitive\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                             61\n\finformation where the potential harm was different in kind and more\n\nserious in nature than any present here, and where the risk of improper\n\ndisclosure was not purely speculative (as it is here).20 Enterprise’s cases\n\ndo not, either individually or collectively, establish any immutable rule\n\nthat a protective order must include any protections more stringent than\n\nthose contained in the Protective Order the trial court entered in this\n\ncase.\n\n         Indeed, many courts have approved protective orders containing\n\nthe same or lesser protections than those found in this Protective Order.\n\nSee, e.g., Life Techs.

THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR, OR ABUSE ITS DISCRETION, BY\n     COMPELLING DISCOVERY OF ANY INFORMATION ENTERPRISE\n     LABELS AS “PAROL EVIDENCE”\n\n         Enterprise’s “parol evidence” assault on the trial court’s order\n\ncompelling production responsive to Magellan Request Nos. 1-6 and 12-\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                           63\n\f16 hinges entirely on its argument that the Distribution Agreement is\n\n“facially unambiguous.” Pet., p. 41. This is the very same argument,\n\npractically verbatim, that Enterprise made in its unsuccessful motion for\n\nsummary judgment. See MR082-158.\n\n         In that motion, Enterprise argued that there is only one reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the 10-year commitment it made in the Distribution\n\nAgreement—that Enterprise is obligated to make exclusive use of\n\nMagellan’s distribution facilities only if Enterprise chooses to retain\n\nownership of its Eagle Ford crude oil at all times and places along its\n\ntransport from an Origin Point to a Destination Point and Enterprise also\n\nchooses to deliver the crude to Magellan’s Connection Point on its\n\nway to a Destination Point. See MR082. But as Magellan explained to the\n\ntrial court in its opposition to Enterprise’s summary judgment motion,\n\nEnterprise’s interpretation renders illusory the commitment it made for\n\nthe express purpose of inducing Magellan to invest heavily in expansion\n\nand improvement of its distribution system, is inconsistent with the\n\noverall purpose of the contract, and certainly is not the only reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the contract language when read in context and as a\n\nwhole. See SR073.\n\n\n\n{1789105;}                            64\n\f         Although the trial court denied Enterprise’s summary judgment\n\nmotion following extensive briefing and oral argument (MR159), nothing\n\nin the record supports Enterprise’s assertion (Pet., p. 42) that the trial\n\ncourt has finally determined whether the Distribution Agreement is or is\n\nnot ambiguous as it relates to Enterprise’s commitment. What is clear is\n\nthat the trial court rejected Enterprise’s argument that the only\n\nreasonable interpretation of the Distribution Agreement, on its face, is\n\nthe one Enterprise advocates.\n\n         Given the applicable rules of contract construction, it is clearly\n\nwithin a trial court’s discretion to permit discovery into the facts and\n\ncircumstances surrounding a contract before the court decides whether\n\nthe contract is ambiguous, or what it must or may mean. A court must\n\nconstrue a written agreement in light of all the surrounding facts and\n\ncircumstances. See First Bank v.

If, as Enterprise\n\ncontends (but Magellan disputes), the Distribution Agreement does not\n\nembody the promise Magellan alleges Enterprise actually made\n\nregarding exclusive use of Magellan’s facilities, Magellan has a claim for\n\npromissory estoppel.

For example, Enterprise’s heavy reliance on Nat’l Union\n\nFire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. CBI Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742633/nat-union-fire-ins-v-cbi-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\n\n1995) is misplaced. The court in CBI Indus. specifically held that\n\n“[e]xtrinsic evidence may, indeed, be admissible to give the words of a\n\ncontract a meaning consistent with that to which they are reasonably\n\nsusceptible, i.e., to ‘interpret’ contractual terms.” Id. at 521. Based on the\n\nunique facts of that case, the trial court simply concluded that the record\n\nwas sufficiently developed to warrant summary judgment, and the\n\nappellate court affirmed. Id. at 522. See Ford Motor Co., 279 S.W.3d at\n\n664 (Tex. 2009) (noting that discovery was unnecessary in CBI Industries\n\nbecause “the facts in [that case] were sufficiently developed and all the\n\nrelevant information was at hand” (alterations omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)). Here, though, the trial court was within its\n\ndiscretion to find the contrary and permit discovery to proceed.\n\n         None of the other cases Enterprise relies on were decided in a\n\ndiscovery context, and all of them involved actual consideration of\n\nevidence similar to what Magellan seeks to discover.

This motion is brought pursuant to Rule 192.6 of the Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure, and to give effect to Rule 1 which provides that the objective of the rules is to\n\nobtain a just, fair, equitable and impartial adjudication of the rights of the parties with as great\n\nexpedition and dispatch and the least expense to the parties.\n\n                             I.     SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n       This Court should issue an Order staying discovery pending resolution of the threshold\n\nlegal issues raised in Enterprise’s Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment filed on August 4,\n\n2017. Enterprise’s summary judgment motion argues that the plain and unambiguous language\n\nof the parties’ agreement precludes all of Magellan’s claims a matter of law. Because the Court\n\nneed not and indeed cannot consider any extraneous evidence in determining the threshold legal\n\nissue raised in Enterprise’s motion for summary judgment, discovery at this juncture is\n\nunnecessary, premature and would only serve to increase the burden and expense of litigation.\n\n\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

Indeed, the sensitive business information Magellan seeks from both Enterprise in its\n\nRequests for Production and from Enterprise’s customers in Magellan’s third-party subpoenas\n\nshow that Magellan’s discovery requests are not meant to discover relevant facts, but rather to\n\nharass and impose undue burdens on Enterprise and its customers in an attempt to improve\n\nMagellan’s bargaining position in the case. The Court should therefore enter an order protecting\n\nEnterprise from having to respond to Magellan’s requests and quash the non-party subpoenas.\n\n                         II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n           Enterprise and Magellan are parties to a Crude Oil Distribution Agreement1 that provides\n\nas follows:\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The Distribution Agreement is Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s Original Petition.\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

Consistent with the plain language of the Distribution\n\nAgreement, Enterprise has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building its own crude oil\n\ndistribution assets.\n\n        Beginning in 2015, Magellan commenced a series of audits seeking to force Enterprise to\n\ndivulge its customer information and other data unnecessary to confirm payment of the agreed\n\ntariffs for crude meeting the criteria set out in the Distribution Agreement. Magellan’s rights to\n\naudit under the Distribution Agreement are limited to documents necessary to determine whether\n\nbarrels subject to the agreement have been treated properly. Thus, the only information\n\nEnterprise was required to provide Magellan was documentation sufficient to show the\n\ndisposition of crude that came from an Origin Point up to the time when it ceased to be Owned\n\nor Controlled by Enterprise. As to any crude that Enterprise Owned or Controlled from Origin\n\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

As\n\nthe audit progressed, it became apparent that although the Distribution Agreement specified\n\nprecise criteria for what crude was subject to the Distribution Agreement, Magellan’s position\n\nwas that the criteria set out in Section 4.1 should be disregarded in favor of a supposed “intent”\n\nexpressed nowhere within the four corners of the contract. To that end, Magellan demanded that\n\nEnterprise provide every contract or title transfer document for all product Enterprise owned at\n\nany Origin Point, and that Enterprise include all details about the transferee, the date and place of\n\ntransfer, and volumes. Magellan then demanded that Enterprise identify all volumes shipped\n\nfrom any Origin Point on systems other than the Eagle Ford pipeline, as well as detailed\n\nexplanations of other systems Enterprise used to transport crude, as well as the reasons those\n\nsystems were used.3\n\n         The parties continued with the audit of years 2014 and 2015 for several months, and on\n\nJune 6, 2017, Magellan commenced an audit for year 2016. By this time, Magellan had already\n\ninstituted the dispute resolution procedure set out in the Distribution Agreement. Thereafter, on\n\nJune 19, 2017, Magellan filed the instant lawsuit alleging breach of contract, reformation,\n\ndeclaratory judgment, promissory estoppel, and fraud.4\n\n         Enterprise maintains that the Distribution Agreement means only what the parties agreed\n\nit says: that crude starting at an Origin Point that goes through the Connection Point must travel\n\n2\n  See Def.’s Mot. for S.

It seeks communications and drafts of\n\nagreements between Enterprise and its customers, revealing Enterprise’s negotiating strategies\n\nwith respect to the same customers Magellan seeks.

ARGUMENT\n\nA.     The Court Should Stay all Discovery Until it Resolves the Threshold Issue of\n       Whether the Parties’ Agreements Are Unambiguous.\n\n       Because the resolution of a pending, threshold issue of contractual interpretation stands to\n\ndispose of the entire case and moot any need for factual discovery, the Court should enter an\n\norder staying all discovery until that threshold issue is resolved. Indeed, this case turns on a\n\npurely legal issue of contract interpretation and the discovery Magellan seeks is unnecessary to\n\nresolve this question. Trial courts have been given “broad discretion to schedule and define the\n\nscope of discovery,” and should “limit discovery when ‘the burden or expense of the proposed\n\ndiscovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in\n\ncontroversy, the parties’ resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the\n\nimportance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.’” Id. (quoting Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n192.4(b)). Such discovery limitations are especially appropriate pending resolution of important\n\nthreshold issues that may moot the need for further discovery, such as jurisdictional issues, id.; or\n\nissues of contract interpretation, see, e.g., Nat’l Union Fire Ins.

This information constitutes trade secrets\n\nbelonging to Enterprise. For example, the requests seek information about transportation and\n\ndistribution of crude oil to any “Future Destination Point” – facilities it is undisputed that\n\nMagellan never constructed.11 In their totality, the requests would require Enterprise to disclose\n\nits entire distribution network and pricing structure, 12 and lay open all of its customer\n\narrangements in the region.13\n\n         The particulars of Enterprise’s business plans and strategies, the terms of its contracts,\n\nand the routing of product through its distribution system are not known outside the business,\n\nexcept for the individual participants in a transaction. No one outside of Enterprise has a 360-\n\ndegree view of the company’s operations, which is what Magellan seeks here.

The Court Should Protect Enterprise from Magellan’s Subpoenas to Enterprise\n           Customers Containing Unduly Burdensome and Duplicative Requests.\n\n           While the discovery rules are intended to make litigation fair, the pragmatic reality is that\n\ndiscovery is often used as “a weapon capable of imposing large and unjustifiable costs on one’s\n\nadversary.” In re Alford Chevrolet-Geo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419858\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419858/in-re-alford-chevrolet-geo/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180 (Tex. 1999) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).

For all the reasons stated above, a protective\n\norder is warranted.\n\n       Protection is additionally warranted as to the subpoenas because Enterprise’s customers\n\nare strangers to this litigation. A party causing a subpoena to be served is required to take\n\nreasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on the entity served. TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n176.7.

Indeed, the Texas rules require subpoenas to be\n\ncurtailed if the discovery sought is: (i) unreasonably cumulative or duplicative; (ii) obtainable\n\nfrom some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; or (iii) the\n\nburden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. See TEX. R. CIV.

Magellan’s third-party subpoenas suffer from at least three of the infirmities\n\nlisted in Rule 192.4.\n\n       What is more, the requests are duplicative and seek information obtainable from another\n\nsource – i.e., Enterprise.   A responding party is entitled to a protective order if a party’s\n\ndiscovery requests require “the production of patently irrelevant or duplicative documents, such\n\nthat it clearly constitutes harassment or imposes a burden on the producing party far out of\n\nproportion to any benefit that may obtain to the requesting party.” Walker v.

Instead of first attempting to obtain the information from\n\nEnterprise, Magellan’s served subpoenas containing identical request for production to\n\nEnterprise’s non-party customers. The fact that Magellan seeks the very same information from\n\nEnterprise as it does from these non-parties demonstrates that the information may be obtained\n\nfrom a less burdensome source. Accordingly, the Court should issue an order quashing the non-\n\nparty subpoenas until Enterprise has been given a full opportunity to object and respond to the\n\nsame requests for production, which in any event should be after the Court has resolved\n\nEnterprise’s pending motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                     IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the Court need not consider any extraneous evidence apart from the parties’\n\nunambiguous agreement in resolving this dispute, all discovery should be stayed until the Court\n\nhas resolved the threshold issue raised in Enterprise’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\nMoreover, despite the requirements that discovery requests be reasonably tailored to include only\n\nrelevant matters and not used to fish for information, Magellan served facially overbroad and\n\notherwise improper discovery requests on Enterprise and its customers that seek far more\n\ninformation than is relevant and fits the needs of this case. The Court should therefore enter a\n\nprotective order absolving Enterprise of its burden to respond to Magellan’s improper requests,\n\nand quash the non-party subpoenas.\n\n\n\n\nDEF.’S MOT.

(“Magellan”) submits this response\n\nin opposition to the no-evidence Motion for Summary Judgment (“Motion”) filed by Defendant\n\nEnterprise Crude Oil LLC (“Enterprise”) on August 4, 2017. This case arises from the parties’\n\nCrude Oil Distribution Agreement dated October 31, 2011 (“COD Agreement”), in which\n\nEnterprise made a 10-year “commitment” to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s Houston-area\n\ndistribution facilities in connection with the transportation of crude oil from the south Texas\n\nEagle Ford Shale play to certain destinations in Houston and the Texas gulf area. However\n\nEnterprise has purposely refused to honor that commitment. As a result, Magellan alleges breach\n\nof contract, fraud, and other related claims against Enterprise, and seeks an estimated $50 million\n\nor more in damages suffered to date.\n\n             Based primarily on a faulty, unreasonable interpretation of the COD Agreement,\n\nEnterprise asks this Court to determine all claims, on the merits, against Magellan, barely three\n\nmonths after the suit was filed and before Magellan has had any discovery whatsoever. The\n\nMotion should be denied, because Enterprise’s arguments are meritless, and its no-evidence\n\nMotion is premature and improper in any event.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 1\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               SR73\n\f                                       I.    SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n             The COD Agreement at the center of the case contains Enterprise’s express 10-year\n\n“commitment” to exclusively utilize Magellan’s Houston-area crude oil transportation and\n\ndistribution facilities for transportation of crude oil Enterprise that buys in the Eagle Ford Shale\n\nand markets to Houston-area refineries. The COD Agreement expressly states that Enterprise\n\nmade its long-term exclusive-use commitment to induce Magellan’s costly expansion of its\n\nfacilities, including (among other things) installation of new connections between the two\n\ncompanies’ respective pipelines, as necessary for Magellan to handle the Eagle Ford crude oil\n\ntransportation business Enterprise committed to Magellan.\n\n             Enterprise admits that it has not exclusively utilized Magellan’s facilities since they were\n\ncompleted and placed in operation four years ago, and admits that it has attempted to avoid its\n\ncontractual obligation by purposely circumventing the Magellan facilities in the very ways\n\nalleged in Magellan’s Original Petition,1 such as by:\n\n             (i)    moving Enterprise-owned Eagle Ford crude oil on a new segment of the Eagle\n                    Ford-to-Houston pipeline, which no longer extends directly to Magellan’s\n                    facilities (Rancho I) but skirts around the Magellan connection (Rancho II) and\n                    runs straight to Enterprise’s ECHO Terminal just beyond the Magellan connection\n                    (as depicted below):\n\n\n\n\n1\n   See Original Petition ¶¶ 52-60. Until it has discovery, Magellan will not know whether Enterprise has\ncircumvented Magellan in other ways, too.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 2\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            SR74\n\f                    and\n\n             (ii)   at Enterprise’s ECHO Terminal, selling the crude oil back to the same customer\n                    who sold the crude oil to Enterprise at one of the Eagle Ford Origin Points—\n                    pursuant to a buy-sell agreement which was made after the COD Agreement and\n                    which replaced an Enterprise crude oil purchase-only agreement (i.e., a\n                    marketing agreement) in place before the COD Agreement.\n\n             Specifically, Enterprise argues that under Section 4.1 of the COD Agreement, its\n\n“commitment” to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s facilities is “conditioned” upon certain\n\ncircumstances or events that have never occurred, namely (i) Enterprise’s continuous ownership\n\nor control of crude oil from end-to-end of the transport from an “Origin Point” (as defined) to a\n\n“Destination Point” (as defined), and (ii) Enterprise’s delivery of the crude oil to Magellan’s\n\nGenoa Junction “Connection Point” (as defined). Of course, those matters are within Enterprise’s\n\nexclusive control. Nevertheless, Enterprise claims that the “plain language” of the COD\n\nAgreement permits Enterprise to guarantee that the purported “conditions” never occur, and\n\nthereby avoid the commitment it made to Magellan. That is not what Section 4.1 says or may\n\nreasonably be interpreted to mean. Furthermore, under the well-established law discussed below,\n\nEnterprise is prohibited from avoiding its commitment in this manner..\n\n             For the Motion to succeed, as to Magellan’s claim for breach of contract, Enterprise must\n\ndemonstrate that its interpretation of the COD Agreement is correct as a matter of law—that the\n\ncontract is unambiguous and subject to no other reasonable interpretation. It cannot do so. By\n\nlaw, the contract language at issue must be read and construed in light of the surrounding\n\ncircumstances and purposes of the contract, taking into account the whole agreement, and\n\navoiding if possible any construction that would make other provisions meaningless or make a\n\nparty’s promise illusory. Also, for summary judgment purposes, all reasonable inferences must\n\nbe drawn in favor of the non-movant (Magellan). When the COD Agreement is construed\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 3\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR75\n\faccording to these well-settled rules, Enterprise’s view of the meaning and intent of the language\n\nused in the “transportation commitment” section (Section 4.1) of the COD Agreement is not\n\nreasonable, and certainly is not the only reasonable interpretation.\n\n             First, the language in Section 4.1 which Enterprise characterizes as a “condition” upon its\n\nobligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities—the words “provided, that such\n\ndeliveries … are … transported to the Connection Point”—do not constitute a “condition” upon\n\nEnterprise’s transportation commitment to make exclusive use of the Magellan facilities. Rather,\n\nthose words merely identify the specific location (the Magellan “Connection Point” at Genoa\n\nJunction) where Enterprise agrees to deliver crude into Magellan’s distribution system in\n\nfulfillment of the commitment to make exclusive use of the “Magellan Facilities” as defined. In\n\nother words, that language constitutes an Enterprise covenant, not a condition precedent to\n\nEnterprise’s obligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities.\n\n             Second, the COD Agreement contains no express requirement that Enterprise must\n\ncontinuously own or control the crude oil, from end-to-end of the transport from an Eagle Ford\n\n“Origin Point” (as defined) to a Houston-area “Destination Point” (as defined), for Enterprise’s\n\ntransportation commitment to apply. Viewing the agreement in its entirety, as required, strongly\n\nsupports Magellan’s position that Enterprise’s ownership or control of the crude at any Eagle\n\nFord Origin Point is sufficient to satisfy the ownership/control requirement.\n\n             Third, even if Enterprise’s interpretation of Section 4.1 were correct, the Motion would\n\nfail. Under settled contract law, Enterprise cannot avoid its transportation commitment by\n\npurposely causing any “conditions” within its control not to occur, whether by deliberately\n\nbypassing the Magellan Connection Point, by manipulating crude ownership/control downstream\n\nfrom an Origin Point where the crude was owned or controlled by Enterprise, or by other means.\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 4\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           SR76\n\fThis is true regardless of whether, as Enterprise contends, the COD Agreement is similar to an\n\n“output/requirements” contract; the applicable contract law is the same.\n\n             Similarly, Enterprise is not entitled, at this early stage, to summary judgment on any of\n\nthe four other claims alleged in Magellan’s Original Petition. Enterprise’s attack on those claims\n\nis largely founded on its erroneous interpretation of the COD Agreement and thus fails for the\n\nreasons noted above. In any event, all of those claims are viable, justiciable, and supported by\n\ncurrently available evidence and reasonable inferences sufficient to withstand the Motion.\n\n             Finally, but importantly, the Enterprise Motion is a no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment that is premature and improper, because Magellan has had no discovery, let alone the\n\n“adequate time for discovery” that Rule 166a(i) requires. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). All of\n\nEnterprise’s arguments are misguided and wrong on the merits, so denial of the Motion here and\n\nnow is appropriate. However, if the Court were inclined to believe that there could be some\n\nmerit in an argument made in the Motion, then pursuant to Rule 166a(g) the Court should defer\n\nany ruling and continue the Motion as needed to give Magellan adequate time and opportunity to\n\nconduct discovery essential to resolution of the Motion—discovery Enterprise has thus far\n\nblocked.\n\n                   II.    RESPONSE TO MOVANT’S STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS\n\n             Many of the assertions in Enterprise’s statement of undisputed “facts” are legal\n\narguments, contentions or conclusions, not facts. Magellan responds to such legal contentions\n\nand conclusions in its argument below. To the extent the Enterprise statement asserts actual facts\n\nnot specifically disputed below, Magellan reserves all rights to dispute at trial (after adequate\n\ndiscovery) the truth, relevance and/or admissibility of such facts.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 5\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR77\n\f             1.   Paragraph 5: Magellan disputes Enterprise’s legal conclusion as to what the “plain\n\nlanguage” of the COD Agreement means.\n\n             2.   Paragraphs 6-10: To the extent these paragraphs accurately reflect the express\n\nterms of the COD Agreement, Magellan does not dispute them. However, Magellan disputes all\n\nEnterprise characterizations of the contract’s express terms and their meaning or effect.\n\n             3.   Paragraph 14: This is a statement of law, not fact. To the extent facts are stated,\n\nMagellan disputes Enterprise’s assertion that the consideration for Magellan’s work and services\n\nconsisted of a mere commitment by Enterprise to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities\n\nin lieu of using the facilities owned by other non-Enterprise parties and originating at or near the\n\nlocation known as Genoa Junction. As shown on the face of the COD Agreement, the material\n\nconsideration Magellan bargained for (and got) was Enterprise’s promise to exclusively use\n\nfacilities owned by Magellan, not those owned by anyone else including Enterprise or its\n\naffiliates, to move Eagle Ford crude oil from any Origin Point to any Destination Point as those\n\nterms are defined in the COD Agreement.\n\n             4.   Paragraph 15: This statement is misleading. At the time Enterprise and Magellan\n\nentered into the COD Agreement, Magellan was considering whether to build the New Magellan\n\nFacilities. To the extent Enterprise’s statement suggests that even without Enterprise’s long-term\n\nexclusive use commitment, Magellan would have invested the many millions of dollars it did\n\ninvest to expand its Houston-area crude oil distribution system as described in the COD\n\nAgreement, the statement is false.\n\n             5.   Paragraph 16: Magellan disputes this statement. Enterprise has not “performed as\n\nrequired.” To the extent any Eagle Ford crude that Enterprise owned at an Origin Point has ever\n\nmoved on the Magellan Facilities, it was not transported on the Magellan Facilities “pursuant to”\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 6\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR78\n\fthe COD Agreement. Since September 2013, Enterprise has purchased and marketed an\n\nestimated 175,000,000 barrels (or more) of Eagle Ford crude oil to Houston-area destinations,\n\nyet none of those barrels were transported to or through the Magellan Facilities pursuant to and\n\nas required by the COD Agreement. Enterprise has not gone out of business, nor has it ceased\n\nshipping crude oil from the Origin Points to the Destination Points. Rather, it has merely decided\n\nto use other facilities—especially its own facilities—to move its Eagle Ford crude oil between\n\nOrigin Points and Destination Points. This is a clear breach of Enterprise’s exclusive-use\n\ncommitment to Magellan.\n\n             6.   Paragraph   19:   Magellan    disputes   all   legal   conclusions   and    factual\n\ncharacterizations in paragraph 19. Magellan agrees with Enterprise’s assessment of the utility of\n\nECHO Terminal. The utility of this facility was not lost on Magellan. Indeed, that is precisely\n\nwhy Magellan insisted on Enterprise’s firm commitment that it would use the Magellan\n\nFacilities, not its own, for all crude oil deliveries from any Origin Point to any Destination Point.\n\n             7.   Paragraph 20: Magellan disputes this statement. Although this statement may\n\nhave some truthful elements, without the benefit of the discovery to which it is entitled,\n\nMagellan cannot adequately assess the truth or otherwise respond to Enterprise’s assertions.\n\n             8.   Paragraph 21: This is a conclusion of law, not a statement of fact. To the extent\n\nfacts are stated, Magellan disputes Enterprise’s assertion that the COD Agreement permits\n\nEnterprise to defeat its performance obligation either by refusing to deliver crude to the Magellan\n\nConnection Point or by manipulating ownership of crude downstream from an Origin Point\n\nwhere Enterprise owned it. Not only does the COD Agreement, construed as a whole, prohibit\n\nsuch conduct, but well-settled law prohibits Enterprise from engaging in such conduct. At the\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 7\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR79\n\fvery least, Enterprise’s own statements raise issues that would require discovery before its\n\nassertions could be validly tested and addressed, thus precluding summary judgment.\n\n             9.    Paragraph 22: Magellan does not dispute that Enterprise publicly disclosed its\n\nconstruction of the Rancho II pipeline, and Magellan does not claim to have “objected.”\n\nHowever, the inference drawn by Enterprise is false. Magellan had no reason to object because\n\nMagellan had already secured Enterprise’s firm commitment that it would “exclusively utilize the\n\nMagellan Facilities” to deliver its crude oil from any Origin Point to any Destination Point,\n\nregardless. As the non-movant, Magellan is entitled to have all inferences drawn in its favor. All\n\nother statements in paragraph 22 are disputed. In addition, Enterprise asserts facts outside the\n\nfour corners of the COD Agreement that it claims are material to its Motion, yet seeks to prohibit\n\nMagellan from conducting discovery as to those very factual allegations. Without the benefit of\n\nthe discovery to which it is entitled, Magellan cannot adequately assess the truth or otherwise\n\nrespond to Enterprise’s assertions.\n\n             10.   Paragraph 23: Magellan does not dispute that Enterprise acquired Oiltanking\n\nPartners, L.P. in 2014, nor does Magellan claim that it sought to “enjoin” that acquisition.\n\nHowever, the inference drawn by Enterprise is false. Magellan had no reason to seek any such\n\ninjunction because Magellan had already secured Enterprise’s firm commitment that it would\n\n“exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities” to deliver its crude oil from any Origin Point to any\n\nDestination Point, regardless. As the non-movant, Magellan is entitled to have all inferences\n\ndrawn in its favor. All other statements in paragraph 22 are disputed. Again, to support its\n\nMotion, Enterprise relies on its own factual allegations about matters outside the four corners of\n\nthe COD Agreement, but seeks to deny Magellan discovery as to facts Enterprise apparently\n\nbelieves to be essential to a decision on the issues presented in its Motion. Without the benefit of\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 8\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR80\n\fthe discovery to which it is entitled, Magellan cannot adequately assess the truth or otherwise\n\nrespond to Enterprise’s assertions.\n\n             11.    Paragraphs 25–26: Magellan does not dispute the authenticity the document\n\nidentified as Exhibit 2-C to Enterprise’s Motion. Magellan does, however, dispute Enterprise’s\n\nslanted characterization of the email exchange reflected therein. The document speaks for itself.\n\nMoreover, Enterprise’s reliance on the statements contained in Exhibit 2-C contradicts its\n\ncontention that the Court must construe the COD Agreement by examining only the four corners\n\nof the contract and nothing else (which is not the law in any event).\n\nIII.         PLAINTIFF’S STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL FACTS AND SUMMARY JUDGMENT EVIDENCE\n\n             In opposition to the Motion, Magellan submits the following evidence supporting the\n\nfacts set forth below:\n\n             Exhibit 1:    Affidavit of Mark E. Daggett (“Daggett Aff.”)\n\n                    Exhibit 1-A: Jake Everett Email to Mark Daggett, Oct. 18, 2011\n\n                    Exhibit 1-B:   Crude Oil Distribution Agreement, Oct. 31, 2011\n\n                    Exhibit 1-C:   Joint Tariff Agreement, Nov. 1, 2011\n\n                    Exhibit 1-D: Connection Agreement, Dec. 16, 2011\n\n                    Exhibit 1-E:   Crude Oil Purchase Agreement, April 29, 2011 (redacted), and\n                                   First Amended and Restated Crude Oil Purchase and Sale\n                                   Agreement, Jan. 31, 2011 (redacted)\n\n                    Exhibit 1-F:   Enterprise Pipeline Local Tariff, July 1, 2017\n\n             Exhibit 2:    Affidavit of David L.

Magellan owns and operates pipelines and related facilities for the transportation\n\nand distribution of crude oil. Magellan’s facilities in and around the Houston area distribute\n\ncrude oil to refineries and other locations across the Texas Gulf Coast. Those facilities can be\n\naccessed through a point of connection Magellan maintains at a southeast Houston location\n\nknown as Genoa Junction. Daggett Aff. ¶ 2.\n\n             2.   Enterprise is a crude oil marketing company. It purchases crude oil from third\n\nparties and generates revenues by marketing, storing, and transporting the same. In Texas,\n\nEnterprise purchases and markets crude oil produced in, among other regions, a south Texas\n\nproduction area known as the Eagle Ford Shale. Daggett Aff. ¶ 3.\n\n             3.   Enterprise Crude Pipeline LLC (“Enterprise Pipeline”) is an affiliate of\n\nEnterprise. Enterprise Pipeline owns or operates numerous pipeline facilities in Texas. Those\n\nfacilities include a 24-inch diameter crude oil pipeline extending from locations in the Eagle\n\nFord Shale, to Enterprise Pipeline’s facilities in Sealy, Texas, to destinations in the Houston,\n\nTexas area, and the facility known as ECHO Terminal, which is located a few miles southeast of\n\nGenoa Junction. Daggett Aff. ¶¶ 2, 4.\n\n             4.   In 2011, Magellan’s existing facilities in the Houston area included (i) a 26-inch\n\ndiameter pipeline extending from Genoa Junction to BP’s Texas City Refinery in Galveston\n\nCounty and (ii) a 24-inch diameter pipeline extending from Speed Junction to Valero’s Houston\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 10\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR82\n\fRefinery. In the COD Agreement, those were referred to collectively as the “Existing Magellan\n\nFacilities.” Daggett Aff. ¶ 5.\n\n             5.   In the spring of 2011, Magellan was considering whether to construct new\n\npipeline facilities in the Houston area in order to expand and improve its facilities for distribution\n\nof crude oil from the Eagle Ford Shale to refineries and other destinations in the Houston area. In\n\nthe COD Agreement, those were collectively described as the “New Magellan Facilities,” and\n\ntogether with the Existing Magellan Facilities, were described as the “Magellan Facilities.”\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 6.\n\n             6.   The anticipated cost of construction for the New Magellan Facilities was\n\nsignificant. For that reason, Magellan determined that it would not proceed with the project\n\nwithout first obtaining a long-term contract that would provide revenues sufficient to assure the\n\nproject’s commercial and financial viability. Daggett Aff. ¶ 7.\n\n             7.   In mid-2011, Magellan entered into discussions with Enterprise to determine\n\nEnterprise’s interest in utilizing the Magellan Facilities. Specifically, Magellan explored\n\nEnterprise’s willingness to provide, in consideration of incentive tariff rates to be charged by\n\nMagellan, a binding commitment to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities with respect to\n\ntransportation of Eagle Ford crude oil that Enterprise or its affiliates owned or controlled at\n\npoints of origin along Enterprise Pipeline’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system, and for\n\ndistribution and delivery to various Houston-area refineries or other destinations served or to be\n\nserved by the Magellan Facilities. In the parties’ discussions, Enterprise expressed both a need\n\nand a desire to utilize the Magellan Facilities for such purposes. Daggett Aff. ¶ 8.\n\n             8.   Based on Enterprise’s expression of interest, Magellan and Enterprise proceeded\n\nto negotiate—over a period of approximately four months, from July 2011 through October\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 11\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR83\n\f2011—the terms of an agreement providing for Enterprise’s long-term commitment to\n\nexclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities. Through such negotiations, the parties reached an\n\nagreement that for 10 years after the New Magellan Facilities were completed and operational,\n\nand for all crude oil that Enterprise or its affiliates owned or controlled at any of four agreed-\n\nupon Eagle Ford “Origin Points” and transported on Enterprise Pipeline’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston\n\npipeline system, Enterprise would exclusively utilize (and use “best efforts” to cause its affiliates\n\nto exclusively utilize) the Magellan Facilities in order to deliver such crude oil to any of several\n\nagreed-upon “Destination Points.” That is, the parties agreed that such crude oil could not be\n\ndelivered to any such Destination Point without utilizing Magellan’s Houston-area crude oil\n\ndistribution system, accessible at Genoa Junction. Daggett Aff. ¶ 9.\n\n             9.   On October 18, 2011, near the end of the parties’ documentation of their\n\nagreement, Magellan’s principal contract negotiator, Mark Daggett, received an email from one\n\nof the Enterprise negotiators, Jake Everett, proposing to modify the COD Agreement’s definition\n\nof the term “Controlled.” In his message, Mr. Everett explained Enterprise’s understanding of the\n\nparties’ agreement, and its reason for requesting the modification. In relevant part, Mr. Everett’s\n\nemail stated:\n\n                  We would like to revise the definition of “Control” to eliminate the clause\n                  on legal authorization to transport. Our affiliate, Enterprise Crude Oil\n                  Pipeline will be transporting crude for 3rd parties under transportation\n                  agreement rather than a marketing agreement so only the 3rd party will\n                  have authority to determine the ultimate destination.\n\n                  I believe the intent of the agreement was for all of the marketing\n                  volume to move through these [Magellan] connections and that is our\n                  intent, but as soon as a 3rd party requests a delivery outside of this\n                  agreement, we don’t want to be in default. Please let me know if you\n                  disagree with our interpretation.\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 10, Ex. 1-A (emphasis added).\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 12\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR84\n\f             10.   On the same date, October 18, 2011, Mr. Everett and Mr. Daggett discussed\n\nEnterprise’s proposed modification by phone. In that conversation, Mr. Everett reaffirmed\n\nEnterprise’s agreement that all crude oil Enterprise owned or controlled at any time at any\n\nspecified Origin Point (i.e., all Enterprise “marketing volume”) and transported via Enterprise\n\nPipeline’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system would be delivered into Magellan’s Houston-\n\narea distribution system if such crude oil was to be distributed and delivered to any specified\n\nDestination Point. Mr. Everett also reaffirmed that the sole reason for Enterprise’s request to\n\nmodify the definition of “Control” was to distinguish between (i) on the one hand, Enterprise’s\n\n“marketing volumes” of crude oil—i.e., crude oil Enterprise (the marketing company) purchased\n\nfrom third parties and owned or controlled at an Eagle Ford origin point—all of which would be\n\ntransported exclusively to and through the Magellan Facilities if destined for any of the\n\nDestination Points, and (ii) on the other hand, Enterprise Pipeline’s “transportation volumes”—\n\ni.e., crude oil owned by third parties (not by Enterprise) that Enterprise Pipeline would be\n\ntransporting on its Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system in the name and for the account of a\n\nthird party and delivering to a destination point according to the third party’s independent\n\ndirection—which volumes would not be subject to Enterprise’s commitment to exclusively\n\nutilize the Magellan Facilities. Mr. Everett did not state or imply that those “transportation\n\nvolumes” excluded from Enterprise’s commitment to “exclusively utilize” Magellan’s facilities\n\ncould, would, or might also include crude oil that Enterprise had previously owned or controlled.\n\nFurther, he did not state or imply that Enterprise desired or intended to have an agreement which\n\nprovided Enterprise a mere option, as opposed to a binding commitment, to transport its\n\n“marketing volumes” of Eagle Ford crude oil to and through the Magellan Facilities prior to\n\nbeing delivered to a specified Destination Point. Finally, Mr. Everett did not state or imply that\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 13\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     SR85\n\fafter Enterprise entered into the agreement with Magellan, Enterprise or Enterprise Pipeline\n\ncould, would, or might modify the existing Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system in order to\n\nbypass the Genoa Junction connection point into Magellan’s Houston-area distribution system.\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 11.\n\n             11.   The next day, October 19, 2011, Enterprise presented to Magellan a modified\n\ndraft of the parties’ written agreement, in which Enterprise had altered the prior definitions of\n\n“Controlled” and “Owned” by adding the provisos underscored below:\n\n                   1.6 “Controlled” shall mean, when referring to Product, Product that\n                   Shipper or its Affiliates, as the case may be, has the legal right to\n                   transport; provided, however, the custody of Product by an Affiliate of\n                   Shipper that is transporting such Product for the account of a party or\n                   parties other than Shipper or its Affiliates does not constitute Control.\n\n                   1.32 “Owned” shall mean Product to which Shipper or its Affiliate holds\n                   title; provided, however, the custody of Product by an Affiliate of Shipper\n                   that is transporting such Product for the account of a party or parties other\n                   than Shipper or its Affiliates does not constitute being Owned.\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 12.\n\n             12.   Magellan accepted as true, and relied upon, Enterprise’s representations that by\n\nsuggesting such alterations, Enterprise was not attempting to change the substance or effect of\n\nthe parties’ agreement, i.e., that Enterprise was committing to move through the Magellan\n\nFacilities all of the Enterprise “marketing volume” of crude oil, consisting of all crude oil which\n\nEnterprise (the marketing company) owned or controlled at any time. Magellan also accepted as\n\ntrue, and relied upon, Enterprise’s representation that the “transportation volumes” being\n\nexcluded from the scope of the parties’ agreement referred only to third-party-owned crude oil\n\nthat Enterprise Pipeline would be transporting from Eagle Ford origins under bona fide\n\ntransportation agreements which gave such third parties (not Enterprise) the sole legal right to\n\ndetermine where and how their crude oil would be delivered. Unaware of the buy-sell scheme\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 14\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      SR86\n\fEnterprise began to employ soon after it signed the COD Agreement (as discussed below),\n\nMagellan also relied upon the absence of any disclosure by Enterprise that such excluded\n\n“transportation volumes” could, would, or might include crude oil that Enterprise (the marketing\n\ncompany) ever owned or controlled. Accordingly, Magellan accepted and agreed to Enterprise’s\n\nproposed modifications of the contract definitions of “Controlled” and “Owned” as described\n\nabove. Daggett Aff. ¶ 13.\n\n             13.   Enterprise and Magellan executed the COD Agreement, effective October 31,\n\n2011. Daggett Aff. ¶ 14; Ex. 1-B.\n\n             14.   On November 1, 2011, Enterprise Pipeline and Magellan executed a letter\n\nagreement (the “Joint Tariff Agreement”) concerning the joint tariff for transportation of crude\n\noil as contemplated by the COD Agreement. Daggett Aff. ¶ 15, Ex. 1-C. The COD Agreement\n\nspecifically refers to and incorporates the Joint Tariff Agreement. See COD Agreement, Ex. 1-B,\n\nSection 3.1 at 5. The Joint Tariff Agreement expresses Enterprise’s commitment as follows:\n\n                   [T]he shipper agrees to ship under the Joint Tariff all crude owned or\n                   controlled by it from an Origin Point through the Connection Point to a\n                   Destination Point.\n\nEx. 1-C (emphasis added).\n\n             15.   To facilitate and implement the delivery of crude oil to and through the Magellan\n\nFacilities, in accordance with the commitment Enterprise made under the COD Agreement,\n\nMagellan and Enterprise Pipeline also negotiated and entered into a new pipeline connection\n\nagreement effective December 16, 2011 (the “Connection Agreement”). Daggett Aff. ¶ 16.\n\n             16.   In reliance upon the representations and commitments Enterprise made to\n\nMagellan, and the parties’ resulting agreements, as described above, Magellan proceeded to\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 15\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR87\n\fconstruct the New Magellan Facilities. Construction of the New Magellan Facilities took\n\napproximately 18 months, at a cost of $20 million or more. Daggett Aff. ¶ 17.\n\n             17.   At no time during this construction did Enterprise inform Magellan that\n\nEnterprise desired to amend its contractual commitment to exclusively utilize the Magellan\n\nFacilities, or that Enterprise viewed the COD Agreement as giving Enterprise an option, but no\n\nobligation, to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities. Daggett Aff. ¶ 18.\n\n             18.   On June 3, 2013, Magellan provided written notice to Enterprise that the New\n\nMagellan Facilities would be operational and ready for service on July 1, 2013. Pursuant to\n\nSection 2.1 of the COD Agreement, the “In-Service Date” occurred on July 1, 2013. Pursuant to\n\nSection 2.1 of the COD Agreement, Enterprise’s 10-year commitment to exclusively utilize the\n\nMagellan Facilities began on July 1, 2013 and extends to July 1, 2023. Daggett Aff. ¶ 19.\n\n             19.   Following the In-Service Date, Enterprise failed and refused to make crude oil\n\nshipments to or through the Magellan Facilities, pursuant to the terms of the COD Agreement.\n\nThe limited data Enterprise has provided to date in response to Magellan’s audit requests\n\nindicates that since September 2013, Enterprise has purchased and marketed over 175,000,000\n\nbarrels of Eagle Ford crude oil that did not move through the Magellan Facilities. Daggett Aff. ¶\n\n20.\n\n             20.   When the parties entered into the COD Agreement in 2011, and when the In-\n\nService Date occurred in 2013, Enterprise Pipeline’s Eagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline system\n\nextended, via Enterprise Pipeline’s Rancho pipeline, directly to the Genoa Junction connection\n\npoint with Magellan’s Houston-area distribution system. After signing the COD Agreement,\n\nhowever, Enterprise Pipeline constructed a new crude oil pipeline dubbed the “Rancho II,”\n\nconsisting of approximately 88 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline extending from Sealy directly\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 16\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    SR88\n\fto ECHO Terminal. Unlike the preexisting Rancho pipeline from Sealy to Houston, which\n\nEnterprise Pipeline renamed as “Rancho I,” the Rancho II pipeline completely bypasses the\n\nGenoa Junction connection point with Magellan’s Houston-area crude oil distribution system.\n\nDaggett Aff. ¶ 21.\n\n             21.   In April 2015, Magellan invoked it rights, pursuant to Section 4.4 of the COD\n\nAgreement, to conduct an audit of Enterprise’s compliance with the COD Agreement. During the\n\ncourse of that audit, Magellan uncovered evidence that, shortly after signing the COD\n\nAgreement, Enterprise began using third-party buy-sell contracts to circumvent its obligations\n\nunder the COD Agreement. Specifically, Magellan discovered that Enterprise had, for at least\n\nthree different third-party producers, replaced its preexisting third-party marketing contract,\n\nwhich provided only for Enterprise’s purchase of the third-party’s Eagle Ford crude oil\n\nproduction, with new buy-sell contracts which allowed Enterprise to buy the third-party’s Eagle\n\nFord crude oil production and then resell the same volume of crude oil back to the third-party\n\nproducer downstream of the Eagle Ford Origin Point but before the crude oil reached the\n\nMagellan Connection Point at Genoa Junction. Daggett Aff. ¶ 22; Ex. 1-E.\n\n             22.   Enterprise began utilizing that buy-sell scheme no later than January 2012. During\n\nthis time, Enterprise never told Magellan that it was replacing its Eagle Ford crude oil purchase\n\nagreements with buy-sell agreements. Daggett Aff. ¶ 23.\n\n             23.   In December 2015, while Magellan’s audit was pending, Enterprise Pipeline\n\nphysically disconnected its facilities at Anahuac Junction from Magellan’s Genoa Junction-to-\n\nTexas City pipeline. Daggett Aff. ¶ 24. The severance of the connection at Anahuac Junction\n\nbetween Magellan’s facilities and Enterprise Pipeline’s facilities occurred over Magellan’s\n\nobjection and made it impossible for Magellan to deliver crude oil into Enterprise Pipeline’s\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 17\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR89\n\fpipeline at Anahuac Junction, which is one of the four initial Destination Points specified in the\n\nCOD Agreement. Id. The severance of that connection was in breach of Enterprise Pipeline’s\n\nobligations under the Connection Agreement.\n\n             24.   In or about May 2017, Enterprise Pipeline posted a new tariff for transportation of\n\ncrude oil moving from ECHO Terminal to Magellan’s facilities at Genoa Junction. Under the\n\nnew tariff, effective as of July 1, 2017, Enterprise Pipeline has essentially doubled the local tariff\n\nan Enterprise customer must pay in order to transport crude oil (including crude oil the customer\n\nsold to Enterprise at an Eagle Ford Origin Point and bought back from Enterprise at ECHO\n\nTerminal) from ECHO Terminal to Magellan’s facilities at Genoa Junction, on Enterprise\n\nPipeline’s ECHO-to-Genoa Junction pipeline. By that means, Enterprise or its affiliates have\n\ndramatically increased the cost, and correspondingly decreased the economic incentive, for\n\nshippers to transport crude oil via Magellan’s Houston-area distribution system (instead of the\n\nEnterprise system) to any of the Destination Points specified in the COD Agreement. Daggett\n\nAff. ¶ 25.\n\n             25.   Magellan has served discovery requests to Enterprise and subpoenas duces tecum\n\nto three non-parties. Bryant Aff. ¶¶ 3, 5-6. The evidence Magellan has sought to discover\n\nthrough the above-described discovery requests is relevant to the claims Magellan asserts in this\n\naction, material to the resolution of the Motion, and potentially essential to the resolution of\n\nissues presented by the Motion. Id., ¶¶ 10-13. However, as a result of the Enterprise Motion for\n\nProtection and to Stay Discovery Pending Resolution of Defendant’s Dispositive Motion, and the\n\nparties’ subsequent Rule 11 agreement, Magellan has not had any discovery in this action and\n\nhas not had adequate time or opportunity to obtain any discovery.

For\n\nanyone less familiar with the territory, understanding what the transportation commitment set\n\nforth in Section 4.1 really means requires examination of the whole agreement (the full four\n\ncorners), and interpretation of the contract language “in light of the circumstances present when\n\nthe contract was entered,”3 viewed from a “utilitarian” (practical, common sense) standpoint\n\n“bearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be served, and avoiding unreasonable\n\nconstructions.”4\n\n                                       — The Context of the Contract —\n\n             As shown by the parties’ respective fact statements, at least some of the material\n\ncircumstances surrounding the COD Agreement are not in dispute. For example, Enterprise is a\n\ncrude oil marketing company which purchases its customers’ crude oil on location in a producing\n\nregion (e.g., Eagle Ford Shale) and then transports or “markets” it, via pipelines and distribution\n\n\n\n3\n    Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc., 352 S.W.3d at 449–50.\n4\n    Plains, 473 S.W.3d at 305.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 23\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR95\n\fsystems owned by Enterprise Pipeline, to refineries or other final destinations (e.g., Houston-area\n\nrefineries).\n\n             There is no dispute that when the parties entered into the COD Agreement, crude oil\n\nproduction in the Eagle Ford Shale was growing rapidly, creating a need for expanded\n\ntransportation and distribution facilities to move Eagle Ford crude oil to Houston-area\n\ndestinations. Magellan already had a substantial crude oil transportation and distribution system\n\nthat was directly connected and capable of delivering crude oil to multiple refineries in or near\n\nHouston, but was considering expansion of its Houston-area transportation and distribution\n\nfacilities. Enterprise Pipeline was also in the process of developing its Houston-area crude oil\n\nterminal facility known as ECHO Terminal, that could eventually compete with Magellan’s\n\nHouston-area crude oil distribution system. However, at the time, Enterprise Pipeline had a\n\npipeline system that originated in the Eagle Ford Shale and extended (via Rancho I pipeline) to a\n\npoint of connection into Magellan’s Houston-area distribution system at Genoa Junction.\n\n             Thus, Enterprise expressed to Magellan an immediate need and desire to utilize\n\nMagellan’s Houston-area systems, if and when Magellan completed an expansion that would\n\naccommodate the volume of Eagle Ford crude oil Enterprise anticipated marketing and\n\ndelivering to the Houston area. Enterprise and Magellan proceeded to negotiate the terms of the\n\nCOD Agreement over a period of about four months.\n\n             In the final stages of the parties’ documentation of their agreement, one of the Enterprise\n\nnegotiators represented to Magellan’s representative, in writing, that “I believe the intent of the\n\nagreement was for all of the marketing volume to move through these [Magellan]\n\nconnections and that is our [Enterprise’s] intent. . . .”5 And as reflected in COD Agreement,\n\n\n5\n    Ex. 1-A (emphasis added).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 24\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           SR96\n\fthe parties contemplated that Enterprise would deliver all such crude oil into the Magellan\n\ndistribution system at Genoa Junction, by one of two possible routes between an Origin Point\n\nand the Magellan connection point at Genoa Junction, i.e., either (i) directly from the existing\n\nEagle Ford-to-Houston pipeline (via Rancho I), or (ii) if Enterprise first moved the crude oil past\n\nMagellan’s Genoa Junction connection point to Enterprise’s nearby ECHO Terminal, then back\n\nto the Magellan connection point on an ECHO-to-Genoa Junction pipeline being constructed by\n\nEnterprise Pipeline.\n\n                                 — The Four Corners of the Contract —\n\n             The COD Agreement begins with a series of recitals. Regarding the existing Enterprise\n\nfacilities, one of the recitals states:\n\n                    Enterprise Pipeline owns the 24-inch diameter crude oil pipeline facility\n                    (“Eagle Ford Pipeline System”) that extends from the Origin Points (as\n                    hereafter defined) in south Texas to the Connection Point (as hereafter\n                    defined) with Magellan’s Genoa Junction and owns the Webster-area\n                    terminal located south of Genoa Junction (the “Echo Terminal”);6\n\n             The final recital in the COD Agreement states the essential purpose of the contract, as\n\nfollows:\n\n                    WHEREAS, Shipper, to facilitate Magellan’s construction of the New\n                    Magellan Facilities, is willing to provide the commitment described in this\n                    Agreement.7\n\nThat is, Enterprise made its long-term exclusive-use commitment for the express purpose of\n\ninducing Magellan’s costly construction of the New Magellan Facilities.\n\n             Then, the preamble states the parties’ mutual intention to be legally bound to perform\n\ntheir respective promises:\n\n\n\n6\n    Ex. 1-B at 1(bold original, underscore added).\n7\n    Ex. 1-B at 1(underscore added).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 25\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR97\n\f                    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual\n                    covenants and agreements contained herein, and of other good and\n                    valuable consideration the receipt, adequacy and sufficiency of which are\n                    acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Magellan and\n                    Shipper agree as follows:8\n\n             The 10-year term of contract is set forth in Section 2.1, which states in relevant part:\n\n                    2.1 Term.

However, Enterprise is flatly wrong when it says that under the “plain\n\nlanguage” of the contract, Enterprise can wash its hands of the commitment simply by (i)\n\nchoosing to bypass the Magellan Connection Point instead of delivering Product to that\n\nConnection Point, or (ii) taking Product Enterprise purchases from a marketing customer and\n\nowns at an Origin Point, transporting the Product (in Enterprise’s own name and for its own\n\naccount) directly to Enterprise’s ECHO Terminal, and then choosing to sell the crude back to the\n\nsame customer at ECHO Terminal.\n\n             Indeed, the Enterprise interpretation of its “commitment” to “exclusively utilize”\n\nMagellan’s facilities could be restated as follows:\n\n                    “Shipper has the option, but not the obligation, to utilize the Magellan\n                    Facilities for transportation and delivery, to a Destination Point, of any\n\n11\n     Motion at 17 (all emphasis in original).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 27\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                              SR99\n\f                   Product that Shipper owns or controls at an Origin Point; provided, that\n                   Shipper reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to exclusively utilize its\n                   own facilities for all such deliveries.”\n\n             What Enterprise actually gave in Section 4.1, however, was a “commitment,” which\n\nmeans a “promise or pledge to do something,” not an option.12 To “exclusively utilize” also has\n\nspecific meaning, and does not suggest “optional” use of the Magellan Facilities. Had Enterprise\n\nso intended, it could have negotiated for an option to utilize Magellan’s facilities or not, at its\n\nwhim. However, the COD Agreement contains no such “option” language. The Joint Tariff also\n\nconfirms Enterprise’s commitment “to ship under the Joint Tariff all crude owned or controlled\n\nby it from an Origin Point through the Connection Point to a Destination Point.”13 And not\n\nsurprisingly, Enterprise offers no explanation or logical reason why Magellan or any other\n\nrational business in its position would have invested tens of millions of dollars based on they\n\ntype of hollow and worthless “commitment” Enterprise claims it made. In any case, the Motion\n\nmust fail because Enterprise’s currently professed view of Section 4.1’s “plain language” is not a\n\nreasonable interpretation, let alone the only reasonable interpretation.\n\n                3) Section 4.1 Cannot be Construed, As a Matter of Law, to Either:\n\n                   (i) “Condition” the Enterprise Commitment on delivery of crude to a\n                       Designated Magellan Connection Point, or\n\n                   (ii) Permit Enterprise to Avoid Its Commitment By Causing Product Not to\n                        Be Delivered to the Magellan Connection Point\n\n             Enterprise argues that, as a matter of law, it has not breached the COD Agreement\n\nbecause the Section 4.1 language—“provided, that such deliveries … are … transported to the\n\nConnection Point” with the Magellan Facilities—creates a “condition” precedent to Enterprise’s\n\n\n\n12\n     Webster’s New International Dictionary 539 (2d ed. 1945).\n13\n     Ex. 1-C (emphasis added).\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 28\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      SR100\n\fobligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities, and that “condition” has never\n\noccurred.14 Properly construed, however, the language introduced by the words “provided, that”\n\ndoes not make Enterprise’s delivery of Product to the designated Magellan Connection Point a\n\n“condition” of the Enterprise commitment to use the Magellan Facilities originating there.\n\nFurther, if Enterprise’s commitment was truly conditioned on its delivery of Product to the\n\ndesignated Magellan Connection Point, by law Enterprise could not avoid the commitment to use\n\nthe Magellan Facilities by causing the delivery condition not to occur, such as by choosing to\n\ndeliver Product to its own facilities instead.\n\n                    a) The language Enterprise relies on does not create a condition precedent to\n                       Enterprise’s obligation to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities\n\n             “A condition precedent is an act or event that must take place before performance of a\n\ncontractual obligation is due.” Cedyco Corp. v.

Indeed, Texas\n\nSupreme Court authority teaches that:\n\n                    In construing a contract, forfeiture by finding a condition precedent is to\n                    be avoided when another reasonable reading of the contract is possible.\n                    When the intent of the parties is doubtful or when a condition would\n                    impose an absurd or impossible result, the agreement will be interpreted as\n                    creating a covenant rather than a condition. Because of their harshness in\n                    operation, conditions are not favorites of the law.\n\nCriswell v.

The answer is simple.\n\n             First, the words following “provided, that” define and clarify the scope of the Eagle Ford\n\ntransportation business both parties intended to be included in the Enterprise transportation\n\ncommitment, which subparts A and B of Section 4.1 very broadly state but do not specifically\n\ndefine. The Court will note that neither subparts A and B, nor the defined terms embedded\n\ntherein, specifically tie the exclusive-use commitment to Eagle Ford crude, or to the specified\n\nOrigin Points, or to the Destination Points. Those gaps are filled—the intended scope of the\n\ncommitment is defined and clarified—by the words following “provided, that.”\n\n             Second, the words “transported … to the Connection Point” simply identify the specific\n\nlocation where Enterprise must deliver crude into Magellan’s distribution system in order to\n\nfulfill its commitment as defined. As the contract’s definition of “Connection Point” makes\n\nclear,18 delivery into Magellan’s system must occur at one of two points of connection with the\n\nMagellan valve located at Genoa Junction, as distinguished from any other location within the\n\nvast complex of the “Magellan Facilities” as defined in the agreement. Thus, the words\n\n“transported … to the Connection Point” constitute a covenant that in fulfilling its commitment\n\nEnterprise will deliver crude to the specified location (not somewhere else), not a “condition” on\n\nthe Enterprise commitment to make exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities. That is why\n\n“transported ... to the Connection Point” is included, and that is all it means.\n\n             In other words, the phrase “transported … to the Connection Point” is not surplus and\n\ndoes have meaning, but not the meaning Enterprise puts on it. In fact, Enterprise’s spin on that\n\nlanguage makes circular nonsense out of Section 4.1, as though it meant: “Shipper agrees to\n\n\n18\n     See Ex. 1-B at 2, Section 1.5.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 31\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          SR103\n\fexclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities only IF Shipper delivers Product to the Magellan\n\nFacilities,” as it must (at some location) in order to utilize the Magellan Facilities at all.\n\n             Enterprise’s take on Section 4.1’s “transported … to the Connection Point” language also\n\nviolates another canon of construction, to harmonize and give effect to all provisions of the\n\ncontract so that none will be rendered meaningless or superfluous.19 The first “Commitment\n\nException” set forth in Section 4.2 of the COD Agreement states that if Enterprise “requires\n\nmore capacity than Magellan has available,” then Enterprise “may utilize third party facilities to\n\ntransport such excess Product until such time that Magellan has capacity available.”20 If, as\n\nEnterprise claims, it had no binding obligation to deliver any crude to the Magellan Connection\n\nPoint, what would be the point of including such an exception? None.\n\n             Additionally, Magellan’s interpretation of the “to the Connection Point” language\n\npreserves the reality of Enterprise’s exclusive use commitment, whereas Enterprise’s\n\ninterpretation makes the commitment illusory, in violation of another time-honored rule of\n\nconstruction. See El Paso Field Servs. L.P., 389 S.W.3d at 805; Texas Gas Utilities Co. v.\n\nBarrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1687528\"><a href=\"/opinion/1687528/texas-gas-utilities-company-v-barrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412 (Tex. 1970) (“A contract will be construed in favor of\n\nmutuality.”). Enterprise tries to paper over that problem, arguing that its interpretation of Section\n\n4.1 does not make its commitment illusory because Enterprise gave consideration by forfeiting a\n\nright to use third party facilities which, like Magellan’s, have connection points at or near Genoa\n\nJunction. That is hogwash.\n\n             While it is true that Enterprise committed not to use such third parties’ facilities unless\n\nthe volume of Product in transport exceeded Magellan’s capacity to handle, that was not the\n\n\n\n19\n     El Paso Field Servs., L.P., 389 S.W.3d at 805.\n20\n     Ex. 1-B at 6, Section 4.2.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 32\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           SR104\n\fmaterial consideration for the deal. The material consideration Magellan bargained for (and got)\n\nwas Enterprise’s promise to exclusively use facilities owned by Magellan, instead of\n\nEnterprise’s own competing facilities at ECHO Terminal or elsewhere. That fundamental aspect\n\nof the bargain is plainly reflected in Section 4.2, which (in the exceptional circumstances\n\ndescribed) expressly allows Enterprise to use “third party” facilities but not its own. Enterprise\n\ncommitted Eagle Ford crude transportation business to Magellan, free from any interference by\n\nEnterprise or its affiliates, including any interference that might come from the ongoing\n\nexpansion of their facilities at the nearby ECHO Terminal.\n\n             In sum, Enterprise’s contention that Section 4.1 must be construed to “condition” its\n\ncommitment upon delivery of Product to the Magellan Connection Point—to mean, in effect,\n\nthat Enterprise will make exclusive use of Magellan’s distribution facilities only IF Enterprise\n\ndecides to deliver Product to the Connection Point with Magellan’s system—is clearly wrong\n\nand should be rejected.\n\n                    b) In any event, Enterprise cannot escape its transportation “commitment” by\n                       choosing not to transport Product “to the Connection Point”\n\n             It is hornbook contract law that a party whose obligation is conditioned upon the\n\noccurrence of an event within that party’s control cannot escape its obligation by purposely\n\ncausing the event not to occur.

Requirements contract are merely one type of agreement in which a party’s\nperformance obligation is subject to a condition within that party’s exclusive control. See Restatement\n(Second) of Contracts § 77 cmt d. The law discussed above equally applies to output/requirements\ncontracts. Indeed, the very case Enterprise relies on stands for the proposition that the law imposes on\nrequirements buyers an implied duty that prevents them from evading their contractual obligations by\nreducing their requirements.

In fact, nothing in the contract expressly\n\nanswers the question: when or where must the Eagle Ford crude be owned or controlled by\n\nEnterprise in order for its Magellan transportation commitment to apply?\n\n             Subparts A and B of Section 4.1 state that the Enterprise commitment applies to “all\n\ndeliveries of Product that are Owned or Controlled by Shipper [or any Affiliate],” but they do not\n\ndirectly identify any particular time or place where Enterprise’s ownership or control must exist\n\nin order for its exclusive use commitment to apply. Nor is that matter specifically addressed in\n\nthe contract’s definitions of the terms “Owned” or “Controlled.” The term “Owned” is defined:\n\n                1.32 “Owned” shall mean Product to which Shipper or its Affiliate holds title;\n                provided, however, the custody of Product by an Affiliate of Shipper that is\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 37\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             SR109\n\f                transporting such Product for the account of a party or parties other than\n                Shipper or its Affiliates does not constitute being Owned.24\n\nThe definition of “Controlled” is substantially the same.25\n\n             However, when the language of the COD Agreement is examined in full and in context,\n\nall signs point to the Origin Point, strongly indicating that Enterprise’s ownership or control of\n\ncrude at any Eagle Ford Origin Point is sufficient to satisfy Section 4.1’s owned/controlled\n\nrequirement. Eagle Ford Origin Points are the central focus of the whole COD Agreement.\n\nFurther, the COD Agreement owes its very existence to crude oil transportation business\n\ncoming from Eagle Ford origins, and the contract revolves around crude Enterprise owns and\n\nmarkets from certain Eagle Ford Origin Points. What is more, subparts A and B of Section 4.1\n\ntie Enterprise’s commitment to “all deliveries of Product that are Owned or Controlled by\n\nShipper [or any Affiliate].” This clear and plain reference to “all” deliveries indicates that\n\nEnterprise’s ownership of Product at the Origin Point or at any time or place along the route\n\nbetween Origin Point and Destination Point is sufficient. Unlike the Enterprise interpretation,\n\nthis view harmonizes all provisions of the COD Agreement and is consistent with the mutual\n\nintent and purpose of the agreement— as Enterprise put it, “the intent of the agreement was for\n\nall of the marketing volume to move through these [Magellan] connections, and that is our\n\nintent….”26\n\n             Magellan submits that its interpretation of the ownership/control requirement is the only\n\nreasonable interpretation of Section 4.1 when construed in the manner required by well-\n\nestablished principles discussed above. Enterprise’s interpretation, on the other hand, is wholly\n\n\n24\n     Ex. 1-B at 2, Section 1.32.\n25\n     Ex. 1-B at 2, Section 1.6.\n26\n     Ex. 1-A.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 38\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         SR110\n\funreasonable because it would allow Enterprise to switch its commitment off or on at will. A\n\ncardinal rule of contract interpretation is to avoid, if possible, any such unreasonable\n\nconstruction of the language used. See Plains, 473 S.W.3d at 305.\n\n             At a minimum, Magellan’s interpretation is a reasonable construction consistent with the\n\ncircumstances under which the COD Agreement was made, the purpose for which it was made,\n\nthe contract as a whole, and the express language used in Section 4.1. This precludes summary\n\njudgment based on Enterprise’s argument that the COD Agreement unambiguously requires\n\nEnterprise to own or control its Eagle Ford crude continuously from end-to-end of the transport\n\nfrom an Origin Point to a Destination Point.\n\n                    b) Regardless, Enterprise cannot avoid its commitment by manipulating Product\n                       ownership/control downstream from an Origin Point\n\n             Just as delivery of Product to Magellan’s Connection Point is within the sole control of\n\nEnterprise, so is ownership or control of Product at all times and locations between an Origin\n\nPoint and a Connection Point into Magellan’s distribution system. Enterprise is not compelled by\n\nany law or regulation to sell its Eagle Ford crude after it leaves an Origin Point but before it\n\nreaches the Magellan Facilities. Instead, and as far as is currently known, pursuant to buy-sell\n\nagreements it made after executing the COD Agreement Enterprise is voluntarily reselling to a\n\ncustomer, at ECHO Terminal, the same volume of crude Enterprise purchases from the customer\n\nand thus owns at an Origin Point.\n\n             As discussed above, when a contracting party’s obligation is actually conditioned upon\n\nthe occurrence of an event or subject to a requirement within that party’s own control, the law\n\nprevents the party from avoiding its obligation by causing the condition or requirement not to be\n\nfulfilled. That principle applies to the contract requirement of Product ownership or control by\n\nEnterprise. The contract requirement is satisfied if Enterprise purchases and owns crude at an\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 39\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR111\n\fOrigin Point, and no subsequent transfer of ownership can defeat Enterprise’s transportation\n\ncommitment to Magellan.27\n\n             For all of these reasons, the no-evidence Motion for summary judgment on Magellan’s\n\nbreach of contract claim should be denied.\n\n     B.      ENTERPRISE IS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON MAGELLAN’S CONTRACT\n             REFORMATION CLAIM (SECOND CLAIM, IN THE ALTERNATIVE)\n\n             Enterprise next contends that Magellan’s reformation claim fails because Magellan\n\ncannot demonstrate the existence of a mutual mistake. In particular, Enterprise argues that\n\n“[e]vidence of mistake must be clear, exact and satisfactory” and that “Magellan cannot make\n\nthis showing.”\n\n             For Enterprise to make this argument, at this stage, is ironic. Enterprise filed the Motion\n\nless than two months into the case, and then moved to block all the discovery Magellan had\n\ncommenced. To then argue that Magellan has no evidence sufficient to prove its reformation\n\nclaim, as will be required at trial, takes “gumption” to say the least.\n\n             “A party should not be able to abuse the discovery process by withholding key evidence\n\nfrom a party opponent and then use that lack of evidence to win a judgment.” McInnis v.

It is a clear abuse of discretion to terminate a party’s claim on\n\n27\n   Because it cannot point this Court to any contract provision which states that for crude to be subject to\nEnterprise’s transportation commitment it must be owned/controlled by Enterprise not only at an Origin\nPoint but all at all times and points along the transportation route to a Destination Point, Enterprise resorts\nto arguing that nothing in the contract expressly obligates Enterprise to “ensure that the crude oil remains\nowned by Enterprise or its affiliates at all stages of the transport.” Motion at 20 (emphasis added). That\nargument misses the point. Regardless of whether the COD Agreement requires Enterprise to maintain\nownership of Product all the way from Origin Point to a Connection Point with the Magellan Facilities, it\ndoes require Enterprise to ensure that the commitment to exclusively utilize Magellan’s facilities is\nhonored and fulfilled even if ownership of Product is transferred to another at some stage of the Product’s\ntransport from an Origin Point.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 40\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                  SR112\n\fthe merits, for lacking sufficient evidence, before any discovery has taken place. See id. That is\n\nprecisely what Enterprise is asking the Court to do here. The request should be denied.\n\n             But regardless of its obvious prematurity, Enterprise’s argument is meritless. Even\n\nwithout the benefit of any discovery, Magellan has presented sufficient evidence to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of fact regarding its reformation claim. “[R]eformation requires two elements: (1)\n\nan original agreement and (2) a mutual mistake, made after the original agreement, in reducing\n\nthe original agreement to writing.” Cherokee Water Co. v.

Magellan has offered ample evidence of both. Mark Daggett negotiated the COD\n\nAgreement on Magellan’s behalf. As Mr. Daggett explains in his affidavit, both parties\n\nexpressed, in writing, their understanding that Enterprise was agreeing to exclusively utilize the\n\nMagellan Facilities for all deliveries of Enterprise “marketing” volume of crude oil moving from\n\nthe Origin Points to the Destination Points. Thus, assuming the parties’ true agreement is not\n\nfaithfully embodied in Section 4.1 of the COD Agreement (and, again, it is), then Magellan has,\n\nat the very least, presented sufficient evidence that the COD Agreement, as written, is the result\n\nof a mutual mistake in reducing the parties’ actual agreement to writing. Summary judgment at\n\nthis stage is, therefore, both premature and entirely improper.\n\n   C.        ENTERPRISE IS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT                    ON   MAGELLAN’S\n             DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CLAIM (THIRD CLAIM)\n\n             Enterprise argues that Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim duplicates Magellan’s\n\nbreach of contract claim and, therefore, is not justiciable. That is incorrect. The declaratory\n\njudgment claim concerns more than Enterprise’s past breach of the COD Agreement; it also\n\nconcerns Enterprise’s legal obligation for future performance of the transportation commitment\n\nover the remaining four years of the COD Agreement’s term. Accordingly, the declaratory\n\njudgment claim is justiciable.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 41\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     SR113\n\f             Although declaratory relief “is not available to settle disputes already pending before\n\n[the] court,” this rule does not apply where the declaratory relief sought “has greater\n\nramifications than the original suit.” BHP Petroleum Co.

Thus, in a breach of\n\ncontract case, if the requested declaratory relief seeks “an interpretation of the … contract, which\n\nwould have the effect of defining the obligations of the parties under that contract for the\n\nforeseeable future,” then that relief is not barred or non-justiciable merely because of a pending\n\nbreach of contract claim seeking past damages.28 BHP Petroleum Co.

For these reasons, promissory estoppel is often described as “a viable alternative\n\nto breach of contract.” Trevino, 400 S.W.3d at 146.\n\n             Here, Magellan has pled a promissory estoppel claim, in the alternative to its breach of\n\ncontract claim. Magellan’s promissory estoppel claim seeks to recover on the promise Enterprise\n\nmade to Magellan on October 18, 2011,29 that Enterprise would exclusively use the Magellan\n\nFacilities for all Origin Point-to-Destination Point deliveries of Enterprise’s “marketing”\n\nvolumes of crude oil—that is, crude Enterprise owns and markets from an Origin Point, as\n\n29\n     Ex. 1-A.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 43\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR115\n\fdistinguished from crude others own and merely transport in their own names and for their own\n\naccounts, on an Enterprise pipeline. Magellan believes that Enterprise’s promise is synonymous\n\nwith the Enterprise transportation commitment as expressed in Section 4.1 of the parties’ written\n\nagreement. However, if the Court should determine that Enterprise’s interpretation of Section 4.1\n\nof the COD Agreement is the only reasonable interpretation of its transportation “commitment”\n\nas expressed in the written contract (which it should not), then Magellan would have an\n\nactionable promissory estoppel claim based on Enterprise’s promise. This is so for at least two\n\nreasons.\n\n             First, under Enterprise’s construction of the Section 4.1, its promise would fall outside of\n\nthe parties’ written contract and thus provide a basis for an independent promissory estoppel\n\nclaim. See Harris Const. Co., LTD., 698 F. Supp. 2d at 730. Second, if Section 4.1 of the COD\n\nAgreement means what Enterprise says, then its exclusive-use commitment is illusory and\n\nunenforceable. Without a valid agreement, promissory estoppel provides an available remedy.\n\nSee Transcon. Realty Inv’rs, Inc., 286 S.W.3d at 648.\n\n             In other words, Enterprise cannot have it both ways. If the promise at issue is embodied\n\nin Section 4.1 of the COD Agreement (which it is), then Magellan is entitled to pursue and\n\nrecover damages under its breach of contract claim. If, on the other hand, the Court endorses the\n\nEnterprise interpretation of Section 4.1 as a matter of law, then Magellan has a viable claim for\n\npromissory estoppel.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 44\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            SR116\n\f     E.      ENTERPRISE IS NOT ENTITLED        TO   SUMMARY JUDGMENT        ON   MAGELLAN’S FRAUD\n             CLAIM (FIFTH CLAIM)\n\n             As Magellan alleged in its Original Petition,30 when it approved and signed the COD\n\nAgreement as written, Magellan accepted as true and relied upon various Enterprise\n\nmisrepresentations or material omissions including the following:\n\n                Enterprise’s representation that for all of its “marketing volume” of Eagle Ford crude\n                 oil—which Magellan understood to mean crude oil Enterprise would purchase from\n                 Eagle Ford customers and would have the legal right to transport from the Eagle Ford\n                 Shale to Houston-area destination points—Enterprise intended to use the Magellan\n                 Facilities and was legally binding itself to transport the crude through the Magellan\n                 Facilities.\n\n                Enterprise’s representation that by suggesting certain changes in the contract\n                 definitions of “Owned” and “Controlled,” Enterprise was not attempting to change\n                 the substance or effect of the parties’ actual agreement regarding Enterprise’s\n                 exclusive use of the Magellan Facilities.\n\n                Enterprise’s representation that the “transportation volumes”—the Eagle Ford crude\n                 being excluded from the scope of Enterprise’s transportation commitment to\n                 Magellan—were limited to customer-owned (not Enterprise-owned) crude that\n                 Enterprise Pipeline would be transporting from an Eagle Ford location to a final\n                 destination as directed by those customers pursuant to bona fide transportation\n                 agreements between the pipeline company and its customers.\n\n                The lack of any disclosure that, in fact, Enterprise was planning to replace existing\n                 marketing agreements with buy/sell agreements and claim that once the crude was\n                 resold to the marketing customer Enterprise’s commitment to make exclusive use of\n                 the Magellan Facilities no longer applied.\n\n             Magellan’s Original Petition also alleges that Enterprise’s misrepresentations or\n\nconcealments of material information continued after the parties signed the COD Agreement -\n\nmisleading Magellan to believe that Enterprise really intended to make exclusive use of the\n\nMagellan Facilities being developed at great cost, not that Enterprise viewed its “commitment”\n\n\n\n\n30\n     See Original Petition ¶¶ 30-35.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 45\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          SR117\n\fas nothing more than an option to use Magellan’s facilities if/when Enterprise chose not to use its\n\nown.31 Such conduct by Enterprise clearly supports Magellan’s claim of fraud.32\n\n             The no-evidence Motion does not challenge the admissibility or sufficiency of\n\nMagellan’s evidence in support of its fraud claim, and for good reason. The no-evidence Motion\n\nis premature, as Magellan has not had any discovery. The currently available evidence presented\n\nby Magellan is clearly admissible; the parol evidence rule does not apply to a fraud claim.33\n\nFinally, even if the Motion were not premature, Magellan’s burden would only be to present a\n\nscintilla of evidence which could support its fraud claim, giving Magellan the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences. Lightning Oil Co., 520 S.W.3d at 45.\n\n             Enterprise’s summary judgment argument rests on (i) an assumption that Enterprise’s\n\ninterpretation of the COD Agreement is correct as a matter of law, and (ii) an assertion that if the\n\nCourt agrees with Enterprise’s interpretation of the contract as written, Magellan’s reliance on\n\nEnterprise’s misrepresentations was unjustifiable as a matter of law, because Magellan must\n\nhave known it was being lied to. Neither of those is correct.\n\n\n\n\n31\n     See Original Petition ¶¶ 45-49.\n32\n    A claim for fraudulent inducement arises when a party is induced to enter into an agreement through\nfraud or misrepresentation.

To prevail on a\nfraudulent inducement claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant knowingly made a false\nrepresentation, (2) intending to induce the plaintiff to enter into an agreement, and (3) that the plaintiff\nrelied on the misrepresentation to its detriment.

In this regard, Enterprise cites various\n\ncases for the proposition that reliance on a misrepresentation is unjustified and unjustifiable if the\n\nmatter misrepresented “is directly contradicted by the express, unambiguous terms of a written\n\nagreement.” See, e.g., H2O Sols., Ltd. v.

Id. at\n\n624–25.34 As the cases cited by Enterprise make clear, the mere fact that a court, upon applying\n\napplicable rules of contract interpretation, may determine a contract to be unambiguous, does not\n\nnecessarily mean that a party who relied on misrepresentations about the agreement must have\n\nknown they were misrepresentations. An agreement that lacks clarity may nonetheless be found\n\nto be technically “unambiguous.” See Universal Health Servs., Inc. v.

For this reason, to defeat a claim\n\nof reliance on a fraudulent misrepresentation, Texas law requires proof that the written contract\n\n“directly contradict[s]” the defendant’s oral misrepresentation in “express … terms.” H2O Sols.,\n\nLtd., 438 S.W.3d at 624 (emphasis added).\n\n             Here, whatever may be said for Enterprise’s interpretive arguments, the COD Agreement\n\ndoes not directly contradict Enterprise’s misrepresentations, in express terms. The contract does\n\ndirect or expressly state that Enterprise can defeat its exclusive-use obligation by transferring\n\ntitle to crude downstream from an Origin Point or by refusing to deliver crude oil to the\n\nMagellan Connection Point. Indeed, Enterprise’s argument is that the COD Agreement permits\n\nsuch things because it does not specifically or expressly prohibit them.35\n\n             Accordingly, the Motion for summary judgment on Magellan’s fraud claim should be\n\ndenied.\n\n     F.      BECAUSE THE MOTION IS PREMATURE IN ANY EVENT, IT COULD NOT BE GRANTED\n             BEFORE MAGELLAN HAS HAD ADEQUATE TIME TO CONDUCT RELEVANT DISCOVERY\n\n             The Enterprise Motion constitutes a no-evidence motion for summary judgment under\n\nRule 166a(i). See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). A no-evidence motion may be filed only “[a]fter\n\nadequate time for discovery.” Id. Magellan has had no discovery or opportunity for discovery, let\n\nalone the “adequate time for discovery” that Rule 166a(i) requires before a no-evidence motion\n\nfor summary judgment may be filed. Indeed, immediately after it filed the no-evidence Motion,\n\nEnterprise moved to stay any and all discovery by Magellan,36 thus ensuring that Magellan could\n\n\n35\n     Motion at 11, SOF ¶ 21.\n36\n     See Ex. 2-F.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 48\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        SR120\n\fnot have “adequate time for discovery” and compounding the impropriety of the premature no-\n\nevidence Motion. It is no answer to argue, as Enterprise has in its stay motion, that discovery is\n\n“premature” and “unnecessary” because the Court “need not and indeed cannot consider any\n\nextraneous evidence in determining the threshold legal issue raised in Enterprise’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment.”37 Enterprise has it backwards: what is premature is its no-evidence Motion,\n\nnot the discovery Enterprise has effectively blocked for the time being.38\n\n             By filing its no-evidence Motion at the virtual outset of the case, prior to any opportunity\n\nfor discovery by Magellan, Enterprise seeks to have the Court decide the whole case (all five\n\nclaims) against Magellan before Plaintiff’s case gets off the blocks—that is, before Magellan\n\n(and the Court) learn anything more about what the Enterprise personnel who actually negotiated\n\nthe contract with Magellan understood Enterprise’s “commitment” to mean and require; what\n\nEnterprise actually intended with respect to its future performance or non-performance; all the\n\nways and means Enterprise has used or is using to circumvent its commitment; the scope and\n\nmagnitude of Magellan’s damages, and other matters essential to prove Magellan’s claims at\n\ntrial.\n\n             Magellan is plainly entitled to discovery on its breach of contract claim. “Whether a\n\ncontract is ambiguous … must be decided by examining the contract as a whole in light of the\n\ncircumstances present when the contract was entered.” Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc., 352\n\nS.W.3d at 449–50 (emphasis added). Magellan has a right to discovery regarding all such\n\n\n37\n     Motion at 1.\n38\n   Ironically, Enterprise itself asserts and relies on many alleged facts that are far beyond the four corners\nof the COD Agreement, including facts relating to intent (or lack thereof), opportunity, motives for\nentering into the COD Agreement, Magellan’s alleged mindset in not objecting to certain of Enterprise’s\nactions, and the like. Apparently, Enterprise does not believe its own legal argument that the Court must\nwear blinders when it interprets the COD Agreement, examining the four corners of the document and\nnothing else.\n\nPLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT – Page 49\n{1741037;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                 SR121\n\fcircumstances, including evidence going to the parties’ respective intentions, purposes, and\n\nunderstandings of their agreement. The Court should reject Enterprise’s invitation to decide the\n\n“threshold legal issue” in a vacuum devoid of all discoverable evidence of such circumstances.\n\n             Moreover, even if the Court were persuaded that Enterprise’s interpretation of the\n\ncontract is the only reasonable one, that would not defeat Magellan’s claims for contract\n\nreformation, promissory estoppel, and/or fraud. Magellan would still be entitled to discovery\n\ninto, at a minimum, whether the contract resulted from a mutual mistake in reducing the parties’\n\nactual agreement to writing, what Enterprise’s own records show about the representations and\n\npromises it made to Magellan, and whether Enterprise had an intent not to perform when it\n\nentered into the contract or otherwise intentionally misled Magellan.39\n\n             For all the reasons discussed above, the Motion is misguided on all counts and should be\n\ndenied across the board, here and now. However, if the Court is inclined to believe that on some\n\nelement of a claim for which Magellan will have the burden of proof at trial, the evidence\n\ncurrently before the Court, along with all reasonable inferences favorable to Magellan, may not\n\nsupply the scintilla of evidence necessary to withstand a summary judgment motion, then\n\npursuant to Rule 166a(g) Magellan moves the Court to defer ruling and continue the Motion as\n\nneeded to give Magellan adequate time and opportunity to conduct discovery essential to\n\nresolution of the Motion.\n\n                                           VI.

We would like to\nrevise the definition of \"Control\" to eliminate the clauseon legalauthorization to transport. Our\naffiliate. Enterprise Crude Oil Pipeline will be transporting crude for 3,d parties under transportation\nagreement rather than a marketing agreement so only the 3,d party will have authority to determine the\nultimate destination.\n\n\nI believe the intent of the agreement was for all of the marketing volume to move through these\nconnections and that is our intent, but as soon as a 3'dparty requests a delivery outside of this\nagreement, we don't want to be in default. Please let me know if you disagree with our interpretation.\n\nOur legal folks are revising the statement and I'llforward to you, if that is acceptable. If you would\nrather have your folks revise and forward to us, please let me know. The attached doc has NOTbeen\nrevised, but I've included it anyway for review.\n\nJake Everett, P.E.\nManager.

Slower rates into an\n               ENTERPRISE Connection Facilities shall be accommodated solely at\n               ENTERPRISE's discretion. Notwithstanding the above, any deliveries\n               received into the MPL Connection Facilities in Genoa Junction destined for\n               delivery to Anahuac Junction must meet the flow rates as specified in it)\n               below for receipt through Genoa Junction.\n\n          ii) Flow rates for deUverie.~ from MPL to ENTERPRISE at Anahuac Junction\n              shall be no less than 8000 barrels per hour for the first full 12 calendar\n              months of operation and 10,700 barrels per hour thereafter. Slower flow\n              rates shall be accommodated solely at MPL's discretion.\n\n         iii) For the purposes of establishing minimum flow rate requirements, the\n               Parties will use the parameters of West Texas Intennediate crude oil,\n               specifically, an API gravity of 40 (forty) degrees and a viscosity of 10 (ten)\n               ccntistokes at 68 (sixty-eight) degrees Fahrenheit. As the API gravity and\n               viscosity change, these minimum capacity requirements will be adjusted\n               accordingly in a manner agreed upon by the Parties, i.e., as the API gravity\n               decreases and viscosity increases, the minimum flow rate requirement will\n               be reduced. For example, both ENTERPRISE and MPL must have the\n               capability to deliver andlor receive crude oil of API gravity of 40 (forty)\n               degrees and a viscosity of 10 (ten) centistokes at 68 (sixty-eight) degrees\n               Fahrenheit through Genoa Junction at the now tates described above in i).\n\n8.

Common carriers specified in this section shall be referred to as ''pipelines,\" and the owners or\nshippers of crude petroleum by pipelines shall be referred to as \"shippers.'·\n\n     (1)     All marketable on to be received for traosportadon. By the tenn \"marketable oil\" is meant any crude\npetroleum adapted for refining or fuel purposes, properly settled and containing not more than 1.0% of basic sediment,\nwater, or other impurities above a point six inches below the pipeline connection with the tank: Pipelines shalJ receive for\ntransportation all such \"marketable oil\" tendered; but no pipeline shall be required to receive for shipment from anyone\nperson an amount exceeding 3.000 balTels of petroleum in any une day; and, if th~ uil It=Jul~ed for ttan~1X>natjon differs\nmaterially in character from that usualJy produced jn the field and being transported therefrom by the pipe1in~ then it shall\nbc transported under such terms as the shipper and the owner of the pipeline may agree or the commission may require .\n     • T/';.~ deviates from TAe Rule § 3.71, pQrogrDph (1) in thaI the limit/or basic: sedimellt. water. and olher impurities is\n      1.0 % rather thail 2.0% as provided in lire rule.\n\n      (2)    Basic sediment, bow determined-temperature. In determining the amount of sediment, water, or other\nimpurities, a pipeline is authorized to make a test of the oil offered for transportation from an average sample from each\nsuch tank, by the use of centrifugal machine, or by the use of any other appliance agreed upon by the pipeline llJ1d the\nshipper. The same method of ascertaining the amount of the sediment, water, or other impurities sllall be used in the\ndelivery as in the receipt of oil. A pipeline shall not be required to receive for transportation, nor shall consignee be\nrequired to accept as a delivCT)', any oil of a higher tempcr.!turc than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, except that during the summer\noil shall be received at any atmospheric temperature, and may be delivered at like temperature. Consignee shall have the\nsame right to lest the oil upon delivery at destination that the pipeline has to test before receiving from the shipper.\n\n     (3) \"Barrel\" defined. For the purpose of these sections, a \"barrel\" of crude petroleum is declared to be 42 gallons\nof 231 cubic inches per gallon at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n      (4) Oil involved in litigation, etc.-indemnity against loss. When any oil offered for transponation is involved in\nlitigation, or the ownership is in dispute, or when the oil appears to be encumbered by lien or charge of any kind, the\npipeiine may require of shippers an indemnity bond to protect it against all loss.\n\n     (5) Storage. Each pipeline shalJ provide, without additional ohargc, sufficient storage:, sueh as is incident and\nnecessary to the transportation of oil, including storage at destination or so near thereto as to be available for prompt\ndelivery to destination point, for five days from the date of order of delivery at destination.\n\n     (6) Identity of oil, maintenance of oil. A pipeline may deliver to consignee either the identical oil received for\ntransportation, subject to such consequences of mixing with other oil as arc incident to the usual pipeline transportation, or\nit may make delivery from its common stock at destination; provided: if this la-rt be done, the delivery shall be of\nsubstantially like kind and market value.\n\n     (7) .Minimum quantity to be receh'ed. A pipeline shall not be required to receive less than one lank car-load of oil\nwhen oj] is offered for loading into tank cars at de!-1ination of the pipeline. When oil is offered for transportation for other\nthan tank car delivery, a pipeline shall no( be required to receive less than 500 barrels.\n\n      {8} Gathering charges. Tariffs to be t1Icd by a pipeline shall specify separately the charges for gathering of the oil~\nfor transportalion, and for delivery.\n\n     (9)     Measuring, testing, aDd deductions (refer~nce Special Order Number 20-63,098 effective June 18, 1973).\n\n             (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. all crude oil tendered to a pipeline shall be\n                 gauged and t~1ed by a representative of the pipeline prior to its receipt by the pipeline. The shipper may\n                  be prescnt or represented at the gauging or testing.

A pipeline may deduct the basic sediment, water, and other\n                   impurities as shown by the centrifugal or other test agreed upon by the shipper and pipeline; and 1.0% for\n                   evaporation and loss during transportation. The net balance shaU be the quantity deliverable by the\n                   pipeline. In allowing the deductions, it is not the intention of the commission to affect any tax or royalty\n                   obligations imposed by the Jaws of Texas on any producer or shipper of crude oil.\n\n            (D) A transfer of custody of crude between transporters is subject to measurement as agreed upon by the\n                transporters.\n\n     (10) Delivery and demurrage. Each pipeline shall transport oil with reasonable diligence, considering the quality\nof the oil, the distance of transponation, and other material elements, but at any time after receipt of a consignment of oil,\nupon 24 hours' notice to the consignee, may offer oil for delivery from its common stock at the point of destination,\nconfonnable to paragrapb (6) of tbis section, at a rate not exceeding 10,000 barrels per day of 24 bours. Computation of\ntime of storage (as provided for in paragraph (5) of this ~-ection) shall begin at the expiration of such notice. At the\nexpiration of the time allowed in paragraph (S) of this section for storage at destination, a pipeline may assess a demurrage\ncharge on oil offered for delivery and remaining undelivered, at a rate for the first 10 days of $.001 per barre); and\nthereafter at a rate ofS.007S per barrel, for each day of24 hours or fractional part thereof.\n\n      (11) Unpaid charges, Uen for and sale to cover. A pipeline shall have a lien on aU oil to cover charges for\ntransportation, including demurrage. and it may withhold delivery of oil until the cbarges arc paid.

The date for the sale shan be not less than 48 hours after\npublicatjon of notice in a daily newspaper of general circulation pubJished in the city where tbe general office of the\npipeline is located. The notice shall give the time and place of the sale, and the quantity of the oil to be sold. From the\nproceeds of the sale, the pipeline may deduct aU charges lawful1y accruing, including demurrage, and aJ1 expenses of the\nsale. The net balance sbalJ be paid 10 the person lawfully entitled thereto.\n\n     (12) Notice of claim.

In general, a party may obtain discovery regarding any\n                      matter that is not privileged and is relevant to the subject matter of the\n                      pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party\n                      seeking discovery or the claim or defense of any other party.

A\n                                                                person is required to produce a\n                      document or tangible thing that is within the person's possession, custody,\n                      or control.\n\nId.   (bold italics added).\n\n            Magellan’s discovery requests to date seek documents clearly relevant to the subject\n\nmatter of the action—the relationships and dealings between Magellan and Enterprise arising\n\nfrom    their   Crude Oil Distribution Agreement dated October 3], 2011            (“COD Agreement”).‘ And\n\nalthough that alone makes the requests permissible under Rule 192.3, the requests also seek\n\ninformation which           is   directly relevant to the specific claims alleged in Magellan’s Original\n\n\nPetition, including its claims for            breach of contract and fraud, and         its   alternative claims for\n\n\nreformation of contract and promissory estoppel.\n\n            First,   MagellarI’s requests to Enterprise seek documents relevant to Enterprise’ liability to\n\nMagellan, including documents showing: the circumstances surrounding the                          COD   Agreement,\n\nsuch as the business reasons                  why   Enterprise   entered   into   the     COD      Agreement; the\n\n\n4\n    See Ex.

Stay Motion\n\nat 8-12.      Indeed, Enterprise’s entire argument about overbreadth and burden                        is   premised on the\n\nvery same assertion        made     in its   Motion   for    Summary Judgment, that the COD Agreement allows\n\nEnterprise to deliberately circumvent                 its   commitment       to    make   exclusive use of the Magellan\n\nFacilities,     and thus   that    Magellan has no               right to discover the particulars about Enterprise’s\n\n\ncircumvention schemes or the extent of the resulting damages to Magellan. That                                      is   clearly\n\n\nwrong, for       all   the reasons explained in MageIlan’s response in opposition to the Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment.\n\n             Neither are Magellan’s discovery requests improperly duplicative, as Enterprise says.\n\nStay Motion at 13. While the non-parties                         may have some        responsive documents identical to\n\nresponsive documents in Enterprise’s possession, that                        is far   from a   certainty, especially since\n\n\nsome requested documents              date back a           number of     years,    and since Enterprise has previously\n\nrepresented to Magellan (in connection with Magellan’s audits) that Enterprise no longer has\n\ncertain important        documents such as        all       of the original Eagle Ford marketing agreements with\n\nthe non-parties currently          known to Magellan. Moreover, no                  case cited by Enterprise supports the\n\nproposition that a subpoena to non-party                    is   subject to being quashed merely because there              is   a\n\n\n\n\nPLAlNT|FF’S RESP.

Stay Motion               at 8. In the first place,\n\n\nEnterprise’s    argument that any “parol evidence”                will   be inadmissible at        trial is incorrect,    as\n\nshown by     the authorities cited in Magellan’s Response in Opposition to Defendant’s                        Motion     for\n\n\nSummary Judgment,           at   pages 22 and 45-46. Secondly, for discovery purposes the                     test is    not\n\nwhether the information will be admissible               at trial but   whether   it is   relevant to the subject matter\n\nof the action. See Rule l92.3(a) and              (b) (“It is not a     ground for objection that the information\n\nsought will be inadmissible at            trial if   the infonnation sought appears reasonably calculated to\n\nlead to the discovery of admissible evidence.).

Id. at   521 (Tex. 1995).         CB] Industries   is   readily distinguishable\n\nand inapplicable here, for several reasons.         5\n\n\n\nIII.       ENTERPRISE HAS        No LEGITIMATE “TRADE SECRETS” OBJECTION To ANY or\n           MAG!-3LLAN’S DISCOVERY REQUESTS\n\n           Enterprise also argues that a protective order       is   warranted on the ground that “[t]he vast\n\nmajority of Mage1lan’s requests seek information about Enterprise’s business operations and\n\nstrategies in the     Gulf coast region” and            that “[t]his information constitutes trade secrets\n\n\nbelonging to Enterprise.” Stay Motion           at 10. That, too, is     completely false and unsupported.\n\n           Without pointing the Court to any particular requests made by Magellan, Enterprise\n\noffers only a    sweeping conclusion     that “[i]n their totality, the requests          would require Enterprise\n\nto disclose its entire distribution    network and pricing          structure,   and lay open        all   of its customer\n\narrangements in the region.” Stay Motion            at 10.   That   is   sheer nonsense.       Any   close examination\n\nof Magellan’s actual requests shows         that they are carefully tailored         and reasonably conﬁned             to\n\n\ninformation plainly relevant to the subject matter of the action, the speciﬁc claims alleged, and/or\n\n\n°\n    First, the language    of the  COD   Agreement does not unambiguously favor Enterprise’s position.\nSecond,    unlike CB1 Industries, Magellan’s discovery requests seek evidence concerning the\ncircumstances surrounding the parties’ negotiation and entry into the              COD\n                                                                                  Agreement——evidence the\nCourt can and should consider in construing the          CODAgreement, notwithstanding the parol evidence\nrule.

Third, in CB] Industries the surrounding circumstance were fully developed, whereas here\n(due to the Stay Motion) they are not. See Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895102\"><a href=\"/opinion/895102/ford-motor-co-v-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664 (Tex. 2009)\n(noting that discovery was unnecessary in CB! Industries because “the facts in [that case] were\nsufficiently developed and all the relevant infonnation was at hand”). Fourth, unlike the plaintiff in CB1\nIndustries, Magellan also alleges claims for contract refonnation, promissory estoppel, and fraud. For\npurposes of those claims, parol evidence is relevant and admissible regardless of any ambiguity in the\nwritten contract. See, e.g., ISG Slate Operations, Inc. v. Nat’! Heritage Ins.

Again, that                             is   wrong,     for all the reasons explained in          Magellan’s\n\nresponse to the Motion for                     Summary Judgment.\n\n               Furthermore, to the extent any of the documents sought by Magellan                                             may    reveal\n\ninformation Enterprise                      deems   “proprietary” or “trade secret,” that                 is   only because Enterprise\n\nentered into a contractual                     commitment which              inevitably involves such information.“ In Section\n\n4.4 of the        COD Agreement, Enterprise expressly granted Magellan the right to “audit Shipper’s\n[Enterprise’s] records necessary to vertﬁz Shipper ‘s                                compliance” with      its    contractual obligations\n\nas set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the contract.” Therefore, Enterprise has no valid basis for a\n\nprotective order blocking discovery of                         all   such records, regardless of whether they include any\n\ninformation Enterprise                      may reasonably consider to be proprietary                 or “trade secret.”\n\n               Indeed,       the        case      Enterprise         cites     for     its   “trade     secret”        argument,    In     re\n\nBridgestane/Firestone, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1635307\"><a href=\"/opinion/1635307/in-re-bridgestonefirestone-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2003),‘° actually supports Magel1an’s\n\nposition. In that case, the                   Texas Supreme Court observed: “Any analysis of the necessity of trade\n\nsecret information to a fair adjudication                        must begin by examining the relationship between the\n\n7\n     See Ex.

B   at 7,   Section 4.4 (emphasis added).\n'°\n     See Stay Motion          at   I   1.\n\n\n\nPLAlNTlFF'S RESP. IN OPP.              To DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR PROTECTION AND To STAY DISCOVERY — Page 9\n4:741:54.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                SR349\n\ftrade secret information sought               and the   material elements of the parties’ claims               and defenses.”\n\nId. at    735 (emphasis added). In so noting, the Court                     relied   on a Delaware case which allowed\n\ndiscovery of the fonnula for Coca—Cola, “one of the best-kept trade secrets in the world,”\n\nbecause     it   was necessary       for the fair adjudication of the case. Id. In this case,                 it is   abundantly\n\nclear that Enterprise’s shipping records directly pertain to material elements of Magellan’s\n\nclaims and thus are discoverable, regardless of any proprietary nature of the records.\n\n           Under these circumstances, the mere                 fact that   some of Magel1an’s discovery requests may\n\nreach business information in which Enterprise has a valid “trade secret” interest, cannot warrant\n\nan order prohibiting Magellan’s discovery of such information, much                              less the blanket stay        of all\n\ndiscovery sought by Enterprise.                 Any     legitimate “trade secret” concerns are easily resolved\n\n\nthrough a confidentiality agreement/order containing appropriate limitations on the use of such\n\ninformation       (e.g., for     purposes of      this litigation only).        Although such agreement/orders are\n\ncommonplace            in   complex business      litigation like this, neither Enterprise                nor any subpoenaed\n\nnon-party        has        presented     any proposed confidentiality agreement/order                        for     Magellan’s\n\nconsideration. Instead,          and     ironically, Enterprise has effectively         blocked     all   Magellan discovery\n\npending a hearing on the Motion for                Summary Judgment,             the motion in      which Enterprise urges\n\nthe Court to dispose of            all   Magellan claims on the merits, before Magellan has any discovery\n\nwhatsoever, on the ground that Magellan has no evidence to support                         its   claims.\n\n                                                         CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons stated above, and              in   Magellan’s response to the Enterprise no-evidence\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment, the Court should deny the Stay Motion, deny the Motion                                                for\n\n\nSummary Judgment, and permit Magellan to proceed with the discovery to which                                   it   is entitled.\n\n\n\n\nPLAlNTlFF’S RESP.

In the event Magellan elects not to increase its Initial Incentive Magellan Rate\n         in any given year of the Term, Magellan reserves the right to increase its Initial\n         Incentive Magellan Rate in any subsequent year during the Term by the\n         allowable cumulative percentage increase foregone by Magellan in prior years.\n\n      C. In addition to and not subject to the limitations set forth above, in the event\n         Magellan is required by a change from the Law as it existed on the Effective\n         Date to: (i) make signiﬁcant improvements to all or any portion of the Magellan\n         Facilities or (ii) to incur signiﬁcant additional expenses for public safety,\n         pollution control or for any other reason with respect to the Magellan Facilities,\n         and the effect of the cost and expense thereof to Magellan is not reflected in the\n         Oil Pipeline Index, Magellan may increase the Initial Incentive Magellan Rate\n         to reflect the effect of such costs and expenses incurred by Magellan to comply\n         with such change in Law. Magellan shall notify Shipper, not less than ninety\n         (90) days prior to the implementation of any increase in the Initial Incentive\n         Magellan Rate under this Section 3.3(C), of the amount of such proposed\n         increase, the reason for such increase and the method of calculating such\n         increase. Shipper shall have the right to notify Magellan within thirty (30) days\n         after Shipper receives Magellan’s notice, of Shipper's decision not to pay such\n         increase. If Shipper fails to timely notify Magellan of its decision, then it shall\n         be deemed for purposes of this Agreement that Shipper accepts and approves\n         such increase. If Shipper notiﬁes Magellan that it will not accept such increase\n         then such increase shall be null and void, but Magellan shall have the right to\n         terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) days after Magellan receives\n         Shipper’s notice in which case neither Party shall have any further obligations\n         to the other Party hereunder except as to obligations already accrued.

DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS\n\n                    DEFENDANT'S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF\n                     MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n\n      Defendant Enterprise Crude Oil, LLC files its reply in support of its motion\n\nfor summary judgment, responding to the arguments made by Magellan Crude Oil\n\nPipeline Company, L.P., as follows:\n\n                                 INTRODUCTION\n\n      Despite Magellan's attempts to complicate this case and confuse the issues,\n\nthe case presents a straightforward question of contract construction. As explained\n\nin Enterprise's motion and in the sections below, the plain and unambiguous\n\nlanguage of the Distribution Agreement defeats Magellan's breach of contract claim\n\nas a matter of law, and Magellan's remaining claims also fail.\n\n                          ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.    Enterprise's traditional summary judgment motion should be\n      granted because the proper construction of the Distribution\n      Agreement disposes of the entire case.\n\n      Enterprise has filed a traditional summary judgment motion under Rule\n\n166a(c). Enterprise attached supporting evidence to its motion—most significantly\n\nthe subject contract—and invoked the standard for traditional summary judgment\n\nDefendant's Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment                   Pagei\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  SR367\n\fmotions.1 Enterprise’s motion does not invoke the no-evidence rule—Rule 166a(i)—\n\nand does not follow the procedures for no-evidence motions. Instead, Enterprise\n\nseeks an expeditious end to Magellan’s frivolous lawsuit via traditional summary\n\njudgment, which is particularly appropriate when the controversy can be resolved\n\nby the proper construction of an unambiguous contract.             See Lopez v. Munoz,\n\nHockema & Reed, L.L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617-18 (Tex. 2000).\n\n          Like a diligent propagandist, Magellan repeats over and over and over that\n\nEnterprise’s motion is a “no-evidence” motion. It manifestly is not, and the Court\n\nshould see through Magellan’s transparent attempt to keep its lawsuit alive by\n\nclaiming that an adequate time for discovery has not elapsed.\n\nB.        Magellan’s breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law based on\n          the plain and unambiguous language of the Distribution Agreement.\n\n          1.         The language of the Distribution Agreement defeats Magellan’s\n                     breach of contract claim because it defines the limits of\n                     Enterprise’s obligation under this requirements contract.\n\n          This is a contract interpretation case. Although the parties agree on the\n\nrules of contract construction, Magellan turns those rules upside down and\n\nbackwards to twist the Distribution Agreement to state terms it manifestly does not\n\nstate. The starting point for the analysis is the actual language of the Distribution\n\nAgreement. And the actual language unequivocally defeats Magellan’s claims:\n\n          4.1   Transportation Commitment. Following the In-Service Date,\n          Shipper [Enterprise] agrees:\n\n                     A.     to exclusively utilize the Magellan Facilities for all\n                     deliveries of Product that are Owned or Controlled by\n                     Shipper; and\n\n1   Motion, at 13.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                          PAGE 2\n\n\n\n                                                                                              SR368\n\f                  B.    to use best efforts to cause Shipper’s Affiliates to\n                  exclusively use the Magellan Facilities for all deliveries of\n                  Product that are Owned or Controlled by any of its\n                  Affiliates;\n\n                provided, that such deliveries are made from an Origin Point\n          and are either:\n\n                          (i)     transported on the Eagle Ford Pipeline System\n                                  through Echo Terminal to the Connection Point\n                                  and delivered to any of the Destination Points, or\n\n                          (ii)    transported on the Eagle Ford Pipeline System to\n                                  the Connection Point and delivered to any of the\n                                  Destination Points2\n\nThat language is clear and unambiguous. The Distribution Agreement is a type of\n\nrequirements contract, in which Enterprise agreed to use the Magellan Facilities to\n\ntransport a subset of the crude oil coming out of the Eagle Ford Shale, i.e., those\n\nbarrels that met the requirements expressly set forth in Section 4.1. Magellan’s\n\nbreach of contract claim does not allege that Enterprise failed to utilize the\n\nMagellan Facilities for crude oil that met the requirements of Section 4.1. Instead,\n\nMagellan alleges that Enterprise breached the Distribution Agreement by not\n\npaying Magellan for crude oil that does not meet the requirements of Section 4.1.\n\nBecause Magellan’s claim is based upon an invalid interpretation of the contract, as\n\na matter of law Enterprise is entitled to judgment on that claim as a matter of law.\n\n          Magellan’s unsupported and unexplained effort to evade the clear language of\n\nthe Distribution Agreement, is wrong as a matter of law. As noted in a leading\n\ntreatise, “[i]n a requirements contract the quantity term is not fixed at the time of\n\ncontracting.

Here, the quantity of crude oil to be\n\ntransported on the Magellan Facilities is not fixed in the Distribution Agreement,\n\nand Magellan tacitly concedes this point, making no contrary argument in its\n\nresponse. Instead, the parties agreed that Enterprise’s crude oil shipments meeting\n\ncertain requirements would be transported on the Magellan Facilities. Therefore,\n\nthe Distribution Agreement necessarily is a requirements contract. Otherwise the\n\nDistribution Agreement would fail for indefiniteness. See, e.g., Cox, Inc. v.

There is\n\nsimply no language in the Distribution Agreement itself or law supporting\n\nMagellan’s argument that the agreement requires Enterprise to use the Magellan\n\nFacilities exclusively for all deliveries of crude that are owned or controlled by\n\nEnterprise or its affiliates. The requirements in Section 4.1 are not “covenants”\n\n4The fact that Enterprise has paid Magellan more than $8.2 million under the Distribution\nAgreement also defeats an argument that it is illusory.

To have imposed those kinds of\n\nobligations, the Distribution Agreement would need to state that “Enterprise shall\n\nexclusively accept deliveries of crude at Origin Points,” 5 that “Enterprise shall\n\nexclusively route crude through the Connection Point,” or that “Enterprise shall\n\nexclusively deliver crude to Destination Points.” But it doesn’t say that. And any\n\ncontrary conclusion would render an additional requirement to route through the\n\nConnection Point to a Destination Point superfluous because the function of the\n\nMagellan Facilities is to connect the Connection Point (Genoa Junction) with the\n\nDestination Points.

In Northern\n\nNatural Gas, the decisions to cancel and not renew the dedicated gas purchase\n\nagreements were within Northern’s control. Northern Natural Gas Co., 986 S.W.2d\n\nat 604-05. Under Magellan’s logic, however, Northern should have been obligated\n\nto keep those contracts in effect so that it would continue to buy gas it was obligated\n\nto send to Conoco for processing. That is not the law. The Texas Supreme Court\n\nflatly rejected Magellan’s position.   Id. at 606.   Likewise, in Keyes Helium, the\n\ndecision to close the Lakin Plant was within the control of Regency. Keyes Helium\n\nCo., 393 S.W.3d at 860-61. Therefore, according to Magellan, Regency should have\n\nbeen obligated to keep the plant open so that it would continue to supply helium to\n\nKeyes. The Dallas Court of Appeals rejected that position. Id. at 864. Magellan’s\n\ntheory and interpretation of the Distribution Agreement is therefore directly\n\ncontrary to controlling law, and must be rejected.\n\n          4.      Magellan’s interpretation would render          the   Distribution\n                  Agreement an illegal restraint on trade.\n\n          In an effort to manufacture ambiguity and create a fact issue, Magellan\n\ncontends that crude “Owned” or “Controlled” by Enterprise at any Origin Point, or\n\n\n6   See infra Section B.4.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                    PAGE 11\n\n\n\n                                                                                          SR377\n\fowned or controlled by Enterprise “at any time or place along the route between\n\nOrigin Point and Destination Point,” 7 must be transported on the Magellan\n\nFacilities. That is, Magellan argues that even if Enterprise sells the crude to a\n\nthird party at ECHO Terminal, or buys Eagle Ford crude at ECHO Terminal and\n\nthen sells it along the route, 8 Enterprise is required to compel its buyer to move\n\nthe crude through Magellan’s Genoa Junction and along the Magellan Facilities.9\n\nFurther, Enterprise’s affiliate, EPO, must refuse to do business with the buyer,\n\nbecause, according to Magellan, by entering into the Distribution Agreement\n\nEnterprise agreed to forego the use of “its own competing facilities” to transport the\n\ncrude.10\n\n       The problem is that such an agreement is per se unlawful. What Magellan\n\nposits as “the only reasonable interpretation of Section 4.1” is in practical effect an\n\nagreement among horizontal competitors to divide the transportation market for\n\ncrude produced in the Eagle Ford basin. Further, it is an agreement to induce or\n\ncoerce crude producers and purchasers to boycott all transportation facilities other\n\nthan the Magellan Facilities by conditioning an essential input–transport on\n\nEnterprise’s Eagle Ford Pipeline–on doing business with Magellan to the exclusion\n\nof all others. Such an agreement would be a naked restraint on trade and unlawful\n\n\n7 Magellan Resp. Br. at 41.\n8 This is itself a practical impossibility, further refuting Magellan’s interpretation. Crude is not\nsegregated at ECHO based on the crude’s origin; it is aggregated there based on quality with crude\nfrom various sources, and there is no way to determine whether any particular batch of crude\npurchased at ECHO was produced from an Origin Point.\n9 Notably, Magellan’s position in this regard is directly contrary to the plain language of Section 4.1\n\nof the Distribution Agreement stating that Enterprise shall use its “best efforts” to cause its\ncustomers to use the Magellan Facilities. It does not say Enterprise shall compel or require its\ncustomers to do so. See Original Petition, Ex. A, § 4.1.\n10 Magellan Resp.

Accordingly, this\n\nCourt may not permissibly, as Magellan suggests, consider the affidavit or the\n\nemail in determining whether an ambiguity exists. Instead, this Court must first\n\ndetermine as a matter of law based on the four corners of the Distribution\n\nAgreement itself, whether an ambiguity exists. And it must do so without\n\nconsideration of the evidence Magellan has offered.\n\n          Because Magellan knows these basic rules of contract construction prohibit\n\nthe Court from considering its evidence, Magellan characterizes its parol evidence\n\nas merely evidence of the “circumstances present when the contract was entered.”13\n\nThe cases Magellan cites in support of this proposition, however, do not support its\n\n13   Magellan’s Resp.

For example, in Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l v.

Then the court did precisely what this Court should do here—it first\n\nfocused solely on the language of the agreement itself. Id. at 452. In doing so, it\n\nconcluded that the contract at issue was not ambiguous and that consequently, the\n\nextrinsic evidence the trial court considered in error was “of limited relevance” and\n\n“[could not] be used to show the parties’ motives or intentions apart from the [ ]\n\nAgreement.” Id.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court reached a similar result in First Bank v.

In that case, the court similarly\n\nconstrued the language of the contract at issue, determined that it was not\n\nambiguous, and therefore concluded that the trial court erred in (1) submitting the\n\nissue to the jury at all; and (2) instructing the jury that it could consider extrinsic\n\nevidence to add an unwritten term to an unambiguous written agreement. Id. at\n\n106 (holding that “when a written contract is unambiguous . . . extrinsic evidence is\n\nsimply irrelevant and inadmissible on that issue. In such a case, the trial court can\n\nneither submit the issue to a jury nor rely on extrinsic evidence to add terms to the\n\nparties’ unambiguous agreement.”). The Court in First Bank did not stop there,\n\nhowever. It further clarified its holding in Basic Capital Management v. Dynex\n\nCommercial, upon which Magellan also relies for the erroneous proposition that its\n\nextrinsic evidence here may be considered as evidence of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the Distribution Agreement. Specifically, the Court stated:\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                    PAGE 16\n\n\n\n                                                                                          SR382\n\f          . . . references to “circumstances” surrounding a contract recognize that\n          evidence of the circumstances may assist courts in construing the language\n          the parties used, but they do not authorize courts to rely on such evidence to\n          add to or alter the terms contained within the agreement itself. When\n          parties ‘have a valid, integrated written agreement,’ the parol-evidence rule\n          ‘precludes enforcement of prior or contemporaneous agreements.” . . . courts\n          may not rely on evidence of surrounding circumstances to make the language\n          say what it unambiguously does not say.\n\nId. at 109-110 (internal citations omitted).\n\n          The same analyses that the Texas Supreme Court applied in the cases above\n\nwhen applied here demand a similar result.

Contrary to Magellan’s argument, the letter agreement relating\n                  to the Joint Tariff does not amend or alter the Distribution\n                  Agreement.\n\n          Magellan’s attempt to change the meaning of the Distribution Agreement by\n\nwhat it refers to as the “Joint Tariff Agreement” is disingenuous and baseless.\n\nMagellan falsely claims that the “Joint Tariff Agreement” expresses Enterprise’s\n\ncommitment and quotes a portion of that letter agreement. The full quote makes\n\nclear that the “shipper” referenced in the Joint Tariff Agreement refers to third-\n\nparty shippers—not Enterprise:\n\n          Magellan and Enterprise agree to offer an incentive program under the\n          Joint Tariff to shippers that enter into a ten (10) year agreement with\n          Magellan pursuant to which the shipper agrees to ship under the Joint\n          Tariff all crude oil owned or controlled by it from an Origin Point\n          through the Connection Point and to a Destination Point. The Joint\n          Tariff rate under the incentive program will be equal to or less than\n          the sum of the Enterprise local tariff and the Initial Incentive\n          Magellan Rate (as hereinafter defined).17\n\nMoreover, it identifies Enterprise as a “Participating Carrier,” not as a “shipper.”\n\nThe letter agreement refers to an incentive program under which Magellan and\n\nEnterprise are the carriers and contemplates separate agreements with third party\n\nshippers. It does not purport to restate, modify, or amend Enterprise’s obligation\n\n16   Magellan’s Resp. Br., Ex. 1 at ¶ 9,11.\n17   Magellan’s Resp.

Indeed, it does not reference or mention the\n\nDistribution Agreement at all. Instead, the letter agreement expressly states that\n\nits purpose is to confirm an agreement to establish a joint tariff. The Joint Tariff\n\nitself does not purport to require anyone, let alone Enterprise, to transport crude\n\non any particular routing.18 Rather, it merely sets forth the rates that will be\n\navailable to third party shippers who qualify as a “Participating Shipper.”\n\nMagellan’s argument is baseless.\n\nC.        Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim fails along with its breach of\n          contract claim and also fails because it is merely duplicative of its\n          breach of contract claim.\n\n          Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim is based on the same flawed\n\ninterpretation of the Distribution Agreement that underlies its breach of contract\n\nclaim. Because Magellan’s interpretation is wrong as a matter of law, not only does\n\nits breach of contract claim fail, but also its declaratory judgment claim necessarily\n\nfails for the same reasons.\n\n          Additionally, Magellan’s declaratory judgment claim is not justiciable\n\nbecause the issues sought to be resolved are already pending in this suit via\n\nMagellan’s breach of contract claim.

The express language of the Distribution Agreement bars justifiable\n      reliance, which precludes Magellan from maintaining a fraud claim.\n\n      Magellan makes three primary arguments in an effort to salvage its fraud\n\nclaim, none of which is availing. First, Magellan contends (again) that Enterprise\n\nfiled a “no-evidence” motion for summary judgment, which can be defeated through\n\npresentation of merely a scintilla of evidence.    For the reasons noted above in\n\nSection A, this is incorrect. Enterprise has moved under Rule 166a(c), because the\n\nterms of the Distribution Agreement affirmatively disprove the element of\n\njustifiable reliance. Second, Magellan asserts that Enterprise’s interpretation of the\n\nDistribution Agreement is unreasonable. As detailed in Enterprise’s motion and in\n\nthis reply, a review of the plain and unambiguous language of the agreement proves\n\notherwise.   And, third, Enterprise claims that the terms of the Distribution\n\nAgreement do not disprove reliance because the agreement’s language does not\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT                   PAGE 24\n\n\n\n                                                                                         SR390\n\fdirectly contradict the alleged representation that all of Enterprise’s marketing\n\nvolumes would move through Magellan’s facilities.         For the reasons below, that\n\nargument likewise fails.\n\n      As an initial matter, the statement Magellan claims to have relied upon, that\n\n“all marketing volumes” would be subject to the Distribution Agreement, is plainly\n\nnot true under either party’s reading of the agreement. Even Magellan recognizes\n\nthat the subset of crude subject to the Distribution Agreement is defined and\n\nlimited by the terms of Section 4.1.      For this reason alone, Magellan’s alleged\n\nreliance on such a statement is unreasonable and therefore unjustified. Indeed, this\n\nwould be true even if the statement were “all marketing volumes originating from\n\nthe Origin Points” (it was not), because crude arriving at places other than the\n\nDestination Points are unambiguously excluded. In this respect, then, Section 4.1—\n\neven as interpreted by Magellan—directly contradicts the claimed representation.\n\n      Nevertheless, Magellan contends that its subjective understanding27 of the\n\nterm “marketing volumes” can be a basis for fraud because the terms of the\n\nDistribution Agreement do not directly and expressly contradict its belief that these\n\ntwo words mean that any crude Enterprise owned or controlled at an Origin Point is\n\nforever subject to the agreement, regardless of any subsequent change in title, its\n\nultimate destination, or its routing along the way. This is, of course, directly and\n\nexpressly contradicted by the agreement, which defines “Owned” and “Controlled”\n\nto exclude crude transported “for the account of a party or parties other than\n\n\n27See Magellan Resp.

In that case, the plaintiff alleged that it was induced to\n\nenter a contract becoming a General Agent on a promise that, post-execution, it\n\nwould become a Managing Agent and its contractor would be demoted to General\n\nAgent under it. The contract did not address—either positively or negatively—the\n\nchanging of titles. Nevertheless, the fact that the plaintiff entered a contract to\n\nbecome a General Agent, combined with the contract’s merger clause, 29 was\n\nsufficient to negate reliance on any promise. Id.\n\n       Here, Magellan entered into a contract that specified the requirements for\n\ncrude to be subject to the agreement, and they are: (1) that the crude be Owned or\n\nControlled by Enterprise or an affiliate; (2) that the crude come from an Origin\n\nPoint; (3) that it travel through the Connection Point; and (4) that it arrive at a\n\nDestination Point.       Any statement that crude not meeting these requirements\n\nwould nevertheless be subject to the agreement directly contradicts these express\n\nterms, and is, as a matter of law, unjustifiable. See DRC Parts, 112 S.W.3d at 858-\n\n\n\n\n29 Here, too, the Distribution Agreement provides that “[t]his Agreement between the Parties\ncomprises the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and\nthere are no agreements, understandings, requirements, warranties or representations, oral or\nwritten, expressed or implied, that are not merged herein or superseded hereby, other than as set\nforth in the Joint Tariff.” Distr. Agr. § 9.7. Where a contract is negotiated at arms-length by\nsophisticated businessmen represented by counsel, this type of “merger” clause, is enforceable and\nnegates reliance on any alleged oral representations, an essential element of fraud as set out in the\ncharge above.

Two Thirty Nine J.V., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894601\"><a href=\"/opinion/894601/joe-v-two-thirty-nine-joint-venture/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 161 (Tex. 2004) (quoting Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(g)) (emphasis\n\nadded). Here, however, there are no affidavits attached to Magellan’s summary\n\njudgment response explaining why Magellan cannot, by its own affidavit, present\n\nfacts essential to justify its opposition. So Magellan is not entitled to a continuance.\n\n      Second,    Magellan’s   request   should    be   denied   because   discovery   is\n\nunnecessary. As Enterprise has explained in its motion, and reinforced above, the\n\nDistribution Agreement is not ambiguous and must be construed as a matter of\n\nlaw. So there are no fact issues and no discovery is required. See, e.g., Nat’l Union\n\nFire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v.

That proper construction vitiates all of\n\nMagellan’s claims, and those patently unmeritorious claims should be eliminated\n\nthrough summary judgment. See Swilley v.

Magellan has always\n\nagreed that a protective order is appropriate and has remained willing to negotiate over reasonable\n\nterms that provide adequate protection while not preventing either party from preparing its case.\n\nBut, through the use of hyperbole and unsupported accusations, Enterprise has attempted to turn\n\nthe protective order discussions into a trial over Magellan’s motives in seeking and using\n\ndiscovery.\n\n             Despite lengthy negotiations after the December 4, 2017 hearing on compromise forms of\n\nprotective order proposed by Magellan, Enterprise’s counsel failed to send the compromise revised\n\nform he promised, instead proposing that Magellan scrap all other proposals and agree to a form\n\nentered into in another unrelated case in a different jurisdiction that was based on the form of order\n\naccepted by that jurisdiction.\n\n               At a Minimum, Revisions Are Necessary to Enterprise’s Proposed Form\n\n             The protective order proposed by Enterprise is not appropriate in this case in the form in\n\nwhich Enterprise proposed it.

To highlight, the following necessary revisions\n\nhave been made:\n\n                •   The list of “Qualified Persons” who have the ability to view information designated\n                    “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only” has been expanded to include:\n\n                        o In-house counsel actively assisting in the litigation and whose job is to\n                          manage litigation. Specifically excluded are in-house counsel who make or\n                          participate in competitive business matters of the parties.\n                        o Auditors employed by the parties.\n                        o Witnesses currently employed by the parties or witnesses who were\n                          employed by the parties at the time the designated information was\n                          generated.\n                        o Court reporters, as well as litigation vendors and other litigation support\n                          personnel.\n\n                •   The description of how material will be designated “For Counsel Only” or\n                    “Attorneys Eyes Only” has been clarified to describe that if only a portion of a\n                    document is “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only”, then only that portion\n                    will be noted as such, allowing the rest of the document that is either not “Classified\n                    Information” or is only “Confidential” to be treated as such.\n\n                •   With the expansion of the list of “Qualified Persons” who can review “For Counsel\n                    Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only” information, the provision requiring all materials\n                    designated as such be maintained at the offices of counsel or experts has been\n                    removed.\n\n                •   The requirement that a party log all “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only”\n                    documents shown to Qualified Persons has been removed.\n\n                •   The procedure for challenging designation as a Qualified Person, which had no\n                    correlating procedure for designating someone as a Qualified Person, has been\n                    removed.\n\n                •   The procedure for returning documents has been modified to allow retained counsel\n                    to maintain one copy of documents produced in this case and designated as\n                    Classified Information.\n\n             As noted in prior filings, this case centers on a Crude Oil Distribution (“COD”) Agreement\n\nthat specifically provides Magellan “the right to audit Shipper’s [Enterprise’s] records necessary\n\nto verify Shipper’s [Enterprise’s] compliance with the provisions of Sections 4.1 [Transportation\n\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 2\n{1773121;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                              SR399\n\fCommitment] and 4.2 [Transportation Commitment Exceptions].” The parties in this case agreed\n\nthat Magellan has a right to inspect the information that is the subject of discovery in this case, and\n\nEnterprise agreed that an audit of the information is appropriate. Limiting access to information\n\nproduced by Enterprise in this case to retained counsel will unfairly and unreasonably hamstring\n\nthe ability of Magellan’s retained counsel to consult with their client as necessary to prepare\n\nMagellan’s case. Despite the attempt by Enterprise to portray this dispute as a simple issue of\n\nvolumes, the filings to date and those attached to this supplement reveal that the issues are\n\ncomplicated and require persons who understand the business that is the subject of the COD\n\nAgreement to analyze the information to determine whether Enterprise has complied with its\n\nobligations under the COD Agreement.\n\n             And to the extent that Enterprise contends that the limits it seeks to impose will apply to a\n\nsmall subset of documents, that contention is counter to Enterprise’s many filings in this case to\n\ndate, including its filing with the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Judicial District. For example, in\n\nits response to Magellan’s motion to compel Enterprise to produce documents responsive to its\n\nrequests for production, Enterprise stated:\n\n                    Subject to the entry of a protective order, Enterprise has already\n                    agreed to produce any communications regarding the conversion of\n                    business arrangements for crude transported from the Origin Points,\n                    and any communications that discuss Magellan or the Distribution\n                    Agreement. Enterprise has also agreed to provide summary volume\n                    information for the “relevant period” defined in the requests (similar\n                    to information Enterprise already produced during the audits subject\n                    to a Confidentiality Agreement). The remaining documents,\n                    however, reveal Enterprise’s trade secrets and they must be shielded\n                    from discovery under Texas Rule of Evidence 507 absent a showing\n                    by Magellan that such information is necessary to its case.\n\n(Enter. Resp. to Mot. to Compel, p.6) (Emphasis added).\n\n             Accordingly, not only is it necessary that the list of Qualified Persons be slightly broader\n\nthan retained counsel, it is necessary that the Protective Order require a party designating\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT.

This is shown by the fact that prior to the December 4,\n\n2017 hearing on Magellan’s Motion to Compel, Enterprise had not produced one document\n\nresponsive to Magellan’s requests. And, since that date, Enterprise has produced to Magellan only\n\na small set of documents that appear to be the same as the documents previously provided to\n\nMagellan in its contractually-permitted audits.\n\n              Enterprise’s Shifting Positions May Require the Court to Revisit This Issue\n\n             Regardless of which form of Protective Order the Court enters, it may need to be modified\n\nonce the details of Enterprise’s production and confidentiality designations become clearer than\n\nthey are now. To date, Enterprise’s has made so many conflicting and inconsistent representations\n\nthat it is impossible to know how much information Enterprise will be producing, from what\n\nsource(s),1 what specific information Enterprise deems to be “trade secret,” 2 and whether the trade\n\n\n1\n  In Magellan’s pre-suit audits, Enterprise provided some information which apparently came from\nEnterprise Pipeline (its pipeline affiliate), and in its original responses to the discovery requests Magellan\nserved on July 21, 2017, Enterprise did not object on the ground that the requests seek documents possessed\nor controlled by Enterprise Pipeline, although Enterprise objected on every other imaginable ground. See\nEx. 3. However, in the Amended Objections Enterprise served on the eve of the December 4, 2017\ndiscovery hearings, Enterprise stated for the first time that it will not produce its affiliates’ documents. See\nEx. 4.\n2\n  Enterprise has consistently refused to identify, specifically, the responsive information for which it claims\ntrade secret protection, relying instead on a general “compilation” theory that practically all of its business\ninformation is trade secret. And even that is a moving target, as can be seen by comparing Enterprise’s\noriginal objections to Magellan’s discovery requests (Ex. 3) to its amended objections (Ex. 4). Among many\nother changes, the amended objections Enterprise served on the eve of the December 4, 2017 discovery\nhearing dropped its previously asserted trade secret objections to seven of Magellan requests for production,\nincluding RFPs 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 30, and 31.\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 4\n{1773121;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                   SR401\n\fsecret information Enterprise seeks to restrict to Magellan’s outside counsel’s eyes only, is\n\nminimal or voluminous.\n\n             For example, Enterprise never claimed that the any of the information it provided to\n\nMagellan during the course of Magellan’s pre-suit audits is “trade secret” information, and it never\n\nsought to prevent any of Magellan’s auditors or business personnel from reviewing that\n\ninformation.3 However, Enterprise’s discovery responses indicate that Enterprise now claims\n\n“trade secret” protection for all the information it provided to Magellan during the pre-suit audits,\n\nalong with all other information necessary to trace the movement of Eagle Ford barrels from an\n\nOrigin Point to a final destination point or to verify Enterprise’s assertions; i.e., that to the extent\n\nEnterprise is required to produce such information in this case, it seeks or may seek to restrict\n\nreview to Magellan’s outside counsel only. 1\n\n             Enterprise’s representations to this Court, and to the Court of Appeals, portend just such\n\nan overly broad designation of “trade secret” information, in an effort to unfairly and improperly\n\nhamstring Magellan’s ability to understand and utilize discovery obtained in this litigation, for this\n\n\n3\n  Such information included copies of some transportation agreements and some Eagle Ford crude oil\npurchase contracts or buy-sell contracts between Enterprise and its customers, without redaction of\ncustomer identities and most of the terms of the contracts. By emails, Enterprise also provided partial\ninformation, or unverified assertions, that: (i) Enterprise batches a common stream barrel at the Origin\nPoints and sells a common stream barrel at the applicable destination but does not tie a specific Origin Point\nto a barrel sold at a different location; (ii) Enterprise sells barrels that come from an Eagle Ford Origin Point\nto unaffiliated third parties at ECHO Terminal, Genoa Junction, or other destinations; (iii) deliveries\nEnterprise makes from an Origin Point to its ECHO Terminal do not go through the Magellan connection\npoint [at Genoa Junction] prior to delivery to a final destination; and (iv) when Enterprise sells Eagle Ford\nbarrels to a customer at ECHO Terminal, Enterprise does not track subsequent transportation thereof to any\nfinal destination. Yet Enterprise also asserted that certain barrels were delivered through Enterprise\nfacilities (not Magellan facilities) based on transportation nominations made by Enterprise’s customers, and\nthat some product was transported by a customer from ECHO Terminal to a designated Destination Point,\nbut not through the Magellan facilities, because that was “not the most direct routing.” See emails identified\nas Ex. 5. Pending determination whether and to what extent (if any) the Enterprise emails are properly\ndesignated as confidential information, Magellan has omitted them from the copy of this Supplement filed\nin the public record. Magellan will provide Exhibit 5 to the Court and will comply with the Court’s direction\nregarding filing the same in some redacted version, or under seal if appropriate, following the hearing.\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 5\n{1773121;}\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                    SR402\n\flitigation. Whenever Enterprise attempts to justify its refusal to produce the vast majority of the\n\nrequested documents, or to persuade the Court of Appeals that this Court’s order compelling\n\nproduction is an abuse of discretion, Enterprise represents that “most of Magellan’s requests are\n\naimed at obtaining discovery of Enterprise’s trade secrets,”4 and that this Court’s order compelling\n\nproduction encompasses “volumes of proven trade secrets.”5 Yet when Enterprise urges this Court\n\nto impose draconian restrictions on Magellan’s ability to use any “trade secret” information\n\nEnterprise may produce, it represents the opposite, that the trade secret documents will only\n\namount to a “select group of highly sensitive information.”6\n\n                                                 Conclusion\n\n             While a protective order is warranted in this case, the facts presented to this Court do not\n\nsupport entry of the protective order Enterprise seeks. Enterprise objected to almost all of\n\nMagellan’s discovery requests to it and the nonparties as seeking trade secrets and is pursuing a\n\nwrit of mandamus on the same grounds. To limit Magellan’s review of this information to only\n\nMagellan’s retained counsel would make preparation of this case extremely and unnecessarily\n\ndifficult and expensive. Under Enterprise’s proposal, only outside counsel or experts could review\n\ninformation Enterprise now claims to be “trade secret.” Given the audit right provided in the\n\ncontract at issue, and the fact Enterprise previously provided Magellan information in the audits\n\ndid not claim (but now contends) is trade secret, the modestly broader list of authorized persons\n\nproposed by Magellan in the revised protective order is appropriate. For all of these reasons, and\n\nthose previously described in its response to Enterprise’s motion, Magellan respectfully urges the\n\nCourt to approve the protective order attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n\n\n4\n    See Defendant’s Response to Motion to Compel, p. 1.\n5\n    Defendant’s Petition for Writ of Mandamus, p. 25, excerpt attached as Ex. 6 (emphasis added).\n6\n    See Defendant’s Motion for Entry of a Protective Order, p. 1 (emphasis added).\nPLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.’S MOT.

For purposes of this order, so-designated\n information includes, but is not limited to, product formula information, design information, non-\n public financial information, pricing information, customer identification data, and certain study\n methodologies.\n\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 23\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               SR420\n\f         d.      Ultrasensitive Information. At this point, the parties do not anticipate the need for higher\n levels of confidentiality as to ultrasensitive documents or information. However, in the event that a\n court orders that ultrasensitive documents or information be produced, the parties will negotiate and\n ask the court to enter an ultrasensitive information protocol in advance of production to further\n protect such information.\n\n     4. Use of Classified Information\n\n     All Classified Information provided by any party or nonparty in the course of this litigation shall\n be used solely for the purpose of preparation, trial, and appeal of this litigation and for no other\n purpose, and shall not be disclosed except in accordance with the terms hereof.\n\n     5. Marking of Documents\n\n     Documents provided in this litigation may be designated by the producing person or by any party\n as Classified Information by marking each page of the documents so designated with a stamp\n indicating that the information is “Confidential”, “For Counsel Only”, or “Attorneys Eyes Only”. If\n only part of a document is designated “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys Eyes Only”, the designating\n party shall produce two copies of the item—one copy with the “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys\n Eyes Only” information noted but visible, and one copy with the “For Counsel Only” or “Attorneys\n Eyes Only” information shielded from visibility. In lieu of marking the original of a document, if the\n original is not provided, the designating party may mark the copies that are provided. Originals shall\n be preserved for inspection.\n\n     6. Disclosure at Depositions\n\n     Information disclosed at (a) the deposition of a party or one of its present or former officers,\n directors, employees, agents, consultants, representatives, or independent experts retained by counsel\n for the purpose of this litigation, or (b) the deposition of a nonparty may be designated by any party\n as Classified Information by indicating on the record at the deposition that the testimony is\n “Confidential” or “For Counsel Only” and is subject to the provisions of this Order.\n\n     Any party also may designate information disclosed at a deposition as Classified Information by\n notifying all parties in writing not later than 10 days of receipt of the transcript of the specific pages\n and lines of the transcript that should be treated as Classified Information thereafter. Each party shall\n attach a copy of each such written notice to the face of the transcript and each copy thereof in that\n party’s possession, custody, or control. All deposition transcripts shall be treated as For Counsel Only\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 24\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                SR421\n\f for a period of 10 days after initial receipt of the transcript.\n\n     To the extent possible, the court reporter shall segregate into separate transcripts information\n designated as Classified Information with blank, consecutively numbered pages being provided in a\n nondesignated main transcript. The separate transcript containing Classified Information shall have\n page numbers that correspond to the blank pages in the main transcript.\n\n     Counsel for a party or a nonparty witness shall have the right to exclude from depositions any\n person who is not authorized to receive Classified Information pursuant to this Protective Order, but\n such right of exclusion shall be applicable only during periods of examination or testimony during\n which Classified Information is being used or discussed.\n\n     7. Disclosure to Qualified Persons\n\n     To Whom. Classified Information shall not be disclosed or made available by the receiving party\nto persons other than Qualified Persons except as necessary to comply with applicable law or the\nvalid order of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that in the event of a disclosure\ncompelled by law or court order, the receiving party will so notify the producing party as promptly as\npracticable (if at all possible, prior to making such disclosure) and shall seek a protective order or\nconfidential treatment of such information. Information designated as For Counsel Only shall be\nrestricted in circulation to Qualified Persons described in subparagraph 2(a).\n\n         a. Retention of Copies During this Litigation. Copies of For Counsel Only information shall be\n maintained only in the offices of outside counsel for the receiving party and, to the extent supplied to\n experts described in subparagraph 2(a)(ii), in the offices of those experts. Any documents produced\n in this litigation, regardless of classification, that are provided to Qualified Persons shall be maintained\n only at the office of such Qualified Person and only necessary working copies of any such documents\n shall be made. Copies of documents and exhibits containing Classified Information may be prepared\n by independent copy services, printers, or illustrators for the purpose of this litigation.\n\n         b. Each party’s outside counsel shall maintain a log of all copies of For Counsel Only\n documents that are delivered to Qualified Persons.\n\n     8. Unintentional Disclosures\n\n     Documents unintentionally produced without designation as Classified Information later may be\n designated and shall be treated as Classified Information from the date written notice of the\n\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 25\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                SR422\n\f designation is provided to the receiving party.\n\n     If a receiving party learns of any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential information or For\n Counsel Only information, the party shall immediately upon learning of such disclosure inform the\n producing party of all pertinent facts relating to such disclosure and shall make all reasonable efforts\n to prevent disclosure by each unauthorized person who received such information.\n\n     9. Documents Produced for Inspection Prior to Designation\n\n     In the event documents are produced for inspection prior to designation, the documents shall be\n treated as For Counsel Only during inspection. At the time of copying for the receiving parties,\n Classified Information shall be marked prominently “Confidential”, “For Counsel Only”, or\n “Attorneys Eyes Only” by the producing party.\n\n     10. Consent to Disclosure and Use in Examination\n\n     Nothing in this order shall prevent disclosure beyond the terms of this order if each party\n designating the information as Classified Information consents to such disclosure or if the court, after\n notice to all affected parties and nonparties, orders such disclosure. Nor shall anything in this order\n prevent any counsel of record from utilizing Classified Information in the examination or cross-\n examination of any person who is indicated on the document as being an author, source, or recipient\n of the Classified Information, irrespective of which party produced such information.\n\n     11. Challenging the Designation\n\n      Classified Information. A party shall not be obligated to challenge the propriety of a designation of\nClassified Information at the time such designation is made, and a failure to do so shall not preclude a\nsubsequent challenge to the designation. In the event that any party to this litigation disagrees at any\nstage of these proceedings with the designation of any information as Classified Information, the parties\nshall first try to resolve the dispute in good faith on an informal basis, such as by production of redacted\ncopies. If the dispute cannot be resolved, the objecting party may invoke this Protective Order by\nobjecting in writing to the party who designated the document or information as Classified Information.\nThe designating party shall then have 14 days to move the court for an order preserving the designated\nstatus of the disputed information. The disputed information shall remain Classified Information unless\nand until the court orders otherwise.\n     Failure to move for an order shall constitute a termination of the status of such item as Classified\nInformation.\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 26\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               SR423\n\f         a. Qualified Persons. In the event that any party in good faith disagrees with the designation of\n a person as a Qualified Person or the disclosure of particular Classified Information to such person,\n the parties shall first try to resolve the dispute in good faith on an informal basis. If the dispute cannot\n be resolved, the objecting party shall have 14 days from the date of the designation or, in the event\n particular Classified Information is requested subsequent to the designation of the Qualified Person,\n 14 days from service of the request to move the court for an order denying the disposed person (a)\n status as a Qualified Person, or (b) access to particular Classified Information. The objecting person\n shall have the burden of demonstrating that disclosure to the disputed person would expose the\n objecting party to the risk of serious harm. Upon the timely filing of such a motion, no disclosure of\n Classified Information shall be made to the disputed person unless and until the court enters an order\n preserving the designation.\n\n     12. Manner of Use in Proceedings\n\n     In the event a party wishes to use any Classified Information in affidavits, declarations, briefs,\n memoranda of law, or other papers filed in this litigation, the party shall do one of the following: (1)\n with the consent of the producing party, file only a redacted copy of the information; (2) where\n appropriate (e.g., in connection with discovery and evidentiary motions) provide the information\n solely for in camera review; or (3) file such information under seal with the court consistent with the\n sealing requirements of the court.\n\n     13. Filing Under Seal\n\n     The clerk of this court is directed to maintain under seal all documents, transcripts of deposition\n testimony, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and other papers filed under seal in this litigation\n that have been designated, in whole or in part, as Classified Information by any party to this litigation\n consistent with the sealing requirements and standards of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 76a.\n\n     14. Return of Documents\n\n     Not later than 60 days after conclusion of this litigation and any appeal related to it, any Classified\n Information, all reproductions of such information, and any notes, summaries, or descriptions of such\n information in the possession of any of the persons specified in paragraph 2 (except subparagraph\n 2(a)(iii)) shall be returned to the producing party or destroyed, except as this court may otherwise\n order or to the extent such information has been used as evidence at any trial                 or hearing.\n Notwithstanding this obligation to return or destroy information, counsel may retain attorney work\n\n{1773363;}\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY AND PROTECTIVE ORDER – Page 10\n\n\n PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

Ongoing Obligations\n\n     Insofar as the provisions of this Protective Order, or any other protective orders entered in this\n litigation, restrict the communication and use of the information protected by it, such provisions shall\n continue to be binding after the conclusion of this litigation, except that (a) there shall be no restriction\n on documents that are used as exhibits in open court unless such exhibits were filed under seal, and\n (b) a party may seek the written permission of the producing party or order of the court with respect\n to dissolution or modification of this, or any other, protective order.\n\n     16. Advice to Clients\n\n     This order shall not bar any attorney in the course of rendering advice to such attorney’s client\n with respect to this litigation from conveying to any party client the attorney’s evaluation in a general\n way of Classified Information produced or exchanged under the terms of this order; provided,\n however, that in rendering such advice and otherwise communicating with the client, the attorney\n shall not disclose the specific contents of any Classified Information produced by another party if\n such disclosure would be contrary to the terms of this Protective Order.\n\n     17. Duty to Ensure Compliance\n\n     Any party designating any person as a Qualified Person shall have the duty to reasonably ensure\n that such person observes the terms of this Protective Order and shall be responsible upon breach of\n such duty for the failure of such person to observe the terms of this Protective Order.\n\n     18. Legal Effect.\n     This Protective Order shall not abrogate or diminish any contractual, statutory, or other legal\nprivilege or protection of a Party or person with respect to any information. The fact that any materials\nare designated Confidential Information pursuant to this Protective Order shall not affect or operate as\na means of objection to the admissibility of any such material. The fact that materials are designated as\nConfidential Information pursuant to this Protective Order shall not affect what a trier of fact in the\nproceedings may find to be confidential or proprietary.

Bryant, GableGotwals, 113 Pleasant Valley Drive, Suite 204, Boerne,\n        Texas 78006; Lisa T. Silvestri, GableGotwals, 100 W. Fifth Street, Suite 1100, Tulsa,\n        Oklahoma 74103; and Bill E. Davidoff, Figari & Davenport, LLP, 901 Main Street, Suite\n        3400, Dallas, Texas 75202.\n\n        Defendant Enterprise Crude Oil LLC (“Enterprise” or “Defendant”) serves its Objections\n\nand Responses to Plaintiff’s First Request for Production, served on July 21, 2017, as follows:\n\n                                    I.      INTRODUCTION\n\n        1.      These Responses and Objections are made solely for the purposes of this action.\n\nEach Response is subject to all objections as to confidence, privilege, relevance, materiality,\n\npropriety, admissibility, and any and all other objections and grounds that would require the\n\nexclusion of any statement, admission, or document, if any requests were made, or any statement\n\ncontained herein were made by a witness present and testifying in court or at a hearing, or any\n\ndocuments produced herein were proffered as evidence in court or at a hearing, all of which\n\nobjections and grounds are reserved and may be interposed at the time of trial or hearing.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                                  PAGE 1\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

Discovery, independent investigation, legal research and analysis will lead to\n\nadditional facts and evidence, and may establish entirely new factual conclusions and legal\n\ncontentions, all of which may lead to additions to, changes in and variations from the present\n\nresponses. Consequently, the following responses are given without prejudice to Enterprise’s\n\nright to produce, at time of motions or trial, such further information or facts as may hereafter\n\nbecome known and available to it.\n\n        3.     The following Responses and Objections are based upon information presently\n\navailable to Enterprise and, except for explicit facts admitted herein, no incidental or implied\n\nadmissions are intended hereby. The fact that Enterprise has responded or objected to any of the\n\nrequests, or part thereof, should not be taken as an admission that Enterprise accepts or admits\n\nthe existence of any facts set forth or assumed by such requests and/or that such response\n\nconstitutes admissible evidence. The fact that Enterprise has responded to all or part of a request\n\nis not intended and shall not be construed to be a waiver by Enterprise of all or any part of any\n\nobjection(s) to any request. Enterprise reserves the right to amend or supplement the following\n\nresponses in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure as this matter proceeds.\n\n        4.     The responses given herein exclude from their scope all documents or tangible\n\nthings (1) containing communications between counsel for Enterprise or between Enterprise and\n\nits counsel; (2) generated or prepared in anticipation of litigation by or for Enterprise or its\n\nrepresentatives; and (3) reflecting the mental impressions, strategies, and analysis of Enterprise’s\n\ncounsel, and all such materials are being withheld. If Enterprise inadvertently produces any\n\ninformation or documents protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine,\n\nor any other privilege or protection, such production is not intended to and shall not operate as a\n\nwaiver of its privileges.\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                                 PAGE 2\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 31\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       SR428\n\f        5.     Many of Magellan’s requests seek production of documents already in Magellan’s\n\npossession, custody, or control, such as communications exchanged between the parties,\n\ndocuments Enterprise has already provided to Plaintiff, or documents Magellan itself has\n\nprovided to Enterprise. Enterprise will not reproduce such documents unless Magellan is willing\n\nto bear the cost of the production.\n\n        6.     By stating that it has produced or will produce documents within its possession,\n\ncustody or control, Enterprise does not represent that any such documents exist. Rather,\n\nEnterprise is responding only that, to the extent such documents exist and are located, they have\n\nbeen or will be produced subject to and without waiver of any objection.\n\n                           II.        OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 1. Regarding the COD Agreement, the following\nDocuments created or generated on or before October 31, 2011: (a) all drafts of said agreement;\n(b) all Documents constituting or reflecting Communications between Magellan and Enterprise,\nregarding said agreement; and (c) all Documents constituting or reflecting Enterprise internal\nCommunications regarding said agreement.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects that this request seeks information that is not relevant or reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Neither Enterprise nor Magellan contend that\nthere is any ambiguity in COD Agreement. As such, its terms are to be construed by the Court\nas a matter of law. This request seeks parol evidence, that is, extrinsic evidence relating to the\nparties’ motives, intent or understanding in entering into the COD Agreement, which evidence is\ninadmissible when, as here, the terms of the parties’ agreement are unambiguous. Moreover, the\nCOD Agreement, which must be read together with the related-writings that give the effect to the\nCOD Agreement (i.e. the Connection Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement, etc.) contains a\nmerger clause. Thus, by the COD Agreement’s express terms, drafts, documents between\nMagellan and Enterprise concerning the COD Agreement and/or internal communications\nregarding the COD Agreement are not relevant.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information that is not reasonably available as requested and\nsome of which Enterprise cannot retrieve without unreasonable effort and expense. The request\nis also unduly burdensome because it fails to identify particular custodians, purporting to require\na search of the entire company. Moreover, the burden imposed by this request far outweighs the\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                                 PAGE 3\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

Taken\nliterally, the request would require the production of thousands of pages of documents that have\nlittle, if anything, to do with the claims or defenses at issue in this case.\n\nMoreover, the request is overbroad and not reasonably limited in time to the extent it seeks\ninformation at any time “before” October 31, 2011, without any limitation whatsoever.\n\nEnterprise further objects to subpart (b) of the request as unduly burdensome to the extent that\nthe documents sought are equally available to or are already in Magellan’s possession, and\ntherefore can be obtained from another source that is more convenient, less burdensome or less\nexpensive, namely, Magellan.\n\nEnterprise further objects to subpart (c) of the request because Enterprise’s internal\ncommunications discuss, concern and/or contain Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary\ninformation and trade secrets.\n\nEnterprise is withholding documents responsive to this request under the work product and/or\nattorney client privileges.

Bryant, GableGotwals, 113 Pleasant Valley Drive, Suite 204, Boerne,\n       Texas 78006; Lisa T. Silvestri, GableGotwals, 100 W. Fifth Street, Suite 1100, Tulsa,\n       Oklahoma 74103; and Bill E. Davidoff, Figari & Davenport, LLP, 901 Main Street, Suite\n       3400, Dallas, Texas 75202.\n\n       Defendant Enterprise Crude Oil LLC (“Enterprise” or “Defendant”) serves its Amended\n\nObjections and Responses to Plaintiff’s First Request for Production, served on July 21, 2017, as\n\nfollows:\n\n                                    I.      INTRODUCTION\n\n       1.      Discovery, independent investigation, legal research and analysis will lead to\n\nadditional facts and evidence, and may establish entirely new factual conclusions and legal\n\ncontentions, all of which may lead to additions to, changes in and variations from the present\n\nresponses. Consequently, the following responses are given without prejudice to Enterprise’s\n\nright to produce, at time of motions or trial, such further information or facts as may hereafter\n\nbecome known and available to it.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S AMENDED OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                               PAGE 1\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 64\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    SR461\n\f       2.      The following Responses and Objections are based upon information presently\n\navailable to Enterprise and, except for explicit facts admitted herein, no incidental or implied\n\nadmissions are intended hereby. The fact that Enterprise has responded or objected to any of the\n\nrequests, or part thereof, should not be taken as an admission that Enterprise accepts or admits\n\nthe existence of any facts set forth or assumed by such requests and/or that such response\n\nconstitutes admissible evidence. The fact that Enterprise has responded to all or part of a request\n\nis not intended and shall not be construed to be a waiver by Enterprise of all or any part of any\n\nobjection(s) to any request. Enterprise reserves the right to amend or supplement the following\n\nresponses in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure as this matter proceeds.\n\n       3.      Enterprise objects to the definition of “Enterprise” used by Magellan in its\n\nrequests, which purports to impose discovery obligations upon corporate entities other than\n\nEnterprise Crude Oil, LLC. As used in these objections and responses, “Enterprise” refers to\n\nEnterprise Crude Oil, LLC and its predecessors and successors only, and Enterprise assumes no\n\nobligation to produce documents in the care, custody and control of other entities in responding\n\nto these requests.\n\n       4.      By stating that it has produced or will produce documents within its possession,\n\ncustody or control, Enterprise does not represent that any such documents exist. Rather,\n\nEnterprise is responding only that, to the extent such documents exist and are located, they have\n\nbeen or will be produced.\n\n                            II.    OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 1. Regarding the COD Agreement, the following\nDocuments created or generated on or before October 31, 2011: (a) all drafts of said agreement;\n(b) all Documents constituting or reflecting Communications between Magellan and Enterprise,\nregarding said agreement; and (c) all Documents constituting or reflecting Enterprise internal\nCommunications regarding said agreement.\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S AMENDED OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                                PAGE 2\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT. FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER - Page 65\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      SR462\n\fRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects that this request seeks information that is not relevant or reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Neither Enterprise nor Magellan contend that\nthere is any ambiguity in COD Agreement. As such, its terms are to be construed by the Court\nas a matter of law. This request seeks parol evidence, that is, extrinsic evidence relating to the\nparties’ motives, intent or understanding in entering into the COD Agreement, which evidence is\ninadmissible when, as here, the terms of the parties’ agreement are unambiguous. Moreover, the\nCOD Agreement, which must be read together with the related-writings that give the effect to the\nCOD Agreement (i.e. the Connection Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement, etc.) contains a\nmerger clause. Thus, by the COD Agreement’s express terms, drafts, documents between\nMagellan and Enterprise concerning the COD Agreement and/or internal communications\nregarding the COD Agreement are not relevant.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information because it fails to identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company. Should the Court determine that the\nrequested information is discoverable, Enterprise will confer with Magellan regarding the proper\ncustodians and search terms for responding to this request.\n\nEnterprise further objects to subpart (c) of the request because Enterprise’s internal\ncommunications discuss, concern and/or contain Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary\ninformation and trade secrets.\n\nEnterprise is withholding documents responsive to this request under the work product and/or\nattorney client privileges. Enterprise objects to any request for the production of a privilege log\nregarding documents prepared or created after November 13, 2015.\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 2. Regarding the Joint Tariff Agreement, the following\nDocuments created or generated on or before November 1, 2011: (a) all drafts of said agreement;\n(b) all Documents constituting or reflecting Communications between Magellan and Enterprise,\nregarding said agreement; and (c) all Documents constituting or reflecting Enterprise internal\nCommunications regarding said agreement.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects that this request seeks information that is not relevant or reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Neither Enterprise nor Magellan contend that\nthere is any ambiguity in COD Agreement (or the Joint Tariff Agreement for that matter). As\nsuch, its terms are to be construed by the Court as a matter of law. This request seeks parol\nevidence, that is, extrinsic evidence relating to the parties’ motives, intent or understanding in\nentering into the Joint Tariff Agreement, which evidence is inadmissible when, as here, the terms\nof the parties’ agreement are unambiguous. Moreover, the COD Agreement, which must be read\ntogether with the related-writings that give the effect to the COD Agreement (i.e. the Connection\nAgreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement, etc.) contains a merger clause.

Should the Court determine that the\nrequested information is discoverable, Enterprise will confer with Magellan regarding the proper\ncustodians and search terms for responding to this request.\n\nEnterprise further objects to subpart (c) of the request because Enterprise’s internal\ncommunications discuss, concern and/or contain Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary\ninformation and trade secrets.\n\nEnterprise is withholding documents responsive to this request under the work product and/or\nattorney client privileges. Enterprise objects to any request for the production of a privilege log\nregarding documents prepared or created after November 13, 2015.\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 3. Regarding the Connection Agreement, the following\nDocuments created or generated on or before December 16, 2011: (a) all drafts of said\nagreement; (b) all Documents constituting or reflecting Communications between Magellan and\nEnterprise, regarding said agreement; and (c) all Documents constituting or reflecting Enterprise\ninternal Communications regarding said agreement.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects that this request seeks information that is not relevant or reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

As\nsuch, its terms are to be construed by the Court as a matter of law.

Enterprise objects to any request for the production of a privilege log\nregarding documents prepared or created after November 13, 2015.\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 4. All Documents, whether created before or after the\nCOD Agreement, identifying any business or commercial considerations which led Enterprise\nCrude Oil LLC to enter into the COD Agreement or caused or contributed to its interest in\npursuing that or any similar agreement with Magellan.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects that this request seeks information that is not relevant or reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Neither Enterprise nor Magellan contend that\nthere is any ambiguity in COD Agreement. As such, its terms are to be construed by the Court\nas a matter of law. This Request seeks parol evidence, that is, extrinsic evidence relating to the\nparties’ motives and intent in entering into the COD Agreement, which evidence inadmissible\nwhen, as here, the terms of the parties’ agreement are unambiguous.

Thus, by the COD Agreement’s express terms, drafts, documents between Magellan and\nEnterprise concerning the Connection agreement and/or internal communications regarding the\nConnection Agreement are not relevant.\n\nEnterprise further objects because the request is overbroad and not reasonably limited in subject\nto the extent it seeks information about “similar” agreements not at issue in this lawsuit, or\ngeneral factors that “led” Enterprise to enter into the Joint Tariff Agreement. Such a request,\nseeking generally “all” documents relating to the business and commercial factors that led\nEnterprise to consider doing business with Magellan (not just the agreements at issue in this\nsuit), without limitation, could encompass nearly every document and communication at\nEnterprise regarding its Gulf Coast operations. Should the Court determine that the requested\ninformation is discoverable, and subject to an appropriate protective order, Enterprise will\nproduce internal communications that discuss or set forth the business or commercial reasons for\nentering into the COD Agreement specifically, if any, but it will not produce information about\ngeneral economic conditions, oil production and markets, or other Enterprise facilities or\ncontemplated facilities that may have tangentially contributed to an interest in entering the COD\nAgreement.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information but does not identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company.

Regarding the marketing, transportation and/or\ndelivery of Eagle Ford Product to ECHO Terminal, to Genoa Junction, or to any other Houston\nArea Destination(s), all Documents containing or reporting upon any Enterprise plans, proposals,\ngoals, projections, budgets, estimates, statistics, or histories thereof. This request is not limited to\nDocuments which focus exclusively on Eagle Ford Product as defined above; any Document\ncontaining information applicable in whole or part to Eagle Ford Product, is included. For\nexample, this request includes memos, reports or analyses regarding the intended, expected or\nactual utilization of the Rancho pipeline system and/or the Rancho II pipeline system for such\npurposes.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects to the request as overbroad and unduly burdensome because it seeks “all\ndocuments” “regarding” 14 distinct categories of documents contained within this request.\nEnterprise further objects that this request is not reasonably limited in scope to matters at issue in\nthis lawsuit. Indeed, it seeks information touching upon 14 categories of documents that\ncumulatively encompass Enterprise’s entire business within the Eagle Ford Basin. Such a\nrequest, without limitation, could encompass nearly every document and communication at\nEnterprise relating to its Gulf Coast operations.\n\nEnterprise further objects to the request because the information sought discusses, concerns\nand/or contains Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information but does not identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company. Should the Court determine that the\nrequested information is discoverable, Enterprise will confer with Magellan regarding the proper\ncustodians and search terms for responding to this request.\n\nBecause this request is not reasonably limited in its scope or subject matter, it also seeks\ninformation that is not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible\nevidence. The only relevant issue in this case is whether Enterprise had good faith business\nreasons for the decisions Magellan alleges improperly reduced Enterprise’s use of the Magellan\nfacilities. These are: (1) conversion of marketing agreements to buy/sell arrangements; (2)\nbuilding the Rancho II pipeline; (3) increasing the tariff between ECHO terminal and Genoa\njunction; and (4) disconnecting Anajuac Junction. Upon entry of an appropriate protective order,\nEnterprise will produce non-privileged internal and external communications that (1) were made\nin connection with the negotiation by Enterprise Crude Oil, LLC of agreements to transport\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S AMENDED OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                                    PAGE 10\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

Enterprise objects to any request for the production of a privilege log\nregarding documents prepared or created after November 13, 2015.\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 11. All Documents which constitute, or reflect,\nCommunications between Magellan and Enterprise, regarding (i) the construction of any New\nMagellan Facilities, (ii) the In-Service Date, (iii) the use or non-use of the Magellan Facilities by\nEnterprise following the In-Service Date, (iv) the disconnection of Enterprise facilities from\nMagellan facilities at Anahuac Junction, (v) the meaning, effect, or impact of the COD\nAgreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement or the Connection Agreement, and/or (vi) any dispute\nbetween Magellan and Enterprise arising from the COD Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement\nor the Connection Agreement. For clarity, recordings and notes of any phone calls or meetings\nbetween Magellan and Enterprise, regarding any of the above matters, are included. However,\nthis request is not intended to include inter-party Communications specifically regarding any\nMagellan Audit, as those are the subject of a separate request.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects to subpart (v) of the request, which seeks communications regarding “the\nmeaning, effect, or impact of the COD Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement or the Connection\nAgreement,” because such information is irrelevant, insofar as parol evidence is not admissible\nto alter the terms or meaning of an unambiguous agreement. Upon entry of an appropriate\nprotective order, Enterprise will produce communications between Magellan and Enterprise\nregarding the identified topics.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information but does not identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company. Enterprise will confer with Magellan\nregarding the proper custodians and search terms for responding to this request.\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 12. All Documents which were authored by any Non-\nLawyer Employee(s) of Enterprise, at any time during the Relevant Period, and which analyze,\ndiscuss, comment on, question, or refer to (i) the enforceability of the COD Agreement or any of\nits provisions, (ii) the meaning or effect of the COD Agreement or any of its provisions, (iii) the\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S AMENDED OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                                 PAGE 11\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

This includes, for example, all Documents which raise any\nquestion, or discuss or mention any view or opinion of any Non-Lawyer Employee of Enterprise,\nabout whether or how the COD Agreement may affect Your purchase, sale, marketing or\ntransportation of Eagle Ford Product or any other crude oil.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects to this request because it seeks documents that are not relevant nor reasonably\ncalculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Neither Enterprise nor Magellan\ncontend that there is any ambiguity in COD Agreement. As such, its terms are to be construed\nby the Court as a matter of law. This Request seeks parol evidence, i.e., information that is not\nrelevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Moreover, the\nCOD Agreement, which must be read together with the related-writings that give the effect to the\nCOD Agreement (i.e. the Connection Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement, etc.) contains a\nmerger clause. Thus, by the COD Agreement’s express terms, information concerning the\n“meaning or effect of the COD Agreement,” the “understanding or intention of any person or\nparty with respect to the COD Agreement” and the “rights or obligations of either party with\nrespect to the COD Agreement,” are not relevant.\n\nEnterprise also objects that this request is unduly burdensome because it would require the\nproduction of electronically stored information but does not identify particular custodians,\npurporting to require a search of the entire company. Should the Court determine that the\nrequested information is discoverable, Enterprise will confer with Magellan regarding the proper\ncustodians and search terms for responding to this request.\n\nEnterprise is withholding documents responsive to this request under the work product and/or\nattorney client privileges. Enterprise objects to any request for the production of a privilege log\nregarding documents prepared or created after November 13, 2015.\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 13. All Documents which were authored by any\nLawyer Employee of Enterprise, at any time prior to February 16, 2017, and which analyze,\ndiscuss, comment on, question, or refer to (i) the enforceability of the COD Agreement or any of\nits provisions, (ii) the meaning or effect of the COD Agreement or any of its provisions, (iii) the\nunderstanding or intention of any person or party with respect to the COD Agreement or any of\nits provisions, and/or (iv) the rights or obligations of either party with respect to the COD\nAgreement or any of its provisions. This includes, for example, all Documents which raise any\nquestion, or discuss or mention any view or opinion of any Lawyer Employee of Enterprise,\nabout whether or how the COD Agreement may affect Your purchase, sale, marketing or\ntransportation of Eagle Ford Product or any other crude oil.\n\n\n\n\nDEFENDANT’S AMENDED OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S\nFIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION                                                               PAGE 12\nPLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENT TO RESPONSE TO DEF.'S MOT.

Enterprise is withholding documents responsive to\nthis request. Enterprise objects to any request for the production of a privilege log regarding\ndocuments prepared or created after November 13, 2015.\n\nEnterprise further objects to subpart (i) of the request. Neither Enterprise nor Magellan dispute\nthe validity or enforceability of the COD Agreement. Therefore, documents concerning\nenforceability of the COD Agreement are not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of admissible evidence.\n\nEnterprise objects to subparts (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the request on the ground that the information\nsought is not relevant. Neither Enterprise nor Magellan contend that there is any ambiguity in\nCOD Agreement. As such, its terms are to be construed by the Court as a matter of law. This\nRequest seeks parol evidence, i.e., information that is not relevant or reasonably calculated to\nlead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Moreover, the COD Agreement, which must be\nread together with the related-writings that give the effect to the COD Agreement (i.e. the\nConnection Agreement, the Joint Tariff Agreement, etc.) contains a merger clause. Thus, by the\nCOD Agreement’s express terms, information concerning the “meaning or effect of the COD\nAgreement,” the “understanding or intention of any person or party with respect to the COD\nAgreement” and the “rights or obligations of either party with respect to the COD Agreement”,\nare not relevant.\n\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 14. All other Documents which contain any reference\n(whether specific or general) to the COD Agreement or to any party’s rights or obligations under\nthe COD Agreement. For clarity, this request does not broadly request or require You to search\nfor each and every Document that might arguably “relate” to the COD Agreement in some way.\nRather, this request narrower: its object is to discover any Documents (not duplicative of\nDocuments produced in response to one of the preceding requests) that contain an actual\nreference (in any form) to the COD Agreement or to a party’s rights or obligations thereunder.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects because the request is global, overbroad and not reasonably limited in time or\nscope. Moreover, it is cumulative of each preceding request. It is not narrowly tailored to\ndiscover a discrete category of documents and instead, a global “catch-all” attempt to cast its net\nfar and wide in furtherance of an impermissible fishing expedition.

It seeks information regarding the\nnegotiation of all of Enterprise’s transportation agreements in the Eagle Ford Basin, and thus its\nentire business in the Eagle Ford Basin.

This request essentially\nseeks discover the entirety of Enterprise’s business concerning crude routed via ECHO Terminal\nto any Destination Point or Future Destination Point. Magellan’s only specific allegation with\nrespect to tariffs is that Enterprise increased the tariff on the bi-directional line connecting ECHO\nTerminal with Genoa Junction.

Enterprise further objects to production of “all” reports, insofar as reports may\nbe distributed internally in draft form or exist in multiple copies across personnel. Enterprise\ntherefore interprets the request to require production of a single copy of final reports only. Upon\nentry of an appropriate protective order, Enterprise will produce summary volume information\nfor shipments of Eagle Ford Product, but only to the extent (i) Enterprise is the shipper of record,\n(ii) the shipments originated at an Origin Point, and (iii) the shipment was delivered to the\nECHO Terminal, the Connection Point, or a Delivery Point.

For clarity, this request seeks Documents sufficient to give\nMagellan the same tracing capability Enterprise has with respect to deliveries of crude oil from\nECHO Terminal to any Destination Point or Future Destination Point.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nEnterprise objects to the request because the information sought discusses, concerns and/or\ncontains Enterprise’s confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets.\n\nEnterprise further objects that this request is overbroad and seeks information that is not relevant\nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, in that no Future\nDestination Point is operational and therefore none is subject to the COD Agreement. Enterprise\nfurther objects to production of “all” documents that Enterprise uses or “could use” to trace\nproduct, because use of such terms fails to identify the information sought with particularity, and\ncould include voluminous information of little probative value, such as voluminous meter\nreadings providing duplicative information.

The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion as a Matter of Law\n     When It Ordered Enterprise to Produce Its Trade Secrets,\n     and Refused to Quash Subpoenas Requiring Enterprise’s\n     Customers to Do So, Without a Showing of Necessity and\n     Without Adequate Protective Measures.\n       Beyond failing to address the overbreadth of Magellan’s requests,\n\nthe trial court further erred when it failed to address the trade-secret\n\nissues adequately. The trial court compelled Enterprise to respond to\n\nrequests that would encompass volumes of proven trade secrets, though\nMagellan made no showing that such information is necessary to the\n\ncase. In competitive markets like the crude oil market at issue, an\n\nentity's commercial information—its strategies, techniques, goals and\nplans—can be its “life blood.” Duracell Inc. v.

However, “[t]he discovery rules are not\n\nintended to forfeit a party’s ability to compete effectively in the market\nby    opening        up    tangentially         relevant       financial       and   marketing\n\ninformation to competitors.” Id. That is especially true in Texas, where\n\ncourts are supposed to apply Texas Rule of Evidence 507.\n       Under Rule 507, Enterprise is entitled to withhold—and to\n\nprevent its customers from disclosing—its trade secrets to Magellan, an\n\navowed competitor.

Exhibit 5 to\n\nMagellan’s first supplement is attached hereto, in redacted form, and marked as Exhibit A hereto.\n\n             During the December 28, 2017 hearing, Magellan provided Exhibit 5 to the Court and to\n\nEnterprise, in unredacted form. At that time, Magellan’s counsel inquired whether and to what\n\nextent Enterprise deems the content of Exhibit 5 confidential information, but the Enterprise\n\nattorney presenting Enterprise’s Motion for Entry of a Protective Order, Mr. Bennett, stated that\n\nhe was unable to answer and referred Magellan to another Enterprise attorney, Ms. Stahl.\n\nImmediately following the hearing, Magellan provided Exhibit 5 to Ms. Stahl, noting that one of\n\nthe emails included in Exhibit 5 was recently produced by Enterprise without any legend or other\n\nindication that Enterprise deems it confidential, and that the content of the remaining inter-party\n\nemails included in Exhibit 5 is substantially similar to the email Enterprise produced without any\n\nindication of confidentiality. In her written response, Ms. Stahl stated that Enterprise’s production\n\nof the above-referenced email without any indication of confidentiality was inadvertent; and that\nPLAINTIFF’S SECOND SUPP.

Then,\n\nin a subsequent email to Magellan’s counsel, Ms. Stahl provided an Enterprise-redacted version\n\nof Exhibit 5 in a form said to be “acceptable for filing.” Exhibit C, attached.\n\n             Magellan does not agree that the information contained in the inter-party emails included\n\nin Exhibit 5 constitutes “confidential information” as defined in the audit-related Confidentiality\n\nAgreement. Nor does Magellan agree with Enterprise’s assertions that the audit-related\n\nConfidentiality Agreement precludes Magellan from using or disclosing in this action, for purposes\n\nof pursuing the claims Magellan discovered through its pre-suit audits and alleges in its Original\n\nPetition, any information falling within the Confidentiality Agreement’s definition of “confidential\n\ninformation.” However, to avoid other needless disputes with and threats from Enterprise, and\n\nreserving all rights, Magellan has redacted Exhibit 5 to eliminate any and all arguably “confidential\n\ninformation” including all references to a specific customer, to specific terms of any known\n\nagreement between Enterprise and a customer, to specific product volumes, or to specific contents\n\nof any product transaction data found in spreadsheets Enterprise provided in a pre-suit audit.\n\n             Magellan’s redacted version of Exhibit 5 eliminates much of, but not all of, the same\n\ninformation Enterprise suggested be redacted as “confidential.” Magellan has rejected some of\n\nEnterprise’s redactions because they are unprincipled, inconsistent, and overly broad, including\n\ninformation that cannot conceivably be confidential, such as information of a kind that Enterprise\n\nitself has publicly disclosed and used in this action.\n\n             Dated January 2, 2018.\n\n\nPLAINTIFF’S SECOND SUPP.

The information contained within these documents is\nconfidential information under the Confidentiality Agreement governing the audit, and will be designated as\nConfidential for purposes of this lawsuit as well. Most have already been withheld on this basis. Each of the documents\nin proposed Exhibit 5 were provided to Magellan in connection with the audit and are non-public materials containing\ncustomer lists, operational information, and business and financial information subject to the protections of the\nAgreement. As such, they must be held in strict confidence and not disclosed to anyone other than representatives of\nMagellan with a legitimate need to review them. Filing the documents of public record violates the terms of the\nConfidentiality Agreement, which Enterprise will not hesitate to enforce by way of injunction or other appropriate relief.\n\nMoreover, under paragraph 5 of the Confidentiality Agreement, Magellan and its Representatives are required to\n“reasonably cooperate with [Enterprise] to assure that, to the extent possible, confidential treatment will be accorded\nto any such Confidential Information or Notes disclosed.” Giving us less than 24 hours’ notice of Magellan’s intent to\nmake Confidential Information public—right before a holiday weekend and without affording us any opportunity to seek\nappropriate relief under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 76a—is not “reasonable cooperation” and would risk only further\nbreach of the Confidentiality Agreement.\n\nAs indicated at the hearing, Enterprise does not object to the Court reviewing the materials in camera in connection with\nthe pending Motion for Entry of Protective Order. By providing the material only for review, the document is not a\n“court record” for purposes of Rule 76a. See General Tire, Inc. v. Kepple, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1491826\"><a href=\"/opinion/1491826/general-tire-inc-v-kepple/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525 (Tex. 1998).\n\nWith respect to ECO000650-652, the reviewer inadvertently failed to designate this correspondence – which contains\ncustomer information and volume data – as Confidential. The request from Ms. Flock that includes images of portions of\nthe spreadsheet provided in the audit (and which has consistently been withheld from production on confidentiality\ngrounds) appears in several emails, which Enterprise will designate as Confidential upon entry of a Protective Order.\nThese are ECO 000561-563, ECO 000564-566, ECO 000567-570, ECO 000574-576, ECO 000579-581, ECO 000583-585,\n000586-589, ECO 590-593, ECO 000594-597, ECO 000598-601, ECO 000610-613, ECO 614-618, ECO 000633-637, ECO\n000638-642, ECO 000650-652, ECO 000653-656, and ECO 000657-659.\n\nPending entry of that order, the materials continue to be protected by the parties’ Confidentiality Agreement, and\nEnterprise does not consent to filing of these materials publicly.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n                              Linda R.

Enterprise - Exhibit 5 to Plaintiff's Supplement to Response to Defendant’s Motion for\nEntry of Protective Order\n\nLinda,\n\nWhen we filed Magellan’s Supplement to Response to Defendant’s Motion for Entry of Protective Order, late yesterday,\nwe omitted Exhibit 5 pending a determination whether Enterprise believes there’s a need for that Exhibit to be filed\nunder seal. Though I was not present for the hearing this morning, I understand that Mr. Bennett was unable to answer\nthat but indicated you can. So I’m attaching Exhibit 5 and requesting your prompt advice whether Enterprise thinks it\nneeds to be filed under seal. The Exhibit includes 4 email chains, each ending in an email from Ms. Truitt to Ms. Flock. As\nindicated below, the chain ending in Ms. Truitt’s 3/29/16 email was produced by Enterprise but not marked confidential.\nIf you’ve produced the others, please advise, because we couldn’t find them in your production.
