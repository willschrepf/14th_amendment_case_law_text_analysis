SCOTT, Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\n                                  v.\n\n   George E. MOORE, individually and as an employee of Killeen\nPolice Department, et al., Defendants-Appellees.\n\n                           June 17, 1996.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Texas.\n\nBefore POLITZ, Chief Judge, and WISDOM and SMITH, Circuit Judges.\n\n     WISDOM, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Plaintiff/appellant, Artelia M. Scott, appeals the summary\n\njudgment dismissal of her 42 U.S.C. § 1983 inadequate staffing\n\nclaim against the City of Killeen, Texas (\"the City\"), and its\n\nChief of Police, Francis L. Giacomozzi.     Because we conclude that\n\na material fact issue remains in dispute, we VACATE and REMAND to\n\nthe district court for further proceedings.\n\n                      I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n     The   plaintiff/appellant,   Artelia   Scott,   was    arrested   on\n\nDecember 31, 1988, for public intoxication, assault, and resisting\n\narrest.    She was taken to the Killeen City Jail, processed by the\n\nfemale jailer on duty at that time, and placed in a holding cell to\n\nawait arraignment.   When the female jailer's shift ended, she was\n\nrelieved by a male jailer, defendant George Moore.         At that time,\n\nMoore was the only correctional officer on duty.      Over the course\n\nof his eight hour shift, Moore repeatedly entered Scott's cell and\n\n\n                                  1\n\fsexually assaulted her.     Scott was unable to report the incidents\n\nuntil she was released from custody on January 2, 1989, because\n\nMoore followed her to the phone and stood next to her during her\n\nthree telephone calls to her mother.\n\n     When    Chief   Giacomozzi    received   Scott's   complaint   against\n\nMoore, he asked Scott to give a statement to the police and take a\n\nlie detector test.       Scott agreed to do so.         After the results\n\nindicated that Scott was telling the truth, Giacomozzi transferred\n\nthe matter to the criminal investigation division, and placed Moore\n\non administrative leave.          Moore resigned four days later, and\n\nsubsequently pleaded guilty to criminal charges.\n\n     Scott filed suit in state court against Moore, the City, and\n\nChief Giacomozzi, alleging various state and federal constitutional\n\nclaims.     Moore subsequently declared bankruptcy and was dismissed\n\nfrom the suit after the bankruptcy proceeding discharged Scott's\n\nclaim against him.      The City and Giacomozzi removed the case to\n\nfederal court, where they filed their first motion for summary\n\njudgment.     Scott did not file a response, and the district court\n\ngranted the motion.      On appeal, this court affirmed the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment on all grounds except inadequate\n\nstaffing of the jail, as both the defendants' motion and the\n\ndistrict court's ruling failed to address this aspect of Scott's\n\nsuit.1\n\n     After remand, the City and Giacomozzi filed a second motion\n\n\n     1\n      Scott v. Moore, 987 F.2d 771, No. 92-8284 (5th Cir., March\n3, 1993) (unpublished) (per curiam ).\n\n                                      2\n\ffor summary judgment on the issue of inadequate staffing.                    The\n\ndistrict court granted the motion.          Scott filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal of this decision.\n\n                                 II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n           We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the\n\nsame       standards    as   those   that   govern   the   district   court's\n\ndetermination.2         Summary judgment may be granted only if the court,\n\nviewing the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving party, determines that there is no genuine issue as to\n\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\nas   a matter      of    law.3   The   moving   party   must   demonstrate   by\n\ncompetent evidence that no issue of material fact exists.4                   The\n\nnon-moving party then has the burden of showing the existence of a\n\nspecific factual issue which is disputed.5              If any element of the\n\nplaintiff's case lacks factual support, a district court should\n\ngrant a defendant's motion for summary judgment.6\n\nB. Scott's § 1983 Claim:\n\n       We first examine the allegations in Scott's complaint to\n\n       2\n      Waltman v. International Paper Co., 875 F.2d 468, 474 (5th\nCir.1989).\n       3\n        Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\n       4\n      Isquith v.

Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 321-23, 106 S.Ct.\n2548, 2552-53, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\n       6\n        Id.\n\n                                        3\n\fdetermine a context for examining the facts and inferences in the\n\nrecord.7 Specifically, Scott alleges that \"the City and Giacomozzi\n\nfailed to provide proper and adequate staffing of the City jail by\n\nhaving only one individual on duty, and/or by not having a female\n\nmember present when female prisoners are confined.\"              She further\n\nalleges that the defendants/appellees \"knew or should have known\n\nthat the inadequate and improper staffing created an unsafe and\n\nuncontrolled situation for abuse and assaults of people confined in\n\nthe jail.\"\n\n         Section 1983 provides that, \"[e]very person who, under color\n\nof any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any\n\nState ... subjects or causes to be subjected, any ... person within\n\nthe jurisdiction [of the United States] to the deprivation of any\n\nrights ... secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to\n\nthe party injured.\"8      Therefore, an actionable § 1983 claim must\n\nallege a deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution by a\n\nperson acting under color of state law.9\n\n         Although municipalities are \"persons\" within the meaning of\n\n§ 1983, they may only be held liable if the constitutional harm\n\nsuffered    was   the   result   of   an   \"official   policy,   custom,   or\n\n\n\n     7\n      Collins v.

First, we must decide\n\nif the City promulgated \"an official policy, practice, or custom,\"\n\nwhich could subject it to § 1983 liability.16                                      Next, we determine\n\nif the policy can be linked to a constitutional violation.17                                          And\n\nfinally,            we    must   ascertain          if       the   municipality's           action   (or\n\ninaction)            extended        beyond         mere      negligent           oversight     of    the\n\nplaintiff's constitutional rights.18\n\n1. The Existence of an \"Official Policy\"\n\n         This court has defined an \"official policy\" for the purposes\n\nof   §        1983       liability        to   be   either:              1)   a    policy    statement,\n\nordinance, regulation, or decision that is officially adopted and\n\npromulgated by the municipality's law-making officers or by an\n\nofficial            to    whom      the    lawmakers          have       delegated       policy-making\n\nauthority;                or   2)    a     persistent         widespread           practice     of   city\n\nofficials            or     employees,         which,         although            not   authorized      by\n\nofficially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common and well\n\nsettled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal\n\npolicy.19           We find that the facts of this case present an \"official\n\n         15\n              Id.\n         16\n              Monell, 436 U.S. at 690-94, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-37.\n         17\n              Id.\n         18\n      Hare, 74 F.3d at 643, Colle, 981 F.2d at 246;                                         Rhyne 973\nF.2d at 392.\n         19\n      Webster v. City of Houston, 735 F.2d 838, 841 (5th\nCir.1984).\n\n                                                         6\n\fpolicy\" under the second of these definitions.\n\n          The City's Code of Ordinances vests Chief Giacomozzi, as\n\nChief of Police, with administrative and policy-making authority.\n\nTherefore, Giacomozzi's acts or omissions as policy-maker for the\n\njail may subject both him and the city to § 1983 liability.20                 While\n\nacting     under    his   policy   making      authority,    Giacomozzi   issued\n\n\"General Order MSC-1-78,\" (\"the General Order\") consisting of rules\n\nrelating to the management and administration of the City jail.\n\nThese rules mandate in relevant part that male personnel dealing\n\nwith female prisoners should search the female prisoner's coats or\n\nouter garments, but may not frisk them or conduct a pat-down search\n\nunless there is a strong probability of finding a weapon.                       In\n\naddition, female prisoners booked into the jail must be \"thoroughly\n\nand completely searched\" by female personnel with the jailer\n\nremaining       nearby,   then   placed   in    a   cell   separated   from   male\n\nprisoners.       And finally, the regulations provide that \"[a]nytime a\n\nprisoner is released from his or her cell for any reason other than\n\nrelease from custody, the prisoner shall be searched upon release\n\nfrom and return to the cell.\"         The General Order does not regulate\n\nthe number of jailers needed to staff the jail.21\n\n     Appellant Scott conceded at oral argument that this policy is\n\n\n     20\n          Id.\n     21\n      The General Order contains only three references to\nstaffing: 1) \"[t]he Jailer shall be the booking officer when on\nduty;\" 2) \"[i]n the absence of an on-duty Jailer, the assigned\ndesk officer shall assume the overall duties and responsibilities\nof the jailer;\" and 3) \"the arresting officer shall book his or\nher own prisoner if the desk officer is not available\".\n\n                                          7\n\fconstitutional as written.          Therefore, the General Order is not an\n\nactionable \"official policy\" under the first definition of that\n\nterm.22       Scott contends, however, that there is an \"unofficial\"\n\nstaffing policy which is actionable under the second definition of\n\n\"official policy.\"         We agree.\n\n        Since the late 1970's the City jail has been staffed by four\n\njailers, with one jailer working each of four shifts:            a.m., p.m.,\n\nday, and relief.          At the time of Scott's detention, two male and\n\ntwo female employees filled these positions.                  Thus, a female\n\ndetainee would necessarily be guarded by a single male jailer at\n\nsome    time     during    a   twenty-four   hour   period.    This    staffing\n\narrangement made it difficult, if not impossible, for the City\n\njailers to follow the mandates of the General Order.23                Yet, this\n\nconflict between the written General Order and the day-to-day\n\nstaffing procedures existed for at least ten years before Scott's\n\ndetention.        In this situation, we conclude that the consistent\n\ncustom or \"unofficial policy\" of having only one unsupervised male\n\njailer present when a female detainee is in the jail constitutes an\n\n\"official policy\" for the purposes of § 1983 liability.24\n\n       22\n            Webster, 735 F.2d at 841.\n       23\n      For example, if a female prisoner has to leave her cell\nwhile a single male jailer is on duty, the jailer will have to\nviolate either the rule that the prisoner be searched both upon\nexiting and reentering her cell, or the rule that all searches of\nfemale prisoners be done by a female employee. In this case,\nScott left her cell a least three times to use the telephone.\n       24\n      See Monell, 436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036, (a\n\"permanent and well settled\" custom may provide basis for\nimposing liability on a municipality) (quoting Adickes v. S.H.\nKress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 168, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1614, 26 L.Ed.2d\n\n                                        8\n\f2. Existence of a Constitutional Violation:\n\n          The next step in our § 1983 analysis is to determine if\n\nScott's complaint alleges a constitutional deprivation.25                   The\n\nsexual assault on Scott while she was a pre-trial detainee is not\n\ncovered     by   the   Eighth   Amendment,    as   the    Eighth    Amendment's\n\nprohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishment\" applies only to\n\nconvicted prisoners and not to pretrial detainees like Scott.26              It\n\nis clear however, that pretrial detainees are Constitutionally\n\nentitled to at least as great a protection in their detention as\n\nare convicted prisoners.27       This right arises from the substantive\n\nprotections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nwhich     protects     an   individual's     liberty     interest   in   bodily\n\nintegrity.28     Although the Supreme Court has expressed a general\n\nreluctance to expand the concept of substantive due process in §\n\n1983 claims,29 it has concluded that the government owes a duty to\n\ncare for those whom have already been deprived of their liberty\n\n\n142 (1970)); Webster, 735 F.2d at 841, (defining \"official\npolicy\" as including a \"persistent widespread practice of city\nofficials and employees, which although not authorized by\nofficially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common and well\nsettled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents\nmunicipal policy\").\n     25\n          Collins, 503 U.S. at 120, 112 S.Ct. at 1066.\n     26\n      Ingraham v.

The     City   therefore    had     a    constitutional\n\nobligation under the Fourteenth Amendment to provide Scott with\n\nminimal levels of safety and security. Scott's claim of inadequate\n\nstaffing challenges the adequacy of the levels of safety and\n\nsecurity     given     to   pretrial       detainees    in     the    City's   jail.\n\nTherefore,     Scott's      claim     properly    alleges       a    constitutional\n\nviolation.\n\n3. Did the City's Actions Extend beyond Negligent Oversight of\n     Scott's Rights?\n\n     Finally,     we    address     whether     the   City's    and    Giacomozzi's\n\nfailure to adequately staff the jail or to adopt a written policy\n\non adequate staffing for the jail extends beyond mere negligent\n\noversight of Scott's constitutional rights.                   Resolution of this\n\nissue requires us to examine this court's recent en banc decision\n\nin Hare v. City of Corinth, MS.32\n\n     In Hare, this court attempted to clarify the divergent case\n\n\n     30\n          Id. at 126-27, 112 S.Ct. at 1069-70.\n     31\n          Id. at 127, 112 S.Ct. at 1070.\n     32\n          74 F.3d 633 (5th Cir.1996).\n\n                                           10\n\flaw on the different standards used to measure pre-trial detainees'\n\nconstitutional rights to medical care and protection from harm.\n\nThe en banc court concluded there should be no distinction between\n\ncases involving the right to medical care and those involving the\n\nright     to    be    protected    from     harm.33      The   court   did    find   a\n\ndistinction, however, between cases involving episodic acts and\n\nomissions        by    jail    officials,        and   cases   involving     general\n\nconditions, practices and restrictions of confinement.34                     In cases\n\ninvolving episodic acts or omissions by jail officials, the court\n\nheld that liability attaches only if the officers involved were\n\nsubjectively          and   \"deliberately    indifferent\"      to   the   prisoner's\n\nrights.35       This high level of scrutiny insures that municipalities\n\nwill not be held liable for mere negligence, but will instead must\n\nonly answer for intentional violations of prisoners rights.36\n\n          In contrast, in cases involving the general conditions of\n\nconfinement, there is an automatic assumption that the practice in\n\nquestion was intentional.37           Therefore, in such cases, the proper\n\nstandard is whether the practice in question was \"reasonably\n\nrelated to a legitimate governmental purpose\".38                When this test is\n\n     33\n          Id. at 643.\n     34\n          Id.\n     35\n      Id. at 643, adopting the standard set forth in Farmer v.\nBrennan, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).\n     36\n          Id.\n     37\n          Id. at 645.\n     38\n      Id. at 640, adopting the standard set forth in Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\n\n                                            11\n\fproperly applied, it is the functional equivalent of the subjective\n\n\"deliberate indifference\" standard applied to the episodic acts of\n\nprison officials.39\n\n     In the present case, the staffing procedures in question\n\nqualify as a general condition of confinement.     We therefore need\n\nnot inquire into Chief Giacomozzi's subjective intent in allowing\n\na single male jailer to guard female prisoners in such a manner\n\nthat he would by necessity have to violate the existing General\n\nOrder.      We need only inquire whether the practice was reasonably\n\nrelated to a legitimate government goal.40\n\n      It is our conclusion that a reasonable factual dispute exists\n\non this point, thereby precluding summary judgment. The defendants\n\nhave offered only financial considerations as an explanation for\n\nthe staffing policy at the Killeen City Jail.     Although financial\n\nconsiderations may reasonably concern a municipality, such concerns\n\nmay not trump the constitutional rights of individuals who are left\n\nat the mercy of the municipality.41     Furthermore, the record does\n\nnot reflect how often the City detains female prisoners, or how\n\ndifficult it would be to provide for an additional female staff\n\n\n\n\n     39\n          Id. at 643.\n     40\n          Id.\n     41\n      See, DeShaney v. Winnebago Co. Dep't of Social Services,\n489 U.S. 189, 198, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1005, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989)\n(recognizing that \"when the state takes a person into its custody\nand holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes\nupon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for\nhis safety and general well-being\").\n\n                                  12\n\fmember during those times.42\n\n       In addition, the unofficial staffing policy at the Killeen\n\nCity jail does not appear to serve a reasonable safety goal, and\n\nactually contradicts the official safety measures set forth in the\n\nGeneral Order.       Because the General Order reflects common concerns\n\nabout the safety and privacy of female inmates, the decision to\n\ncontradict the mandates of the General Order can actually be\n\ninterpreted as a sign of deliberate disregard of the constitutional\n\nrights of female prisoners.\n\n       It is our opinion that a reasonable jury could find that the\n\nunofficial staffing policy at the Killeen City Jail resulted in a\n\nviolation of Scott's constitutional rights, and that the City's\n\nactions in allowing such inadequate staffing went beyond negligent\n\noversight of prisoners' Constitutional rights.                      Therefore, we\n\nVACATE the district court's grant of summary judgment on Scott's §\n\n1983    claim   of     inadequate      staffing,     and   REMAND    for   further\n\nproceedings.\n\n       JERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       In what amounts to social engineering by judicial fiat, the\n\npanel majority has decided that as a matter of constitutional\n\nimperative, the city must maintain a minimum of two male guards, or\n\nat least one female guard, in its jail whenever a female detainee\n\nis   present.        Because   there    is    no   showing—even     remotely—of   a\n\n       42\n      In fact, the deposition testimony of Chief Giacomozzi\nindicates that the officer in charge of the jail had the\ndiscretion to call extra officers from the Killeen City Police\nDepartment to the jail in times of need. Yet, inexplicably, this\nprocedure has never been used.\n\n                                         13\n\fconstitutional violation by the city, and because the summary\n\njudgment    evidence   does   not   support    a   finding   of   deliberate\n\nindifference, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                     I.\n\n     My first disagreement is over the standard we use to determine\n\nmunicipal liability.     Both sides treat this as a controversy over\n\ninadequate staffing and analyze the city's conduct under the\n\ndeliberate   indifference     standard.       Erroneously,    however,   the\n\nmajority applies the reasonable relationship standard of Bell v.\n\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\n\n                                     A.\n\n     Deliberate indifference is the proper standard for assessing\n\nmunicipal liability when the custom at issue is one of inadequate\n\nstaffing.    See Colle v. Brazos County, 981 F.2d 237, 245-46 (5th\n\nCir.1993);    Rhyne v. Henderson County, 973 F.2d 386, 393-94 (5th\n\nCir.1992).   The custom challenged in this case is one of providing\n\nstaffing that is inadequate to protect female detainees from sexual\n\nassaults.    The plaintiff's challenge to this custom is that the\n\ncity's failure to adopt a different policy—i.e., to require the\n\npresence of additional guards—caused her injury.              \"The Supreme\n\nCourt has held that municipal failure to adopt a policy does not\n\nconstitute such an intentional choice unless it can be said to have\n\nbeen \"deliberately indifferent.' \"        Id. at 392.\n\n     Treating this case as one about conditions of confinement is\n\na misapplication of Hare v. City of Corinth, 74 F.3d 633 (5th\n\nCir.1996) (en banc).    The majority concludes, without explanation,\n\n\n                                     14\n\fthat the city's custom of allowing a single male to guard a female\n\ndetainee is a condition of confinement.           At a high level of\n\ngenerality, this could be so, in the sense that one of the\n\nconditions in the jail is a lack of extra guards.         But, at that\n\nlevel of generality, the omission that led to the suicide in Hare\n\nalso could be called a \"condition of confinement\":      A condition in\n\nthe jail was the lack of a guard to watch over the suicidal\n\ndetainee.\n\n      The problem with the majority's approach is that it ignores\n\nboth the common-sense understanding of \"conditions of confinement\"\n\nand the reasons articulated in Hare for distinguishing those\n\nconditions from episodic acts or omissions.        In Hare, this court\n\ncarefully distinguished episodic acts or omissions from conditions\n\nof confinement.     We did so because a pretrial detainee has a due\n\nprocess right to be free from punishment, and a hardship amounts to\n\npunishment when there is an intent to punish.         See Wolfish, 441\n\nU.S. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1873 (\"A court must decide whether the\n\ndisability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it\n\nis but an incident of some other legitimate governmental purpose.\")\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      When asking whether a jailer intended to punish a detainee,\n\nthe   reasonable   relationship   test   works   comfortably   in   \"jail\n\ncondition cases,\" because intent can be presumed in the form of the\n\nchallenged condition, practice, rule, or restriction.          Hare, 74\n\nF.3d at 644.       Thus, when the hardship of which the detainee\n\ncomplains is the very act of imposing a condition, practice, rule,\n\n\n                                  15\n\for restriction, the only question is whether there is a reasonable\n\nrelationship to a legitimate state interest.         In the case of\n\nepisodic acts or omissions, on the other hand, the reasonable\n\nrelationship test is more difficult to apply, as intent cannot be\n\npresumed.1\n\n     The lesson of Hare is that a condition of confinement is a\n\ncondition, practice, rule, or restriction that itself is the wrong\n\nof which the detainee complains.      The common-sense interpretation\n\nof a \"condition of confinement\" includes the number of bunks in a\n\ncell, the number of showers and meals per day, and even a policy of\n\ndaily beatings.2   The intent to impose the hardship can be presumed\n\n\n     1\n      Hare, 74 F.3d at 645 (\"Asking about the rationality of the\nrelationship between an official's episodic acts or omissions and\na legitimate governmental objective begs the underlying question\nwhether that official had the requisite mental state to establish\nhis liability as a perpetrator of the particular act or omission,\nnot as a dispenser of intended conditions or restrictions.\").\n     2\n      See, e.g. Murphy v. Walker, 51 F.3d 714 (7th Cir.1995)\n(treating shackling and revocation of telephone, television, and\ncigarette privileges as a condition of confinement); Collanzo-\nLeon v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 51 F.3d 315 (1st Cir.1995)\n(treating disciplinary segregation and denial of telephone and\nvisitation privileges as a condition of confinement); United\nStates v. Millan, 4 F.3d 1038 (2d Cir.1993) (treating length of\npre-trial detention as a condition of confinement), cert. denied,\n--- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1375, 128 L.Ed.2d 51, and cert. denied,\n--- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1386, 128 L.Ed.2d 60 (1994); Hause v.\nVaught, 993 F.2d 1079 (4th Cir.1993) (treating restriction on\nmail privileges as a condition of confinement), cert. denied, ---\nU.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 702, 126 L.Ed.2d 668 (1994); Brogsdale v.\nBarry, 926 F.2d 1184 (D.C.Cir.1991) (treating overcrowding as a\ncondition of confinement); Lyons v. Powell, 838 F.2d 28 (1st\nCir.1988) (treating 22-23 hour confinement and placement of\nmattress on the floor as a condition of confinement); Fredericks\nv. Huggins, 711 F.2d 31 (4th Cir.1983) (treating policy of\nrefusing detainees access to drugs for rehabilitation as a\ncondition of confinement); Lareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d 96 (2d\nCir.1981) (treating overcrowding as a condition of confinement).\n\n                                 16\n\ffrom the existence of the policy.\n\n     Here, the wrong of which the plaintiff complains is the sexual\n\nassaults;     the policy she attacks is the lack of additional\n\nstaffing.    One cannot infer an intent to cause the wrong merely\n\nfrom the existence of the challenged policy.         Certainly, if the\n\ncity's policy were the complained-of disability (such as in a\n\ndouble-bunking   case),   the   standard   for   municipal   and   jailer\n\nliability theoretically could merge.3 In this case, it should not.4\n\n     3\n      I pause to point out that Hare dealt with the question of\nwhen a detainee's constitutional rights have been violated. As\nthe court pointed out, determining the existence of a\nconstitutional violation is only the first step in determining\nmunicipal liability for that violation. Hare, 74 F.3d at 649 n.\n4.\n\n          In the case of an omission or episodic act, the\n     existence of a constitutional violation would be determined\n     by the subjective deliberate indifference standard.\n     Municipal liability for that violation would be determined\n     under the objective deliberate indifference standard.\n\n            We separate the two issues: the existence of a\n            constitutional violation simpliciter and a\n            municipality's liability for that violation. Different\n            versions of the deliberate indifference test govern the\n            two inquiries. Our opinion in this case makes clear\n            that to prove an underlying constitutional violation in\n            an individual or episodic acts case, a pre-trial\n            detainee must establish that an official acted with\n            subjective deliberate indifference. Once the detainee\n            has met this burden, she has proved a violation of her\n            rights under the Due Process Clause. To succeed in\n            holding a municipality accountable for that due process\n            violation, however, the detainee must show that the\n            municipal employee's act resulted from a municipal\n            policy or custom adopted or maintained with objective\n            deliberate indifference to the detainee's\n            constitutional rights.\n\n     Id.\n\n          If a non-policymaker imposed a condition of confinement\n     on a detainee, see, e.g., Bryer v. Creati, 915 F.2d 1556\n\n                                   17\n\f                               B.\n\n     A failure to adopt a policy can be deliberately indifferent\n\nwhen it is obvious that the likely consequence of not adopting a\n\npolicy will be a deprivation of constitutional rights.   City of\n\nCanton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1205, 103\n\n\n     (1st Cir.1990) (unpublished) (applying\n     condition-of-confinement analysis where a police officer\n     left open a window during freezing weather), the reasonable\n     relationship test would be used to determine whether the\n     detainee's constitutional rights had been violated. To\n     determine municipal liability for the violation, the\n     objective deliberate indifference test would be used,\n     because a policymaker did not promulgate a policy of\n     imposing that condition of confinement.\n\n          The majority has assumed that when a policymaker\n     creates the condition of confinement, the standards for\n     determining the underlying constitutional violation and\n     municipal liability are the same. Because I disagree with\n     the majority that this is a case about conditions of\n     confinement, I do not address that contention. See\n     generally Roman v. Jeffes, 904 F.2d 192, 197-98 (3d\n     Cir.1990) (applying the reasonable relationship test to\n     determine whether a policy of limiting a detainee to one bag\n     of possessions during a transfer violated his constitutional\n     rights, but applying the objective deliberate indifference\n     standard to determine whether the municipality was liable\n     for promulgating the rule).\n     4\n      Even if the district court relied on an incorrect legal\nstandard, the plaintiff has waived any challenge to that error.\nThe district court granted summary judgment under the deliberate\nindifference standard, and plaintiff has not challenged the use\nof that standard. Instead, she has consistently argued that\nthere is a material fact issue on the question of deliberate\nindifference.\n\n          The majority's reliance on Hare is misplaced. The\n     reasonable relationship test predated Hare. If the\n     plaintiff believed that the district court applied the wrong\n     standard, she should have raised that argument on appeal.\n     That the en banc court limited the applicability of the\n     reasonable relationship test hardly justifies an exception\n     to the waiver rule. The plaintiff was on notice that the\n     reasonable relationship test existed, and she has not argued\n     that it should apply to this case.\n\n                               18\n\fL.Ed.2d 412 (1989).    The plaintiff relies on the affidavit of\n\nCharles Craig, an expert on jail policy, who averred that his\n\nexperience showed him that a prison should have female officers to\n\nprevent sexual assaults, or that male officers should be supervised\n\nwhen allowed access to female inmates. He concluded that a failure\n\nto have two guards or a female guard could not be justified.\n\n     The record also establishes that the city has followed the\n\nsame staffing procedures since the late 1970's, yet no incident\n\nsuch as this has transpired.5      Jailers were subjected to a number\n\nof background checks, including a polygraph test,6 and the city\n\nlimited contact   between   male   and   female   jailers   in   order   to\n\nminimize the possibility of sexual misconduct.7             The jail is\n\n     5\n      There is no evidence that Chief Giacomozzi has ever had any\ncomplaints of sexual assault by a jailer or any related type of\ncomplaint prior to the incident at issue here.\n     6\n      The City subjected Moore, the perpetrator of this incident,\nto a background investigation, medical examination and polygraph\ntest as a condition of his employment. In addition, Moore had\nbeen previously employed as a commissioned police officer,\nwithout incident, for four years prior to his employment with the\njail. He was trained in the official policies of jail management\nby experienced jailers.\n     7\n      General Order MSC-1-78 (\"the General Order\"), which\nregulates the management of the city jail, prohibits male\npersonnel from frisking or conducting a pat-down search of a\nfemale prisoner. It also requires that a female be searched by\nfemale personnel. Moreover, anytime a prisoner is released from\nher cell for any reason, the General Order requires that she be\nsearched upon release from and return to the cell. Finally, the\npolicy allows for additional staffing by commissioned officers of\nthe police department when the holding facility's population is\nlarge or if a difficult prisoner is in custody.\n\n          The majority claims that the staffing policy made it\n     inevitable that the General Order would be disregarded. I\n     find nothing in the record to support such a conclusion or\n     inference. The majority bases its conclusion on the fact\n\n                                   19\n\flocated on the first floor of the police department, in the patrol\n\ndivision area, and a patrol duty sergeant would periodically check\n\non jail personnel. More than one hundred uniformed police officers\n\nin the building had unlimited access to the jail at all times.\n\n       There is no jury question as to whether the failure to have\n\nadditional staffing amounts to deliberate indifference.           The city\n\ntook   numerous   precautions   to    safeguard   the   safety   of   female\n\ndetainees, including the requirements of the General Order and the\n\nextensive background checks of the jailers. See Rhyne, 973 F.2d at\n\n393 (finding that the existence of a policy—albeit an inadequate\n\none—demonstrated that the municipality was not indifferent, in the\n\nliteral sense of the word).          A patrol sergeant was assigned to\n\nmonitor the jail and would periodically stop by to check on jail\n\npersonnel.\n\n       In summary, Craig's testimony does not establish that the city\n\npolicymakers faced an obvious risk and were consciously indifferent\n\nto it.    At most, the evidence could be construed to show that the\n\njail might have been better managed, or even that Giacomozzi was\n\nnot prescient in failing to consider the risk that well-trained\n\njailers would, without warning, assault a female detainee.\n\n                                     II.\n\n       Even assuming that the \"reasonable relationship\" test should\n\napply to this case, there is no jury question as to whether the\n\n\n       that the four jailers could not possibly follow the General\n       Order. What the majority fails to consider is that the jail\n       is located where the jailers could easily call for a\n       uniformed officer to assist them when a female detainee is\n       booked and searched.\n\n                                     20\n\fcity's custom was reasonably related to a legitimate government\n\ninterest.   I find the majority's conclusions surprising;      the\n\nopinion can be supported only by misunderstanding the summary\n\njudgment evidence and by failing to apply the deference that\n\nWolfish demands.\n\n     The reasonable relationship test is a highly deferential test\n\nthat, as the majority acknowledges, should be no different, in\n\nresult, from the deliberate indifference standard.   As this court\n\nhas explained,\n\n     The \"reasonably related to a valid penological [interest]\n     standard\" never purported to allow recovery for mere\n     negligence. To the contrary, this test is deferential to jail\n     rulemaking; it is in essence a rational basis test of the\n     validity of jail rules. That is, asking whether a rule is\n     reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective is\n     much like asking whether a legislative enactment has any\n     rational basis, except in the context of jail administration\n     the legislative purpose is a given—typically a penological or\n     administrative purpose. Violation of the Bell test requires\n     acts or omissions not too distant from a standard of arbitrary\n     and capricious conduct.\n\nHare, 74 F.3d at 646.8    In Wolfish, the Court articulated the\n\ndeference courts must accord prison officials:\n\n     \"The problems that arise in the day-to-day operations of a\n     corrections facility are not susceptible of easy solutions.\n     Prison   administrators   therefore  should   be   accorded\n     wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of\n\n     8\n      See also Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 542, 99 S.Ct. at 1875 (citing\nrational basis cases to support the use of a reasonable\nrelationship test); id. at 586, 99 S.Ct. at 1898 (Stevens J.,\ndissenting) (\"In short, a careful reading of the Court's opinion\nreveals that it has attenuated the detainee's constitutional\nprotection against punishment into nothing more than a\nprohibition against irrational classifications or barbaric\ntreatment.

In this case, the question is whether the\n\ncity's policies are reasonably related to the goal of providing a\n\nsafe detention center for female detainees. In other words, do the\n\nalleged deficiencies with the city's policies prove that those\n\npolicies were arbitrary and capricious?\n\n     The custom at issue is broader than that which the majority\n\ndescribes.      The majority is correct that it is a custom to have\n\nfour guards—two of whom are women—and to split their duties into\n\nfour shifts over a twenty-four-hour period.               The policy also\n\nincludes provisions to protect female detainees from some types of\n\nsexual molestation.        Additionally, the city requires substantial\n\nbackground checks of its applicants.\n\n     The plaintiff has failed to show the existence of facts\n\ndemonstrating that the city's custom was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe city took precautions to protect the safety of female inmates\n\n                                      22\n\fand made a decision to staff its jails based on limited financial\n\nresources.      There is no evidence demonstrating that, objectively,\n\nsuch a policy generally would fail to protect pretrial detainees.\n\nIn fact, the evidence demonstrated that for ten years, the city had\n\nnot received any complaints of sexual assaults.               The city's choice\n\nmay not have been perfect, but it was not unconstitutional.

Scott, appeals the summary\n\njudgment dismissal of her 42 U.S.C. § 1983 inadequate staffing\n\nclaim against the City of Killeen, Texas (\"the City\"), and its\n\nChief of Police, Francis L. Giacomozzi.     Because we conclude that\n\na material fact issue remains in dispute, we VACATE and REMAND to\n\nthe district court for further proceedings.\n\n                      I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n     The   plaintiff/appellant,   Artelia   Scott,   was    arrested   on\n\nDecember 31, 1988, for public intoxication, assault, and resisting\n\narrest.    She was taken to the Killeen City Jail, processed by the\n\nfemale jailer on duty at that time, and placed in a holding cell to\n\nawait arraignment.   When the female jailer's shift ended, she was\n\nrelieved by a male jailer, defendant George Moore.         At that time,\n\nMoore was the only correctional officer on duty.      Over the course\n\nof his eight hour shift, Moore repeatedly entered Scott's cell and\n\n\n                                  1\n\fsexually assaulted her.     Scott was unable to report the incidents\n\nuntil she was released from custody on January 2, 1989, because\n\nMoore followed her to the phone and stood next to her during her\n\nthree telephone calls to her mother.\n\n     When    Chief   Giacomozzi    received   Scott's   complaint   against\n\nMoore, he asked Scott to give a statement to the police and take a\n\nlie detector test.       Scott agreed to do so.         After the results\n\nindicated that Scott was telling the truth, Giacomozzi transferred\n\nthe matter to the criminal investigation division, and placed Moore\n\non administrative leave.          Moore resigned four days later, and\n\nsubsequently pleaded guilty to criminal charges.\n\n     Scott filed suit in state court against Moore, the City, and\n\nChief Giacomozzi, alleging various state and federal constitutional\n\nclaims.     Moore subsequently declared bankruptcy and was dismissed\n\nfrom the suit after the bankruptcy proceeding discharged Scott's\n\nclaim against him.      The City and Giacomozzi removed the case to\n\nfederal court, where they filed their first motion for summary\n\njudgment.     Scott did not file a response, and the district court\n\ngranted the motion.      On appeal, this court affirmed the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment on all grounds except inadequate\n\nstaffing of the jail, as both the defendants' motion and the\n\ndistrict court's ruling failed to address this aspect of Scott's\n\nsuit.1\n\n     After remand, the City and Giacomozzi filed a second motion\n\n\n     1\n      Scott v.

In\n\naddition, female prisoners booked into the jail must be \"thoroughly\n\nand completely searched\" by female personnel with the jailer\n\nremaining       nearby,   then   placed   in    a   cell   separated   from   male\n\nprisoners.       And finally, the regulations provide that \"[a]nytime a\n\nprisoner is released from his or her cell for any reason other than\n\nrelease from custody, the prisoner shall be searched upon release\n\nfrom and return to the cell.\"         The General Order does not regulate\n\nthe number of jailers needed to staff the jail.21\n\n     Appellant Scott conceded at oral argument that this policy is\n\n\n     20\n          Id.\n     21\n      The General Order contains only three references to\nstaffing: 1) \"[t]he Jailer shall be the booking officer when on\nduty;\" 2) \"[i]n the absence of an on-duty Jailer, the assigned\ndesk officer shall assume the overall duties and responsibilities\nof the jailer;\" and 3) \"the arresting officer shall book his or\nher own prisoner if the desk officer is not available\".\n\n                                          7\n\fconstitutional as written.          Therefore, the General Order is not an\n\nactionable \"official policy\" under the first definition of that\n\nterm.22       Scott contends, however, that there is an \"unofficial\"\n\nstaffing policy which is actionable under the second definition of\n\n\"official policy.\"         We agree.\n\n        Since the late 1970's the City jail has been staffed by four\n\njailers, with one jailer working each of four shifts:            a.m., p.m.,\n\nday, and relief.          At the time of Scott's detention, two male and\n\ntwo female employees filled these positions.                  Thus, a female\n\ndetainee would necessarily be guarded by a single male jailer at\n\nsome    time     during    a   twenty-four   hour   period.    This    staffing\n\narrangement made it difficult, if not impossible, for the City\n\njailers to follow the mandates of the General Order.23                Yet, this\n\nconflict between the written General Order and the day-to-day\n\nstaffing procedures existed for at least ten years before Scott's\n\ndetention.        In this situation, we conclude that the consistent\n\ncustom or \"unofficial policy\" of having only one unsupervised male\n\njailer present when a female detainee is in the jail constitutes an\n\n\"official policy\" for the purposes of § 1983 liability.24\n\n       22\n            Webster, 735 F.2d at 841.\n       23\n      For example, if a female prisoner has to leave her cell\nwhile a single male jailer is on duty, the jailer will have to\nviolate either the rule that the prisoner be searched both upon\nexiting and reentering her cell, or the rule that all searches of\nfemale prisoners be done by a female employee. In this case,\nScott left her cell a least three times to use the telephone.\n       24\n      See Monell, 436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036, (a\n\"permanent and well settled\" custom may provide basis for\nimposing liability on a municipality) (quoting Adickes v.

Because the General Order reflects common concerns\n\nabout the safety and privacy of female inmates, the decision to\n\ncontradict the mandates of the General Order can actually be\n\ninterpreted as a sign of deliberate disregard of the constitutional\n\nrights of female prisoners.\n\n       It is our opinion that a reasonable jury could find that the\n\nunofficial staffing policy at the Killeen City Jail resulted in a\n\nviolation of Scott's constitutional rights, and that the City's\n\nactions in allowing such inadequate staffing went beyond negligent\n\noversight of prisoners' Constitutional rights.

Because   there    is    no   showing—even     remotely—of   a\n\n       42\n      In fact, the deposition testimony of Chief Giacomozzi\nindicates that the officer in charge of the jail had the\ndiscretion to call extra officers from the Killeen City Police\nDepartment to the jail in times of need.

The majority concludes, without explanation,\n\n\n                                     14\n\fthat the city's custom of allowing a single male to guard a female\n\ndetainee is a condition of confinement.           At a high level of\n\ngenerality, this could be so, in the sense that one of the\n\nconditions in the jail is a lack of extra guards.         But, at that\n\nlevel of generality, the omission that led to the suicide in Hare\n\nalso could be called a \"condition of confinement\":      A condition in\n\nthe jail was the lack of a guard to watch over the suicidal\n\ndetainee.\n\n      The problem with the majority's approach is that it ignores\n\nboth the common-sense understanding of \"conditions of confinement\"\n\nand the reasons articulated in Hare for distinguishing those\n\nconditions from episodic acts or omissions.        In Hare, this court\n\ncarefully distinguished episodic acts or omissions from conditions\n\nof confinement.     We did so because a pretrial detainee has a due\n\nprocess right to be free from punishment, and a hardship amounts to\n\npunishment when there is an intent to punish.         See Wolfish, 441\n\nU.S. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1873 (\"A court must decide whether the\n\ndisability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it\n\nis but an incident of some other legitimate governmental purpose.\")\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      When asking whether a jailer intended to punish a detainee,\n\nthe   reasonable   relationship   test   works   comfortably   in   \"jail\n\ncondition cases,\" because intent can be presumed in the form of the\n\nchallenged condition, practice, rule, or restriction.          Hare, 74\n\nF.3d at 644.       Thus, when the hardship of which the detainee\n\ncomplains is the very act of imposing a condition, practice, rule,\n\n\n                                  15\n\for restriction, the only question is whether there is a reasonable\n\nrelationship to a legitimate state interest.         In the case of\n\nepisodic acts or omissions, on the other hand, the reasonable\n\nrelationship test is more difficult to apply, as intent cannot be\n\npresumed.1\n\n     The lesson of Hare is that a condition of confinement is a\n\ncondition, practice, rule, or restriction that itself is the wrong\n\nof which the detainee complains.      The common-sense interpretation\n\nof a \"condition of confinement\" includes the number of bunks in a\n\ncell, the number of showers and meals per day, and even a policy of\n\ndaily beatings.2   The intent to impose the hardship can be presumed\n\n\n     1\n      Hare, 74 F.3d at 645 (\"Asking about the rationality of the\nrelationship between an official's episodic acts or omissions and\na legitimate governmental objective begs the underlying question\nwhether that official had the requisite mental state to establish\nhis liability as a perpetrator of the particular act or omission,\nnot as a dispenser of intended conditions or restrictions.\").\n     2\n      See, e.g. Murphy v.

One cannot infer an intent to cause the wrong merely\n\nfrom the existence of the challenged policy.         Certainly, if the\n\ncity's policy were the complained-of disability (such as in a\n\ndouble-bunking   case),   the   standard   for   municipal   and   jailer\n\nliability theoretically could merge.3 In this case, it should not.4\n\n     3\n      I pause to point out that Hare dealt with the question of\nwhen a detainee's constitutional rights have been violated. As\nthe court pointed out, determining the existence of a\nconstitutional violation is only the first step in determining\nmunicipal liability for that violation. Hare, 74 F.3d at 649 n.\n4.\n\n          In the case of an omission or episodic act, the\n     existence of a constitutional violation would be determined\n     by the subjective deliberate indifference standard.\n     Municipal liability for that violation would be determined\n     under the objective deliberate indifference standard.\n\n            We separate the two issues: the existence of a\n            constitutional violation simpliciter and a\n            municipality's liability for that violation. Different\n            versions of the deliberate indifference test govern the\n            two inquiries. Our opinion in this case makes clear\n            that to prove an underlying constitutional violation in\n            an individual or episodic acts case, a pre-trial\n            detainee must establish that an official acted with\n            subjective deliberate indifference. Once the detainee\n            has met this burden, she has proved a violation of her\n            rights under the Due Process Clause. To succeed in\n            holding a municipality accountable for that due process\n            violation, however, the detainee must show that the\n            municipal employee's act resulted from a municipal\n            policy or custom adopted or maintained with objective\n            deliberate indifference to the detainee's\n            constitutional rights.\n\n     Id.\n\n          If a non-policymaker imposed a condition of confinement\n     on a detainee, see, e.g., Bryer v.

To\n     determine municipal liability for the violation, the\n     objective deliberate indifference test would be used,\n     because a policymaker did not promulgate a policy of\n     imposing that condition of confinement.\n\n          The majority has assumed that when a policymaker\n     creates the condition of confinement, the standards for\n     determining the underlying constitutional violation and\n     municipal liability are the same.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989).    The plaintiff relies on the affidavit of\n\nCharles Craig, an expert on jail policy, who averred that his\n\nexperience showed him that a prison should have female officers to\n\nprevent sexual assaults, or that male officers should be supervised\n\nwhen allowed access to female inmates. He concluded that a failure\n\nto have two guards or a female guard could not be justified.\n\n     The record also establishes that the city has followed the\n\nsame staffing procedures since the late 1970's, yet no incident\n\nsuch as this has transpired.5      Jailers were subjected to a number\n\nof background checks, including a polygraph test,6 and the city\n\nlimited contact   between   male   and   female   jailers   in   order   to\n\nminimize the possibility of sexual misconduct.7             The jail is\n\n     5\n      There is no evidence that Chief Giacomozzi has ever had any\ncomplaints of sexual assault by a jailer or any related type of\ncomplaint prior to the incident at issue here.\n     6\n      The City subjected Moore, the perpetrator of this incident,\nto a background investigation, medical examination and polygraph\ntest as a condition of his employment. In addition, Moore had\nbeen previously employed as a commissioned police officer,\nwithout incident, for four years prior to his employment with the\njail. He was trained in the official policies of jail management\nby experienced jailers.\n     7\n      General Order MSC-1-78 (\"the General Order\"), which\nregulates the management of the city jail, prohibits male\npersonnel from frisking or conducting a pat-down search of a\nfemale prisoner. It also requires that a female be searched by\nfemale personnel. Moreover, anytime a prisoner is released from\nher cell for any reason, the General Order requires that she be\nsearched upon release from and return to the cell. Finally, the\npolicy allows for additional staffing by commissioned officers of\nthe police department when the holding facility's population is\nlarge or if a difficult prisoner is in custody.\n\n          The majority claims that the staffing policy made it\n     inevitable that the General Order would be disregarded. I\n     find nothing in the record to support such a conclusion or\n     inference. The majority bases its conclusion on the fact\n\n                                   19\n\flocated on the first floor of the police department, in the patrol\n\ndivision area, and a patrol duty sergeant would periodically check\n\non jail personnel. More than one hundred uniformed police officers\n\nin the building had unlimited access to the jail at all times.\n\n       There is no jury question as to whether the failure to have\n\nadditional staffing amounts to deliberate indifference.           The city\n\ntook   numerous   precautions   to    safeguard   the   safety   of   female\n\ndetainees, including the requirements of the General Order and the\n\nextensive background checks of the jailers. See Rhyne, 973 F.2d at\n\n393 (finding that the existence of a policy—albeit an inadequate\n\none—demonstrated that the municipality was not indifferent, in the\n\nliteral sense of the word).          A patrol sergeant was assigned to\n\nmonitor the jail and would periodically stop by to check on jail\n\npersonnel.\n\n       In summary, Craig's testimony does not establish that the city\n\npolicymakers faced an obvious risk and were consciously indifferent\n\nto it.    At most, the evidence could be construed to show that the\n\njail might have been better managed, or even that Giacomozzi was\n\nnot prescient in failing to consider the risk that well-trained\n\njailers would, without warning, assault a female detainee.\n\n                                     II.\n\n       Even assuming that the \"reasonable relationship\" test should\n\napply to this case, there is no jury question as to whether the\n\n\n       that the four jailers could not possibly follow the General\n       Order. What the majority fails to consider is that the jail\n       is located where the jailers could easily call for a\n       uniformed officer to assist them when a female detainee is\n       booked and searched.\n\n                                     20\n\fcity's custom was reasonably related to a legitimate government\n\ninterest.   I find the majority's conclusions surprising;      the\n\nopinion can be supported only by misunderstanding the summary\n\njudgment evidence and by failing to apply the deference that\n\nWolfish demands.\n\n     The reasonable relationship test is a highly deferential test\n\nthat, as the majority acknowledges, should be no different, in\n\nresult, from the deliberate indifference standard.   As this court\n\nhas explained,\n\n     The \"reasonably related to a valid penological [interest]\n     standard\" never purported to allow recovery for mere\n     negligence. To the contrary, this test is deferential to jail\n     rulemaking; it is in essence a rational basis test of the\n     validity of jail rules. That is, asking whether a rule is\n     reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective is\n     much like asking whether a legislative enactment has any\n     rational basis, except in the context of jail administration\n     the legislative purpose is a given—typically a penological or\n     administrative purpose. Violation of the Bell test requires\n     acts or omissions not too distant from a standard of arbitrary\n     and capricious conduct.\n\nHare, 74 F.3d at 646.8    In Wolfish, the Court articulated the\n\ndeference courts must accord prison officials:\n\n     \"The problems that arise in the day-to-day operations of a\n     corrections facility are not susceptible of easy solutions.\n     Prison   administrators   therefore  should   be   accorded\n     wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of\n\n     8\n      See also Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 542, 99 S.Ct. at 1875 (citing\nrational basis cases to support the use of a reasonable\nrelationship test); id. at 586, 99 S.Ct. at 1898 (Stevens J.,\ndissenting) (\"In short, a careful reading of the Court's opinion\nreveals that it has attenuated the detainee's constitutional\nprotection against punishment into nothing more than a\nprohibition against irrational classifications or barbaric\ntreatment.

In other words, do the\n\nalleged deficiencies with the city's policies prove that those\n\npolicies were arbitrary and capricious?\n\n     The custom at issue is broader than that which the majority\n\ndescribes.      The majority is correct that it is a custom to have\n\nfour guards—two of whom are women—and to split their duties into\n\nfour shifts over a twenty-four-hour period.               The policy also\n\nincludes provisions to protect female detainees from some types of\n\nsexual molestation.        Additionally, the city requires substantial\n\nbackground checks of its applicants.\n\n     The plaintiff has failed to show the existence of facts\n\ndemonstrating that the city's custom was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe city took precautions to protect the safety of female inmates\n\n                                      22\n\fand made a decision to staff its jails based on limited financial\n\nresources.      There is no evidence demonstrating that, objectively,\n\nsuch a policy generally would fail to protect pretrial detainees.\n\nIn fact, the evidence demonstrated that for ten years, the city had\n\nnot received any complaints of sexual assaults.               The city's choice\n\nmay not have been perfect, but it was not unconstitutional.                     See\n\nWolfish,   441    U.S.   at   542   n.    25,   99    S.Ct.   at    1876   n.   25\n\n(\"Governmental action does not have to be the only alternative or\n\neven the best alternative for it to be reasonable, to say nothing\n\nof constitutional.\").\n\n      \"Courts must be mindful that these injuries spring from\n\nconstitutional requirements and that judicial answers to them must\n\nreflect that fact rather than a court's idea of how best to operate\n\na   detention    facility.\"     Id.      at   539,   99   S.Ct.    at   1874.    I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f</pre>",
