However, if the funds are Fiduciary Funds, they may be maintained\nin an investment or account which is authorized by the law applicable to the entrustment or the\nterms of the instrument governing the Fiduciary Funds.\n\n (e) Acceptable account title: The lawyer must specifically identify an IOLTA Account\n[account] with the words ‘‘IOLTA Trust Account’’ or ‘‘IOLTA Escrow Account’’ and the name\nof the lawyer or the law firm who maintains the account in the main title of the account.\n\n (f) Acceptable title on checks/deposit slips: The word ‘‘IOLTA’’ need not be placed on checks\nor deposit slips.\n\n (g) Provision of Information[.]: The Eligible Institution must provide the following information\nto the IOLTA Board and to the lawyer who maintains the IOLTA Account at the time of each\nremittance:\n\n   (i) The name of the account;\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f   (ii) The service charges or fees deducted, if any;\n\n   (iii) The amount of income remitted from the account;\n\n   (iv) The rate of income applicable to each account; and\n\n   (v) If available, the average daily balance in the IOLTA Account.\n\n§ 81.106.

Prior\nto changing a rate of interest or dividend that was previously approved by the IOLTA\nBoard, or when the rate of interest or dividend for comparable products exceeds the rate\nlisted in the Eligible Institution’s most recently approved Compliance Certification Form,\nthe [The] Eligible Institution shall [be responsible for filing] submit a new Compliance\nCertification Form [when information previously provided] to the IOLTA Board [becomes\ninaccurate] for review and approval.\n\n (d) Remittance of income: All income earned under the IOLTA program must be remitted to\nthe IOLTA Board at least every quarter. Eligible Institutions shall honor requests by the\nIOLTA Board to recover income that was not remitted to the IOLTA Board, in accordance\nwith the Eligible Institution’s most recently approved Compliance Certification Form,\nduring the twelve months preceding the IOLTA Board’s request.\n\n§ 81.112. Refunds.\n\n (a) The IOLTA Board may return income paid to the IOLTA Board under certain\ncircumstances. [If] For example, if a lawyer mistakenly places Nonqualified Funds in an\nIOLTA Account, or if the lawyer reasonably believed that Rule 1.15 Funds were Qualified\nFunds, but the Rule 1.15 Funds were in fact not Qualified Funds, then the lawyer may apply for a\nrefund of income paid to the IOLTA Board. Additionally, if an Eligible Institution\nerroneously remits to the IOLTA Board income that should have been properly directed to\na different jurisdiction’s interest on lawyers trust account program, then the impacted\n\n\n                                                4\n\flawyer, financial institution, or other jurisdiction’s interest on lawyers trust account\nprogram may apply for a refund of the income paid to the IOLTA Board.\n\n (b) The following guidelines apply to requests [applications] for [return of income] a\nrefund:\n\n    (i) [The lawyer must make the application in writing on firm letterhead.] All requests\nmust be made on the letterhead of the party making the request (i.e., the impacted lawyer,\nfinancial institution, or other jurisdiction’s interest on lawyers trust account program), and\nall requests must set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the requested refund.\n\n   (ii) [The application] Requests must be accompanied by verification [from] of the income\npaid for which a refund is sought. Verification must be made by the Eligible Institution [in]\nat which the IOLTA Account is maintained [of the income earned on the Rule 1.15 Funds for\nwhich a refund is sought]. As needed for auditing purposes, the IOLTA Board may request\nadditional documentation.\n\n   (iii) The [application must be] IOLTA Board will only consider requests where the\nincome to be refunded was received by the IOLTA Board [within six months after the Rule\n1.15 Funds have been disbursed from the IOLTA Account] during the twelve-month period\nprior to the IOLTA Board receiving the written request for a refund.\n\n   (iv) [The refund] Refunds will be remitted through the Eligible Institution that\ntransmitted the income to the [lawyer for his/her distribution to the Third Party Owner.\nThe] IOLTA Board [will issue] unless an alternative method is requested and agreed to by\nthe IOLTA Board. [IRS (Internal Revenue Service) form 1099 to the lawyer who, in turn, is\nresponsible for issuing an IRS form 1099 to the Third Party Owner.]\n\n   (v) If the Eligible Institution has imposed a service charge with respect to the [deposit]\nIOLTA Account, only the net amount of income paid to the IOLTA Board (reduced by\napplicable service charges) will be refunded.\n\n   (vi) The IOLTA Board may impose and deduct a processing charge from the refund.\n\n\n\n                                          Appendix A\n\n       The Pennsylvania Interest on Lawyers\n              Trust Account Board\n\n\n                                                5\n\f  Promulgated by the Pennsylvania Interest on\n  Lawyers Trust Account Board and Approved\n     by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\n\n These [regulations] Regulations are to be read and applied in connection with the Pennsylvania\nRules of Professional Conduct. Nothing in these [regulations] Regulations shall be construed to\nrelieve a lawyer of any provision of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct. Where\nthese [regulations] Regulations contain directives pertaining to the Interest on Lawyers Trust\nAccount program which are more specific than those set forth in the Pennsylvania Rules of\nProfessional Conduct, the provisions of these [regulations] Regulations shall control.\n\n\n           Questions and Answers Concerning\n                  Pennsylvania IOLTA\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\n\n        The following is a representation of the questions most frequently asked of the\nPennsylvania Interest on Lawyers Trust Account Board (the ‘‘IOLTA Board’’) and the answers\ngiven. Some of the answers paraphrase the actual Rules of Professional Conduct or Regulations\nof the IOLTA Board. Reference should be made to the Rules and to the Regulations when\nappropriate.\n\nWhat is the Basic Concept of IOLTA?\n\n         Clients and third persons frequently transfer monies to lawyers to hold. Rule 1.15 of the\nPennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct generally requires the lawyer to deposit all monies\nof clients and third persons (‘‘Rule 1.15 Funds’’) in a Trust Account. When the amount is large\nor if the funds will be held for an extended period of time, lawyers invest them for the benefit of\nthe owner. These funds are known as Nonqualified Funds. But when the funds are nominal in\namount or expected to be held for a short time, they cannot practically be invested to benefit the\nowner of the funds. These funds are Qualified Funds.\n\n        Rule 1.15 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct requires a lawyer to deposit\nQualified Funds in a particular type of Trust Account: an [income producing] income-\nproducing IOLTA Account. The result is that funds that would otherwise earn no income can be\nput to constructive use.\n\n       The lawyer’s Eligible Institution transfers the income earned on IOLTA Accounts\n(‘‘IOLTA Funds’’), no less frequently than quarterly, to the IOLTA Board. The IOLTA Board\n\n                                                 6\n\fdistributes the IOLTA Funds for the delivery of civil legal assistance to the poor and\ndisadvantaged, educational legal clinical programs and internships administered by law schools,\nthe administration of justice, and for the administration and development of the IOLTA program.\n\nHow do lawyers comply with the IOLTA requirements of Rule 1.15?\n\n      IOLTA Accounts may be maintained only at Eligible Institutions approved by the\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania.\n\n         An ‘‘Enrollment Form for Lawyers and Law Firms’’ can be used to direct the Eligible\nInstitution to open or convert one or more of the lawyer’s Trust Account(s) to [income\nproducing] income-producing IOLTA Accounts. Submit the second copy of the enrollment\nform, along with a list of all the lawyers who use the IOLTA Account in the regular course of\ntheir practice, to the IOLTA Board.\n\n       On an annual basis as part of the licensing process, lawyers are required to certify\ncompliance with Rule 1.15 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct regarding the\nhandling of funds and other property of clients or third persons (‘‘Third Party Owners’’) and the\nmaintenance of their IOLTA Accounts.\n\nWhat will happen if a lawyer does not comply with Rule 1.15?\n\n        If a lawyer does not comply with the requirements outlined in Rule 1.15 of the\nPennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct, he or she will be subject to the same disciplinary\npenalties as any lawyer who does not comply with any of the other requirements for the practice\nof law in Pennsylvania.\n\n      The IOLTA Board will refer to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel the names of lawyers\nwho do not comply with IOLTA.\n\nAre any exemptions from IOLTA participation allowed?\n\n        Yes, a lawyer may apply for an exemption from the requirement that all Qualified Funds\nbe placed in an IOLTA Account. However, the exemption will be granted by the IOLTA Board\nonly for one of the reasons specified in Rule 1.15. Write to the IOLTA Board if you believe any\nof the permitted exemptions apply. Exemptions will be granted if:\n\n   [(A) the nature of the lawyer’s practice does not require the routine maintenance of a\nTrust Account in Pennsylvania;]\n\n    [(B) the establishment of an IOLTA Account would work an undue hardship on the\nlawyer or would be extremely impractical, based either on the geographical distance\nbetween the lawyer’s principal office and the closest Eligible Institution or on other\ncompelling and necessitous factors;]\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f     [(C) the lawyer’s historical annual Trust Account experience, based on information\nfrom the Eligible Institution in which the lawyer deposits Rule 1.15 Funds, demonstrates\nthe service charges on the Trust Account would significantly and routinely exceed any\nincome generated.]\n\n      (i) Low balance account: If the average daily balance of your current IOLTA\nAccount, as measured over twelve months, is less than $5,000, you may request an\nexemption.\n\n       (ii) Account service charges routinely exceed income: If the bank service charges\nassessed on your current IOLTA Account routinely exceed the income earned, you may\nrequest an exemption.\n\n      (iii) Extreme impracticality or undue hardship: Under limited circumstances it\nwould be unduly burdensome for a lawyer to maintain a Trust Account as an IOLTA\nAccount. An example includes the lack of an Eligible Institution that offers IOLTA\nAccounts in the lawyer’s geographical location.\n\n       (iv) Other compelling and necessitous reasons: There may be compelling and\nnecessitous reasons justifying an exemption from the requirement that the lawyer maintain\na Trust Account as an IOLTA Account. A lawyer who demonstrates a compelling and\nnecessitous reason for not complying with the IOLTA Board Regulations may request an\nexemption. A philosophical objection to the IOLTA Program or the IOLTA Board\nRegulations does not constitute a compelling and necessitous reason for an exemption.\n\nWhat funds are to be placed in IOLTA Accounts?\n\n       Qualified Funds are monies of a client or third person received by a lawyer, that in the\n[good faith] Good Faith judgment of the lawyer, are nominal in amount or which the lawyer\nreasonably expects to be held for such a short period of time that sufficient income will not be\ngenerated to justify the expense of earning income to benefit the client or third person.\n\n       A lawyer will not be liable for damages or held to have breached his or her professional\nresponsibility because monies are deposited in an IOLTA Account pursuant to the lawyer’s\njudgment in [good faith] Good Faith that the monies are Qualified Funds.\n\n        However, the lawyer should review the funds held in his/her IOLTA Account at\nreasonable intervals to determine whether circumstances have changed that require changes with\nrespect to the Rule 1.15 Funds held in the IOLTA Account.\n\nWho pays taxes on the income earned on IOLTA accounts?\n\n        Nobody. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ruled that there are no tax consequences\nto the Third Party Owner, the lawyer or the IOLTA Board. Also, there is no IRS reporting\nrequirement for the lawyer, Eligible Institution or Third Party Owner since all IOLTA accounts\nwill use the Tax Identification Number of the IOLTA Board.\n\n                                                 8\n\fMay a lawyer still open a separate account for funds of Third Party Owners?\n\n        Certainly. Rule 1.15 Funds are defined to include funds received from a client or third\nperson in connection with a client-lawyer relationship, as an escrow agent, settlement agent,\nrepresentative payee, or as a Fiduciary. Rule 1.15 Funds also include funds received as an agent,\nhaving been designated as such by a client or having been selected as such because of a client-\nlawyer relationship or the lawyer’s status as a lawyer. The lawyer must determine whether Rule\n1.15 Funds are Qualified Funds or Nonqualified Funds. Nonqualified Funds shall be placed\neither in a Trust Account or in another investment vehicle specifically agreed upon by the lawyer\nand the Third Party Owner. Nonqualified Funds which are Fiduciary Funds shall be placed either\nin a Trust Account or in another investment or account which is authorized by the law applicable\nto the entrustment or the terms of the instrument governing the Fiduciary Funds.\n\nHow does the IOLTA program affect financial institutions?\n\n       Financial [institutions] Institutions are not mandated to participate in IOLTA. However,\n[financial institutions] Financial Institutions that wish to offer Trust Accounts into which\nlawyers can deposit Rule 1.15 Funds (whether Qualified or Nonqualified Funds) must be\napproved by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. A list of Eligible Institutions can be obtained\nfrom the Disciplinary Board.\n\n        An IOLTA Account is an unsegregated Trust Account for the deposit of Qualified Funds\nby a lawyer. The income payable on an IOLTA Account cannot be less than the highest rate of\ninterest or dividend generally available from the Eligible Institution to its non-IOLTA Account\ncustomers when the IOLTA Account meets or exceeds the same minimum balance and other\naccount eligibility qualifications. Eligible Institutions remit income earned at least quarterly to\nthe IOLTA Board.\n\n       Eligible Institutions must transmit to the IOLTA Board and to the lawyer who maintains\nthe IOLTA Account a statement showing certain information. This includes, at a minimum, the\nname of the account, the service charges or fees deducted, if any, and the amount remitted from\nthe lawyer’s IOLTA Account. If available, the Eligible Institution shall also provide information\nregarding the average daily balance in the account.\n\nWhere do IOLTA Funds go?\n\n       Income earned on IOLTA Accounts may be used only for the following purposes:\n\n           (1) delivery of civil legal assistance to the poor and disadvantaged in Pennsylvania by\n               non-profit corporations which are tax-exempt under the Internal Revenue Code;\n\n           (2) educational legal clinical programs and internships administered by law schools\n               located in Pennsylvania;\n\n           (3) the administration of justice in Pennsylvania; and\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f           (4) the administration and development of the IOLTA program in Pennsylvania.\n\n      All disbursements and allocations of IOLTA funds are subject to the prior approval of the\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania.\n\nWho is the IOLTA Board?\n\n      The IOLTA Board is the Pennsylvania Interest on Lawyers Trust Account Board\ncomposed of nine members appointed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhat if a lawyer mistakenly deposits funds which are not Qualified Funds into an IOLTA\nAccount?\n\n         As long as the lawyer used [good faith] Good Faith judgment, the lawyer will not be\nliable in damages for placing Nonqualified Funds into an IOLTA Account, nor will the lawyer be\nheld to have breached any fiduciary duty or responsibility because monies were deposited into an\nIOLTA Account. Additionally, if timely requested, a refund of income earned on an IOLTA\nAccount and received by the IOLTA Board attributable to the mistaken deposit, net of an\nadministrative charge, will be returned to the remitting Eligible Institution, unless an\nalternative method is approved by the IOLTA Board [made to the lawyer for distribution\nto the Third Party Owner].\n\nMay all lawyers in a law firm use the same IOLTA Account?\n\n        Yes. If a law firm established an IOLTA Account, each lawyer who deposits all Qualified\nFunds in that account will be deemed to be in compliance with IOLTA. This account must be set\nup according to IOLTA [regulations] Regulations. Each lawyer is ultimately responsible to\nensure that he or she is in compliance with IOLTA.\n\nWhere may a lawyer deposit Qualified Funds?\n\n         IOLTA Accounts must be maintained in an Eligible Institution. An Eligible Institution is\na Financial Institution which has been approved as a depository for trust accounts pursuant to\nRule 221(h) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement (\"Pa. R.D.E.\"). Financial\nInstitutions include those entities which are identified in Rule 1.15(a)(4) and Pa. R.D.E.\n221(a)(2). Information regarding Eligible Institutions can be found at www.paiolta.org. Eligible\nInstitutions have various deposit insurance arrangements, and some may not have deposit\ninsurance for some deposit arrangements. Lawyers are reminded of their responsibility under\nRule 1.15(b) to safeguard appropriately all funds and property in the lawyer’s possession in\nconnection with a client-lawyer relationship.\n\nWhat if a lawyer only practices law for part of the year?\n\n        The lawyer must comply with the IOLTA rules, even if he or she only practices law for\npart of the year.\n\n\n                                               10\n\fWhat types of legal employment are excluded from IOLTA?\n\n        A lawyer whose employment does not result in the handling of Rule 1.15 Funds will\ngenerally be excluded from IOLTA. Examples include corporate or governmental lawyers,\njudges, and law school professors as long as they do not maintain a private practice.\n\nWhat are some factors which should be used to determine whether monies are Qualified Funds?\n\n        Factors which can be used to determine which monies are Qualified Funds include: (1)\nthe cost to the lawyer of establishing and maintaining account(s) benefiting the client or third\nperson; (2) the Eligible Institution’s service charges; (3) the minimum deposit requirements; (4)\nthe accounting fees; (5) the tax reporting requirements; (6) the nature of the transaction(s) or\nproceedings(s) involved; and (7) the likelihood of delay in the relevant transaction(s) or\nproceeding(s).\n\nMust a lawyer who receives funds while acting as a fiduciary deposit those funds into an IOLTA\nAccount?\n\n        Rule 1.15, as amended on September 4, 2008, specifically includes funds received by a\nlawyer as a personal representative, guardian, conservator, receiver, trustee, agent under durable\npower of attorney, or other similar positions as Rule 1.15 Funds. As such, those funds, pursuant\nto Rule 1.15(b), must be maintained separate from the lawyer’s own property. Pursuant to Rule\n1.15(d), Fiduciary Funds continue to be governed by the law, procedure and rules governing the\nrequirements of confidentiality and notice applicable to the fiduciary entrustment. Pursuant to\nthe provisions of Rule 1.15(e), the delivery, accounting and disclosure of Fiduciary Funds\ncontinues to be governed by the law, procedure and rules governing the requirements of\nfiduciary administration, confidentiality, notice and accounting applicable to the fiduciary\nentrustment. If the Fiduciary Funds are Qualified Funds, they may be deposited in an IOLTA\nAccount, or they may be maintained in another account consistent with the Fiduciary\nentrustment.\n\nMust a lawyer who receives funds of clients or third persons other than in connection with a\nclient-lawyer relationship deposit those funds in a Trust Account, including an IOLTA Account?\n\n       Under certain circumstances, yes. The responsibilities of a lawyer which are identified in\nRule 1.15 with respect to funds of clients or third persons are not restricted to funds received in\nconnection with a client-lawyer relationship. The lawyer’s responsibilities with respect to such\nfunds may arise under Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15, 5.7 or both.\n\n        As amended by Order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania dated September 4, 2008,\nthe definition of Rule 1.15 Funds specifically includes funds which the lawyer receives from a\nclient or third person as an escrow agent, settlement agent, representative payee, as an agent\nhaving been designated as such by a client, or having been selected as an agent as a result of a\nclient-lawyer relationship or the lawyer’s status as a lawyer. Those funds are subject to Rule\n1.15 and must be kept separate from the lawyer’s own property. Pursuant to Rule 1.15(k), all\nNonqualified Funds which are not Fiduciary Funds shall be placed in a Non-IOLTA Account or\n\n                                                11\n\fin another investment vehicle specifically agreed upon by the lawyer and the Third Party Owner.\nQualified Funds must be placed in an IOLTA Account.\n\n         Rule of Professional Conduct 5.7 provides that a lawyer is subject to the Pennsylvania\nRules of Professional Conduct with respect to the provision of both legal and nonlegal services if\na lawyer provides nonlegal services that are not distinct from legal services. Rule of Professional\nConduct 5.7(e) defines “nonlegal services” as “services that might reasonably be performed in\nconjunction with and in substance are related to the provision of legal services, and that are not\nprohibited as unauthorized practice of law when provided by a [non lawyer] nonlawyer.” Even\nif the nonlegal services are distinct from legal services, the lawyer is still subject to the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct: (i) if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the recipient of the\nservices might believe that the recipient is receiving the protection of a client-lawyer\nrelationship, or (ii) if the lawyer is an owner, controlling party, employee, agent, or is otherwise\naffiliated with an entity providing nonlegal services and the lawyer knows or reasonably should\nknow that the recipient of the service might believe that the recipient is receiving the protection\nof a client-lawyer relationship. In each of these cases, the lawyer will be subject to the\nobligations of Rule 1.15 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct and these\nRegulations as if a client-lawyer relationship existed with the recipient of the services. The\nlawyer then must deposit all funds of the client or a third person which are received in\nconnection with that relationship in a Trust Account, regardless of whether the funds resulted\nfrom legal or nonlegal services. If the funds are Qualified Funds, those funds are to be placed in\nan IOLTA Account.\n\nWho pays the service charges for IOLTA Accounts?\n\n       Account service charges on an IOLTA Account will be paid by offsetting the service\ncharges against income earned on that account.\n\n       Bank charges pertaining to the lawyer’s practice (e.g. check printing charges, overdraft\ncharges, charges for temporary extensions of credit, etc.) and costs billable to others (e.g.\noverdraft charges on deposited items, certified checks, wire transfers, etc.), will be the\nresponsibility of the lawyer.\n\nHow can I find out more about IOLTA?\n\n        For additional information concerning IOLTA, contact the office of the IOLTA Board by\ncalling (717) 238-2001. The IOLTA Board’s fax number is (717) 238-2003.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f",
