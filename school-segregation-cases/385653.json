Defendant, the District of Columbia, opposes the\n\nmotion. Upon consideration of the parties’ papers, the relevant legal authorities, and pertinent\n\nportions of the record in this case, the Court grants in part and denies in part plaintiff’s motion,\n\nand awards to plaintiff fees and costs in the amount of $20,162.75, representing $20,090.50 in\n\nattorneys’ fees and $72.25 in costs. 1\n\n\n\n       1\n                The papers considered in connection with the pending motion include: plaintiff’s\nmotion for attorneys’ fees and costs (“Fee Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 2352]; defendant’s opposition to\nplaintiff’s motion (“Fee Opp.”) [Dkt. No. 2380]; plaintiff’s reply in support of her fee motion\n(“Fee Reply”) [Dkt. No. 2383]; plaintiff’s first motion for preliminary injunction (“PI Mot.”)\n[Dkt. No. 2325]; defendant’s opposition to plaintiff’s first motion for preliminary injunction (“PI\nOpp.”) [Dkt. No. 2329]; plaintiff’s reply in support of her first motion for preliminary injunction\n(“PI Reply”) [Dkt. No. 2331]; plaintiff’s status report (“Status Report”) [Dkt. No. 2335];\nplaintiff’s second motion for preliminary injunction (“2d PI Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 2387]; the Report\n\f                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n               Plaintiff Denyce Hubbard is the legal guardian and next friend of T.C., a student\n\neligible to receive special education and related services from the District of Columbia Public\n\nSchools (“DCPS”). In December 2012, plaintiff filed a request for a due process hearing to\n\nchallenge T.C.’s educational placement under her individualized education program (“IEP”).\n\nR&R at 2. On January 28, 2013, an administrative hearing officer found that DCPS had denied\n\nT.C. a free, appropriate public education required under the IDEA when it failed to provide an\n\nappropriate placement for T.C. Id. The hearing officer ordered DCPS to place T.C. in a full-\n\ntime, segregated, therapeutic environment and to provide T.C. art therapy at least once a week\n\nfor the remainder of the 2012-2013 school year. Id.\n\n               DCPS did not provide art therapy in a timely fashion, however, and on June 21,\n\n2013, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. In her motion, plaintiff sought an order\n\ndirecting DCPS to immediately provide art therapy in compliance with the hearing officer\n\ndetermination and compensatory education for the services which T.C. had been denied. PI Mot.\n\nat 15.\n\n               The Court referred the preliminary injunction motion to Special Master Elise\n\nBaach. See Minute Order dated June 26, 2013. The parties presented their arguments to the\n\nSpecial Master on July 10, 2013. R&R at 6. After considering the parties’ arguments, the\n\nSpecial Master convened a teleconference with the parties on July 12, 2013, in which she\n\nexplained that “due to the delay in providing art therapy, T.C. would prevail in this action,” and\n\nshe “asked the parties to discuss the details of a proposed order regarding T.C.’s art therapy\n\n\nand Recommendations of the Special Master on plaintiff’s second motion for preliminary\ninjunction (“R&R”) [Dkt. No. 2406]; the January 7, 2014 Order adopting the Report and\nRecommendations of the Special Master (“Jan. 7, 2014 Order”) [Dkt. No. 2412]; and the parties’\nnotice of settlement of certain claims (“Notice of Settlement”) [Dkt. No. 2463].\n                                                 2\n\fsessions.” Id. On July 19, 2013, plaintiff filed a status report notifying the Court that the parties\n\nhad reached an agreement regarding the art therapy sessions. Status Report at 1; R&R at 6. The\n\nCourt subsequently denied the motion for preliminary injunction as moot. See Minute Order\n\ndated August 5, 2013.\n\n                Plaintiff now moves for an award of $27,179.00 in attorneys’ fees and $72.25 in\n\ncosts for the time and effort involved in obtaining the favorable settlement. 2\n\n\n                                      II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n                The Court previously has set forth the appropriate analytical framework for\n\ndetermining the award of attorneys’ fees and costs in special education cases like this one. See\n\nBlackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 59 F. Supp. 2d 37, 42-44 (D.D.C. 1999). To recover reasonable\n\nattorneys’ fees, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that he or she is a prevailing party in the\n\nlitigation. Id. at 40-41; see also Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp. 2d 36, 42-45\n\n(D.D.C. 2004). For a party to constitute a prevailing party, it must have succeeded on a\n\nsignificant issue raised in the litigation and secured some of the benefit sought. Hensley v.\n\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983) (internal quotation omitted). In addition, this benefit must\n\nreflect a change in the legal relationship between the parties, and that change must be judicially\n\nsanctioned in some way. Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 45 (citing\n\nBuckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S.\n\n598, 604-05 (2001)). Once it has determined that the plaintiff is a prevailing party, the Court\n        2\n                Approximately two months after the parties settled plaintiff’s first motion for\ninjunctive relief – the motion that led to the fee petition at issue here – the plaintiff filed a second\nmotion for preliminary injunction to compel the District to comply with certain terms of that\nsettlement. See 2d PI Mot. The motion was referred to the Special Master, who issued a Report\nand Recommendations in favor of the plaintiff, see R&R, which was adopted by the Court. See\nJan. 7, 2014 Order. The parties subsequently reached an agreement with respect to attorneys’\nfees for the second preliminary injunction. See Notice of Settlement. The instant fee petition\nthus is confined to expenses incurred in litigating plaintiff’s first preliminary injunction motion.\n                                                   3\n\fthen must determine whether the fees sought are reasonable by calculating “the number of hours\n\nreasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate” – the so-called\n\n“lodestar” fee. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. at 433. See e.g., In re Olson, 884 F.2d 1415,\n\n1423 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Sierra Club v. Jackson, 926 F. Supp. 2d 341, 346 (D.D.C. 2013).\n\n               On the issue of reasonableness, a plaintiff must submit supporting documentation\n\nwith the motion for attorneys’ fees, providing sufficient detail so that the Court can determine\n\n“with a high degree of certainty” that the hours billed were actually and reasonably expended,\n\nthat the hourly rate charged was reasonable in view of the attorney’s reputation and level of skill\n\nand experience with respect to this type of case, and that the matter was appropriately staffed to\n\ndo the work required efficiently and without duplicative billing. In re Olson, 884 F.2d at 1423,\n\n1428-29 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation omitted); see Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S.\n\nat 433; Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 397 F. Supp. 2d 12, 14 (D.D.C. 2005). At a minimum, a\n\nfee applicant must provide some information about the attorney’s billing practices, hourly rates,\n\nand skill and experience, as well as the nature of the attorney’s practice as it relates to this kind\n\nof litigation and the prevailing market rates in the community. Rooths v. Dist. of Columbia, 802\n\nF. Supp. 2d 56, 60 (D.D.C. 2011); Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 397 F. Supp. 2d at 14-15.\n\nOnce a plaintiff has provided such information, there is a presumption that the number of hours\n\nbilled and the hourly rate are reasonable, and the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the\n\nplaintiff’s showing of reasonable hours and reasonable hourly rates for attorneys of the relevant\n\nlevel of skill and expertise. See Watkins v. Vance, 328 F. Supp. 2d 23, 26 (D.D.C. 2004). “[I]n\n\nthe normal case the Government must either accede to the applicant’s requested rate or provide\n\nspecific contrary evidence tending to show that a lower rate would be appropriate.” Covington\n\nv. Dist. of Columbia, 57 F.3d 1101, 1109-10 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (quoting Nat’l Ass’n of Concerned\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fVeterans v. Sec’y of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, 1326 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); see also Rooths v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 802 F. Supp. 2d at 60.\n\n\n                                          III. DISCUSSION\n\n               In support of her motion for fees, plaintiff has submitted an itemized invoice\n\ndocumenting the hours billed by the two attorneys and one paralegal who worked on this case\n\nand the bill of costs. Statement of Attorneys’ Fees and Bill of Costs, Fee Mot. Ex. 19. Plaintiff\n\nalso has filed declarations by the two attorneys and one paralegal attesting to their levels of\n\nexperience and billing practices. Declaration of Charles Moran (“Moran Decl.”), Fee Mot. Ex.\n\n15; Declaration of Tanjima Islam (“Islam Decl.”), Fee Mot. Ex. 17; Declaration of Steve Nabors\n\n(“Nabors Decl.”), Fee Mot. Ex. 18.\n\n               The District opposes the motion on the grounds that plaintiff cannot achieve\n\n“prevailing party” status under a settlement agreement and that the number of hours and the\n\nhourly rates billed by plaintiff’s counsel are unreasonably high. See Fee Opp. These arguments\n\nare addressed in turn.\n\n\n                 A. Fees May Be Awarded For A Settlement Agreement Entered Into\n                              Under Supervision Of The Special Master\n\n               As a procedural matter, the District objects to paying any fees because the\n\nplaintiff has not received a judicial decision and therefore is not a prevailing party. See Fee Opp.\n\nat 7-9. This argument is foreclosed by this Court’s decision in Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia,\n\n328 F. Supp. 2d 36 (D.D.C. 2004), where the Court held that a settlement agreement entered into\n\nunder the supervision of the Special Master in this case is sufficient to effect a judicially\n\nsanctioned change in the legal relationship between two parties. Id. at 44-45.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f               In its 2004 Blackman decision, the Court observed that plaintiffs who obtain\n\nfavorable settlements outside of court typically are not “prevailing parties” under the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health &\n\nHuman Res., 532 U.S. 598, as there has been no judicially sanctioned alteration in the parties’\n\nlegal relationship. Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 41-42. The Court went on\n\nto explain, however, that the Blackman/Jones case – and the settlements reached in this case\n\nthrough the Special Master’s efforts – are unique. In this class action, the legal relationship\n\nbetween the District and the individual class members changed upon the Court’s 1998 Order\n\nholding the District liable for violations of the IDEA. Id. at 39, 45; see Blackman v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, Civ. Action Nos. 97-1629/97-2402, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23889 (D.D.C. June 3,\n\n1998). Although the Court did not issue a class-wide injunction at the time, the Court appointed\n\na Special Master in 1999 “‘for the limited purposes of assisting the Court in resolving the\n\nrequests for immediate injunctive relief,’” to “‘ensure that the noncompliance with the IDEA\n\nwhich gave rise to liability does not cause irreparable injury to any individual class member\n\npending the determination of class-wide relief.’” Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 39 (quoting Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 185 F.R.D. 4, 5 (D.D.C. 1999)).\n\n               Given these circumstances, the Court found that the settlement agreements\n\nnegotiated by the Special Master were not typical, out-of-court settlements – rather, they served\n\nto actualize the change in the parties’ legal relationship that occurred with the Court’s finding of\n\nliability in 1998. Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 44-45. The Court also\n\nfound that “[a]s the Court’s agent . . . the Special Master provides the process with sufficient\n\nCourt oversight to ensure that the concerns expressed in Buckhannon regarding requisite judicial\n\nimprimatur of settlements are met.” Id. at 45.\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f                This Court’s 2004 Blackman decision established the law of the case on this issue,\n\nand the District has not provided any basis for reconsidering that decision. The Court has\n\nreviewed the legal authorities cited by the District, including Alegria v. Dist. of Columbia, 391\n\nF.3d 262 (D.C. Cir. 2004), and Smith ex rel. Battle v. Dist. of Columbia, 117 F. App’x 767, 768\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2004), and finds these cases distinguishable. See generally Alegria v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 391 F.3d 262 (finding that parties that obtained favorable settlements prior to\n\nadministrative proceedings were not “prevailing” under Buckhannon); Smith ex rel. Battle v.\n\nDist. of Columbia, 117 F. App’x at 768 (same).\n\n                The District attempts to distinguish the present dispute from the Court’s 2004\n\ndecision, but that decision – unlike the D.C. Circuit’s opinions in Alegria and Smith – is directly\n\non point. In both matters, the plaintiffs obtained favorable settlement agreements or hearing\n\nofficer determinations at the administrative level. Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 39-40; R&R at 2-4. In both matters, the plaintiffs then filed preliminary injunction motions\n\nin Blackman/Jones to enforce these settlement agreements and hearing officer determinations.\n\nBlackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 40; PI Mot. In both matters, the motions\n\nwere referred to the Special Master, who facilitated resolutions in which the plaintiffs obtained\n\nrelief. Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 40; R&R at 5-7; see supra at 2-3. And\n\nin both matters, the preliminary injunction motions were then denied as moot by this Court.\n\nBlackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 40; Minute Order of August 5, 2013. Under\n\nthe law of the case, the plaintiff is a prevailing party and is entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n                                   B. The Hourly Rates Are Reduced\n\n                Plaintiff seeks fees for the services of two lawyers and one paralegal, to be paid at\n\nthe following rates: $505 per hour for Charles A. Moran, an attorney with 47 years of litigation\n\n                                                   7\n\fexperience, 25 years primarily in the field of special education; $245 per hour for Tanjima Islam,\n\nan attorney with less than one year of litigation experience, primarily in the field of special\n\neducation; and $145 per hour for Steve Nabors, who was working as a paralegal at the time. Fee\n\nMot. at 7-8; see Moran Decl. ¶¶ 3, 10; Islam Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4, 7; Nabors Decl. ¶¶ 1, 7.\n\n               The hourly rates invoiced for the Mr. Moran and Mr. Nabors are the equivalent of\n\nthose established by the so-called Laffey Matrix. See Laffey Matrix – 2003-2014, available at\n\nhttp://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/Laffey_Matrix%20214.pdf. That schedule of\n\nattorneys’ fees, first developed based on information about the prevailing rates charged by\n\nfederal litigators in the District of Columbia, is maintained by the United States Attorney’s\n\nOffice for the District of Columbia. See id. n.1-3. In this circuit, the rates contained in the\n\nLaffey Matrix are typically treated as the highest rates that will be presumed to be reasonable\n\nwhen a court reviews a petition for statutory attorneys’ fees. See Rooths v. Dist. of Columbia,\n\n802 F. Supp. 2d at 61; Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 59 F. Supp. 2d at 43.\n\n               Although the USAO Laffey Matrix provides an appropriate starting point for a\n\ndetermination of a reasonable rate, the rates contained in the matrix represent, as already noted,\n\npresumptive maximum rates. Furthermore, those maximum rates are appropriately paid in\n\nactions constituting “complex federal litigation.” Covington v. Dist. of Columbia, 57 F.3d at\n\n1103. Many judges of this Court, including the undersigned, generally cap attorneys’ fees at\n\nthree-quarters of the Laffey rate for routine IDEA cases – where the claims involve “simple\n\nfacts, little evidence, and no novel or complicated questions of law.” Rooths v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 802 F. Supp. 2d at 63; see McAllister v. Dist. of Columbia, — F. Supp. 2d —, 2014\n\nWL 2921020, at *4 (D.D.C. 2014) (collecting cases); Sykes v. Dist. of Columbia, 870 F. Supp.\n\n2d 86, 96 (D.D.C. 2012). The District asserts that this case is straightforward and does not\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\finvolve novel or complicated questions of law, and therefore fees at a rate equal to three-quarters\n\nthe Laffey rate are appropriate. Fee Opp. at 10-13. Plaintiff argues that this case was not a\n\nstraightforward IDEA claim because “it required joining a federal class action, filing a\n\npreliminary injunction, and arguing before the Special Master before relief was obtained.” Fee\n\nMot. at 8-9. 3\n\n                 The Court agrees that plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is much more\n\nakin to a routine IDEA case than the sort of complex litigation that would merit compensation at\n\nthe full Laffey rate. The dispute was presented and resolved in a relatively informal setting\n\nbefore the Special Master. Plaintiff has not shown that the case involved complicated legal or\n\nevidentiary issues. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Mr. Moran’s hourly rate\n\nshould be capped at $382.50, equal to three-quarters of the relevant Laffey rate. 4 Because the\n\ndifficulty of work performed by paralegals is unlikely to vary in accordance with the complexity\n\nof legal issues litigated in the case, however, the Court does not apply the cap of three-quarters\n\nthe Laffey rate to paralegal/clerk work. Accordingly, the Court finds that Mr. Nabors’ rate\n\nshould remain at $145 per hour.\n\n                 The District further challenges Ms. Islam’s hourly rate of $245, the Laffey rate for\n\nan attorney who has been practicing law for one to three years. Fee Opp. at 13. The Court\n\nagrees that this rate is excessive, as Ms. Islam was not admitted to the District of Columbia Bar\n\n        3\n                 Plaintiff also argues that the fee award should be upwardly adjusted because the\nDistrict litigated in bad faith. Fee Mot. at 10-16. The Court does not find evidence of bad faith\nmeriting an increase in the fee award.\n        4\n                In their papers, both parties indicate that the relevant Laffey rate is $505,\nrepresenting the June 2012 – May 2013 rate for an attorney with 20 or more years of experience.\nSee Declaration of Charles A. Moran ¶ 11, Ex. 15 to Fee Mot.; Fee Opp. at 13. Because Mr.\nMoran’s services were rendered in June 2013 through August 2013, however, the Court relies on\nthe rate for June 2013 – May 2014, which is $510 per hour. See Laffey Matrix – 2003-2014.\n\n\n                                                  9\n\funtil July 12, 2013, after the majority of her contribution to the present case. Islam Decl. ¶ 3; see\n\nElectronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 982 F. Supp. 2d 56, 61\n\n(D.D.C. 2013) (holding that the Laffey rate for an attorney “does not kick in until the graduate is\n\nadmitted to a bar, and work by graduates who have not yet been admitted to any bar shall be\n\ncompensated at the paralegal/clerk rate”). Accordingly, the Court finds that Ms. Islam’s rate will\n\nbe the $145 hourly rate for paralegals for all work done prior to her admission to the bar. For\n\nreasons explained supra, Ms. Islam’s rate for all work done after admission to the bar will be\n\ncapped at $187.50, equal to three-quarters the relevant Laffey rate. 5\n\n               In addition, the District argues that the billing statement contains items that\n\nshould be billed at a further reduced rate. The District asserts that Mr. Moran’s travel to and\n\nfrom the conference before the Special Master should be compensated at half his hourly rate.\n\nFee Opp. at 15. The Court agrees and will reduce the award for the July 10, 2013 billing entries\n\nregarding travel accordingly. See Cooper v. United States R.R. Retirement Bd., 24 F.3d 1414,\n\n1417 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (allowing fees for travel time at half the attorney’s hourly rate); Doe v.\n\nRumsfeld, 501 F. Supp. 2d 186, 193 (D.D.C. 2007) (same).\n\n               The District also contends that all fees for preparation of the fee motion should be\n\nawarded at half the Laffey rate because the litigation for fees involved no complicated issues or\n\nextensive preparation. Fee Opp. at 16. The Court disagrees. The District contested plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for attorneys’ fees and raised legal issues that went beyond standard reasonableness of\n\n\n\n\n       5\n               In their papers, both parties indicate that the relevant Laffey rate is $245, again\nrepresenting the June 2012 – May 2013 rate for an attorney with 1-3 years of experience. See\nIslam Decl. ¶ 7; Def.’s Opp. Fee Mot. at 13. Because Ms. Islam’s services as an attorney were\nrendered in August 2013, however, the Court relies on the rate for June 2013 – May 2014, which\nis $250 per hour. See Laffey Matrix – 2003-2014.\n                                                 10\n\fhours arguments. Accordingly, the Court will not further reduce the hourly rate for the billing\n\nentries involving preparation of the fee motion.\n\n\n                              C. The Hours Billed Are Reduced In Part\n\n               The District argues that plaintiff’s invoice contains several vague and\n\nunwarranted billing entries that appear to serve no purpose in furtherance of plaintiff’s claim.\n\nFee Opp. at 14-15. As noted above, the documentation provided by plaintiffs must contain\n\nsufficient detail to permit the Court to determine “with a high degree of certainty” that the hours\n\nbilled were reasonable. In re Olson, 884 F.2d at 1428-29 (emphasis in the original). The District\n\nasserts that the billing entry for Mr. Nabors’ 30 minute telephone call with outside counsel Doug\n\nTyrka “re: Injunctive relief under Jones” is vague and unwarranted because Mr. Nabors could\n\nhave instead had a discussion with his boss, Mr. Moran. Fee Opp. at 14. While excessive\n\ncollaboration with outside counsel might be unreasonable, the consultation with outside counsel\n\non this issue was brief and, as plaintiff points out, less expensive than the District’s proposed\n\nalternative. Under the government’s scenario, the plaintiff should have billed for Mr. Nabors’\n\ntime plus Mr. Moran’s time. Here, only Mr. Nabors’ time was billed, as Mr. Tyrka did not\n\ncharge plaintiff for his time. The Court concludes that this fee is reasonable.\n\n               The District similarly challenges seven entries, dated July 1 and July 3, 2013,\n\ndocumenting plaintiff’s counsel’s collaboration with Jones Class Counsel as vague with unclear\n\npurpose. Fee Opp. at 14-15. The billing entries, however, indicate the subject of the\n\nconversations, and requiring further detail would be overly burdensome. Furthermore, the time\n\nexpended on the collaboration was just 102 minutes and seems quite reasonable. Accordingly,\n\nthe Court finds these charges to be sufficiently detailed and will award these fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   11\n\f               The District next asserts that the two entries dated July 23, 2013, regarding Mr.\n\nMoran’s email correspondence with the Special Master “re: second due process complaint” are\n\n“wholly irrelevant” because the correspondence occurred after plaintiff had filed a status report\n\nnotifying the Court that the parties had reached an agreement. Fee Opp. at 15. The Court agrees\n\nthat these entries do not appear to relate to the preliminary injunction motion at issue here, see\n\nsupra at note 2, and therefore will deduct eighteen minutes.\n\n               The District also contends that the three entries dated June 5, 2013 concerning\n\nemails with class counsel regarding facts on timeliness are “irrelevant because there was no\n\ntimeliness issue in this case.” Fee Opp. at 14. The Court disagrees and will award these fees, as\n\nthe preliminary injunction motion clearly involved an issue regarding the timeliness of providing\n\nart therapy sessions. See PI Mot. at 7-8. 6\n\n               Accordingly, it is hereby\n\n               ORDERED that [Dkt. No. 2352] plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees is\n\nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part; and it is\n\n               FURTHER ORDERED that the District of Columbia shall pay plaintiff\n\n$20,162.75, representing $20,090.50 in attorneys’ fees and $72.25 in costs, on or before August\n\n18, 2014.

Defendant, the District of Columbia, opposes the\n\nmotion. Upon consideration of the parties’ papers, the relevant legal authorities, and pertinent\n\nportions of the record in this case, the Court grants in part and denies in part plaintiff’s motion,\n\nand awards to plaintiff fees and costs in the amount of $20,162.75, representing $20,090.50 in\n\nattorneys’ fees and $72.25 in costs. 1\n\n\n\n       1\n                The papers considered in connection with the pending motion include: plaintiff’s\nmotion for attorneys’ fees and costs (“Fee Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 2352]; defendant’s opposition to\nplaintiff’s motion (“Fee Opp.”) [Dkt. No. 2380]; plaintiff’s reply in support of her fee motion\n(“Fee Reply”) [Dkt.

BACKGROUND\n\n               Plaintiff Denyce Hubbard is the legal guardian and next friend of T.C., a student\n\neligible to receive special education and related services from the District of Columbia Public\n\nSchools (“DCPS”). In December 2012, plaintiff filed a request for a due process hearing to\n\nchallenge T.C.’s educational placement under her individualized education program (“IEP”).\n\nR&R at 2. On January 28, 2013, an administrative hearing officer found that DCPS had denied\n\nT.C. a free, appropriate public education required under the IDEA when it failed to provide an\n\nappropriate placement for T.C. Id. The hearing officer ordered DCPS to place T.C. in a full-\n\ntime, segregated, therapeutic environment and to provide T.C. art therapy at least once a week\n\nfor the remainder of the 2012-2013 school year. Id.\n\n               DCPS did not provide art therapy in a timely fashion, however, and on June 21,\n\n2013, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. In her motion, plaintiff sought an order\n\ndirecting DCPS to immediately provide art therapy in compliance with the hearing officer\n\ndetermination and compensatory education for the services which T.C. had been denied. PI Mot.\n\nat 15.\n\n               The Court referred the preliminary injunction motion to Special Master Elise\n\nBaach. See Minute Order dated June 26, 2013. The parties presented their arguments to the\n\nSpecial Master on July 10, 2013. R&R at 6. After considering the parties’ arguments, the\n\nSpecial Master convened a teleconference with the parties on July 12, 2013, in which she\n\nexplained that “due to the delay in providing art therapy, T.C. would prevail in this action,” and\n\nshe “asked the parties to discuss the details of a proposed order regarding T.C.’s art therapy\n\n\nand Recommendations of the Special Master on plaintiff’s second motion for preliminary\ninjunction (“R&R”) [Dkt. No. 2406]; the January 7, 2014 Order adopting the Report and\nRecommendations of the Special Master (“Jan. 7, 2014 Order”) [Dkt. No. 2412]; and the parties’\nnotice of settlement of certain claims (“Notice of Settlement”) [Dkt. No. 2463].\n                                                 2\n\fsessions.” Id. On July 19, 2013, plaintiff filed a status report notifying the Court that the parties\n\nhad reached an agreement regarding the art therapy sessions. Status Report at 1; R&R at 6. The\n\nCourt subsequently denied the motion for preliminary injunction as moot. See Minute Order\n\ndated August 5, 2013.\n\n                Plaintiff now moves for an award of $27,179.00 in attorneys’ fees and $72.25 in\n\ncosts for the time and effort involved in obtaining the favorable settlement. 2\n\n\n                                      II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n                The Court previously has set forth the appropriate analytical framework for\n\ndetermining the award of attorneys’ fees and costs in special education cases like this one. See\n\nBlackman v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2408595\"><a href=\"/opinion/2408595/blackman-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42-44 (D.D.C. 1999). To recover reasonable\n\nattorneys’ fees, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that he or she is a prevailing party in the\n\nlitigation. Id. at 40-41; see also Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438830\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438830/blackman-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

For a party to constitute a prevailing party, it must have succeeded on a\n\nsignificant issue raised in the litigation and secured some of the benefit sought.

In addition, this benefit must\n\nreflect a change in the legal relationship between the parties, and that change must be judicially\n\nsanctioned in some way. Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Once it has determined that the plaintiff is a prevailing party, the Court\n        2\n                Approximately two months after the parties settled plaintiff’s first motion for\ninjunctive relief – the motion that led to the fee petition at issue here – the plaintiff filed a second\nmotion for preliminary injunction to compel the District to comply with certain terms of that\nsettlement. See 2d PI Mot. The motion was referred to the Special Master, who issued a Report\nand Recommendations in favor of the plaintiff, see R&R, which was adopted by the Court. See\nJan. 7, 2014 Order. The parties subsequently reached an agreement with respect to attorneys’\nfees for the second preliminary injunction. See Notice of Settlement. The instant fee petition\nthus is confined to expenses incurred in litigating plaintiff’s first preliminary injunction motion.\n                                                   3\n\fthen must determine whether the fees sought are reasonable by calculating “the number of hours\n\nreasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate” – the so-called\n\n“lodestar” fee.

In re Olson, 884 F.2d at 1423,\n\n1428-29 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation omitted); see Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S.\n\nat 433; Blackman v.

At a minimum, a\n\nfee applicant must provide some information about the attorney’s billing practices, hourly rates,\n\nand skill and experience, as well as the nature of the attorney’s practice as it relates to this kind\n\nof litigation and the prevailing market rates in the community.

The Court went on\n\nto explain, however, that the Blackman/Jones case – and the settlements reached in this case\n\nthrough the Special Master’s efforts – are unique. In this class action, the legal relationship\n\nbetween the District and the individual class members changed upon the Court’s 1998 Order\n\nholding the District liable for violations of the IDEA.

Although the Court did not issue a class-wide injunction at the time, the Court appointed\n\na Special Master in 1999 “‘for the limited purposes of assisting the Court in resolving the\n\nrequests for immediate injunctive relief,’” to “‘ensure that the noncompliance with the IDEA\n\nwhich gave rise to liability does not cause irreparable injury to any individual class member\n\npending the determination of class-wide relief.’” Blackman v.

Under\n\nthe law of the case, the plaintiff is a prevailing party and is entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n                                   B. The Hourly Rates Are Reduced\n\n                Plaintiff seeks fees for the services of two lawyers and one paralegal, to be paid at\n\nthe following rates: $505 per hour for Charles A. Moran, an attorney with 47 years of litigation\n\n                                                   7\n\fexperience, 25 years primarily in the field of special education; $245 per hour for Tanjima Islam,\n\nan attorney with less than one year of litigation experience, primarily in the field of special\n\neducation; and $145 per hour for Steve Nabors, who was working as a paralegal at the time. Fee\n\nMot. at 7-8; see Moran Decl. ¶¶ 3, 10; Islam Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4, 7; Nabors Decl. ¶¶ 1, 7.\n\n               The hourly rates invoiced for the Mr. Moran and Mr. Nabors are the equivalent of\n\nthose established by the so-called Laffey Matrix. See Laffey Matrix – 2003-2014, available at\n\nhttp://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/Laffey_Matrix%20214.pdf. That schedule of\n\nattorneys’ fees, first developed based on information about the prevailing rates charged by\n\nfederal litigators in the District of Columbia, is maintained by the United States Attorney’s\n\nOffice for the District of Columbia. See id. n.1-3. In this circuit, the rates contained in the\n\nLaffey Matrix are typically treated as the highest rates that will be presumed to be reasonable\n\nwhen a court reviews a petition for statutory attorneys’ fees. See Rooths v. Dist. of Columbia,\n\n802 F. Supp. 2d at 61; Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia, 59 F. Supp. 2d at 43.\n\n               Although the USAO Laffey Matrix provides an appropriate starting point for a\n\ndetermination of a reasonable rate, the rates contained in the matrix represent, as already noted,\n\npresumptive maximum rates. Furthermore, those maximum rates are appropriately paid in\n\nactions constituting “complex federal litigation.” Covington v. Dist. of Columbia, 57 F.3d at\n\n1103. Many judges of this Court, including the undersigned, generally cap attorneys’ fees at\n\nthree-quarters of the Laffey rate for routine IDEA cases – where the claims involve “simple\n\nfacts, little evidence, and no novel or complicated questions of law.” Rooths v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 802 F. Supp. 2d at 63; see McAllister v. Dist. of Columbia, — F. Supp. 2d —, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2921020</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (D.D.C. 2014) (collecting cases); Sykes v.

Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 86, 96 (D.D.C. 2012). The District asserts that this case is straightforward and does not\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\finvolve novel or complicated questions of law, and therefore fees at a rate equal to three-quarters\n\nthe Laffey rate are appropriate. Fee Opp. at 10-13. Plaintiff argues that this case was not a\n\nstraightforward IDEA claim because “it required joining a federal class action, filing a\n\npreliminary injunction, and arguing before the Special Master before relief was obtained.” Fee\n\nMot. at 8-9. 3\n\n                 The Court agrees that plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is much more\n\nakin to a routine IDEA case than the sort of complex litigation that would merit compensation at\n\nthe full Laffey rate. The dispute was presented and resolved in a relatively informal setting\n\nbefore the Special Master. Plaintiff has not shown that the case involved complicated legal or\n\nevidentiary issues. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Mr. Moran’s hourly rate\n\nshould be capped at $382.50, equal to three-quarters of the relevant Laffey rate. 4 Because the\n\ndifficulty of work performed by paralegals is unlikely to vary in accordance with the complexity\n\nof legal issues litigated in the case, however, the Court does not apply the cap of three-quarters\n\nthe Laffey rate to paralegal/clerk work. Accordingly, the Court finds that Mr. Nabors’ rate\n\nshould remain at $145 per hour.\n\n                 The District further challenges Ms. Islam’s hourly rate of $245, the Laffey rate for\n\nan attorney who has been practicing law for one to three years. Fee Opp. at 13. The Court\n\nagrees that this rate is excessive, as Ms. Islam was not admitted to the District of Columbia Bar\n\n        3\n                 Plaintiff also argues that the fee award should be upwardly adjusted because the\nDistrict litigated in bad faith. Fee Mot. at 10-16. The Court does not find evidence of bad faith\nmeriting an increase in the fee award.\n        4\n                In their papers, both parties indicate that the relevant Laffey rate is $505,\nrepresenting the June 2012 – May 2013 rate for an attorney with 20 or more years of experience.\nSee Declaration of Charles A. Moran ¶ 11, Ex. 15 to Fee Mot.; Fee Opp. at 13. Because Mr.\nMoran’s services were rendered in June 2013 through August 2013, however, the Court relies on\nthe rate for June 2013 – May 2014, which is $510 per hour. See Laffey Matrix – 2003-2014.\n\n\n                                                  9\n\funtil July 12, 2013, after the majority of her contribution to the present case. Islam Decl. ¶ 3; see\n\nElectronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61\n\n(D.D.C. 2013) (holding that the Laffey rate for an attorney “does not kick in until the graduate is\n\nadmitted to a bar, and work by graduates who have not yet been admitted to any bar shall be\n\ncompensated at the paralegal/clerk rate”). Accordingly, the Court finds that Ms. Islam’s rate will\n\nbe the $145 hourly rate for paralegals for all work done prior to her admission to the bar. For\n\nreasons explained supra, Ms. Islam’s rate for all work done after admission to the bar will be\n\ncapped at $187.50, equal to three-quarters the relevant Laffey rate. 5\n\n               In addition, the District argues that the billing statement contains items that\n\nshould be billed at a further reduced rate. The District asserts that Mr. Moran’s travel to and\n\nfrom the conference before the Special Master should be compensated at half his hourly rate.\n\nFee Opp. at 15. The Court agrees and will reduce the award for the July 10, 2013 billing entries\n\nregarding travel accordingly. See Cooper v. United States R.R. Retirement Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670646\"><a href=\"/opinion/670646/denver-s-cooper-v-united-states-railroad-retirement-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1417 (D.C.

Fee Opp. at 16. The Court disagrees. The District contested plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for attorneys’ fees and raised legal issues that went beyond standard reasonableness of\n\n\n\n\n       5\n               In their papers, both parties indicate that the relevant Laffey rate is $245, again\nrepresenting the June 2012 – May 2013 rate for an attorney with 1-3 years of experience. See\nIslam Decl. ¶ 7; Def.’s Opp. Fee Mot. at 13. Because Ms. Islam’s services as an attorney were\nrendered in August 2013, however, the Court relies on the rate for June 2013 – May 2014, which\nis $250 per hour. See Laffey Matrix – 2003-2014.\n                                                 10\n\fhours arguments. Accordingly, the Court will not further reduce the hourly rate for the billing\n\nentries involving preparation of the fee motion.\n\n\n                              C. The Hours Billed Are Reduced In Part\n\n               The District argues that plaintiff’s invoice contains several vague and\n\nunwarranted billing entries that appear to serve no purpose in furtherance of plaintiff’s claim.\n\nFee Opp. at 14-15. As noted above, the documentation provided by plaintiffs must contain\n\nsufficient detail to permit the Court to determine “with a high degree of certainty” that the hours\n\nbilled were reasonable. In re Olson, 884 F.2d at 1428-29 (emphasis in the original). The District\n\nasserts that the billing entry for Mr. Nabors’ 30 minute telephone call with outside counsel Doug\n\nTyrka “re: Injunctive relief under Jones” is vague and unwarranted because Mr. Nabors could\n\nhave instead had a discussion with his boss, Mr. Moran. Fee Opp. at 14. While excessive\n\ncollaboration with outside counsel might be unreasonable, the consultation with outside counsel\n\non this issue was brief and, as plaintiff points out, less expensive than the District’s proposed\n\nalternative. Under the government’s scenario, the plaintiff should have billed for Mr. Nabors’\n\ntime plus Mr. Moran’s time. Here, only Mr. Nabors’ time was billed, as Mr. Tyrka did not\n\ncharge plaintiff for his time. The Court concludes that this fee is reasonable.\n\n               The District similarly challenges seven entries, dated July 1 and July 3, 2013,\n\ndocumenting plaintiff’s counsel’s collaboration with Jones Class Counsel as vague with unclear\n\npurpose. Fee Opp. at 14-15. The billing entries, however, indicate the subject of the\n\nconversations, and requiring further detail would be overly burdensome. Furthermore, the time\n\nexpended on the collaboration was just 102 minutes and seems quite reasonable. Accordingly,\n\nthe Court finds these charges to be sufficiently detailed and will award these fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   11\n\f               The District next asserts that the two entries dated July 23, 2013, regarding Mr.\n\nMoran’s email correspondence with the Special Master “re: second due process complaint” are\n\n“wholly irrelevant” because the correspondence occurred after plaintiff had filed a status report\n\nnotifying the Court that the parties had reached an agreement. Fee Opp. at 15. The Court agrees\n\nthat these entries do not appear to relate to the preliminary injunction motion at issue here, see\n\nsupra at note 2, and therefore will deduct eighteen minutes.\n\n               The District also contends that the three entries dated June 5, 2013 concerning\n\nemails with class counsel regarding facts on timeliness are “irrelevant because there was no\n\ntimeliness issue in this case.” Fee Opp. at 14. The Court disagrees and will award these fees, as\n\nthe preliminary injunction motion clearly involved an issue regarding the timeliness of providing\n\nart therapy sessions. See PI Mot. at 7-8. 6\n\n               Accordingly, it is hereby\n\n               ORDERED that [Dkt.
