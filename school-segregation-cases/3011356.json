We assume the parties’ familiarity\n\nwith the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.\n\n          We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts “in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-moving party and draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.”\n\nCox v. Warwick Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 654 F.3d 267, 271 (2d Cir. 2011). Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate where “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “Where the record taken as a whole could\n\n\n\n     The Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to amend the official caption as set forth above. \n                                                    2\n\fnot lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.”\n\nMatsushita Elec.

Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n        An independent review of the record and relevant case law reveals that the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment to the defendants. Berry failed to demonstrate that the\n\ndefendants were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm to support his failure to\n\nprotect claim, see Hayes v. New York City Dep’t of Corrs., 84 F.3d 614, 620-21 (2d Cir. 1996), or\n\nthat Defendant-Appellant Beckwith’s use of pepper spray was excessive, see Hudson v.\n\nMcMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9 (1992); Sims v. Artuz, 230 F.3d 14, 21-22 (2d Cir. 2000). Beckwith and\n\nCastro, in any event, are entitled to qualified immunity. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n\n818 (1982). We therefore affirm for the reasons stated by the district court in its May 22, 2014\n\ndecision.\n\n         We have considered all of Berry’s remaining arguments and find them to be without\n\nmerit.
