Instead, the issue is to be determined\nafter an examination of “all the facts and circumstances.”\nComm’r v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 493 U.S. 203, 207\n(1990) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The\napplicable law is not uncertain. It is “settled that receipt of a\nloan is not income to the borrower.” Id. On the other hand,\nfunds received “are taxable as income upon receipt if they\nconstitute advance payments . . . .” Id. The courts’\ndeterminations as to which side of the line a particular payment\nfalls have not always been consistent. In the appeal before us we\nmust decide whether the Tax Court erred in characterizing the\npayment received by appellant as income, for which it had been\nissued a notice of deficiency.\n\n                                I.\n\n       Appellant Karns Prime & Fancy Food, Ltd., is a\nPennsylvania corporation that operates grocery stores in the\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania area. During the taxable year ended\nJanuary 30, 2000, Karns operated five grocery stores in\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania. Karns’ principal supplier was Super\nRite Foods, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Rich Foods, Inc.\nKarns’ CEO, Scott Karns, prepared a capital budget in 1998 and\ndetermined that Karns required $1.5 million for capital\n\n                                2\n\fimprovements in the coming years. Karns approached Dale\nConklin, President of Super Rite, about borrowing funds from\nSuper Rite. Super Rite did not generally make loans to its\ncustomers, but would, from time to time, make funds available to\n“certain of its creditworthy and strategically important\ncustomers.” Appellant’s Br. at 3. Due to Karns’ loan\nobligations with its primary lender – PNC Bank – Karns\nrequested and obtained a waiver from PNC in order to secure the\nfunds that Super Rite was willing to provide.\n\n       Super Rite requires customers to whom it provides\nfinancial assistance to enter into a Supply and Requirements\nAgreement (“Supply Agreement”) whereby the customer, in this\ncase Karns, agrees to purchase a minimum dollar amount of\nproducts from Super Rite. Super Rite also requires the customer\nto execute a promissory note payable to Super Rite in the\namount of the funds it provided. Thus, Super Rite agreed to\nmake $1.5 million immediately available to Karns and Karns\nexecuted a promissory note to Super Rite on April 15, 1999.\nKarns signed the Supply Agreement on April 16, 1999.1\n\n       Pursuant to that agreement, Karns agreed to repay the\nnote in six annual payments of $250,000. Significantly, the\nagreement provided that if Karns met the supply requirement for\nthe previous calendar year at issue by purchasing the stipulated\namount of Super Rite products, the $250,000 due and owing for\nthat year would be forgiven. Karns received the $1.5 million on\nMay 4, 1999. Karns recorded the note on its books as a long-\nterm note payable. Super Rite recorded the note as an asset and\namortized the note monthly over the six-year period.\n\n       A. The Supply and Requirements Agreement\n\n\n\n       1\n         Although there is apparently an inconsistency in the record\nas to the specific dates of the note and supply agreement, the Tax\nCourt stated that it is clear from the record that they “were entered\ninto around the same time and were interdependent.” Karns Prime\n& Fancy Food, Ltd. v. Comm’r, 90 T.C.M. (CCH) 357, 360 n.9\n(2005).\n\n                                 3\n\f        The Supply Agreement provided that Super Rite would be\nthe principal wholesaler for all of Karns’ purchased products in\nthe Harrisburg geographical area. Karns agreed to purchase $16\nmillion worth of product annually from Super Rite. In addition,\nKarns agreed to Super Rite’s general policies and practices in\neffect, with respect to, for instance, product pricing (Karns paid\na 2.5% markup for grocery products, 3% for dairy products, and\n3.5% for frozen products), billing and payment terms, and\nreturns and credits for purchased products. Under the terms of\nthe Agreement, Karns was given seven days to make payment\nfor its product purchases. Failure to do so constituted default,\nand Super Rite had the right to suspend shipments during the\nterm of default. Any default under the Supply Agreement also\nconstituted a default under the note, thus requiring the balance\nunder the note to become due immediately.\n\n        Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Super Rite\ncould cancel the Agreement if Karns filed for bankruptcy, failed\nto pay in accordance with the agreement, or was in default of\nany “material contract, instrument or agreement, including,\nwithout limitation, any lease of real property, any material lease\nof personal property or any promissory note, instrument or\nagreement evidencing or in respect of any indebtedness for\nborrowed money or any security therefor . . . .” App. at 52.\nKarns had the right to cancel the Agreement in the event that\nSuper Rite filed for bankruptcy protection. Karns granted Super\nRite a security interest in its assets, including inventory,\naccounts, equipment, and proceeds. Karns agreed to make its\ninternal financial statements available within ninety days of each\nfiscal quarter and a financial statement prepared by its\nindependent accountant every six months. Finally, Karns gave\nSuper Rite a right of first refusal if Karns’ shareholders sold\neither the corporation or its assets to a third party.\n\n       B. The Note\n\n       The promissory note had a face value of $1.5 million.\nInterest on the unpaid balance was to be paid at prime plus 1%.\nThe note was to be repaid in six annual payments of $250,000\ncommencing April 16, 2000 and continuing on the third Friday\nof each April thereafter up to and including April 16, 2005. The\n\n                                4\n\fnote also provided the following:\n\n      payment of the annual payment shall be forgiven by the\n      Lender if the Lender determines that Borrower is in\n      compliance with, and shall not have materially breached\n      or then be in uncured default under, that certain Supply\n      and Requirements Agreement of even date herewith\n      among the Borrower and Lender. The entire unpaid and\n      unforgiven principal balance hereof shall be due and\n      payable, if prior to April 16, 2005, Borrower ceases, for\n      any reason, to use Lender as its primary food supplier.\n\nApp. at 49 (emphasis added).\n\n      Karns spent $750,000 of the $1.5 million received from\nSuper Rite on capital improvements and temporarily invested the\nbalance in certificates of deposit. The CDs were then pledged to\nPNC as collateral for a new $960,000 loan from PNC. That\n$960,000 was in turn invested in further capital improvements.\n\n        In August 1999, SuperValu, Inc. acquired Rich Foods\n(parent of Super Rite). Soon thereafter, Karns decided to\nrelocate one of its stores. In order to satisfy the new lessor’s\nconcerns, Karns requested that SuperValu guarantee its new\nlease. On or about January 25, 2000, SuperValu agreed to\nguarantee Karns’ lease; in return the parties amended the April\n16, 1999 Supply Agreement to reflect the guarantee and Karns\nentered into several agreements with SuperValu, including, inter\nalia, an agreement that granted SuperValu a security interest in\nsome of Karns’ assets.\n\n        Karns satisfied the Supply Agreement for the periods\nending April 16, 2000 and April 16, 2001, “and otherwise\ncomplied with, did not materially breach, and was not in uncured\ndefault under that . . . agreement.” Karns Prime & Fancy Food,\nLtd. v. Comm’r, 90 T.C.M. (CCH) 357, 361 (2005). Because\nKarns fulfilled the purchase requirements and the other\ncovenants, the required annual payments of $250,000 on the\npromissory note were forgiven. In its January 30, 2001, and\nJanuary 30, 2002, tax returns Karns reported the debt\nforgiveness of $250,000 as “Other Income – Reduction of\n\n                               5\n\fSupplier Note Agreement.” App. at 39.\n\n       In 2001, Karns sought an additional $300,000 from\nSuperValu in order to facilitate a move to a new location vacated\nby Fleming Foods, a food wholesaler who declared bankruptcy.\nKarns needed the funds to buy out the remainder of its existing\nlease and to purchase inventory and fixtures at the new location.\nSuperValu agreed, and Karns executed a promissory note to\nSuperValu on March 9, 2001 in the amount of $300,000 with\ninterest at 10.7% per year. Karns executed new agreements,\nincluding a second amendment to the Supply Agreement, which\nincreased the annual purchase requirements from Super Rite\nfrom $16 to $21 million. The note called for debt service\npayments to be made annually from March 9, 2002 through\nMarch 9, 2005, but the new Supply Agreement did not extend\nthe term of the original Supply Agreement beyond April 16,\n2005.\n\n       Karns met the purchase requirement of $21 million for the\nperiod ending March 9, 2002, and therefore did not pay the\n$250,000 due annually under the note. For the period ended\nMarch 9, 2003, Karns purchased only $19.8 million from\nSuperValu, and it had to pay $4,929.19 toward the annual\npayment due under the March 9, 2001 note.\n\n                               II.\n\n       The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service\nmailed a notice of deficiency to Karns for its federal income tax\nyear ending January 30, 2000, in the amount of $486,355 on\nOctober 24, 2003. The basis for the claimed deficiency was\nKarns’ failure to include the $1.5 million payment from Super\nRite as income in its tax return. Karns timely petitioned the Tax\nCourt for a redetermination of the tax deficiency. The Tax Court\nhad jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §§ 6213(a), 6214, and\n7442. After a trial, the Court entered its decision on October 5,\n2005, holding that the $1.5 million payment to Karns was not a\nloan and thus was includable in Karns’ gross income. Karns, 80\nT.C.M. at 365. Karns filed a timely notice of appeal to this\ncourt. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7482(a)(1).\n\n\n                                6\n\f                                III.\n\n       The statutory definition of gross income includes income\n“from whatever source derived.” 26 U.S.C. § 61(a). The\nSupreme Court has defined “income” as “undeniable accessions\nto wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have\ncomplete dominion.” Comm’r v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S.\n426, 431 (1955). “In determining whether a taxpayer enjoys\n‘complete dominion’ over a given sum . . . . [t]he key is whether\nthe taxpayer has some guarantee that he will be allowed to keep\nthe money.” Comm’r v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 493\nU.S. 203, 210 (1990).\n\n       Generally, the receipt of a loan is not includable as gross\nincome, because the recipient of the loan has an obligation to\nrepay the amount loaned. Id. at 207-08. The loan proceeds are\nnot income to the taxpayer. Comm’r v. Tufts, 461 U.S. 300, 307\n(1983). A key question is whether, at the time of receipt of the\nfunds, the recipient of the loan was unconditionally obligated to\nmake repayment. To determine whether a given transaction\nconstitutes a loan, the substance, rather than the form, of the\ntransaction is controlling. Knetsch v. United States, 364 U.S.\n361, 365-66 (1960).\n\n       Most of the cases grappling with the issue have focused\non the treatment of advance payments for purposes of taxation,\nprobably because that was the factual pattern before the Supreme\nCourt in Indianapolis Power, the leading decision on this issue.\n\n        In Indianapolis Power, the Indianapolis Power & Light\nCompany (“IPL”) required “certain customers to make deposits\nwith it to assure payment of future bills for electric service.”\n493 U.S. at 204. Although IPL commingled the funds received\nwith other receipts and did not segregate them, it did not treat the\ndeposits as income on its books but instead carried them as\ncurrent liabilities. Id. at 205. The Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”) had a different view of the transactions. It viewed the\ndeposits as advance payments for electricity and assessed\ndeficiencies on the ground that the deposits were gross income,\ntaxable to IPL upon receipt. Id. at 204. The Tax Court\ndisagreed with the IRS. Id. at 206. It held that the principal\n\n                                 7\n\fpurpose of the deposits was to serve as security rather than as\nprepayment of income. Id. The Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit affirmed. Id.\n\n       The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the\nconflict between the Seventh Circuit’s decision and the Eleventh\nCircuit’s decision in City Gas Co. of Florida v. Comm’r, 689\nF.2d 943 (11th Cir. 1982). In the course of its opinion, the Court\nprovided guidance as to the distinction for taxation purposes\nbetween an advance payment and a loan. The Court stated, “[i]n\neconomic terms, . . . the distinction between a loan and an\nadvance payment is one of degree rather than of kind.”\nIndianapolis Power, 493 U.S. at 208. It explained, “[t]he issue\nturns upon the nature of the rights and obligations that [are]\nassumed” when the transaction occurs. Id. at 209.\n\n       The Court held that the advance deposits were not income\nto IPL when received, stating that “such dominion as IPL has\nover these customer deposits is insufficient for the deposits to\nqualify as taxable income at the time they are made.” Id. at 214.\nIn holding that the deposits were not the economic equivalent of\nadvance payments, the court noted that the customers who made\nthe deposits “retain[ed] the right to insist upon repayment in\ncash,” whereas the “individual who makes an advance payment\nretains no right to insist upon return of the funds; so long as the\nrecipient fulfills the terms of the bargain, the money is its to\nkeep.” Id. at 213.\n\n        In rejecting the IRS’s attempt to analogize the IPL\ncustomers’ security deposits to advance payments, the Court\nstated that although there was some similarity in that “[a]n\nadvance payment, like the deposits at issue here, concededly\nprotects the seller against the risk that it would be unable to\ncollect money owed it after it has furnished goods or services,”\nan advance payment does much more: “it protects against the\nrisk that the purchaser will back out of the deal before the seller\nperforms. From the moment an advance payment is made, the\nseller is assured that, so long as it fulfills its contractual\nobligation, the money is its to keep.” Id. at 210.\n\n       Then, in the sentence that may be most applicable to the\n\n                                 8\n\fsituation before us, the Court stated, “Here, in contrast, a\ncustomer submitting a deposit [to IPL] made no commitment to\npurchase a specified quantity of electricity, or indeed to purchase\nany electricity at all.” Id. at 210-211. Because IPL’s right to\nkeep the money depended upon the customer’s purchase of\nelectricity and that customer’s decision to have the deposit\napplied to future bills, the Court noted that “IPL’s dominion over\nthe fund is far less complete than is ordinarily the case in an\nadvance-payment situation.” Id. at 211.\n\n        It is not easy to analogize the facts in Indianapolis Power\nto the facts in the case before us because the transactions and the\npositions of the parties are different. Nor is the Karns-Super\nRite transaction the same as the advance payment transaction\ndiscussed in that case. However, if the Super Rite loan and the\naccompanying Supply Agreement are considered as an advance\nrebate, the analogy becomes clearer. Super Rite provided Karns\nwith $1.5 million on condition that it purchase $16 million of\nSuper Rite products a year. When it did so, it was relieved of the\nobligation to pay Super Rite $250,000. This agreement has all\nthe indicia of an agreement to rebate $250,000 a year in advance.\nSome indication of the Court’s view of a loan transaction such as\nthe one before us can be gleaned from the Court’s distinction in\nIndianapolis Power between a loan and an advance payment\n(taxable upon receipt). After stating that the taxability of the\nreceipts must be determined by examining the relationship\nbetween the parties at the time of the deposit, the Court stated in\nthe language quoted above, “so long as the recipient fulfills the\nterms of the bargain, the money is its to keep.” Id. at 212. That\nis the key element in a transaction, such as the one before us,\nwhere the supplier gave cash in advance to a retailer in exchange\nfor a volume commitment. As long as Karns fulfilled its terms\nof the bargain, i.e., to purchase $16 million of Super Rite’s\nproduct, the money “[was] its to keep.”\n\n        That was the basis for the decision of the Tax Court in\nthis case that the funds Karns received were income, not a loan.\nIn distinguishing Indianapolis Power from this case, the Tax\nCourt noted that in Indianapolis Power the Supreme Court held\nthat IPL did not have “‘complete dominion’ over the deposits in\nquestion because it did not have ‘some guarantee’ that it would\n\n                                9\n\fbe allowed to keep them.” Karns, 90 T.C.M. at 365. The Tax\nCourt pointed out that the customers in Indianapolis Power, and\nnot IPL itself, controlled whether IPL would keep the deposits.\nThe Court contrasted that with the situation before us, stating:\n“[Karns] had ‘some guarantee’ that, for each annual period\ncovered by the April 16, 1999 supply agreement and the\ncorresponding April 15, 1999 note, it would be allowed to keep\nthe amount of the annual payment set forth in that note as long\nas, for each such period, it lived up to its end of the bargain by\nnot materially breaching the April 16, 1999 supply agreement.”\nId.\n\n        The logic of the Supreme Court’s holding in Indianapolis\nPower applies here. According to that decision, if the taxpayer\nhas some guarantee that it will be allowed to retain the funds,\nthen it has complete dominion over the money. Indianapolis\nPower, 493 U.S. at 210. Such is the case here. Karns, and Karns\nalone, was at all times in control of whether it would meet the\nSupply Agreement. Therefore, the funds provided to Karns were\nin substance a projected rebate for products to be supplied,\nanalogous to an advance payment, and as such were taxable\nincome.\n\n        Karns argues that the transaction was a loan and not an\nadvance payment because “any potential forgiveness under the\nloan was a condition subsequent.” Appellant’s Br. at 15. From\nKarns’ perspective it had an unconditional obligation to repay\nthe note; such obligation could only be expunged upon Karns’\nfulfillment of the Supply Agreement. However, this position\nexalts the form of the transaction over its substance. If Karns\nchose to meet the supply requirement, then Super Rite was\nobligated to forgive the indebtedness. Conversely, if Karns\nchose not to live up to the Supply Agreement the funds under the\nnote would become due. Therefore, Karns’ focus on the fact that\nit had an unconditional obligation to repay is misplaced. The\npoint is that it was Karns, and not Super Rite, that was in control\nover whether the obligation would be triggered.\n\n       Although the dissent recognizes that the facts in Westpac\nPacific Food v. Comm’r, 451 F.3d 970 (9th Cir. 2006), are\ndistinguishable from those before us, we must discuss that\n\n                                10\n\fcourt’s opinion because the result differs from the one that we\nreach today. Westpac, a partnership of three grocery store\nchains, entered into four contracts with four different suppliers\npromising to buy a minimum quantity of merchandise and\nreceived a volume discount in the form of cash up front. Id. at\n972. If Westpac failed to purchase the required quantity, it was\nobligated to refund the cash advance pro rata. On the other\nhand, if it purchased the required quantity, its obligation to repay\nwould be nullified. Id. The Court of Appeals held that “[c]ash\nadvances in exchange for volume purchase commitments,\nsubject to pro rata repayment if the volume commitments are not\nmet, are not income when received.” Id. at 975. The court\nreasoned that even though the recipient of a loan may have\ncomplete dominion over the funds received, such funds do not\nbecome “income” until there is an “accession to wealth.” Id.\n\n        The Westpac court realized that it had to contend with\ntwo decisions of the Supreme Court that suggested a contrary\nresult. In Automobile Club of Michigan v. Comm’r, 353 U.S.\n180 (1957), the Court held that prepaid membership dues were\nproperly characterized as income when received. The reasoning\nbehind the Supreme Court’s holding was that pro rata\napplication of the dues to each month had no bearing on the\nservices that the club had to perform when called upon.\nSimilarly, in Schlude v. Comm’r, 372 U.S. 128 (1963), the Court\nheld that cash paid to a dance studio for ballroom dancing\nlessons was income when received, not when the lessons were\nprovided. In a very brief statement constituting the totality of its\nanalysis of these cases, the court in Westpac stated that its case\n“is like Indianapolis Power, not Automobile Club of Michigan or\nSchlude.” Westpac, 431 F.3d at 976. The Westpac court ignored\nthe discussion in Indianapolis Power, quoted at length above,\nthat “so long as the recipient fulfills the terms of the bargain, the\nmoney is its to keep.” 493 U.S. at 212.\n\n       The dissenting opinion of our colleague argues that the\nSupply Agreement and the note are not “one unitary advance\nrebate,” because the Supply Agreement contained a liquidated\ndamages clause, thereby proving that the loan did not “simply\n[function] as a mechanism for quick collection of any unearned\nrebates. . . . [but rather was] a bona fide loan. ” However, the\n\n                                 11\n\fparties before us considered the Supply Agreement and the note\nto be “one unitary” device. For instance, in its brief Karns\nstates, “Super Rite agreed to loan [sic] the $1.5 million requested\nby [Karns] and [Karns] executed a Promissory Note in favor of\nSuper Rite in the amount of $1.5 million. At the same time,\n[Karns] agreed to enter into a Supply and Requirements\nAgreement.” Appellant’s Br. at 4 (emphasis added); see also\nAppellant’s Br. at 8 (“Although the [n]ote is dated April 15,\n1999 and the Supply Agreement April 16, 1999, the documents\nwere executed at the same time.”). Karns itself does not\ncharacterize the note as an independent transaction. Instead, it\nstates that “[a] default under the Supply and Requirements\nAgreement would constitute a default under the [n]ote and the\nunpaid balance would become immediately due and payable.”\nId. at 5.\n\n       The dissent attempts to avoid the effect of that analysis by\nhypothesizing situations under which Super Rite “could cancel\nthe Supply Agreement.” The dissent speculates that Super Rite\ncould cancel the Supply Agreement, and then Karns would have\nto pay. The dissent overlooks, or ignores, the provisions in the\nnote requiring Super Rite to forgive the annual payment as long\nas Karns is in material compliance with its obligation under the\nSupply Agreement. See App. at 49 (“the annual payment shall\nbe forgiven. . . .”). Thus, as we noted above, the control is in\nKarns’ hands.\n\n       We disagree with the dissent’s view that Super Rite had\n“immense latitude to cancel the Supply Agreement.” The\ndissent relies on Section 5(vi) of the Agreement in making this\npoint. However, the discretion referred to in that paragraph is\nhardly “broad.” Indeed, it is quite narrow – cancellation can\noccur only “upon the occurrence of a material adverse change in\nthe condition (financial or otherwise), business or prospects of\nthe Retailer or any guarantor of the Retailer’s liabilities and\nobligations hereunder.” App. at 52 (emphasis added). Because\nthe Agreement requires the change to be not only material, but\nalso adverse, there is little room left for Super Rite’s discretion.\n\n      In an attempt to show that Karns has no guarantee that it\nwould be able to keep the $1.5 million, the dissent points to\n\n                                 12\n\fSuper Rite’s option to terminate and calls the loan-forgiveness\nclause “illusory.” However, a termination option does not make\na promise illusory where, as here, one party “reserves the power\nto terminate for good cause or on some condition that is not\nwholly controlled by the promisor’s will.” 2 Corbin on\nContracts § 6.14, at 313–14 & n.1 (rev. ed, 2003) (citing, inter\nalia, New England Oil Corp. v. Island Oil Mktg. Corp., 288 F.\n961 (4th Cir. 1923) (seller of 2.7 million barrels of oil with\noption not to deliver if the wells produced less). Only an actual\ntermination would affect Karns’s duty under the contract. See\nU.C.C. § 2-106(3) (“‘Termination’ occurs when either party\npursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to\nthe contract otherwise than for its breach. On ‘termination’ all\nobligations which are still executory on both sides are\ndischarged . . . .”). Thus, regardless whether a termination\noption existed for Super Rite, absent the exercise of that option\nfor cause, Karns still was obligated to meet certain purchase\nminimums and Super Rite still was obligated to allow Karns to\nkeep the up-front payment if it did. In other words, “so long as\n[Karns] fulfilled the terms of the bargain, the money [was] its to\nkeep.” Indianapolis Power, 493 U.S. at 213.\n\n        The dissent conjectures that Karns might not continue to\nbe viable. There is no suggestion in the facts that this is the case.\nTo the contrary, Karns operated with the understanding that it\nwould not be required to repay any of the funds. See App. at\n135 (deposition of Scott Karns, CEO of Karns—that he\n“anticipate[d] that [he would] meet [his] purchase obligations”\nsuch that the “outstanding balance due SuperValu as a result of\nthe [money transfer] in 1999” would “be zero.”). In fact, Karns\ndid not repay the funds with the exception of the fourth year\n(after Karns and SuperValu agreed to increase the minimum\npurchase amount in 2001 by $5 million); in 2003, Karns was\nrequired to pay a pro rata portion of $4,929.19. App. at 40–41.\nSuperValu treated this as a sales rebate that Karns failed to earn\nthrough its failure to meet the minimum purchase requirements\nthat year. Id. at 40–41, 131–32. The Tax Court was dealing\nwith a real life contract in a real life situation, and it decided\naccordingly.\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we disagree with the\n\n                                 13\n\fdissent as well as with the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Westpac.2\n\n                                IV.\n\n      For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the\njudgment of the Tax Court.3\n              Karns Prime & Fancy Food, Ltd. v. Comm’r\n                                No. 06-1031\n\n\n\n           AMBRO, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n                  I join Judge Sloviter’s opinion in full. I write\n           separately to supplement, from the accounting side,\n           why I believe the result she reaches is correct and that\n           of the Ninth Circuit (and by implication, that of our\n           dissenting colleague) is unpersuasive.\n\n\n       2\n          Karns also relies on the Tax Court’s memorandum\ndecision in Erickson Post Acquisition, Inc. v. Comm’r, 86 T.C.M.\n(CCH) 111 (2003). The Government has notified us that Tax Court\nmemorandum decisions are not binding precedent in the Tax Court,\nand that it has announced its nonacquiescence in the Tax Court’s\ndecision in Erickson Post.\n       3\n          The day before this opinion was due to be filed and after\nit had cleared the full court, we received a letter from counsel in\nthis case for the Department of Justice’s Tax Division advising that\nthe Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Procedure 2007-53,\nto be effective July 23, 2007, stating that the IRS will generally\nfollow the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Westpac. The letter states\nthat “[t]he Department of Justice is presently considering whether\nto change its position in this case in light of this new Revenue\nProcedure.” Inasmuch as we have not been notified of any change\nin position by a party before us, we proceed to file this opinion.\nAny relevant matter can be raised in a petition for panel rehearing,\nwhich will allow the DOJ and the IRS to confer further about what\nposition the Government wishes to take with respect to that\npetition.\n\n                                      14\n\f                   As a preliminary comment, this case is about\n           timing. The value of money depends on when it is\n           received. Both loans and advance payments confer\n           an economic benefit on recipients because they allow\n           the recipient “both immediate use of the money (with\n           the chance to realize earnings thereon) and the\n           opportunity to make a profit by providing goods or\n           services at a cost lower than the amount of the\n           payment.” Comm’r v. Indianapolis Power & Light\n           Co., 493 U.S. 203, 207 (1990) (emphasis in original).\n           Yet, under our laws the tax consequences for these\n           two types of money transfers differ. Whereas loans\n           are not taxable upon receipt, advance payments are.\n           Id. at 208 n.3 (citations omitted); Oak Indus., Inc. v.\n           Comm’r, 96 T.C. 559, 563–64 (1991).\n\n           I.     Contrary Decisions in the Ninth Circuit\n\n                   In Westpac Pacific Food v. Comm’r, the Ninth\n           Circuit concluded that an up-front payment with a\n           conditional pro rata repayment liability was a\n           nontaxable loan. 451 F.3d 970, 975 (9th Cir. 2006).4\n           It based its decision on assertions that (1) there was\n           no absolute repayment obligation, id., and (2) “[t]here\n           was no accession to wealth when Westpac got the\n           cash . . . ,” id. at 977. The opinion for the majority\n           here has dealt with the first part of this reasoning (as\n           Karns, not Super Rite, controlled whether the\n\n\n       4\n         The Ninth Circuit reached an outcome similar to the one\nin Westpac in Milenbach v. Comm’r, 318 F.3d 924, 935–37 (9th\nCir. 2003) (concluding that $6.7 million paid by the Los Angeles\nMemorial Coliseum Commission to the Los Angeles Raiders to\ndevelop the Coliseum was a loan rather than taxable income upon\nreceipt even though the Raiders never built the Coliseum or repaid\nthe money, because the contract specified a repayment obligation\nand did not contain a loan-forgiveness clause).\n\n                                     15\n\fobligation to repay would occur); I address the second\npart.\n\n      For the Westpac Court, the case was very\n“simple,” as told through the following hypothetical:\n\n             Harry Homeowner goes\n             to the furniture store,\n             spots just the right dining\n             room chairs for $500\n             each, and says “I’ll take\n             four, if you give me a\n             discount.” Negotiating a\n             25% discount, he pays\n             only $1,500 for the chairs.\n             He has not made $500, he\n             has spent $1,500. Now\n             suppose Harry\n             Homeowner is short on\n             cash, and negotiates a\n             deal where the furniture\n             store gives him a 20%\n             discount as a cash\n             advance instead of the\n             25% off. This means the\n             store gives him $400\n             “cash back” today, and he\n             pays $2,000 for the four\n             chairs when they are\n             delivered shortly after the\n             first of the year. Harry\n             cannot go home and say\n             “I made $400 today”\n             unless he plans to skip out\n             on his obligation to pay\n             for the four chairs. Even\n             though he receives the\n\n                          16\n\f              cash, he has not made\n              money by buying the\n              chairs. He has to sell the\n              chairs for more than\n              $1,600 if he wants to\n              make money on them.\n              The reason why the $400\n              “cash back” is not income\n              is that, like a loan, the\n              money is encumbered\n              with a repayment\n              obligation to the furniture\n              store and the “cash back”\n              must be repaid if Harry\n              does not perform his\n              obligation.\n\nId. at 971–72 (emphasis added). “This case is that\nsimple,” the Court reiterated, “except that it involves\na little more math and a lot more money . . . .”\nConvinced that the agreement in that case was a\nnontaxable loan, the Westpac Court commented that\n“[i]t is hard to think of a way to make money by\nbuying things.” Id. at 971. Let’s check that out.\n\nII.    The Ninth Circuit Tax Shelter, or How to\n       Make Money By Buying Things\n\n        Consider a hypothetical involving Hal\nHomeowner, who would like to open a grocery\ndistribution center out of his garage. Hal goes to the\nsupermarket and, like Harry, is short on cash. Also\nconsider what happens when Hal Homeowner files\nhis taxes, which makes any simple hypothetical more\ncomplex. We will suppose that Hal makes a 100%\nprofit on the value of each carton, meaning that for\nevery $2,000 worth of food he buys he resells for\n\n                           17\n\f$4,000. We will also assume a typical corporate tax\nrate of 34% (which the Government applied to Karns)\napplies here.\n\n             Scenario 1\n\n             Hal Homeowner walks\n             into a supermarket and\n             eyes cartons of food for\n             $400 each that would be\n             ideal for his garage mini-\n             mart. The store owner\n             sees what Hal\n             Homeowner has in mind,\n             and when it becomes clear\n             that Hal has no money but\n             a lot of potential, the\n             owner puts this offer on\n             the table: “I will give you\n             20% off now if you agree\n             to buy five cartons\n             ($2,000 worth of food)\n             each year for the next six\n             years.” Under this\n             scheme, Hal pays each\n             year just $1,600 for five\n             cartons. This is an\n             example of a “volume\n             supply discount” similar\n             to the one that Harry\n             Homeowner negotiated;\n             Hal has gotten a 20%-off\n             deal, except there is no\n             cash advance involved\n             here, which makes the tax\n             calculation\n             straightforward. Each\n\n                          18\n\fyear, Hal simply pays\n$1,600 for $2,000 worth\nof goods. He deducts that\n$1,600 in business\nexpenses and reports\n$4,000 in resale to yield a\ntaxable income of $2,400,\nwhich carries a tax\nliability of $816 per year.\n\nScenario 2\n\nNow suppose the store\nowner proposes this: “I\nwill give you $400 now if\nyou buy $2,000 worth of\nfood each year for the\nnext six years. This will\nget you started with your\nbusiness, and you can just\npay me back the $400 at\nthe end of the year from\nyour resale proceeds.”\nHal cannot go home and\nsay “I made $400 today,”\nbecause he has an\nunconditional obligation\nto repay the $400 loan at\nthe end of the year. At\nthe end of the first year,\nHal duly pays back the\nloan, and on his tax forms\nhe simply deducts $2,000\nas business expenses from\nhis total resale proceeds\nof $4,000 to yield a\ntaxable income of $2,000,\n\n             19\n\f             which carries a tax\n             liability of $680 each\n             year. This is $136 per\n             year less than the tax\n             liability in Scenario 1,\n             which makes sense\n             because Hal makes $400\n             less each year.\n\n        The reason that the $400 was not income is\nthat it was subject to an unconditional repayment\nobligation, notwithstanding whether Hal performed\non his contract by meeting minimum purchase\nrequirements. In other words, it was a bona fide loan.\n\n             Scenario 3\n\n             Suppose the store owner\n             proposes this: “I’ll give\n             you $400 now if you\n             agree to buy five cartons\n             ($2,000 worth of food)\n             each year for the next six\n             years. If you can manage\n             that, you don’t have to\n             worry about paying me\n             back at the end of the\n             year.” This seems like\n             quite a deal to Hal, who\n             readily agrees. At the end\n             of the first year, Hal\n             deducts on his tax returns\n             $1,600 in business\n             expenses ($2,000 for the\n             food minus $400 “cash\n             back” off the full\n             purchase price given in\n\n                          20\n\f              exchange for the purchase\n              commitment), and reports\n              $4,000 in resale proceeds\n              to yield a gross income of\n              $2,400, which carries a\n              tax liability of $816. This\n              is the same as the tax\n              liability in Scenario 1, for\n              Hal has made the same\n              amount. In subsequent\n              years, Hal deducts $2,000\n              in business expenses and\n              reports $4,000 in resale\n              proceeds to yield a gross\n              income of $2,000 each\n              year, which carries an\n              annual tax liability of\n              $680.\n\n       When he first made the deal, Hal could go\nhome and say, “I made $400 today,” because he did\nnot plan to skip out on his obligation to buy five\ncartons each year, was confident that he would resell\nthe goods for profit, and thus had some assurance that\nhe could keep his money and make back the rest from\nthe proceeds of his resale. With this understanding,\nthe $400 given to him at the outset was an advance\npayment that was taxable income when received.\n\n       So far, there is little cause for controversy over\nhow Hal has done his taxes. He reported his profits\nas gross income in Scenario 1 (the volume supply\ndiscount without a cash advance); he repaid his loan\nand then reported his profits as gross income in\nScenario 2 (the loan); and he reported his profits,\nalong with the amount of cash he received up front, as\ngross income in Scenario 3 (the advance payment).\n\n                           21\n\fWhat happens if Hal wants to do his taxes a little\ndifferently in Scenario 3 in order to save some\nmoney?\n\n              Scenario 4\n\n              The facts are the same as\n              Scenario 3, but Hal does\n              his tax reporting\n              differently. Instead of\n              deducting $1,600 in the\n              first year, Hal deducts\n              $2,000 in business\n              expenses and reports\n              resale proceeds of $4,000\n              to yield a gross income of\n              $2,000 in the first year,\n              which carries a $680 tax\n              liability. Hal plans on\n              waiting until the end of\n              his six-year term to pay\n              tax on the $400 as “other\n              income” (i.e., “loan”\n              forgiveness). He has\n              realized a $136 tax\n              savings (the difference\n              between $816 due on\n              $2,400 in Scenario 3 and\n              $680 due on $2,000 in\n              this scenario).\n\n       By deferring the taxes due on the $400, Hal is\nable to take advantage now of $2,400 (the up-front\ncash plus the $2,000 he makes in profits) without\npaying taxes on that full amount. Put differently, this\nmeans that he is able to take advantage of a $136 tax\nsavings in the first year. If he pays taxes on the $400\n\n                           22\n\f           as income in the year of receipt (as in Scenario 3), the\n           present value of his tax liability over the course of the\n           six-year deal is $3,368.35.5 But if Hal defers payment\n           of taxes on the $400 until the end of Year 6 (as in\n           Scenario 4), the present value of his tax liability will\n           be only $3,331.87 over this same period. The present\n           value of his total tax savings is a difference of $36.48\n           ($3,368.35 in Scenario 3 minus $3,331.87 in Scenario\n           4), which is negligible when dealing in amounts so\n           small. But the amount grows when dealing in\n           millions.\n\n                  In Karns’s case, the deferral of the tax\n           payment resulted in a savings of about $500,000 by\n           Year 6—the same amount that the Government\n           argues is owed in back taxes. This sort of difference\n           demonstrates how advance payments confer an\n           economic benefit. As noted, they allow the recipient\n\n\n       5\n         The present value of money (at some future time) is\ncalculated by dividing the monetary amount (here: $816 in taxes on\na $2,400 income) by the following: the product of the number of\nyears (here: 1) and the discount rate (assumed: 7%) raised to the\npower of the number of years (here: 1).\n       Thus, the present value of an $816 tax liability for Year 1 at\nthe end of the first year at a 7% rate is $762.62; the present values\nof a $680 tax liability for Years 2–6 are $593.94 at the end of the\nsecond year, $555.08 at the end of the third year, $518.77 at the\nend of the fourth year, $484.83 at the end of the fifth year, and\n$453.11 at the end of the sixth year. Added together, this yields a\nsum of $3,368.35.\n       By contrast, the present value of an $816 tax liability for\nYear 1 at the end of the sixth year at a 7% rate is $543.74; the\npresent values of a $680 tax liability for Years 1–5 are $635.51 at\nthe end of the first year, plus—as before—$593.94 at the end of the\nsecond year, $555.08 at the end of the third year, $518.77 at the\nend of the fourth year, and $484.83 at the end of the fifth year.\nAdded together, this yields a sum of $3,331.87.\n\n                                       23\n\f“immediate use of the money [or savings] . . . and the\nopportunity to make a profit by providing goods or\nservices at a cost lower than the amount of the\npayment.” Indianapolis Power, 493 U.S. at 208\n(emphasis in original). For in Scenario 4 Hal’s\nbusiness expenses actually are only $1,600 ($2,000\nminus the $400 advance), and by reporting his\nexpenses as $2,000, he inflates his business\ndeductions. He has gained immediate use of the up-\nfront money and is able to profit by providing goods\nat a cost lower than the amount of the payment,\nresulting in a $136 tax savings in the first year. The\narrangement in this case is similar. The lesson: when\ntaxes on funds advanced in Year 1 are deferred and\ngoods purchased in Year 1 are resold for profit,\nmoney indeed can be made by buying things.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n        At first blush, both tax payment schemes—pay\nnow or pay later—may appear to be merely alternate\nways of doing the math, because Hal Homeowner and\nKarns will eventually pay taxes on the up-front\nmoney. But we cannot view the “pay later” method\nas just another way of calculating taxes, because our\nlaws require otherwise. First, Karns avails itself of an\neconomic benefit through this method, which\nfunctions like a tax-deferral shelter that the Code has\nnot authorized. Second, Karns’s attempt to consider\nas a loan money that it will never have to repay\ncontravenes the requirement that “an accrual-basis\ntaxpayer [which Karns is] . . . [must] treat advance\npayments as income in the year of receipt.”\nIndianapolis Power, 493 U.S. at 207 n.3 (citations\nomitted).\n\n       In sum, I am not persuaded by the analysis in\n\n                          24\n\fthe Ninth Circuit. It is the first and only Court of\nAppeals to conclude that trade discounts paid by the\nsupplier to a taxpayer to offset the taxpayer’s required\nminimum purchases are loans rather than advance\npayments. Its conclusion contradicts our own\nemphasis (both before and after Indianapolis Power)\nthat income may be considered to be a “loan” only\nwhen there is an unconditional repayment obligation.\nSee, e.g., Geftman v. Comm’r, 154 F.3d 61, 68 (3d\nCir. 1998); Diamond Bros. v. Comm’r, 322 F.2d 725,\n731 (3d Cir. 1963).\n\n        To reiterate, when understood this way, our\ncase is about timing. Funds received with no\nunconditional repayment obligation result in one set\nof profit margins and tax liabilities, and deferred tax\npayment on those same funds results in another set.\nFor practical and policy reasons, our Tax Code and\nmost decisions interpreting it require taxpayers to pay\ntaxes for the year of receipt on funds advanced to\nthem by suppliers when any purported repayment\nobligation is conditional on acts controlled by\ntaxpayers—i.e., when there is no unconditional\nrepayment obligation. Because there was no\nunconditional obligation to repay the money here, I\nbelieve that the $1.5 million received up front by\nKarns was an advance payment, taxable upon receipt.\nI therefore concur in affirming the Tax Court’s\nassessment of taxes owed.\n\n\n\n\n                          25\n\f                   Karns v. C.I.R.\n\n                       Dissent\n\n\n\n\nBRODY, District Judge\n\n\n\n\n       Because the agreements between Super Rite\nand Karns provided no guarantee that Super Rite\nwould allow Karns to keep the money it received as a\nloan from Super Rite, I respectfully dissent from the\nmajority’s conclusion that the loan was taxable\nincome in the year it was received.\n\n\n\n\n       According to the majority, the agreement\nbetween retailer Karns and supplier Super Rite is\nfunctionally a single advance rebate formally divided\ninto two parts: a loan with a multi-year repayment\nperiod; and a multi-year Supply Agreement. Super\nRite would pay the advance rebate in the form of a\nloan, and would forgive the loan in annual\ninstallments as long as Karns annually bought the\nrequisite amount of product under the Supply\nAgreement. The majority concludes that the money\nwas taxable when received because Karns was never\nobligated to repay the loan and always had control\nover whether it would keep the money. That Karns\nmight not be able to meet its obligations in the Supply\nAgreement is of no moment to the majority, which\nviews Karns’ ability to perform its contractual\nobligations as under Karns’ “control” for tax law\npurposes.\n\n                          26\n\f                  As the majority recognizes, this decision holds\n          that all advance trade rebates are taxable in the year\n          received, in direct opposition to the Ninth Circuit’s\n          opinion in Westpac Pacific Food v. C.I.R., 451 F.3d\n          970 (2006) (Kleinfeld, J.) I would not reach that\n          broader question because the facts of Westpac are\n          distinguishable: in this case, the transactions gave the\n          taxpayer less control over the money than in the pure\n          advance rebate in Westpac. In Westpac, the retailer\n          was guaranteed to be able to keep the funds upon\n          completion of its purchase obligations. But here, the\n          loan provided no advance guarantee of forgiveness\n          even if Karns made every effort to complete the\n          purchases required by the Supply Agreement.6\n\n\n\n\n                 It is true that Karns’ annual loan payment\n          would be forgiven as long as Karns was “in\n          compliance” with the Supply Agreement for the year,\n          and that the two transactions are linked. App. at 49\n          (“Promissory Note”). But Super Rite (in its role as\n          supplier) had immense latitude to cancel the Supply\n          Agreement. Under Section 5(vi) of the Supply\n          Agreement, Super Rite could cancel the agreement\n\n\n\n\n                 Immediately upon the occurrence of a material\n                 adverse change in the condition (financial or\n                 otherwise), business or prospects of the\n                 Retailer or any guarantor of the Retailer’s\n                 liabilities and obligations hereunder.\n\n\n      6\n        I also disagree with the majority – Westpac was correctly\ndecided. Advance rebates should be considered income only when\nthey are actually earned through completed purchases.\n\n                                     27\n\f           App. at 52 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                   This broad discretion to cancel the Supply\n           Agreement for almost any kind of change in Karns or\n           its guarantors’ “condition” renders nigh illusory any\n           control Karns might have had over the continued\n           existence of the Supply Agreement.7 If Super Rite\n           cancelled the Supply Agreement, Karns would be\n           required to repay the loan. Karns, then, had little\n           meaningful control or “guarantee” that its loan would\n           be forgiven at the time it received the loan. Karns’\n           actions (meeting the Supply Agreement’s purchase\n           amount requirements) would have some role in\n           determining whether the loan would be forgiven. But\n           rather than being under Karns’ exclusive control,\n           forgiveness was ultimately subject to lender Super\n           Rite’s discretion over the Supply Agreement. As\n           such, it cannot be said that Karns had a “guarantee”\n           that it would be able to keep the money. See Comm’r\n           v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 4893 U.S. 203,\n           210 (1990) (“In determining whether [money is\n           taxable income when received], the crucial point is . .\n           . whether the taxpayer has some guarantee that he will\n           be allowed to keep the money.”)\n\n\n\n\n                  The Supply Agreement also contained a\n\n\n       7\n          This is not to say that the Supply Agreement is\nunenforceable as a matter of contract law – this is a federal law tax\ncase, not a state law contract case. The degree of control Karns\nhad over the continued existence of the Supply Agreement is\nrelevant here only to show that Karns had no meaningful\n“guarantee” that the Supply Agreement would continue.\n\n                                       28\n\fliquidated damages clause:\n\n\n\n\n       [T]he parties agree that upon Super Rite’s\n       cancellation of this agreement pursuant to\n       Sections 2 or 5 of this Agreement, the Retailer\n       will pay Super Rite as liquidated damages an\n       amount equal to 1.0% of the product of (i) the\n       Retailer’s aggregate purchases from Super Rite\n       during the preceding calendar year multiplied\n       by (ii) the number of years remaining in the\n       term of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nApp. at 53 (Section 7 of Supply Agreement). That a\nremedy for breach of the Supply Agreement is\ncontained within the Supply Agreement itself belies\nthe view that the loan and the Supply Agreement\nwere one unitary advance rebate, with the loan simply\nfunctioning as a mechanism for quick collection of\nany unearned rebates. Instead, the loan was an\nindependent transaction with all the characteristics of\na bona fide loan.\n\n\n\n\n       The retail grocery business is a low-margin,\ncash-intensive endeavor. See Supermarket News 9,\nCredit Crunch (July 30, 2001), 2001 WLNR\n9062811; National Governors Association Center for\nBest Practices, Case Study: Pennsylvania’s Fresh\nFood Financing Initiative (noting that “[a]s\ncommunities become less dense, it is harder for\n\n\n\n\n                          29\n\f         grocery stores to remain viable.”).8 As such, access to\n         credit is extremely important to retailers like Karns,\n         and it makes sense that suppliers might step in to\n         provide that credit. That Super Rite served dual\n         functions of supplier and creditor does not mean that\n         in this case, the loan was not a loan.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n         A v a i l a b l e          o n l i n e      a t\nhttp://www.nga.org/Files/pdf/0510ACTIVELIVINGPA.PDF.\n\n                                   30\n\f",

Instead, the issue is to be determined\nafter an examination of “all the facts and circumstances.”\nComm’r v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112347\"><a href=\"/opinion/112347/commissioner-v-indianapolis-power-light-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207\n(1990) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The\napplicable law is not uncertain. It is “settled that receipt of a\nloan is not income to the borrower.” Id. On the other hand,\nfunds received “are taxable as income upon receipt if they\nconstitute advance payments . . . .” Id. The courts’\ndeterminations as to which side of the line a particular payment\nfalls have not always been consistent. In the appeal before us we\nmust decide whether the Tax Court erred in characterizing the\npayment received by appellant as income, for which it had been\nissued a notice of deficiency.\n\n                                I.\n\n       Appellant Karns Prime & Fancy Food, Ltd., is a\nPennsylvania corporation that operates grocery stores in the\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania area. During the taxable year ended\nJanuary 30, 2000, Karns operated five grocery stores in\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania. Karns’ principal supplier was Super\nRite Foods, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Rich Foods, Inc.\nKarns’ CEO, Scott Karns, prepared a capital budget in 1998 and\ndetermined that Karns required $1.5 million for capital\n\n                                2\n\fimprovements in the coming years. Karns approached Dale\nConklin, President of Super Rite, about borrowing funds from\nSuper Rite. Super Rite did not generally make loans to its\ncustomers, but would, from time to time, make funds available to\n“certain of its creditworthy and strategically important\ncustomers.” Appellant’s Br. at 3. Due to Karns’ loan\nobligations with its primary lender – PNC Bank – Karns\nrequested and obtained a waiver from PNC in order to secure the\nfunds that Super Rite was willing to provide.\n\n       Super Rite requires customers to whom it provides\nfinancial assistance to enter into a Supply and Requirements\nAgreement (“Supply Agreement”) whereby the customer, in this\ncase Karns, agrees to purchase a minimum dollar amount of\nproducts from Super Rite. Super Rite also requires the customer\nto execute a promissory note payable to Super Rite in the\namount of the funds it provided. Thus, Super Rite agreed to\nmake $1.5 million immediately available to Karns and Karns\nexecuted a promissory note to Super Rite on April 15, 1999.\nKarns signed the Supply Agreement on April 16, 1999.1\n\n       Pursuant to that agreement, Karns agreed to repay the\nnote in six annual payments of $250,000. Significantly, the\nagreement provided that if Karns met the supply requirement for\nthe previous calendar year at issue by purchasing the stipulated\namount of Super Rite products, the $250,000 due and owing for\nthat year would be forgiven. Karns received the $1.5 million on\nMay 4, 1999. Karns recorded the note on its books as a long-\nterm note payable. Super Rite recorded the note as an asset and\namortized the note monthly over the six-year period.\n\n       A. The Supply and Requirements Agreement\n\n\n\n       1\n         Although there is apparently an inconsistency in the record\nas to the specific dates of the note and supply agreement, the Tax\nCourt stated that it is clear from the record that they “were entered\ninto around the same time and were interdependent.” Karns Prime\n& Fancy Food, Ltd. v. Comm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 360 n.9\n(2005).\n\n                                 3\n\f        The Supply Agreement provided that Super Rite would be\nthe principal wholesaler for all of Karns’ purchased products in\nthe Harrisburg geographical area. Karns agreed to purchase $16\nmillion worth of product annually from Super Rite. In addition,\nKarns agreed to Super Rite’s general policies and practices in\neffect, with respect to, for instance, product pricing (Karns paid\na 2.5% markup for grocery products, 3% for dairy products, and\n3.5% for frozen products), billing and payment terms, and\nreturns and credits for purchased products. Under the terms of\nthe Agreement, Karns was given seven days to make payment\nfor its product purchases. Failure to do so constituted default,\nand Super Rite had the right to suspend shipments during the\nterm of default. Any default under the Supply Agreement also\nconstituted a default under the note, thus requiring the balance\nunder the note to become due immediately.\n\n        Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Super Rite\ncould cancel the Agreement if Karns filed for bankruptcy, failed\nto pay in accordance with the agreement, or was in default of\nany “material contract, instrument or agreement, including,\nwithout limitation, any lease of real property, any material lease\nof personal property or any promissory note, instrument or\nagreement evidencing or in respect of any indebtedness for\nborrowed money or any security therefor . . . .” App. at 52.\nKarns had the right to cancel the Agreement in the event that\nSuper Rite filed for bankruptcy protection. Karns granted Super\nRite a security interest in its assets, including inventory,\naccounts, equipment, and proceeds. Karns agreed to make its\ninternal financial statements available within ninety days of each\nfiscal quarter and a financial statement prepared by its\nindependent accountant every six months. Finally, Karns gave\nSuper Rite a right of first refusal if Karns’ shareholders sold\neither the corporation or its assets to a third party.\n\n       B. The Note\n\n       The promissory note had a face value of $1.5 million.\nInterest on the unpaid balance was to be paid at prime plus 1%.\nThe note was to be repaid in six annual payments of $250,000\ncommencing April 16, 2000 and continuing on the third Friday\nof each April thereafter up to and including April 16, 2005. The\n\n                                4\n\fnote also provided the following:\n\n      payment of the annual payment shall be forgiven by the\n      Lender if the Lender determines that Borrower is in\n      compliance with, and shall not have materially breached\n      or then be in uncured default under, that certain Supply\n      and Requirements Agreement of even date herewith\n      among the Borrower and Lender. The entire unpaid and\n      unforgiven principal balance hereof shall be due and\n      payable, if prior to April 16, 2005, Borrower ceases, for\n      any reason, to use Lender as its primary food supplier.\n\nApp. at 49 (emphasis added).\n\n      Karns spent $750,000 of the $1.5 million received from\nSuper Rite on capital improvements and temporarily invested the\nbalance in certificates of deposit. The CDs were then pledged to\nPNC as collateral for a new $960,000 loan from PNC. That\n$960,000 was in turn invested in further capital improvements.\n\n        In August 1999, SuperValu, Inc. acquired Rich Foods\n(parent of Super Rite). Soon thereafter, Karns decided to\nrelocate one of its stores. In order to satisfy the new lessor’s\nconcerns, Karns requested that SuperValu guarantee its new\nlease. On or about January 25, 2000, SuperValu agreed to\nguarantee Karns’ lease; in return the parties amended the April\n16, 1999 Supply Agreement to reflect the guarantee and Karns\nentered into several agreements with SuperValu, including, inter\nalia, an agreement that granted SuperValu a security interest in\nsome of Karns’ assets.\n\n        Karns satisfied the Supply Agreement for the periods\nending April 16, 2000 and April 16, 2001, “and otherwise\ncomplied with, did not materially breach, and was not in uncured\ndefault under that . . . agreement.” Karns Prime & Fancy Food,\nLtd. v.

Because\nKarns fulfilled the purchase requirements and the other\ncovenants, the required annual payments of $250,000 on the\npromissory note were forgiven. In its January 30, 2001, and\nJanuary 30, 2002, tax returns Karns reported the debt\nforgiveness of $250,000 as “Other Income – Reduction of\n\n                               5\n\fSupplier Note Agreement.” App. at 39.\n\n       In 2001, Karns sought an additional $300,000 from\nSuperValu in order to facilitate a move to a new location vacated\nby Fleming Foods, a food wholesaler who declared bankruptcy.\nKarns needed the funds to buy out the remainder of its existing\nlease and to purchase inventory and fixtures at the new location.\nSuperValu agreed, and Karns executed a promissory note to\nSuperValu on March 9, 2001 in the amount of $300,000 with\ninterest at 10.7% per year. Karns executed new agreements,\nincluding a second amendment to the Supply Agreement, which\nincreased the annual purchase requirements from Super Rite\nfrom $16 to $21 million. The note called for debt service\npayments to be made annually from March 9, 2002 through\nMarch 9, 2005, but the new Supply Agreement did not extend\nthe term of the original Supply Agreement beyond April 16,\n2005.\n\n       Karns met the purchase requirement of $21 million for the\nperiod ending March 9, 2002, and therefore did not pay the\n$250,000 due annually under the note. For the period ended\nMarch 9, 2003, Karns purchased only $19.8 million from\nSuperValu, and it had to pay $4,929.19 toward the annual\npayment due under the March 9, 2001 note.\n\n                               II.\n\n       The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service\nmailed a notice of deficiency to Karns for its federal income tax\nyear ending January 30, 2000, in the amount of $486,355 on\nOctober 24, 2003. The basis for the claimed deficiency was\nKarns’ failure to include the $1.5 million payment from Super\nRite as income in its tax return. Karns timely petitioned the Tax\nCourt for a redetermination of the tax deficiency. The Tax Court\nhad jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §§ 6213(a), 6214, and\n7442. After a trial, the Court entered its decision on October 5,\n2005, holding that the $1.5 million payment to Karns was not a\nloan and thus was includable in Karns’ gross income. Karns, 80\nT.C.M. at 365. Karns filed a timely notice of appeal to this\ncourt.

Although IPL commingled the funds received\nwith other receipts and did not segregate them, it did not treat the\ndeposits as income on its books but instead carried them as\ncurrent liabilities. Id. at 205. The Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”) had a different view of the transactions. It viewed the\ndeposits as advance payments for electricity and assessed\ndeficiencies on the ground that the deposits were gross income,\ntaxable to IPL upon receipt. Id. at 204. The Tax Court\ndisagreed with the IRS. Id. at 206. It held that the principal\n\n                                 7\n\fpurpose of the deposits was to serve as security rather than as\nprepayment of income. Id.

In the course of its opinion, the Court\nprovided guidance as to the distinction for taxation purposes\nbetween an advance payment and a loan. The Court stated, “[i]n\neconomic terms, . . . the distinction between a loan and an\nadvance payment is one of degree rather than of kind.”\nIndianapolis Power, 493 U.S. at 208. It explained, “[t]he issue\nturns upon the nature of the rights and obligations that [are]\nassumed” when the transaction occurs. Id. at 209.\n\n       The Court held that the advance deposits were not income\nto IPL when received, stating that “such dominion as IPL has\nover these customer deposits is insufficient for the deposits to\nqualify as taxable income at the time they are made.” Id. at 214.\nIn holding that the deposits were not the economic equivalent of\nadvance payments, the court noted that the customers who made\nthe deposits “retain[ed] the right to insist upon repayment in\ncash,” whereas the “individual who makes an advance payment\nretains no right to insist upon return of the funds; so long as the\nrecipient fulfills the terms of the bargain, the money is its to\nkeep.” Id. at 213.\n\n        In rejecting the IRS’s attempt to analogize the IPL\ncustomers’ security deposits to advance payments, the Court\nstated that although there was some similarity in that “[a]n\nadvance payment, like the deposits at issue here, concededly\nprotects the seller against the risk that it would be unable to\ncollect money owed it after it has furnished goods or services,”\nan advance payment does much more: “it protects against the\nrisk that the purchaser will back out of the deal before the seller\nperforms. From the moment an advance payment is made, the\nseller is assured that, so long as it fulfills its contractual\nobligation, the money is its to keep.” Id. at 210.\n\n       Then, in the sentence that may be most applicable to the\n\n                                 8\n\fsituation before us, the Court stated, “Here, in contrast, a\ncustomer submitting a deposit [to IPL] made no commitment to\npurchase a specified quantity of electricity, or indeed to purchase\nany electricity at all.” Id. at 210-211. Because IPL’s right to\nkeep the money depended upon the customer’s purchase of\nelectricity and that customer’s decision to have the deposit\napplied to future bills, the Court noted that “IPL’s dominion over\nthe fund is far less complete than is ordinarily the case in an\nadvance-payment situation.” Id. at 211.\n\n        It is not easy to analogize the facts in Indianapolis Power\nto the facts in the case before us because the transactions and the\npositions of the parties are different. Nor is the Karns-Super\nRite transaction the same as the advance payment transaction\ndiscussed in that case. However, if the Super Rite loan and the\naccompanying Supply Agreement are considered as an advance\nrebate, the analogy becomes clearer. Super Rite provided Karns\nwith $1.5 million on condition that it purchase $16 million of\nSuper Rite products a year. When it did so, it was relieved of the\nobligation to pay Super Rite $250,000. This agreement has all\nthe indicia of an agreement to rebate $250,000 a year in advance.\nSome indication of the Court’s view of a loan transaction such as\nthe one before us can be gleaned from the Court’s distinction in\nIndianapolis Power between a loan and an advance payment\n(taxable upon receipt). After stating that the taxability of the\nreceipts must be determined by examining the relationship\nbetween the parties at the time of the deposit, the Court stated in\nthe language quoted above, “so long as the recipient fulfills the\nterms of the bargain, the money is its to keep.” Id. at 212. That\nis the key element in a transaction, such as the one before us,\nwhere the supplier gave cash in advance to a retailer in exchange\nfor a volume commitment. As long as Karns fulfilled its terms\nof the bargain, i.e., to purchase $16 million of Super Rite’s\nproduct, the money “[was] its to keep.”\n\n        That was the basis for the decision of the Tax Court in\nthis case that the funds Karns received were income, not a loan.\nIn distinguishing Indianapolis Power from this case, the Tax\nCourt noted that in Indianapolis Power the Supreme Court held\nthat IPL did not have “‘complete dominion’ over the deposits in\nquestion because it did not have ‘some guarantee’ that it would\n\n                                9\n\fbe allowed to keep them.” Karns, 90 T.C.M. at 365. The Tax\nCourt pointed out that the customers in Indianapolis Power, and\nnot IPL itself, controlled whether IPL would keep the deposits.\nThe Court contrasted that with the situation before us, stating:\n“[Karns] had ‘some guarantee’ that, for each annual period\ncovered by the April 16, 1999 supply agreement and the\ncorresponding April 15, 1999 note, it would be allowed to keep\nthe amount of the annual payment set forth in that note as long\nas, for each such period, it lived up to its end of the bargain by\nnot materially breaching the April 16, 1999 supply agreement.”\nId.\n\n        The logic of the Supreme Court’s holding in Indianapolis\nPower applies here. According to that decision, if the taxpayer\nhas some guarantee that it will be allowed to retain the funds,\nthen it has complete dominion over the money. Indianapolis\nPower, 493 U.S. at 210. Such is the case here. Karns, and Karns\nalone, was at all times in control of whether it would meet the\nSupply Agreement. Therefore, the funds provided to Karns were\nin substance a projected rebate for products to be supplied,\nanalogous to an advance payment, and as such were taxable\nincome.\n\n        Karns argues that the transaction was a loan and not an\nadvance payment because “any potential forgiveness under the\nloan was a condition subsequent.” Appellant’s Br. at 15. From\nKarns’ perspective it had an unconditional obligation to repay\nthe note; such obligation could only be expunged upon Karns’\nfulfillment of the Supply Agreement. However, this position\nexalts the form of the transaction over its substance. If Karns\nchose to meet the supply requirement, then Super Rite was\nobligated to forgive the indebtedness. Conversely, if Karns\nchose not to live up to the Supply Agreement the funds under the\nnote would become due. Therefore, Karns’ focus on the fact that\nit had an unconditional obligation to repay is misplaced. The\npoint is that it was Karns, and not Super Rite, that was in control\nover whether the obligation would be triggered.\n\n       Although the dissent recognizes that the facts in Westpac\nPacific Food v. Comm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794699\"><a href=\"/opinion/794699/westpac-pacific-food-save-mart-supermarkets-inc-tax-matters-partner-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2006), are\ndistinguishable from those before us, we must discuss that\n\n                                10\n\fcourt’s opinion because the result differs from the one that we\nreach today. Westpac, a partnership of three grocery store\nchains, entered into four contracts with four different suppliers\npromising to buy a minimum quantity of merchandise and\nreceived a volume discount in the form of cash up front. Id. at\n972. If Westpac failed to purchase the required quantity, it was\nobligated to refund the cash advance pro rata. On the other\nhand, if it purchased the required quantity, its obligation to repay\nwould be nullified. Id. The Court of Appeals held that “[c]ash\nadvances in exchange for volume purchase commitments,\nsubject to pro rata repayment if the volume commitments are not\nmet, are not income when received.” Id. at 975. The court\nreasoned that even though the recipient of a loan may have\ncomplete dominion over the funds received, such funds do not\nbecome “income” until there is an “accession to wealth.” Id.\n\n        The Westpac court realized that it had to contend with\ntwo decisions of the Supreme Court that suggested a contrary\nresult. In Automobile Club of Michigan v. Comm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105492\"><a href=\"/opinion/105492/automobile-club-of-mich-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1957), the Court held that prepaid membership dues were\nproperly characterized as income when received. The reasoning\nbehind the Supreme Court’s holding was that pro rata\napplication of the dues to each month had no bearing on the\nservices that the club had to perform when called upon.\nSimilarly, in Schlude v. Comm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106533\"><a href=\"/opinion/106533/schulde-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963), the Court\nheld that cash paid to a dance studio for ballroom dancing\nlessons was income when received, not when the lessons were\nprovided. In a very brief statement constituting the totality of its\nanalysis of these cases, the court in Westpac stated that its case\n“is like Indianapolis Power, not Automobile Club of Michigan or\nSchlude.” Westpac, 431 F.3d at 976. The Westpac court ignored\nthe discussion in Indianapolis Power, quoted at length above,\nthat “so long as the recipient fulfills the terms of the bargain, the\nmoney is its to keep.” 493 U.S. at 212.\n\n       The dissenting opinion of our colleague argues that the\nSupply Agreement and the note are not “one unitary advance\nrebate,” because the Supply Agreement contained a liquidated\ndamages clause, thereby proving that the loan did not “simply\n[function] as a mechanism for quick collection of any unearned\nrebates. . . . [but rather was] a bona fide loan. ” However, the\n\n                                 11\n\fparties before us considered the Supply Agreement and the note\nto be “one unitary” device. For instance, in its brief Karns\nstates, “Super Rite agreed to loan [sic] the $1.5 million requested\nby [Karns] and [Karns] executed a Promissory Note in favor of\nSuper Rite in the amount of $1.5 million. At the same time,\n[Karns] agreed to enter into a Supply and Requirements\nAgreement.” Appellant’s Br. at 4 (emphasis added); see also\nAppellant’s Br. at 8 (“Although the [n]ote is dated April 15,\n1999 and the Supply Agreement April 16, 1999, the documents\nwere executed at the same time.”). Karns itself does not\ncharacterize the note as an independent transaction. Instead, it\nstates that “[a] default under the Supply and Requirements\nAgreement would constitute a default under the [n]ote and the\nunpaid balance would become immediately due and payable.”\nId. at 5.\n\n       The dissent attempts to avoid the effect of that analysis by\nhypothesizing situations under which Super Rite “could cancel\nthe Supply Agreement.” The dissent speculates that Super Rite\ncould cancel the Supply Agreement, and then Karns would have\nto pay. The dissent overlooks, or ignores, the provisions in the\nnote requiring Super Rite to forgive the annual payment as long\nas Karns is in material compliance with its obligation under the\nSupply Agreement. See App. at 49 (“the annual payment shall\nbe forgiven. . . .”). Thus, as we noted above, the control is in\nKarns’ hands.\n\n       We disagree with the dissent’s view that Super Rite had\n“immense latitude to cancel the Supply Agreement.” The\ndissent relies on Section 5(vi) of the Agreement in making this\npoint. However, the discretion referred to in that paragraph is\nhardly “broad.” Indeed, it is quite narrow – cancellation can\noccur only “upon the occurrence of a material adverse change in\nthe condition (financial or otherwise), business or prospects of\nthe Retailer or any guarantor of the Retailer’s liabilities and\nobligations hereunder.” App. at 52 (emphasis added). Because\nthe Agreement requires the change to be not only material, but\nalso adverse, there is little room left for Super Rite’s discretion.\n\n      In an attempt to show that Karns has no guarantee that it\nwould be able to keep the $1.5 million, the dissent points to\n\n                                 12\n\fSuper Rite’s option to terminate and calls the loan-forgiveness\nclause “illusory.” However, a termination option does not make\na promise illusory where, as here, one party “reserves the power\nto terminate for good cause or on some condition that is not\nwholly controlled by the promisor’s will.” 2 Corbin on\nContracts § 6.14, at 313–14 & n.1 (rev. ed, 2003) (citing, inter\nalia, New England Oil Corp. v. Island Oil Mktg. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">961</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1923) (seller of 2.7 million barrels of oil with\noption not to deliver if the wells produced less). Only an actual\ntermination would affect Karns’s duty under the contract. See\nU.C.C. § 2-106(3) (“‘Termination’ occurs when either party\npursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to\nthe contract otherwise than for its breach. On ‘termination’ all\nobligations which are still executory on both sides are\ndischarged . . . .”). Thus, regardless whether a termination\noption existed for Super Rite, absent the exercise of that option\nfor cause, Karns still was obligated to meet certain purchase\nminimums and Super Rite still was obligated to allow Karns to\nkeep the up-front payment if it did. In other words, “so long as\n[Karns] fulfilled the terms of the bargain, the money [was] its to\nkeep.” Indianapolis Power, 493 U.S. at 213.\n\n        The dissent conjectures that Karns might not continue to\nbe viable. There is no suggestion in the facts that this is the case.\nTo the contrary, Karns operated with the understanding that it\nwould not be required to repay any of the funds. See App. at\n135 (deposition of Scott Karns, CEO of Karns—that he\n“anticipate[d] that [he would] meet [his] purchase obligations”\nsuch that the “outstanding balance due SuperValu as a result of\nthe [money transfer] in 1999” would “be zero.”). In fact, Karns\ndid not repay the funds with the exception of the fourth year\n(after Karns and SuperValu agreed to increase the minimum\npurchase amount in 2001 by $5 million); in 2003, Karns was\nrequired to pay a pro rata portion of $4,929.19. App. at 40–41.\nSuperValu treated this as a sales rebate that Karns failed to earn\nthrough its failure to meet the minimum purchase requirements\nthat year. Id. at 40–41, 131–32. The Tax Court was dealing\nwith a real life contract in a real life situation, and it decided\naccordingly.\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we disagree with the\n\n                                 13\n\fdissent as well as with the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Westpac.2\n\n                                IV.\n\n      For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the\njudgment of the Tax Court.3\n              Karns Prime & Fancy Food, Ltd. v.

Comm’r, 86 T.C.M.\n(CCH) 111 (2003). The Government has notified us that Tax Court\nmemorandum decisions are not binding precedent in the Tax Court,\nand that it has announced its nonacquiescence in the Tax Court’s\ndecision in Erickson Post.\n       3\n          The day before this opinion was due to be filed and after\nit had cleared the full court, we received a letter from counsel in\nthis case for the Department of Justice’s Tax Division advising that\nthe Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Procedure 2007-53,\nto be effective July 23, 2007, stating that the IRS will generally\nfollow the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Westpac. The letter states\nthat “[t]he Department of Justice is presently considering whether\nto change its position in this case in light of this new Revenue\nProcedure.” Inasmuch as we have not been notified of any change\nin position by a party before us, we proceed to file this opinion.\nAny relevant matter can be raised in a petition for panel rehearing,\nwhich will allow the DOJ and the IRS to confer further about what\nposition the Government wishes to take with respect to that\npetition.\n\n                                      14\n\f                   As a preliminary comment, this case is about\n           timing. The value of money depends on when it is\n           received.

Now\n             suppose Harry\n             Homeowner is short on\n             cash, and negotiates a\n             deal where the furniture\n             store gives him a 20%\n             discount as a cash\n             advance instead of the\n             25% off. This means the\n             store gives him $400\n             “cash back” today, and he\n             pays $2,000 for the four\n             chairs when they are\n             delivered shortly after the\n             first of the year. Harry\n             cannot go home and say\n             “I made $400 today”\n             unless he plans to skip out\n             on his obligation to pay\n             for the four chairs. Even\n             though he receives the\n\n                          16\n\f              cash, he has not made\n              money by buying the\n              chairs. He has to sell the\n              chairs for more than\n              $1,600 if he wants to\n              make money on them.\n              The reason why the $400\n              “cash back” is not income\n              is that, like a loan, the\n              money is encumbered\n              with a repayment\n              obligation to the furniture\n              store and the “cash back”\n              must be repaid if Harry\n              does not perform his\n              obligation.\n\nId. at 971–72 (emphasis added). “This case is that\nsimple,” the Court reiterated, “except that it involves\na little more math and a lot more money . . . .”\nConvinced that the agreement in that case was a\nnontaxable loan, the Westpac Court commented that\n“[i]t is hard to think of a way to make money by\nbuying things.” Id. at 971. Let’s check that out.\n\nII.    The Ninth Circuit Tax Shelter, or How to\n       Make Money By Buying Things\n\n        Consider a hypothetical involving Hal\nHomeowner, who would like to open a grocery\ndistribution center out of his garage. Hal goes to the\nsupermarket and, like Harry, is short on cash. Also\nconsider what happens when Hal Homeowner files\nhis taxes, which makes any simple hypothetical more\ncomplex. We will suppose that Hal makes a 100%\nprofit on the value of each carton, meaning that for\nevery $2,000 worth of food he buys he resells for\n\n                           17\n\f$4,000. We will also assume a typical corporate tax\nrate of 34% (which the Government applied to Karns)\napplies here.\n\n             Scenario 1\n\n             Hal Homeowner walks\n             into a supermarket and\n             eyes cartons of food for\n             $400 each that would be\n             ideal for his garage mini-\n             mart. The store owner\n             sees what Hal\n             Homeowner has in mind,\n             and when it becomes clear\n             that Hal has no money but\n             a lot of potential, the\n             owner puts this offer on\n             the table: “I will give you\n             20% off now if you agree\n             to buy five cartons\n             ($2,000 worth of food)\n             each year for the next six\n             years.” Under this\n             scheme, Hal pays each\n             year just $1,600 for five\n             cartons. This is an\n             example of a “volume\n             supply discount” similar\n             to the one that Harry\n             Homeowner negotiated;\n             Hal has gotten a 20%-off\n             deal, except there is no\n             cash advance involved\n             here, which makes the tax\n             calculation\n             straightforward. Each\n\n                          18\n\fyear, Hal simply pays\n$1,600 for $2,000 worth\nof goods. He deducts that\n$1,600 in business\nexpenses and reports\n$4,000 in resale to yield a\ntaxable income of $2,400,\nwhich carries a tax\nliability of $816 per year.\n\nScenario 2\n\nNow suppose the store\nowner proposes this: “I\nwill give you $400 now if\nyou buy $2,000 worth of\nfood each year for the\nnext six years. This will\nget you started with your\nbusiness, and you can just\npay me back the $400 at\nthe end of the year from\nyour resale proceeds.”\nHal cannot go home and\nsay “I made $400 today,”\nbecause he has an\nunconditional obligation\nto repay the $400 loan at\nthe end of the year. At\nthe end of the first year,\nHal duly pays back the\nloan, and on his tax forms\nhe simply deducts $2,000\nas business expenses from\nhis total resale proceeds\nof $4,000 to yield a\ntaxable income of $2,000,\n\n             19\n\f             which carries a tax\n             liability of $680 each\n             year. This is $136 per\n             year less than the tax\n             liability in Scenario 1,\n             which makes sense\n             because Hal makes $400\n             less each year.\n\n        The reason that the $400 was not income is\nthat it was subject to an unconditional repayment\nobligation, notwithstanding whether Hal performed\non his contract by meeting minimum purchase\nrequirements. In other words, it was a bona fide loan.\n\n             Scenario 3\n\n             Suppose the store owner\n             proposes this: “I’ll give\n             you $400 now if you\n             agree to buy five cartons\n             ($2,000 worth of food)\n             each year for the next six\n             years. If you can manage\n             that, you don’t have to\n             worry about paying me\n             back at the end of the\n             year.” This seems like\n             quite a deal to Hal, who\n             readily agrees. At the end\n             of the first year, Hal\n             deducts on his tax returns\n             $1,600 in business\n             expenses ($2,000 for the\n             food minus $400 “cash\n             back” off the full\n             purchase price given in\n\n                          20\n\f              exchange for the purchase\n              commitment), and reports\n              $4,000 in resale proceeds\n              to yield a gross income of\n              $2,400, which carries a\n              tax liability of $816. This\n              is the same as the tax\n              liability in Scenario 1, for\n              Hal has made the same\n              amount. In subsequent\n              years, Hal deducts $2,000\n              in business expenses and\n              reports $4,000 in resale\n              proceeds to yield a gross\n              income of $2,000 each\n              year, which carries an\n              annual tax liability of\n              $680.\n\n       When he first made the deal, Hal could go\nhome and say, “I made $400 today,” because he did\nnot plan to skip out on his obligation to buy five\ncartons each year, was confident that he would resell\nthe goods for profit, and thus had some assurance that\nhe could keep his money and make back the rest from\nthe proceeds of his resale. With this understanding,\nthe $400 given to him at the outset was an advance\npayment that was taxable income when received.\n\n       So far, there is little cause for controversy over\nhow Hal has done his taxes. He reported his profits\nas gross income in Scenario 1 (the volume supply\ndiscount without a cash advance); he repaid his loan\nand then reported his profits as gross income in\nScenario 2 (the loan); and he reported his profits,\nalong with the amount of cash he received up front, as\ngross income in Scenario 3 (the advance payment).\n\n                           21\n\fWhat happens if Hal wants to do his taxes a little\ndifferently in Scenario 3 in order to save some\nmoney?\n\n              Scenario 4\n\n              The facts are the same as\n              Scenario 3, but Hal does\n              his tax reporting\n              differently. Instead of\n              deducting $1,600 in the\n              first year, Hal deducts\n              $2,000 in business\n              expenses and reports\n              resale proceeds of $4,000\n              to yield a gross income of\n              $2,000 in the first year,\n              which carries a $680 tax\n              liability. Hal plans on\n              waiting until the end of\n              his six-year term to pay\n              tax on the $400 as “other\n              income” (i.e., “loan”\n              forgiveness). He has\n              realized a $136 tax\n              savings (the difference\n              between $816 due on\n              $2,400 in Scenario 3 and\n              $680 due on $2,000 in\n              this scenario).\n\n       By deferring the taxes due on the $400, Hal is\nable to take advantage now of $2,400 (the up-front\ncash plus the $2,000 he makes in profits) without\npaying taxes on that full amount. Put differently, this\nmeans that he is able to take advantage of a $136 tax\nsavings in the first year. If he pays taxes on the $400\n\n                           22\n\f           as income in the year of receipt (as in Scenario 3), the\n           present value of his tax liability over the course of the\n           six-year deal is $3,368.35.5 But if Hal defers payment\n           of taxes on the $400 until the end of Year 6 (as in\n           Scenario 4), the present value of his tax liability will\n           be only $3,331.87 over this same period. The present\n           value of his total tax savings is a difference of $36.48\n           ($3,368.35 in Scenario 3 minus $3,331.87 in Scenario\n           4), which is negligible when dealing in amounts so\n           small. But the amount grows when dealing in\n           millions.\n\n                  In Karns’s case, the deferral of the tax\n           payment resulted in a savings of about $500,000 by\n           Year 6—the same amount that the Government\n           argues is owed in back taxes. This sort of difference\n           demonstrates how advance payments confer an\n           economic benefit. As noted, they allow the recipient\n\n\n       5\n         The present value of money (at some future time) is\ncalculated by dividing the monetary amount (here: $816 in taxes on\na $2,400 income) by the following: the product of the number of\nyears (here: 1) and the discount rate (assumed: 7%) raised to the\npower of the number of years (here: 1).\n       Thus, the present value of an $816 tax liability for Year 1 at\nthe end of the first year at a 7% rate is $762.62; the present values\nof a $680 tax liability for Years 2–6 are $593.94 at the end of the\nsecond year, $555.08 at the end of the third year, $518.77 at the\nend of the fourth year, $484.83 at the end of the fifth year, and\n$453.11 at the end of the sixth year. Added together, this yields a\nsum of $3,368.35.\n       By contrast, the present value of an $816 tax liability for\nYear 1 at the end of the sixth year at a 7% rate is $543.74; the\npresent values of a $680 tax liability for Years 1–5 are $635.51 at\nthe end of the first year, plus—as before—$593.94 at the end of the\nsecond year, $555.08 at the end of the third year, $518.77 at the\nend of the fourth year, and $484.83 at the end of the fifth year.\nAdded together, this yields a sum of $3,331.87.\n\n                                       23\n\f“immediate use of the money [or savings] . . . and the\nopportunity to make a profit by providing goods or\nservices at a cost lower than the amount of the\npayment.” Indianapolis Power, 493 U.S. at 208\n(emphasis in original). For in Scenario 4 Hal’s\nbusiness expenses actually are only $1,600 ($2,000\nminus the $400 advance), and by reporting his\nexpenses as $2,000, he inflates his business\ndeductions. He has gained immediate use of the up-\nfront money and is able to profit by providing goods\nat a cost lower than the amount of the payment,\nresulting in a $136 tax savings in the first year. The\narrangement in this case is similar. The lesson: when\ntaxes on funds advanced in Year 1 are deferred and\ngoods purchased in Year 1 are resold for profit,\nmoney indeed can be made by buying things.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n        At first blush, both tax payment schemes—pay\nnow or pay later—may appear to be merely alternate\nways of doing the math, because Hal Homeowner and\nKarns will eventually pay taxes on the up-front\nmoney. But we cannot view the “pay later” method\nas just another way of calculating taxes, because our\nlaws require otherwise. First, Karns avails itself of an\neconomic benefit through this method, which\nfunctions like a tax-deferral shelter that the Code has\nnot authorized. Second, Karns’s attempt to consider\nas a loan money that it will never have to repay\ncontravenes the requirement that “an accrual-basis\ntaxpayer [which Karns is] . . . [must] treat advance\npayments as income in the year of receipt.”\nIndianapolis Power, 493 U.S. at 207 n.3 (citations\nomitted).\n\n       In sum, I am not persuaded by the analysis in\n\n                          24\n\fthe Ninth Circuit. It is the first and only Court of\nAppeals to conclude that trade discounts paid by the\nsupplier to a taxpayer to offset the taxpayer’s required\nminimum purchases are loans rather than advance\npayments. Its conclusion contradicts our own\nemphasis (both before and after Indianapolis Power)\nthat income may be considered to be a “loan” only\nwhen there is an unconditional repayment obligation.\nSee, e.g., Geftman v. Comm’r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757562\"><a href=\"/opinion/757562/jonathan-b-geftman-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (3d\nCir. 1998); Diamond Bros. v.

Funds received with no\nunconditional repayment obligation result in one set\nof profit margins and tax liabilities, and deferred tax\npayment on those same funds results in another set.\nFor practical and policy reasons, our Tax Code and\nmost decisions interpreting it require taxpayers to pay\ntaxes for the year of receipt on funds advanced to\nthem by suppliers when any purported repayment\nobligation is conditional on acts controlled by\ntaxpayers—i.e., when there is no unconditional\nrepayment obligation. Because there was no\nunconditional obligation to repay the money here, I\nbelieve that the $1.5 million received up front by\nKarns was an advance payment, taxable upon receipt.\nI therefore concur in affirming the Tax Court’s\nassessment of taxes owed.\n\n\n\n\n                          25\n\f                   Karns v. C.I.R.\n\n                       Dissent\n\n\n\n\nBRODY, District Judge\n\n\n\n\n       Because the agreements between Super Rite\nand Karns provided no guarantee that Super Rite\nwould allow Karns to keep the money it received as a\nloan from Super Rite, I respectfully dissent from the\nmajority’s conclusion that the loan was taxable\nincome in the year it was received.\n\n\n\n\n       According to the majority, the agreement\nbetween retailer Karns and supplier Super Rite is\nfunctionally a single advance rebate formally divided\ninto two parts: a loan with a multi-year repayment\nperiod; and a multi-year Supply Agreement. Super\nRite would pay the advance rebate in the form of a\nloan, and would forgive the loan in annual\ninstallments as long as Karns annually bought the\nrequisite amount of product under the Supply\nAgreement. The majority concludes that the money\nwas taxable when received because Karns was never\nobligated to repay the loan and always had control\nover whether it would keep the money. That Karns\nmight not be able to meet its obligations in the Supply\nAgreement is of no moment to the majority, which\nviews Karns’ ability to perform its contractual\nobligations as under Karns’ “control” for tax law\npurposes.\n\n                          26\n\f                  As the majority recognizes, this decision holds\n          that all advance trade rebates are taxable in the year\n          received, in direct opposition to the Ninth Circuit’s\n          opinion in Westpac Pacific Food v. C.I.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794699\"><a href=\"/opinion/794699/westpac-pacific-food-save-mart-supermarkets-inc-tax-matters-partner-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n          <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006) (Kleinfeld, J.) I would not reach that\n          broader question because the facts of Westpac are\n          distinguishable: in this case, the transactions gave the\n          taxpayer less control over the money than in the pure\n          advance rebate in Westpac. In Westpac, the retailer\n          was guaranteed to be able to keep the funds upon\n          completion of its purchase obligations. But here, the\n          loan provided no advance guarantee of forgiveness\n          even if Karns made every effort to complete the\n          purchases required by the Supply Agreement.6\n\n\n\n\n                 It is true that Karns’ annual loan payment\n          would be forgiven as long as Karns was “in\n          compliance” with the Supply Agreement for the year,\n          and that the two transactions are linked. App. at 49\n          (“Promissory Note”). But Super Rite (in its role as\n          supplier) had immense latitude to cancel the Supply\n          Agreement. Under Section 5(vi) of the Supply\n          Agreement, Super Rite could cancel the agreement\n\n\n\n\n                 Immediately upon the occurrence of a material\n                 adverse change in the condition (financial or\n                 otherwise), business or prospects of the\n                 Retailer or any guarantor of the Retailer’s\n                 liabilities and obligations hereunder.\n\n\n      6\n        I also disagree with the majority – Westpac was correctly\ndecided. Advance rebates should be considered income only when\nthey are actually earned through completed purchases.\n\n                                     27\n\f           App. at 52 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                   This broad discretion to cancel the Supply\n           Agreement for almost any kind of change in Karns or\n           its guarantors’ “condition” renders nigh illusory any\n           control Karns might have had over the continued\n           existence of the Supply Agreement.7 If Super Rite\n           cancelled the Supply Agreement, Karns would be\n           required to repay the loan. Karns, then, had little\n           meaningful control or “guarantee” that its loan would\n           be forgiven at the time it received the loan. Karns’\n           actions (meeting the Supply Agreement’s purchase\n           amount requirements) would have some role in\n           determining whether the loan would be forgiven. But\n           rather than being under Karns’ exclusive control,\n           forgiveness was ultimately subject to lender Super\n           Rite’s discretion over the Supply Agreement. As\n           such, it cannot be said that Karns had a “guarantee”\n           that it would be able to keep the money. See Comm’r\n           v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n           210 (1990) (“In determining whether [money is\n           taxable income when received], the crucial point is . .\n           . whether the taxpayer has some guarantee that he will\n           be allowed to keep the money.”)\n\n\n\n\n                  The Supply Agreement also contained a\n\n\n       7\n          This is not to say that the Supply Agreement is\nunenforceable as a matter of contract law – this is a federal law tax\ncase, not a state law contract case. The degree of control Karns\nhad over the continued existence of the Supply Agreement is\nrelevant here only to show that Karns had no meaningful\n“guarantee” that the Supply Agreement would continue.\n\n                                       28\n\fliquidated damages clause:\n\n\n\n\n       [T]he parties agree that upon Super Rite’s\n       cancellation of this agreement pursuant to\n       Sections 2 or 5 of this Agreement, the Retailer\n       will pay Super Rite as liquidated damages an\n       amount equal to 1.0% of the product of (i) the\n       Retailer’s aggregate purchases from Super Rite\n       during the preceding calendar year multiplied\n       by (ii) the number of years remaining in the\n       term of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\nApp. at 53 (Section 7 of Supply Agreement). That a\nremedy for breach of the Supply Agreement is\ncontained within the Supply Agreement itself belies\nthe view that the loan and the Supply Agreement\nwere one unitary advance rebate, with the loan simply\nfunctioning as a mechanism for quick collection of\nany unearned rebates. Instead, the loan was an\nindependent transaction with all the characteristics of\na bona fide loan.\n\n\n\n\n       The retail grocery business is a low-margin,\ncash-intensive endeavor. See Supermarket News 9,\nCredit Crunch (July 30, 2001), 2001 WLNR\n9062811; National Governors Association Center for\nBest Practices, Case Study: Pennsylvania’s Fresh\nFood Financing Initiative (noting that “[a]s\ncommunities become less dense, it is harder for\n\n\n\n\n                          29\n\f         grocery stores to remain viable.”).8 As such, access to\n         credit is extremely important to retailers like Karns,\n         and it makes sense that suppliers might step in to\n         provide that credit. That Super Rite served dual\n         functions of supplier and creditor does not mean that\n         in this case, the loan was not a loan.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n         A v a i l a b l e          o n l i n e      a t\nhttp://www.nga.org/Files/pdf/0510ACTIVELIVINGPA.PDF.\n\n                                   30\n\f</pre>",
