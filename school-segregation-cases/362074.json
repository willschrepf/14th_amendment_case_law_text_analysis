Six Unknown\nNamed Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), alleging that the prison’s\n\n\n\n       *\n        After examining the briefs and record, we have concluded that oral argument is\nunnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and record. See FED. R. A PP. P.\n34(a)(2)(C).\n\fNo. 09-4072                                                                             Page 2\n\nwarden, Helen Marberry, and educational superintendent, Diana Quinones, violated his\nright of access to courts by refusing to provide him with state legal materials and that\nQuinones retaliated against him for attempting to obtain those materials. Purkey also\ncontends that the Bureau of Prison’s policy excusing federal prisons from maintaining state\nlegal materials is unconstitutional. The district court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants, and Purkey appeals.\n\n        Purkey claims that Marberry and Quinones interfered with his ability to litigate both\na suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 relating to his confinement in a county facility and a collateral\nattack on a state felony-murder conviction. This interference, Purkey argues, caused him to\nlose these cases, so we begin by recounting some details of those suits.\n\n       Before his transfer to Terre Haute, Purkey was a state inmate in Wyandotte County,\nKansas, and was litigating multiple § 1983 suits against county officials. The federal district\ncourt in Kansas consolidated the claims, and with the help of appointed counsel, Purkey\ncontinued to pursue them from Terre Haute. The defendants moved for summary\njudgment, and about a month later the court allowed Purkey’s attorney to withdraw,\nleaving Purkey to oppose the motion on his own. In granting the defendants’ motion, the\ncourt acknowledged Purkey’s pro se status and emphasized that, although he had not\ncomplied with local rule 56.1, the decision was based on the merits of his claims. Purkey v.\nGreen, Nos. 01-3134-JAR & 99-3356-JAR, 2005 WL 627959 (D. Kan. Feb. 24 2005). The Tenth\nCircuit affirmed the judgment. Purkey v. Green, 164 F. App’x 792, 794 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\n        Around the same time, Purkey filed an unsuccessful petition in a Kansas trial court\nseeking postconviction relief from a state felony-murder conviction. The Court of Appeals\nof Kansas affirmed, rejecting Purkey’s arguments challenging the voluntariness of his plea,\nthe state’s compliance with the plea agreement, and the performance of defense counsel.\nPurkey v. Kansas, 131 P.3d 570 (Kan. Ct. App. 2006). Purkey later petitioned for a writ of\nhabeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, but the federal district court dismissed the petition\nas time-barred, Purkey v. Kansas, No. 06-3356-SAC, 2007 WL 4144919 (D. Kan. Nov. 19,\n2007), and the Tenth Circuit refused to certify an appeal, Purkey v. Kansas, 281 F. App’x 824\n(10th Cir. 2008).\n\n        To prepare himself for the § 1983 proceedings and his collateral attack on his state\nconviction, Purkey had asked the prison library in Terre Haute to help him obtain various\nstate-law materials, including the Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure. He noted in his\nrequests that he needed the materials for his ongoing § 1983 litigation, but apparently he\ndid not mention the collateral attack on his state conviction. In response, prison officials\ncited Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 1315.07 and informed Purkey that the library\nwas not required to provide inmates with materials pertaining to state law. The defendants\n\fNo. 09-4072                                                                            Page 3\n\nnevertheless attempted to accommodate Purkey’s requests, but he refused to either accept\nprinted results from an electronic search or pay for the copies. Purkey admits that library\nstaff offered him portions of the Kansas rules but says he refused them because they were\nirrelevant to his litigation. Purkey further claims that he orally complained about this\ndecision to both Quinones and her supervisors, and Quinones told him that, if he wanted\nthe materials, he would have to try to get them for himself.\n\n       After the prison library refused his requests, Purkey turned to a local law school for\nhelp, but his efforts were again stymied. A clinical professor did send numerous state-law\nmaterials to the prison with a request that they be placed in the SCU library, but the\ndonations did not include the specific materials Purkey had requested and they were not\nplaced in the SCU. Instead, Quinones put them in the main library, where SCU inmates\ncould access them only by written request. Purkey filed an administrative complaint\nchallenging this decision, asserting that Quinones had retaliated against him by\n“confiscating” these books and that the action had caused him to overlook the filing rules\npertaining to his § 1983 suit. Purkey’s administrative appeal was denied at every stage,\nand each time he received the same response: Nonreligious donations must be available to\nall inmates, and because the SCU is segregated from the general population, the materials\nhad to be placed in the main library. In her motion for summary judgment, Quinones\nadded that the materials were not confiscated; the law school had donated them to the\nprison and not to Purkey.\n\n        When Purkey filed his initial complaint in this case, he named six defendants, and\nasserted a challenge to the conditions of his confinement under the Eighth Amendment, in\naddition to the access-to-courts claims and retaliation claim that are part of this appeal.\nThe district court dismissed the case at screening, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, reasoning that the\nallegations were unrelated and thus should be raised in separate suits. The court invited\nPurkey to amend his complaint and pursue separate litigation raising any claims he excised\nfrom his amended pleadings. He complied with the court’s instruction and amended his\ncomplaint to focus on his denied access to courts, arguing both that he was injured by the\nprison’s refusal to provide him with state legal materials and that the prison policy\ncondoning this response was unconstitutional on its face. Purkey also persisted with his\nretaliation claim against Quinones, but he dropped his challenge under the Eighth\nAmendment.\n\n        The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Marberry and Quinones.\nThe court found that Purkey’s inability to access the Kansas materials had not harmed him,\nso he could not establish a claim of denied access. The court also rejected Purkey’s\nretaliation claim, concluding that Purkey’s complaints about Quinones had not motivated\nher conduct. Although Purkey had dropped his Eighth Amendment claim from his\n\fNo. 09-4072                                                                               Page 4\n\namended pleadings, the court nonetheless ruled against him on this issue, concluding that\nhe had not shown that conditions of his confinement were unconstitutional.\n\n        On appeal Purkey first challenges the district court’s conclusion that he had not\nsuffered an injury sufficient to establish a violation of his right to access to courts. Courts\nhave long recognized an inmate’s right of meaningful access to courts, see Bounds v. Smith,\n430 U.S. 817, 822-23 (1977); Lehn v. Holmes, 364 F.3d 862, 865-66 (7th Cir. 2004), but that right\nis violated only when an inmate is deprived of access and suffers an injury as a result of the\ndeprivation, see Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349 (1996); Ortiz v. Downey, 561 F.3d 664, 671\n(7th Cir. 2009). To establish an “actual injury,” an inmate must show that an attempt to\npursue nonfrivolous litigation was hindered by unjustified acts or conditions caused by the\ndefendants. See Tarpley v. Allen County, 312 F.3d 895, 899 (7th Cir. 2002). To satisfy the\n“actual injury” requirement, Purkey points to his failed efforts to litigate his § 1983 suit and\nhis collateral challenge to his state murder conviction. But Purkey has not shown injury in\neither case. The federal district court in Kansas ruled against Purkey because his § 1983\nclaims lacked merit and not because he failed to comply with a procedural requirement.\nAnd the state courts rejected Purkey’s claims because he failed to produce evidence\nsupporting his arguments. Nothing in the Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure or any other\nbook relating to state law could have changed these results. Because these adverse\ndecisions were unrelated to any harm caused by Purkey’s inability to access state-law\nmaterials, he failed to show that the defendants violated his right to access the courts. See\nSimkins v. Bruce, 406 F.3d 1239, 1244 (10th Cir. 2005) (recognizing no actual injury where\nunderlying case is decided for reasons “logically and practically unrelated” to alleged\nunjustified acts); Deleon v. Doe, 361 F.3d 93, 94 (2d Cir. 2004) (same).\n\n        Purkey also attacks the policy excusing federal prisons from providing state legal\nmaterials, claiming that it is unconstitutional on its face because it precludes inmates from\nmeaningful participation in state-court litigation. Although the policy may be harsh,\nPurkey’s claim is doomed by the fact that he has not suffered any actual injury. In Lewis the\nSupreme Court held that a prisoner has no standing to claim a violation of his right of\naccess to the courts unless he can point to an actual injury. 518 U.S. at 349-51 (1996); see,\ne.g., Cunningham v. Dist. Attorney’s Office, 592 F.3d 1237, 1271 (11th Cir. 2010); White v.\nKautzky, 494 F.3d 677, 680 (8th Cir. 2007). Because Purkey’s lack of access to state-law\nmaterials did not hinder his efforts in either of the cases he mentions, and because he has\nnot pointed to any other litigation he might have pursued, he lacks standing to challenge\nthe policy’s constitutionality. See Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 415 (2002); Bridges v.\nGilbert, 557 F.3d 541, 553-54 (7th Cir. 2009).\n\n        Purkey next argues that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment\non his retaliation claim against Quinones by applying the wrong standard and ignoring\n\fNo. 09-4072                                                                             Page 5\n\ndisputed questions of fact. To establish a claim of retaliation under the First Amendment,\nPurkey needed to show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) he suffered a\ndeprivation likely to prevent future protected activities, and (3) there was a causal\nconnection between the two. See Watkins v. Kasper, 599 F.3d 791, 794 (7th Cir. 2010). Purkey\nmaintains that Quinones placed the donated books in the main prison library in retaliation\nfor his complaints about her refusal to help him obtain state-law materials. Although the\nfiling of administrative grievances is protected conduct, see Pearson v. Welborn, 471 F.3d 732,\n740 (7th Cir. 2006), Purkey’s retaliation claim fails because he has not established a causal\nlink between his complaints and Quinones’s actions. Quinones said she put the donated\nbooks in the main library so that they could be used by all inmates, and Purkey has done\nnothing to undermine this justification. Moreover, it is apparent that at least one of\nPurkey’s complaints about Quinones came after she put the books in the main library. To\nthe extent that this complaint is the basis of Purkey’s retaliation claim, Quinones could not\nhave retaliated against Purkey for an action he had not yet taken.\n\n        And this would end matters but for the district court’s handling of Purkey’s\namended complaint. Purkey argues that the court erroneously required him to amend his\ncomplaint and then wrongly decided the Eighth Amendment claims that he had dropped\nfrom his pleadings. The first argument is without merit: “Unrelated claims against\ndifferent defendants belong in different suits,” George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir.\n2007), and the district court properly refused to consider unrelated claims together. But\nPurkey’s second argument is correct. The amended complaint did not challenge the\nconditions of his confinement, and because that version of the complaint superseded the\noriginal, see French v. Wachovia Bank, 574 F.3d 830, 835 (7th Cir. 2009), the district court\nwrongly addressed an issue that was not presented. See Collins v. Kibort, 143 F.3d 331, 335\n(7th Cir. 1998). We therefore VACATE the portion of the judgment relating to Purkey’s\nclaims under the Eighth Amendment and REMAND for the sole purpose of excising that\ndiscussion. The remainder of the district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\f",

App’x 824\n(10th Cir. 2008).\n\n        To prepare himself for the § 1983 proceedings and his collateral attack on his state\nconviction, Purkey had asked the prison library in Terre Haute to help him obtain various\nstate-law materials, including the Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure. He noted in his\nrequests that he needed the materials for his ongoing § 1983 litigation, but apparently he\ndid not mention the collateral attack on his state conviction. In response, prison officials\ncited Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 1315.07 and informed Purkey that the library\nwas not required to provide inmates with materials pertaining to state law. The defendants\n\fNo. 09-4072                                                                            Page 3\n\nnevertheless attempted to accommodate Purkey’s requests, but he refused to either accept\nprinted results from an electronic search or pay for the copies.

Purkey further claims that he orally complained about this\ndecision to both Quinones and her supervisors, and Quinones told him that, if he wanted\nthe materials, he would have to try to get them for himself.\n\n       After the prison library refused his requests, Purkey turned to a local law school for\nhelp, but his efforts were again stymied. A clinical professor did send numerous state-law\nmaterials to the prison with a request that they be placed in the SCU library, but the\ndonations did not include the specific materials Purkey had requested and they were not\nplaced in the SCU. Instead, Quinones put them in the main library, where SCU inmates\ncould access them only by written request. Purkey filed an administrative complaint\nchallenging this decision, asserting that Quinones had retaliated against him by\n“confiscating” these books and that the action had caused him to overlook the filing rules\npertaining to his § 1983 suit. Purkey’s administrative appeal was denied at every stage,\nand each time he received the same response: Nonreligious donations must be available to\nall inmates, and because the SCU is segregated from the general population, the materials\nhad to be placed in the main library. In her motion for summary judgment, Quinones\nadded that the materials were not confiscated; the law school had donated them to the\nprison and not to Purkey.\n\n        When Purkey filed his initial complaint in this case, he named six defendants, and\nasserted a challenge to the conditions of his confinement under the Eighth Amendment, in\naddition to the access-to-courts claims and retaliation claim that are part of this appeal.\nThe district court dismissed the case at screening, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, reasoning that the\nallegations were unrelated and thus should be raised in separate suits. The court invited\nPurkey to amend his complaint and pursue separate litigation raising any claims he excised\nfrom his amended pleadings. He complied with the court’s instruction and amended his\ncomplaint to focus on his denied access to courts, arguing both that he was injured by the\nprison’s refusal to provide him with state legal materials and that the prison policy\ncondoning this response was unconstitutional on its face. Purkey also persisted with his\nretaliation claim against Quinones, but he dropped his challenge under the Eighth\nAmendment.\n\n        The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Marberry and Quinones.\nThe court found that Purkey’s inability to access the Kansas materials had not harmed him,\nso he could not establish a claim of denied access. The court also rejected Purkey’s\nretaliation claim, concluding that Purkey’s complaints about Quinones had not motivated\nher conduct. Although Purkey had dropped his Eighth Amendment claim from his\n\fNo. 09-4072                                                                               Page 4\n\namended pleadings, the court nonetheless ruled against him on this issue, concluding that\nhe had not shown that conditions of his confinement were unconstitutional.\n\n        On appeal Purkey first challenges the district court’s conclusion that he had not\nsuffered an injury sufficient to establish a violation of his right to access to courts. Courts\nhave long recognized an inmate’s right of meaningful access to courts, see Bounds v. Smith,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109643\"><a href=\"/opinion/109643/bounds-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822-23 (1977); Lehn v.

To establish an “actual injury,” an inmate must show that an attempt to\npursue nonfrivolous litigation was hindered by unjustified acts or conditions caused by the\ndefendants. See Tarpley v. Allen County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780075\"><a href=\"/opinion/780075/wesley-r-tarpley-v-allen-county-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 899 (7th Cir. 2002). To satisfy the\n“actual injury” requirement, Purkey points to his failed efforts to litigate his § 1983 suit and\nhis collateral challenge to his state murder conviction. But Purkey has not shown injury in\neither case. The federal district court in Kansas ruled against Purkey because his § 1983\nclaims lacked merit and not because he failed to comply with a procedural requirement.\nAnd the state courts rejected Purkey’s claims because he failed to produce evidence\nsupporting his arguments. Nothing in the Kansas Rules of Civil Procedure or any other\nbook relating to state law could have changed these results. Because these adverse\ndecisions were unrelated to any harm caused by Purkey’s inability to access state-law\nmaterials, he failed to show that the defendants violated his right to access the courts. See\nSimkins v. Bruce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165820\"><a href=\"/opinion/165820/simkins-v-bruce/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1244 (10th Cir. 2005) (recognizing no actual injury where\nunderlying case is decided for reasons “logically and practically unrelated” to alleged\nunjustified acts); Deleon v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785412\"><a href=\"/opinion/785412/isidoro-deleon-v-john-doe-mail-room-supervisor-gmcf-john-doe-mail-room/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (2d Cir. 2004) (same).\n\n        Purkey also attacks the policy excusing federal prisons from providing state legal\nmaterials, claiming that it is unconstitutional on its face because it precludes inmates from\nmeaningful participation in state-court litigation. Although the policy may be harsh,\nPurkey’s claim is doomed by the fact that he has not suffered any actual injury. In Lewis the\nSupreme Court held that a prisoner has no standing to claim a violation of his right of\naccess to the courts unless he can point to an actual injury. 518 U.S. at 349-51 (1996); see,\ne.g., Cunningham v. Dist. Attorney’s Office, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78555\"><a href=\"/opinion/78555/cunningham-v-dist-attorneys-office-for-escambia/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1271 (11th Cir. 2010); White v.\nKautzky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1426817\"><a href=\"/opinion/1426817/white-v-kautzky/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 680 (8th Cir. 2007). Because Purkey’s lack of access to state-law\nmaterials did not hinder his efforts in either of the cases he mentions, and because he has\nnot pointed to any other litigation he might have pursued, he lacks standing to challenge\nthe policy’s constitutionality. See Christopher v. Harbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (2002); Bridges v.\nGilbert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433891\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433891/bridges-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553-54 (7th Cir. 2009).\n\n        Purkey next argues that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment\non his retaliation claim against Quinones by applying the wrong standard and ignoring\n\fNo. 09-4072                                                                             Page 5\n\ndisputed questions of fact. To establish a claim of retaliation under the First Amendment,\nPurkey needed to show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) he suffered a\ndeprivation likely to prevent future protected activities, and (3) there was a causal\nconnection between the two. See Watkins v. Kasper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1037\"><a href=\"/opinion/1037/watkins-v-kasper/\"><span class=\"volume\">599</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794 (7th Cir. 2010). Purkey\nmaintains that Quinones placed the donated books in the main prison library in retaliation\nfor his complaints about her refusal to help him obtain state-law materials. Although the\nfiling of administrative grievances is protected conduct, see Pearson v. Welborn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796266\"><a href=\"/opinion/796266/alex-pearson-cross-appellee-v-george-c-welborn-warden-and-kristen/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">732</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n740 (7th Cir. 2006), Purkey’s retaliation claim fails because he has not established a causal\nlink between his complaints and Quinones’s actions. Quinones said she put the donated\nbooks in the main library so that they could be used by all inmates, and Purkey has done\nnothing to undermine this justification. Moreover, it is apparent that at least one of\nPurkey’s complaints about Quinones came after she put the books in the main library. To\nthe extent that this complaint is the basis of Purkey’s retaliation claim, Quinones could not\nhave retaliated against Purkey for an action he had not yet taken.\n\n        And this would end matters but for the district court’s handling of Purkey’s\namended complaint. Purkey argues that the court erroneously required him to amend his\ncomplaint and then wrongly decided the Eighth Amendment claims that he had dropped\nfrom his pleadings. The first argument is without merit: “Unrelated claims against\ndifferent defendants belong in different suits,” George v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435220\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435220/george-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 (7th Cir.\n2007), and the district court properly refused to consider unrelated claims together. But\nPurkey’s second argument is correct. The amended complaint did not challenge the\nconditions of his confinement, and because that version of the complaint superseded the\noriginal, see French v. Wachovia Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1359673\"><a href=\"/opinion/1359673/french-v-wachovia-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 835 (7th Cir. 2009), the district court\nwrongly addressed an issue that was not presented. See Collins v. Kibort, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754168\"><a href=\"/opinion/754168/73-empl-prac-dec-p-45352-49-fed-r-evid-serv-330-charles-collins-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335\n(7th Cir. 1998). We therefore VACATE the portion of the judgment relating to Purkey’s\nclaims under the Eighth Amendment and REMAND for the sole purpose of excising that\ndiscussion. The remainder of the district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
