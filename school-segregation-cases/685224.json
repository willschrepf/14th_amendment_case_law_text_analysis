Suits have recently been filed in district courts of the following districts of this Circuit: Northern and Southern Districts of Mississippi; Northern, Middle, and Southern Districts of Florida; and the Eastern, Western, and Southern Districts of Texas.

The defendant school districts traditionally have assigned students and faculty to schools in accordance with an official state policy requiring racial segregation in the public schools of Texas resulting in the assignment of white students and faculty and black students and faculty to separate schools.  These districts presently assign students to these public schools on the basis of plans which have resulted in the continued operation of their schools as dual school systems based on race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint further alleged that the Lubbock and San Angelo districts 'are discriminating against Mexican-American students by assigning Mexican-American students to schools on the basis of their ethnic origin' and that such schools 'are attended almost exclusively by Mexican-American and Negro students.'  The complaint requested that the defendants be enjoined from discriminating on the basis of race and ethnic origin and prayed 'that the defendant school districts be ordered forthwith to adopt and implement (desegregation) plans * * * prior to the commencement of the 1970-71 school year.'  A certificate of the Attorney General as required by 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6 is attached to the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Lubbock and Wichita Falls districts for which school desegregation plans had been prepared and recommended to the district by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Texas Education Agency, the government applied August 8 to the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern District of Texas for an order to show cause why the plans should not be implemented immediately.

The effect of the order was to deny the injunction, since desegregation plans would not be put into operation until some time after the opening of schools for the 1970-71 term.  See U.S. v.
