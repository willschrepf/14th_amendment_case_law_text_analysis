His application\n\nwas denied because his achievement test score was not high enough\n\nfor a white student applicant, although it was high enough for a\n\nblack student applicant.         The Cavaliers claim that but for a race-\n\nconscious admission policy, Hunter would have been admitted to\n\nCMMS.    The School Board has not denied this.\n\n       The School Board has admitted that its admission policy for\n\nCMMS    does   employ   racial    classifications     in   order   to   meet   a\n\nparticular racial balance at CMMS.         The procedure for admission to\n\nCMMS is contained in School Board Policy JECC.                To qualify for\n\nadmission to CMMS, an applicant must: 1) have high motivation\n\ntoward excellence, as evidenced by consistent achievement and\n\nacceptable behavior; 2) be performing on grade level or better;\n\n3) have a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or better in reading and\n\n      1\n        On this appeal, as throughout the proceedings in the district court, the\nCavaliers proceed pro se.\n\n                                       2\n\fmath       and   2.5    or   better   overall;   and   4)    have   95%   or   better\n\nattendance.            In addition, the student must take a standardized\n\nachievement        test,     the   California    Achievement     Test     (CAT),   for\n\nranking purposes.2\n\n       After the initial qualifications are taken into account, the\n\nnumber of qualified applicants usually far exceeds the number of\n\navailable openings.            To determine which students will be offered\n\nadmission, CMMS gives priority to qualified siblings of students\n\nwho also attend CMMS and to black students who would otherwise\n\nattend a school with over 90% black student enrollment.                    CMMS then\n\nranks the remaining qualified applicants based on their CAT test\n\nscore.       Regarding these latter rankings, the policy states that\n\nCMMS “will maintain a list of rankings for black students and a\n\nlist of rankings for white students.”                  The vacancies are then\n\nfilled so that CMMS will have a racial mix of 50% white and 50%\n\nblack, plus or minus 15 percentage points.3                 CMMS accepts qualified\n\napplicants of any race subject to the number of openings available\n\nby race, according to the required racial mix, and no applicant of\n\nany race who does not meet the initial admission requirements is\n\naccepted.\n\n\n\n      2\n        The policy also has two nonacademic requirements: the students must have\nparental permission and support and be in good health or under a doctor’s care.\n       3\n        In 2001, the Board approved Item No. 37, which required CMMS enrollment\nto be within the parameters of a consent decree entered in 1981, discussed infra.\nThe consent decree gave a projected racial enrollment for CMMS of 50%\nblack/white, plus or minus 15 percentage points.\n\n                                           3\n\f      Hunter met the initial admission requirements for entrance\n\ninto CMMS for the 2002–2003 school year.         However, based on his CAT\n\ntest score, and due to the number of slots available for white\n\nstudents, he was not admitted.\n\n      For the 2002–2003 school year at CMMS, the lowest CAT test\n\nscore for a nonsibling white applicant given admission to the sixth\n\ngrade was 142; the lowest CAT test score for a nonsibling black\n\napplicant given admission was 117.           Hunter’s CAT test score was\n\n140. There were seven nonsibling white applicants not selected for\n\nadmission who had scores of 141 and six, including Hunter, who had\n\nscores of 140.      Sixty-seven black students who scored less than\n\nHunter (140) on their CAT test were admitted to the sixth grade.\n\n      The   2002–2003    sixth   grade    CMMS   class    consisted    of   449\n\nstudents.    Fifty-one siblings were admitted, of whom 42 were white\n\nand 9 were black. Another 398 nonsibling students were admitted on\n\nthe basis of their CAT test score ranking, of whom 259 were white\n\nand 139 were black.      While the incoming sixth grade class was 67%\n\nwhite and 33% black, the total student composition of CMMS for the\n\n2002–2003 school year was 65% white and 35% black, a result barely\n\nwithin the    School    Board–required     racial   mix   for   CMMS   of   50%\n\nblack/white, plus or minus 15 percentage points.4\n\n      4\n        Based on our review of data obtained by the Cavaliers from the School\nBoard and submitted in conjunction with a motion for preliminary injunction, it\nappears that if the School Board did not use separate test-ranking lists for\nwhite and black applicants, the score that would have resulted in a sixth grade\nclass at CMMS for the 2002–2003 school year of roughly the same size as the\nactual class would have been 130. Using a score of 130, the sixth grade class\napparently would have been approximately 25% black and 75% white.\n\n                                      4\n\f      The Cavaliers, on behalf of Hunter, filed suit against the\n\nSchool Board, and twelve of its members, alleging that Hunter was\n\ndiscriminated against on the basis of his race when he was denied\n\nadmission    to   CMMS.       The     Cavaliers   sought    declaratory     and\n\ninjunctive, compensatory damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs,\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, and\n\n2000d.    The parties consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by a\n\nmagistrate judge, and the district court referred the case to a\n\nmagistrate judge.      The School Board filed a motion to dismiss or\n\nfor summary judgment on the ground that the admission procedure for\n\nCMMS is pursuant to a court-ordered consent decree and, therefore,\n\nis constitutional.        The magistrate judge granted the defendants’\n\nmotion, dismissing all claims against all parties.5             The Cavaliers\n\nsubsequently filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which the\n\nmagistrate judge denied.       The Cavaliers then timely appealed.\n\n\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n      The Board attempts to justify its admission policy based on a\n\nconsent decree entered in 1981 involving the Board.              Because this\n\nconsent decree no longer applies to CMMS, it cannot justify the\n\nBoard’s policy, and because the Board shows no other compelling\n\ngovernmental interest for its racial classification, we hold that\n\n\n\n      5\n        The magistrate judge previously had dismissed the Cavaliers’ claim for\ncompensatory damages against the individual members of the School Board based on\nqualified immunity. The Cavaliers have not appealed that ruling.\n\n                                        5\n\fthe policy is unconstitutional.            Furthermore, even if CMMS were\n\nstill subject to the decree, because the Board has not shown that\n\nit has considered any race-neutral means to achieve its desired\n\nracial mix and relies exclusively on a racial quota, the policy is\n\nnot narrowly tailored.       Therefore, we reverse and remand.6\n\n\n\n\nI.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review de novo the magistrate judge’s grant of summary\n\njudgment.7    Austin v. Will-Burt Co., 361 F.3d 862, 866 (5th Cir.\n\n2004). Summary judgment is proper only if, viewing the evidence in\n\n      6\n        On July 29, 2004, some two months subsequent to oral argument herein, the\nSchool Board filed with this court a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot. The\nSchool Board attached to its motion an affidavit from its counsel in which she\nstated that: on May 19, 2004, she mailed a letter to the Cavaliers advising them\nthat there were openings for the eighth grade at CMMS for the 2004–2005 school\nyear; if Hunter met the general requirements for admission, he would be admitted\nto the eighth grade at CMMS upon the submission of an application, included with\nthe letter to the Cavaliers; and no further testing would be needed for\nadmission.    The School Board claims that this offer of admission to Hunter\nrenders the appeal moot.\n      We disagree. In their complaint, the Cavaliers sought, among other things,\ncompensatory damages.    In their opposition to the School Board’s motion to\ndismiss the appeal, the Cavaliers have alleged damages due to the School Board’s\npolicy.    The Cavaliers brought their suit in 2002 after Hunter was denied\nadmission to CMMS for the 2002–2003 school year, his sixth grade year. The\nCavaliers allege that because of the denial of Hunter’s admission to CMMS, in\norder to provide the best alternative to CMMS, they enrolled him in a private\nschool for two years, his sixth and seventh grade years, at a cost that was\npresumably higher than what they would have had to pay if Hunter had attended\nCMMS. The private school was also allegedly further from their residence than\nCMMS, resulting in additional transportation costs. The Cavaliers have sought,\namong other things, compensatory damages and have alleged damages due to the\nSchool Board’s policy. Past damages that are in no way addressed by the offer\nof admission to Hunter for his eighth grade year. We accordingly deny the motion\nto dismiss the appeal as moot.\n      7\n        Although the Board filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment,\nbecause the magistrate judge considered materials outside of the pleadings, we\ntreat the motion as a motion for summary judgment. See Meister v. Tex. Adjutant\nGeneral's Dept., 233 F.3d 332, 335 (5th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                       6\n\fthe light      most   favorable     to   the   nonmoving   party,   the    record\n\nestablishes “that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\n\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.”      FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c).\n\nII.   Constitutionality of the Admission Policy\n\n      A.      Strict Scrutiny Review\n\n      We apply strict scrutiny review to the School Board’s race-\n\nconscious admission policy: “It is by now well established that\n\n‘all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection\n\nClause must be strictly scrutinized.’”              Gratz v. Bollinger, 123\n\nS.Ct. 2411, 2427 (2003) (quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\n\nPeña, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 2111 (1995)) (emphasis added).                      To pass\n\nstrict scrutiny review, the School Board must demonstrate that the\n\n“use of race in its current admission program employs ‘narrowly\n\ntailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.’”\n\nGratz, 123 S.Ct. at 2427 (quoting Adarand, 115 S.Ct. at 2113)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      B.      Compelling Governmental Interest\n\n              1.   Remedying Current Effects of Past Segregation\n\n      Because the School Board previously operated a dual school\n\nsystem, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, it bears the\n\n“primary responsibility to ‘eliminate from the public schools all\n\nvestiges of state-imposed segregation.’” Davis v. East Baton Rouge\n\nParish Sch. Bd., 721 F.2d 1425, 1434, 1436 (5th Cir. 1983) (quoting\n\n                                         7\n\fMilliken v. Bradley, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2762 (1977)).               Remedying the\n\npresent effects of past discrimination is a compelling interest\n\nthat in particular circumstances may justify appropriate use of\n\ncertain racial classifications. Dallas Fire Fighters Ass’n v. City\n\nof Dallas, Tex., 150 F.3d 438, 441 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n      In justifying its admission policy, the School Board has\n\nrelied exclusively on a consent decree entered by the Western\n\nDistrict of Louisiana in 1981 directing the desegregation of the\n\nCaddo Parish school system (the 1981 Consent Decree).               The School\n\nBoard has not identified any current effect or condition at CMMS\n\nthat is    traceable    to   the   past    segregation    within    the   school\n\nsystem.8     Therefore, whether the School Board’s use of racial\n\nclassifications     serves    a    compelling    governmental      interest   by\n\nseeking to remedy the current effects of past segregation depends\n\nentirely on whether the 1981 Consent Decree obligates the School\n\nBoard to use racial classifications in its current admission\n\npolicy.    As we conclude that the 1981 Consent Decree is no longer\n\napplicable to CMMS, it cannot justify the School Board’s race-\n\nconscious admission policy.\n\n                  a.    Background of the 1981 Consent Decree\n\n\n\n      8\n        In their interrogatories, the Cavaliers asked that the School Board\ndescribe all evidence of present effects of past racial discrimination that could\njustify the use of racial classifications in its admission process. The School\nBoard responded that the reason for the use of the racial classifications was “to\ncomply with the [1981] Consent Decree.”      The School Board then stated that\n“[t]here has not been any attempt to determine if other reasons exist which could\njustify the use of racial classifications.”\n\n                                       8\n\f      The 1981 Consent Decree has it roots in litigation that began\n\nin 1965 and that has been the subject of multiple cases within this\n\ncircuit.    The following historical background comes from two\n\nearlier cases involving the 1981 Consent Decree: Jones v. Caddo\n\nParish School Board, 735 F.2d 923, 924–26, (5th Cir. 1981) (Jones\n\nI), and Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 204 F.R.D. 97, 98–100\n\n(W.D. La. 2001) (Jones II):\n\n      In 1965, the parents of seven black children commenced a suit\n\nagainst the School Board seeking desegregation of the Caddo Parish\n\npublic schools. The United States later intervened as a plaintiff.\n\nIn 1973, the district court ordered the School Board to implement\n\na desegregation plan; a plan was developed and took effect.                 In\n\n1976, the School Board filed a motion to have the school system\n\ndeclared unitary, which would have warranted the dismissal of the\n\noriginal suit; however, the United States opposed the motion.                In\n\n1977, the district court: (1) ruled that the School Board had fully\n\ncomplied   with   the     1973    court-ordered    desegregation    plan;   (2)\n\ndeclared the school system to be unitary; and (3) dismissed the\n\nsuit against the School Board. Thereafter, the United States filed\n\na motion to amend the judgment, the filing of which suspended the\n\nfinality of the judgment pending decision on the motion.              In 1980,\n\nthe   district    court    gave    notice   that   unless   the    plaintiffs’\n\nattorneys objected, the United States, as plaintiff-intervenor,\n\nwould represent the interests of the private plaintiffs; the\n\n\n                                        9\n\fdistrict court did not receive any objections.        The United States\n\nand the School Board then entered into negotiations, which resulted\n\nin the district court-ordered 1981 Consent Decree.\n\n                b.    1981 Consent Decree\n\n     In the 1981 Consent Decree, the district court determined that\n\n“the plan for the System embodied in this Decree is reasonable and\n\nappropriate for the additional desegregation of the System, and\n\nupon its successful implementation will in fact and in law create\n\na unitary school system for Caddo Parish.”\n\n     The decree, among other things, called for the establishment\n\nof magnet schools:\n\n     “The Board will establish new magnet schools at three\n     elementary schools . . . and at one middle school (Eden\n     Gardens Junior High School) in order to enhance the\n     quality of education and bring about a greater degree of\n     desegregation at those schools. . . . The Board will\n     establish an aggressive magnet recruitment program and\n     will permit and encourage students to attend magnet\n     schools using every reasonable effort to achieve the\n     projected racial enrollment for each school within the\n     time period permitted under this Decree.”\n\nThe decree also detailed the projected racial enrollment for each\n\nmagnet school and how the projection was to be achieved: “It is\n\nunderstood by the parties that magnet programs at particular\n\nschools may be revised in order to effectively provide for the\n\nrecruitment and retention of students in the magnet schools and to\n\nachieve and maintain a desegregated enrollment.”             The projected\n\nracial   enrollment   for   CMMS—formerly   Eden   Gardens    Junior   High\n\nSchool, located in a predominantly black neighborhood with a\n\n                                   10\n\fpredominantly black student body—was 50% white and 50% black.\n\n“[E]nrollment at each magnet school” was to “be on a parish wide\n\nbasis” and students were to be assigned to the magnet schools based\n\non the following priorities, which were the only priorities stated\n\nin the decree: 1) qualified siblings of students who attend the\n\nmagnet school; 2) qualified black students who would otherwise\n\nattend a school with over 90% black student enrollment; and 3)\n\nqualified white students who would otherwise attend a school with\n\nover 65% white student enrollment. These priorities were to apply,\n\nhowever, only to the extent that they did not impede the School\n\nBoard’s achievement of the projected racial enrollments at the\n\nmagnet schools.\n\n     The School Board was to implement the magnet school program at\n\nEden Gardens Junior High, which would become CMMS, before or\n\nbeginning with the 1982–83 school year.   The School Board was to\n\n“use its best efforts to attain the projected racial enrollments .\n\n. . by the end of the 1984–85 school year by developing attractive\n\nprograms at [CMMS] and by encouraging students of both races to\n\nattend [CMMS] and benefit from [its] programs.”\n\n     The school system was to remain under the jurisdiction of the\n\ndistrict court during the period in which the decree was in effect,\n\nsubject to certain provisions that provided for the termination of\n\nthe court’s jurisdiction. The decree specifically provided for the\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\ftermination of the district court’s jurisdiction over the magnet\n\nand laboratory9 schools:\n\n     “With respect to the magnet school and laboratory school\n     proposals contained in . . . this Decree, the Board shall\n     have three years from the respective implementation dates\n     for each such school within which to meet the projected\n     enrollments at the magnet and laboratory schools. Such\n     projected enrollments for a particular school shall be\n     deemed to have been met if the actual enrollment in the\n     school is within ± 15 percentage points of the projection\n     for such school . . . .      Upon meeting the projected\n     enrollments for all magnet and laboratory schools covered\n     by this Section D of Part V, this Decree shall terminate\n     as to such schools, the Board shall be entitled to an\n     order of the Court so stating, and the United States\n     shall not be entitled to seek any further or additional\n     remedy with respect to such schools.”\n\n     Finally, the decree outlined the procedure by which the School\n\nBoard could seek an order declaring the school system to be unitary\n\nand dismissing the case:\n\n     “At any time after the 1983–84 school year, the Board may\n     file a Notice of Compliance with the terms and conditions\n     of this Decree. If the United States agrees that the\n     Board is in full compliance with the terms and conditions\n     of this Decree, the United States shall join in the\n     Notice and shall state that it supports an order\n     declaring the System to be unitary and dismissing the\n     case. If no objection to the Notice is made within 30\n     days of its filing, the Court shall enter an order\n     declaring the entire system unitary, to the extent it has\n     not already been so declared, and terminating this case.\n     Any objections must be specific as to alleged terms of\n     noncompliance with the provisions of this Decree. The\n     objections shall be heard by the Court under reasonable\n     procedures set forth by the Court and in the event any\n     further remedy is ordered, it shall be limited to\n     resolving the objection so filed.”\n\n\n\n     9\n        The decree directed the School Board to establish a laboratory school\nprogram that would be operated in conjunction with area universities and\ncolleges.\n\n                                     12\n\f                 c.   1990 Order\n\n     In 1987, the School Board filed a Notice of Compliance with\n\nthe 1981 Consent Decree and requested the district court to rule\n\nthat the school system had achieved unitary status. On April 4,\n\n1990, based on a joint motion filed by United States and the School\n\nBoard, the district court entered an order affirming the parties’\n\nagreement (the 1990 Order).      Jones II, 204 F.R.D. at 98–99.         The\n\n1990 Order provided in pertinent part:\n\n     “(1) Except as specifically set forth in § 7 of the\n          Joint Motion, there are no issues or disputes\n          regarding    successful    compliance   and    full\n          implementation of the 1981 Consent Decree;\n                               * * *\n     (3) The [] Board has within the appropriate parameters\n          met the projected enrollments for all magnet and\n          laboratory schools covered by Part V, Sections D[,\n          termination of jurisdiction over magnet and\n          laboratory schools,] . . .;\n     (4) In accordance with Part V, Sections A-E of the\n          Consent Decree:\n          (i) The Consent Decree is terminated . . . as to\n               magnet schools and laboratory schools covered\n               by Sections D and E, Part V of the Decree, and\n               the United States shall not be entitled to\n               seek any further or additional remedy with\n               respect to any of said magnet schools,\n               laboratory schools, schools north of Caddo\n               Lake, nor with respect to any Mandatory\n               Assignment District [in the decree] . . . .”\n\n     With the entry of the 1990 Order, none of the remaining\n\n“issues   or   disputes   regarding    successful   compliance   and   full\n\nimplementation of the 1981 Consent Decree” involved CMMS, mandatory\n\nstudent assignments, or projected racial enrollments. The portions\n\nof the 1981 decree that the United States insisted, in section 7 of\n\n\n                                      13\n\fthe 1990 Joint Motion, had not been fully implemented as required\n\nwere the following: assignment of principals to schools (under Part\n\nI, Section F, entitled “Faculty and Staff”); establishment of\n\nenhancement programs at remaining one-race schools (under Part II,\n\nSection E, entitled “Remaining One-Race Schools,” relating to\n\nprograms at such schools); and Majority to Minority Transfers\n\n(under Part II, Section F, relating to allowing and encouraging, in\n\nreference to one-race schools, transfers of students from a school\n\nin which the student is in the racial majority to a school in which\n\nthe student would be in the minority).    See Jones II, 204 F.R.D. at\n\n99 n.1.\n\n                d.   Status of the 1981 Consent Decree\n\n      Based on the 1990 Order, the 1981 Consent Decree is no longer\n\napplicable to CMMS and cannot form the justification for the use of\n\nracial classifications in CMMS’s admission policy.        The Consent\n\nDecree clearly contemplated that it could be terminated with\n\nrespect to the magnet schools:\n\n      “Upon meeting the projected enrollments for all magnet\n      and laboratory schools . . ., this Decree shall terminate\n      as to such schools, the Board shall be entitled to an\n      order of the Court so stating, and the United States\n      shall not be entitled to seek any further or additional\n      remedy with respect to such schools.” (emphasis added).\n\nUnder the Consent Decree, the School Board had the obligation to\n\nuse “every reasonable effort” and “its best efforts” to “achieve”\n\nor “attain” the projected racial enrollments for CMMS by the end of\n\nthe   1984–85   school   year,   and   upon   meeting   the   projected\n\n                                  14\n\fenrollments, the Consent Decree was to terminate as to CMMS.                         The\n\nConsent    Decree,    however,       did    not   give    the    School      Board    an\n\nindefinite obligation to maintain the projected racial enrollment\n\nfor CMMS once the decree was terminated as to CMMS.\n\n      Consistent with the provisions of the 1981 Consent Decree, the\n\n1990 Order unambiguously released the magnet schools, including\n\nCMMS, from any further obligations of or under the Consent Decree:\n\n“The []    Board     has    within   the    appropriate        parameters     met    the\n\nprojected enrollments for all magnet and laboratory schools”;10 “The\n\nConsent Decree is terminated . . . as to the magnet schools. . .,\n\nand the United States shall not be entitled to seek any further or\n\nadditional remedy with respect to any of said magnet schools . . .\n\n.”   Therefore, with respect to the 1981 Consent Decree, upon which\n\nthe School Board justifies its racial classification, there is\n\nnothing left regarding CMMS.\n\n      Moreover, the law is clear that the School Board’s obligation\n\nunder the Consent Decree may be reduced or eliminated in some\n\nrespects even if the entire school system is not totally in\n\ncompliance    with    the    Consent   Decree     or     has    not   been   declared\n\nunitary.     In Green v. School Board of New Kent County, 88 S.Ct.\n\n1689 (1968), the Supreme Court “identified various parts of the\n\n\n      10\n         CMMS opened for the 1982–1983 school year and met its projected racial\nenrollment level of at least 35% black students during its first year and three\nout of the first four years. The black student enrollment for the first four\nyears was: 37.3% (1982–1983), 36.1% (1983–1984), 34.4% (1984–1985), 38.8%\n(1985–1986).\n\n                                           15\n\fschool system which, in addition to student attendance patterns,\n\nmust be free from racial discrimination before the mandate of\n\n[Brown v. Board of Education, 74 S.Ct. 686 (1954),] is met:\n\nfaculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and\n\nfacilities.” Freeman v. Pitts, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1443 (1992) (citing\n\nGreen, 88 S.Ct. at 1692).   In Freeman, the Supreme Court held that\n\na “district court need not retain active control over every aspect\n\nof school administration until a school district has demonstrated\n\nunitary status in all facets of its system.”   Freeman, 112 S.Ct. at\n\n1436.\n\n          “We hold that, in the course of supervising\n     desegregation plans, federal courts have the authority to\n     relinquish supervision and control of school districts in\n     incremental stages, before full compliance has been\n     achieved in every area of school operations.        While\n     retaining jurisdiction over the case, the court may\n     determine that it will not order further remedies in\n     areas where the school district is in compliance with the\n     decree. That is to say, upon a finding that a school\n     system subject to a court-supervised desegregation plan\n     is in compliance in some but not all areas, the court in\n     appropriate cases may return control to the school system\n     in those areas where compliance has been achieved,\n     limiting further judicial supervision to operations that\n     are not yet in full compliance with the court decree. In\n     particular, the district court may determine that it will\n     not order further remedies in the area of student\n     assignments where racial imbalance is not traceable, in\n     a proximate way, to constitutional violations.” Id. at\n     1445–46.\n\n     The Supreme Court did recognize that “[t]wo or more Green\n\nfactors may be intertwined . . . in their relation, so that a\n\nconstitutional violation in one area cannot be eliminated unless\n\nthe judicial remedy addresses other matters as well” and that,\n\n                                 16\n\f“[a]s a consequence, a continuing violation in one area may need to\n\nbe addressed by remedies in another.”            Id. at 1449.      Nevertheless,\n\nthe record must demonstrate why a continuing remedy in one area in\n\nwhich the school system was compliant was needed to remedy the\n\nremaining defects:\n\n     “There was no showing that racial balancing was an\n     appropriate mechanism to cure other deficiencies . . . .\n     It is true that the school district was not in compliance\n     with respect to faculty assignments, but the record does\n     not show that student reassignments would be a feasible\n     or practicable way to remedy this defect.” Id.\n\n     A case from the First Circuit, Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d\n\n790 (1st Cir. 1998), illustrates the application of Freeman in a\n\nsituation very similar to the present case.              In a background case\n\nto Wessmann, a district court in 1974 found “the school system as\n\na whole guilty of de jure segregation” and concluded that three\n\nschools operated by the City of Boston, including Boston Latin\n\nSchool (BLS), “were complicit in promoting and maintaining a dual\n\nschool system.”     Id. at 791–92.           The district court, among other\n\nthings, required BLS to ensure that at least 35% of each entering\n\nclass would be made up of black and Hispanic students.                  By 1987,\n\nthe three schools had, “for all practical purposes,” achieved\n\nunitary   status    in   the   area    of    student    assignments;    however,\n\n“comparable improvement had not been accomplished in other areas,\n\nsuch as   faculty    and   staff      integration      and   the   renovation   of\n\nfacilities.”   Id. at 792.      Because of the lack of progress in these\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\fother areas, in 1987 the First Circuit “instructed that federal\n\ncourt   supervision    of   elements    other      than   student    assignment\n\ncontinue.”   Id.   The district court then relinquished control over\n\nstudent assignments, freeing the schools from the requirement to\n\nmaintain the 35% set-aside, but retained active supervision over\n\nother aspects of the school system.          Id.\n\n     Similar to the background situation described in Wessmann, in\n\n1990 the district court relinquished judicial supervision over\n\nprojected racial enrollments at all magnet schools within the Caddo\n\nParish school system by terminating the decree with respect to the\n\nmagnet schools, as allowed by Freeman and by the terms of the 1981\n\nConsent Decree.    While the 1990 Order did not wholly terminate the\n\nentire Consent Decree, none of the remaining issues regarding its\n\nsuccessful compliance and full implementation involved CMMS.                  In\n\nfact, none of the remaining issues—faculty and staff assignments,\n\nenhancing of remaining one-race schools, and majority to minority\n\ntransfers—related      to   meeting    projected     racial   enrollments     or\n\nmandatory    student   assignments      at   any    school    in    the   system.\n\nAccording to the 1990 Order, the School Board had complied with all\n\nstudent assignment and projected enrollment provisions of the\n\nConsent Decree.    Furthermore, we see nothing in the School Board’s\n\nsummary judgment evidence to suggest that continued student racial\n\nbalancing at CMMS is a “feasible or practicable way” to remedy the\n\nremaining deficiencies identified in the 1990 Order. In any event,\n\n\n                                       18\n\fthe Consent Decree stated that the magnet schools were to be\n\nestablished at particular schools “in order to enhance the quality\n\nof education and bring about a greater degree of desegregation at\n\nthose schools,” (emphasis added), not at all schools within the\n\ndistrict.11\n\n      Therefore, based on the 1990 Order, the 1981 Consent Decree is\n\nno longer applicable to CMMS and cannot be used in any sense to\n\njustify the racial quotas and balancing contained in the CMMS\n\nadmission     policy.     As   the   1981   Consent   Decree    has   not   been\n\napplicable to CMMS since 1990, the School Board cannot rely on the\n\nConsent Decree to establish a finding of current effects of past\n\ndiscrimination.     In order to support its actions, the School Board\n\n“must make specific findings, independent of the Decree,” and as\n\nthere are no such findings before us in the record, “we cannot hold\n\n      11\n         The School Board argues that until the school system is declared unitary\nin whole or in part, the School Board is obligated by law to comply with the\nprovisions of the Consent Decree. This is, in essence, a collateral attack on\nthe 1990 Order. Morever, the Board’s argument fails to recognize the holding in\nFreeman:\n      “To say . . . that a school district must meet all six Green factors\n      before the trial court can declare the system unitary and relinquish\n      its control over school attendance zones, and to hold further that\n      racial balancing by all necessary means is required in the interim,\n      is simply to vindicate a legal phrase.          The law is not so\n      formalistic.” Freeman, 112 S.Ct. at 1448–49.\n      Similarly, in finding that the admission policy was justified because of\nthe 1981 Consent Decree, the magistrate judge stated that the 1990 Order “did not\ndeclare expressly that the district was unitary in student attendance patterns.”\nNevertheless, even though the 1990 Order did not use the magic word “unitary”\nwith respect to the magnet schools, that was its effect.          The 1990 Order\nexpressly “terminated” the 1981 consent decree “as to” the “magnet schools” and\ndeclared that all provisions concerning the magnet schools, and concerning all\nstudent assignments and projected racial enrollments, had been fulfilled and that\nthe United States was not entitled to seek further remedies with respect to the\nmagnet schools or any mandatory student assignment provision in the decree. The\n1990 Order did not need to specifically say “unitary” to effectively declare that\nthe magnet schools were outside of the 1981 Consent Decree.\n\n                                       19\n\fthat   [the   School     Board’s   actions]    were    in   furtherance        of   a\n\ncompelling state purpose.”         Police Ass’n of New Orleans Through\n\nCannatella v. City of New Orleans, 100 F.3d 1159, 1169 (5th Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n       Wessmann also illustrates that the School Board cannot rely on\n\nthe 1981 Consent Decree to support its contention that it is\n\nremedying     prior    segregation.     In    Wessman,      after   the   schools\n\ndiscontinued the use of the 35% racial set-aside, they subsequently\n\nadopted a policy that allocated half of the seats of each new class\n\nusing “flexible racial/ethnic guidelines.”             Wessmann, 160 F.3d at\n\n793.    Thereafter, a white student who would have been admitted to\n\nBLS but for the policy that accounted for race, brought suit\n\nagainst the school committee. The district court upheld the policy\n\nin part because it supposedly was aimed at remedying the vestiges\n\nof past discrimination.         Id. at 793–94.        However, on appeal the\n\nFirst Circuit reversed and struck down the policy, rejecting the\n\nexplanation     that    the   policy   redressed      the   vestiges      of   past\n\ndiscrimination.        The school committee was not able to satisfy its\n\nburden of showing a “strong basis in evidence” that the policy\n\nremedied past segregation, id. at 800, in spite of the fact that\n\nthe schools had previously been found guilty of maintaining a dual\n\nschool system and had been required to specifically reserve at\n\nleast 35% of BLS seats to certain minorities.\n\n\n\n\n                                       20\n\f      The School Board relies on the unpublished opinion Bryant v.\n\nCaddo Parish School Board, CV No. 95-0441 (W.D. La. Jan. 3, 1997).\n\nIn Bryant, which likewise involved a white student’s challenge to\n\nthe CMMS admissions criteria, the plaintiffs argued that the 1981\n\nConsent Decree was no longer applicable because of the 1990 Order.12\n\nThe district court rejected the argument, relying on the fact that\n\nthe plaintiff had not established that the entire Consent Decree\n\nhad been complied with and on the fact that the entire school\n\nsystem had not been declared unitary:\n\n      “Bryant fails to mention, however, that this Court did\n      not hold that Part I, Section F-Faculty and Staff; Part\n      II, Section E-Remaining One-Race Schools; and Part II,\n      Section F-Majority to Minority Transfers- of the Consent\n      Order had been fully implemented and complied with.\n      Furthermore, Bryant has failed to produce any evidence\n      demonstrating that the Caddo Parish School system has\n\n\n      12\n         Both the policy in Bryant and in the present case have the same criteria\nto determine qualified applicants and to rank those qualified applicants. The\npolicy in the present case mandates the use of two ranking lists–one for white\nstudents and one for black students, and while there is no indication in Bryant\nthat the policy involved there mandated two separate ranking lists, we\nnevertheless assume that it most likely did: Policy JECC indicates that it was\nadopted February 2, 1983, and amended January 16, 1985, without any indication\nthat its content was any different when Bryant applied to CMMS in 1994 than it\nwas when Hunter applied in 2002.      Also, at oral argument, the School Board\nclaimed that policy in Bryant is the same policy before us now.      If there is any\ndifference between the two cases, it may be with respect to the projected racial\nenrollment requirement—here the racial mix is a requirement, whereas in Bryant\nit was merely a goal. In the present case, the Board is governed by Item No.\n37—adopted after Bryant—requiring CMMS to be within the racial parameters of the\n1981 Consent Decree (50/50, ±15 percentage points). In Bryant, however, the\nracial enrollment goal of 50/50, ±15 percentage points appears to be only a goal.\nNevertheless, regardless of Item No. 37, Policy JECC, the policy presumably in\neffect at the time of Bryant, provides that “vacancies will be filled from the\nrankings in accord with the projected racial enrollments called for in the\nConsent Decree.” While Item No. 37 appears to make the 1981 Consent Decree\nracial enrollment projections a firm requirement for the School Board, it appears\nthat even at the time of Bryant, the admission policy sought to fill vacancies\naccording to the same projections. Therefore, the policy in Bryant appears to\nbe substantially the same as the policy in the present case.\n\n                                        21\n\f     fully implemented and complied with the remaining\n     sections of the Consent Decree. Thus, the Caddo Parish\n     public school system has not been declared unitary and\n     the Consent Decree still applies to the Caddo Parish\n     Schools which, of course, includes [CMMS].” Id.\n\nOn appeal, this court summarily affirmed the district court,\n\nstating only:\n\n     “We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the records\n     excerpts and relevant portions of the record itself. For\n     the reasons stated by the district court in its\n     memorandum ruling and Order filed under date of January\n     3, 1997, we are satisfied that the Summary Judgment\n     granted by the district court in favor of Caddo Parish\n     School Board should be and is now AFFIRMED.” Bryant v.\n     Caddo Parish School Board, No. 97-30135 (5th Cir.\n     September 26, 1997) (per curiam; unpublished).\n\n     We are not bound by our affirmance of the district court in\n\nBryant.    The opinion is not precedential, as it is an unpublished\n\nopinion issued pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5 after January 1,\n\n1996.     Under Rule 47.5.4, the opinion is binding only under the\n\ndoctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, or law of the case,\n\nnone of which apply here.\n\n     While an unpublished opinion may be persuasive under Rule\n\n47.5.4, we are not persuaded by the Bryant affirmance or by the\n\nunderlying district court opinion.    We based our affirmance on the\n\n“reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum ruling,”\n\nwithout providing any independent analysis.    The district court’s\n\none-paragraph discussion of the 1981 Consent Decree in light of the\n\n1990 Order did not address several key points of the analysis: 1)\n\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Freeman that allows a school\n\n\n                                 22\n\fdistrict to be declared unitary in an incremental fashion; 2) the\n\nConsent Decree itself contemplated that the magnet schools would be\n\nreleased from the decree when their related obligations were\n\nimplemented; 3) the purpose of the magnet schools was to “enhance\n\nthe quality of education and bring about a greater degree of\n\ndesegregation at [the schools that were to become the magnet]\n\nschools,” (emphasis added); and 4) there is no clear relationship\n\nbetween the remaining deficiencies outlined in the 1990 Order, none\n\nof which dealt with racial enrollment projections, and racial\n\nbalancing at CMMS.      Therefore, the Bryant case does not influence\n\nour reasoning with respect to the 1990 Order and its effect on the\n\n1981 Consent Decree.13\n\n      The School Board also points to, and the magistrate judge\n\nrelied on, Davis v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, 721 F.2d\n\n1425 (5th Cir. 1983), in which this court upheld an admission\n\npolicy similar to that used by the School Board here.              In Davis,\n\nthe school board operated under a court-approved admission policy\n\naccording to which the board selected applicants to its magnet\n\nschools using two lists, one for white students and one for black\n\n      13\n        Concerning the 1990 Order and its effect on the 1981 Consent Decree, in\n2001 the district court in Jones II commented that the parties seeking to\nintervene at that time were seeking to do so “twenty years after the district\ncourt entered the 1981 Consent Decree, and 11 years after the court granted\nunitary status to the school district.” Jones II, 204 F.R.D. at 100 (emphasis\nadded). The district court then stated that the “only issue remaining before\nthis court is continued compliance with the parameters of the 1990 order.” Id.\nWhile this is not determinative, it does indicate that one previous district\njudge thought, as we hold now, that the 1990 Order did reduce the scope of the\n1981 Consent Decree.\n\n\n                                      23\n\fstudents.   The board was to fill seats from the separate lists to\n\nachieve a racial balance at each magnet school of 60% white\n\nstudents and 40% black students.         If by April 1 of each year the\n\nseats at a magnet school reserved for a particular race had not\n\nbeen filled, those seats could be opened to students of any other\n\nrace.   The district court, however, later modified the admission\n\npolicy directing that white students could not be admitted in any\n\nproportion greater than 60% of the total enrollment.             The school\n\nboard appealed the modification and we affirmed.               Id. at 1440.\n\nDavis is wholly distinguishable from the present case.             In Davis,\n\nthe school board was still under the court’s supervision with\n\nrespect to the admission policy.              Further, almost no time had\n\npassed since the creation of the court’s plan—the plan was designed\n\nto begin in the 1981–1982 school year and was modified in 1982, and\n\nour ruling was issued in 1983.                Id. at 1433–34, 1440.     The\n\nsituation   in   the   present   case    is    significantly   different—the\n\nConsent Decree was issued in 1981, judicial supervision over CMMS\n\nwas withdrawn in 1990, and there have been no subsequent findings\n\nof segregation or vestiges of past segregation or orders requiring\n\nthe continued use of remedial racial classifications. In addition,\n\nin Davis the use of separate lists was explicitly part of the\n\ncourt-approved plan.     In contrast, here the Consent Decree did not\n\nmandate, or even suggest, that the School Board use separate test-\n\nscore ranking lists for blacks and whites; the use of separate\n\n\n                                    24\n\flists is directed by the School Board’s own admission policy.\n\nDavis, therefore, is simply not applicable here.\n\n                  e.     No Other Vestiges of Past Segregation\n\n      There is no evidence in the record of current segregation\n\nwithin   the    school    system    or    at   CMMS   or   vestiges    of   past\n\ndiscrimination.14      The School Board thus fails to show that it has\n\na “‘strong basis in evidence’ showing that a current social ill in\n\n\n\n      14\n         At oral argument, counsel for the School Board suggested two vestiges\nof past segregation: the fact that the school system still has several one-race\nschools and the test-score disparity between white and black students. As this\n“evidence” is not in the record and was suggested for the first time at oral\nargument, it is not properly before us. United States v. Simpson, 334 F.3d 453,\n454 n.1 (5th Cir. 2003).\n      Nevertheless, even if we were to consider the School Board’s suggested\nvestiges, the School Board has not shown that the existence of the one-race\nschools and the test-score gap is traceable to past segregation. Regarding one-\nrace schools, the Supreme Court has declared that “the existence of some small\nnumber of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools within a district is not in\nand of itself the mark of a system that still practices segregation by law.”\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281 (1971). For\ninstance, in Davis we upheld a district court-created plan that left 11 one-race\nelementary schools. Davis, 721 F.2d at 1433. Furthermore, the 1981 Consent\nDecree itself explicitly recognized that the elimination of all one-race schools\nwithin the school system was not practicable: “The parties and the Court\nrecognize that the elimination of all racially identifiable schools in the System\nis impracticable.” “[T]he parties, after exploring all avenues to attempt to\nachieve desegregation in [certain] schools, have determined . . . that there is\nno feasible and practical means of accomplishing desegregation at those schools\nother than the actions [described concerning one-race schools].” “[T]here will\nremain under the provisions of this Decree a number of one-race or predominantly\none-race schools which, for various reasons . . ., it is not practically possible\nto effectively desegregate given the current circumstances existing in Caddo\nParish.” The School Board has not shown in any way, particularly in light of the\nConsent Decree’s language, how the continued existence of one-race schools is\ntraceable to past segregation within the school system.\n      Concerning the test-score gap, the Board has produced no evidence and\nprovided no analysis whatsoever regarding a causal connection between the gap and\npast de jure segregation. As “achievement gap statistics, by themselves, do not\neven eliminate the possibility that they are caused by what the Court terms\n‘societal discrimination,’” Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 803, the mere suggestion that\nthe gap is a vestige of past discrimination is not sufficient. Moreover, it is\nobvious that virtually none of the students entering the eighth (or lower) grade\nfor the 2002-03 school year was or had ever been a student at any school governed\nby the School Board when the 1990 Order was entered.\n\n                                         25\n\ffact has been caused by such conduct.”           Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 800\n\n(quoting City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 109 S.Ct. 706, 725\n\n(1989)).\n\n                  2.    No Other Compelling Interests\n\n      Besides relying on the 1981 Consent Decree, the School Board\n\nhas not attempted to argue, or make any showing, that the racial\n\nclassifications in its admission policy can be justified by some\n\nother compelling governmental interest.           The magistrate judge also\n\nrelied exclusively on the decree to uphold CMMS’s admission policy,\n\nexplicitly stating that it was not deciding, or being asked to\n\ndecide, whether it could constitutionally order the implementation\n\nof the admission policy or whether the policy could withstand a\n\nconstitutional challenge if the purpose was to achieve diversity15\n\nor some similar social goal.\n\n      The School Board’s current policy is essentially a racial\n\nbalancing quota.       The 1981 Consent Decree no longer applies to\n\nCMMS, and racial balancing by itself is not a constitutionally\n\n\n      15\n         The School Board has not claimed that its policy seeks to achieve\ndiversity among the students at CMMS. The School Board has specifically limited\nits justification for the policy to the 1981 Consent Decree and expressly argued,\nin its briefs and at oral argument, that Grutter and Gratz are distinguishable\nand “very different” cases because they dealt with efforts to achieve diversity\nin the student body and not with a desegregation order to remedy past\ndiscrimination.    Moreover, while student body diversity has been held a\ncompelling state interest in the context of a law school, Grutter v. Bollinger,\n123 S.Ct. 2325, 2339 (2003), it is by no means clear that it could be such at or\nbelow the high school level. But see Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle\nSch. Dist. No. 1, 377 F.3d 949, 964 (9th Cir. 2004) (applying Grutter to hold\nthat diversity in the public high school context can be a compelling governmental\ninterest). In any event, the quota system applied here would seem to clearly\nfail to pass muster under Gratz v. Bollinger, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (2003).\n\n\n                                       26\n\fproper reason for employing racial classifications: “[T]he Court\n\nhas consistently held that the Constitution is not violated by\n\nracial imbalance in the schools, without more.” Milliken, 97 S.Ct.\n\nat 2757 n.14.   See also Freeman, 112 S.Ct. at 1447 (“Racial balance\n\nis not to be achieved for its own sake. . . . Once the racial\n\nimbalance due to the de jure violation has been remedied, the\n\nschool district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused\n\nby demographic factors.”).\n\n     The    School     Board    has      failed    to     show     any     compelling\n\ngovernmental    interest        that      it      furthers       by      its        racial\n\nclassification.      The policy is therefore unconstitutional.\n\n     C.     Narrowly Tailored\n\n     Moreover, even if the 1981 Consent Decree were still in some\n\nrespects applicable to CMMS, the School Board’s policy is not\n\nnarrowly    tailored     to    remedy      the    present        effects       of     past\n\nsegregation, the compelling interest allegedly supported by the\n\nConsent Decree.      In the context of remedying past discrimination,\n\na narrowly tailored measure requires that the state actor consider\n\nthe use of other race-neutral means.               Croson, 109 S.Ct. at 729.\n\nFurther, a quota system “cannot be said to be narrowly tailored to\n\nany goal, except perhaps outright racial balancing,” id., and\n\n“[r]acial   balance    is     not   to   be    achieved    for     its    own       sake.”\n\nFreeman, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\f      The School Board’s policy is not narrowly tailored.                “To be\n\nnarrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot use\n\na quota system – it cannot ‘insulat[e] each category of applicants\n\nwith certain desired qualifications from competition with all other\n\napplications.’” Grutter v. Bollinger, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 2342 (2003)\n\n(quoting Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2761\n\n(1978) (Powell, J.)).         Further, there is no evidence that the\n\nSchool Board has considered any race-neutral means which might\n\narguably result in an increase in the percentage of black students\n\nat CMMS.16      Moreover, as the School Board cannot justify its\n\noutright racial balancing absent a showing of current effects of\n\nprior segregation, which it has not done, its use of a racial quota\n\nis improper.     While “the use made of mathematical ratios” as “no\n\nmore than a starting point in the process of shaping a remedy,\n\nrather than an inflexible requirement,” might be appropriate in\n\ncertain contexts,       Swann, 91 S.Ct. at 1267 (emphasis added), the\n\nSchool Board’s use of a racial quota supposedly pursuant to the\n\n1981 Consent Decree but more than twenty years after the signing of\n\nthe decree – and more than a decade after the 1990 Order – is\n\n\n\n\n      16\n        Some examples of race-neutral means that the Board might have considered\ninclude: recruiting highly qualified black students who might not otherwise apply\nto CMMS, employing programs in elementary schools to improve standardized test\nscores for potential but underachieving student applicants, or considering\ncertain characteristics of the applicants’ parents (such as socio-economic\nstatus, educational level, or number of parents in a student’s home).\n\n                                       28\n\fhardly a “starting point” and appears rather to be an improper\n\n“inflexible requirement.”17\n\n      With respect to narrow tailoring, we also observe that the\n\npolicy does not even follow the dictates of the 1981 Consent Decree\n\nitself.    The Consent Decree did not expressly mandate the use of a\n\nrace-conscious admission policy.18          Although the Consent Decree did\n\ngive a projected racial enrollment goal, all the measures that it\n\nspecifically mentioned were race-neutral ones.            The Consent Decree\n\nprovided that the School Board would “establish an aggressive\n\nmagnet     recruitment   program    and     [would]   permit   and   encourage\n\nstudents to attend magnet schools using every reasonable effort to\n\nachieve the projected racial enrollment for each school.” (emphasis\n\nadded).     The School Board was to use its “best efforts to attain\n\nthe projected racial enrollments [for the magnet schools] . . . by\n\n\n\n      17\n         The School Board does not see its use of racial quotas as a starting\npoint and does not appear to have an end in mind. In an interrogatory, the\nCavaliers asked the School Board to describe “any time limitation after which all\nconsideration of race in the admissions policy at [CMMS] . . . will be\ndiscontinued, or any objective, which if attained, would cause all consideration\nof race in the admissions policy at [CMMS] to be discontinued.” In response, the\nSchool Board simply stated that the “current policy will be followed as long as\nthe policy is in effect. Whether the Board in the future may revise the policy\ncalls for speculation.” The School Board’s policy clearly is not a starting\npoint, and the consideration of race is not specifically and carefully limited,\nat least in the temporal respect, to some compelling interest.\n      18\n         The School Board has admitted that the Consent Decree only implicitly\nmandates the use of a race-conscious admission policy.      In response to the\nCavaliers’ request for any evidence that the School Board had received approval\nfrom the district court to use racial classifications, the School Board pointed\nto the 1981 Consent Decree and stated that it “consider[ed] it implicit in this\nDecree that magnet schools, because they do not enroll children on the basis of\nattendance zones, must use race conscious admissions policies in order to meet\nthe required projected racial enrollments, and that race conscious admissions\npolicies are permitted.” (emphasis added).\n\n                                       29\n\fdeveloping attractive programs at [the magnet schools] and by\n\nencouraging students of both races to attend such schools and\n\nbenefit from their programs.” (emphasis added). The Consent Decree\n\nfurther explained that “magnet programs at particular schools may\n\nbe revised in order to effectively provide for the recruitment and\n\nretention of students in the magnet schools and to achieve and\n\nmaintain a desegregated enrollment.” (emphasis added).\n\n      The Consent Decree did not mandate that the School Board\n\nemploy a    separate    list/quota     system    or   any   other   such   race-\n\nconscious policy to arrive at the projected racial enrollment goal.\n\nRather, the School Board was to use every reasonable effort and its\n\nbest efforts to recruit and encourage students and to develop\n\nattractive programs and to revise the programs in order to achieve\n\nand maintain the desired level of desegregation.                    The School\n\nBoard’s use of a racial quota does not constitute any one (or a\n\ncombination) of the actions expressly mandated by the Consent\n\nDecree. Moreover, the Consent Decree itself wholly terminated more\n\nthan a decade ago as to the magnet schools.19\n\n\n      19\n         A brief response to the dissent.\n      The dissent relies on the language in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board\nof Education, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276 (1971), and the similar language in the\ncompanion case of North Carolina State Board of Education v. Swann, 91 S.Ct.\n1284, 1286 (1971), to the effect that “[s]chool authorities . . . might well\nconclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic\nsociety each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students\nreflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. . . . to do this is within\nthe broad discretionary powers of school authorities . . .”. This language is\nthe purest passing dicta. No such issue was even arguably before the Court or\npresented by the facts of either case; no authority whatever, legal or otherwise,\nis cited in support; and the statements made do not form any link in the chain\nof reasoning by which the Court arrived at the holdings it made in those cases.\n\n                                       30\n\fMoreover, the cited language in Swann – particularly as applied to race based\nmagnet school admissions – has clearly been superceded by that of Adarand\nContractors, Inc. v. Pena, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 2111 (1995), and Gratz v. Bollinger,\n123 S.Ct. 2411 (2003), the court stating in Gratz: “It is by now well established\nthat ‘all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause\nmust be strictly scrutinized.’” Id. at 2427 (emphasis added; quoting Adarand, 115\nS.Ct. at 2097). The dissent’s citation in this connection of Washington v.\nSeattle School District No. 1, 102 S.Ct. 3187 (1982), is similarly unpersuasive;\nindeed there the Court noted that “Appellants and the United States do not\nchallenge the propriety of race-conscious student assignments for the purpose of\nachieving integration, even absent a finding of prior de jure segregation. We\ntherefore do not specifically pass on that issue.” Id. at 3196 n. 15.\n      Gratz applied strict scrutiny notwithstanding the presence of a compelling\nstate interest. Even prior to Gratz, lower courts had applied strict scrutiny\nto use by educational authorities of race based preferences as remedial measures\nfor past discrimination. See, e.g., Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 152-53\n(4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 2001 (1995). See also Johnson v. Board\nof Regents, 263 F.3d 1234, 1265 (11th Cir. 2001); Eisenberg v. Montgomery County\nPublic Schools, 197 F.3d 123, 128-29 (4th Cir. 1999); cf. Police Ass’n of New\nOrleans v. City of New Orleans, 100 F.3d 1159, 1169 (5th Cir. 1996) (“Even\nassuming that the promotions were made to remedy specific past discrimination,\nthe actions before us were not narrowly tailored, as required” by strict\nscrutiny). Indeed, the dissent seems to ultimately recognize all this (as well\nas the wholly unpersuasive nature in this context of the Swann passing dicta it\nquotes).\n      The dissent errs in reliance on the holding in Belk v. Charlotte-\nMecklenberg Board of Education, 269 F.3d 305 (4th Cir. 2001), exonerating the\nschool board from damages for race-based admissions to a magnet school prior to\nthe district court’s dismissal of the underlying decree on the basis that the\ndistrict was unitary. In Belk, unlike the situation here, there had been no\nprior order specifically removing the magnet schools from the extant\ndesegregation orders. Of the six judges in Belk who voted for this holding (five\njudges would have held the board liable), four were of the view that the prior\norders, extant at the time for which damages were sought, “specifically\nauthorized the use of fixed ratios based on race in assigning students to magnet\nschools.” Id. at 408 (opinion of Judge Motz) (and it is not clear that the other\ntwo judges in the six judge majority were not of the same view; see id. at 353-\n56, opinion of Chief Judge Wilkinson). Belk might be analogous to this case if\nthis case involved a claim for denial of access to CMMS in, say, 1986. Rather,\nthis case involves denial of access to CMMS more than a decade after the 1990\norder entirely removing it from the only extant court order, and is hence\nanalogous to Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir. 1998), cited with\napparent approval in Judge Motz’s Belk opinion (269 F.3d at 410).\n      Moreover, in view of the wording of the 1990 order – which expressly\n“terminated” the 1981 order (the only extant desegregation related order) “as to\n[the] magnet schools” and provided “the United States shall not be entitled to\nseek any further or additional remedy with respect to any of said magnet\nschools,” it is wholly clear that there was no reasonable possibility whatever\nthat the school board could be exposed to sanctions for post-1990 abandonment of\nits rigid racial quota magnet school admissions policy (which itself was never\nmandated by the 1981 decree). Finally, it is manifestly unfair and illogical to\nplace on the plaintiffs the burden to prove that there was no conceivable\njustification for the board’s use, over a decade after the 1990 order, of a rigid\n\n                                       31\n\f                                 Conclusion\n\n      Based on the foregoing, we REVERSE and REMAND for further\n\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                          REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\nracial quota admissions system at CMMS, when the board had all the relevant data\nand resources but defended its action below only on the manifestly erroneous\nground of compliance with the 1981 decree (see note 8 and accompanying test\nsupra).\n\n\n\n                                      32\n\fWIENER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       The brooding omnipresence that overarches the panel majority’s\n\nreversal of the district court is the unarticulated premise ——\n\nfatally flawed, I submit —— that the trial court’s partial release\n\nof the consent decree vis-à-vis Caddo Magnet School, ipso facto\n\nvoided the very programs and policies long employed by the school\n\ndistrict to achieve that partial release.                As I shall explain more\n\nfully below, I am compelled, with my utmost respect, to dissent.\n\n       If the school board had unilaterally adopted its racial-quota\n\nadmissions policy for magnet schools anew —— after the Caddo Parish\n\nSchool District had been declared unitary (which it has not) or\n\neven after the court had ceased its supervision of the particular\n\nmagnet school’s student admissions policy under the consent decree\n\n(which it has) —— I would likely have no concerns about joining the\n\nmajority’s opinion.             But that is not our case and thus not the\n\nframework within which we must review it. Rather than a brand-new,\n\npost   hoc    admissions        policy,    the   plan   that     we   must    test   for\n\nconstitutionality          is   (1)   a   longstanding    race-based         admissions\n\npolicy,      (2)   which    has    been    “on   the    books”    and   consistently\n\nadministered for many years, (3) pursuant to an existing consent\n\ndecree, (4) as part and parcel of the school board’s comprehensive\n\nand continuing efforts, specifically to comply with the district\n\ncourt’s mandate to achieve a 50/50 ratio in the Magnet Schools and\n\ngenerally to eradicate all vestiges of past segregation.                       When we\n\nreview the case in this framework —— as we must —— the school\n\fboard’s      discretionary      decision        to   retain     its    magnet     school\n\nadmissions policy as an integral tool in the Board’s ongoing\n\nstruggle to achieve its court-ordered, yet-unrealized goal of total\n\ndesegregation easily passes our scrutiny.\n\n      Cessation of court supervision of the magnet school aspect of\n\nthe consent decree is not the equivalent of a court declaration\n\nthat the persistent vestiges of more than a century of school\n\nsegregation have ceased to plague a substantial majority of Caddo’s\n\nminority school students.              Although the Supreme Court allows\n\ndistrict courts to discontinue supervision over some (but less than\n\nall) aspects of plans to achieve unitary status in historically\n\nsegregated school districts, the Court has never ruled that such a\n\npartial release from supervision forecloses a school district’s\n\noption to continue using the ensconced race-conscious policies that\n\nenabled it to achieve and maintain such status.                    To the contrary,\n\nthe Court has consistently emphasized the importance of affording\n\nschool districts maximum discretion and control over local schools,\n\nparticularly       with     respect   to   remedying      the     vestiges       of   past\n\nsegregation.20         In    fact,    it   has       explicitly       endorsed    school\n\ndistricts’ use of race-conscious policies.21\n\n\n      20\n         See, e.g., Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 490 (1992) (citing Dayton Bd.\nof Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 410 (1977)). See also Bush v. Orleans Parish\nSch. Bd., 308 F.2d 491, 501 (5th Cir. 1962) (“When a case involves the\nadministration of a state’s schools, as federal judges, we try to sit on our\nhands.”)\n      21\n           See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 16\n(1971).\n\n                                           34\n\f     It is true, as the majority points out, that, as a general\n\nrule, Supreme Court precedent requires us to scrutinize race-\n\nconscious government policies strictly.    Nevertheless, race-based\n\nfeatures of school districts’ desegregation plans enacted pursuant\n\nto court order, such as the one here at issue, are afforded a\n\nspecial presumption that they address a compelling state interest\n\n—— remedying the effects of past segregation —— over and above the\n\ngeneral deference that we accord local school districts’ efforts to\n\ncomply with each aspect of court-ordered desegregation plans.\n\nHere, the 1990 consent decree expressly released Caddo Middle\n\nMagnet School (“Caddo Magnet”) from further court supervision.   To\n\nthis day, however, the school district as a whole remains bound\n\nunder the consent decree, and the Board risks court sanctions if it\n\ndoes not make bona fide efforts to fulfill all its obligations\n\nunder the order.   If, therefore, we were to prohibit the Board’s\n\ncontinued use of those race-conscious policies that have long been\n\nin place, and at the same time were to threaten sanctions if the\n\nboard does not continue its efforts to remedy the effects of past\n\nracial discrimination, we would be putting the Board in a classic\n\n“Catch-22” situation.      In consequence, our review of the Caddo\n\nMagnet admissions policy must take into account the timing and\n\nhistory of that policy and the circumstances under which the school\n\ndistrict operates —— and defer to local authority to the maximum\n\nextent of our authority.\n\nPartial Unitary Status\n\n                                  35\n\f       The panel majority cites no Supreme Court pronouncements, (and\n\nI have found none) on the effect that a district court’s declaring\n\na school district “partially unitary” has on a school board’s\n\ncontinued use of policies validly enacted and continually applied\n\nin compliance with a consent decree.                      Despite the majority’s\n\nreliance on Freeman v. Pitts, that case addresses the equitable\n\npower of district courts to supervise continuing desegregation\n\nefforts, not the discretion of school boards to decide how to\n\nimplement these efforts.             The Freeman Court permitted district\n\ncourts to relinquish control over local school districts gradually\n\nby declaring them unitary in increments, i.e., to release districts\n\nfrom    the     obligation    to   continue       some    discrete    desegregation\n\npolicies       while    continuing      to    address     remaining    vestiges     of\n\ndiscrimination in other areas.22              Significantly, this decision did\n\nnothing to diminish either the discretion of school districts to\n\ncontinue programs previously enacted pursuant to a consent decree\n\nor the deference we must afford to the districts’ exercise of that\n\ndiscretion.23         In fact, when the Court has taken up the issue of\n\nschool       board    discretion   to    consider        race   in   implementing   a\n\ndesegregation policy, it has acknowledged that board discretion to\n\nimplement such policies exceeds the equitable power of the courts\n\nto order them to do so.\n\n\n\n       22\n            Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 491-2 (1992).\n       23\n            See id.\n\n                                             36\n\fSchool Board Discretion and the Use of Race\n\n      The    Supreme   Court’s   1971    Swann   decision    highlighted     the\n\nexpansive     discretionary power of school officials to remedy past\n\nsegregation and contrasted it with the equitable powers of the\n\ncourts:\n\n           School authorities are traditionally charged with\n           broad power to formulate and implement educational\n           policy and might well conclude, for example, that\n           in order to prepare students to live in a\n           pluralistic society each school should have a\n           prescribed ratio of Negro to white students\n           reflecting the proportion for the district as a\n           whole.   To do this as an educational policy is\n           within the broad discretionary powers of school\n           authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional\n           violation, however, that would not be within the\n           authority of a federal court.24\n\n\n      24\n         Swann, 402 U.S. at 16.     The majority refers to this passage as \"the\npurest passing dicta\" and states that it forms no link in the chain of reasoning\nby which the Court arrived at its holding. I do not cite this language as the\nholding but for the same reason the Supreme Court included it: as an example of\nthe contrasting powers of the courts and of local school districts. For this\nreason, I must also take exception to the charge that this language played no\nrole in the reasoning of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg decision.        This opinion\naddressed the equitable power of district courts to order school districts to\ninstitute a variety of programs to address past segregation, and made clear that\nthis equitable power does not reach as far as the inherent power of school\nauthorities.   Certainly, language comparing courts' power to that of school\nauthorities plays a role in the Court's effort to define the reach of district\ncourt's authority. I agree that this language was not central to the North\nCarolina State Bd. of Educ. v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43 (1971) decision, and\naccordingly do not cite that case as an example of the expansive power of school\nauthorities. Despite these observations, —— that the quoted language did not\nfigure in the reasoning of the North Carolina decision or the ultimate holding\nof the Charlotte-Mecklenburg opinion —— unlike the majority, I cannot imagine\nthat a unanimous Court would unequivocally state —— twice —— that school\ndistricts have plenary power to institute race-conscious admissions program if\nit did not mean that school districts have this kind of authority. The language\nfrom Seattle County Sch. Dist. No. 1. v. Washington, 458 U.S. 457 (1982) and\nBustrop, Inc. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Los Angeles, 439 U.S. 1380 (1978), which\nI have cited below, only reinforces my point that the Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly referred to the expansive power of local school authorities, and that\nwe therefore owe a measure of deference to home-grown, race-conscious admissions\nplans when enacted pursuant to a consent decree. Inasmuch as the Supreme Court\nhas never stated, even in dicta, what the majority holds, I do not think that\nthis point undermines my analysis of the case.\n\n                                        37\n\fIn this decision and others, the Court endorsed local discretion to\n\nuse racial balancing as a means of correcting inequities caused by\n\nde jure segregation, and it has never reversed itself on this\n\nissue.25     In Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, the Court\n\nstruck down a citizen initiative enacted to prevent local school\n\ndistricts      from   implementing      race-based     student    assignments    to\n\nachieve formal racial balance goals.26                 The Court held that the\n\ncitizen initiative violated the Equal Protection Clause because it\n\nforbade busing only for the purpose of achieving racial balancing\n\nin the schools and added: “It is undeniable that busing for\n\nintegration —— particularly when ordered by a federal court —— now\n\nengenders considerabl[e] . . . controversy. . .But in the absence\n\nof a constitutional violation, the desirability and efficacy of\n\nschool      desegregation    are      matters   to    be   resolved   through   the\n\npolitical      process.”27       In    fact,    the   Seattle    School   District\n\ndecision, along with then-Justice Rehnquist’s decision in Bustrop,\n\nInc. v. Board of Education of City of Los Angeles, upheld state\n\ndecisions to assign students based on race despite the absence of\n\n\n\n\n      25\n         See id.

The Freeman Court explained that\n\ncourts should withdraw supervision of school districts as quickly\n\nas possible because “local autonomy of school districts is a vital\n\nnational      tradition.”29         Courts    have   likewise   emphasized   the\n\nimportance of maximum local responsibility for crafting integration\n\nstrategies.30      As noted above, the Swann Court expressly approved\n\na school district’s discretion to use a prescribed racial ratio to\n\nthis end, even though it expressed doubt whether a federal court\n\ncould order the district to do the same.31\n\nStrict Scrutiny\n\n\n      28\n         Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. at 474 (assuming that school board had\nthe power to order race-based student assignment and busing, even though school\nsystem was not under court order to desegregate); Bustrop, 439 U.S. at\n1383(upholding California state courts’ desegregation order, including extensive\nbusing and race-based school assignments, as not “required” but certainly\n“permitted” by the U.S. Constitution).

Compelling State Interest\n\n      It is well established that remedying the present effects of\n\npast discrimination is a compelling state interest.33                      As the panel\n\nmajority notes, Caddo Parish School District has been previously\n\nadjudged dual, i.e., guilty of discrimination.                           The continued\n\nexistence of a consent decree imposed pursuant to a judicial\n\nfinding of past de jure segregation, even if now only partially\n\nenforceable, is nonetheless prima facie evidence of the continued\n\nexistence of the effects of past discrimination.                       This is so for\n\nseveral reasons, even with respect to a consent decree that remains\n\nonly partially in effect.\n\n\n\n\n      32\n         Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326 (2003);               Croson v. City of\nRichmond, 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989).\n      33\n         Dallas Fire Fighters Ass’n v. City of Dallas, 150 F.3d 438, 441 (5th\nCir. 1998).\n\n                                             40\n\f      First, a formerly dual school district is under a continuing\n\nduty to “take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a\n\nunitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated\n\nroot and branch.”34         Persons subject to such an injunctive decree\n\nof a court of competent jurisdiction are expected to obey that\n\norder until it is modified or reversed.35               This holds true even if\n\nthe   order      compels   violation     of     another     statute       ——    or    the\n\nConstitution for that matter.36               Declaration of partial unitary\n\nstatus cannot be read to modify, much less repeal, the substantive\n\nelements of the order such that the school district is no longer\n\nrequired to take all efforts to comply with it, even if those\n\nefforts might otherwise violate the law.\n\n      Second, school districts under court order to remedy past\n\nsegregation      should    not   first   be    forced     to    consider       race   and\n\nundertake race-conscious policies to the point of achieving partial\n\nunitary status, only to be forced at that time either to abandon\n\nthese policies immediately or to conduct extensive studies to prove\n\na direct correlation between the policy and some aspect of their\n\nviolation       despite    potential     liability        for     their     remaining\n\nobligations.       The Supreme Court has observed that the indicia by\n\n\n\n      34\n           Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38 (1968).\n      35\n         GTE Sylvania, Inc. v.

Narrowly Tailored\n\n      The Caddo Magnet policy was validly enacted, i.e., narrowly\n\ntailored to achieve the goals of the consent decree, and it\n\ncontinues to meet the narrow tailoring requirement, even under the\n\n\n\n      37\n           Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 497 (1992).\n      38\n        The majority states that it would be “manifestly unfair and illogical”\nto require the plaintiffs to prove that the Caddo Magnet admissions policy was\nunjustified more than a decade after the 1990 order. On the contrary, I find it\nunfair and illogical that any plaintiff seeking admission to a magnet school that\nhas as the very reason for its existence the court-ordered effort to desegregate\nCaddo Parish Schools, may force the Board to prove, as many times as there are\nplaintiffs, the justification for its policy while the district as a whole\nremains subject to court order. The fair thing to do, I believe, is to allow the\ndistrict the presumption that its policy addresses a compelling state interest,\nat least until the district as a whole is no longer subject to court order.\n\n                                        42\n\fpartial consent decree.         Under the circumstances of this case,\n\nviz., a school district’s complying with the court’s order to\n\nremedy a past constitutional violation by, inter alia, achieving a\n\n50/50 black-white student body in its magnet schools, we should\n\nview with considerable deference the continuation of any policy\n\npreviously enacted and unswervingly administered —— under years of\n\ncourt observation —— to bring the school district into compliance\n\nwith the court order.39\n\n      As recently as 2001, the Fourth Circuit in Belk v. Charlotte-\n\nMecklenburg Board of Education employed a “deferential” brand of\n\nstrict scrutiny when it held that a similar race-based admissions\n\nformula for magnet schools did not violate the Constitution,\n\nbecause it had been implemented pursuant to a consent decree and\n\nhad been sufficiently narrowly-tailored to fulfill the Board’s\n\ncourt-ordered     obligations.40        The   Belk    court     considered    an\n\nadmissions    lottery    that    allocated    spots    in   a   magnet   school\n\n\n\n      39\n        Some deference to the decisions of educational policy-makers, even when\nthe court is strictly scrutinizing voluntarily-enacted race-conscious policies,\nis appropriate. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 329 (2003) (“Our holding\ntoday is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a\nuniversity’s academic decisions, within constitutionally-prescribed limits.”).\n      40\n         Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 269 F.3d 305, 354, 401 (4th\nCir. 2001). The majority takes issue with my reliance on Belk, arguing that this\ncase is inapposite because there was no prior order removing magnet schools from\nthe extant desegregation orders. My reason for relying on Belk, however, is to\ncounter the majority's holding that the Caddo Middle Magnet admissions policy was\nnot narrowly tailored at the time of its promulgation. Other considerations,\nsuch as our deference to school board authority, the school board's continuing\nduty to comply with its consent decree, and the use of race-conscious admissions\npolicies at magnet schools to prevent them from undermining desegregation in the\nrest of the district —— considerations to which the majority does not respond ——\nsupport a holding that the policy continues to be narrowly tailored.\n\n                                       43\n\faccording to race.41       The Charlotte-Mecklenburg School district had\n\ncreated separate lotteries for black and non-black students in an\n\neffort to achieve racial balance in its magnet schools.                First, if\n\na sufficient number of children of either race did not fill the\n\nquotas     for    the   children’s    respective   races,     the   Board   would\n\nactively recruit children of the opposite race despite lengthy\n\nwaiting lists for “majority” race spots.42           But then, if the Board\n\ncould not successfully recruit enough children of the targeted\n\nrace, the remaining open spots usually went unfilled.43               The Fourth\n\nCircuit concluded in two separate opinions that the Board’s policy\n\nsurvived        constitutional   scrutiny,   despite    the    fact    that   the\n\nrelevant court order did not require the school district to use a\n\nrace-based admissions policy.44\n\n     Four appellate judges held that the underlying court order’s\n\nbroad language commanding the district to take “whatever steps\n\nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system,” together with\n\nthe school district’s discretion to maintain control over the\n\nracial composition of the schools, justified use of a quota.45\n\nChief Judge Wilkinson, along with Judge Niemeyer, expressed strong\n\ndisapproval of the use of quotas and doubted that the Board’s\n\n     41\n          Belk, 269 F.3d at 316-37.\n     42\n          Id.\n     43\n          Id.\n     44\n          Id. at 311.\n     45\n          Belk, 269 F.3d at 401 (King, J. and Motz, J., concurring).\n\n                                        44\n\fpolicy would survive if it were enacted voluntarily, but reasoned\n\nthat the school district was nevertheless entitled to flexibility\n\nin how it complied with a court order:\n\n          It is true that in the early 1990's, the school\n          board in its magnet program eagerly accepted the\n          courts’   invitation   to   rely   upon   numerical\n          benchmarks.    I believe, however, that it is\n          necessary to afford a school board some latitude in\n          attempting to meet its desegregative obligations if\n          we are not to undermine the rule of law.      To do\n          otherwise leaves the Board between a rock and a\n          hard place. Namely, if the school board fails to\n          carry out the court desegregation order, it can be\n          cited for contempt or held not to have achieved\n          unitariness. But if the Board acts aggressively to\n          implement the court order, it risks facing judicial\n          condemnation and the threat of litigation on the\n          grounds that it was acting ultra vires. This is not\n          the kind of quandary into which we should force\n          institutions that are, for better or worse, under\n          judicial decree.46\n\n     We know that here, as in Belk, the district court’s 1990\n\nconsent decree did not mandate the precise quota policy here at\n\nissue, but broadly commanded Caddo Parish School Board to make\n\n“reasonable efforts” to recruit black students to its magnet\n\nschools.     In so doing, however, the court did specifically decree\n\nthat the targeted black-white enrollment ratio for the school\n\nshould be 50/50, adding that this projected enrollment would be\n\ndeemed satisfied if actual enrollment at Caddo Magnet was within\n\nplus or minus fifteen percentage points of the ratio mandated by\n\nthe court for that school.          Although the consent decree did not\n\nexplicitly     order   Caddo    Magnet    to   use   a   race-conscious   quota\n\n     46\n          Belk, 269 F.3d at 354. (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring).\n\n                                         45\n\fadmissions policy, it is indisputable that, given (1) the court’s\n\nconstitutional mandate for the Board to take whatever steps were\n\nnecessary to fulfill its obligations, and (2) the Supreme Court’s\n\nprior approval of quite similar race-conscious admissions policies,\n\nthis was a reasonable and constitutionally-acceptable means for the\n\nBoard to initiate and continue in its efforts to meet and maintain\n\nits court-ordered enrollment goals.47          Like the Belk policy, the\n\nCaddo Magnet policy was validly enacted as a narrowly tailored\n\nmeans of achieving the goals set forth in the consent decree.\n\n      Our own precedent supports affirming the district court’s\n\nruling that upholds the continued viability of Caddo’s magnet\n\nschool admissions policy.

East Baton Rouge Parish School\n\nBoard, for example, is apposite.48            Although, unlike the Caddo\n\nboard, the Baton Rouge School Board was still under court order\n\nwith respect to its magnet school admission policy, and although\n\nthe time frame between the enactment of the decree and our review\n\nwas narrower, the gravamen of our holding the Baton Rouge magnet\n\nschools admissions policy viable was that the quota would prevent\n\nthe magnet schools from undermining desegregation in the parish as\n\n\n\n\n      47\n         See Green v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38\n(1968) (holding that school boards previously operating state-compelled dual\nsystems were “clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps\nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system); Duvall County Sch.

Caddo Parish School Board,50\n\nour earlier decision affirming the Western District of Louisiana’s\n\nupholding       of   the   self-same    Caddo       Middle   Magnet   admissions\n\npolicy, is unpersuasive.           Regarding the panel majority’s first\n\nconcern —— that the Bryant district court did not address Freeman\n\n—— I have already noted that Freeman only spoke to the district\n\ncourt’s authority to relinquish control in an incremental fashion;\n\nit said nothing about the effect of partial unitary status on a\n\nschool district’s power to craft its own policy.51\n\n      The majority’s second concern —— that the consent decree\n\nitself contemplated that the magnet schools would be released from\n\nthe decree after fulfilling their obligations —— also speaks to the\n\ndiscretionary authority of the school district to change the\n\nadmissions policy when and if it determines that it is proper to do\n\n\n\n\n      49\n         Id. at 1440.

It does not speak to any obligation to discontinue the policy,\n\nipso facto, immediately on release from court supervision.\n\n     As regards the majority’s third concern, it is true that the\n\nstated purpose of creating and operating magnet schools was to\n\nenhance the quality of education imparted to qualified students at\n\nthose schools.       We recognized in Davis, however, that a primary\n\npurpose of racial quotas for magnet school admissions is to ensure\n\nthat “voluntary attendance schools not work to undermine the\n\nprogress of desegregation in the parish.”52\n\n     As     for   the   majority’s    belief    that   there    is   no   clear\n\nrelationship between the remaining deficiencies in the Caddo Parish\n\nSchool system and racial balancing at Caddo Magnet, the foregoing\n\nquotation from Davis clearly identifies a nexus between admissions\n\npolicies at magnet schools and enrollment throughout a district.\n\nAlthough the Board no longer remains under court supervision with\n\nrespect to racial enrollment projections, it does remain under\n\ncourt order with respect to one-race schools and majority-minority\n\ntransfers. Even if here the Davis nexus is slightly attenuated, it\n\nis not unreasonable to deduce that abolishing the magnet school\n\nadmissions policy would likely “undermine” continuing efforts to\n\nremedy the broader problem of one-race schools.                Freeman itself\n\nacknowledged that racial balancing in student assignments may be a\n\nlegitimate means to correct inequities elsewhere in a school system\n\n\n\n     52\n          Davis, 721 F.2d at 1440(emphasis added).\n\n                                       48\n\fthat were also caused by a constitutional violation.53             Eliminating\n\nall vestiges of prior segregation remains a court-ordered goal for\n\nthe Board.\n\n      In the universe of narrow tailoring, magnet schools have been\n\nrecognized by courts time and again as an effective and unobtrusive\n\nmeans for school districts to remedy vestigial effects of past\n\nsegregation.54      Congress itself has extolled the virtues of magnet\n\nschools as a means “to continue to desegregate and diversify\n\nschools . . . recognizing that segregation exists between minority\n\nand nonminority students . . [and that] [d]esegregation efforts\n\nthrough magnet school programs are a significant part of our\n\nNation’s effort to achieve voluntary desegregation. . .” in its\n\nMagnet Schools Assistance Program.55          And, although Caddo Parish’s\n\npartial unitary status includes Caddo Middle Magnet, the district\n\nas a whole has not been declared unitary as to remaining one-race\n\nschools, majority-to-minority transfers, and staffing. Even though\n\n\n\n      53\n         Freeman, 503 U.S. at 497. The Freeman court ultimately found that there\nhad been no showing that racial balancing was an appropriate mechanism to cure\nother deficiencies in the school system, but it acknowledged that the district\ncourt did not make specific findings and conclusions on that issue and remanded\nfor further proceedings. Id. at 498. Further, the Freeman decision did not\nimplicate the school board’s discretion to use racial balancing to cure other\ndeficiencies, but only the equitable power of the district court to order the\nBoard to do so. See id. Finally, the issue in Freeman was whether race-based\nstudent assignments could remedy problems with faculty assignments, whereas Caddo\nParish has not achieved unitary status in two other areas, including one-race\nschools and majority-to-minority transfers. Id.\n      54\n         See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 272, 287-88 (1977); Belk, 269\nF.3d at 355 (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring) (“Magnet schools are a widely used\ndesegregation device.”).\n      55\n           20 U.S.C. § 7231 (2002).\n\n                                       49\n\fCaddo’s magnet schools are no longer compelled to enroll majority\n\nand minority students according to the flexible ratio at issue,\n\nthey were created, and continue to be used, “to enhance the quality\n\nof education and bring about a greater degree of desegregation.”56\n\nThe magnet school admissions policy certainly “fits” this                goal.\n\nConclusion\n\n     The admissions policy at Caddo Parish was validly enacted to\n\nserve a compelling state interest and was narrowly tailored to\n\nachieve that interest, pursuant to a valid consent decree.                    The\n\nfact that the district court might no longer threaten the school\n\ndistrict with sanctions if the magnet schools do not meet their\n\nprojected     enrollments     does    not     mean   that   Caddo   Parish   must\n\nimmediately scrap the race-based admissions policy for its magnet\n\nschools as part of its broader plan to desegregate.                 The Supreme\n\nCourt has never spoken to the effect of partial unitary status on\n\nexisting aspects and policies of the desegregation plan of an\n\nextant consent decree, but has emphasized the breadth of school\n\ndistrict discretion and the importance of local control over\n\nschools.      Consequently, our deference to a locally-accountable\n\nschool board’s decision to continue the use of a race-conscious\n\nadmissions policy of which the supervising court was obviously\n\naware for as long as it              takes to eradicate the vestiges of\n\n\n\n\n     56\n          1981 Caddo Parish Consent Decree.\n\n                                        50\n\fsegregation is legally defensible despite the anathema of racial\n\nquotas generally.\n\n      Indeed,     Supreme         Court   precedent,          such    as    Seattle       School\n\nDistrict    and      Bustrop,        indicates         that    the    Court       views     even\n\nvoluntarily-adopted race-conscious policies with a substantial\n\ndegree of tolerance.              We need not go that far, but neither should\n\nwe   retrench     on   Court       precedent          by   unduly    restricting          school\n\ndistricts, especially those that continue to operate under court\n\norder.     Our review of the instant policy should be considerably\n\nmore deferential than the strictest of strict scrutiny, keeping in\n\nmind that the entire district remains under court order and that\n\npartial cessation of court supervision of this facet of magnet\n\nschool   admissions          is    not    the    equivalent          of    terminating        the\n\ncontinuing presumption of deference to school boards by the courts.\n\n      I end where I began.                 If this Caddo Magnet racial-quota\n\nadmissions policy were enacted unilaterally by the Board today,\n\nafter the court has ceased supervision of the magnet schools, I\n\ncould go along with the majority’s strict scrutiny analysis and\n\nrejection of the quota system.                   But inasmuch as that policy was\n\nenacted pursuant to court order and has been in place for years\n\nunder    that   order        ——    with   court        scrutiny      and        without   court\n\ndisapproval     ——     and    the    Board       is    still    hard       at    the   task    of\n\neradicating the pernicious effects of de jure segregation, I am\n\nconvinced that the test employed in the majority’s opinion is\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\finappositely   stringent   and    thus,   I   respectfully   submit,\n\ninapplicable in this framework.\n\n\n\n\n                                  52\n\f",

His application\n\nwas denied because his achievement test score was not high enough\n\nfor a white student applicant, although it was high enough for a\n\nblack student applicant.         The Cavaliers claim that but for a race-\n\nconscious admission policy, Hunter would have been admitted to\n\nCMMS.    The School Board has not denied this.\n\n       The School Board has admitted that its admission policy for\n\nCMMS    does   employ   racial    classifications     in   order   to   meet   a\n\nparticular racial balance at CMMS.         The procedure for admission to\n\nCMMS is contained in School Board Policy JECC.                To qualify for\n\nadmission to CMMS, an applicant must: 1) have high motivation\n\ntoward excellence, as evidenced by consistent achievement and\n\nacceptable behavior; 2) be performing on grade level or better;\n\n3) have a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or better in reading and\n\n      1\n        On this appeal, as throughout the proceedings in the district court, the\nCavaliers proceed pro se.\n\n                                       2\n\fmath       and   2.5    or   better   overall;   and   4)    have   95%   or   better\n\nattendance.            In addition, the student must take a standardized\n\nachievement        test,     the   California    Achievement     Test     (CAT),   for\n\nranking purposes.2\n\n       After the initial qualifications are taken into account, the\n\nnumber of qualified applicants usually far exceeds the number of\n\navailable openings.            To determine which students will be offered\n\nadmission, CMMS gives priority to qualified siblings of students\n\nwho also attend CMMS and to black students who would otherwise\n\nattend a school with over 90% black student enrollment.                    CMMS then\n\nranks the remaining qualified applicants based on their CAT test\n\nscore.       Regarding these latter rankings, the policy states that\n\nCMMS “will maintain a list of rankings for black students and a\n\nlist of rankings for white students.”                  The vacancies are then\n\nfilled so that CMMS will have a racial mix of 50% white and 50%\n\nblack, plus or minus 15 percentage points.3                 CMMS accepts qualified\n\napplicants of any race subject to the number of openings available\n\nby race, according to the required racial mix, and no applicant of\n\nany race who does not meet the initial admission requirements is\n\naccepted.\n\n\n\n      2\n        The policy also has two nonacademic requirements: the students must have\nparental permission and support and be in good health or under a doctor’s care.\n       3\n        In 2001, the Board approved Item No. 37, which required CMMS enrollment\nto be within the parameters of a consent decree entered in 1981, discussed infra.\nThe consent decree gave a projected racial enrollment for CMMS of 50%\nblack/white, plus or minus 15 percentage points.\n\n                                           3\n\f      Hunter met the initial admission requirements for entrance\n\ninto CMMS for the 2002–2003 school year.         However, based on his CAT\n\ntest score, and due to the number of slots available for white\n\nstudents, he was not admitted.\n\n      For the 2002–2003 school year at CMMS, the lowest CAT test\n\nscore for a nonsibling white applicant given admission to the sixth\n\ngrade was 142; the lowest CAT test score for a nonsibling black\n\napplicant given admission was 117.           Hunter’s CAT test score was\n\n140. There were seven nonsibling white applicants not selected for\n\nadmission who had scores of 141 and six, including Hunter, who had\n\nscores of 140.      Sixty-seven black students who scored less than\n\nHunter (140) on their CAT test were admitted to the sixth grade.\n\n      The   2002–2003    sixth   grade    CMMS   class    consisted    of   449\n\nstudents.    Fifty-one siblings were admitted, of whom 42 were white\n\nand 9 were black. Another 398 nonsibling students were admitted on\n\nthe basis of their CAT test score ranking, of whom 259 were white\n\nand 139 were black.      While the incoming sixth grade class was 67%\n\nwhite and 33% black, the total student composition of CMMS for the\n\n2002–2003 school year was 65% white and 35% black, a result barely\n\nwithin the    School    Board–required     racial   mix   for   CMMS   of   50%\n\nblack/white, plus or minus 15 percentage points.4\n\n      4\n        Based on our review of data obtained by the Cavaliers from the School\nBoard and submitted in conjunction with a motion for preliminary injunction, it\nappears that if the School Board did not use separate test-ranking lists for\nwhite and black applicants, the score that would have resulted in a sixth grade\nclass at CMMS for the 2002–2003 school year of roughly the same size as the\nactual class would have been 130. Using a score of 130, the sixth grade class\napparently would have been approximately 25% black and 75% white.\n\n                                      4\n\f      The Cavaliers, on behalf of Hunter, filed suit against the\n\nSchool Board, and twelve of its members, alleging that Hunter was\n\ndiscriminated against on the basis of his race when he was denied\n\nadmission    to   CMMS.       The     Cavaliers   sought    declaratory     and\n\ninjunctive, compensatory damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs,\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, and\n\n2000d.    The parties consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by a\n\nmagistrate judge, and the district court referred the case to a\n\nmagistrate judge.      The School Board filed a motion to dismiss or\n\nfor summary judgment on the ground that the admission procedure for\n\nCMMS is pursuant to a court-ordered consent decree and, therefore,\n\nis constitutional.        The magistrate judge granted the defendants’\n\nmotion, dismissing all claims against all parties.5             The Cavaliers\n\nsubsequently filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which the\n\nmagistrate judge denied.       The Cavaliers then timely appealed.\n\n\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n      The Board attempts to justify its admission policy based on a\n\nconsent decree entered in 1981 involving the Board.              Because this\n\nconsent decree no longer applies to CMMS, it cannot justify the\n\nBoard’s policy, and because the Board shows no other compelling\n\ngovernmental interest for its racial classification, we hold that\n\n\n\n      5\n        The magistrate judge previously had dismissed the Cavaliers’ claim for\ncompensatory damages against the individual members of the School Board based on\nqualified immunity. The Cavaliers have not appealed that ruling.\n\n                                        5\n\fthe policy is unconstitutional.            Furthermore, even if CMMS were\n\nstill subject to the decree, because the Board has not shown that\n\nit has considered any race-neutral means to achieve its desired\n\nracial mix and relies exclusively on a racial quota, the policy is\n\nnot narrowly tailored.       Therefore, we reverse and remand.6\n\n\n\n\nI.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review de novo the magistrate judge’s grant of summary\n\njudgment.7    Austin v. Will-Burt Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785484\"><a href=\"/opinion/785484/elizabeth-crowder-austin-individually-and-as-administratrix-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 866 (5th Cir.\n\n2004). Summary judgment is proper only if, viewing the evidence in\n\n      6\n        On July 29, 2004, some two months subsequent to oral argument herein, the\nSchool Board filed with this court a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot. The\nSchool Board attached to its motion an affidavit from its counsel in which she\nstated that: on May 19, 2004, she mailed a letter to the Cavaliers advising them\nthat there were openings for the eighth grade at CMMS for the 2004–2005 school\nyear; if Hunter met the general requirements for admission, he would be admitted\nto the eighth grade at CMMS upon the submission of an application, included with\nthe letter to the Cavaliers; and no further testing would be needed for\nadmission.    The School Board claims that this offer of admission to Hunter\nrenders the appeal moot.\n      We disagree. In their complaint, the Cavaliers sought, among other things,\ncompensatory damages.    In their opposition to the School Board’s motion to\ndismiss the appeal, the Cavaliers have alleged damages due to the School Board’s\npolicy.    The Cavaliers brought their suit in 2002 after Hunter was denied\nadmission to CMMS for the 2002–2003 school year, his sixth grade year. The\nCavaliers allege that because of the denial of Hunter’s admission to CMMS, in\norder to provide the best alternative to CMMS, they enrolled him in a private\nschool for two years, his sixth and seventh grade years, at a cost that was\npresumably higher than what they would have had to pay if Hunter had attended\nCMMS. The private school was also allegedly further from their residence than\nCMMS, resulting in additional transportation costs.

The School\n\nBoard has not identified any current effect or condition at CMMS\n\nthat is    traceable    to   the   past    segregation    within    the   school\n\nsystem.8     Therefore, whether the School Board’s use of racial\n\nclassifications     serves    a    compelling    governmental      interest   by\n\nseeking to remedy the current effects of past segregation depends\n\nentirely on whether the 1981 Consent Decree obligates the School\n\nBoard to use racial classifications in its current admission\n\npolicy.    As we conclude that the 1981 Consent Decree is no longer\n\napplicable to CMMS, it cannot justify the School Board’s race-\n\nconscious admission policy.\n\n                  a.    Background of the 1981 Consent Decree\n\n\n\n      8\n        In their interrogatories, the Cavaliers asked that the School Board\ndescribe all evidence of present effects of past racial discrimination that could\njustify the use of racial classifications in its admission process. The School\nBoard responded that the reason for the use of the racial classifications was “to\ncomply with the [1981] Consent Decree.”      The School Board then stated that\n“[t]here has not been any attempt to determine if other reasons exist which could\njustify the use of racial classifications.”\n\n                                       8\n\f      The 1981 Consent Decree has it roots in litigation that began\n\nin 1965 and that has been the subject of multiple cases within this\n\ncircuit.    The following historical background comes from two\n\nearlier cases involving the 1981 Consent Decree: Jones v. Caddo\n\nParish School Board, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 924–26, (5th Cir. 1981) (Jones\n\nI), and Jones v.

La. 2001) (Jones II):\n\n      In 1965, the parents of seven black children commenced a suit\n\nagainst the School Board seeking desegregation of the Caddo Parish\n\npublic schools. The United States later intervened as a plaintiff.\n\nIn 1973, the district court ordered the School Board to implement\n\na desegregation plan; a plan was developed and took effect.                 In\n\n1976, the School Board filed a motion to have the school system\n\ndeclared unitary, which would have warranted the dismissal of the\n\noriginal suit; however, the United States opposed the motion.                In\n\n1977, the district court: (1) ruled that the School Board had fully\n\ncomplied   with   the     1973    court-ordered    desegregation    plan;   (2)\n\ndeclared the school system to be unitary; and (3) dismissed the\n\nsuit against the School Board. Thereafter, the United States filed\n\na motion to amend the judgment, the filing of which suspended the\n\nfinality of the judgment pending decision on the motion.              In 1980,\n\nthe   district    court    gave    notice   that   unless   the    plaintiffs’\n\nattorneys objected, the United States, as plaintiff-intervenor,\n\nwould represent the interests of the private plaintiffs; the\n\n\n                                        9\n\fdistrict court did not receive any objections.        The United States\n\nand the School Board then entered into negotiations, which resulted\n\nin the district court-ordered 1981 Consent Decree.\n\n                b.    1981 Consent Decree\n\n     In the 1981 Consent Decree, the district court determined that\n\n“the plan for the System embodied in this Decree is reasonable and\n\nappropriate for the additional desegregation of the System, and\n\nupon its successful implementation will in fact and in law create\n\na unitary school system for Caddo Parish.”\n\n     The decree, among other things, called for the establishment\n\nof magnet schools:\n\n     “The Board will establish new magnet schools at three\n     elementary schools . . . and at one middle school (Eden\n     Gardens Junior High School) in order to enhance the\n     quality of education and bring about a greater degree of\n     desegregation at those schools. . . . The Board will\n     establish an aggressive magnet recruitment program and\n     will permit and encourage students to attend magnet\n     schools using every reasonable effort to achieve the\n     projected racial enrollment for each school within the\n     time period permitted under this Decree.”\n\nThe decree also detailed the projected racial enrollment for each\n\nmagnet school and how the projection was to be achieved: “It is\n\nunderstood by the parties that magnet programs at particular\n\nschools may be revised in order to effectively provide for the\n\nrecruitment and retention of students in the magnet schools and to\n\nachieve and maintain a desegregated enrollment.”             The projected\n\nracial   enrollment   for   CMMS—formerly   Eden   Gardens    Junior   High\n\nSchool, located in a predominantly black neighborhood with a\n\n                                   10\n\fpredominantly black student body—was 50% white and 50% black.\n\n“[E]nrollment at each magnet school” was to “be on a parish wide\n\nbasis” and students were to be assigned to the magnet schools based\n\non the following priorities, which were the only priorities stated\n\nin the decree: 1) qualified siblings of students who attend the\n\nmagnet school; 2) qualified black students who would otherwise\n\nattend a school with over 90% black student enrollment; and 3)\n\nqualified white students who would otherwise attend a school with\n\nover 65% white student enrollment. These priorities were to apply,\n\nhowever, only to the extent that they did not impede the School\n\nBoard’s achievement of the projected racial enrollments at the\n\nmagnet schools.\n\n     The School Board was to implement the magnet school program at\n\nEden Gardens Junior High, which would become CMMS, before or\n\nbeginning with the 1982–83 school year.   The School Board was to\n\n“use its best efforts to attain the projected racial enrollments .\n\n. . by the end of the 1984–85 school year by developing attractive\n\nprograms at [CMMS] and by encouraging students of both races to\n\nattend [CMMS] and benefit from [its] programs.”\n\n     The school system was to remain under the jurisdiction of the\n\ndistrict court during the period in which the decree was in effect,\n\nsubject to certain provisions that provided for the termination of\n\nthe court’s jurisdiction. The decree specifically provided for the\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\ftermination of the district court’s jurisdiction over the magnet\n\nand laboratory9 schools:\n\n     “With respect to the magnet school and laboratory school\n     proposals contained in . . . this Decree, the Board shall\n     have three years from the respective implementation dates\n     for each such school within which to meet the projected\n     enrollments at the magnet and laboratory schools. Such\n     projected enrollments for a particular school shall be\n     deemed to have been met if the actual enrollment in the\n     school is within ± 15 percentage points of the projection\n     for such school . . . .      Upon meeting the projected\n     enrollments for all magnet and laboratory schools covered\n     by this Section D of Part V, this Decree shall terminate\n     as to such schools, the Board shall be entitled to an\n     order of the Court so stating, and the United States\n     shall not be entitled to seek any further or additional\n     remedy with respect to such schools.”\n\n     Finally, the decree outlined the procedure by which the School\n\nBoard could seek an order declaring the school system to be unitary\n\nand dismissing the case:\n\n     “At any time after the 1983–84 school year, the Board may\n     file a Notice of Compliance with the terms and conditions\n     of this Decree. If the United States agrees that the\n     Board is in full compliance with the terms and conditions\n     of this Decree, the United States shall join in the\n     Notice and shall state that it supports an order\n     declaring the System to be unitary and dismissing the\n     case. If no objection to the Notice is made within 30\n     days of its filing, the Court shall enter an order\n     declaring the entire system unitary, to the extent it has\n     not already been so declared, and terminating this case.\n     Any objections must be specific as to alleged terms of\n     noncompliance with the provisions of this Decree. The\n     objections shall be heard by the Court under reasonable\n     procedures set forth by the Court and in the event any\n     further remedy is ordered, it shall be limited to\n     resolving the objection so filed.”\n\n\n\n     9\n        The decree directed the School Board to establish a laboratory school\nprogram that would be operated in conjunction with area universities and\ncolleges.\n\n                                     12\n\f                 c.   1990 Order\n\n     In 1987, the School Board filed a Notice of Compliance with\n\nthe 1981 Consent Decree and requested the district court to rule\n\nthat the school system had achieved unitary status. On April 4,\n\n1990, based on a joint motion filed by United States and the School\n\nBoard, the district court entered an order affirming the parties’\n\nagreement (the 1990 Order).      Jones II, 204 F.R.D. at 98–99.         The\n\n1990 Order provided in pertinent part:\n\n     “(1) Except as specifically set forth in § 7 of the\n          Joint Motion, there are no issues or disputes\n          regarding    successful    compliance   and    full\n          implementation of the 1981 Consent Decree;\n                               * * *\n     (3) The [] Board has within the appropriate parameters\n          met the projected enrollments for all magnet and\n          laboratory schools covered by Part V, Sections D[,\n          termination of jurisdiction over magnet and\n          laboratory schools,] . . .;\n     (4) In accordance with Part V, Sections A-E of the\n          Consent Decree:\n          (i) The Consent Decree is terminated . . . as to\n               magnet schools and laboratory schools covered\n               by Sections D and E, Part V of the Decree, and\n               the United States shall not be entitled to\n               seek any further or additional remedy with\n               respect to any of said magnet schools,\n               laboratory schools, schools north of Caddo\n               Lake, nor with respect to any Mandatory\n               Assignment District [in the decree] . . . .”\n\n     With the entry of the 1990 Order, none of the remaining\n\n“issues   or   disputes   regarding    successful   compliance   and   full\n\nimplementation of the 1981 Consent Decree” involved CMMS, mandatory\n\nstudent assignments, or projected racial enrollments. The portions\n\nof the 1981 decree that the United States insisted, in section 7 of\n\n\n                                      13\n\fthe 1990 Joint Motion, had not been fully implemented as required\n\nwere the following: assignment of principals to schools (under Part\n\nI, Section F, entitled “Faculty and Staff”); establishment of\n\nenhancement programs at remaining one-race schools (under Part II,\n\nSection E, entitled “Remaining One-Race Schools,” relating to\n\nprograms at such schools); and Majority to Minority Transfers\n\n(under Part II, Section F, relating to allowing and encouraging, in\n\nreference to one-race schools, transfers of students from a school\n\nin which the student is in the racial majority to a school in which\n\nthe student would be in the minority).    See Jones II, 204 F.R.D. at\n\n99 n.1.\n\n                d.   Status of the 1981 Consent Decree\n\n      Based on the 1990 Order, the 1981 Consent Decree is no longer\n\napplicable to CMMS and cannot form the justification for the use of\n\nracial classifications in CMMS’s admission policy.        The Consent\n\nDecree clearly contemplated that it could be terminated with\n\nrespect to the magnet schools:\n\n      “Upon meeting the projected enrollments for all magnet\n      and laboratory schools . . ., this Decree shall terminate\n      as to such schools, the Board shall be entitled to an\n      order of the Court so stating, and the United States\n      shall not be entitled to seek any further or additional\n      remedy with respect to such schools.” (emphasis added).\n\nUnder the Consent Decree, the School Board had the obligation to\n\nuse “every reasonable effort” and “its best efforts” to “achieve”\n\nor “attain” the projected racial enrollments for CMMS by the end of\n\nthe   1984–85   school   year,   and   upon   meeting   the   projected\n\n                                  14\n\fenrollments, the Consent Decree was to terminate as to CMMS.                         The\n\nConsent    Decree,    however,       did    not   give    the    School      Board    an\n\nindefinite obligation to maintain the projected racial enrollment\n\nfor CMMS once the decree was terminated as to CMMS.\n\n      Consistent with the provisions of the 1981 Consent Decree, the\n\n1990 Order unambiguously released the magnet schools, including\n\nCMMS, from any further obligations of or under the Consent Decree:\n\n“The []    Board     has    within   the    appropriate        parameters     met    the\n\nprojected enrollments for all magnet and laboratory schools”;10 “The\n\nConsent Decree is terminated . . . as to the magnet schools. . .,\n\nand the United States shall not be entitled to seek any further or\n\nadditional remedy with respect to any of said magnet schools . . .\n\n.”   Therefore, with respect to the 1981 Consent Decree, upon which\n\nthe School Board justifies its racial classification, there is\n\nnothing left regarding CMMS.\n\n      Moreover, the law is clear that the School Board’s obligation\n\nunder the Consent Decree may be reduced or eliminated in some\n\nrespects even if the entire school system is not totally in\n\ncompliance    with    the    Consent   Decree     or     has    not   been   declared\n\nunitary.

In Freeman, the Supreme Court held that\n\na “district court need not retain active control over every aspect\n\nof school administration until a school district has demonstrated\n\nunitary status in all facets of its system.”   Freeman, 112 S.Ct. at\n\n1436.\n\n          “We hold that, in the course of supervising\n     desegregation plans, federal courts have the authority to\n     relinquish supervision and control of school districts in\n     incremental stages, before full compliance has been\n     achieved in every area of school operations.        While\n     retaining jurisdiction over the case, the court may\n     determine that it will not order further remedies in\n     areas where the school district is in compliance with the\n     decree. That is to say, upon a finding that a school\n     system subject to a court-supervised desegregation plan\n     is in compliance in some but not all areas, the court in\n     appropriate cases may return control to the school system\n     in those areas where compliance has been achieved,\n     limiting further judicial supervision to operations that\n     are not yet in full compliance with the court decree. In\n     particular, the district court may determine that it will\n     not order further remedies in the area of student\n     assignments where racial imbalance is not traceable, in\n     a proximate way, to constitutional violations.” Id. at\n     1445–46.\n\n     The Supreme Court did recognize that “[t]wo or more Green\n\nfactors may be intertwined . . . in their relation, so that a\n\nconstitutional violation in one area cannot be eliminated unless\n\nthe judicial remedy addresses other matters as well” and that,\n\n                                 16\n\f“[a]s a consequence, a continuing violation in one area may need to\n\nbe addressed by remedies in another.”            Id. at 1449.      Nevertheless,\n\nthe record must demonstrate why a continuing remedy in one area in\n\nwhich the school system was compliant was needed to remedy the\n\nremaining defects:\n\n     “There was no showing that racial balancing was an\n     appropriate mechanism to cure other deficiencies . . . .\n     It is true that the school district was not in compliance\n     with respect to faculty assignments, but the record does\n     not show that student reassignments would be a feasible\n     or practicable way to remedy this defect.” Id.\n\n     A case from the First Circuit, Wessmann v. Gittens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198211\"><a href=\"/opinion/198211/wessmann-v-gittens/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1998), illustrates the application of Freeman in a\n\nsituation very similar to the present case.              In a background case\n\nto Wessmann, a district court in 1974 found “the school system as\n\na whole guilty of de jure segregation” and concluded that three\n\nschools operated by the City of Boston, including Boston Latin\n\nSchool (BLS), “were complicit in promoting and maintaining a dual\n\nschool system.”     Id. at 791–92.           The district court, among other\n\nthings, required BLS to ensure that at least 35% of each entering\n\nclass would be made up of black and Hispanic students.                  By 1987,\n\nthe three schools had, “for all practical purposes,” achieved\n\nunitary   status    in   the   area    of    student    assignments;    however,\n\n“comparable improvement had not been accomplished in other areas,\n\nsuch as   faculty    and   staff      integration      and   the   renovation   of\n\nfacilities.”   Id. at 792.

The district court then relinquished control over\n\nstudent assignments, freeing the schools from the requirement to\n\nmaintain the 35% set-aside, but retained active supervision over\n\nother aspects of the school system.          Id.\n\n     Similar to the background situation described in Wessmann, in\n\n1990 the district court relinquished judicial supervision over\n\nprojected racial enrollments at all magnet schools within the Caddo\n\nParish school system by terminating the decree with respect to the\n\nmagnet schools, as allowed by Freeman and by the terms of the 1981\n\nConsent Decree.    While the 1990 Order did not wholly terminate the\n\nentire Consent Decree, none of the remaining issues regarding its\n\nsuccessful compliance and full implementation involved CMMS.                  In\n\nfact, none of the remaining issues—faculty and staff assignments,\n\nenhancing of remaining one-race schools, and majority to minority\n\ntransfers—related      to   meeting    projected     racial   enrollments     or\n\nmandatory    student   assignments      at   any    school    in    the   system.\n\nAccording to the 1990 Order, the School Board had complied with all\n\nstudent assignment and projected enrollment provisions of the\n\nConsent Decree.    Furthermore, we see nothing in the School Board’s\n\nsummary judgment evidence to suggest that continued student racial\n\nbalancing at CMMS is a “feasible or practicable way” to remedy the\n\nremaining deficiencies identified in the 1990 Order. In any event,\n\n\n                                       18\n\fthe Consent Decree stated that the magnet schools were to be\n\nestablished at particular schools “in order to enhance the quality\n\nof education and bring about a greater degree of desegregation at\n\nthose schools,” (emphasis added), not at all schools within the\n\ndistrict.11\n\n      Therefore, based on the 1990 Order, the 1981 Consent Decree is\n\nno longer applicable to CMMS and cannot be used in any sense to\n\njustify the racial quotas and balancing contained in the CMMS\n\nadmission     policy.     As   the   1981   Consent   Decree    has   not   been\n\napplicable to CMMS since 1990, the School Board cannot rely on the\n\nConsent Decree to establish a finding of current effects of past\n\ndiscrimination.     In order to support its actions, the School Board\n\n“must make specific findings, independent of the Decree,” and as\n\nthere are no such findings before us in the record, “we cannot hold\n\n      11\n         The School Board argues that until the school system is declared unitary\nin whole or in part, the School Board is obligated by law to comply with the\nprovisions of the Consent Decree. This is, in essence, a collateral attack on\nthe 1990 Order. Morever, the Board’s argument fails to recognize the holding in\nFreeman:\n      “To say . . . that a school district must meet all six Green factors\n      before the trial court can declare the system unitary and relinquish\n      its control over school attendance zones, and to hold further that\n      racial balancing by all necessary means is required in the interim,\n      is simply to vindicate a legal phrase.          The law is not so\n      formalistic.” Freeman, 112 S.Ct. at 1448–49.\n      Similarly, in finding that the admission policy was justified because of\nthe 1981 Consent Decree, the magistrate judge stated that the 1990 Order “did not\ndeclare expressly that the district was unitary in student attendance patterns.”\nNevertheless, even though the 1990 Order did not use the magic word “unitary”\nwith respect to the magnet schools, that was its effect.          The 1990 Order\nexpressly “terminated” the 1981 consent decree “as to” the “magnet schools” and\ndeclared that all provisions concerning the magnet schools, and concerning all\nstudent assignments and projected racial enrollments, had been fulfilled and that\nthe United States was not entitled to seek further remedies with respect to the\nmagnet schools or any mandatory student assignment provision in the decree. The\n1990 Order did not need to specifically say “unitary” to effectively declare that\nthe magnet schools were outside of the 1981 Consent Decree.\n\n                                       19\n\fthat   [the   School     Board’s   actions]    were    in   furtherance        of   a\n\ncompelling state purpose.”         Police Ass’n of New Orleans Through\n\nCannatella v.

In    Wessman,      after   the   schools\n\ndiscontinued the use of the 35% racial set-aside, they subsequently\n\nadopted a policy that allocated half of the seats of each new class\n\nusing “flexible racial/ethnic guidelines.”             Wessmann, 160 F.3d at\n\n793.    Thereafter, a white student who would have been admitted to\n\nBLS but for the policy that accounted for race, brought suit\n\nagainst the school committee. The district court upheld the policy\n\nin part because it supposedly was aimed at remedying the vestiges\n\nof past discrimination.         Id. at 793–94.        However, on appeal the\n\nFirst Circuit reversed and struck down the policy, rejecting the\n\nexplanation     that    the   policy   redressed      the   vestiges      of   past\n\ndiscrimination.        The school committee was not able to satisfy its\n\nburden of showing a “strong basis in evidence” that the policy\n\nremedied past segregation, id. at 800, in spite of the fact that\n\nthe schools had previously been found guilty of maintaining a dual\n\nschool system and had been required to specifically reserve at\n\nleast 35% of BLS seats to certain minorities.\n\n\n\n\n                                       20\n\f      The School Board relies on the unpublished opinion Bryant v.\n\nCaddo Parish School Board, CV No. 95-0441 (W.D. La. Jan. 3, 1997).\n\nIn Bryant, which likewise involved a white student’s challenge to\n\nthe CMMS admissions criteria, the plaintiffs argued that the 1981\n\nConsent Decree was no longer applicable because of the 1990 Order.12\n\nThe district court rejected the argument, relying on the fact that\n\nthe plaintiff had not established that the entire Consent Decree\n\nhad been complied with and on the fact that the entire school\n\nsystem had not been declared unitary:\n\n      “Bryant fails to mention, however, that this Court did\n      not hold that Part I, Section F-Faculty and Staff; Part\n      II, Section E-Remaining One-Race Schools; and Part II,\n      Section F-Majority to Minority Transfers- of the Consent\n      Order had been fully implemented and complied with.\n      Furthermore, Bryant has failed to produce any evidence\n      demonstrating that the Caddo Parish School system has\n\n\n      12\n         Both the policy in Bryant and in the present case have the same criteria\nto determine qualified applicants and to rank those qualified applicants. The\npolicy in the present case mandates the use of two ranking lists–one for white\nstudents and one for black students, and while there is no indication in Bryant\nthat the policy involved there mandated two separate ranking lists, we\nnevertheless assume that it most likely did: Policy JECC indicates that it was\nadopted February 2, 1983, and amended January 16, 1985, without any indication\nthat its content was any different when Bryant applied to CMMS in 1994 than it\nwas when Hunter applied in 2002.      Also, at oral argument, the School Board\nclaimed that policy in Bryant is the same policy before us now.      If there is any\ndifference between the two cases, it may be with respect to the projected racial\nenrollment requirement—here the racial mix is a requirement, whereas in Bryant\nit was merely a goal. In the present case, the Board is governed by Item No.\n37—adopted after Bryant—requiring CMMS to be within the racial parameters of the\n1981 Consent Decree (50/50, ±15 percentage points). In Bryant, however, the\nracial enrollment goal of 50/50, ±15 percentage points appears to be only a goal.\nNevertheless, regardless of Item No. 37, Policy JECC, the policy presumably in\neffect at the time of Bryant, provides that “vacancies will be filled from the\nrankings in accord with the projected racial enrollments called for in the\nConsent Decree.” While Item No. 37 appears to make the 1981 Consent Decree\nracial enrollment projections a firm requirement for the School Board, it appears\nthat even at the time of Bryant, the admission policy sought to fill vacancies\naccording to the same projections. Therefore, the policy in Bryant appears to\nbe substantially the same as the policy in the present case.\n\n                                        21\n\f     fully implemented and complied with the remaining\n     sections of the Consent Decree. Thus, the Caddo Parish\n     public school system has not been declared unitary and\n     the Consent Decree still applies to the Caddo Parish\n     Schools which, of course, includes [CMMS].” Id.\n\nOn appeal, this court summarily affirmed the district court,\n\nstating only:\n\n     “We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the records\n     excerpts and relevant portions of the record itself. For\n     the reasons stated by the district court in its\n     memorandum ruling and Order filed under date of January\n     3, 1997, we are satisfied that the Summary Judgment\n     granted by the district court in favor of Caddo Parish\n     School Board should be and is now AFFIRMED.” Bryant v.\n     Caddo Parish School Board, No. 97-30135 (5th Cir.\n     September 26, 1997) (per curiam; unpublished).\n\n     We are not bound by our affirmance of the district court in\n\nBryant.    The opinion is not precedential, as it is an unpublished\n\nopinion issued pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5 after January 1,\n\n1996.     Under Rule 47.5.4, the opinion is binding only under the\n\ndoctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, or law of the case,\n\nnone of which apply here.\n\n     While an unpublished opinion may be persuasive under Rule\n\n47.5.4, we are not persuaded by the Bryant affirmance or by the\n\nunderlying district court opinion.    We based our affirmance on the\n\n“reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum ruling,”\n\nwithout providing any independent analysis.    The district court’s\n\none-paragraph discussion of the 1981 Consent Decree in light of the\n\n1990 Order did not address several key points of the analysis: 1)\n\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Freeman that allows a school\n\n\n                                 22\n\fdistrict to be declared unitary in an incremental fashion; 2) the\n\nConsent Decree itself contemplated that the magnet schools would be\n\nreleased from the decree when their related obligations were\n\nimplemented; 3) the purpose of the magnet schools was to “enhance\n\nthe quality of education and bring about a greater degree of\n\ndesegregation at [the schools that were to become the magnet]\n\nschools,” (emphasis added); and 4) there is no clear relationship\n\nbetween the remaining deficiencies outlined in the 1990 Order, none\n\nof which dealt with racial enrollment projections, and racial\n\nbalancing at CMMS.      Therefore, the Bryant case does not influence\n\nour reasoning with respect to the 1990 Order and its effect on the\n\n1981 Consent Decree.13\n\n      The School Board also points to, and the magistrate judge\n\nrelied on, Davis v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427620\"><a href=\"/opinion/427620/clifford-eugene-davis-jr-v-east-baton-rouge-parish-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1983), in which this court upheld an admission\n\npolicy similar to that used by the School Board here.              In Davis,\n\nthe school board operated under a court-approved admission policy\n\naccording to which the board selected applicants to its magnet\n\nschools using two lists, one for white students and one for black\n\n      13\n        Concerning the 1990 Order and its effect on the 1981 Consent Decree, in\n2001 the district court in Jones II commented that the parties seeking to\nintervene at that time were seeking to do so “twenty years after the district\ncourt entered the 1981 Consent Decree, and 11 years after the court granted\nunitary status to the school district.” Jones II, 204 F.R.D. at 100 (emphasis\nadded). The district court then stated that the “only issue remaining before\nthis court is continued compliance with the parameters of the 1990 order.” Id.\nWhile this is not determinative, it does indicate that one previous district\njudge thought, as we hold now, that the 1990 Order did reduce the scope of the\n1981 Consent Decree.\n\n\n                                      23\n\fstudents.   The board was to fill seats from the separate lists to\n\nachieve a racial balance at each magnet school of 60% white\n\nstudents and 40% black students.         If by April 1 of each year the\n\nseats at a magnet school reserved for a particular race had not\n\nbeen filled, those seats could be opened to students of any other\n\nrace.   The district court, however, later modified the admission\n\npolicy directing that white students could not be admitted in any\n\nproportion greater than 60% of the total enrollment.             The school\n\nboard appealed the modification and we affirmed.               Id. at 1440.\n\nDavis is wholly distinguishable from the present case.             In Davis,\n\nthe school board was still under the court’s supervision with\n\nrespect to the admission policy.              Further, almost no time had\n\npassed since the creation of the court’s plan—the plan was designed\n\nto begin in the 1981–1982 school year and was modified in 1982, and\n\nour ruling was issued in 1983.                Id. at 1433–34, 1440.     The\n\nsituation   in   the   present   case    is    significantly   different—the\n\nConsent Decree was issued in 1981, judicial supervision over CMMS\n\nwas withdrawn in 1990, and there have been no subsequent findings\n\nof segregation or vestiges of past segregation or orders requiring\n\nthe continued use of remedial racial classifications. In addition,\n\nin Davis the use of separate lists was explicitly part of the\n\ncourt-approved plan.     In contrast, here the Consent Decree did not\n\nmandate, or even suggest, that the School Board use separate test-\n\nscore ranking lists for blacks and whites; the use of separate\n\n\n                                    24\n\flists is directed by the School Board’s own admission policy.\n\nDavis, therefore, is simply not applicable here.\n\n                  e.     No Other Vestiges of Past Segregation\n\n      There is no evidence in the record of current segregation\n\nwithin   the    school    system    or    at   CMMS   or   vestiges    of   past\n\ndiscrimination.14      The School Board thus fails to show that it has\n\na “‘strong basis in evidence’ showing that a current social ill in\n\n\n\n      14\n         At oral argument, counsel for the School Board suggested two vestiges\nof past segregation: the fact that the school system still has several one-race\nschools and the test-score disparity between white and black students. As this\n“evidence” is not in the record and was suggested for the first time at oral\nargument, it is not properly before us. United States v. Simpson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"31518\"><a href=\"/opinion/31518/united-states-v-simpson/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n454 n.1 (5th Cir. 2003).\n      Nevertheless, even if we were to consider the School Board’s suggested\nvestiges, the School Board has not shown that the existence of the one-race\nschools and the test-score gap is traceable to past segregation. Regarding one-\nrace schools, the Supreme Court has declared that “the existence of some small\nnumber of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools within a district is not in\nand of itself the mark of a system that still practices segregation by law.”\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Davis, 721 F.2d at 1433. Furthermore, the 1981 Consent\nDecree itself explicitly recognized that the elimination of all one-race schools\nwithin the school system was not practicable: “The parties and the Court\nrecognize that the elimination of all racially identifiable schools in the System\nis impracticable.” “[T]he parties, after exploring all avenues to attempt to\nachieve desegregation in [certain] schools, have determined . . . that there is\nno feasible and practical means of accomplishing desegregation at those schools\nother than the actions [described concerning one-race schools].” “[T]here will\nremain under the provisions of this Decree a number of one-race or predominantly\none-race schools which, for various reasons . . ., it is not practically possible\nto effectively desegregate given the current circumstances existing in Caddo\nParish.” The School Board has not shown in any way, particularly in light of the\nConsent Decree’s language, how the continued existence of one-race schools is\ntraceable to past segregation within the school system.\n      Concerning the test-score gap, the Board has produced no evidence and\nprovided no analysis whatsoever regarding a causal connection between the gap and\npast de jure segregation. As “achievement gap statistics, by themselves, do not\neven eliminate the possibility that they are caused by what the Court terms\n‘societal discrimination,’” Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 803, the mere suggestion that\nthe gap is a vestige of past discrimination is not sufficient. Moreover, it is\nobvious that virtually none of the students entering the eighth (or lower) grade\nfor the 2002-03 school year was or had ever been a student at any school governed\nby the School Board when the 1990 Order was entered.\n\n                                         25\n\ffact has been caused by such conduct.”           Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 800\n\n(quoting City of Richmond v.

No Other Compelling Interests\n\n      Besides relying on the 1981 Consent Decree, the School Board\n\nhas not attempted to argue, or make any showing, that the racial\n\nclassifications in its admission policy can be justified by some\n\nother compelling governmental interest.           The magistrate judge also\n\nrelied exclusively on the decree to uphold CMMS’s admission policy,\n\nexplicitly stating that it was not deciding, or being asked to\n\ndecide, whether it could constitutionally order the implementation\n\nof the admission policy or whether the policy could withstand a\n\nconstitutional challenge if the purpose was to achieve diversity15\n\nor some similar social goal.\n\n      The School Board’s current policy is essentially a racial\n\nbalancing quota.       The 1981 Consent Decree no longer applies to\n\nCMMS, and racial balancing by itself is not a constitutionally\n\n\n      15\n         The School Board has not claimed that its policy seeks to achieve\ndiversity among the students at CMMS. The School Board has specifically limited\nits justification for the policy to the 1981 Consent Decree and expressly argued,\nin its briefs and at oral argument, that Grutter and Gratz are distinguishable\nand “very different” cases because they dealt with efforts to achieve diversity\nin the student body and not with a desegregation order to remedy past\ndiscrimination.    Moreover, while student body diversity has been held a\ncompelling state interest in the context of a law school, Grutter v.

Further, there is no evidence that the\n\nSchool Board has considered any race-neutral means which might\n\narguably result in an increase in the percentage of black students\n\nat CMMS.16      Moreover, as the School Board cannot justify its\n\noutright racial balancing absent a showing of current effects of\n\nprior segregation, which it has not done, its use of a racial quota\n\nis improper.     While “the use made of mathematical ratios” as “no\n\nmore than a starting point in the process of shaping a remedy,\n\nrather than an inflexible requirement,” might be appropriate in\n\ncertain contexts,       Swann, 91 S.Ct. at 1267 (emphasis added), the\n\nSchool Board’s use of a racial quota supposedly pursuant to the\n\n1981 Consent Decree but more than twenty years after the signing of\n\nthe decree – and more than a decade after the 1990 Order – is\n\n\n\n\n      16\n        Some examples of race-neutral means that the Board might have considered\ninclude: recruiting highly qualified black students who might not otherwise apply\nto CMMS, employing programs in elementary schools to improve standardized test\nscores for potential but underachieving student applicants, or considering\ncertain characteristics of the applicants’ parents (such as socio-economic\nstatus, educational level, or number of parents in a student’s home).\n\n                                       28\n\fhardly a “starting point” and appears rather to be an improper\n\n“inflexible requirement.”17\n\n      With respect to narrow tailoring, we also observe that the\n\npolicy does not even follow the dictates of the 1981 Consent Decree\n\nitself.    The Consent Decree did not expressly mandate the use of a\n\nrace-conscious admission policy.18          Although the Consent Decree did\n\ngive a projected racial enrollment goal, all the measures that it\n\nspecifically mentioned were race-neutral ones.            The Consent Decree\n\nprovided that the School Board would “establish an aggressive\n\nmagnet     recruitment   program    and     [would]   permit   and   encourage\n\nstudents to attend magnet schools using every reasonable effort to\n\nachieve the projected racial enrollment for each school.” (emphasis\n\nadded).     The School Board was to use its “best efforts to attain\n\nthe projected racial enrollments [for the magnet schools] . . . by\n\n\n\n      17\n         The School Board does not see its use of racial quotas as a starting\npoint and does not appear to have an end in mind. In an interrogatory, the\nCavaliers asked the School Board to describe “any time limitation after which all\nconsideration of race in the admissions policy at [CMMS] . . . will be\ndiscontinued, or any objective, which if attained, would cause all consideration\nof race in the admissions policy at [CMMS] to be discontinued.” In response, the\nSchool Board simply stated that the “current policy will be followed as long as\nthe policy is in effect. Whether the Board in the future may revise the policy\ncalls for speculation.” The School Board’s policy clearly is not a starting\npoint, and the consideration of race is not specifically and carefully limited,\nat least in the temporal respect, to some compelling interest.\n      18\n         The School Board has admitted that the Consent Decree only implicitly\nmandates the use of a race-conscious admission policy.      In response to the\nCavaliers’ request for any evidence that the School Board had received approval\nfrom the district court to use racial classifications, the School Board pointed\nto the 1981 Consent Decree and stated that it “consider[ed] it implicit in this\nDecree that magnet schools, because they do not enroll children on the basis of\nattendance zones, must use race conscious admissions policies in order to meet\nthe required projected racial enrollments, and that race conscious admissions\npolicies are permitted.” (emphasis added).\n\n                                       29\n\fdeveloping attractive programs at [the magnet schools] and by\n\nencouraging students of both races to attend such schools and\n\nbenefit from their programs.” (emphasis added). The Consent Decree\n\nfurther explained that “magnet programs at particular schools may\n\nbe revised in order to effectively provide for the recruitment and\n\nretention of students in the magnet schools and to achieve and\n\nmaintain a desegregated enrollment.” (emphasis added).\n\n      The Consent Decree did not mandate that the School Board\n\nemploy a    separate    list/quota     system    or   any   other   such   race-\n\nconscious policy to arrive at the projected racial enrollment goal.\n\nRather, the School Board was to use every reasonable effort and its\n\nbest efforts to recruit and encourage students and to develop\n\nattractive programs and to revise the programs in order to achieve\n\nand maintain the desired level of desegregation.                    The School\n\nBoard’s use of a racial quota does not constitute any one (or a\n\ncombination) of the actions expressly mandated by the Consent\n\nDecree. Moreover, the Consent Decree itself wholly terminated more\n\nthan a decade ago as to the magnet schools.19\n\n\n      19\n         A brief response to the dissent.\n      The dissent relies on the language in Swann v.

Charlotte-\nMecklenberg Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775329\"><a href=\"/opinion/775329/terry-belk-dwayne-collins-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-the-class-they/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2001), exonerating the\nschool board from damages for race-based admissions to a magnet school prior to\nthe district court’s dismissal of the underlying decree on the basis that the\ndistrict was unitary. In Belk, unlike the situation here, there had been no\nprior order specifically removing the magnet schools from the extant\ndesegregation orders. Of the six judges in Belk who voted for this holding (five\njudges would have held the board liable), four were of the view that the prior\norders, extant at the time for which damages were sought, “specifically\nauthorized the use of fixed ratios based on race in assigning students to magnet\nschools.” Id. at 408 (opinion of Judge Motz) (and it is not clear that the other\ntwo judges in the six judge majority were not of the same view; see id. at 353-\n56, opinion of Chief Judge Wilkinson). Belk might be analogous to this case if\nthis case involved a claim for denial of access to CMMS in, say, 1986. Rather,\nthis case involves denial of access to CMMS more than a decade after the 1990\norder entirely removing it from the only extant court order, and is hence\nanalogous to Wessmann v. Gittens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198211\"><a href=\"/opinion/198211/wessmann-v-gittens/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1998), cited with\napparent approval in Judge Motz’s Belk opinion (269 F.3d at 410).\n      Moreover, in view of the wording of the 1990 order – which expressly\n“terminated” the 1981 order (the only extant desegregation related order) “as to\n[the] magnet schools” and provided “the United States shall not be entitled to\nseek any further or additional remedy with respect to any of said magnet\nschools,” it is wholly clear that there was no reasonable possibility whatever\nthat the school board could be exposed to sanctions for post-1990 abandonment of\nits rigid racial quota magnet school admissions policy (which itself was never\nmandated by the 1981 decree). Finally, it is manifestly unfair and illogical to\nplace on the plaintiffs the burden to prove that there was no conceivable\njustification for the board’s use, over a decade after the 1990 order, of a rigid\n\n                                       31\n\f                                 Conclusion\n\n      Based on the foregoing, we REVERSE and REMAND for further\n\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                          REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\nracial quota admissions system at CMMS, when the board had all the relevant data\nand resources but defended its action below only on the manifestly erroneous\nground of compliance with the 1981 decree (see note 8 and accompanying test\nsupra).\n\n\n\n                                      32\n\fWIENER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       The brooding omnipresence that overarches the panel majority’s\n\nreversal of the district court is the unarticulated premise ——\n\nfatally flawed, I submit —— that the trial court’s partial release\n\nof the consent decree vis-à-vis Caddo Magnet School, ipso facto\n\nvoided the very programs and policies long employed by the school\n\ndistrict to achieve that partial release.                As I shall explain more\n\nfully below, I am compelled, with my utmost respect, to dissent.\n\n       If the school board had unilaterally adopted its racial-quota\n\nadmissions policy for magnet schools anew —— after the Caddo Parish\n\nSchool District had been declared unitary (which it has not) or\n\neven after the court had ceased its supervision of the particular\n\nmagnet school’s student admissions policy under the consent decree\n\n(which it has) —— I would likely have no concerns about joining the\n\nmajority’s opinion.             But that is not our case and thus not the\n\nframework within which we must review it. Rather than a brand-new,\n\npost   hoc    admissions        policy,    the   plan   that     we   must    test   for\n\nconstitutionality          is   (1)   a   longstanding    race-based         admissions\n\npolicy,      (2)   which    has    been    “on   the    books”    and   consistently\n\nadministered for many years, (3) pursuant to an existing consent\n\ndecree, (4) as part and parcel of the school board’s comprehensive\n\nand continuing efforts, specifically to comply with the district\n\ncourt’s mandate to achieve a 50/50 ratio in the Magnet Schools and\n\ngenerally to eradicate all vestiges of past segregation.                       When we\n\nreview the case in this framework —— as we must —— the school\n\fboard’s      discretionary      decision        to   retain     its    magnet     school\n\nadmissions policy as an integral tool in the Board’s ongoing\n\nstruggle to achieve its court-ordered, yet-unrealized goal of total\n\ndesegregation easily passes our scrutiny.\n\n      Cessation of court supervision of the magnet school aspect of\n\nthe consent decree is not the equivalent of a court declaration\n\nthat the persistent vestiges of more than a century of school\n\nsegregation have ceased to plague a substantial majority of Caddo’s\n\nminority school students.              Although the Supreme Court allows\n\ndistrict courts to discontinue supervision over some (but less than\n\nall) aspects of plans to achieve unitary status in historically\n\nsegregated school districts, the Court has never ruled that such a\n\npartial release from supervision forecloses a school district’s\n\noption to continue using the ensconced race-conscious policies that\n\nenabled it to achieve and maintain such status.                    To the contrary,\n\nthe Court has consistently emphasized the importance of affording\n\nschool districts maximum discretion and control over local schools,\n\nparticularly       with     respect   to   remedying      the     vestiges       of   past\n\nsegregation.20         In    fact,    it   has       explicitly       endorsed    school\n\ndistricts’ use of race-conscious policies.21\n\n\n      20\n         See, e.g., Freeman v.

Nevertheless, race-based\n\nfeatures of school districts’ desegregation plans enacted pursuant\n\nto court order, such as the one here at issue, are afforded a\n\nspecial presumption that they address a compelling state interest\n\n—— remedying the effects of past segregation —— over and above the\n\ngeneral deference that we accord local school districts’ efforts to\n\ncomply with each aspect of court-ordered desegregation plans.\n\nHere, the 1990 consent decree expressly released Caddo Middle\n\nMagnet School (“Caddo Magnet”) from further court supervision.   To\n\nthis day, however, the school district as a whole remains bound\n\nunder the consent decree, and the Board risks court sanctions if it\n\ndoes not make bona fide efforts to fulfill all its obligations\n\nunder the order.   If, therefore, we were to prohibit the Board’s\n\ncontinued use of those race-conscious policies that have long been\n\nin place, and at the same time were to threaten sanctions if the\n\nboard does not continue its efforts to remedy the effects of past\n\nracial discrimination, we would be putting the Board in a classic\n\n“Catch-22” situation.      In consequence, our review of the Caddo\n\nMagnet admissions policy must take into account the timing and\n\nhistory of that policy and the circumstances under which the school\n\ndistrict operates —— and defer to local authority to the maximum\n\nextent of our authority.\n\nPartial Unitary Status\n\n                                  35\n\f       The panel majority cites no Supreme Court pronouncements, (and\n\nI have found none) on the effect that a district court’s declaring\n\na school district “partially unitary” has on a school board’s\n\ncontinued use of policies validly enacted and continually applied\n\nin compliance with a consent decree.                      Despite the majority’s\n\nreliance on Freeman v. Pitts, that case addresses the equitable\n\npower of district courts to supervise continuing desegregation\n\nefforts, not the discretion of school boards to decide how to\n\nimplement these efforts.             The Freeman Court permitted district\n\ncourts to relinquish control over local school districts gradually\n\nby declaring them unitary in increments, i.e., to release districts\n\nfrom    the     obligation    to   continue       some    discrete    desegregation\n\npolicies       while    continuing      to    address     remaining    vestiges     of\n\ndiscrimination in other areas.22              Significantly, this decision did\n\nnothing to diminish either the discretion of school districts to\n\ncontinue programs previously enacted pursuant to a consent decree\n\nor the deference we must afford to the districts’ exercise of that\n\ndiscretion.23         In fact, when the Court has taken up the issue of\n\nschool       board    discretion   to    consider        race   in   implementing   a\n\ndesegregation policy, it has acknowledged that board discretion to\n\nimplement such policies exceeds the equitable power of the courts\n\nto order them to do so.\n\n\n\n       22\n            Freeman v.

This opinion\naddressed the equitable power of district courts to order school districts to\ninstitute a variety of programs to address past segregation, and made clear that\nthis equitable power does not reach as far as the inherent power of school\nauthorities.   Certainly, language comparing courts' power to that of school\nauthorities plays a role in the Court's effort to define the reach of district\ncourt's authority.

Inasmuch as the Supreme Court\nhas never stated, even in dicta, what the majority holds, I do not think that\nthis point undermines my analysis of the case.\n\n                                        37\n\fIn this decision and others, the Court endorsed local discretion to\n\nuse racial balancing as a means of correcting inequities caused by\n\nde jure segregation, and it has never reversed itself on this\n\nissue.25     In Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, the Court\n\nstruck down a citizen initiative enacted to prevent local school\n\ndistricts      from   implementing      race-based     student    assignments    to\n\nachieve formal racial balance goals.26                 The Court held that the\n\ncitizen initiative violated the Equal Protection Clause because it\n\nforbade busing only for the purpose of achieving racial balancing\n\nin the schools and added: “It is undeniable that busing for\n\nintegration —— particularly when ordered by a federal court —— now\n\nengenders considerabl[e] . . . controversy. . .But in the absence\n\nof a constitutional violation, the desirability and efficacy of\n\nschool      desegregation    are      matters   to    be   resolved   through   the\n\npolitical      process.”27       In    fact,    the   Seattle    School   District\n\ndecision, along with then-Justice Rehnquist’s decision in Bustrop,\n\nInc. v.

The Freeman Court explained that\n\ncourts should withdraw supervision of school districts as quickly\n\nas possible because “local autonomy of school districts is a vital\n\nnational      tradition.”29         Courts    have   likewise   emphasized   the\n\nimportance of maximum local responsibility for crafting integration\n\nstrategies.30      As noted above, the Swann Court expressly approved\n\na school district’s discretion to use a prescribed racial ratio to\n\nthis end, even though it expressed doubt whether a federal court\n\ncould order the district to do the same.31\n\nStrict Scrutiny\n\n\n      28\n         Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. at 474 (assuming that school board had\nthe power to order race-based student assignment and busing, even though school\nsystem was not under court order to desegregate); Bustrop, 439 U.S. at\n1383(upholding California state courts’ desegregation order, including extensive\nbusing and race-based school assignments, as not “required” but certainly\n“permitted” by the U.S. Constitution).

On the contrary, I find it\nunfair and illogical that any plaintiff seeking admission to a magnet school that\nhas as the very reason for its existence the court-ordered effort to desegregate\nCaddo Parish Schools, may force the Board to prove, as many times as there are\nplaintiffs, the justification for its policy while the district as a whole\nremains subject to court order.

Under the circumstances of this case,\n\nviz., a school district’s complying with the court’s order to\n\nremedy a past constitutional violation by, inter alia, achieving a\n\n50/50 black-white student body in its magnet schools, we should\n\nview with considerable deference the continuation of any policy\n\npreviously enacted and unswervingly administered —— under years of\n\ncourt observation —— to bring the school district into compliance\n\nwith the court order.39\n\n      As recently as 2001, the Fourth Circuit in Belk v.

The majority takes issue with my reliance on Belk, arguing that this\ncase is inapposite because there was no prior order removing magnet schools from\nthe extant desegregation orders. My reason for relying on Belk, however, is to\ncounter the majority's holding that the Caddo Middle Magnet admissions policy was\nnot narrowly tailored at the time of its promulgation. Other considerations,\nsuch as our deference to school board authority, the school board's continuing\nduty to comply with its consent decree, and the use of race-conscious admissions\npolicies at magnet schools to prevent them from undermining desegregation in the\nrest of the district —— considerations to which the majority does not respond ——\nsupport a holding that the policy continues to be narrowly tailored.\n\n                                       43\n\faccording to race.41       The Charlotte-Mecklenburg School district had\n\ncreated separate lotteries for black and non-black students in an\n\neffort to achieve racial balance in its magnet schools.                First, if\n\na sufficient number of children of either race did not fill the\n\nquotas     for    the   children’s    respective   races,     the   Board   would\n\nactively recruit children of the opposite race despite lengthy\n\nwaiting lists for “majority” race spots.42           But then, if the Board\n\ncould not successfully recruit enough children of the targeted\n\nrace, the remaining open spots usually went unfilled.43               The Fourth\n\nCircuit concluded in two separate opinions that the Board’s policy\n\nsurvived        constitutional   scrutiny,   despite    the    fact    that   the\n\nrelevant court order did not require the school district to use a\n\nrace-based admissions policy.44\n\n     Four appellate judges held that the underlying court order’s\n\nbroad language commanding the district to take “whatever steps\n\nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system,” together with\n\nthe school district’s discretion to maintain control over the\n\nracial composition of the schools, justified use of a quota.45\n\nChief Judge Wilkinson, along with Judge Niemeyer, expressed strong\n\ndisapproval of the use of quotas and doubted that the Board’s\n\n     41\n          Belk, 269 F.3d at 316-37.\n     42\n          Id.\n     43\n          Id.\n     44\n          Id. at 311.\n     45\n          Belk, 269 F.3d at 401 (King, J. and Motz, J., concurring).\n\n                                        44\n\fpolicy would survive if it were enacted voluntarily, but reasoned\n\nthat the school district was nevertheless entitled to flexibility\n\nin how it complied with a court order:\n\n          It is true that in the early 1990's, the school\n          board in its magnet program eagerly accepted the\n          courts’   invitation   to   rely   upon   numerical\n          benchmarks.    I believe, however, that it is\n          necessary to afford a school board some latitude in\n          attempting to meet its desegregative obligations if\n          we are not to undermine the rule of law.      To do\n          otherwise leaves the Board between a rock and a\n          hard place. Namely, if the school board fails to\n          carry out the court desegregation order, it can be\n          cited for contempt or held not to have achieved\n          unitariness. But if the Board acts aggressively to\n          implement the court order, it risks facing judicial\n          condemnation and the threat of litigation on the\n          grounds that it was acting ultra vires. This is not\n          the kind of quandary into which we should force\n          institutions that are, for better or worse, under\n          judicial decree.46\n\n     We know that here, as in Belk, the district court’s 1990\n\nconsent decree did not mandate the precise quota policy here at\n\nissue, but broadly commanded Caddo Parish School Board to make\n\n“reasonable efforts” to recruit black students to its magnet\n\nschools.     In so doing, however, the court did specifically decree\n\nthat the targeted black-white enrollment ratio for the school\n\nshould be 50/50, adding that this projected enrollment would be\n\ndeemed satisfied if actual enrollment at Caddo Magnet was within\n\nplus or minus fifteen percentage points of the ratio mandated by\n\nthe court for that school.          Although the consent decree did not\n\nexplicitly     order   Caddo    Magnet    to   use   a   race-conscious   quota\n\n     46\n          Belk, 269 F.3d at 354. (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring).\n\n                                         45\n\fadmissions policy, it is indisputable that, given (1) the court’s\n\nconstitutional mandate for the Board to take whatever steps were\n\nnecessary to fulfill its obligations, and (2) the Supreme Court’s\n\nprior approval of quite similar race-conscious admissions policies,\n\nthis was a reasonable and constitutionally-acceptable means for the\n\nBoard to initiate and continue in its efforts to meet and maintain\n\nits court-ordered enrollment goals.47          Like the Belk policy, the\n\nCaddo Magnet policy was validly enacted as a narrowly tailored\n\nmeans of achieving the goals set forth in the consent decree.\n\n      Our own precedent supports affirming the district court’s\n\nruling that upholds the continued viability of Caddo’s magnet\n\nschool admissions policy.         Davis v. East Baton Rouge Parish School\n\nBoard, for example, is apposite.48            Although, unlike the Caddo\n\nboard, the Baton Rouge School Board was still under court order\n\nwith respect to its magnet school admission policy, and although\n\nthe time frame between the enactment of the decree and our review\n\nwas narrower, the gravamen of our holding the Baton Rouge magnet\n\nschools admissions policy viable was that the quota would prevent\n\nthe magnet schools from undermining desegregation in the parish as\n\n\n\n\n      47\n         See Green v.

Regarding the panel majority’s first\n\nconcern —— that the Bryant district court did not address Freeman\n\n—— I have already noted that Freeman only spoke to the district\n\ncourt’s authority to relinquish control in an incremental fashion;\n\nit said nothing about the effect of partial unitary status on a\n\nschool district’s power to craft its own policy.51\n\n      The majority’s second concern —— that the consent decree\n\nitself contemplated that the magnet schools would be released from\n\nthe decree after fulfilling their obligations —— also speaks to the\n\ndiscretionary authority of the school district to change the\n\nadmissions policy when and if it determines that it is proper to do\n\n\n\n\n      49\n         Id. at 1440. (“‘The First Circuit has specifically approved application\nof a racial quota in admissions to magnet schools to ensure that they would not\nserve as a haven for those seeking to attend a school predominantly composed of\nthose of their own race.’ We agree.”) (internal citations omitted).\n      50\n           CV No. 95-0441 (W.D. La. Jan 3, 1997).\n      51\n         See infra text accompanying notes 3-4. See also Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n489 (“A federal court in a school desegregation case has the discretion to order\nan incremental or partial withdrawal of its supervision and control.”)\n\n                                        47\n\fso. It does not speak to any obligation to discontinue the policy,\n\nipso facto, immediately on release from court supervision.\n\n     As regards the majority’s third concern, it is true that the\n\nstated purpose of creating and operating magnet schools was to\n\nenhance the quality of education imparted to qualified students at\n\nthose schools.       We recognized in Davis, however, that a primary\n\npurpose of racial quotas for magnet school admissions is to ensure\n\nthat “voluntary attendance schools not work to undermine the\n\nprogress of desegregation in the parish.”52\n\n     As     for   the   majority’s    belief    that   there    is   no   clear\n\nrelationship between the remaining deficiencies in the Caddo Parish\n\nSchool system and racial balancing at Caddo Magnet, the foregoing\n\nquotation from Davis clearly identifies a nexus between admissions\n\npolicies at magnet schools and enrollment throughout a district.\n\nAlthough the Board no longer remains under court supervision with\n\nrespect to racial enrollment projections, it does remain under\n\ncourt order with respect to one-race schools and majority-minority\n\ntransfers. Even if here the Davis nexus is slightly attenuated, it\n\nis not unreasonable to deduce that abolishing the magnet school\n\nadmissions policy would likely “undermine” continuing efforts to\n\nremedy the broader problem of one-race schools.                Freeman itself\n\nacknowledged that racial balancing in student assignments may be a\n\nlegitimate means to correct inequities elsewhere in a school system\n\n\n\n     52\n          Davis, 721 F.2d at 1440(emphasis added).\n\n                                       48\n\fthat were also caused by a constitutional violation.53             Eliminating\n\nall vestiges of prior segregation remains a court-ordered goal for\n\nthe Board.\n\n      In the universe of narrow tailoring, magnet schools have been\n\nrecognized by courts time and again as an effective and unobtrusive\n\nmeans for school districts to remedy vestigial effects of past\n\nsegregation.54      Congress itself has extolled the virtues of magnet\n\nschools as a means “to continue to desegregate and diversify\n\nschools . . . recognizing that segregation exists between minority\n\nand nonminority students . . [and that] [d]esegregation efforts\n\nthrough magnet school programs are a significant part of our\n\nNation’s effort to achieve voluntary desegregation. . .” in its\n\nMagnet Schools Assistance Program.55          And, although Caddo Parish’s\n\npartial unitary status includes Caddo Middle Magnet, the district\n\nas a whole has not been declared unitary as to remaining one-race\n\nschools, majority-to-minority transfers, and staffing. Even though\n\n\n\n      53\n         Freeman, 503 U.S. at 497. The Freeman court ultimately found that there\nhad been no showing that racial balancing was an appropriate mechanism to cure\nother deficiencies in the school system, but it acknowledged that the district\ncourt did not make specific findings and conclusions on that issue and remanded\nfor further proceedings. Id. at 498. Further, the Freeman decision did not\nimplicate the school board’s discretion to use racial balancing to cure other\ndeficiencies, but only the equitable power of the district court to order the\nBoard to do so. See id. Finally, the issue in Freeman was whether race-based\nstudent assignments could remedy problems with faculty assignments, whereas Caddo\nParish has not achieved unitary status in two other areas, including one-race\nschools and majority-to-minority transfers.

Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272, 287-88 (1977); Belk, 269\nF.3d at 355 (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring) (“Magnet schools are a widely used\ndesegregation device.”).\n      55\n           20 U.S.C. § 7231 (2002).\n\n                                       49\n\fCaddo’s magnet schools are no longer compelled to enroll majority\n\nand minority students according to the flexible ratio at issue,\n\nthey were created, and continue to be used, “to enhance the quality\n\nof education and bring about a greater degree of desegregation.”56\n\nThe magnet school admissions policy certainly “fits” this                goal.\n\nConclusion\n\n     The admissions policy at Caddo Parish was validly enacted to\n\nserve a compelling state interest and was narrowly tailored to\n\nachieve that interest, pursuant to a valid consent decree.                    The\n\nfact that the district court might no longer threaten the school\n\ndistrict with sanctions if the magnet schools do not meet their\n\nprojected     enrollments     does    not     mean   that   Caddo   Parish   must\n\nimmediately scrap the race-based admissions policy for its magnet\n\nschools as part of its broader plan to desegregate.                 The Supreme\n\nCourt has never spoken to the effect of partial unitary status on\n\nexisting aspects and policies of the desegregation plan of an\n\nextant consent decree, but has emphasized the breadth of school\n\ndistrict discretion and the importance of local control over\n\nschools.      Consequently, our deference to a locally-accountable\n\nschool board’s decision to continue the use of a race-conscious\n\nadmissions policy of which the supervising court was obviously\n\naware for as long as it              takes to eradicate the vestiges of\n\n\n\n\n     56\n          1981 Caddo Parish Consent Decree.\n\n                                        50\n\fsegregation is legally defensible despite the anathema of racial\n\nquotas generally.\n\n      Indeed,     Supreme         Court   precedent,          such    as    Seattle       School\n\nDistrict    and      Bustrop,        indicates         that    the    Court       views     even\n\nvoluntarily-adopted race-conscious policies with a substantial\n\ndegree of tolerance.              We need not go that far, but neither should\n\nwe   retrench     on   Court       precedent          by   unduly    restricting          school\n\ndistricts, especially those that continue to operate under court\n\norder.     Our review of the instant policy should be considerably\n\nmore deferential than the strictest of strict scrutiny, keeping in\n\nmind that the entire district remains under court order and that\n\npartial cessation of court supervision of this facet of magnet\n\nschool   admissions          is    not    the    equivalent          of    terminating        the\n\ncontinuing presumption of deference to school boards by the courts.\n\n      I end where I began.                 If this Caddo Magnet racial-quota\n\nadmissions policy were enacted unilaterally by the Board today,\n\nafter the court has ceased supervision of the magnet schools, I\n\ncould go along with the majority’s strict scrutiny analysis and\n\nrejection of the quota system.                   But inasmuch as that policy was\n\nenacted pursuant to court order and has been in place for years\n\nunder    that   order        ——    with   court        scrutiny      and        without   court\n\ndisapproval     ——     and    the    Board       is    still    hard       at    the   task    of\n\neradicating the pernicious effects of de jure segregation, I am\n\nconvinced that the test employed in the majority’s opinion is\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\finappositely   stringent   and    thus,   I   respectfully   submit,\n\ninapplicable in this framework.\n\n\n\n\n                                  52\n\f</pre>",
