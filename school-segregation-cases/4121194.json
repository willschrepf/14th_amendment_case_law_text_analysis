He seeks damages and injunctive\nrelief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The United States District\nCourt for the District of Delaware granted summary judgment\nto the defendants, and Parkell timely appealed. For the\nreasons that follow, we will affirm in part and reverse in part.\nWe will reverse only as to Parkell’s claim under the Fourth\nAmendment for prospective injunctive relief. 1\n\n                              I. 2\n\n        Parkell was an inmate at James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center (“VCC”) in Smyrna, Delaware, during\nthe relevant time period, which began on January 1, 2009,\nwhen Parkell slipped and fell at VCC and was injured. He\nwas transported to Kent General Hospital in Dover,\nDelaware, and examined. His chest, spine, head, and right\nhand and wrist were x-rayed with normal results, except for\nloss of normal lumbar lordosis possibly due to muscular\nstrain. He was then discharged to the prison infirmary, where\nhe was housed for approximately a week. Parkell was placed\nunder 24-hour supervision and prescribed pain medication\nand exercises. He received this treatment through a small slot\n\n       1\n          Parkell’s attorneys are appearing pro bono. We\nexpress our gratitude to those attorneys for accepting this\nmatter pro bono and for the quality of their representation of\ntheir client. Lawyers who act pro bono fulfill the highest\nservice that members of the bar can offer to indigent parties\nand to the legal profession.\n       2\n          Much of Parkell’s version of events is supported\nsolely by his own statements in verified complaints and other\ncourt filings. Because those documents were signed under\npenalty of perjury in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746, we\nconsider them as equivalent to statements in an affidavit. See\nUnited States v. 225 Cartons, More or Less of an Article or\nDrug, 871 F.2d 409, 414 n.4 (3d Cir. 1989).\n                               3\n\fin the cell door, approximately three feet off the ground, and\nwas told that medical staff were not permitted to enter his cell\nbecause of his high-security status as a resident of the\nSecured Housing Unit (“SHU”). He complained of intense\npain, but medical staff refused to treat his elbow because his\nchart did not mention an elbow injury. Staff refused to give\nhim ice for his injury, again citing his high-security status.\nHis room was unheated, and he complained. But prison\nofficials told him that he would not be moved and had to\nendure the cold because of his SHU status; they did not\nprovide any extra linens or clothing.\n\n        After his week in the infirmary, Parkell was returned\nto the SHU. He submitted a request for “sick call” for his\nelbow, which was swollen, discolored, and painful. On or\nabout January 12, he was brought to Betty Bryant, a nurse\nemployed at VCC. According to Parkell, Bryant never truly\nexamined the elbow and “would not allow [Parkell] to talk\nwhile in her presence” or to “describe his injury and\nsymptoms.” Appendix (“App.”) 96, 178. She characterized\nhis condition as mere “edema” (i.e., swelling) even though it\nwas a “massive infection,” and accused Parkell of “run[ning]\ngame” to get Vicodin, adding that she would not bother the\ndoctor because he would not “fall for it” either. Id. She said\nthat she would order an x-ray herself and that if Parkell\nneeded aspirin he could buy it from the commissary. She\nthen told officers to “get him out of here.” App. 96. Bryant,\non the other hand, claims in her affidavit that she examined\nhis elbow, saw no sign of infection, advised him to avoid\nsleeping on his arm, and ordered follow-up x-rays. She\nargues that that is corroborated by a January 12, 2009\nphysician order implementing her own x-ray order, along\nwith the x-ray reports, dated January 16, showing normal\nresults. Parkell’s elbow got worse “[o]ver the next few days,”\nand the wound ultimately opened and “squirted” pus. App.\n96. A doctor arrived to perform emergency surgery and\nprescribe antibiotics and pain medication. Testing revealed\nthat Parkell had had a staph infection. When Parkell later\ncomplained about tingling and numbness, a doctor performed\nnerve testing and told Parkell that there might be “branching\ndamage.” App. 97.\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f        Several months later, on November 4, 2009, Parkell\nwas moved to an isolation cell in a unit known as “C-\nBuilding” because of disciplinary misconduct, where he\nremained for twelve days. Parkell, like other inmates in\nisolation in C-Building, was locked in a stripped-down cell,\nwas given only a t-shirt, boxer briefs, and socks to wear, was\nnot permitted to keep rags, towels, or rolls of toilet paper in\nhis cell, and was provided with soap and other hygienic items\nonly during thrice-weekly showers. Parkell was also denied\nexercise, never permitted to leave the cell except during the\nfive-minute thrice-weekly showers, and required to eat meals\nin his cell without any opportunity to wash his hands first.\nThree times per day officers “strip searche[d]” him, visually\ninspecting his anus and genitals while he “was forced to squat\nnaked and cough loudly.” App. 99. Parkell attests that he\nhad “no contact with any other human beings” while in\nisolation, though he says that “[n]urses would arrive daily to\npass out medication.” App. 98-99. When nurses arrived to\npass out medication, Parkell showed them the infection, but\nthey said it was against policy for medical staff to visit\ninmates in isolation. His elbow again deteriorated and\nreleased pus.\n\n       There is some question as to precisely how long it took\nfor Parkell to receive treatment for his elbow injury while in\nC-Building. Parkell’s account provides little detail. He\nclaims that his elbow was not evaluated until “[a] few days”\ninto his isolation period, when a mental health worker who\nvisited him finally advocated for him. App. 98, 180. He was\nthen taken to the infirmary and given antibiotics and pain\nmedication, and nurses were ordered to clean the wound. But\n“Interdisciplinary Progress Notes” dated November 5, 2009\n(Parkell’s second day in C-Building), which appear to be\nprepared by a nurse (although it is unclear who prepared\nthem), note the swollen elbow and pus drainage and suggest\nthat the nurse took a culture, cleaned and dressed the wound,\nand called the on-call doctor, who ordered medication. App.\n959-60. Records of physician orders suggest that the\nmedication was to begin on November 5, 2009, although the\norder was not actually signed by the doctor until November\n10. Further progress notes dated November 9 note that\nParkell was “referred . . . to a provider” on November 6 but\n“[w]as never seen” and that “[t]he lab report[ed] never\n\n                              5\n\freceiving specimen.” App. 962. The preparer of those notes\ndescribes cleaning and dressing the wound, “reculturing” it,\nand “refer[ring] to provider again — tomorrow.” Id. The\nreport of the culture result lists the collection date as\nNovember 9. Records suggest that further treatment was\nordered on November 10 and Parkell’s elbow was x-rayed on\nNovember 13. Parkell agrees that his elbow was operated on\na second time on December 4, 2009.\n\n       The final series of events concerns Parkell’s physical\ntherapy for his elbow, which was ordered (presumably by his\ntreating doctor, but the complaint is unclear) to begin in\nAugust 2009. By March 2010, Parkell had received only\nthree physical therapy sessions. His therapist informed him\nthat he had ligament damage, most likely requiring an MRI,\nand that the long delay between his injury and the start of\ntherapy had caused him to heal incorrectly. He was taken for\nan MRI around June 1, 2010, and then referred to an\northopedic specialist who recommended surgery.           Two\nmonths later, there had been no “progression in treatment,” so\nParkell filed a grievance. App. 196. He was initially told in\nresponse to the grievance that there was no record of the\nsurgery recommendation, but the recommendation was later\nuncovered. The surgery was performed on March 9, 2011.\nHe then spent two weeks in the infirmary, where he was\ndenied any time outside his cell, even to shower, and required\nto receive medication and therapy through the small slot in\nthe door, which caused Parkell pain.\n\n       On March 21, 2011, his orthopedic surgeon, Dr.\nDuShuttle, prescribed four Vicodin per day for pain, but upon\nhis return to VCC, Parkell was given only two per day. One\nday Parkell received only one pill, and on two occasions he\nreceived no pills for the day; he was told that there was a\nsupply shortage. During a follow-up visit on April 13, 2011,\nDr. DuShuttle ordered more pain medication and physical\ntherapy three times per week. But Parkell received therapy\nonly once per week, and even then only about two-thirds of\nthe weeks.\n\n      Proceeding pro se, Parkell filed a lawsuit against\nCorrectional Medical Services, Inc. (“CMS”) and Correct\nCare Services, LLC (“CCS”), which were contractors\n\n                              6\n\fproviding medical care to the Delaware Department of\nCorrection (“DOC”); 3 Nurse Bryant in her individual\ncapacity; Chris Damron (another nurse employed by CMS at\nVCC) in her individual capacity — these four will be referred\nto collectively as the “Medical Defendants” — DOC\nCommissioner Carl Danberg in his individual and official\ncapacities; Warden Perry Phelps in his individual and official\ncapacities; Deputy Warden David Pierce (a supervisor of\nsecurity matters) in his individual and official capacities;\nDeputy Warden Christopher Klein (a supervisor of medical\nissues) in his individual and official capacities; Captain M.\nRispoli (a shift commander) in his individual and official\ncapacities; and Major Michael Costello (a supervisor of\nsecurity matters) in his individual and official capacities —\nthese defendants will be referred to collectively as the “State\nDefendants.” 4\n\n        Parkell alleged that his Eighth Amendment rights were\nviolated because he was provided inadequate healthcare and\nsubjected to cruel conditions of confinement. Commissioner\nDanberg was accused of renewing CMS’s contract with the\nDOC despite knowing of the inadequate care being provided,\nsigning a contract with CCS without doing due diligence, and\nimplementing policies and practices that denied adequate\ncare. The remaining DOC officials (Phelps, Pieces, Klein,\nRispoli, and Costello), as well as CMS and CCS, were\naccused of implementing policies or practices that deprived\nParkell of adequate healthcare and exposed him to cruel\nconditions.     Bryant allegedly violated Parkell’s Eighth\nAmendment rights by refusing to examine his infected arm\nand provide needed treatment, and Damron allegedly violated\nhis rights by maliciously twisting and yanking his arm\nthrough a door slot, causing immense pain and exacerbating\nhis injury.\n\n\n\n      3\n         CMS provided medical services to the DOC from\nJuly 1, 2005, through June 30, 2010, at which point CCS\nreplaced CMS.\n       4\n         The complaints named additional defendants who\nwere dismissed by the District Court before the summary\njudgment ruling, but those dismissals are not being appealed.\n                              7\n\f       Parkell also alleged that Danberg, Phelps, Pierce,\nCostello, Rispoli, Klein, CMS, and CCS violated his due\nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by refusing\nto treat him and subjecting him to conditions significantly\nworse than other inmates with similar circumstances had to\nendure.\n\n       The District Court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on all claims, concluding that: (1) Parkell could\nnot pursue damages from DOC officials in their official\ncapacities because of the Eleventh Amendment, and any\nclaim for prospective relief was rendered moot when Parkell\nwas moved to a different correctional facility; (2) his medical-\nneeds Eighth Amendment claim failed because any\ndeficiencies in his medical care did not rise to the level of\ndeliberate indifference to his needs; (3) his conditions-of-\nconfinement Eighth Amendment claim failed because the\nconditions did not constitute a denial of basic human needs,\nand the defendants were not personally involved in creating\nthe conditions; and (4) his due process clam failed because\nthe conditions of his confinement did not constitute atypical\nand significant hardship in comparison to general prison\nconditions. Parkell timely appealed.\n\n                              II.\n\n      The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1331. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       We apply a plenary standard of review to a district\ncourt order granting summary judgment. Willis v. UPMC\nChildren’s Hosp. of Pittsburgh, 808 F.3d 638, 643 (3d Cir.\n2015). “Summary judgment is appropriate when ‘the movant\nshows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter\nof law.’” Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). An issue of fact\nis material and genuine if it “affects the outcome of the suit\nunder the governing law and could lead a reasonable jury to\nreturn a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party.” Id.\n(quotation and alteration marks omitted). The party seeking\nsummary judgment “has the burden of demonstrating that the\nevidentiary record presents no genuine issue of material fact.”\n\n                               8\n\fId. In order to avoid summary judgment, “the nonmoving\nparty must identify facts in the record that would enable them\nto make a sufficient showing on essential elements of their\ncase for which they have the burden of proof.” Id.\n“Reviewing the record as a whole, we will draw all\nreasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party and\nwill not weigh the evidence or make credibility\ndeterminations.” Armour v. Cty. of Beaver, PA, 271 F.3d\n417, 420 (3d Cir. 2001) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n                             III.\n\n       On appeal, with the aid of pro bono counsel, Parkell\nhas clarified and narrowed his claims somewhat. He argues\nthat:    (1) the State Defendants violated his Fourth\nAmendment and procedural due process rights by subjecting\nhim to thrice-daily visual body-cavity searches while he was\nin isolation in C-Building; (2) his demand for prospective\ninjunctive relief is not moot because he has returned to VCC;\n(3) the State Defendants violated his Eighth Amendment\nrights by subjecting him to harsh conditions in both C-\nBuilding and the infirmary; (4) Nurse Bryant violated his\nEighth Amendment rights through her deliberate indifference\nto his serious elbow injury; 5 (5) CMS and CCS violated his\nEighth Amendment rights by turning a blind eye to practices\nthat deprived him of the full amount of pain medication and\nphysical therapy that had been prescribed; and (6) the District\nCourt abused its discretion in declining to appoint pro bono\ncounsel.\n\n       As set forth in detail below, we conclude that all of\nParkell’s claims lack sufficient evidence to submit to a fact-\nfinder, except for his claim that the thrice-daily visual body-\ncavity searches in C-Building were unreasonable and violated\nthe Fourth Amendment, for which Parkell could potentially\nreceive prospective injunctive relief. We will therefore\nreverse summary judgment as to Parkell’s claim against the\nState Defendants for prospective injunctive relief under the\nFourth Amendment and remand it to the District Court for\n\n      5\n         Although Nurse Damron is also named in the appeal,\nParkell makes no argument as to why the District Court erred\nin granting summary judgment in favor of Damron.\n                              9\n\ffurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other\nrespects, we will affirm the District Court’s grant of summary\njudgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n                              A.\n\n       Parkell’s claim under the Fourth Amendment pertains\nto the thrice-daily visual body-cavity searches conducted in\nC-Building. 6 We agree with Parkell that the State Defendants\nwere not entitled to summary judgment on the question of\nwhether the searches violated the Fourth Amendment. The\nrecord before us could support a finding in Parkell’s favor on\nthat issue. The same record could not, however, support a\nfinding that any of the State Defendants were personally\ninvolved in the Fourth Amendment violation and liable for\nmoney damages. As to injunctive relief to prevent future\nFourth Amendment violations, we are unable to determine\nfrom the record whether the issue is still live and justiciable;\nthat question must be answered by the District Court on\nremand.\n                              1.\n\n                               a.\n\n       As an initial matter, we must address the applicability\nof the Fourth Amendment to Parkell’s claim. Following the\n\n       6\n             The Fourteenth Amendment extends Fourth\nAmendment protections to searches and seizures by state\nofficials. Shuman ex rel. Shertzer v. Penn Manor Sch. Dist.,\n422 F.3d 141, 147 (3d Cir. 2005).\n        Parkell’s Fourth Amendment claim was not clearly\npled or argued while he was pro se. Although courts liberally\nconstrue pro se pleadings, unrepresented litigants are not\nrelieved from the rules of procedure and the requirements of\nsubstantive law. McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113\n(1993); Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 834 n.46 (1975).\n Pro bono counsel now representing Parkell have focused his\nFourth Amendment claim considerably, noting this legal\nprecept. The State Defendants have raised no objection to our\nconsideration of this refocused claim, and, accordingly, we\nwill consider counsel’s Fourth Amendment arguments as well\nas the State Defendants’ opposition to those arguments.\n                              10\n\fapproach taken by the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520, 558 (1979), we have previously assumed that the\nFourth Amendment applies to strip searches of inmates\nwithout so holding.        See Florence v. Bd. of Chosen\nFreeholders of Cty. of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296, 306 (3d Cir.\n2010) (“Florence I”), aff’d, 132 S. Ct. 1510 (2012). 7 In Bell,\nthe Court analyzed a Fourth Amendment claim under the\n“assum[ption] for present purposes that inmates, both\nconvicted prisoners and pretrial detainees, retain some Fourth\nAmendment rights upon commitment to a corrections\nfacility.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 545, 558 (emphasis added).\n\n        The Court subsequently held in Hudson v. Palmer, 468\nU.S. 517 (1984), that “the Fourth Amendment proscription\nagainst unreasonable searches does not apply within the\nconfines of the prison cell.” Id. at 526. But we do not read\nHudson to foreclose a Fourth Amendment claim arising from\nan unreasonable search of an inmate’s body. Hudson\ninvolved a “shakedown” search of a prisoner’s locker and\ncell, during which his property was destroyed, and the Court\nconsidered whether “[t]he recognition of privacy rights for\nprisoners in their individual cells” could “be reconciled with\nthe concept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of\npenal institutions.” Id. (emphasis added); see also id. at 538\n(O’Connor, J., concurring) (“The fact of arrest and\nincarceration abates all legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy\nand possessory interests in personal effects, and therefore all\nsearches and seizures of the contents of an inmate’s cell are\nreasonable.” (citations omitted)). The “shakedown” searches\nat issue in Hudson were categorically different from the\nbodily searches described by Parkell. Despite some of the\nbroad language in the opinion, Hudson does not directly\naddress the issue before us.\n\n\n\n       7\n          Although Florence I involved strip searches of\npretrial detainees, we noted that “[t]he Bell analysis applies\nequally to all individuals [properly assigned to the facility’s\ngeneral population] — whether they be convicted inmates,\nindicted pretrial detainees, contemnors, material witnesses, or\narrestees awaiting preliminary hearings before a magistrate.”\n621 F.3d at 308 n.7.\n                              11\n\f       The Court’s opinion in Hudson does, however, provide\nthe framework for our analysis. “The applicability of the\nFourth Amendment turns on whether the person invoking its\nprotection can claim a justifiable, a reasonable, or a legitimate\nexpectation of privacy that has been invaded by government\naction.” Id. at 525 (quotation marks omitted). In other\nwords, we must decide whether an inmate’s expectation of\nbodily privacy “is the kind of expectation that society is\nprepared to recognize as reasonable.” Id. (same). We hold\nthat it is and that the Fourth Amendment therefore grants\ninmates a limited right of bodily privacy, subject to\nreasonable intrusions necessitated by the prison setting.\n\n        We conclude that a right to privacy in one’s own body,\nunlike a right to maintain private spaces for possessions, is\nnot fundamentally inconsistent with imprisonment and is so\nfundamental that society would recognize it as reasonable\neven in the prison context. Our conclusion “necessarily\nentails a balancing of interests.” Id. at 527. Like the Court in\nHudson, we recognize that “[t]he curtailment of certain rights\nis necessary, as a practical matter, to accommodate a myriad\nof institutional needs and objectives of prison facilities, chief\namong which is internal security,” but also that prisoners\nmust be “accorded those rights not fundamentally inconsistent\nwith imprisonment itself or incompatible with the objectives\nof incarceration.” Id. at 523, 524 (quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n\n       We also note that most of our sister Courts of Appeals\nhave concluded that the Fourth Amendment has some\napplicability to bodily searches in prison. 8           And,\n\n       8\n        See, e.g., Sanchez v. Pereira-Castillo, 590 F.3d 31, 42\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2009) (listing cases) (“Although the Supreme\nCourt in Hudson ‘foreclosed any [F]ourth [A]mendment\nchallenge to the search of a prison cell,’ this court, like those\nin most other circuits, ‘has recognized a qualitative difference\nbetween property searches and searches of a prisoner’s\nperson.’”) (quoting Dunn v. White, 880 F.2d 1188, 1191\n(10th Cir. 1989)); Stoudemire v. Mich. Dep’t of Corr., 705\nF.3d 560, 572 n.2 (6th Cir. 2013); Bull v. City & Cty. of S.F.,\n595 F.3d 964, 974-75 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc); Levine v.\nRoebuck, 550 F.3d 684, 687 (8th Cir. 2008); Boxer X v.\n                               12\n\fnotwithstanding Hudson, the Supreme Court has recently\napplied the Fourth Amendment reasonableness framework\nfrom Bell in upholding the constitutionality of strip searches\nof pretrial detainees. Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders\nof Cty. of Burlington, 132 S. Ct. 1510, 1516 (2012)\n(“Florence II”).\n\n                              b.\n\n        Our conclusion that the Fourth Amendment applies to\nbodily searches in prison does not, however, speak to the\ncontours of prisoners’ Fourth Amendment rights. They are\nvery narrow. The application of the Fourth Amendment once\nagain requires us to balance interests.          “The test of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment . . . requires a\nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails.” Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559. “Courts must consider the scope of the particular\nintrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.” Id. Inmate search policies are constitutional if\nthey “str[ike] a reasonable balance between inmate privacy\nand the needs of the institutions.” Florence II, 132 S. Ct. at\n1523.\n\n        In balancing those interests in the prison context, we\nmust give considerable weight to the “place in which [the\nsearch] is conducted” — prisons being “places of involuntary\nconfinement of persons who have a demonstrated proclivity\nfor antisocial criminal, and often violent, conduct,” Hudson,\n468 U.S. at 526 — and considerable deference to “the\njustification for initiating it.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.\n“[C]orrectional officials must be permitted to devise\nreasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession\nof contraband in their facilities.” Florence II, 132 S. Ct. at\n1517. A regulation “impinging on an inmate’s constitutional\nrights must be upheld if it is reasonably related to legitimate\npenological interests.” Id. at 1515 (quotation marks omitted).\nWe recognize that “[t]he task of determining whether a policy\n\nHarris, 437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. 2006); Nicholas v.\nGoord, 430 F.3d 652, 658 (2d Cir. 2005); Elliott v. Lynn, 38\nF.3d 188, 191 n.3 (5th Cir. 1994).\n                              13\n\fis reasonably related to legitimate security interests is\npeculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials.” Id. at 1517 (quotation marks omitted).\nUnless there is “substantial evidence in the record to indicate\nthat the officials have exaggerated their response to these\nconsiderations courts should ordinarily defer to their expert\njudgment in such matters.” Id. (quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In Bell, the Supreme Court upheld a program under\nwhich inmates were “required to expose their body cavities\nfor visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after\nevery contact visit with a person from outside the institution.”\n441 U.S. at 558. After “[b]alancing the significant and\nlegitimate security interests of the institution against the\nprivacy interests of the inmates,” the Court concluded that\n“visual body-cavity inspections . . . [could] be conducted on\nless than probable cause.” Id. at 560. Specifically, the Court\ncited possible “[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons, and\nother contraband . . . by concealing them in body cavities.”\nId. at 559.\n\n        But Bell does not categorically uphold all bodily\nsearches in prisons. The facts of our case differ materially\nfrom those of Bell. In Bell, the searches occurred after\nvisitation sessions involving in-person contact with outsiders.\nIn our case, the searches occur thrice daily, regardless of how\nmuch contact, if any, an isolated inmate has had with other\npeople. We therefore must conduct our own balancing of the\ninterests in this case, taking into account “the scope of the\nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.” Id. at 559.\n\n       The “particular intrusion” at issue here is a\nrequirement that three times every day inmates remove their\nclothing and submit their anal and genital regions to visual\ninspection while they squat and cough, whether or not they\nhave had any contact with others. The State Defendants do\nnot dispute that this is the policy in C-Building. The parties\nuse the term “strip search” — as do many courts — but “strip\nsearch,” although an “umbrella term” in some contexts,\n“generally refers to an inspection of a naked individual,\nwithout any scrutiny of the subject’s body cavities,” whereas\n\n                               14\n\f“[a] ‘visual body cavity search’ extends to visual inspection\nof the anal and genital areas” and “[a] ‘manual body cavity\nsearch’ includes some degree of touching or probing of body\ncavities.” Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n.3 (1st Cir.\n1985). Our analysis concerns only the specific type of “strip”\nsearch at issue in this case — that is, visual body-cavity\nsearches, like those in Bell — and not other more intrusive or\nless intrusive types of bodily searches, which entail a\ndifferent balancing of interests.\n\n       Turning to the balancing of interests, we do not\nunderstand the State Defendants to be disputing that the\nsearches are a significant intrusion into bodily privacy. The\nCourt in Bell expressed no doubt that visual body-cavity\nsearches constituted a significant intrusion. 441 U.S. at 558,\n560 (“Admittedly, this practice instinctively gives us the most\npause. . . . We do not underestimate the degree to which\nthese searches may invade the personal privacy of inmates.”).\nAnd we have recognized that even strip searches “less\nintrusive than . . . visual body-cavity searches” are an\n“extreme intrusion on privacy.” Florence I, 621 F.3d at 307.\n\n       Regarding the countervailing security interests, we\nagain emphasize that our review is deferential and that the\nState Defendants’ burden is light, for the reasons already\ngiven. Nonetheless, on the record before us, we conclude that\nthe particular search policy enforced in C-Building is not\nreasonably related to VCC’s legitimate interests in detecting\nand deterring contraband, particularly given the significant\nintrusiveness of the thrice-daily visual body-cavity searches.\n\n       The State Defendants are unable to articulate a single\nplausible theory as to how inmates in isolation in C-Building\nwould have thrice-daily opportunities to smuggle in\ncontraband from outside their cells or use unsupervised time\nin their locked cells to transform a harmless object into\nsomething dangerous. And we cannot imagine a plausible\nscenario ourselves. It is undisputed that inmates in isolation\nin C-Building live in stripped-down cells in which they wear\nonly t-shirts, boxer briefs, and socks, are not permitted to\nkeep rags, towels, or rolls of toilet paper, and are provided\nwith soap and other hygienic items only during their thrice-\nweekly showers. And according to Parkell’s version of\n\n                              15\n\fevents, the credibility of which we do not doubt in the context\nof summary judgment, he left his isolation cell only three\ntimes per week for brief showers and had no human contact\nwhile in isolation, except for daily visits from nurses for the\nlimited purpose of dispensing medication (along with, of\ncourse, the thrice-daily visual body-cavity searches\nthemselves). He therefore had few, if any, opportunities to\nobtain contraband — and certainly not three opportunities per\nday — which distinguishes this case from the searches in Bell\nthat took place after visitations involving in-person contact.\n\n        Parkell’s daily visits from nurses and thrice-weekly\nvisits to the showers cannot justify the quantity of searches.\nIt may well be reasonable for VCC to conduct visual body-\ncavity searches of C-Building inmates after each such visit. 9\nBut at most, that would justify ten searches per week, not\ntwenty-one.      And although the State Defendants have\nsuggested that Parkell’s contact with medical personnel while\nin isolation was more extensive, they conceded at oral\nargument that the record does not evidence thrice-daily\ninteractions. In any event, in the context of summary\njudgment, we construe the record in Parkell’s favor, crediting\nthe portions that describe only once-daily visits from nurses\ndispensing medication.\n\n       The fact that Parkell, like others in C-Building, was\nbeing punished for disciplinary violations does not alter our\nconclusion. Arguably, it does magnify the State Defendants’\nsecurity interest, insofar as inmates who have already broken\nprison rules may be more likely to seek and utilize dangerous\ncontraband. But the reasonable relationship to the search\npolicy is still missing.        When dangerous inmates are\ncompletely isolated in C-Building, it is the isolation that\nprevents the smuggling of contraband. Thrice-daily bodily\nsearches have little, if any, value in that context unless the\nperiod of complete isolation has somehow been interrupted.\n\n\n       9\n          The record is unclear as to whether those visits\nactually presented any opportunity for contraband to be\nsmuggled. Indeed, Parkell describes his interactions with\nnurses as taking place through the narrow pass-through slot in\nhis cell door, under the supervision of prison officials.\n                              16\n\f       We emphasize the narrowness of our holding. We do\nnot underestimate inmates’ potential zeal and creativity for\nfinding ways to smuggle or create dangerous contraband if\ngiven any opportunity to do so. In Bell, the probability that\nan inmate would obtain contraband during a visitation was\nlow but still sufficient to justify the search policy. But here,\nthe probability is vanishingly small that an inmate locked in a\nstripped-down isolation cell in C-Building, once searched,\ncould then obtain contraband during a subsequent eight-hour\nperiod involving no human contact. As such, the intrusive\nthrice-daily searches are not a reasonable means of advancing\nVCC’s legitimate interest in detecting and deterring\ncontraband.\n\n        We do not mean to suggest that VCC must point to a\nhistory of C-Building inmates who successfully smuggled\ncontraband into their isolation cells. As in Bell, the lack of\nhistory may be “a testament to the effectiveness of this search\ntechnique as a deterrent.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. It is the\nvirtual impossibility of smuggling contraband into C-\nBuilding, rather than the absence of a history of smuggling,\nthat is relevant here. Deterrence is a legitimate concern but a\nfar less weighty concern when the conduct to be deterred is\nalready virtually impossible.\n\n        Nor does our holding concern individualized\nsuspicion. Individualized suspicion that a C-Building inmate\nhad somehow obtained contraband would, of course, still\njustify a search of that particular inmate. This case concerns\nthe implementation of general, routine search policies, for\nwhich individualized suspicion is not required. As we have\npreviously noted, “Bell did not require individualized\nsuspicion for each inmate searched; it assessed the facial\nconstitutionality of the policy as a whole, as applied to all\ninmates.” Florence I, 621 F.3d at 308. “The absence of an\nindividualized suspicion requirement in Bell is consistent\nwith the Fourth Amendment doctrine of special needs\nsearches.” Id. at 308 n.8; see also Skinner v. Ry. Labor\nExecs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 619-20 (1989) (categorizing\nBell as a “special needs” search case); Hudson, 468 U.S. at\n538 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (noting that in certain\ncontexts, such as the one considered in Bell, “the Court has\nrejected the case-by-case approach to the ‘reasonableness’\n\n                              17\n\finquiry in favor of an approach that determines the\nreasonableness of contested practices in a categorical\nfashion”).      “Under the ‘special needs’ analysis, the\ngovernment need not show probable cause or even\nindividualized suspicion for its search” and instead “must\nprove that its search meets a general test of ‘reasonableness.’”\nWilcher v. City of Wilmington, 139 F.3d 366, 373-74 (3d Cir.\n1998).\n\n        Routine, suspicionless inmate search policies may\nsweep quite broadly and still be reasonable. In Florence II,\nthe Supreme Court declined to require jails to adopt a policy\nof exempting new detainees “who ha[d] not been arrested for\na serious crime or for any offense involving a weapon or\ndrugs” from the blanket strip searches conducted before\ndetainees were committed to the general population. Florence\nII, 132 S. Ct. at 1520. The Court held that it was reasonable\nfor jails to conclude that such an exemption was\n“unworkable” because “the seriousness of an offense is a poor\npredictor of who has contraband” and “it would be difficult in\npractice to determine whether individual detainees fall within\nthe proposed exemption.” Id. The Court in Florence II\nrecognized that narrowly targeted search policies are\ngenerally not required in prisons and jails because they tend\nto be incompatible with the setting. They are often difficult,\nif not impossible, to implement without an unacceptable risk\nof false negatives (instances in which dangerous contraband\nis missed because an inmate is incorrectly classified as low-\nrisk and subjected to less thorough searches). Thus, it is\nusually reasonable for prisons to favor more broadly drawn\nsearch policies.\n\n       But VCC’s search policy sweeps too broadly with\ninsufficient justification. VCC’s security interests are not\nreasonably advanced by a blanket policy of frequently and\nintrusively searching inmates who have previously been\nthoroughly searched and held in a stripped-down isolation\ncell without human contact ever since. 10 Unlike the search\n\n       10\n         In similar cases, our sister Courts of Appeals have\nallowed inmates to pursue Fourth Amendment claims after\nbeing subjected to bodily searches when they had had no\nopportunity to obtain contraband. See Turkmen v. Hasty, 789\n                              18\n\fpolicy in Florence II, VCC’s search policy in C-Building is\nnot a blanket policy that has been reasonably selected over a\nmore targeted policy that would be unworkable. In Florence\n\nF.3d 218, 261 n.44 (2d Cir. 2015) (“[C]onsistent with\nHodges, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that they were strip\nsearched when there was no opportunity to acquire\ncontraband, including in instances where they were shackled\nand under escort, or were never permitted to leave their\ncells.”); Franklin v. Lockhart, 769 F.2d 509, 510-11 (8th Cir.\n1985) (“[T]he evidence shows that Franklin was strip\nsearched twice a day while he was confined to his cell with\naccess to only staff-issued meals and tissue. We cannot say\nthat defendants’ mere declaration that these searches occurred\n‘according to policy’ to maintain security and prevent the\nflow of contraband clearly establishes defendants’ right to\njudgment on this claim. Though defendants’ objectives may\nindeed have been legitimate, . . . [t]he search must be\nreasonable in its scope and its manner of execution.”);\nHodges v. Stanley, 712 F.2d 34, 35-36 (2d Cir. 1983) (“The\nsecond search took place shortly after the first, and Hodges\nhad been under continuous escort. Under these circumstances\nit seems clear that there was no possibility that Hodges could\nhave obtained and concealed contraband. Thus the second\nsearch appears to have been unnecessary. We therefore\ncannot say that Hodges has failed to state a constitutional\nclaim.”); Bono v. Saxbe, 620 F.2d 609, 617 (7th Cir. 1980)\n(“Guards handcuff the inmates before they leave the Control\nUnit and escort them to the visitation area. The inmates are\nseparated from the visitors by plexiglass, and guards observe\nthese visits. We do not believe that the rationale announced\nin Bell v. Wolfish, supra, justifies these strip searches. Thus,\nthe Supreme Court in Wolfish relied on the possibility of\ncontraband being brought into the prison during contact visits\nto justify the use of strip searches. Those contact visits were\nnot closely supervised by guards. Wolfish should not be\nextended to the facts of this case without a showing that there\nis some risk that contraband will be smuggled into Marion\nduring non-contact, supervised visits, or that some other risk\nwithin the prison will be presented. Since defendants do not\ndiscuss the searches in their brief, we are not in a position to\ndispose of the issue and, therefore, the district court should\nconsider it on remand.”).\n                              19\n\fII, it was plausible that any new detainee might be carrying\ncontraband from the outside world into the institution, and\ndistinguishing between high-risk detainees and low-risk\ndetainees would have been costly and error-prone. 11 But in\nour case, the only generalized risk that C-Building inmates\nwill obtain contraband arises from their limited contact with\nthe world outside their stripped-down cells. Tying routine\nvisual body-cavity searches to instances of outside contact,\nrather than an unyielding thrice-daily schedule, would seem\nto be a simple and categorical policy to implement, especially\ngiven that prison officials have the ability to closely regulate\nisolated inmates’ limited contact with the world outside their\ncells; the State Defendants have given us no reason to\nconclude otherwise. And, of course, those officials are free to\nsearch C-Building inmates individually suspected of\npossessing contraband.\n\n       Thus, construing the record in Parkell’s favor, we\nconclude that the search policy in its present form is an\n“exaggerated . . . response to [security] considerations” and\nthus violates the Fourth Amendment. Florence II, 132 S. Ct.\nat 1517. The State Defendants were therefore not entitled to\nsummary judgment on Parkell’s Fourth Amendment claim.\n\n                               2.\n\n        Having determined that Parkell presents a triable\nFourth Amendment claim, we next consider whether Parkell\nmay pursue money damages from the State Defendants, who\ndid not themselves conduct the visual body-cavity searches\nbut may have had supervisory involvement. A plaintiff\n“cannot predicate liability on her § 1983 claims on a\nrespondeat superior basis.” Chavarriaga v. N.J. Dep’t of\nCorr., 806 F.3d 210, 227 (3d Cir. 2015). We have recognized\nthat “there are two theories of supervisory liability, one under\nwhich supervisors can be liable if they established and\nmaintained a policy, practice or custom which directly caused\nthe constitutional harm, and another under which they can be\n\n       11\n         In their concurring opinions in Florence II, Chief\nJustice Roberts and Justice Alito (members of the five-person\nmajority) both emphasized the narrowness of the Court’s\nholding. See 132 S. Ct. at 1523-25.\n                              20\n\fliable if they participated in violating plaintiff’s rights,\ndirected others to violate them, or, as the persons in charge,\nhad knowledge of and acquiesced in their subordinates’\nviolations.” Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121, 129\nn.5 (3d Cir. 2010) (quotation and alteration marks omitted).\nParkell argues that both theories apply here but has not\nsupported his argument with evidence. Although it is\ncertainly plausible that some of the named defendants had\nsupervisory involvement in the searches, Parkell has not come\nforward with enough evidence for a reasonable fact-finder to\nconclude that they did.\n\n        As to Commissioner Danberg, Parkell points only to\nDanberg’s generalized admission that he “is familiar with the\npolicies of the Department of Correction” and “approved the\nDOC policies.” App. 775. “[T]o establish a claim against a\npolicymaker under § 1983 a plaintiff must allege and prove\nthat the official established or enforced policies and practices\ndirectly causing the constitutional violation.” Chavarriaga,\n806 F.3d at 223. The problem with Parkell’s attempt to hold\nDanberg liable is that he has not pointed to any evidence of\nwhere the search policy, practice, or custom came from.\nDanberg does not acknowledge any involvement in\nestablishing or enforcing any specific policies (much less\nspecific search policies in C-Building or at VCC), or even any\nawareness that the searches were occurring. And although\nthe defendants concede that inmates in isolation were\nroutinely subjected to thrice-daily visual body-cavity\nsearches, it is unclear whether this was in accordance with\nofficial DOC policy endorsed by Danberg, a policy limited to\nVCC, or even just an informal practice or custom. To\npresume that the search practices arose from Danberg’s\npolicies merely because of his position as commissioner is to\nrely on respondeat superior.\n\n       Likewise, there is no evidence linking Warden Phelps\nto the establishment of the search policy, practice, or custom\nin C-Building.      Unlike Danberg, however, Phelps has\nadmitted knowledge that C-Building inmates were strip\nsearched three times per day. If Phelps knew about the search\npractices in C-Building and had authority to change them but\nchose not to, that might constitute supervisory involvement in\nviolating Parkell’s rights. Santiago, 629 F.3d at 129 n.5\n\n                              21\n\f(supervisors liable if, “as the persons in charge, [they] had\nknowledge of and acquiesced in their subordinates’\nviolations”). But there is no evidence that Phelps had such\nauthority. Parkell has merely asserted in a brief that “Phelps,\nas Warden, w[as] responsible for ensuring . . . compli[ance]\nwith the acknowledged strip search policy,” without pointing\nus to any facts or legal authorities to support the assertion.\nReply Br. 21. We have no evidence addressing whether C-\nBuilding had dominion over its own search practices,\nfollowed orders from the warden on the matter, or was held to\npolicies delivered directly from the DOC. And we do not\nbelieve that an official is “enforcing,” “maintaining,” or\n“acquiescing in” a policy merely because the official\npassively permits his subordinates to implement a policy that\nwas set by someone else and is beyond the official’s authority\nto change. Knowing nothing more than Phelps’s title as\nwarden, a factfinder could not reasonably conclude that\nPhelps was a “person[ ] in charge” of search practices in C-\nBuilding and thereby “acquiesced” in the practice of thrice-\ndaily visual body-cavity searches. See Santiago, 629 F.3d at\n129 n.5.\n\n        Like Phelps, Captain Rispoli admits awareness of the\nsearch practices in C-Building, but there is no evidence of\nRispoli’s role in establishing or enforcing the practices, and it\nis unclear whether Rispoli had any authority to intercede.\nRispoli admits to being the “unit commander for the\nmaximum security units, including the Secured Housing Unit\n(“SHU”), which consists of Buildings 17, 18, and 19.” App.\n414. He then describes Building 18 and C-Building as\nseparate “units” and says, “The shift commander for the\nmaximum security housing units is responsible for assigning\ninmates to an isolation unit. When I am the shift commander,\nI make those assignments. . . . I am responsible for the\ninmates assigned to Building 18 isolation. But I am familiar\nwith both the Building 18 isolation unit and the C-Building\nisolation unit.” App. 415. The most natural reading of those\nstatements is that Rispoli commanded isolation units other\nthan C-Building. But even if there were ambiguity to be\nresolved in Parkell’s favor, there would still be insufficient\nevidence that Rispoli’s position gave him control over search\npolicies such that he could be charged with “acquiescence” in\ntheir enforcement.\n\n                               22\n\f       The evidence of the remaining State Defendants’\ninvolvement is even weaker. Parkell points only to Deputy\nWarden Pierce’s admission that he is “familiar with DOC\npolicies” and Major Costello’s admission that he is “aware of\nsecurity matters in the areas of the institution in which he [is]\nassigned.” Reply Br. 22 (citing App. 781-82). There is no\nevidence of Deputy Warden Klein’s knowledge of the\nsearches.\n\n       We therefore affirm the District Court insofar as it\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the State Defendants\nin relation to any Fourth Amendment claim for money\ndamages.\n\n                                 3.\n\n        Our conclusion that the State Defendants lacked\npersonal involvement in past constitutional violations does\nnot preclude Parkell from obtaining prospective injunctive\nrelief for ongoing violations. Hartmann v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr.\n& Rehab., 707 F.3d 1114, 1127 (9th Cir. 2013); Gonzalez v.\nFeinerman, 663 F.3d 311, 315 (7th Cir. 2011) (per curiam);\nsee also Argueta v. U.S. Immigration & Customs\nEnforcement, 643 F.3d 60, 70, 77 (3d Cir. 2011) (“Plaintiffs\nfailed to allege a plausible claim to relief on the basis of the\nsupervisors’ ‘knowledge and acquiescence’ or any other\nsimilar theory of liability . . . [but] are still free to pursue their\nofficial capacity claims for injunctive relief against any\nfurther intimidation or unlawful entry into their home.”);\nKoehl v. Dalsheim, 85 F.3d 86, 88-89 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(similar). In seeking a prospective injunction against the\nimplementation of an unconstitutional state policy, Parkell is\nrequired to name an official or officials “who can\nappropriately respond to injunctive relief.” Hartmann, 707\nF.3d at 1127; see also Gonzalez, 663 F.3d at 315 (proper\ndefendant is one “responsible for ensuring that any injunctive\nrelief is carried out”). He has done so. Although we leave it\nto the District Court to determine which defendants would\nappropriately be named in an injunction should Parkell\nprevail on his claim, at the very least Commissioner Danberg\nor his successor could appropriately respond to injunctive\nrelief.\n\n                                 23\n\f       The State Defendants, however, argue that the issue of\ninjunctive relief is moot. They do not deny that Parkell is\ncurrently incarcerated at VCC, nor do they contend that the\nsearch practices in the isolation units have changed. 12 Rather,\nthey argue that the issue is moot because Parkell’s Fourth\nAmendment claim arose from his temporary confinement in\nC-Building and he is no longer confined there. We agree\nwith the State Defendants but also believe that an exception\nto the mootness doctrine could potentially apply. Parkell\nargues that, in light of his current incarceration at VCC and\nthe likelihood of a return to isolation units in the future, a\nFourth Amendment violation is “capable of repetition yet\nevading review,” which makes injunctive relief appropriate.\nReply Br. 26. He requests that we at least remand the issue to\nthe District Court to consider in the first instance with the aid\nof further factual development.\n\n        The “capable of repetition yet evading review”\ndoctrine is an exception to mootness that applies when “(1)\nthe challenged action is, in its duration, too short to be fully\nlitigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a\nreasonable expectation that the same complaining party will\nbe subject to the same action again.” United Indus., Serv.,\nTransp., Prof’l & Gov’t Workers of N. Am. Seafarers Int’l\nUnion ex rel. Bason v. Gov’t of V.I., 767 F.3d 193, 212 (3d\nCir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). The exception is\n“narrow and available only in exceptional situations.”\nRendell v. Rumsfeld, 484 F.3d 236, 241 (3d Cir. 2007)\n(quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The capable-of-repetition exception is inapplicable\nwhen a previously incarcerated plaintiff has been completely\nreleased from the system through expiration of a sentence or\n\n       12\n          We note that, even if VCC had voluntarily changed\nits search practices since the lawsuit was filed, that alone\nwould not necessarily moot Parkell’s claim for injunctive\nrelief. DeJohn v. Temple Univ., 537 F.3d 301, 310 (3d Cir.\n2008) (“[V]oluntary cessation does not moot a case or\ncontroversy unless subsequent events make it absolutely clear\nthat the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be\nexpected to recur.” (quotation and alteration marks omitted)).\n                               24\n\facquittal upon retrial, because it would be mere “conjecture”\nto conclude that the plaintiff might be reincarcerated and\nsubjected to the same conditions again. See, e.g., Doe v.\nDelie, 257 F.3d 309, 313-14 (3d Cir. 2001) (plaintiff\nacquitted upon retrial). A more difficult and fact-intensive\nquestion is raised, however, when the plaintiff is still\nconnected to the system. In Micklus v. Carlson, 632 F.2d 227\n(3d Cir. 1980), we held that there was a “realistic possibility\nof reincarceration” for a parolee “because of the low standard\nfor reincarceration.” Id. at 232-33 (noting that the parole\ncommission “cannot be totally arbitrary, [but] may\nnevertheless revoke [his] parole status if at any time . . . [it] is\nof the opinion that [he] will be benefited by further treatment\nin an institution or other facility” (quotation marks omitted)).\nBut in Abdul-Akbar v. Watson, 4 F.3d 195 (3d Cir. 1993), a\nprisoner had been released from a maximum security unit\nthree-and-a-half years into his eight-year sentence, and the\nDistrict Court applied the capable-of-repetition exception,\nciting “the procedures through which inmates may be\nclassified into and out of maximum security.” Abdul-Akbar\nv. Watson, 775 F. Supp. 735, 755 (D. Del. 1991). When the\ncase was appealed, we rejected the capable-of-repetition\ntheory and held that the District Court had improperly\n“speculat[ed]” that the prisoner could be returned to a\nmaximum security unit. 4 F.3d at 197, 206-07.\n\n       Parkell’s point is well-taken that, as a general matter,\nconfinement of inmates in isolation units is hardly unusual,\nwhich we have acknowledged in other contexts. Cf. Torres v.\nFauver, 292 F.3d 141, 150 (3d Cir. 2002) (“[D]isciplinary\ndetention and administrative segregation [are] the sort[s] of\nconfinement that inmates should reasonably anticipate\nreceiving at some point in their incarceration . . . .”). But\nParkell must present more than generalities; he must establish\na reasonable expectation that he, specifically, will again be\nsubjected to the unconstitutional search practices carried out\nin VCC’s isolation units. See OSHA Data/CIH, Inc. v. U.S.\nDep’t of Labor, 220 F.3d 153, 168 (3d Cir. 2000) (placing the\nburden on the plaintiff to show that the capable-of-repetition\nexception applied). We reject Parkell’s last-minute effort to\nmeet that burden by claiming to have returned to isolation for\nfive days in June 2015, which is not reflected in the record\nand is merely asserted in his reply brief.\n\n                                25\n\f        We are also mindful, however, that the issue was\nunderstandably never explored in the District Court, 13 where\ndiscovery could have occurred and factual findings could\nhave been made regarding crucial issues, such as Parkell’s\nhistory of confinement in isolation units, the frequency with\nwhich and conditions under which VCC officials send\ninmates to isolation units, and exactly how much discretion\nofficials have to do so. We will therefore leave it for the\nDistrict Court to determine on remand whether Parkell’s\nrequest for injunctive relief in relation to the visual body-\ncavity searches remains a live issue under the capable-of-\nrepetition exception to mootness. See, e.g., Williams v.\nAnderson, 959 F.2d 1411, 1417 (7th Cir. 1992) (capable-of-\nrepetition finding was “fact-intensive” and not well-\ndeveloped on the record and therefore “best left to the district\ncourt”).\n\n                              B.\n\n       Parkell also challenges the visual body-cavity searches\nas violating his right to procedural due process. He concedes\nthat he was given notice and a hearing concerning his\nplacement in isolation. His claim is that, in addition to that\nprocess, he was also owed notice about the visual body-cavity\nsearches specifically and a hearing on the matter. We\ndisagree and will therefore affirm the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on this claim.\n\n       A prisoner holds a liberty interest triggering due\nprocess if either (1) “state statutes and regulations create a\nliberty interest in freedom from restraint that imposes an\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life,” or (2) “severe changes\nin conditions of confinement amount to a grievous loss that\nshould not be imposed without the opportunity for notice and\nan adequate hearing.” Evans v. Sec’y Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 645\n\n       13\n         The District Court was under the impression that\nParkell was no longer at VCC, but Parkell had in fact been\nreturned to VCC three weeks before the District Court’s\nsummary judgment ruling. The District Court was not\ninformed of Parkell’s return.\n                              26\n\fF.3d 650, 663 (3d Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted).\nParkell argues only the “severe changes” theory.\n\n        Examples of “severe changes in in conditions of\nconfinement” include “forced administration of antipsychotic\nmedication, or involuntary transfer to a mental hospital, or,\nfor a prisoner not convicted of a sex offense, forced\nparticipation in sex-offender therapy.” Id. at 665 (citations\nomitted).    Such changes result in punishment that is\n“qualitatively different from the punishment characteristically\nsuffered by a person convicted of crime, and ha[s]\nstigmatizing consequences.” Renchenski v. Williams, 622\nF.3d 315, 326 (3d Cir. 2010) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n       We cannot say that routine visual body-cavity searches\nare “qualitatively different from the punishment\ncharacteristically suffered by a person convicted of a crime,”\nthat they impose “stigmatizing consequences” akin to being\nlabeled psychotic or a sex offender, id., or that they otherwise\nconstitute “severe changes in conditions of confinement\namount[ing] to a grievous loss,” Evans, 645 F.3d at 663.\nParkell therefore lacks a constitutionally protected liberty\ninterest under a “severe changes” theory, and his procedural\ndue process claim fails.\n\n                              C.\n\n       Parkell raises two Eighth Amendment claims: (1) that\nthe State Defendants subjected him to harsh conditions of\nconfinement and (2) that the Medical Defendants ignored his\nmedical needs. Because there is insufficient evidence of\ndeliberate indifference as to either claim, we will affirm the\nDistrict Court’s grant of summary judgment on these claims.\n\n                               1.\n\n       A claim regarding prison conditions “does not rise to\nthe level of an Eighth Amendment violation unless: (1) the\nprison official deprived the prisoner of the minimal civilized\nmeasure of life’s necessities; and (2) the prison official acted\nwith deliberate indifference in doing so, thereby exposing the\ninmate to a substantial risk of serious damage to her future\nhealth.” Chavarriaga, 806 F.3d at 226. We need not\n\n                              27\n\fdetermine whether Parkell was deprived of “the minimal\ncivilized measure of life’s necessities” because the record\nwould not permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the\nState Defendants were deliberately indifferent. See id. We\nwill therefore affirm the District Court’s grant of summary\njudgment in the State Defendants’ favor as to Parkell’s Eighth\nAmendment conditions-of-confinement claim.\n\n       In the Eighth Amendment context, “deliberate\nindifference” is “a subjective standard of liability consistent\nwith recklessness as that term is defined in criminal law.”\nNicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798, 811 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc).\nA prison official is deliberately indifferent if the official\n“knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm\nand disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures\nto abate it.” Chavarriaga, 806 F.3d at 229 (quotation marks\nomitted).      A plaintiff “may demonstrate deliberate\nindifference by showing that the risk of harm was\nlongstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expressly noted\nby prison officials in the past such that the defendants must\nhave known about the risk.” Betts v. New Castle Youth Dev.\nCtr., 621 F.3d 249, 259 (3d Cir. 2010) (quotation marks\nomitted). But the plaintiff must show that the officials were\n“aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that\na substantial risk of harm exists, and that they also drew the\ninference.” Id. (quotation and alteration marks omitted). “It\nis not enough merely to find that a reasonable person would\nhave known, or that the defendant should have known . . . .”\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 843 n.8 (1994).\n\n       Parkell attests that during his first stay in the infirmary\nin January 2009, he was held in a cell without working heat,\nand during his second stay in March 2011, he was permitted\nno exercise and no showers for over two weeks. He also\nattests that during his time in C-Building isolation in\nNovember 2009, he was subjected to thrice-daily visual body-\ncavity searches and denied exercise and access to basic\nhygienic materials. And he claims to have been denied access\nto medical personnel during his time in both the infirmary and\nC-Building, insofar as the nurses who visited refused to\nexamine him, citing a policy against entering the cells.\n\n\n\n                               28\n\f       As evidence of the State Defendants’ deliberate\nindifference, Parkell points to little more than their\n“admissions” of awareness of certain DOC policies. That\nevidence fails because most of the policies of which the\ndefendants admit to have knowledge differ in subtle but\nimportant ways from the conditions that Parkell claims to\nhave experienced. Thus, although the defendants admit\nknowledge of restrictive policies, those policies do not\namount to cruel and unusual punishment. And to the extent\nthat Parkell may have experienced even harsher conditions\nbeyond what those policies call for, there is no evidence that\nthe defendants were aware of that.\n\n       In his affidavit, Pierce claims that there are no VCC\npolicies preventing medical staff from entering the cells of\nmaximum-security inmates housed in the infirmary, as long\nas the staffer is accompanied by two other officers; no\npolicies preventing maximum-security inmates housed in the\ninfirmary from showering; and no policies preventing an\ninmate from receiving extra blankets or clothing if the heat is\nmalfunctioning. He admits that ice and recreation time are\nnot ordinarily provided to maximum-security inmates housed\nin the infirmary but says that both would be provided if\ndirected by a doctor. He also admits that the infirmary had\nintermittent heating problems in 2009, but never for extended\nperiods. He adds that it was practice to provide extra blankets\nwhen heating problems arose, and certainly not practice to\ndeny extra blankets to an inmate who requested them. In his\naffidavit, Rispoli claims that inmates in isolation in C-\nBuilding are taken out of their cells for one hour three times\nper week, during which time they can shower and recreate.\nAccording to him, inmates in C-Building are permitted\nmedical treatment, which they can request, and are checked at\nevery shift for medical needs. In his discovery responses,\nPhelps claims that inmates in isolation are seen by medical\nstaff every eight hours and can be taken out of isolation for\ntreatment if needed. He says that soap and hygienic items are\nprovided during shower and recreation time, and while\ninmates may not store toilet paper in their cells, it is provided\nupon request.\n\n      The defendants do concede that thrice-daily visual-\nbody cavity searches occurred for inmates in isolation, but\n\n                               29\n\fsuch searches do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment\nunless they are “undertaken maliciously or for the purposes of\nsexually abusing an inmate.” Crawford v. Cuomo, 796 F.3d\n252, 258 (2d Cir. 2015); see also King v. McCarty, 781 F.3d\n889, 897 (7th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (“A prisoner states a\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment when he plausibly alleges\nthat the strip-search in question was motivated by a desire to\nharass or humiliate . . . .”); Harris v. Ostrout, 65 F.3d 912,\n916 (11th Cir. 1995) (per curiam). As Parkell does not point\nto any evidence of maliciousness, the search policy cannot\nserve as a basis for imposing Eighth Amendment liability on\nthe defendants.\n\n        The only other evidence of the State Defendants’\nknowledge of the conditions that Parkell experienced are two\nletters signed by Phelps, informing Parkell of the results of\nhis grievance appeals. But those particular letters refer to\ngrievances (nos. 191813 and 192952) that deal only with\nParkell’s requests for further medical services, not relief from\nharsh conditions. Although the letters from Phelps could\ndemonstrate Phelps’s awareness of Parkell’s medical\ncomplaints, 14 they do not demonstrate deliberate indifference,\nas Phelps is not medical staff. See Durmer v. O’Carroll, 991\nF.2d 64, 69 (3d Cir. 1993) (non-medical defendants not\ndeliberately indifferent “simply because they failed to\nrespond directly to the medical complaints of a prisoner who\nwas already being treated by the prison doctor”); Spruill v.\nGillis, 372 F.3d 218, 236 (3d Cir. 2004) (“[A]bsent a reason\nto believe (or actual knowledge) that prison doctors or their\nassistants are mistreating (or not treating) a prisoner, a non-\nmedical prison official . . . will not be chargeable with the\nEighth Amendment scienter requirement of deliberate\nindifference.”).\n\n\n       14\n          Our oft-cited holding in Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845\nF.2d 1195, 1208 (3d Cir. 1988) that the mere filing of a\ngrievance does not show actual knowledge by a supervisor is\nnot applicable, as Phelps’s letters show that he actually had\nreviewed the grievances. Cf. Sutton v. Rasheed, 323 F.3d\n236, 249-50 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding that an official who\nwrote back in response to a grievance had “played an active\nrole” in a constitutional violation).\n                              30\n\f       A grievance expressly challenging a practice of\nprohibiting medical personnel from interacting with an inmate\nmight require intervention by non-medical staff, in that it\nwould suggest that the inmate was not receiving care at all.\nBut Parkell’s grievances were different. Parkell wrote that he\n“complain[ed] often and mostly [was] ignored,” described his\nsymptoms, and asked for further treatments beyond what he\nwas already receiving. App. 492. The written responses to\nthose grievance show that the prison officials ensured that\nParkell was under the care of medical personnel and being\ntreated, and therefore that the officials were not deliberately\nindifferent. See Greeno v. Daley, 414 F.3d 645, 655-56 (7th\nCir. 2005) (“Miller reviewed Greeno’s complaints and\nverified with the medical officials that Greeno was receiving\ntreatment. We do not think Miller’s failure to take further\naction . . . can be viewed as deliberate indifference.”).\n\n        Because there is insufficient evidence to find\ndeliberate indifference on the part of any of the State\nDefendants, we will affirm the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in the State Defendants’ favor as to\nParkell’s Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement\nclaim.\n\n                              2.\n\n        We now turn to Parkell’s Eighth Amendment medical-\nneeds claim. To prove this claim, “evidence must show (i) a\nserious medical need, and (ii) acts or omissions by prison\nofficials that indicate deliberate indifference to that need.”\nNatale v. Camden Cty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 582 (3d\nCir. 2003). The parties dispute only the issue of deliberate\nindifference, not whether Parkell had a serious medical need.\nThe record would not permit a reasonable factfinder to\nconclude that the Medical Defendants were deliberately\nindifferent to Parkell’s medical needs, and therefore we will\naffirm the District Court’s grant of summary judgment in the\nMedical Defendants’ favor as to this claim.\n\n       We have acknowledged that “prison authorities are\naccorded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment\nof prisoners.” Durmer, 991 F.2d at 67. A prisoner bringing a\nmedical-needs claim “must show more than negligence; he\n\n                              31\n\fmust show ‘deliberate indifference’ to a serious medical\nneed.” Id. “Allegations of medical malpractice are not\nsufficient to establish a Constitutional violation,” nor is\n“[m]ere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment.”\nSpruill, 372 F.3d at 235. A “failure to provide adequate care .\n. . [that] was deliberate, and motivated by non-medical\nfactors” is actionable under the Eighth Amendment, but\n“inadequate care [that] was a result of an error in medical\njudgment” is not. Durmer, 991 F.2d at 69. “We have found\n‘deliberate indifference’ in a variety of circumstances,\nincluding where the prison official (1) knows of a prisoner’s\nneed for medical treatment but intentionally refuses to\nprovide it; (2) delays necessary medical treatment based on a\nnon-medical reason; or (3) prevents a prisoner from receiving\nneeded or recommended medical treatment.” Rouse v.\nPlantier, 182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n       First, Parkell argues that Nurse Bryant violated his\nEighth Amendment right to medical treatment during her\nencounter with him in January 2009. Parkell attests that\nBryant refused to let him speak to describe his symptoms,\naccused him of “run[ning] game” to obtain Vicodin, declared\nthat she was not “fall[ing] for it,” told him he could purchase\naspirin himself, and instructed prison officers to “get him out\nof here.” App. 96, 178. If Bryant had ignored Parkell’s\nmedical needs, her brusqueness might suggest that she did so\ndeliberately and for non-medical reasons. But Bryant did not\nignore his needs. Parkell claims that Bryant never properly\nexamined his injury in person even though he had a “massive\ninfection” and that she should have given him medication for\npain. App. 96, 178. But there is no dispute that the most\nserious complications of Parkell’s injury (including the\nvisible releasing of pus) had not yet appeared when he saw\nBryant. There is also no dispute that Bryant ordered an x-ray\nthat showed normal results. And there is nothing in the\nrecord suggesting that, at the time that Parkell saw Bryant, it\nwas improper to recommend over-the-counter pain\nmedication rather than to seek a prescription from a doctor.\nParticularly in light of the normal x-ray results, a factfinder\ncould not reasonably conclude that Bryant deliberately\nignored risks to Parkell’s health.\n\n\n\n                              32\n\f        Second, Parkell argues that CMS and CCS deprived\nhim of needed medical care, in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment, in two respects: (1) Parkell was twice (first in\nAugust 2009 on CMS’s watch, then again in March 2011 on\nCCS’s watch) prescribed regular physical therapy but was\nonly provided with limited, sporadic therapy, and his injury\nwas exacerbated as a result; (2) Parkell was prescribed pain\nmedication in March 2011, but CCS provided only half the\nprescribed dosage and, on some occasions, even less. Again,\nthe contested issue is deliberate indifference — that is,\nwhether “inadequate care was a result of an error in medical\njudgment” or “deliberate, and motivated by non-medical\nfactors,” Durmer, 991 F.2d at 69 — and Parkell fails to make\na sufficient showing.\n\n         The deliberate indifference inquiry is complicated by\nthe fact that CMS and CCS are institutional defendants. It is\nnot enough for Parkell to show that a medical staffer was\ndeliberately indifferent to his needs, because CMS and CCS\n“cannot be held responsible for the acts of [their] employees\nunder a theory of respondeat superior or vicarious liability.”\nNatale, 318 F.3d at 583. Parkell must impute that deliberate\nindifference to CMS and CCS by showing that they “turned a\nblind eye to an obviously inadequate practice that was likely\nto result in the violation of constitutional rights” such that\nthey, as “policymaker[s,] can reasonably be said to have been\ndeliberately indifferent to the need.” Id. at 584 (quotation\nmarks omitted). Parkell has not brought claims against\nspecific CMS or CCS employees other than Bryant. But in\norder to succeed in his claim against CMS and CCS for\nviolating the Eighth Amendment, Parkell need not name\nparticular CMS or CCS employees who were deliberately\nindifferent, as long as a factfinder could conclude that some\nCMS or CCS employee was deliberately indifferent and the\ndeliberate indifference can be attributed to CMS or CCS. See\nid. at 583 n.8.\n\n       As to the failure to provide prescribed physical\ntherapy, Parkell argues that there was no medical reason to\ndeny him therapy and the true reason was that, as a general\npractice, therapy for SHU inmates was often skipped because\nthe prison lacked enough staff to transport them from the\nSHU or were unable to transport them when certain security\n\n                             33\n\fevents occurred. 15 CMS and CCS do not deny this but rather\nargue that they are not liable because the alleged logistical\ndifficulties that undermined Parkell’s therapy were\nindisputably caused by the DOC, which is the relevant\n“policymaker” in that arena, not CMS and CCS. See Natale,\n318 F.3d at 584.\n\n        We agree with CMS and CCS. Systemic logistical\nconstraints such as understaffing, which are unrelated to\nmedical judgment, will typically not excuse failure to provide\nadequate medical care. See Inmates of Allegheny Cty. Jail v.\nPierce, 612 F.2d 754, 763 (3d Cir. 1979) (holding that\ndeliberate indifference is shown “where the size of the\nmedical staff at a prison in relation to the number of inmates\nhaving serious health problems constitutes an effective denial\nof access to diagnosis and treatment”). But there is a\ndifference between actors who are actually responsible for\nthose logistical constraints (or capable of remedying them)\nand actors who are not.          In Pierce, it was the jail\nadministration, not the individual medical providers, that was\nresponsible for the understaffing and deliberately indifferent\nto its effects. See id. at 762-63; see also Byrd v. Shannon,\n715 F.3d 117, 127-28 (3d Cir. 2013) (“[Byrd] has not shown\nthat the delays in supplying his eye drops were due to\ndeliberate indifference. . . . Under Byrd’s self-medication\nprogram, he is responsible for the renewal of his\nprescriptions, and thus, he was responsible for this delay.\nOther delays were caused by the pharmacy that provided the\neye drops. Therefore, the District Court properly granted\nsummary judgment to [prison healthcare officials].”). That\nthe DOC’s transportation practices caused SHU inmates to\nmiss needed physical therapy does not mean that CMS or\nCCS was indifferent to the problem. And even if they were\nindifferent, their indifference could not have been the cause\nof Parkell’s inadequate therapy, as there is no evidence that\nCMS or CCS had control over inmate transportation. While\n\n\n      15\n           Parkell reportedly learned this from a conversation\nwith his physical therapist, and it is unclear whether his\nstatements would be admissible at a trial. But CMS and CCS\ndo not dispute Parkell’s claims about the transportation\ndifficulties; indeed, their defense relies on it.\n                             34\n\fParkell could conceivably sue DOC officials in relation to the\ntransportation practices, he has not done so.\n\n        Parkell’s medical-needs claim also fails in relation to\nhis pain medication prescription (which implicates only\nCCS). According to Parkell’s version of events, which CCS\ndisputes, he was initially prescribed four Vicodin per day by\nDr. DuShuttle, an amount that he never received once he\nreturned to VCC. He typically received only two Vicodin per\nday, and on three occasions (March 23, 2011, March 29,\n2011, and April 6, 2011) doses were missed. Nurses told\nParkell that CCS’s medical director could modify prescription\nrecommendations made by outside consulting doctors and\nthat the missed doses were caused by a short-term shortage.\n\n       With regard to the halving of the dosage, there is\ninsufficient evidence that it was done for non-medical\nreasons, as Parkell alleges. The record is essentially silent as\nto why CCS’s medical director would have reduced Parkell’s\npain medication below the level recommended by an outside\nconsulting doctor (assuming, of course, that this actually\nhappened). There could be several legitimate medical reasons\nfor doing so, including generalized professional disagreement\nabout the appropriate level of prescription pain medication for\nmost patients. And a fact-finder could not reasonably reject\nthose explanations in favor of an illegitimate explanation\nmerely because Parkell claims to have heard other inmates\nsay that “[the medical director] slash[es] in half everybody’s\norder when you go out” to see a specialist, and to have heard\nDr. DuShuttle say that “[t]hey cut my orders every time I\nmake an order,” App. 328 — even if those statements were\nadmissible as evidence at trial.\n\n        As to the three missed doses, there is insufficient\nevidence that CCS turned a blind eye to an inadequate\npractice happening on its watch. There is no evidence that\nshortages were a common or systemic problem. And there is\nno evidence that CCS leadership would have known about\nisolated shortages in time to intervene. Parkell filed a\ngrievance on April 16, 2011, alluding vaguely to “lapses in\nmedication occur[ring] randomly,” App. 234, but even if that\n\n\n\n                              35\n\fwas sufficient to put CCS on notice, all three of the alleged\nshortages predated the grievance. 16\n\n       We will therefore affirm the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the Medical Defendants in\nrelation to Parkell’s Eighth Amendment medical-needs\nclaims. 17\n\n                              IV.\n\n       Finally, we reject Parkell’s argument that the District\nCourt abused its discretion by denying him appointed\ncounsel.\n       “Indigent civil litigants possess neither a constitutional\nnor a statutory right to appointed counsel.” Montgomery v.\nPinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498 (3d Cir. 2002). Appointing\ncounsel for an indigent civil litigant is “usually only granted\nupon a showing of special circumstances indicating the\nlikelihood of substantial prejudice to him resulting, for\nexample, from his probable inability without such assistance\nto present the facts and legal issues to the court in a complex\n\n\n       16\n          Parkell also cites a “Memorandum of Agreement\nbetween the United States Department of Justice and the State\nof Delaware that resulted from a DOJ investigation of\nDelaware prison facilities, including [VCC],” but Parkell only\nseeks to use this as evidence that “CMS and the DOC” — not\nCCS, which entered the picture later — “were on notice\nregarding deficiencies in the medical care afforded to\ninmates.” Parkell Br. 49-50. Parkell also fails to explain\nwhat “deficiencies” were actually noted in the Memorandum\nand how they would have put CMS “on notice” with regard to\nthe specific issues in this lawsuit.\n       17\n          We do not address CCS’s argument that Parkell’s\nclaim is barred by his failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies. Aside from being unnecessary to our disposition of\nthe case, the issue was forfeited because CCS did not raise\nthis issue in its summary judgment motion in the District\nCourt, and thus Parkell never had an opportunity to respond\nwith evidence of exhaustion. Ray v. Kertes, 285 F.3d 287,\n295 (3d Cir. 2002) (“[F]ailure to exhaust is an affirmative\ndefense to be pleaded by the defendant.”).\n                               36\n\fbut arguably meritorious case.” Smith-Bey v. Petsock, 741\nF.2d 22, 26 (3d Cir. 1984) (emphasis added).\n\n       District courts have “broad discretion to determine\nwhether appointment of counsel in a civil case would be\nappropriate.” Montgomery, 294 F.3d at 498 (quotation marks\nomitted). First, the court “must assess whether the claimant’s\ncase has some arguable merit.” Id. at 498-99. If there is\narguable merit, then the court should consider a range of\nfactors, including:\n\n       1. the plaintiff’s ability to present his or her\n       own case; 2. the difficulty of the particular\n       legal issues; 3. the degree to which factual\n       investigation will be necessary and the ability\n       of the plaintiff to pursue investigation; 4. the\n       plaintiff’s capacity to retain counsel on his or\n       her own behalf; 5. the extent to which a case is\n       likely to turn on credibility determinations, and;\n       6. whether the case will require testimony from\n       expert witnesses.\n\nId. at 499. These factors are “not exhaustive, but should\nserve as a guidepost for the district courts.” Id. (quotation\nmarks omitted). The plaintiff’s ability to present a case is\n“[p]erhaps the most significant” consideration and depends on\nfactors such as “the plaintiff’s education, literacy, prior work\nexperience, and prior litigation experience.” Id. at 501. We\nhave noted that prisoners have the ability to “proceed with an\ninvestigation through interrogatories, document requests, and\nrequests for admissions” but are unable to conduct\ndepositions, which are sometimes necessary to building a\ncase. Id. at 502-04.\n\n        Parkell’s chief complaint is that appointed counsel\ncould have more aggressively pursued documents when the\ndefendants resisted his requests for DOC policies and prison\nlog books. But Parkell did file motions to compel, along with\ncopious discovery requests, which demonstrated a\nconsiderable ability to pursue discovery. His discovery\nefforts were at times unsuccessful, and an appointed attorney\nmay well have done better. But that could be said of nearly\n\n\n                              37\n\fany pro se case and does not, on its own, lead us to believe\nthat the District Court abused its discretion.\n\n       Parkell also cites the complexity of the case and the\ncentrality of credibility determinations as grounds to appoint\ncounsel. But the core legal issues in this case — deliberate\nindifference and the reasonableness of searches — are not so\ncomplex that a pro se litigant would be altogether unable to\ngrasp them. Further, Parkell had significant litigation\nexperience, and his filings (including significant motion\npractice) in the District Court were coherent and\ndemonstrative of both literacy and basic knowledge of the\nmechanics of litigation. Witness credibility is indeed central\nto the case, but that suggests a need for appointed counsel\nduring trial, not at the summary judgment phase, where\ncredibility determinations are not made.\n\n        The District Court, therefore, acted within the bounds\nof its broad discretion to deny Parkell appointed counsel.\n\n                              V.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District\nCourt will be affirmed in part and reversed in part. The\njudgment will be reversed as to Parkell’s claim against the\nState Defendants for prospective injunctive relief under the\nFourth Amendment, which will be remanded to the District\nCourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In\nall other respects, the judgment will be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              38\n\f",

He seeks damages and injunctive\nrelief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The United States District\nCourt for the District of Delaware granted summary judgment\nto the defendants, and Parkell timely appealed. For the\nreasons that follow, we will affirm in part and reverse in part.\nWe will reverse only as to Parkell’s claim under the Fourth\nAmendment for prospective injunctive relief. 1\n\n                              I. 2\n\n        Parkell was an inmate at James T. Vaughn\nCorrectional Center (“VCC”) in Smyrna, Delaware, during\nthe relevant time period, which began on January 1, 2009,\nwhen Parkell slipped and fell at VCC and was injured. He\nwas transported to Kent General Hospital in Dover,\nDelaware, and examined. His chest, spine, head, and right\nhand and wrist were x-rayed with normal results, except for\nloss of normal lumbar lordosis possibly due to muscular\nstrain. He was then discharged to the prison infirmary, where\nhe was housed for approximately a week. Parkell was placed\nunder 24-hour supervision and prescribed pain medication\nand exercises. He received this treatment through a small slot\n\n       1\n          Parkell’s attorneys are appearing pro bono. We\nexpress our gratitude to those attorneys for accepting this\nmatter pro bono and for the quality of their representation of\ntheir client. Lawyers who act pro bono fulfill the highest\nservice that members of the bar can offer to indigent parties\nand to the legal profession.\n       2\n          Much of Parkell’s version of events is supported\nsolely by his own statements in verified complaints and other\ncourt filings. Because those documents were signed under\npenalty of perjury in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746, we\nconsider them as equivalent to statements in an affidavit. See\nUnited States v. 225 Cartons, More or Less of an Article or\nDrug, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520597\"><a href=\"/opinion/520597/united-states-v-225-cartons-more-or-less-of-an-article-or-drug-each/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414 n.4 (3d Cir. 1989).\n                               3\n\fin the cell door, approximately three feet off the ground, and\nwas told that medical staff were not permitted to enter his cell\nbecause of his high-security status as a resident of the\nSecured Housing Unit (“SHU”). He complained of intense\npain, but medical staff refused to treat his elbow because his\nchart did not mention an elbow injury. Staff refused to give\nhim ice for his injury, again citing his high-security status.\nHis room was unheated, and he complained. But prison\nofficials told him that he would not be moved and had to\nendure the cold because of his SHU status; they did not\nprovide any extra linens or clothing.\n\n        After his week in the infirmary, Parkell was returned\nto the SHU. He submitted a request for “sick call” for his\nelbow, which was swollen, discolored, and painful. On or\nabout January 12, he was brought to Betty Bryant, a nurse\nemployed at VCC. According to Parkell, Bryant never truly\nexamined the elbow and “would not allow [Parkell] to talk\nwhile in her presence” or to “describe his injury and\nsymptoms.” Appendix (“App.”) 96, 178. She characterized\nhis condition as mere “edema” (i.e., swelling) even though it\nwas a “massive infection,” and accused Parkell of “run[ning]\ngame” to get Vicodin, adding that she would not bother the\ndoctor because he would not “fall for it” either. Id. She said\nthat she would order an x-ray herself and that if Parkell\nneeded aspirin he could buy it from the commissary. She\nthen told officers to “get him out of here.” App. 96. Bryant,\non the other hand, claims in her affidavit that she examined\nhis elbow, saw no sign of infection, advised him to avoid\nsleeping on his arm, and ordered follow-up x-rays. She\nargues that that is corroborated by a January 12, 2009\nphysician order implementing her own x-ray order, along\nwith the x-ray reports, dated January 16, showing normal\nresults. Parkell’s elbow got worse “[o]ver the next few days,”\nand the wound ultimately opened and “squirted” pus. App.\n96. A doctor arrived to perform emergency surgery and\nprescribe antibiotics and pain medication. Testing revealed\nthat Parkell had had a staph infection. When Parkell later\ncomplained about tingling and numbness, a doctor performed\nnerve testing and told Parkell that there might be “branching\ndamage.” App. 97.\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f        Several months later, on November 4, 2009, Parkell\nwas moved to an isolation cell in a unit known as “C-\nBuilding” because of disciplinary misconduct, where he\nremained for twelve days. Parkell, like other inmates in\nisolation in C-Building, was locked in a stripped-down cell,\nwas given only a t-shirt, boxer briefs, and socks to wear, was\nnot permitted to keep rags, towels, or rolls of toilet paper in\nhis cell, and was provided with soap and other hygienic items\nonly during thrice-weekly showers. Parkell was also denied\nexercise, never permitted to leave the cell except during the\nfive-minute thrice-weekly showers, and required to eat meals\nin his cell without any opportunity to wash his hands first.\nThree times per day officers “strip searche[d]” him, visually\ninspecting his anus and genitals while he “was forced to squat\nnaked and cough loudly.” App. 99. Parkell attests that he\nhad “no contact with any other human beings” while in\nisolation, though he says that “[n]urses would arrive daily to\npass out medication.” App. 98-99. When nurses arrived to\npass out medication, Parkell showed them the infection, but\nthey said it was against policy for medical staff to visit\ninmates in isolation. His elbow again deteriorated and\nreleased pus.\n\n       There is some question as to precisely how long it took\nfor Parkell to receive treatment for his elbow injury while in\nC-Building. Parkell’s account provides little detail. He\nclaims that his elbow was not evaluated until “[a] few days”\ninto his isolation period, when a mental health worker who\nvisited him finally advocated for him. App. 98, 180. He was\nthen taken to the infirmary and given antibiotics and pain\nmedication, and nurses were ordered to clean the wound. But\n“Interdisciplinary Progress Notes” dated November 5, 2009\n(Parkell’s second day in C-Building), which appear to be\nprepared by a nurse (although it is unclear who prepared\nthem), note the swollen elbow and pus drainage and suggest\nthat the nurse took a culture, cleaned and dressed the wound,\nand called the on-call doctor, who ordered medication. App.\n959-60. Records of physician orders suggest that the\nmedication was to begin on November 5, 2009, although the\norder was not actually signed by the doctor until November\n10. Further progress notes dated November 9 note that\nParkell was “referred . . . to a provider” on November 6 but\n“[w]as never seen” and that “[t]he lab report[ed] never\n\n                              5\n\freceiving specimen.” App. 962. The preparer of those notes\ndescribes cleaning and dressing the wound, “reculturing” it,\nand “refer[ring] to provider again — tomorrow.” Id. The\nreport of the culture result lists the collection date as\nNovember 9. Records suggest that further treatment was\nordered on November 10 and Parkell’s elbow was x-rayed on\nNovember 13. Parkell agrees that his elbow was operated on\na second time on December 4, 2009.\n\n       The final series of events concerns Parkell’s physical\ntherapy for his elbow, which was ordered (presumably by his\ntreating doctor, but the complaint is unclear) to begin in\nAugust 2009. By March 2010, Parkell had received only\nthree physical therapy sessions. His therapist informed him\nthat he had ligament damage, most likely requiring an MRI,\nand that the long delay between his injury and the start of\ntherapy had caused him to heal incorrectly. He was taken for\nan MRI around June 1, 2010, and then referred to an\northopedic specialist who recommended surgery.           Two\nmonths later, there had been no “progression in treatment,” so\nParkell filed a grievance. App. 196. He was initially told in\nresponse to the grievance that there was no record of the\nsurgery recommendation, but the recommendation was later\nuncovered. The surgery was performed on March 9, 2011.\nHe then spent two weeks in the infirmary, where he was\ndenied any time outside his cell, even to shower, and required\nto receive medication and therapy through the small slot in\nthe door, which caused Parkell pain.\n\n       On March 21, 2011, his orthopedic surgeon, Dr.\nDuShuttle, prescribed four Vicodin per day for pain, but upon\nhis return to VCC, Parkell was given only two per day. One\nday Parkell received only one pill, and on two occasions he\nreceived no pills for the day; he was told that there was a\nsupply shortage. During a follow-up visit on April 13, 2011,\nDr. DuShuttle ordered more pain medication and physical\ntherapy three times per week. But Parkell received therapy\nonly once per week, and even then only about two-thirds of\nthe weeks.\n\n      Proceeding pro se, Parkell filed a lawsuit against\nCorrectional Medical Services, Inc. (“CMS”) and Correct\nCare Services, LLC (“CCS”), which were contractors\n\n                              6\n\fproviding medical care to the Delaware Department of\nCorrection (“DOC”); 3 Nurse Bryant in her individual\ncapacity; Chris Damron (another nurse employed by CMS at\nVCC) in her individual capacity — these four will be referred\nto collectively as the “Medical Defendants” — DOC\nCommissioner Carl Danberg in his individual and official\ncapacities; Warden Perry Phelps in his individual and official\ncapacities; Deputy Warden David Pierce (a supervisor of\nsecurity matters) in his individual and official capacities;\nDeputy Warden Christopher Klein (a supervisor of medical\nissues) in his individual and official capacities; Captain M.\nRispoli (a shift commander) in his individual and official\ncapacities; and Major Michael Costello (a supervisor of\nsecurity matters) in his individual and official capacities —\nthese defendants will be referred to collectively as the “State\nDefendants.” 4\n\n        Parkell alleged that his Eighth Amendment rights were\nviolated because he was provided inadequate healthcare and\nsubjected to cruel conditions of confinement. Commissioner\nDanberg was accused of renewing CMS’s contract with the\nDOC despite knowing of the inadequate care being provided,\nsigning a contract with CCS without doing due diligence, and\nimplementing policies and practices that denied adequate\ncare. The remaining DOC officials (Phelps, Pieces, Klein,\nRispoli, and Costello), as well as CMS and CCS, were\naccused of implementing policies or practices that deprived\nParkell of adequate healthcare and exposed him to cruel\nconditions.     Bryant allegedly violated Parkell’s Eighth\nAmendment rights by refusing to examine his infected arm\nand provide needed treatment, and Damron allegedly violated\nhis rights by maliciously twisting and yanking his arm\nthrough a door slot, causing immense pain and exacerbating\nhis injury.\n\n\n\n      3\n         CMS provided medical services to the DOC from\nJuly 1, 2005, through June 30, 2010, at which point CCS\nreplaced CMS.\n       4\n         The complaints named additional defendants who\nwere dismissed by the District Court before the summary\njudgment ruling, but those dismissals are not being appealed.\n                              7\n\f       Parkell also alleged that Danberg, Phelps, Pierce,\nCostello, Rispoli, Klein, CMS, and CCS violated his due\nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by refusing\nto treat him and subjecting him to conditions significantly\nworse than other inmates with similar circumstances had to\nendure.\n\n       The District Court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on all claims, concluding that: (1) Parkell could\nnot pursue damages from DOC officials in their official\ncapacities because of the Eleventh Amendment, and any\nclaim for prospective relief was rendered moot when Parkell\nwas moved to a different correctional facility; (2) his medical-\nneeds Eighth Amendment claim failed because any\ndeficiencies in his medical care did not rise to the level of\ndeliberate indifference to his needs; (3) his conditions-of-\nconfinement Eighth Amendment claim failed because the\nconditions did not constitute a denial of basic human needs,\nand the defendants were not personally involved in creating\nthe conditions; and (4) his due process clam failed because\nthe conditions of his confinement did not constitute atypical\nand significant hardship in comparison to general prison\nconditions. Parkell timely appealed.\n\n                              II.\n\n      The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1331. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       We apply a plenary standard of review to a district\ncourt order granting summary judgment. Willis v.

(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). An issue of fact\nis material and genuine if it “affects the outcome of the suit\nunder the governing law and could lead a reasonable jury to\nreturn a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party.” Id.\n(quotation and alteration marks omitted).

He argues\nthat:    (1) the State Defendants violated his Fourth\nAmendment and procedural due process rights by subjecting\nhim to thrice-daily visual body-cavity searches while he was\nin isolation in C-Building; (2) his demand for prospective\ninjunctive relief is not moot because he has returned to VCC;\n(3) the State Defendants violated his Eighth Amendment\nrights by subjecting him to harsh conditions in both C-\nBuilding and the infirmary; (4) Nurse Bryant violated his\nEighth Amendment rights through her deliberate indifference\nto his serious elbow injury; 5 (5) CMS and CCS violated his\nEighth Amendment rights by turning a blind eye to practices\nthat deprived him of the full amount of pain medication and\nphysical therapy that had been prescribed; and (6) the District\nCourt abused its discretion in declining to appoint pro bono\ncounsel.\n\n       As set forth in detail below, we conclude that all of\nParkell’s claims lack sufficient evidence to submit to a fact-\nfinder, except for his claim that the thrice-daily visual body-\ncavity searches in C-Building were unreasonable and violated\nthe Fourth Amendment, for which Parkell could potentially\nreceive prospective injunctive relief. We will therefore\nreverse summary judgment as to Parkell’s claim against the\nState Defendants for prospective injunctive relief under the\nFourth Amendment and remand it to the District Court for\n\n      5\n         Although Nurse Damron is also named in the appeal,\nParkell makes no argument as to why the District Court erred\nin granting summary judgment in favor of Damron.\n                              9\n\ffurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other\nrespects, we will affirm the District Court’s grant of summary\njudgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n                              A.\n\n       Parkell’s claim under the Fourth Amendment pertains\nto the thrice-daily visual body-cavity searches conducted in\nC-Building. 6 We agree with Parkell that the State Defendants\nwere not entitled to summary judgment on the question of\nwhether the searches violated the Fourth Amendment. The\nrecord before us could support a finding in Parkell’s favor on\nthat issue. The same record could not, however, support a\nfinding that any of the State Defendants were personally\ninvolved in the Fourth Amendment violation and liable for\nmoney damages. As to injunctive relief to prevent future\nFourth Amendment violations, we are unable to determine\nfrom the record whether the issue is still live and justiciable;\nthat question must be answered by the District Court on\nremand.\n                              1.\n\n                               a.\n\n       As an initial matter, we must address the applicability\nof the Fourth Amendment to Parkell’s claim.

Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), that “the Fourth Amendment proscription\nagainst unreasonable searches does not apply within the\nconfines of the prison cell.” Id. at 526. But we do not read\nHudson to foreclose a Fourth Amendment claim arising from\nan unreasonable search of an inmate’s body. Hudson\ninvolved a “shakedown” search of a prisoner’s locker and\ncell, during which his property was destroyed, and the Court\nconsidered whether “[t]he recognition of privacy rights for\nprisoners in their individual cells” could “be reconciled with\nthe concept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of\npenal institutions.” Id. (emphasis added); see also id. at 538\n(O’Connor, J., concurring) (“The fact of arrest and\nincarceration abates all legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy\nand possessory interests in personal effects, and therefore all\nsearches and seizures of the contents of an inmate’s cell are\nreasonable.” (citations omitted)). The “shakedown” searches\nat issue in Hudson were categorically different from the\nbodily searches described by Parkell. Despite some of the\nbroad language in the opinion, Hudson does not directly\naddress the issue before us.\n\n\n\n       7\n          Although Florence I involved strip searches of\npretrial detainees, we noted that “[t]he Bell analysis applies\nequally to all individuals [properly assigned to the facility’s\ngeneral population] — whether they be convicted inmates,\nindicted pretrial detainees, contemnors, material witnesses, or\narrestees awaiting preliminary hearings before a magistrate.”\n621 F.3d at 308 n.7.\n                              11\n\f       The Court’s opinion in Hudson does, however, provide\nthe framework for our analysis. “The applicability of the\nFourth Amendment turns on whether the person invoking its\nprotection can claim a justifiable, a reasonable, or a legitimate\nexpectation of privacy that has been invaded by government\naction.” Id. at 525 (quotation marks omitted). In other\nwords, we must decide whether an inmate’s expectation of\nbodily privacy “is the kind of expectation that society is\nprepared to recognize as reasonable.” Id. (same). We hold\nthat it is and that the Fourth Amendment therefore grants\ninmates a limited right of bodily privacy, subject to\nreasonable intrusions necessitated by the prison setting.\n\n        We conclude that a right to privacy in one’s own body,\nunlike a right to maintain private spaces for possessions, is\nnot fundamentally inconsistent with imprisonment and is so\nfundamental that society would recognize it as reasonable\neven in the prison context. Our conclusion “necessarily\nentails a balancing of interests.” Id. at 527. Like the Court in\nHudson, we recognize that “[t]he curtailment of certain rights\nis necessary, as a practical matter, to accommodate a myriad\nof institutional needs and objectives of prison facilities, chief\namong which is internal security,” but also that prisoners\nmust be “accorded those rights not fundamentally inconsistent\nwith imprisonment itself or incompatible with the objectives\nof incarceration.” Id. at 523, 524 (quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n\n       We also note that most of our sister Courts of Appeals\nhave concluded that the Fourth Amendment has some\napplicability to bodily searches in prison. 8           And,\n\n       8\n        See, e.g., Sanchez v.

They are\nvery narrow. The application of the Fourth Amendment once\nagain requires us to balance interests.          “The test of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment . . . requires a\nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails.” Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559. “Courts must consider the scope of the particular\nintrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.” Id. Inmate search policies are constitutional if\nthey “str[ike] a reasonable balance between inmate privacy\nand the needs of the institutions.” Florence II, 132 S. Ct. at\n1523.\n\n        In balancing those interests in the prison context, we\nmust give considerable weight to the “place in which [the\nsearch] is conducted” — prisons being “places of involuntary\nconfinement of persons who have a demonstrated proclivity\nfor antisocial criminal, and often violent, conduct,” Hudson,\n468 U.S. at 526 — and considerable deference to “the\njustification for initiating it.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.\n“[C]orrectional officials must be permitted to devise\nreasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession\nof contraband in their facilities.” Florence II, 132 S.

(quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In Bell, the Supreme Court upheld a program under\nwhich inmates were “required to expose their body cavities\nfor visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after\nevery contact visit with a person from outside the institution.”\n441 U.S. at 558. After “[b]alancing the significant and\nlegitimate security interests of the institution against the\nprivacy interests of the inmates,” the Court concluded that\n“visual body-cavity inspections . . . [could] be conducted on\nless than probable cause.” Id. at 560. Specifically, the Court\ncited possible “[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons, and\nother contraband . . . by concealing them in body cavities.”\nId. at 559.\n\n        But Bell does not categorically uphold all bodily\nsearches in prisons. The facts of our case differ materially\nfrom those of Bell. In Bell, the searches occurred after\nvisitation sessions involving in-person contact with outsiders.\nIn our case, the searches occur thrice daily, regardless of how\nmuch contact, if any, an isolated inmate has had with other\npeople. We therefore must conduct our own balancing of the\ninterests in this case, taking into account “the scope of the\nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.” Id. at 559.\n\n       The “particular intrusion” at issue here is a\nrequirement that three times every day inmates remove their\nclothing and submit their anal and genital regions to visual\ninspection while they squat and cough, whether or not they\nhave had any contact with others. The State Defendants do\nnot dispute that this is the policy in C-Building. The parties\nuse the term “strip search” — as do many courts — but “strip\nsearch,” although an “umbrella term” in some contexts,\n“generally refers to an inspection of a naked individual,\nwithout any scrutiny of the subject’s body cavities,” whereas\n\n                               14\n\f“[a] ‘visual body cavity search’ extends to visual inspection\nof the anal and genital areas” and “[a] ‘manual body cavity\nsearch’ includes some degree of touching or probing of body\ncavities.” Blackburn v. Snow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457687\"><a href=\"/opinion/457687/ruth-blackburn-v-linwood-snow/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 n.3 (1st Cir.\n1985). Our analysis concerns only the specific type of “strip”\nsearch at issue in this case — that is, visual body-cavity\nsearches, like those in Bell — and not other more intrusive or\nless intrusive types of bodily searches, which entail a\ndifferent balancing of interests.\n\n       Turning to the balancing of interests, we do not\nunderstand the State Defendants to be disputing that the\nsearches are a significant intrusion into bodily privacy. The\nCourt in Bell expressed no doubt that visual body-cavity\nsearches constituted a significant intrusion. 441 U.S. at 558,\n560 (“Admittedly, this practice instinctively gives us the most\npause. . . . We do not underestimate the degree to which\nthese searches may invade the personal privacy of inmates.”).\nAnd we have recognized that even strip searches “less\nintrusive than . . . visual body-cavity searches” are an\n“extreme intrusion on privacy.” Florence I, 621 F.3d at 307.\n\n       Regarding the countervailing security interests, we\nagain emphasize that our review is deferential and that the\nState Defendants’ burden is light, for the reasons already\ngiven. Nonetheless, on the record before us, we conclude that\nthe particular search policy enforced in C-Building is not\nreasonably related to VCC’s legitimate interests in detecting\nand deterring contraband, particularly given the significant\nintrusiveness of the thrice-daily visual body-cavity searches.\n\n       The State Defendants are unable to articulate a single\nplausible theory as to how inmates in isolation in C-Building\nwould have thrice-daily opportunities to smuggle in\ncontraband from outside their cells or use unsupervised time\nin their locked cells to transform a harmless object into\nsomething dangerous. And we cannot imagine a plausible\nscenario ourselves. It is undisputed that inmates in isolation\nin C-Building live in stripped-down cells in which they wear\nonly t-shirts, boxer briefs, and socks, are not permitted to\nkeep rags, towels, or rolls of toilet paper, and are provided\nwith soap and other hygienic items only during their thrice-\nweekly showers. And according to Parkell’s version of\n\n                              15\n\fevents, the credibility of which we do not doubt in the context\nof summary judgment, he left his isolation cell only three\ntimes per week for brief showers and had no human contact\nwhile in isolation, except for daily visits from nurses for the\nlimited purpose of dispensing medication (along with, of\ncourse, the thrice-daily visual body-cavity searches\nthemselves). He therefore had few, if any, opportunities to\nobtain contraband — and certainly not three opportunities per\nday — which distinguishes this case from the searches in Bell\nthat took place after visitations involving in-person contact.\n\n        Parkell’s daily visits from nurses and thrice-weekly\nvisits to the showers cannot justify the quantity of searches.\nIt may well be reasonable for VCC to conduct visual body-\ncavity searches of C-Building inmates after each such visit. 9\nBut at most, that would justify ten searches per week, not\ntwenty-one.      And although the State Defendants have\nsuggested that Parkell’s contact with medical personnel while\nin isolation was more extensive, they conceded at oral\nargument that the record does not evidence thrice-daily\ninteractions. In any event, in the context of summary\njudgment, we construe the record in Parkell’s favor, crediting\nthe portions that describe only once-daily visits from nurses\ndispensing medication.\n\n       The fact that Parkell, like others in C-Building, was\nbeing punished for disciplinary violations does not alter our\nconclusion. Arguably, it does magnify the State Defendants’\nsecurity interest, insofar as inmates who have already broken\nprison rules may be more likely to seek and utilize dangerous\ncontraband. But the reasonable relationship to the search\npolicy is still missing.        When dangerous inmates are\ncompletely isolated in C-Building, it is the isolation that\nprevents the smuggling of contraband. Thrice-daily bodily\nsearches have little, if any, value in that context unless the\nperiod of complete isolation has somehow been interrupted.\n\n\n       9\n          The record is unclear as to whether those visits\nactually presented any opportunity for contraband to be\nsmuggled. Indeed, Parkell describes his interactions with\nnurses as taking place through the narrow pass-through slot in\nhis cell door, under the supervision of prison officials.\n                              16\n\f       We emphasize the narrowness of our holding. We do\nnot underestimate inmates’ potential zeal and creativity for\nfinding ways to smuggle or create dangerous contraband if\ngiven any opportunity to do so. In Bell, the probability that\nan inmate would obtain contraband during a visitation was\nlow but still sufficient to justify the search policy. But here,\nthe probability is vanishingly small that an inmate locked in a\nstripped-down isolation cell in C-Building, once searched,\ncould then obtain contraband during a subsequent eight-hour\nperiod involving no human contact. As such, the intrusive\nthrice-daily searches are not a reasonable means of advancing\nVCC’s legitimate interest in detecting and deterring\ncontraband.\n\n        We do not mean to suggest that VCC must point to a\nhistory of C-Building inmates who successfully smuggled\ncontraband into their isolation cells. As in Bell, the lack of\nhistory may be “a testament to the effectiveness of this search\ntechnique as a deterrent.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. It is the\nvirtual impossibility of smuggling contraband into C-\nBuilding, rather than the absence of a history of smuggling,\nthat is relevant here. Deterrence is a legitimate concern but a\nfar less weighty concern when the conduct to be deterred is\nalready virtually impossible.\n\n        Nor does our holding concern individualized\nsuspicion. Individualized suspicion that a C-Building inmate\nhad somehow obtained contraband would, of course, still\njustify a search of that particular inmate. This case concerns\nthe implementation of general, routine search policies, for\nwhich individualized suspicion is not required. As we have\npreviously noted, “Bell did not require individualized\nsuspicion for each inmate searched; it assessed the facial\nconstitutionality of the policy as a whole, as applied to all\ninmates.” Florence I, 621 F.3d at 308. “The absence of an\nindividualized suspicion requirement in Bell is consistent\nwith the Fourth Amendment doctrine of special needs\nsearches.” Id. at 308 n.8; see also Skinner v.

In Florence II,\nthe Supreme Court declined to require jails to adopt a policy\nof exempting new detainees “who ha[d] not been arrested for\na serious crime or for any offense involving a weapon or\ndrugs” from the blanket strip searches conducted before\ndetainees were committed to the general population. Florence\nII, 132 S. Ct. at 1520. The Court held that it was reasonable\nfor jails to conclude that such an exemption was\n“unworkable” because “the seriousness of an offense is a poor\npredictor of who has contraband” and “it would be difficult in\npractice to determine whether individual detainees fall within\nthe proposed exemption.” Id. The Court in Florence II\nrecognized that narrowly targeted search policies are\ngenerally not required in prisons and jails because they tend\nto be incompatible with the setting. They are often difficult,\nif not impossible, to implement without an unacceptable risk\nof false negatives (instances in which dangerous contraband\nis missed because an inmate is incorrectly classified as low-\nrisk and subjected to less thorough searches). Thus, it is\nusually reasonable for prisons to favor more broadly drawn\nsearch policies.\n\n       But VCC’s search policy sweeps too broadly with\ninsufficient justification.

Thus,\nthe Supreme Court in Wolfish relied on the possibility of\ncontraband being brought into the prison during contact visits\nto justify the use of strip searches.

Tying routine\nvisual body-cavity searches to instances of outside contact,\nrather than an unyielding thrice-daily schedule, would seem\nto be a simple and categorical policy to implement, especially\ngiven that prison officials have the ability to closely regulate\nisolated inmates’ limited contact with the world outside their\ncells; the State Defendants have given us no reason to\nconclude otherwise. And, of course, those officials are free to\nsearch C-Building inmates individually suspected of\npossessing contraband.\n\n       Thus, construing the record in Parkell’s favor, we\nconclude that the search policy in its present form is an\n“exaggerated . . . response to [security] considerations” and\nthus violates the Fourth Amendment.

Although it is\ncertainly plausible that some of the named defendants had\nsupervisory involvement in the searches, Parkell has not come\nforward with enough evidence for a reasonable fact-finder to\nconclude that they did.\n\n        As to Commissioner Danberg, Parkell points only to\nDanberg’s generalized admission that he “is familiar with the\npolicies of the Department of Correction” and “approved the\nDOC policies.” App. 775. “[T]o establish a claim against a\npolicymaker under § 1983 a plaintiff must allege and prove\nthat the official established or enforced policies and practices\ndirectly causing the constitutional violation.” Chavarriaga,\n806 F.3d at 223. The problem with Parkell’s attempt to hold\nDanberg liable is that he has not pointed to any evidence of\nwhere the search policy, practice, or custom came from.\nDanberg does not acknowledge any involvement in\nestablishing or enforcing any specific policies (much less\nspecific search policies in C-Building or at VCC), or even any\nawareness that the searches were occurring. And although\nthe defendants concede that inmates in isolation were\nroutinely subjected to thrice-daily visual body-cavity\nsearches, it is unclear whether this was in accordance with\nofficial DOC policy endorsed by Danberg, a policy limited to\nVCC, or even just an informal practice or custom. To\npresume that the search practices arose from Danberg’s\npolicies merely because of his position as commissioner is to\nrely on respondeat superior.\n\n       Likewise, there is no evidence linking Warden Phelps\nto the establishment of the search policy, practice, or custom\nin C-Building.      Unlike Danberg, however, Phelps has\nadmitted knowledge that C-Building inmates were strip\nsearched three times per day. If Phelps knew about the search\npractices in C-Building and had authority to change them but\nchose not to, that might constitute supervisory involvement in\nviolating Parkell’s rights. Santiago, 629 F.3d at 129 n.5\n\n                              21\n\f(supervisors liable if, “as the persons in charge, [they] had\nknowledge of and acquiesced in their subordinates’\nviolations”). But there is no evidence that Phelps had such\nauthority. Parkell has merely asserted in a brief that “Phelps,\nas Warden, w[as] responsible for ensuring . . . compli[ance]\nwith the acknowledged strip search policy,” without pointing\nus to any facts or legal authorities to support the assertion.\nReply Br. 21. We have no evidence addressing whether C-\nBuilding had dominion over its own search practices,\nfollowed orders from the warden on the matter, or was held to\npolicies delivered directly from the DOC. And we do not\nbelieve that an official is “enforcing,” “maintaining,” or\n“acquiescing in” a policy merely because the official\npassively permits his subordinates to implement a policy that\nwas set by someone else and is beyond the official’s authority\nto change. Knowing nothing more than Phelps’s title as\nwarden, a factfinder could not reasonably conclude that\nPhelps was a “person[ ] in charge” of search practices in C-\nBuilding and thereby “acquiesced” in the practice of thrice-\ndaily visual body-cavity searches. See Santiago, 629 F.3d at\n129 n.5.\n\n        Like Phelps, Captain Rispoli admits awareness of the\nsearch practices in C-Building, but there is no evidence of\nRispoli’s role in establishing or enforcing the practices, and it\nis unclear whether Rispoli had any authority to intercede.\nRispoli admits to being the “unit commander for the\nmaximum security units, including the Secured Housing Unit\n(“SHU”), which consists of Buildings 17, 18, and 19.” App.\n414. He then describes Building 18 and C-Building as\nseparate “units” and says, “The shift commander for the\nmaximum security housing units is responsible for assigning\ninmates to an isolation unit. When I am the shift commander,\nI make those assignments. . . . I am responsible for the\ninmates assigned to Building 18 isolation. But I am familiar\nwith both the Building 18 isolation unit and the C-Building\nisolation unit.” App. 415. The most natural reading of those\nstatements is that Rispoli commanded isolation units other\nthan C-Building. But even if there were ambiguity to be\nresolved in Parkell’s favor, there would still be insufficient\nevidence that Rispoli’s position gave him control over search\npolicies such that he could be charged with “acquiescence” in\ntheir enforcement.\n\n                               22\n\f       The evidence of the remaining State Defendants’\ninvolvement is even weaker. Parkell points only to Deputy\nWarden Pierce’s admission that he is “familiar with DOC\npolicies” and Major Costello’s admission that he is “aware of\nsecurity matters in the areas of the institution in which he [is]\nassigned.” Reply Br. 22 (citing App. 781-82). There is no\nevidence of Deputy Warden Klein’s knowledge of the\nsearches.\n\n       We therefore affirm the District Court insofar as it\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the State Defendants\nin relation to any Fourth Amendment claim for money\ndamages.\n\n                                 3.\n\n        Our conclusion that the State Defendants lacked\npersonal involvement in past constitutional violations does\nnot preclude Parkell from obtaining prospective injunctive\nrelief for ongoing violations.

He has done so.

We agree\nwith the State Defendants but also believe that an exception\nto the mootness doctrine could potentially apply.

We will therefore leave it for the\nDistrict Court to determine on remand whether Parkell’s\nrequest for injunctive relief in relation to the visual body-\ncavity searches remains a live issue under the capable-of-\nrepetition exception to mootness.

He also\nattests that during his time in C-Building isolation in\nNovember 2009, he was subjected to thrice-daily visual body-\ncavity searches and denied exercise and access to basic\nhygienic materials. And he claims to have been denied access\nto medical personnel during his time in both the infirmary and\nC-Building, insofar as the nurses who visited refused to\nexamine him, citing a policy against entering the cells.\n\n\n\n                               28\n\f       As evidence of the State Defendants’ deliberate\nindifference, Parkell points to little more than their\n“admissions” of awareness of certain DOC policies. That\nevidence fails because most of the policies of which the\ndefendants admit to have knowledge differ in subtle but\nimportant ways from the conditions that Parkell claims to\nhave experienced. Thus, although the defendants admit\nknowledge of restrictive policies, those policies do not\namount to cruel and unusual punishment. And to the extent\nthat Parkell may have experienced even harsher conditions\nbeyond what those policies call for, there is no evidence that\nthe defendants were aware of that.\n\n       In his affidavit, Pierce claims that there are no VCC\npolicies preventing medical staff from entering the cells of\nmaximum-security inmates housed in the infirmary, as long\nas the staffer is accompanied by two other officers; no\npolicies preventing maximum-security inmates housed in the\ninfirmary from showering; and no policies preventing an\ninmate from receiving extra blankets or clothing if the heat is\nmalfunctioning. He admits that ice and recreation time are\nnot ordinarily provided to maximum-security inmates housed\nin the infirmary but says that both would be provided if\ndirected by a doctor. He also admits that the infirmary had\nintermittent heating problems in 2009, but never for extended\nperiods. He adds that it was practice to provide extra blankets\nwhen heating problems arose, and certainly not practice to\ndeny extra blankets to an inmate who requested them. In his\naffidavit, Rispoli claims that inmates in isolation in C-\nBuilding are taken out of their cells for one hour three times\nper week, during which time they can shower and recreate.\nAccording to him, inmates in C-Building are permitted\nmedical treatment, which they can request, and are checked at\nevery shift for medical needs. In his discovery responses,\nPhelps claims that inmates in isolation are seen by medical\nstaff every eight hours and can be taken out of isolation for\ntreatment if needed. He says that soap and hygienic items are\nprovided during shower and recreation time, and while\ninmates may not store toilet paper in their cells, it is provided\nupon request.\n\n      The defendants do concede that thrice-daily visual-\nbody cavity searches occurred for inmates in isolation, but\n\n                               29\n\fsuch searches do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment\nunless they are “undertaken maliciously or for the purposes of\nsexually abusing an inmate.” Crawford v.

The parties dispute only the issue of deliberate\nindifference, not whether Parkell had a serious medical need.\nThe record would not permit a reasonable factfinder to\nconclude that the Medical Defendants were deliberately\nindifferent to Parkell’s medical needs, and therefore we will\naffirm the District Court’s grant of summary judgment in the\nMedical Defendants’ favor as to this claim.\n\n       We have acknowledged that “prison authorities are\naccorded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment\nof prisoners.” Durmer, 991 F.2d at 67. A prisoner bringing a\nmedical-needs claim “must show more than negligence; he\n\n                              31\n\fmust show ‘deliberate indifference’ to a serious medical\nneed.” Id. “Allegations of medical malpractice are not\nsufficient to establish a Constitutional violation,” nor is\n“[m]ere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment.”\nSpruill, 372 F.3d at 235. A “failure to provide adequate care .\n. .

Durmer, 991 F.2d at 69. “We have found\n‘deliberate indifference’ in a variety of circumstances,\nincluding where the prison official (1) knows of a prisoner’s\nneed for medical treatment but intentionally refuses to\nprovide it; (2) delays necessary medical treatment based on a\nnon-medical reason; or (3) prevents a prisoner from receiving\nneeded or recommended medical treatment.” Rouse v.\nPlantier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765002\"><a href=\"/opinion/765002/darryl-leon-rouse-v-william-plantier-acting-superintendent-of-adtc/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n       First, Parkell argues that Nurse Bryant violated his\nEighth Amendment right to medical treatment during her\nencounter with him in January 2009. Parkell attests that\nBryant refused to let him speak to describe his symptoms,\naccused him of “run[ning] game” to obtain Vicodin, declared\nthat she was not “fall[ing] for it,” told him he could purchase\naspirin himself, and instructed prison officers to “get him out\nof here.” App. 96, 178. If Bryant had ignored Parkell’s\nmedical needs, her brusqueness might suggest that she did so\ndeliberately and for non-medical reasons. But Bryant did not\nignore his needs. Parkell claims that Bryant never properly\nexamined his injury in person even though he had a “massive\ninfection” and that she should have given him medication for\npain. App. 96, 178. But there is no dispute that the most\nserious complications of Parkell’s injury (including the\nvisible releasing of pus) had not yet appeared when he saw\nBryant. There is also no dispute that Bryant ordered an x-ray\nthat showed normal results. And there is nothing in the\nrecord suggesting that, at the time that Parkell saw Bryant, it\nwas improper to recommend over-the-counter pain\nmedication rather than to seek a prescription from a doctor.\nParticularly in light of the normal x-ray results, a factfinder\ncould not reasonably conclude that Bryant deliberately\nignored risks to Parkell’s health.\n\n\n\n                              32\n\f        Second, Parkell argues that CMS and CCS deprived\nhim of needed medical care, in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment, in two respects: (1) Parkell was twice (first in\nAugust 2009 on CMS’s watch, then again in March 2011 on\nCCS’s watch) prescribed regular physical therapy but was\nonly provided with limited, sporadic therapy, and his injury\nwas exacerbated as a result; (2) Parkell was prescribed pain\nmedication in March 2011, but CCS provided only half the\nprescribed dosage and, on some occasions, even less. Again,\nthe contested issue is deliberate indifference — that is,\nwhether “inadequate care was a result of an error in medical\njudgment” or “deliberate, and motivated by non-medical\nfactors,” Durmer, 991 F.2d at 69 — and Parkell fails to make\na sufficient showing.\n\n         The deliberate indifference inquiry is complicated by\nthe fact that CMS and CCS are institutional defendants. It is\nnot enough for Parkell to show that a medical staffer was\ndeliberately indifferent to his needs, because CMS and CCS\n“cannot be held responsible for the acts of [their] employees\nunder a theory of respondeat superior or vicarious liability.”\nNatale, 318 F.3d at 583. Parkell must impute that deliberate\nindifference to CMS and CCS by showing that they “turned a\nblind eye to an obviously inadequate practice that was likely\nto result in the violation of constitutional rights” such that\nthey, as “policymaker[s,] can reasonably be said to have been\ndeliberately indifferent to the need.” Id. at 584 (quotation\nmarks omitted). Parkell has not brought claims against\nspecific CMS or CCS employees other than Bryant. But in\norder to succeed in his claim against CMS and CCS for\nviolating the Eighth Amendment, Parkell need not name\nparticular CMS or CCS employees who were deliberately\nindifferent, as long as a factfinder could conclude that some\nCMS or CCS employee was deliberately indifferent and the\ndeliberate indifference can be attributed to CMS or CCS. See\nid. at 583 n.8.\n\n       As to the failure to provide prescribed physical\ntherapy, Parkell argues that there was no medical reason to\ndeny him therapy and the true reason was that, as a general\npractice, therapy for SHU inmates was often skipped because\nthe prison lacked enough staff to transport them from the\nSHU or were unable to transport them when certain security\n\n                             33\n\fevents occurred. 15 CMS and CCS do not deny this but rather\nargue that they are not liable because the alleged logistical\ndifficulties that undermined Parkell’s therapy were\nindisputably caused by the DOC, which is the relevant\n“policymaker” in that arena, not CMS and CCS. See Natale,\n318 F.3d at 584.\n\n        We agree with CMS and CCS. Systemic logistical\nconstraints such as understaffing, which are unrelated to\nmedical judgment, will typically not excuse failure to provide\nadequate medical care. See Inmates of Allegheny Cty. Jail v.\nPierce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373419\"><a href=\"/opinion/373419/inmates-of-the-allegheny-county-jail-thomas-price-bey-arthur-goslee/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 763 (3d Cir. 1979) (holding that\ndeliberate indifference is shown “where the size of the\nmedical staff at a prison in relation to the number of inmates\nhaving serious health problems constitutes an effective denial\nof access to diagnosis and treatment”). But there is a\ndifference between actors who are actually responsible for\nthose logistical constraints (or capable of remedying them)\nand actors who are not.          In Pierce, it was the jail\nadministration, not the individual medical providers, that was\nresponsible for the understaffing and deliberately indifferent\nto its effects. See id. at 762-63; see also Byrd v. Shannon,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 127-28 (3d Cir. 2013) (“[Byrd] has not shown\nthat the delays in supplying his eye drops were due to\ndeliberate indifference. . . . Under Byrd’s self-medication\nprogram, he is responsible for the renewal of his\nprescriptions, and thus, he was responsible for this delay.\nOther delays were caused by the pharmacy that provided the\neye drops. Therefore, the District Court properly granted\nsummary judgment to [prison healthcare officials].”). That\nthe DOC’s transportation practices caused SHU inmates to\nmiss needed physical therapy does not mean that CMS or\nCCS was indifferent to the problem. And even if they were\nindifferent, their indifference could not have been the cause\nof Parkell’s inadequate therapy, as there is no evidence that\nCMS or CCS had control over inmate transportation. While\n\n\n      15\n           Parkell reportedly learned this from a conversation\nwith his physical therapist, and it is unclear whether his\nstatements would be admissible at a trial. But CMS and CCS\ndo not dispute Parkell’s claims about the transportation\ndifficulties; indeed, their defense relies on it.\n                             34\n\fParkell could conceivably sue DOC officials in relation to the\ntransportation practices, he has not done so.\n\n        Parkell’s medical-needs claim also fails in relation to\nhis pain medication prescription (which implicates only\nCCS). According to Parkell’s version of events, which CCS\ndisputes, he was initially prescribed four Vicodin per day by\nDr. DuShuttle, an amount that he never received once he\nreturned to VCC. He typically received only two Vicodin per\nday, and on three occasions (March 23, 2011, March 29,\n2011, and April 6, 2011) doses were missed. Nurses told\nParkell that CCS’s medical director could modify prescription\nrecommendations made by outside consulting doctors and\nthat the missed doses were caused by a short-term shortage.\n\n       With regard to the halving of the dosage, there is\ninsufficient evidence that it was done for non-medical\nreasons, as Parkell alleges. The record is essentially silent as\nto why CCS’s medical director would have reduced Parkell’s\npain medication below the level recommended by an outside\nconsulting doctor (assuming, of course, that this actually\nhappened). There could be several legitimate medical reasons\nfor doing so, including generalized professional disagreement\nabout the appropriate level of prescription pain medication for\nmost patients. And a fact-finder could not reasonably reject\nthose explanations in favor of an illegitimate explanation\nmerely because Parkell claims to have heard other inmates\nsay that “[the medical director] slash[es] in half everybody’s\norder when you go out” to see a specialist, and to have heard\nDr. DuShuttle say that “[t]hey cut my orders every time I\nmake an order,” App. 328 — even if those statements were\nadmissible as evidence at trial.\n\n        As to the three missed doses, there is insufficient\nevidence that CCS turned a blind eye to an inadequate\npractice happening on its watch. There is no evidence that\nshortages were a common or systemic problem. And there is\nno evidence that CCS leadership would have known about\nisolated shortages in time to intervene. Parkell filed a\ngrievance on April 16, 2011, alluding vaguely to “lapses in\nmedication occur[ring] randomly,” App. 234, but even if that\n\n\n\n                              35\n\fwas sufficient to put CCS on notice, all three of the alleged\nshortages predated the grievance. 16\n\n       We will therefore affirm the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the Medical Defendants in\nrelation to Parkell’s Eighth Amendment medical-needs\nclaims. 17\n\n                              IV.\n\n       Finally, we reject Parkell’s argument that the District\nCourt abused its discretion by denying him appointed\ncounsel.\n       “Indigent civil litigants possess neither a constitutional\nnor a statutory right to appointed counsel.” Montgomery v.\nPinchak, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778087\"><a href=\"/opinion/778087/jeffery-montgomery-v-steven-pinchak-al-ortiz-terry-moore-c-naficy-mr/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 (3d Cir. 2002).

Parkell also fails to explain\nwhat “deficiencies” were actually noted in the Memorandum\nand how they would have put CMS “on notice” with regard to\nthe specific issues in this lawsuit.\n       17\n          We do not address CCS’s argument that Parkell’s\nclaim is barred by his failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies. Aside from being unnecessary to our disposition of\nthe case, the issue was forfeited because CCS did not raise\nthis issue in its summary judgment motion in the District\nCourt, and thus Parkell never had an opportunity to respond\nwith evidence of exhaustion.

First, the court “must assess whether the claimant’s\ncase has some arguable merit.” Id. at 498-99. If there is\narguable merit, then the court should consider a range of\nfactors, including:\n\n       1. the plaintiff’s ability to present his or her\n       own case; 2. the difficulty of the particular\n       legal issues; 3. the degree to which factual\n       investigation will be necessary and the ability\n       of the plaintiff to pursue investigation; 4. the\n       plaintiff’s capacity to retain counsel on his or\n       her own behalf; 5. the extent to which a case is\n       likely to turn on credibility determinations, and;\n       6. whether the case will require testimony from\n       expert witnesses.\n\nId. at 499. These factors are “not exhaustive, but should\nserve as a guidepost for the district courts.” Id. (quotation\nmarks omitted). The plaintiff’s ability to present a case is\n“[p]erhaps the most significant” consideration and depends on\nfactors such as “the plaintiff’s education, literacy, prior work\nexperience, and prior litigation experience.” Id. at 501. We\nhave noted that prisoners have the ability to “proceed with an\ninvestigation through interrogatories, document requests, and\nrequests for admissions” but are unable to conduct\ndepositions, which are sometimes necessary to building a\ncase. Id. at 502-04.\n\n        Parkell’s chief complaint is that appointed counsel\ncould have more aggressively pursued documents when the\ndefendants resisted his requests for DOC policies and prison\nlog books. But Parkell did file motions to compel, along with\ncopious discovery requests, which demonstrated a\nconsiderable ability to pursue discovery. His discovery\nefforts were at times unsuccessful, and an appointed attorney\nmay well have done better. But that could be said of nearly\n\n\n                              37\n\fany pro se case and does not, on its own, lead us to believe\nthat the District Court abused its discretion.\n\n       Parkell also cites the complexity of the case and the\ncentrality of credibility determinations as grounds to appoint\ncounsel. But the core legal issues in this case — deliberate\nindifference and the reasonableness of searches — are not so\ncomplex that a pro se litigant would be altogether unable to\ngrasp them. Further, Parkell had significant litigation\nexperience, and his filings (including significant motion\npractice) in the District Court were coherent and\ndemonstrative of both literacy and basic knowledge of the\nmechanics of litigation. Witness credibility is indeed central\nto the case, but that suggests a need for appointed counsel\nduring trial, not at the summary judgment phase, where\ncredibility determinations are not made.\n\n        The District Court, therefore, acted within the bounds\nof its broad discretion to deny Parkell appointed counsel.\n\n                              V.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District\nCourt will be affirmed in part and reversed in part. The\njudgment will be reversed as to Parkell’s claim against the\nState Defendants for prospective injunctive relief under the\nFourth Amendment, which will be remanded to the District\nCourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In\nall other respects, the judgment will be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              38\n\f</pre>",
