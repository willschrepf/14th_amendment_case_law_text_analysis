Appellees, the  owners and operators  of Casa\n\nMarie, and  fourteen of its elderly and  handicapped residents, insti-\n\ntuted the federal action  to enjoin enforcement of the  Superior Court\n\njudgment.  The federal district court ruled that the neighbors' resort\n\nto  the Commonwealth courts to close Casa Marie violated the federally\n\nprotected  rights  of  Casa  Marie residents  under  42  U.S.C.   1983\n\n(\"section  1983\") and the Fair  Housing Act, 42  U.S.C.   3604 (\"Title\n\nVIII\" or \"FHA\").\n\n                                  I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\nA.   The Opening and Expansion of Casa Marie.\nA.   The Opening and Expansion of Casa Marie\n                                            \n\n          The Jardines de Arecibo  housing development was established\n\nin 1967.  Each property in  the development is subject to  restrictive\n\n                                  3\n\ncovenants allowing only detached single-family residences, prohibiting\n\nuses or offensive activities  constituting a \"nuisance,\" and requiring\n\nprior  approval of  all construction  and alterations.   On  April 25,\n\n1986, Casa Marie, a live-in facility for elderly handicapped  persons,\n\nwas  established by  Maria Pla  Placencio  on a  dead-end street  in a\n\nsection of JDA zoned residential (R-3).  The R-3 zoning classification\n\nallows one  and two-family residences, rowhouses,  or apartment build-\n\nings; elder-care facilities are not allowed except as a variance.\n\n          On May 7,  1986, Casa  Marie applied  to  the Department  of\n\nSocial Services (\"DSS\") for a license to operate an elder-care facili-\n\nty in two single-family residences located on adjacent Lots 19 and 20.\n\nThe minimum DSS licensure  requirements included endorsements from the\n\nfire,  police, and  health departments,1 and  a valid  variance permit\n\nfrom the  Administracion de  Reglamentos y Permisos  (\"A.R.P.E.\"), the\n\nagency authorized to  oversee and  administer local zoning  laws.   On\n\nMay 21,  1986, A.R.P.E. granted Casa  Marie a variance  permit, and on\n\nFebruary 4, 1987, Casa Marie was  granted a six-month provisional  DSS\n\nlicense to operate an elder-care  facility on Lots 19 and 20,  pending\n\nfull  compliance  with all  other  licensing requirements.    When its\n\nprovisional DSS license lapsed in August 1987, Casa Marie was denied a\n\npermanent  DSS license due in part  to the discovery that the A.R.P.E.\n\n                    \n\n1As  these endorsements  were not  seriously at  issue, either  in the\nCommonwealth  courts or the federal  court, we do  not address them on\nappeal.\n\n                                  4\n\nvariance permit might be applicable to  Lot 19 only.  DSS nevertheless\n\nallowed Casa Marie to continue to operate under DSS supervision.\n\n          During 1987,  the Casa Marie  owners began to  expand opera-\n\ntions, incorporating a  third single-family residence,  on Lot 21,  by\n\nconstructing wheelchair ramps connecting the  buildings on Lots 19, 20\n\nand 21.2   The  owners did  not seek or  secure the  required A.R.P.E.\n\nconstruction  permits for  these  renovations.   On January 21,  1988,\n\nseveral Casa  Marie neighbors  filed an administrative  complaint with\n\nA.R.P.E.,  pursuant to  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  23,    71x,  72 (1987),3\n\nrequesting that A.R.P.E.  order Casa Marie  to cease all  construction\n\nand  that A.R.P.E. institute judicial  action to compel  Casa Marie to\n\ndemolish the unauthorized structures.\n\nB.   The Superior Court Judgment and Appeal.\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n2By December 1987, the resident population of Casa Marie had increased\nfrom two to twenty-six.\n\n3Section  71x authorizes A.R.P.E. to issue orders to \"cease and desist\nso that necessary preventative  or control measures [can] be  taken to\nachieve the purposes of this chapter . . . .\"  P.R.

The\n\nneighbors  requested  injunctive relief  requiring  demolition  of the\n\ninter-building renovations  and a cessation  of all  operations.   The\n\nA.R.P.E. and Superior  Court actions were consolidated in the Superior\n\nCourt.4\n\n          In  May 1988, in order to remedy its zoning violations, Casa\n\nMarie submitted  a proposal to  A.R.P.E. whereby  Lots 19,  20 and  21\n\nwould be \"grouped\" into one property for zoning purposes.\n\n          On  July 14,  1988,  however,  the  Superior  Court  entered\n\njudgment against Casa Marie, finding, inter alia, that\n                                                \n\n          (1) Casa Marie violated local zoning  laws by its fail-\n          ure to obtain a  valid variance permit for Lot  21, and\n          valid construction permits for the  renovations on Lots\n          19, 20 and 21;\n\n          (2)   Casa  Marie   was  engaged   in  a   \"commercial-\n          institutional\" use, not a \"residential use\" as required\n          by the covenants;\n\n          (3) Increased levels of traffic and noise in the neigh-\n          borhood, and the neighbors'  fears of \"disturbing\"  the\n          elderly  residents, whom they  considered \"strangers in\n          the  neighborhood,\" had  \"creat[ed]  a  dislocation  or\n          disorder  in the  lifestyle  of the  residential  area\"\n          which  constituted a  \"nuisance\" under  the restrictive\n          covenants;\n\n                    \n\n4A.R.P.E.  issued a \"cease and desist\" order on May 31, 1988, prevent-\ning further renovations, but refrained from directing demolition.\n\n                                  6\n\n          (4) Certain businesses located in JDA's R-3 zone    for\n          example,  a medical  office and  a day-care  nursery   \n          also  violated  the  restrictive  covenants,  but those\n          violations  were insufficient  to extinguish  the cove-\n          nants under the equitable  doctrine of \"changed circum-\n          stances\"; and\n\n          (5) Even if A.R.P.E. were to permit a variance for Casa\n          Marie in  the future, thereby excusing  its past zoning\n          violations, A.R.P.E. was without authority under Puerto\n          Rico law to supersede or excuse Casa Marie's coincident\n          violations of the restrictive covenants.\n\nThe  Superior Court  ordered immediate  cessation of  the unauthorized\n\noperations at  Casa Marie, demolition of  the unauthorized renovations\n\nwithin  four months, and notification of the closure of the elder-care\n\nfacility to all Casa Marie residents.\n\n          Upon notification of  the Superior Court judgment,  A.R.P.E.\n\nsuspended action on the  Casa Marie \"lot grouping\" proposal.   Without\n\nan  A.R.P.E. permit,  Casa Marie  was ineligible  for a  permanent DSS\n\noperating license.\n\n          On September 9, 1989,  in their appeal of the Superior Court\n\njudgment to the Supreme  Court of Puerto Rico,  the Casa Marie  owners\n\nalleged, for  the first  time, that  the  neighbors had  discriminated\n\nagainst Casa Marie's handicapped residents under  the Puerto Rico Bill\n\nof Rights  for Aged Persons.   See P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 8,    341-347,\n                                  \n\n343(b) (1987) (\"All aged persons shall  be entitled to . . . live in a\n\ndignified environment that satisfies their basic housing . . . needs\";\n\nauthorizing aged persons to bring a \"priority\" private cause of action\n\n                                  7\n\nin  Commonwealth courts).  The  Supreme Court of  Puerto Rico affirmed\n\nthe Superior Court judgment in November 1989.5\n\n                    \n\n5Casa  Marie filed  a  motion to  set  aside the  judgment,  which the\nSuperior Court denied on March 28, 1990.\n\n                                  8\n\nC.

The neighbors requested a\n\nhearing to compel compliance with the Superior Court judgment.  At the\n\nSuperior  Court  hearing on  August 15,  1990, the  Casa  Marie owners\n\nunsuccessfully attempted to interpose Title VIII claims, presumably in\n\nbehalf  of the residents.  On October 2, 1990, Legal Services Corpora-\n\ntion  (\"Legal Services\") filed a  motion to intervene  in the Superior\n\nCourt enforcement proceedings in behalf  of five Casa Marie  residents\n\n(\"intervenors\").  At the same time, Legal Services brought an indepen-\n\ndent  action  in behalf  of  the intervenors,  asserting  claims under\n\nsection 3604  of the FHA,6  the Puerto  Rico Bill of  Rights for  Aged\n\n                    \n\n6Section 3604(f)(1) of Title VIII makes it unlawful\n\n     [t]o  discriminate in  the sale  or rental, or  to otherwise\n                                                                 \n     make  unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter\n                              \n     because of a handicap of   \n\n          (A)  that buyer or renter,\n          (B)  a  person residing  in or  intending to  reside in\n               that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made\n               available; or\n          (C)  any person associated with that buyer or renter.\n\n42 U.S.C.   3604(f)(1) (emphasis added).\n     Section 3617 further provides that\n\n     [i]t shall  be unlawful to coerce,  intimidate, threaten, or\n     interfere  with any person in  the exercise or enjoyment of,\n     or  on account  of his  having exercised  or enjoyed,  or on\n     account of his having aided  or encouraged any other  person\n     in the exercise or  enjoyment of, any right granted  or pro-\n     tected by [sections 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606].\n\n42 U.S.C.   3617.\n     Plaintiffs appear to have  stated a prima facie case  under Title\n                                                    \nVIII.

Nevertheless, no order was entered disposing of the\n\nmotion to intervene or the newly filed Superior Court lawsuit.\n\nD.   The Federal District Court Action.\n                                      \n\n          Three  days later, on  October 26, a complaint  was filed in\n\nthe federal district court by   Casa Marie, its owners, and nine other\n\nresidents (hereinafter \"nonintervenors\").   The complaint alleged that\n\nthe  neighbors and the Superior Court  had acted in concert to enforce\n\nthe  zoning ordinances  and the  JDA restrictive  covenants in  a dis-\n\ncriminatory manner    in  violation of the Equal Protection  Clause of\n\nthe United States Constitution, and Title VIII    in order  to deprive\n\nthe elderly handicapped residents of their  right to live in an  inte-\n\ngrated community.  The  complaint requested injunctive relief, compen-\n\nsatory and punitive damages, and attorney fees.\n\n          The  district  court allowed  Legal  Services  and the  five\n\nwould-be Superior Court intervenors to intervene  in the federal court\n\naction.   After a four-day hearing, the district court determined that\n\n                                  11\n\nthe neighbors had violated  section 1983 and FHA sections  3604(f) and\n\n3617 by resorting  to the courts  of the Commonwealth  to enforce  the\n\nrelevant zoning  ordinances and  restrictive covenants  as a  means of\n\neffecting a  discriminatory eviction  of the elderly  handicapped Casa\n\nMarie residents from  the neighborhood.   See Casa  Marie v.  Superior\n                                                                      \n\nCourt of Puerto Rico for District of Arecibo, 752 F. Supp. 1152, 1167-\n                                            \n\n69  (D.P.R. 1990).  The district court permanently enjoined the neigh-\n\nbors  from executing their  Superior Court  judgment and  the Superior\n\nCourt contempt decree.  The neighbors and the Superior Court appealed.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\n          The neighbors  advance three contentions on  appeal:  first,\n\nthe  district court  improperly  rejected their  affirmative  defenses\n\nbased  on res judicata, collateral estoppel and the statute of limita-\n\ntions;  second, appellees failed to  sustain their burden  of proof on\n\nthe section 1983  and Title  VIII claims; and  third, under the  Anti-\n\nInjunction Act and the Younger abstention doctrine, the district court\n                              \n\nimproperly enjoined  the pending  Superior Court enforcement  and con-\n\ntempt proceedings.  We need not  confront the entire panoply of appel-\n\nlants' arguments, however, as we  conclude that (1) appellees' section\n\n1983  claims  should have  been dismissed,  and  (2) their  Title VIII\n\nclaims  should not have been  entertained by the  district court since\n\nthe  pending Superior  Court  proceedings would  afford plaintiffs  an\n\nadequate forum.\n\n                                  12\n\n                                  13\n\nA.   The Section 1983 Claims.\n                            \n\n          The neighbors contend on appeal that the residents failed to\n\nestablish an  essential element of  their section 1983  claims; namely\n\nthat the neighbors  acted \"under color of  state law\" by resorting  to\n\nthe Commonwealth  courts to enforce the  restrictive covenants against\n\nCasa Marie.   Relying on  Shelley v. Kraemer,  334 U.S. 1  (1948), the\n                                            \n\ndistrict court  concluded that  the neighbors'  resort to the  Common-\n\nwealth  judicial system to enforce the JDA  restrictive covenants in a\n\ndiscriminatory manner met the \"state action\" requirement under section\n\n1983.  Casa Marie, 752 F. Supp. at 1166.\n                 \n\n          There are two components to the \"state action\" requirement:\n\n          First, the deprivation must be caused by the exer-\n          cise  of some  right or  privilege created  by the\n          State or by a rule of conduct imposed by the State\n          or by a person for whom the State is responsible .\n          . . .  Second, the party charged with the depriva-\n          tion must be a person who may fairly be said to be\n          a state actor.  This may be  because he is a state\n          official, because he  has acted  together with  or\n          has obtained significant aid from state officials,\n          or because his conduct is otherwise  chargeable to\n          the State.\n\nLugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982); United States v.\n                                                                   \n\nPrice, 383  U.S. 787, 794  (1966) (\"Private  persons, jointly  engaged\n     \n\nwith  state  officials in  the  prohibited action,  are  acting 'under\n\ncolor' of law for purposes of [section 1983].  To act 'under color' of\n\nlaw  does not require that the accused be an officer of the State.  It\n\nis enough that he is a willful participant in joint  activity with the\n\nState  or its agents.\").   It is obvious,  nonetheless, that something\n\n                                  14\n\nmore than  mere resort to a  state court is required  to transform the\n\nmoving party into \"a co-conspirator or a joint actor with  the judge.\"\n\nDennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 28 (1980); see also Lugar, 457 U.S.  at\n                                                        \n\n937;  McDougald v.

Appellees  advance two  grounds  for\n      \n\nfinding the requisite \"state action\" in the present case.7\n\n     1.  Corruption, Conspiracy, Usurpation, or Collusion.\n                                                         \n\n          An  actual  conspiracy between  a  state court  and  a party\n\nattempting a  plainly prohibited act would  constitute \"state action.\"\n\nCf. Adickes  v. S.H. Kress  &amp; Co., 398  U.S. 144, 150-52 (1970).   The\n                                 \n\nresidents contend  that the Superior Court  judge improperly abandoned\n\nhis  judicial  role by  permitting the  neighbors  to draft  the final\n\njudgment  against  Casa  Marie, contrary  to  the  normal  practice in\n\nCommonwealth courts.   The neighbors  counter that  they merely  tran-\n                                                                      \n\nscribed the  court's ore tenus ruling at its request.  As the district\n                              \n\ncourt  made no findings of  fact on the  residents' conspiracy allega-\n\ntion, and no uncontroverted record evidence supports it, we decline to\n\ncredit their conclusory  allegation as a sufficient  basis for finding\n\n\"state action\" in these  circumstances.  See, e.g., Schucker  v. Rock-\n                                                                      \n\n                    \n\n7The  \"state action\"  requirement may  be met  where (1)  a sufficient\nfinancial or regulatory nexus exists between the private party and the\nstate  entity; (2) the private  party has been  delegated authority to\nconduct a public function  traditionally within the exclusive preroga-\ntive of the State; or (3) the private party and the state entity share\na  symbiotic, interdependent  relationship.   See Rodriguez-Garcia  v.\n                                                                  \nDavila, 904 F.2d 90, 96-99 (1st Cir. 1990).  These grounds are neither\n      \nsuggested nor established in the present record.\n\n                                  15\n\nwood,  846  F.2d  1202, 1205  (9th  Cir.)

In  Shelley, the  Supreme Court  found \"state\n                                    \n\naction\"  where private parties resorted to the state courts to enforce\n\na facially  discriminatory restrictive covenant which  provided, inter\n                                                                      \n\nalia, that  \"no part of said property . . . shall be, for said term of\n    \n\nFifty-years,  occupied by  any person  not of  the Caucasian  race, it\n\nbeing  intended  hereby to  restrict the  use  of said  property . . .\n\nagainst  the occupancy  as owners  or tenants  of any portion  of said\n\nproperty for resident  or another purpose  by people  of the Negro  or\n\nMongolian  Race.\"  Id. at 4.

See Lavoie v. Bigwood,  457 F.2d 7, 11-12  (1st Cir. 1972).\n                                \n\nDistinguishing Shelley from Griffin v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 130  (1964),\n                                               \n\nJudge Coffin aptly noted:\n\n          In [Griffin,] a deputy sheriff had ordered certain\n                     \n          black patrons to leave a privately-owned amusement\n\n                                  16\n\n          park, had  arrested them  when they refused  to do\n          so,  and  had brought  a prosecution  for criminal\n          trespass.  The Court recounted Maryland's argument\n          that it\n\n               may . . . constitutionally enforce an owner's\n               desire to exclude particular persons from his\n               premises even  if the  owner's  desire is  in\n               turn motivated by  a discriminatory  purpose.\n               The State, it is  said, is not really enforc-\n               ing a policy of segregation since the owner's\n               ultimate purpose is immaterial to  the State.\n               . . .\n\n               The  Court responded  that such were  not the\n          facts of  the case before it, in  that \"The presi-\n          dent of  the corporation  which owned and  managed\n          the park  testified  that he  had instructed  [the\n          deputy sheriff]  to enforce  the park's  policy of\n          racial segregation.\"  A  state, then, must be more\n          strictly neutral  than to permit any  of its offi-\n          cers to identify  the subjects of  the discrimina-\n          tion in the  first instance.  Although  it was not\n          cited in Griffin, we take Shelley to be an earlier\n                                           \n          application of the same principle.  To enforce the\n          covenant and thereby disrupt a transaction between\n          a willing  seller and  a willing buyer,  the state\n          court had  necessarily to  take evidence  that the\n          prospective buyer  was black  and  to take  notice\n          that  the  clause being  enforced  was  a racially\n          restrictive one.\n\n               But while, on the  facts of Shelley and Grif-\n                                                            \n          fin, the Court had no occasion to announce a  nar-\n             \n          rower theory indicating when  a state police offi-\n          cer or court is \"neutral\"  for the purposes of the\n          Fourteenth  Amendment, we  think that,  apart from\n          cases involving  racial discrimination, Maryland's\n          argument suggests  a workable theory.

The zoning ordinances and the restric-\n      \n\ntive  covenants are  facially neutral,  and presumptively  valid under\n\nPuerto  Rico  law.   Furthermore, the  Casa  Marie residents  were not\n\nparties to the Superior Court  action prior to the entry of  the final\n\njudgment.  Thus, it cannot be determined on any evidentiary basis that\n\nthe Superior Court was either apprised of any discriminatory animus on\n\nthe part of  the neighbors,  or asked to  consider any  discriminatory\n\neffect that  the belatedly alleged selective enforcement of the zoning\n\nordinances and restrictive covenants  might occasion.

Without more, the vesting of concurrent juris-\n\ndiction would seem to imply a  vote of confidence in the integrity and\n\ncompetence  of state courts to adjudicate Title VIII claims.

Their argument  distends  the  Act's restrictive  language\n\n(\"expressly  authorized by  Act of  Congress\") to  absurd limits.   If\n           \n\nMitchum's  second  prong  were  to be  considered  satisfied  whenever\n       \n\nCongress enacted  a statute authorizing  injunctive relief, or  by the\n\nmere  fact that  a local  government might  be made  a defendant  in a\n                                          \n\nparticular case, the rule requiring  narrow construction of the  Act's\n\nexceptions would  be rendered  largely meaningless,  and  with it  the\n\ngeneral presumption that state courts are competent to protect federal\n                                     \n\nrights.   See Vendo Co. v.

As a party to the\n\nenforcement-contempt proceedings  yet pending  in the Superior  Court,\n\nCasa Marie not only had ample opportunity, but an obligation, to raise\n\nits federal counterclaims in the Superior  Court.  See P.R.

Apart  from their\n\nunsubstantiated and conclusory allegation  that a Superior Court judge\n\nstated  \"off the  record\" that  she might  be disinclined  to restrain\n                        \n\nenforcement of a final judgment entered by a Superior Court colleague,\n\nthe intervenors neither  alleged nor presented any  evidence (e.g., an\n                                                                  \n\norder denying their motion to intervene or dismissing their complaint)\n\nthat they were  precluded from pursuing either  pending Superior Court\n\naction.  Instead, so  far as the present record indicates,  the inter-\n\nvenors simply suspended their pursuit of the Title VIII claims in  the\n\npending Superior Court proceedings  in favor of a  fresh start in  the\n\nfederal  court action  aimed  at enjoining  enforcement  of the  final\n\nSuperior Court judgment against Casa Marie.\n\n          We conclude that extraordinary injunctive  relief indirectly\n\nsuspending enforcement of the Commonwealth's judicial processes in the\n\nongoing Superior Court proceedings, with its attendant depreciation of\n\nthe  fundamental principles  underlying  federalism  and  comity,  was\n\nunwarranted.  See Moore v.

Juidice, 430  U.S.  at 337.    Thus,\n                                         \n\nYounger abstention  precluded  the  district  court  order  indirectly\n       \n\nenjoining the pending Superior Court contempt proceedings against Casa\n\nMarie and the intervenors.\n\n     2.   The Nonintervenors.\n                            \n\n          The prudential considerations underlying the Anti-Injunction\n\nAct  and  Younger  abstention  require further  searching  inquiry  in\n                 \n\nreference  to the federal claims presented by the nonintervenors.  The\n\nmajority of  cases  in which  federal  courts abstain  from  enjoining\n\npending  state court  proceedings involve  federal plaintiffs  who are\n\nactual  parties to  the state court  proceedings.   The nonintervenors\n\nwere not involved in either pending Superior Court proceeding.   As we\n\nhave noted,  however,  see  supra  Section II.B.1.a.,  the  state  and\n                                 \n\nfederal courts  possess concurrent jurisdiction under  Title VIII, see\n                                                                      \n\n42 U.S.C.   3613(a) (1)(A), offering Title VIII plaintiffs a choice of\n\nforum.  Ultimately, therefore,  the essential question becomes whether\n\nthe  nonintervenors waived or  acquiesced in a waiver  of the right to\n\npresent their Title VIII claims in the federal forum.\n\n                                  27\n\n          a.

Yet  nonintervenors'\n\nfederal  complaint is distinctive  in two significant  respects    one\n\nsubstantive and one procedural.   The nonintervenors' complaint hinges\n\nentirely  on  their proving  that the  neighbors harbored  the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory intent to exclude the residents as a group from the JDA\n                                                         \n\nhousing  development;  in no  sense does  it  focus on  any particular\n                                                                      \n\nresident as an individual target of the alleged discrimination.

Moreover,\n\nwithholding the  \"strangers\" exclusion  under the Anti-Injunction  Act\n\nhas less drastic repercussions for the federal plaintiffs than would a\n\nformal res judicata determination.

More importantly,  of course,  where  the case  for \"virtual\n\nrepresentation\" is so compelling, and  the effects of the  \"strangers\"\n\nexclusion  so obtrusive,  the exercise  of a federal  court's narrowly\n\nconfined  power to  enjoin a  pending state  court proceeding  must be\n\nconsidered at its most suspect extension.16\n\n          b.

See,  e.g., New  Jersey-Philadelphia Presbytery  of Bible\n                                                                      \n\nPresbyterian Church v.

For  example,  while section  1983  claims come  within  an\n\"express\" exception to the Anti-Injunction  Act, such claims may still\nbe subject to Younger abstention.  See Younger, 401 U.S. at 54.\n                                              \n\n18For example,  Doran involved  a federal plaintiff's  challenge to  a\n                     \nstate statute which was the subject of an ongoing criminal prosecution\n                                                          \nagainst  co-plaintiffs.   Of  course,  nondefendants  are barred  from\nintervention in a criminal proceeding.  While the federal plaintiff in\nDoran did not directly  seek to enjoin the state  criminal proceeding,\n     \ninterim  federal relief would have had the effect of (1) \"interfering\"\nwith the  state prosecution and (2)  depriving the state court  of its\nability to decide the merits of the federal defenses.

Even so, once again they\n\ndelayed, while  the neighbors obtained a contempt  decree against Casa\n\nMarie.  By  delaying until so late in  the litigation, intervenors and\n\nnonintervenors withheld  defenses the  presentation of which  may well\n\nhave  aided the  Superior Court  in its  evaluation of  the neighbors'\n\nstate-law claims and its  determination of a measured remedy  for Casa\n\nMarie's zoning law violations.

Furthermore,  absent unambiguous  evidence that  the state\n\ncourt rendered  its final  judgment in a  discriminatory or  otherwise\n\nimpermissible manner, see  supra Section  II.A., prudential  consider-\n                                \n\nations normally  will warrant  federal  court deference  to the  state\n                                                                      \n\ncourt's assessment  of any competing interests  belatedly presented to\n                  \n\nthe federal court which  might warrant relief from the  enforcement of\n\nthe state court judgment.\n\n          We  mention a relevant example.  Title VIII does not require\n\na showing that discriminatory intent was the sole factor, but rather a\n\nsubstantial factor motivating defendants'  conduct.  See, e.g., United\n                                                                      \n\nStates v.

First, plaintiff has the threshold burden\nto show a discriminatory effect or impact    that the housing practice\n\"actually or  predictably results  in discrimination as  defined under\n\n                                  39\n\nVIII absent a sufficient causal link between the defendants' discrimi-\n\nnatory  actions and  the threatened  injury to  the plaintiffs.

Third, once the plaintiff has established a prima\n                                                                      \nfacie case of discriminatory  effect, the burden shifts to  the defen-\n     \ndant to advance some  legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for  his\nactions.  See,  e.g., Asbury v.  Brougham, 866 F.2d  1276, 1279  (10th\n                                         \nCir.  1989); Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 933; Robinson, 610 F.2d at\n                                                         \n1039.  And fourth, the factfinder must weigh the evidence of discrimi-\nnatory effect or  intent against the proffered justifications  for the\ndefendant's actions.    In  this balancing  process,  the  court  must\nconsider  the type  of relief  sought by  plaintiff.   Where plaintiff\n                  \nseeks  a judgment which  would require  defendant to  take affirmative\naction  to correct  a  Title VIII  violation,  plaintiff must  make  a\ngreater  showing  of discriminatory  effect.   On  the other  hand, if\nplaintiff  seeks a  judgment merely  enjoining defendant  from further\ninterference with the  exercise of  plaintiff's Title  VIII rights,  a\nlesser showing of discriminatory effect would suffice.  See Metropoli-\n                                                                      \ntan Hous. Dev. Corp.  v.

Laws  Ann. tit. 23,   71x,  72 (1987), a  private\n\ncitizen  apparently need only show that the defendant has violated the\n\nzoning  laws.  See  supra note 3.   In contrast,  the district court's\n                         \n\nconsideration of the federal plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief\n\nimmersed the court in speculation as to whether the Superior Court, in\n\nassessing  the threat  posed  by Casa  Marie's continued  operation,22\n\n                    \n\n21Although  the Superior Court noted  that Casa Marie  would remain in\nviolation of  the JDA  restrictive  covenants even  if A.R.P.E.  later\nexcused Casa Marie's noncompliance with the zoning ordinances, nothing\nin  its opinion intimates that  the zoning violations  were not deemed\nindependent  grounds  for the  closure.   Appellees contended  at oral\n           \nargument that they had cured their zoning violations subsequent to the\nentry  of the  district court's  permanent injunction.   In  our view,\nhowever,  the  district court  impermissibly  involved  itself in  the\nspeculative inquiry whether  Casa Marie would (or  could) bring itself\ninto compliance with the zoning ordinances after entry of the Superior\nCourt  judgment.    Once  again,  prudential  considerations militated\nstrongly in  favor  of deferring  to the  Superior Court  as the  more\nappropriate  forum  in which  to  present  evidence and  consider  any\n                                                   \nunadjudicated claims for injunctive relief from the enforcement of the\nfinal Superior Court judgment.\n\n22The Superior Court  is in  the optimal position  to adjudge  whether\ncompliance with the zoning ordinances should be \"waived.\"  Discrimina-\ntion against handicapped persons  is specifically defined for purposes\nof section 3604(f) as (a) \"a refusal to  permit, at the expense of the\nhandicapped  person,  reasonable  modifications of  existing  premises\n                                               \noccupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be\nnecessary to afford such  person full enjoyment of the  premises,\" and\n(2)  \"a refusal to make reasonable  accommodations in rules, policies,\n                                                                     \npractices, or services,  when such accommodations may be  necessary to\n                      \nafford  such person  equal  opportunity  to  use  and  enjoy  a  dwel-\n\n                                  41\n\nwould compel closure irrespective of any  discriminatory intent on the\n                                 \n\npart of the neighbors.23\n\n          We  do not lightly conclude that there was an implied waiver\n\nof nonintervenors'  statutory right to assert their  Title VIII claims\n\nin  a federal forum.   Nevertheless, their  delay in resorting  to the\n\nfederal forum  until  the  Superior  Court contempt  decree  had  been\n\nentered cannot be  countenanced without encouraging  the very sort  of\n\negregious intrusion upon state judicial power which Younger abstention\n                                                           \n\nwas designed to avert.

It\n        \nmight ultimately  determine that  Casa Marie's noncompliance  with the\nzoning laws requires closure, but that  the neighbors nevertheless are\nliable  in  damages to  Casa Marie's  residents  for resorting  to the\nzoning laws and the restrictive covenants for discriminatory purposes.\nWe believe these matters are suitably left to the Commonwealth courts.\n\n                                  42\n\ned  an  adequate  \"opportunity\"  to participate  in  the  Commonwealth\n\nproceedings, however, we anticipate that the Superior Court, as it has\n\nto date    out of respect  for the principles of comity and federalism\n\n   will defer further enforcement of its judgment and contempt decree,\n\nfor  such reasonable time  as it may  allow, to permit  the filing and\n\nconsideration  of the residents' motions to  intervene in the enforce-\n\nment  proceeding,  or in  the  alternative, to  permit  intervenors to\n\nprosecute their independent action.\n\n          The district court judgment is vacated.

Appellees, the  owners and operators  of Casa\n\nMarie, and  fourteen of its elderly and  handicapped residents, insti-\n\ntuted the federal action  to enjoin enforcement of the  Superior Court\n\njudgment.  The federal district court ruled that the neighbors' resort\n\nto  the Commonwealth courts to close Casa Marie violated the federally\n\nprotected  rights  of  Casa  Marie residents  under  42  U.S.C.   1983\n\n(\"section  1983\") and the Fair  Housing Act, 42  U.S.C.   3604 (\"Title\n\nVIII\" or \"FHA\").\n\n                                  I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n                                        \n\nA.   The Opening and Expansion of Casa Marie.\nA.   The Opening and Expansion of Casa Marie\n                                            \n\n          The Jardines de Arecibo  housing development was established\n\nin 1967.  Each property in  the development is subject to  restrictive\n\n                                  3\n\ncovenants allowing only detached single-family residences, prohibiting\n\nuses or offensive activities  constituting a \"nuisance,\" and requiring\n\nprior  approval of  all construction  and alterations.   On  April 25,\n\n1986, Casa Marie, a live-in facility for elderly handicapped  persons,\n\nwas  established by  Maria Pla  Placencio  on a  dead-end street  in a\n\nsection of JDA zoned residential (R-3).  The R-3 zoning classification\n\nallows one  and two-family residences, rowhouses,  or apartment build-\n\nings; elder-care facilities are not allowed except as a variance.\n\n          On May 7,  1986, Casa  Marie applied  to  the Department  of\n\nSocial Services (\"DSS\") for a license to operate an elder-care facili-\n\nty in two single-family residences located on adjacent Lots 19 and 20.\n\nThe minimum DSS licensure  requirements included endorsements from the\n\nfire,  police, and  health departments,1 and  a valid  variance permit\n\nfrom the  Administracion de  Reglamentos y Permisos  (\"A.R.P.E.\"), the\n\nagency authorized to  oversee and  administer local zoning  laws.   On\n\nMay 21,  1986, A.R.P.E. granted Casa  Marie a variance  permit, and on\n\nFebruary 4, 1987, Casa Marie was  granted a six-month provisional  DSS\n\nlicense to operate an elder-care  facility on Lots 19 and 20,  pending\n\nfull  compliance  with all  other  licensing requirements.    When its\n\nprovisional DSS license lapsed in August 1987, Casa Marie was denied a\n\npermanent  DSS license due in part  to the discovery that the A.R.P.E.\n\n                    \n\n1As  these endorsements  were not  seriously at  issue, either  in the\nCommonwealth  courts or the federal  court, we do  not address them on\nappeal.\n\n                                  4\n\nvariance permit might be applicable to  Lot 19 only.  DSS nevertheless\n\nallowed Casa Marie to continue to operate under DSS supervision.\n\n          During 1987,  the Casa Marie  owners began to  expand opera-\n\ntions, incorporating a  third single-family residence,  on Lot 21,  by\n\nconstructing wheelchair ramps connecting the  buildings on Lots 19, 20\n\nand 21.2   The  owners did  not seek or  secure the  required A.R.P.E.\n\nconstruction  permits for  these  renovations.   On January 21,  1988,\n\nseveral Casa  Marie neighbors  filed an administrative  complaint with\n\nA.R.P.E.,  pursuant to  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  23,    71x,  72 (1987),3\n\nrequesting that A.R.P.E.  order Casa Marie  to cease all  construction\n\nand  that A.R.P.E. institute judicial  action to compel  Casa Marie to\n\ndemolish the unauthorized structures.\n\nB.   The Superior Court Judgment and Appeal.\n                                           \n\n                    \n\n2By December 1987, the resident population of Casa Marie had increased\nfrom two to twenty-six.\n\n3Section  71x authorizes A.R.P.E. to issue orders to \"cease and desist\nso that necessary preventative  or control measures [can] be  taken to\nachieve the purposes of this chapter . . . .\"  P.R.

The\n\nneighbors  requested  injunctive relief  requiring  demolition  of the\n\ninter-building renovations  and a cessation  of all  operations.   The\n\nA.R.P.E. and Superior  Court actions were consolidated in the Superior\n\nCourt.4\n\n          In  May 1988, in order to remedy its zoning violations, Casa\n\nMarie submitted  a proposal to  A.R.P.E. whereby  Lots 19,  20 and  21\n\nwould be \"grouped\" into one property for zoning purposes.\n\n          On  July 14,  1988,  however,  the  Superior  Court  entered\n\njudgment against Casa Marie, finding, inter alia, that\n                                                \n\n          (1) Casa Marie violated local zoning  laws by its fail-\n          ure to obtain a  valid variance permit for Lot  21, and\n          valid construction permits for the  renovations on Lots\n          19, 20 and 21;\n\n          (2)   Casa  Marie   was  engaged   in  a   \"commercial-\n          institutional\" use, not a \"residential use\" as required\n          by the covenants;\n\n          (3) Increased levels of traffic and noise in the neigh-\n          borhood, and the neighbors'  fears of \"disturbing\"  the\n          elderly  residents, whom they  considered \"strangers in\n          the  neighborhood,\" had  \"creat[ed]  a  dislocation  or\n          disorder  in the  lifestyle  of the  residential  area\"\n          which  constituted a  \"nuisance\" under  the restrictive\n          covenants;\n\n                    \n\n4A.R.P.E.  issued a \"cease and desist\" order on May 31, 1988, prevent-\ning further renovations, but refrained from directing demolition.\n\n                                  6\n\n          (4) Certain businesses located in JDA's R-3 zone    for\n          example,  a medical  office and  a day-care  nursery   \n          also  violated  the  restrictive  covenants,  but those\n          violations  were insufficient  to extinguish  the cove-\n          nants under the equitable  doctrine of \"changed circum-\n          stances\"; and\n\n          (5) Even if A.R.P.E. were to permit a variance for Casa\n          Marie in  the future, thereby excusing  its past zoning\n          violations, A.R.P.E. was without authority under Puerto\n          Rico law to supersede or excuse Casa Marie's coincident\n          violations of the restrictive covenants.\n\nThe  Superior Court  ordered immediate  cessation of  the unauthorized\n\noperations at  Casa Marie, demolition of  the unauthorized renovations\n\nwithin  four months, and notification of the closure of the elder-care\n\nfacility to all Casa Marie residents.\n\n          Upon notification of  the Superior Court judgment,  A.R.P.E.\n\nsuspended action on the  Casa Marie \"lot grouping\" proposal.   Without\n\nan  A.R.P.E. permit,  Casa Marie  was ineligible  for a  permanent DSS\n\noperating license.\n\n          On September 9, 1989,  in their appeal of the Superior Court\n\njudgment to the Supreme  Court of Puerto Rico,  the Casa Marie  owners\n\nalleged, for  the first  time, that  the  neighbors had  discriminated\n\nagainst Casa Marie's handicapped residents under  the Puerto Rico Bill\n\nof Rights  for Aged Persons.   See P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 8,    341-347,\n                                  \n\n343(b) (1987) (\"All aged persons shall  be entitled to . . . live in a\n\ndignified environment that satisfies their basic housing . . . needs\";\n\nauthorizing aged persons to bring a \"priority\" private cause of action\n\n                                  7\n\nin  Commonwealth courts).  The  Supreme Court of  Puerto Rico affirmed\n\nthe Superior Court judgment in November 1989.5\n\n                    \n\n5Casa  Marie filed  a  motion to  set  aside the  judgment,  which the\nSuperior Court denied on March 28, 1990.\n\n                                  8\n\nC.   The Enforcement and Contempt Proceedings.\n                                             \n\n          Casa  Marie continued to operate.  The neighbors requested a\n\nhearing to compel compliance with the Superior Court judgment.  At the\n\nSuperior  Court  hearing on  August 15,  1990, the  Casa  Marie owners\n\nunsuccessfully attempted to interpose Title VIII claims, presumably in\n\nbehalf  of the residents.  On October 2, 1990, Legal Services Corpora-\n\ntion  (\"Legal Services\") filed a  motion to intervene  in the Superior\n\nCourt enforcement proceedings in behalf  of five Casa Marie  residents\n\n(\"intervenors\").  At the same time, Legal Services brought an indepen-\n\ndent  action  in behalf  of  the intervenors,  asserting  claims under\n\nsection 3604  of the FHA,6  the Puerto  Rico Bill of  Rights for  Aged\n\n                    \n\n6Section 3604(f)(1) of Title VIII makes it unlawful\n\n     [t]o  discriminate in  the sale  or rental, or  to otherwise\n                                                                 \n     make  unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter\n                              \n     because of a handicap of   \n\n          (A)  that buyer or renter,\n          (B)  a  person residing  in or  intending to  reside in\n               that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made\n               available; or\n          (C)  any person associated with that buyer or renter.\n\n42 U.S.C.   3604(f)(1) (emphasis added).\n     Section 3617 further provides that\n\n     [i]t shall  be unlawful to coerce,  intimidate, threaten, or\n     interfere  with any person in  the exercise or enjoyment of,\n     or  on account  of his  having exercised  or enjoyed,  or on\n     account of his having aided  or encouraged any other  person\n     in the exercise or  enjoyment of, any right granted  or pro-\n     tected by [sections 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606].\n\n42 U.S.C.   3617.\n     Plaintiffs appear to have  stated a prima facie case  under Title\n                                                    \nVIII.

The complaint alleged that\n\nthe  neighbors and the Superior Court  had acted in concert to enforce\n\nthe  zoning ordinances  and the  JDA restrictive  covenants in  a dis-\n\ncriminatory manner    in  violation of the Equal Protection  Clause of\n\nthe United States Constitution, and Title VIII    in order  to deprive\n\nthe elderly handicapped residents of their  right to live in an  inte-\n\ngrated community.  The  complaint requested injunctive relief, compen-\n\nsatory and punitive damages, and attorney fees.\n\n          The  district  court allowed  Legal  Services  and the  five\n\nwould-be Superior Court intervenors to intervene  in the federal court\n\naction.   After a four-day hearing, the district court determined that\n\n                                  11\n\nthe neighbors had violated  section 1983 and FHA sections  3604(f) and\n\n3617 by resorting  to the courts  of the Commonwealth  to enforce  the\n\nrelevant zoning  ordinances and  restrictive covenants  as a  means of\n\neffecting a  discriminatory eviction  of the elderly  handicapped Casa\n\nMarie residents from  the neighborhood.

The zoning ordinances and the restric-\n      \n\ntive  covenants are  facially neutral,  and presumptively  valid under\n\nPuerto  Rico  law.   Furthermore, the  Casa  Marie residents  were not\n\nparties to the Superior Court  action prior to the entry of  the final\n\njudgment.  Thus, it cannot be determined on any evidentiary basis that\n\nthe Superior Court was either apprised of any discriminatory animus on\n\nthe part of  the neighbors,  or asked to  consider any  discriminatory\n\neffect that  the belatedly alleged selective enforcement of the zoning\n\nordinances and restrictive covenants  might occasion.  Without indulg-\n\ning  conjecture, therefore, it  cannot be concluded  that the Superior\n\nCourt must necessarily have been made privy to any allegedly discrimi-\n\nnatory design on  the part of the neighbors.

As a party to the\n\nenforcement-contempt proceedings  yet pending  in the Superior  Court,\n\nCasa Marie not only had ample opportunity, but an obligation, to raise\n\nits federal counterclaims in the Superior  Court.  See P.R.

Apart  from their\n\nunsubstantiated and conclusory allegation  that a Superior Court judge\n\nstated  \"off the  record\" that  she might  be disinclined  to restrain\n                        \n\nenforcement of a final judgment entered by a Superior Court colleague,\n\nthe intervenors neither  alleged nor presented any  evidence (e.g., an\n                                                                  \n\norder denying their motion to intervene or dismissing their complaint)\n\nthat they were  precluded from pursuing either  pending Superior Court\n\naction.

For  example,  while section  1983  claims come  within  an\n\"express\" exception to the Anti-Injunction  Act, such claims may still\nbe subject to Younger abstention.  See Younger, 401 U.S. at 54.\n                                              \n\n18For example,  Doran involved  a federal plaintiff's  challenge to  a\n                     \nstate statute which was the subject of an ongoing criminal prosecution\n                                                          \nagainst  co-plaintiffs.   Of  course,  nondefendants  are barred  from\nintervention in a criminal proceeding.  While the federal plaintiff in\nDoran did not directly  seek to enjoin the state  criminal proceeding,\n     \ninterim  federal relief would have had the effect of (1) \"interfering\"\nwith the  state prosecution and (2)  depriving the state court  of its\nability to decide the merits of the federal defenses.

And fourth, the factfinder must weigh the evidence of discrimi-\nnatory effect or  intent against the proffered justifications  for the\ndefendant's actions.

Laws  Ann. tit. 23,   71x,  72 (1987), a  private\n\ncitizen  apparently need only show that the defendant has violated the\n\nzoning  laws.  See  supra note 3.   In contrast,  the district court's\n                         \n\nconsideration of the federal plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief\n\nimmersed the court in speculation as to whether the Superior Court, in\n\nassessing  the threat  posed  by Casa  Marie's continued  operation,22\n\n                    \n\n21Although  the Superior Court noted  that Casa Marie  would remain in\nviolation of  the JDA  restrictive  covenants even  if A.R.P.E.  later\nexcused Casa Marie's noncompliance with the zoning ordinances, nothing\nin  its opinion intimates that  the zoning violations  were not deemed\nindependent  grounds  for the  closure.   Appellees contended  at oral\n           \nargument that they had cured their zoning violations subsequent to the\nentry  of the  district court's  permanent injunction.   In  our view,\nhowever,  the  district court  impermissibly  involved  itself in  the\nspeculative inquiry whether  Casa Marie would (or  could) bring itself\ninto compliance with the zoning ordinances after entry of the Superior\nCourt  judgment.    Once  again,  prudential  considerations militated\nstrongly in  favor  of deferring  to the  Superior Court  as the  more\nappropriate  forum  in which  to  present  evidence and  consider  any\n                                                   \nunadjudicated claims for injunctive relief from the enforcement of the\nfinal Superior Court judgment.\n\n22The Superior Court  is in  the optimal position  to adjudge  whether\ncompliance with the zoning ordinances should be \"waived.\"  Discrimina-\ntion against handicapped persons  is specifically defined for purposes\nof section 3604(f) as (a) \"a refusal to  permit, at the expense of the\nhandicapped  person,  reasonable  modifications of  existing  premises\n                                               \noccupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be\nnecessary to afford such  person full enjoyment of the  premises,\" and\n(2)  \"a refusal to make reasonable  accommodations in rules, policies,\n                                                                     \npractices, or services,  when such accommodations may be  necessary to\n                      \nafford  such person  equal  opportunity  to  use  and  enjoy  a  dwel-\n\n                                  41\n\nwould compel closure irrespective of any  discriminatory intent on the\n                                 \n\npart of the neighbors.23\n\n          We  do not lightly conclude that there was an implied waiver\n\nof nonintervenors'  statutory right to assert their  Title VIII claims\n\nin  a federal forum.   Nevertheless, their  delay in resorting  to the\n\nfederal forum  until  the  Superior  Court contempt  decree  had  been\n\nentered cannot be  countenanced without encouraging  the very sort  of\n\negregious intrusion upon state judicial power which Younger abstention\n                                                           \n\nwas designed to avert.

It\n        \nmight ultimately  determine that  Casa Marie's noncompliance  with the\nzoning laws requires closure, but that  the neighbors nevertheless are\nliable  in  damages to  Casa Marie's  residents  for resorting  to the\nzoning laws and the restrictive covenants for discriminatory purposes.\nWe believe these matters are suitably left to the Commonwealth courts.\n\n                                  42\n\ned  an  adequate  \"opportunity\"  to participate  in  the  Commonwealth\n\nproceedings, however, we anticipate that the Superior Court, as it has\n\nto date    out of respect  for the principles of comity and federalism\n\n   will defer further enforcement of its judgment and contempt decree,\n\nfor  such reasonable time  as it may  allow, to permit  the filing and\n\nconsideration  of the residents' motions to  intervene in the enforce-\n\nment  proceeding,  or in  the  alternative, to  permit  intervenors to\n\nprosecute their independent action.\n\n          The district court judgment is vacated.
