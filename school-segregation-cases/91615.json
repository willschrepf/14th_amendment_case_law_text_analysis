SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n\n     The Attorney General of Louisiana appeals a judgment striking\n\fa state constitutional amendment and invalidating implementing\n\nlegislation designed to divide the Rapides Parish School District\n\ninto two districts.             Finding this case not ripe for review, we\n\nvacate and remand.\n\n\n\n                                           I.\n\n                                           A.\n\n        The      Rapides    Parish    School     Board    (“RPSB”)    operated     a\n\nconstitutionally impermissible dual school systemSSone for whites\n\nand one for non-whitesSSat the time of Brown v. Board of Educ.,\n\n347 U.S.         483   (1954)   (Brown   I).     In   light   of   Brown   and   its\n\nprogenySSwhich directed that schools be desegregated “with all\n\ndeliberate speed,” Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 301\n\n(1955) (Brown II)SSblack children in 1965 filed suit against the\n\nRPSB, seeking desegregation.\n\n        In the intervening thirty-three years, the district court has\n\nimposed successive plans to achieve integration.                   None apparently\n\nhas achieved unitary status or has brought the district court to\n\nthe point of relinquishing its remedial powers over the RPSB.1\n\n        At first, the district court settled upon a “free choice” plan\n\nthat removed the barriers for blacks to go to white schools and\n\nvice versa, but stopped short of forced integration.                       When the\n\n\n\n        1\n            The district court recently extended its order through the 2005-06 school\nyear.\n\n                                            2\n\fSupreme Court struck down a similar program in Green v. County\n\nSch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430 (1968), this court directed the district\n\ncourt to be more aggressive in achieving integration, using the\n\nGreen factors.   That was in 1969.       See generally Valley v. Rapides\n\nParish Sch. Bd. (“Valley I”), 646 F.2d 925, 929-30 (describing the\n\nhistory of the litigation), modified, 653 F.2d 941 (5th Cir. Unit A\n\nMay 1981).\n\n     Since    that   time,   the   district   court   has   given   careful\n\nattention to the racial ratios of the students, faculty, and\n\nadministrators in each school.       The program continues to this day\n\nand involves extensive busing and other means to achieve racial\n\nparity.    The district court remains active in redrawing the lines\n\nof attendance at schoolsSSat regular intervalsSSin order to maintain\n\nracial balance and in managing other aspects of running the RPSB.\n\n     At issue in this case are Wards 9, 10, and 11 of Rapides\n\nParish (the “northern wards”), all north of the Red River.            These\n\nwards are primarily white, while the remaining wardsSSlocated in\n\nthe city of Alexandria, south of the riverSSare more racially\n\nmixed.    The northern wards areSSand have beenSSpart of the RPSB.\n\n     Throughout the litigation, the district court has made a\n\ncontinuing effort to maintain racial balance in the city schools of\n\nAlexandria.    Accordingly, the court has ordered the RPSB to bus\n\nwhite students from these suburbs to the city and to do the\n\nopposite with non-white students from the city. The district court\n\n\n                                     3\n\fhas been hindered in its quest for racial balance, however, by\n\nincreases in white flight and in black enrollment.\n\n     In 1995, the state legislature approved a ballot measure to\n\nchange the state constitution to form a separate school district in\n\nthe northern wards and to allow it to elect its own school board.\n\nThe measure was approved by state voters and proclaimed part of the\n\nstate constitution by the governor in November 1995.         See LA. CONST.\n\nart. VIII, § 13(D), and advisory notes.\n\n     Contemporaneously,      the       legislature       passed     enabling\n\nlegislationSSAct   973SSto   provide,    among   other    things,   for   the\n\ndrawing of election districts for the members of the new district’s\n\nboard.   See LA. REV. STAT. ANN. § 17:62.            Assuming the Justice\n\nDepartment’s approval of the voting districts under the Voting\n\nRights Act, the election for the initial board members is to take\n\nplace with the congressional elections in November 1998.             See id.\n\n§ 17:62(C).\n\n\n\n                                   B.\n\n     The RPSB filed the instant declaratory judgment actionSSas\n\npart of its ongoing school desegregation litigationSSin October\n\n1996, praying for a declaration that Act 973 is unconstitutional as\n\napplied to the RPSB because it interferes with the RPSB's ability\n\nto conform to the desegregation order.           See Valley v. Rapides\n\nParish Sch. Bd., 960 F. Supp. 96, 97 (W.D. La. 1997).                At the\n\n\n                                   4\n\fdistrict court’s request, the RPSB served notice on the state\n\nattorney general, who is the officer statutorily obliged to defend\n\nthe state’s laws.\n\n      The attorney general filed a response opposing the declaratory\n\njudgment but did not have the opportunity to introduce evidence in\n\nsupport of the law.2           Instead, he argued that a declaratory\n\njudgment was improper because the claim is not ripe for review.\n\nEven if it were ripe, he reasoned, the law does not unconstitution-\n\nally infringe on the district court’s remedial authority.\n\n      The district court found that there was a ripe case or\n\ncontroversy    needed    to   sustain    a   declaratory    judgment    action,\n\nbecause the school district faced substantial uncertainty and\n\nexpense   if   subjected      to   the   possibility   of   adhering    to   two\n\nconflicting obligationsSSone imposed by the state constitution and\n\nthe other by the federal court.              See id. at 98.      Reaching the\n\nmerits, the court relied on the fact that without the northern\n\nwards, there would be fewer white children in the remaining school\n\ndistrict. The resulting RPSB would become slightly more black than\n\nwhite, while the new district would be overwhelmingly white.3                The\n\ncourt held that because of this change in racial balance, Act 973\n\nimpermissibly infringes on its remedial powers and thus offends the\n\n\n\n      2\n        The district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing before it entered\nits order.\n      3\n        The students residing in the remaining RPSB would be 60% black and 40%\nwhite, while those residing in the new district would be 87% white and 13% black.\n\n                                         5\n\ffederal Constitution.        See id. at 100-01.\n\n      The state appeals this adverse judgment.               The RPSB, and the\n\nUnited States as plaintiff-intervenor, argue for affirmance.4\n\n\n\n                                       II.\n\n                                        A.\n\n      Ripeness concerns subject matter jurisdiction, so we consider\n\nit de novo.5        Subject-matter jurisdiction can be raised at any\n\ntime, even sua sponte.         See, e.g., Marathon Oil Co. v. Ruhrgas,\n\n1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 13358, at *12 (5th Cir. June 22, 1998)\n\n(en banc).\n\n\n\n                                        B.\n\n      With any declaratory judgment action, there is a concern that\n\nthe legal issues will not be sufficiently developed for the court\n\nto make a decision on the merits.            Instead, the court may face a\n\nset of facts so contingent on other events that a decision would\n\nconstitute no more than an advisory opinion on an abstract legal\n\n\n      4\n        Not participating in the appeal are the original minority plaintiffsSSthe\nparties ostensibly sued by the school district in its declaratory judgment\naction. The real adverse parties appear to be the proposed new school district\nand the state.\n      5\n        See Powder River Basin Resource Council v. Babbitt, 54 F.3d 1477, 1483 (10th\nCir. 1995); Felmeister v. Office of Attorney Ethics, 856 F.2d 529, 535 n.8 (3d Cir.\n1988).       A decision to stay a declaratory judgment proceeding when there is a\nparallel state court proceeding is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Wilton v.\nSeven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 282-83 (1995). We decline to adopt the appellants'\nsuggestion that Wilton addresses the district court’s finding of Article III\nsubject-matter jurisdiction under the ripeness doctrine.\n\n                                         6\n\fdispute.     Accordingly, before addressing the merits of the case,\n\ncourts must be vigilant, in declaratory judgment suits, to make\n\ncertain the action is ripe for review.\n\n\n\n                                        1.\n\n      “Ripeness is a function of an issue’s fitness for judicial\n\nresolution as well as the hardship imposed on the parties by\n\ndelaying court consideration.”6 Thus, in considering a declaratory\n\njudgment    action’s     ripeness     for    review,    we    address    both    a\n\nconstitutional requirement and prudential concerns.                 The Supreme\n\nCourt most recently has reminded us of the importance of these\n\nconsiderations.      See Texas v. United States, 118 S. Ct. 1256, 1259-\n\n60 (1998); accord National Treasury Employees Union v. United\n\nStates, 101 F.3d 1423, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“NTEU”).\n\n\n\n                                        a.\n\n      A    federal   court     must   find    that     Article    III   standing\n\nrequirements are met.           These include (1) “injury in factSSan\n\ninvasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and\n\nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\n\nhypothetical”; (2) causation, meaning that the injury is “fairly\n\ntraceable to the challenged action of the defendant”; and (3)\n\n\n\n      6\n        Jobs, Training & Servs., Inc. v. East Tex. Council of Gov’ts, 50 F.3d 1318,\n1325 (5th Cir. 1995); see, e.g., Abbott Lab. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967).\n\n                                        7\n\fredressability, meaning that “it must be likely, as opposed to\n\nmerely    speculative,    that   the   injury    will   be   redressed    by   a\n\nfavorable decision.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n\n560-61 (1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see\n\nNTEU, 101 F.3d at 1427.             The standing component that deals\n\ndirectly with ripeness is the requirement of “imminence.”                 In a\n\ndeclaratory action, the threatened injury must be “sufficiently\n\n'imminent' to establish standing.”          NTEU, 101 F.3d at 1428.\n\n\n\n                                       b.\n\n      Once the constitutional showing has been made, a court must\n\nsatisfy prudential concerns by balancing the need to expend its\n\nresources on a case it may never need to decide against the expense\n\nand hardship to the parties of having a delayed adjudication.               The\n\ncourt must make sure that a sufficient factual basis, and necessity\n\non the part of the parties, exist to justify the expenditure of\n\njudicial resources. “Prudentially, the ripeness doctrine exists to\n\nprevent the courts from wasting our resources by prematurely\n\nentangling ourselves in abstract disagreements . . . .”                  Id. at\n\n1431.7 These prudential concerns ensure that changing hypothetical\n\ncircumstances or lack of party interest does not make resolution of\n\n\n\n      7\n        See also Ohio Forestry Ass'n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 118 S. Ct. 1665, 1670\n(1998) (“[T]he ripeness requirement is designed 'to prevent the courts, through\navoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract\ndisagreements . . . .'”) (quoting Abbott Lab., 387 U.S. at 148-49).\n\n                                       8\n\fthe legal issues unnecessary.   “Article III courts should not make\n\ndecisions unless they have to.”       Id.\n\n\n\n                                  2.\n\n                                  a.\n\n     This case is not ripe for adjudication, because it fails to\n\nsatisfy the Article III “case or controversy” requirement.      Under\n\nthe Article III analysis, there is no imminent threat of harm to\n\nthe RPSB or to the desegregation decrees.       As the district court\n\nfound, there is a potential threat of harm.            RPSB could be\n\nsubjected to conflicting obligations of the federal court and the\n\nstate constitution. The harm’s probability of occurrence, however,\n\nis sufficiently remoteSSgiven the myriad of contingencies necessary\n\nfor it to developSSthat it fails to constitute the immediate harm\n\nnecessary for Article III justiciability.\n\n     In order for the RPSB to face an imminent risk of violation of\n\nthe desegregation order, too many contingencies would have to\n\noccur.   There would have to be a new district in the northern wards\n\nwith a proposed plan that would unconstitutionally interfere with\n\nthe court’s remedial authority.        For that to occur, there would\n\nhave to be a proposed plan about how the new district would operate\n\nin relation to the RPSB.   For that to occur, there would have to be\n\nan election of a new board.     And for that to occur, there would\n\nhave to be Justice Department preclearance of the new voting\n\n\n                                  9\n\fdistricts.    Because any one of these numerous links may not come to\n\nbe,   the    string    of   contingencies      is    too   tenuous    to    support\n\nripeness.8\n\n\n\n                                        b.\n\n      Even if these contingencies were to constitute an imminent\n\ninjury, prudential concerns strongly dictate against the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that this case is ripe for adjudication, for\n\nthere is a substantial possibility that the actions of the new\n\nboard will not violate the court’s orders.                 For example, the new\n\nboard could adopt an inter-district busing and teacher reassignment\n\nplan with the RPSB to comply with the remedial order.                 Such a plan\n\nlikely would moot the controversy.\n\n      Essentially, the threat of noncompliance with the court's\n\norders    will   not   occur   unless    the   new    board   seeks    to    become\n\noperational under Act 973 and then decides to take actions that,\n\nunder the existing caselaw,9 would unconstitutionally interfere\n\n\n      8\n        See Texas v. United States, 118 S. Ct. at 1259 (“A claim is not ripe for\nadjudication if it rests upon “'contingent future events that may not occur as\nanticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.'”) (quoting Thomas v. Union Carbide\nAgric. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 581 (1985)). The existence of a law is not, by\nitself, necessarily sufficient to establish imminent injury. See, e.g., United\nPub. Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 90 (1947) (“A hypothetical threat is not\nenough.”); id. at 91 (“No threat of interference by the Commission with rights\nof these appellants appears beyond that implied in the existence of the law and\nthe regulations.”) (citation omitted).\n      9\n        The Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of “splinter school\ndistricts” in United States v. Scotland Neck City Bd. of Educ., 407 U.S. 484, 490\n(1972), and Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 464-66\n(1972), and this circuit thoroughly considered the issues in Ross v. Houston\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                        10\n\fwith the orders.     Although the RPSB need not wait until an actual\n\ndisruption occurs in order to seek declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief, it should wait at least until there is a concrete threat.\n\nHere, that would mean that it must defer at least until the new\n\nboard is in place and develops a plan for how it proposes to run\n\nthe new district.\n\n     Also important is the need to conserve judicial resources. As\n\nwe have said, this dispute may end up being entirely academic, as\n\nno one can know what a not-yet-elected board will do.          The RPSB and\n\nthe United States have imputed to this yet-to-exist body its worst-\n\ncase parade of horribles.      Both have assumed that the new district\n\nwill do everything it can to thwart the district court’s remedia-\n\ntion of the past de jure segregated school system.                 From the\n\nrecord, there is no basis for that fear.             The ripeness balance\n\ntherefore weighs in favor of waiting to address this controversy.\n\n     Our ripeness holding is underscored by our holding in Ross v.\n\nHouston Indep. Sch. Dist., 577 F.2d 937, 944-45 (5th Cir. 1977)\n\n(per curiam).      There, we made plain the proof needed by the\n\nproponent of the splinter district:\n\n     WISD [the new school district] must, at the outset,\n     establish what its operations will be.

Therefore, the failure to introduce\nevidence necessary to meet the legal standard would be grounds to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim. School desegregation cases, however, are an exception.\nThe party seeking to escape from the court’s remedial authority bears the burden\nof proving that its actions are not intended to re-establish de jure segregation.\nSee Freeman v.

Necessarily, the district court would have to\n\nhold an evidentiary hearing or otherwise provide an avenue for the\n\nparties to introduce evidence.11\n\n      The judgment is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED for\n\nfurther proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\nENDRECORD\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         From Ross, the district court should realize that consideration of all\nthe factors of the Wright test is necessary to inform the use of its remedial\ndiscretion when deciding whether to invalidate the instant state constitutional\namendment and its implementing legislation. See Ross, 559 F.2d at 944 (“The\nright of WISD to implement and operate a new and separate school district partly\nwithin the geographic confines of HISD has never been tested by the criteria\nestablished in these precedents. We remand the case so that the district court\ncan make the required assay.”).\n\n                                      13\n\fWISDOM, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n     I respectfully dissent.\n\n     This case is so bursting with over-ripeness that it emits an\n\nunpleasant odor.\n\n     Should this case be sent back to the district court, the\n\ndistrict judge will find again the controlling fact already well\n\nknown to the district judge, a life-long Alexandrian and a federal\n\ndistrict   judge   since   his   appointment   in   October   1970.    The\n\ncontrolling fact, well known to Louisiana and to this Court, is\n\nthat the area covered by the ninth, tenth, and eleventh wards of\n\nthe eleven wards in Rapides Parish is clearly defined as the\n\npredominantly white section of Alexandria.             It is admittedly\n\neighty-seven per cent white, and may be more.                 The proposed\n\nmajority opinion is, therefore, a blatant attempt to establish a\n\nspecial public school district for whites in a limited area known\n\nas the white section of Alexandria.\n\n     The notion expressed in the first sentence of the proposed\n\nmajority opinion that the enabling legislation was “designed to\n\ndivide the Rapides Parish School District into two districts”, is\n\nindeed an admission of the fact that the plan is an attempt to\n\nestablish de jure segregation in Alexandria public schools -- at\n\nleast for the time it will take to overcome stalling and for the\n\ncase to be decided en banc or for it to reach the United States\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n\n\n                                    14\n\f     The enabling legislation is directly contrary to Brown,12 Brown\n\nII,13 and to Bolling v. Sharpe,14 and to the spirit of numerous\n\ndecisions of this Court.\n\n     The time to stop it is now.15\n\n     It is incredible that half a century after Brown, one should\n\nhave to ask for an en banc judgment to prevent the establishment of\n\na school for whites in a public school system.    That is necessary\n\nin this case where ripeness “is a cape for unauthorized appellate\n\n\n\n     12\n          347 U.S. 483 (1954).\n     13\n          349 U.S. 294 (1955).\n     14\n          347 U.S. 497 (1954).\n     15\n          The majority is willing to accept Wright v. City of\nEmporia, 407 U.S. 451 (1972). Fine. The true “test” from Wright\nand the similar case of United States v. Scotland Neck City B. Of\nEduc.,407 U.S. 484, 490 (1972), is “whether [the splinter district\nplan] hinders or furthers the process of desegregation. If the\nproposal would impede the dismantling of a dual system, then a\ndistrict court, in the exercise of its remedial discretion, may\nenjoin it from being carried out”. Ross v. Houston Ind. School Dist.,\n559 F.2d 937, 943 (5th Cir. 1977).\n\n     Wright, like the Rapides case, involved a school district\nunder court order to dismantle a dual educational system. 407 U.S.\nat 455-9. The Wright court’s chief concern with the creation of a\nsplinter school district was that the division would impede the\nefforts to dismantle the dual system. The court held that “a new\nschool district may not be created where its effect would be to\nimpede the process of dismantling the dual system.” Id. at 470.\nThis point is important. The obvious effect of the plan to divide\nthe Rapides Parish School District is the creation of a\npredominately white school district north of the Red River and a\npredominately black school district south of the Red River. There\nis no justification for considering the current plan two or three\nyears down the road, thanks to the appellate process. The court\nmust now consider the racial makeup of the new district.\n\n\n                                 15\n\frule making”.16 Here, however, the cape has rubbed hard against the\n\nrock of controlling fact.

The program continues to this day\n\nand involves extensive busing and other means to achieve racial\n\nparity.    The district court remains active in redrawing the lines\n\nof attendance at schoolsSSat regular intervalsSSin order to maintain\n\nracial balance and in managing other aspects of running the RPSB.\n\n     At issue in this case are Wards 9, 10, and 11 of Rapides\n\nParish (the “northern wards”), all north of the Red River.            These\n\nwards are primarily white, while the remaining wardsSSlocated in\n\nthe city of Alexandria, south of the riverSSare more racially\n\nmixed.    The northern wards areSSand have beenSSpart of the RPSB.\n\n     Throughout the litigation, the district court has made a\n\ncontinuing effort to maintain racial balance in the city schools of\n\nAlexandria.    Accordingly, the court has ordered the RPSB to bus\n\nwhite students from these suburbs to the city and to do the\n\nopposite with non-white students from the city. The district court\n\n\n                                     3\n\fhas been hindered in its quest for racial balance, however, by\n\nincreases in white flight and in black enrollment.\n\n     In 1995, the state legislature approved a ballot measure to\n\nchange the state constitution to form a separate school district in\n\nthe northern wards and to allow it to elect its own school board.\n\nThe measure was approved by state voters and proclaimed part of the\n\nstate constitution by the governor in November 1995.         See LA. CONST.\n\nart. VIII, § 13(D), and advisory notes.\n\n     Contemporaneously,      the       legislature       passed     enabling\n\nlegislationSSAct   973SSto   provide,    among   other    things,   for   the\n\ndrawing of election districts for the members of the new district’s\n\nboard.

At the\n\n\n                                   4\n\fdistrict court’s request, the RPSB served notice on the state\n\nattorney general, who is the officer statutorily obliged to defend\n\nthe state’s laws.\n\n      The attorney general filed a response opposing the declaratory\n\njudgment but did not have the opportunity to introduce evidence in\n\nsupport of the law.2           Instead, he argued that a declaratory\n\njudgment was improper because the claim is not ripe for review.\n\nEven if it were ripe, he reasoned, the law does not unconstitution-\n\nally infringe on the district court’s remedial authority.\n\n      The district court found that there was a ripe case or\n\ncontroversy    needed    to   sustain    a   declaratory    judgment    action,\n\nbecause the school district faced substantial uncertainty and\n\nexpense   if   subjected      to   the   possibility   of   adhering    to   two\n\nconflicting obligationsSSone imposed by the state constitution and\n\nthe other by the federal court.              See id. at 98.      Reaching the\n\nmerits, the court relied on the fact that without the northern\n\nwards, there would be fewer white children in the remaining school\n\ndistrict. The resulting RPSB would become slightly more black than\n\nwhite, while the new district would be overwhelmingly white.3                The\n\ncourt held that because of this change in racial balance, Act 973\n\nimpermissibly infringes on its remedial powers and thus offends the\n\n\n\n      2\n        The district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing before it entered\nits order.\n      3\n        The students residing in the remaining RPSB would be 60% black and 40%\nwhite, while those residing in the new district would be 87% white and 13% black.\n\n                                         5\n\ffederal Constitution.

Under\n\nthe Article III analysis, there is no imminent threat of harm to\n\nthe RPSB or to the desegregation decrees.       As the district court\n\nfound, there is a potential threat of harm.            RPSB could be\n\nsubjected to conflicting obligations of the federal court and the\n\nstate constitution. The harm’s probability of occurrence, however,\n\nis sufficiently remoteSSgiven the myriad of contingencies necessary\n\nfor it to developSSthat it fails to constitute the immediate harm\n\nnecessary for Article III justiciability.\n\n     In order for the RPSB to face an imminent risk of violation of\n\nthe desegregation order, too many contingencies would have to\n\noccur.   There would have to be a new district in the northern wards\n\nwith a proposed plan that would unconstitutionally interfere with\n\nthe court’s remedial authority.        For that to occur, there would\n\nhave to be a proposed plan about how the new district would operate\n\nin relation to the RPSB.   For that to occur, there would have to be\n\nan election of a new board.     And for that to occur, there would\n\nhave to be Justice Department preclearance of the new voting\n\n\n                                  9\n\fdistricts.    Because any one of these numerous links may not come to\n\nbe,   the    string    of   contingencies      is    too   tenuous    to    support\n\nripeness.8\n\n\n\n                                        b.\n\n      Even if these contingencies were to constitute an imminent\n\ninjury, prudential concerns strongly dictate against the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that this case is ripe for adjudication, for\n\nthere is a substantial possibility that the actions of the new\n\nboard will not violate the court’s orders.                 For example, the new\n\nboard could adopt an inter-district busing and teacher reassignment\n\nplan with the RPSB to comply with the remedial order.                 Such a plan\n\nlikely would moot the controversy.\n\n      Essentially, the threat of noncompliance with the court's\n\norders    will   not   occur   unless    the   new    board   seeks    to    become\n\noperational under Act 973 and then decides to take actions that,\n\nunder the existing caselaw,9 would unconstitutionally interfere\n\n\n      8\n        See Texas v.

The RPSB and\n\nthe United States have imputed to this yet-to-exist body its worst-\n\ncase parade of horribles.

The\n\ncontrolling fact, well known to Louisiana and to this Court, is\n\nthat the area covered by the ninth, tenth, and eleventh wards of\n\nthe eleven wards in Rapides Parish is clearly defined as the\n\npredominantly white section of Alexandria.             It is admittedly\n\neighty-seven per cent white, and may be more.                 The proposed\n\nmajority opinion is, therefore, a blatant attempt to establish a\n\nspecial public school district for whites in a limited area known\n\nas the white section of Alexandria.\n\n     The notion expressed in the first sentence of the proposed\n\nmajority opinion that the enabling legislation was “designed to\n\ndivide the Rapides Parish School District into two districts”, is\n\nindeed an admission of the fact that the plan is an attempt to\n\nestablish de jure segregation in Alexandria public schools -- at\n\nleast for the time it will take to overcome stalling and for the\n\ncase to be decided en banc or for it to reach the United States\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n\n\n                                    14\n\f     The enabling legislation is directly contrary to Brown,12 Brown\n\nII,13 and to Bolling v.
