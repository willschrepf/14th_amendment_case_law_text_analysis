She also\n\nsued Appellant East Texas Medical Center EMS (ETMC), her and Cox’s employer, for\n\nsexual harassment, ratification, and negligent retention and supervision. A jury found\n\nfor Nieves on all her claims, and the trial court entered judgment for her against Cox\n\nand ETMC, who have both appealed. While this appeal was pending, Nieves and\n\nETMC resolved the judgment as to ETMC and have filed an agreed motion to dismiss,\n\nwhich we will address below. As to Cox’s appeal, we will affirm.\n\f                                          Cox’s Appeal\n\n       In issues one, two, and five, Cox asserts that the evidence is legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that Cox assaulted and sexually assaulted\n\nNieves and that he acted with malice toward Nieves. In reviewing the legal sufficiency\n\nof the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n\ncrediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary\n\nevidence unless reasonable jurors could not. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807,\n\n822 (Tex. 2005). There is legally insufficient evidence or “no evidence” of a vital fact\n\nwhen (a) there is a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (b) the court is barred by\n\nrules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a\n\nvital fact; (c) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or\n\n(d) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact. Merrell Dow\n\nPharms., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997).          In reviewing the factual\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, we must consider and weigh all of the evidence, not just the\n\nevidence that supports the verdict. Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406-\n\n07 (Tex. 1998); Checker Bag Co. v. Washington, 27 S.W.3d 625, 633 (Tex. App.—Waco 2000,\n\npet. denied). We will set aside the finding only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence that the finding is clearly wrong and unjust. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d at\n\n407.\n\n       The charge set out the following elements for assault:\n\n              A person commits an assault if he (1) intentionally, knowingly or\n       recklessly causes bodily injury to another; (2) intentionally or knowingly\n       threatens another with imminent bodily injury; or (3) intentionally or\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                                  Page 2\n\f       knowingly causes physical contact with another when he knows or should\n       reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or\n       provocative.\n\n       The jury question on sexual assault included the following on consent:\n\n       A sexual assault is without the consent of the other person if:\n\n       (1) the actor compels the other person to submit or participate by the use\n           of physical force or violence;\n\n       (2) the actor compels the other person to submit or participate by\n           threatening to use force or violence against the other person, and the\n           other person believes that the actor has the present ability to execute\n           the threat; or\n\n       (3) the other person has not consented and the actor knows the other\n           person is unconscious or physically unable to resist.\n\n       Cox, a paramedic, and Nieves, an EMT, worked three 24-hour shifts together. As\n\nfor the assault claim, Nieves testified that Cox tried to hold her hand in the ambulance,\n\npushed her up against a wall and tried to kiss her, and grabbed her on the buttocks.\n\nShe said that these behaviors were unwanted and that she communicated that to Cox.\n\nNieves did not report this conduct to her superiors until after sexual harassment\n\nallegations had been made against her.\n\n       As for the sexual assault, Cox had just spent two days in jail after being arrested\n\nfor assaulting his wife, who was having an affair. Nieves said that Cox showed up at\n\nher apartment uninvited. Nieves testified that, after talking for a while, Cox put his\n\nhand on her shoulder, pushed her down to the floor and on her back, and, while\n\nholding both her wrists above her head, began to have intercourse with her. Nieves\n\nsaid, “No, please don’t,” but did not fight off Cox. She stared out the window, waiting\n\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                              Page 3\n\ffor it to be over. Nieves felt numb, wanted to forget it had happened, and did not want\n\nto tell anyone about. She did not tell anyone about it until a few days later, when she\n\nwas being investigated for sexual harassment.\n\n       Cox said that he called Nieves after getting out of jail and told her he was coming\n\nto her apartment, and she gave him directions. She invited him in when he arrived.\n\nWhile she was sitting at her computer, he began to give her a neck and back rub.\n\nNieves moved to the floor, and Cox continued the back rub. He then removed her\n\npants and underwear, performed oral sex on her, and then had intercourse with her.\n\nHe said that the sex was consensual, that Nieves appeared to enjoy it, and that she\n\nnever asked him to stop.\n\n       In complaining about the sufficiency of the evidence, Cox points out that Nieves\n\nand Cox worked a shift together the next day and did not act like someone who had\n\nbeen sexually assaulted. Nieves said that she worked the shift because she was out of\n\nsick days and did not want to have to tell anyone why she did not want to work with\n\nCox. Cox also points to electronic pages that Nieves had sent to Cox before the alleged\n\nsexual assault and asserts that they show Nieves was romantically interested in Cox\n\nand that Cox’s version is thus more credible. Nieves, however, testified about the\n\ncontext of the pages and explained how, in the context in which she sent them, they\n\nwere not romantic. Instead, she was trying to just be friends with Cox and fit in with\n\nhim and her other male co-workers, some of whom she says she sent pages to as well.\n\n       Cox, citing to City of Keller v. Wilson, asserts that we must consider the entire\n\ncontext, circumstances, conversations, writings, acts, and relationships between the\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                             Page 4\n\fparties in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 811-12.\n\nWe agree, but we may not intrude on the jury’s credibility determinations.\n\n               [W]e must not substitute our opinion on witness credibility for that\n       of the jury. Id. at 816-17.\n\n             Jurors are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the\n       weight to give their testimony. They may choose to believe one witness\n       and disbelieve another. Reviewing courts cannot impose their own\n       opinions to the contrary.\n\n              Most credibility questions are implicit rather than explicit in a\n       jury’s verdict. Thus, reviewing courts must assume jurors decided all of\n       them in favor of the verdict if reasonable human beings could do so.\n       Courts reviewing all the evidence in a light favorable to the verdict thus\n       assume that jurors credited testimony favorable to the verdict and\n       disbelieved testimony contrary to it.\n\n               …\n\n              Of course, “[t]he jury’s decisions regarding credibility must be\n       reasonable.” Jurors cannot ignore undisputed testimony that is clear,\n       positive, direct, otherwise credible, free from contradictions and\n       inconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted. And as noted\n       above, they are not free to believe testimony that is conclusively negated\n       by undisputed facts. But whenever reasonable jurors could decide what\n       testimony to discard, a reviewing court must assume they did so in favor\n       of their verdict, and disregard it in the course of legal sufficiency review.\n\n       Id. at 819-20 (footnotes and citations omitted).\n\nHunter v. Ford Motor Co., 305 S.W.3d 202, 206 (Tex. App.—Waco 2009, no pet.).\n\n       And in a factual-sufficiency review,\n\n              We must also remember that it is within the province of the jury to\n       determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their\n       testimony. Brush v. Reata Oil & Gas Corp., 984 S.W.2d 720, 725-26 (Tex.\n       App.—Waco 1998, pet. denied). The trier of fact may believe one witness\n       and disbelieve another. McGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 697 (Tex.\n       1986). It may resolve inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness, and it\n       may accept lay testimony over that of experts. Id. We may not pass upon\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                                Page 5\n\f       a witness’s credibility or substitute our judgment for that of the jury, even\n       if the evidence might clearly support a different result. Maritime Overseas\n       Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 407 (Tex. 1998) (citing Pool v. Ford Motor Co.,\n       715 S.W.2d 629, 634 (Tex. 1986)).\n\nId. at 206-07 (quoting O’Connor v. Wilson, 127 S.W.3d 249, 254 (Tex. App.—Waco 2003,\n\npet. denied)).\n\n       By their verdict, obviously, the jury believed Nieves and did not believe Cox, and\n\nit was not unreasonable for the jury to do so, based on all the evidence. The evidence is\n\nlegally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s assault and sexual assault findings.\n\nAnd by finding that Cox assaulted and sexually assaulted Nieves, the jury’s malice\n\nfinding against Cox is also supported by legally and factually sufficient evidence. We\n\noverrule issues one, two, and five.\n\n       In issue four, Cox complains that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient\n\nto support the jury’s answer to Question 10, which awarded Nieves $750,000 in\n\ndamages for past physical pain and mental anguish and $250,000 in future physical\n\npain and mental anguish. Cox asserts that Nieves did not offer any evidence that she\n\nwas harmed by Cox’s assaults (as opposed to the sexual assault.) As for the sexual\n\nassault, Nieves testified that it made her feel “overwhelmed” and unable to answer the\n\ndoor even for her children. She felt numb and empty and tried to repress the sexual\n\nassault. She was afraid that if anyone heard about it, they would not be willing to work\n\nwith her.\n\n       She would not let anyone in her apartment, see anyone, or get out of bed. She\n\nfelt anger, embarrassment, and humiliation; she felt violated and still had a fear of\n\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                                  Page 6\n\fletting a male other than her husband or children into her house, including her father-\n\nin-law. She sometimes kept her children home from school because of her fear of being\n\nalone. Nieves said she has problems leaving the house, cannot be around people, and\n\navoids interaction. She missed all of her son’s soccer games, except for one, and even\n\nthen had to watch from the truck. Nieves testified that she is sad because she feels her\n\nfears cause her to shortchange her family and miss out on things. She sometimes has\n\nfeelings of worthlessness and flashbacks of the events, and she has nightmares and\n\ntrouble sleeping. When she pictures in her mind the assault, she sometimes feels sick to\n\nher stomach and shakes.\n\n       We find that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s\n\ndamage findings. Issue four is overruled.\n\n       Issue three complains that because Question 10 was submitted in broad form as\n\nto Nieves’s two claims against Cox and her negligent retention and supervision claim\n\nagainst ETMC, the compensatory damages cannot be upheld if the evidence for any one\n\nunderlying claim is legally or factually insufficient. But we have held that sufficient\n\nevidence supports the assault and sexual assault claims, and the negligence claim\n\nagainst ETMC is no longer before us. Moreover, Cox did not object to the broad-form\n\nsubmission of Question 10 and its lack of segregation as to the three claims. See In re\n\nA.V., 113 S.W.3d 355, 362 (Tex. 2003); Haskett v. Butts, 83 S.W.3d 213, 219-20 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Waco 2002, pet. denied); Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. v. Cottey, 72 S.W.3d 735,\n\n747 (Tex. App.—Waco 2002, no pet.). Issue three is overruled.\n\n       The jury (and the judgment) awarded Nieves $50,000 in exemplary damages\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                             Page 7\n\fagainst Cox. In issue six, Cox asserts, similar to issue three, that because the exemplary\n\ndamages question was not segregated, if either the assault or sexual assault claim is\n\noverturned, the exemplary damages award must be reversed. Again, we have held that\n\nsufficient evidence supports the assault and sexual assault claims, and Cox did not\n\nobject to the lack of segregation in the exemplary damages question.             Issue six is\n\noverruled.\n\n       Issue seven asserts that because the compensatory damages question was not\n\nsegregated between Cox and ETMC, a ratio analysis cannot be done to determine\n\nwhether the exemplary damages award is excessive under due-process concerns. See\n\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 418, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 1520, 155\n\nL.Ed.2d 585 (2003). We note again that Cox did not object to Question 10. Furthermore,\n\nthe $50,000 exemplary damages award, compared to the $1 million in compensatory\n\ndamages awarded to Nieves against Cox (jointly and severally) for assault and sexual\n\nassault, cannot be said to violate due process.       Issue seven is overruled.      Having\n\noverruled all of Cox’s issues, we affirm the trial court’s judgment as to Cox.\n\n                                          ETMC’s Appeal\n\n       In an agreed motion by ETMC and Nieves, the parties informed the Court that\n\nthey have resolved this matter, and they jointly request this Court (1) to dismiss the\n\nappeal of ETMC, with each side bearing their own costs, (2) to set aside the trial court’s\n\njudgment as to ETMC without regard to the merits of Nieves’s claims, (3) to direct the\n\ntrial court to dismiss with prejudice all claims brought against ETMC, with each party\n\nbearing their own costs, and (4) to order a discharge of all obligations of the surety,\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v.

Ellis, 971 S.W.2d at\n\n407.\n\n       The charge set out the following elements for assault:\n\n              A person commits an assault if he (1) intentionally, knowingly or\n       recklessly causes bodily injury to another; (2) intentionally or knowingly\n       threatens another with imminent bodily injury; or (3) intentionally or\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                                  Page 2\n\f       knowingly causes physical contact with another when he knows or should\n       reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or\n       provocative.\n\n       The jury question on sexual assault included the following on consent:\n\n       A sexual assault is without the consent of the other person if:\n\n       (1) the actor compels the other person to submit or participate by the use\n           of physical force or violence;\n\n       (2) the actor compels the other person to submit or participate by\n           threatening to use force or violence against the other person, and the\n           other person believes that the actor has the present ability to execute\n           the threat; or\n\n       (3) the other person has not consented and the actor knows the other\n           person is unconscious or physically unable to resist.\n\n       Cox, a paramedic, and Nieves, an EMT, worked three 24-hour shifts together. As\n\nfor the assault claim, Nieves testified that Cox tried to hold her hand in the ambulance,\n\npushed her up against a wall and tried to kiss her, and grabbed her on the buttocks.\n\nShe said that these behaviors were unwanted and that she communicated that to Cox.\n\nNieves did not report this conduct to her superiors until after sexual harassment\n\nallegations had been made against her.\n\n       As for the sexual assault, Cox had just spent two days in jail after being arrested\n\nfor assaulting his wife, who was having an affair. Nieves said that Cox showed up at\n\nher apartment uninvited. Nieves testified that, after talking for a while, Cox put his\n\nhand on her shoulder, pushed her down to the floor and on her back, and, while\n\nholding both her wrists above her head, began to have intercourse with her. Nieves\n\nsaid, “No, please don’t,” but did not fight off Cox. She stared out the window, waiting\n\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                              Page 3\n\ffor it to be over. Nieves felt numb, wanted to forget it had happened, and did not want\n\nto tell anyone about. She did not tell anyone about it until a few days later, when she\n\nwas being investigated for sexual harassment.\n\n       Cox said that he called Nieves after getting out of jail and told her he was coming\n\nto her apartment, and she gave him directions. She invited him in when he arrived.\n\nWhile she was sitting at her computer, he began to give her a neck and back rub.\n\nNieves moved to the floor, and Cox continued the back rub. He then removed her\n\npants and underwear, performed oral sex on her, and then had intercourse with her.\n\nHe said that the sex was consensual, that Nieves appeared to enjoy it, and that she\n\nnever asked him to stop.\n\n       In complaining about the sufficiency of the evidence, Cox points out that Nieves\n\nand Cox worked a shift together the next day and did not act like someone who had\n\nbeen sexually assaulted. Nieves said that she worked the shift because she was out of\n\nsick days and did not want to have to tell anyone why she did not want to work with\n\nCox. Cox also points to electronic pages that Nieves had sent to Cox before the alleged\n\nsexual assault and asserts that they show Nieves was romantically interested in Cox\n\nand that Cox’s version is thus more credible. Nieves, however, testified about the\n\ncontext of the pages and explained how, in the context in which she sent them, they\n\nwere not romantic. Instead, she was trying to just be friends with Cox and fit in with\n\nhim and her other male co-workers, some of whom she says she sent pages to as well.\n\n       Cox, citing to City of Keller v. Wilson, asserts that we must consider the entire\n\ncontext, circumstances, conversations, writings, acts, and relationships between the\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                             Page 4\n\fparties in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 811-12.\n\nWe agree, but we may not intrude on the jury’s credibility determinations.\n\n               [W]e must not substitute our opinion on witness credibility for that\n       of the jury. Id. at 816-17.\n\n             Jurors are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the\n       weight to give their testimony. They may choose to believe one witness\n       and disbelieve another. Reviewing courts cannot impose their own\n       opinions to the contrary.\n\n              Most credibility questions are implicit rather than explicit in a\n       jury’s verdict. Thus, reviewing courts must assume jurors decided all of\n       them in favor of the verdict if reasonable human beings could do so.\n       Courts reviewing all the evidence in a light favorable to the verdict thus\n       assume that jurors credited testimony favorable to the verdict and\n       disbelieved testimony contrary to it.\n\n               …\n\n              Of course, “[t]he jury’s decisions regarding credibility must be\n       reasonable.” Jurors cannot ignore undisputed testimony that is clear,\n       positive, direct, otherwise credible, free from contradictions and\n       inconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted. And as noted\n       above, they are not free to believe testimony that is conclusively negated\n       by undisputed facts. But whenever reasonable jurors could decide what\n       testimony to discard, a reviewing court must assume they did so in favor\n       of their verdict, and disregard it in the course of legal sufficiency review.\n\n       Id. at 819-20 (footnotes and citations omitted).\n\nHunter v.

App.—Waco 2003,\n\npet. denied)).\n\n       By their verdict, obviously, the jury believed Nieves and did not believe Cox, and\n\nit was not unreasonable for the jury to do so, based on all the evidence. The evidence is\n\nlegally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s assault and sexual assault findings.\n\nAnd by finding that Cox assaulted and sexually assaulted Nieves, the jury’s malice\n\nfinding against Cox is also supported by legally and factually sufficient evidence. We\n\noverrule issues one, two, and five.\n\n       In issue four, Cox complains that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient\n\nto support the jury’s answer to Question 10, which awarded Nieves $750,000 in\n\ndamages for past physical pain and mental anguish and $250,000 in future physical\n\npain and mental anguish. Cox asserts that Nieves did not offer any evidence that she\n\nwas harmed by Cox’s assaults (as opposed to the sexual assault.) As for the sexual\n\nassault, Nieves testified that it made her feel “overwhelmed” and unable to answer the\n\ndoor even for her children. She felt numb and empty and tried to repress the sexual\n\nassault. She was afraid that if anyone heard about it, they would not be willing to work\n\nwith her.\n\n       She would not let anyone in her apartment, see anyone, or get out of bed. She\n\nfelt anger, embarrassment, and humiliation; she felt violated and still had a fear of\n\n\nEast Texas Medical Center EMS v. Nieves                                                  Page 6\n\fletting a male other than her husband or children into her house, including her father-\n\nin-law. She sometimes kept her children home from school because of her fear of being\n\nalone. Nieves said she has problems leaving the house, cannot be around people, and\n\navoids interaction. She missed all of her son’s soccer games, except for one, and even\n\nthen had to watch from the truck. Nieves testified that she is sad because she feels her\n\nfears cause her to shortchange her family and miss out on things. She sometimes has\n\nfeelings of worthlessness and flashbacks of the events, and she has nightmares and\n\ntrouble sleeping. When she pictures in her mind the assault, she sometimes feels sick to\n\nher stomach and shakes.\n\n       We find that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s\n\ndamage findings. Issue four is overruled.\n\n       Issue three complains that because Question 10 was submitted in broad form as\n\nto Nieves’s two claims against Cox and her negligent retention and supervision claim\n\nagainst ETMC, the compensatory damages cannot be upheld if the evidence for any one\n\nunderlying claim is legally or factually insufficient. But we have held that sufficient\n\nevidence supports the assault and sexual assault claims, and the negligence claim\n\nagainst ETMC is no longer before us. Moreover, Cox did not object to the broad-form\n\nsubmission of Question 10 and its lack of segregation as to the three claims.

Nieves                                             Page 7\n\fagainst Cox. In issue six, Cox asserts, similar to issue three, that because the exemplary\n\ndamages question was not segregated, if either the assault or sexual assault claim is\n\noverturned, the exemplary damages award must be reversed. Again, we have held that\n\nsufficient evidence supports the assault and sexual assault claims, and Cox did not\n\nobject to the lack of segregation in the exemplary damages question.             Issue six is\n\noverruled.\n\n       Issue seven asserts that because the compensatory damages question was not\n\nsegregated between Cox and ETMC, a ratio analysis cannot be done to determine\n\nwhether the exemplary damages award is excessive under due-process concerns.

Furthermore,\n\nthe $50,000 exemplary damages award, compared to the $1 million in compensatory\n\ndamages awarded to Nieves against Cox (jointly and severally) for assault and sexual\n\nassault, cannot be said to violate due process.
