Alarcün, United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit, sitting\nby designation.\n\f                                          I\n\n      Appellants Hallmark Developers, Inc. and Charles Garrison (collectively,\n\n“Hallmark”) appeal from (1) the summary judgment in favor of Appellee Fulton\n\nCounty, Georgia (“the County”) on their intentional discrimination claim based on\n\nthe Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq. (“FHA”); and (2) the judgment\n\nentered following a bench trial on the merits on their discriminatory impact claim\n\nbased on the FHA.\n\n      The District Court concluded that Hallmark had failed to adduce evidence\n\nthat the County had intentionally discriminated on the basis of race when it\n\nrefused to re-zone a parcel of property in order for Hallmark to build, inter alia,\n\nhomes affordable to households with low and moderate incomes. The District\n\nCourt also concluded that Hallmark failed to demonstrate that the re-zoning\n\ndecision had a significant disparate impact on minorities. Hallmark argues that (1)\n\nthe District Court failed to consider relevant evidence of discriminatory intent; (2)\n\nwas clearly in error in its finding regarding disparate impact; and (3) considered\n\nexpert testimony that should have been excluded under Rule 702 of the Federal\n\nRules of Evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                                             II\n\n       For many years, Chris Doughtie, president of Hallmark, received literature\n\nand invitations to attend business functions in South Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nThis literature identified South Fulton County as a “development target and\n\nadvised developers of the incentives to encourage development in the corridor.”\n\n       Accordingly, Hallmark and Appellant Charles Garrison acquired property in\n\nSouth Fulton County (“the Property”) with the express intention of developing it\n\nfor a mixture of uses, including commercial, office, and residential. Specifically,\n\nthey hoped to construct a large development consisting of apartments, townhomes\n\nsingle-family homes, and office space. The townhomes and single-family homes\n\nwould be built under the control of Hallmark. The apartments would be built by a\n\ncontractor subject to conditions imposed by Hallmark. Hallmark intended that a\n\nlarge percentage of the homes would be “affordable,” as defined by the\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).1 The Property would\n\nhave to be re-zoned from AG-1 (agricultural) to MIX (mixed use) in order for this\n\ndevelopment to take place.\n\n       In early 2001, Mr. Doughtie arranged for a visit to Chestnut Lake, a low-\n\n\n       1\n        Under HUD definitions, housing is “affordable” if a person making 80% of the annual\nmedian income for a given geographical area pays 30% or less of gross monthly income for\nmortgage and utilities or rent and utilities. See 24 C.F.R. §§ 92.2, 92.252, 92.254.\n\n                                              3\n\fincome, single-family subdivision that Hallmark had developed in DeKalb\n\nCounty, Georgia. Among others, he invited Fulton County Commissioner William\n\nEdwards, Fulton County Assistant Director of Comprehensive Planning Beth\n\nMcMillan, and Fulton County Economic Development Director Joseph Johnson.\n\nThe purpose of the visit was to acquaint these county officials with the sort of\n\ndevelopment Hallmark intended to make on the Property.\n\n       Chestnut Lake contains 700 lots. The homes initially were priced in the\n\nrange of $89,000 to $130,000, but after changes were made, the price range was\n\nfrom approximately $120,000 to $150,000. The homes were built by Mayfield\n\nHomes, which is owned in part by Mr. Doughtie and his son. Mr. Doughtie told\n\nthe county officials that Mayfield Homes would build the single-family homes on\n\nthe Property as well, and that the homes on the Property would be similar in\n\nappearance and layout to those at Chestnut Lake.\n\n       During this visit, none of the county officials expressed any concern\n\nregarding the quality of the Chestnut Lake development.2 Commissioner Edwards,\n\nhowever, cautioned Mr. Doughtie to involve South Fulton community associations\n\n\n       2\n        In its order on summary judgment, the District Court stated that it was undisputed that no\nconcerns regarding quality were expressed. At trial, Commissioner Edwards testified that he had\nconcerns over the quality of the homes. He felt, among other things, that they were “very\ngeneric,” had very small rooms, and “just looked like row houses.” It is not clear whether he\nexpressed these concerns to Mr. Doughtie.\n\n                                                4\n\fin the re-zoning process to “get the community happy.” Among the community\n\ngroups Commissioner Edwards listed were the South Fulton Parkway Alliance, the\n\nCliffondale Community Association, and Green South Fulton (“the community\n\ngroups”).\n\n      On October 30, 2001, Hallmark filed an application with the Fulton County\n\nDepartment of Environment and Community Development seeking to re-zone the\n\nProperty. Kathryn Zickert appeared before the Board of Commissioners (“the\n\nBoard”) on behalf of Hallmark at a public hearing on February 6, 2002. The\n\nBoard granted a 60-day deferral to allow Hallmark to engage in discussions with\n\nthe community groups regarding the proposed development.\n\n      On April 3, 2002, Ms. Zickert appeared before the Board on behalf of\n\nHallmark a second time. After the public hearing, Commissioner Edwards (who is\n\ncommissioner of the district where the Property is located) moved to deny\n\nHallmark’s re-zoning application “based on the quality of what [he’d] seen and\n\nthings [he’d] heard.” Chairman Mike Kenn supported Commissioner Edwards’s\n\nmotion. He stated that the development was “probably one of the poorest-\n\ndesigned, laid out subdivisions [he’d] ever seen.” Another commissioner made a\n\nsubstitute motion for an additional 60-day deferral, and the Board granted the\n\ndeferral so that Hallmark could continue to discuss unresolved issues with the\n\n                                         5\n\fcommunity groups.\n\n      On June 5, 2002, Ms. Zickert appeared before the Board on behalf of\n\nHallmark a third and final time. Commissioner Edwards moved to deny the\n\napplication due to the lack of improvement “in terms of the quality of the site plan\n\nand the site plan design.” Hallmark’s re-zoning application was denied.\n\n      While Hallmark’s application for re-zoning was pending, Mr. Doughtie, his\n\ncolleagues, and his attorneys met with the community groups as suggested by\n\nCommissioner Edwards. During the meetings, community group members\n\nexpressed opposition to the proposed development on the Property. Three\n\ncommunity leaders, Abby Jordan, Dave Robinson, and Larry Hyde stated that they\n\nopposed the proposed development because it was likely to attract “blacks” and\n\nfamilies with children to the area. Another community activist, Bruce Moody,\n\nstated that he did not want poor black people moving into low-rent, lower priced\n\nhomes in South Fulton County.\n\n      On January 26, 2001, at a meeting with a community group, Hallmark’s\n\ncounsel heard Commissioner Edwards say to Ms. Jordan, “I know a lot of your\n\nobjections to projects like [Hallmark’s] proposed development, is a black issue.”\n\nThe community groups also objected to the quality of the proposed homes, “made\n\ndemands which drove up the prices of homes,” and “did not want apartments in\n\n                                         6\n\fanything but luxury form.” Hallmark agreed to many of the changes in the quality\n\nof the development that the community groups suggested.\n\n       Hallmark did not produce evidence that any racist remarks were made at the\n\nhearings in front of the Board. Although Hallmark contends that “subtle remarks\n\nwere made by no fewer than three activists” to the Board at the second hearing on\n\nApril 3, 2002, Hallmark does not state exactly what the remarks were.3 The\n\nCounty points out that one member of the community stated:\n\n              What I’m saying is that we have no choices that are over\n              [$150,000, with reference to the price of the homes].\n              And what I’m trying to get at is if we just keep building\n              houses that are all under 150, we will never raise the bar\n              in South Fulton. We will never bring in the kind of\n              development that I thought this Commission envisioned.\n\nThe same community member later referred to the “apartment challenge” and “the\n\ntransient part of that.” Commissioner Emma Darnell responded:\n\n              That’s a bad argument to bring to me. Let the approach\n              have something to do with some objective measurement\n              of the quality of life. Talk to me about environment.\n              Talk to me about traffic. Let’s not bring our personal\n              aesthetic prejudices and biases to the table . . . this\n              County Commission is not going to close its doors to\n              ordinary working people who also want to live and have\n              nice houses.\n\n\n\n       3\n       The gist of the statements appears to be that the community members wanted the\ndevelopment to be more upscale.\n\n                                             7\n\fCommissioner Nancy Boxill stated: “I don’t want to participate in a zoning\n\nprocess that starts to say what kind of person gets to live where.” Commissioner\n\nEdwards stated:\n\n             Let me just add, too, because I want to thank both my\n             colleagues for bringing out a very good point and a\n             sensitive point because you understand my motion [to\n             deny the re-zoning application] has nothing to do with\n             price. . . But we do talk about price and a lot of times I\n             think we should change that to quality and other things.\n             And that was the basis of my denial.\n\nAnother community member said something about keeping South Fulton Parkway\n\n“pristine.” Commissioner Boxill stated that the community members were\n\ndescribing a “redlining” practice.\n\n      The County’s Planning Staff, Community Zoning Board, the Atlanta\n\nRegional Commission, and the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority\n\nreviewed and repeatedly recommended approval for Hallmark’s zoning\n\napplication. Nevertheless, Commissioner Edwards voted to deny the re-zoning.\n\nHe was apparently influenced by the opposition of the community groups in this\n\ndecision. He stated in his deposition that ninety percent of the zonings that\n\nhappen in South Fulton County are “done real simple between the community and\n\nthe developer.” Zoning applications opposed by such community groups are\n\nusually not approved. Actual voting records confirm that in eighty-nine of ninety-\n\n                                          8\n\ffive instances, Commissioner Edwards’s vote reflected the community’s position.\n\nTypically, other commissioners show “district courtesy” to each other. If a\n\nproposed project is located within one commissioner’s district, the other\n\ncommissioners defer to that commissioner’s wishes.\n\n      Following the denial of its application, Hallmark filed a complaint under the\n\nFHA, contending that the County discriminated on the basis of race in denying its\n\napplication. Hallmark alleged that in giving effect to the racist views of the\n\ncommunity groups, the County acted with intent to discriminate. It also alleged\n\nthat the denial of the re-zoning worked a disparate impact on African-Americans,\n\nwho were more likely to be the purchasers of the homes and renters of the\n\napartments and townhomes on the Property. The District Court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the County with regard to the intentional discrimination\n\nclaim. It concluded that there was no evidence that the County was aware of the\n\nracist views of the community members. It denied the motion for summary\n\njudgment with regard to the disparate impact claim.\n\n      At trial, Hallmark produced an expert witness, Dr. Bradford, who testified\n\nthat the re-zoning decision had a disparate impact on minorities. Specifically, he\n\ntestified that “the elimination of either for sale or rental housing in the lower cost\n\nranges of the proposal for the Hallmark development would disproportionately and\n\n                                           9\n\fadversely affect minority households as compared to white households.” He\n\ncalculated disparity ratios4 based on an assumption that persons who owned homes\n\nor rented apartments in certain “value ranges” in particular geographical areas\n\nwere representative of those who would have purchased or rented homes on the\n\nProperty. Using data from the 2000 United States Census, Dr. Bradford examined\n\nthe race of each homeowner or renter, the individual’s estimate of the value of his\n\nor her home or the amount of rent, and the address of the residence. He examined\n\nthis data in five geographical areas, of increasing size, that surround the Property:\n\n(1) the area within a 10-mile radius of the Property; (2) the area within a 20-mile\n\nradius of the Property; (3) the area within a 30-mile radius of the Property; (4) the\n\n30-mile radius from central Atlanta; and (5) the 20 counties surrounding Atlanta.\n\nHe opined that the 30-mile radius from central Atlanta and the 20-county area\n\nwould be the most reliable indicator of the race of the likely owners or renters on\n\nthe Property.\n\n       Based on the disparity ratios he calculated, Dr. Bradford concluded that\n\nthere would be a statistically significant disparate racial impact arising from the\n\n\n       4\n         A “disparity ratio” is arrived at by dividing the percentage of all minority households\nliving in a certain value or rent range by the percentage of all white households living in that\nsame value or rent range. The underlying percentages are arrived at by dividing, for each racial\ngroup, the total number of households within one value or rent range by the total number of\nhouseholds within all values or rent ranges.\n\n                                               10\n\fdenial of the re-zoning due to the elimination of homes priced below $125,000 and\n\nrental housing costing less than $750 per month.\n\n      The County produced an expert who testified that there is an oversupply of\n\nhousing within the price ranges Dr. Bradford testified were relevant to the\n\ndisparate impact on minorities. Dr. Camilla Johnson Moore, Director of the\n\nFulton County Office of Housing testified that at the time Hallmark’s re-zoning\n\napplication was denied, there was adequate housing for low and moderate income\n\nresidents. She testified there was an “oversaturation.” The District Court credited\n\nthis testimony. It concluded because other housing was available within the price\n\nranges that would allegedly produce the disparate impact, there was no appreciable\n\nimpact on minorities caused by the lack of the particular development Hallmark\n\nwished to construct.\n\n      The District Court also concluded that the impact to which Dr. Bradford\n\ntestified was not significant. In terms of pure percentages (as opposed to disparity\n\nratios), black home purchasers and renters occupied only a slightly larger\n\npercentage of the market than Caucasians in the relevant price ranges.\n\n      Finally, the District Court concluded that Dr. Bradford’s testimony was\n\ninherently speculative. His calculations related to an estimated, hypothetical\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fgroup of individuals.5 Additionally, the District Court found that there was no\n\nguarantee that any of the homes or apartments, if built, would be priced as\n\nHallmark intended. In the Chestnut Lake development, the homes sold for a\n\nhigher price than originally intended. The apartments were not to be built by\n\nHallmark, but by a contractor. Because Dr. Bradford’s opinion regarding\n\ndisparate impact was based on a specific price range, any potential changes in the\n\nprices at which the homes actually sold or the apartments actually rented would\n\naffect the validity of Dr. Bradford’s opinion.\n\n       Having concluded that Dr. Bradford’s testimony failed to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of disparate impact, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the\n\nCounty. Hallmark has timely appealed.\n\n                                              III\n\n                                               A\n\n       Hallmark argues that the District Court erred in entering summary judgment\n\non its claim of intentional discrimination. The District Court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment is reviewed de novo. Summary judgment is appropriate only if there is\n\nno genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n\n\n       5\n          He hypothesized and estimated this group on the assumption that those who currently\nlive in a given home value or rent range would be likely to purchase a home or rent an apartment\nin the same price range on the Property.\n\n                                               12\n\fmatter of law. Lippert v. Cmty. Bank, Inc., 438 F.3d 1275, 1278 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\n      The FHA prohibits the “refus[al] to sell or rent . . . or otherwise make\n\nunavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,\n\nor national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). In order to prevail on a claim under the\n\nFHA, a plaintiff must demonstrate “unequal treatment on the basis of race that\n\naffects the availability of housing.” Jackson v. Okaloosa County Fla., 21 F.3d\n\n1531, 1542 (11th Cir. 1994). Housing may become unavailable within the\n\nmeaning of the FHA as a result of zoning decisions that effectively prohibit the\n\nconstruction of housing. Id. at 1542 n.17.\n\n      To prove that a zoning decision was based on intentional discrimination, a\n\nplaintiff must “establish that race played some role” in the decision. Sofarelli v.\n\nPinellas County, 931 F.2d 718, 722 (11th Cir. 1991).\n\n             Because explicit statements of racially discriminatory\n             motivation are decreasing, circumstantial evidence must\n             often be used to establish the requisite intent. Among\n             the factors that are instructive in determining whether\n             racially discriminatory intent is present are:\n             discriminatory or segregative effect, historical\n             background, the sequence of events leading up to the\n             challenged actions, and whether there were any\n             departures from normal or substantive criteria.\n\nUnited States v. Hous. Authority of the City of Chickasaw, 504 F. Supp. 716, 727\n\n(S.D. Ala. 1980) (citing Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev.\n\n                                         13\n\fCorp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977)); see also United States v. City of Birmingham, Mich.,\n\n727 F.2d 560, 566 (6th Cir. 1984) (articulating same test). For the sake of\n\ndiscussion, we also accept that a plaintiff may demonstrate intentional\n\ndiscrimination if the “decision-making body acted for the sole purpose of\n\neffectuating the desires of private citizens, that racial considerations were a\n\nmotivating factor behind those desires, and that members of the decision-making\n\nbody were aware of the motivations of the private citizens.” United States v.\n\nYonkers, 837 F.2d 1181, 1225 (2d Cir. 1987); see also United States v. City of\n\nBlack Jack, Missouri, 508 F.2d 1179, 1185 n.3 (8th Cir. 1975); Jackson v. City of\n\nAuburn, 41 F. Supp. 2d 1300, 1311 (M.D. Ala 1999) (“If . . . a zoning board’s\n\nresponse to political pressure amounts to implementation of local residents’\n\ndiscriminatory impulses, then the board’s actions may give rise to a cause of\n\naction for intentional discrimination.”). Hallmark contends that the County\n\nimplemented the racist attitudes of community groups in its re-zoning decision. It\n\nalso argues that by applying the multi-factor test enunciated in City of Chickasaw,\n\nwe can infer that the County intentionally discriminated against African-\n\nAmericans in its re-zoning decision.\n\n      Hallmark produced evidence that the County acted for the sole purpose of\n\neffectuating the desires of the community groups and that Commissioner Edwards\n\n                                          14\n\ffelt pressured by the groups. He encouraged Hallmark to meet with the groups,\n\nand he met with the groups. Commissioner Edwards testified that he typically\n\nvotes in a manner consistent with the desires of the community groups. Hallmark\n\nalso demonstrated that some members of the community groups were motivated by\n\nracial considerations. Hallmark’s evidence showed that during its own meetings\n\nwith the community groups, racist remarks were made.\n\n      However, Hallmark failed to establish that “members of the decision-\n\nmaking body were aware of the motivations of the private citizens.” Yonkers, 837\n\nF.3d at 1225. Although Hallmark contends that Commissioner Edwards told a\n\ncommunity leader, “I know a lot of your objection to projects [like Hallmark’s]\n\nproposed development, is a black issue,” this is not sufficient to raise a triable\n\nissue of fact. This statement does not demonstrate that (1) the other members of\n\nthe Board were aware of the racist attitudes of the community leaders; (2) that\n\nCommissioner Edwards was aware that any other community leaders had racist\n\nmotivations; or (3) that despite the racist motivations of certain community\n\nleaders, the Board was not justified in denying the re-zoning based on the quality\n\nof the proposed development. See Jim Sowell Constr. Co., Inc. v. City of Coppell,\n\nTex., 61 F. Supp. 2d 542, 552 (N.D. Tex. 1999) (“The . . . evidence indicates that\n\nmany other citizens voiced their opposition to multifamily housing based on race-\n\n                                          15\n\fneutral reasons, such as the adverse impact that dense housing facilities have on\n\npublic, services, traffic, and child safety. The evidence, viewed in the aggregate,\n\nwould permit a reasonable trier of fact to find only that the allegedly-biased\n\nstatements composed but a small fraction of the opinions presented to the\n\ndecisionmaking bodies.”).\n\n      Next, Hallmark points to statements made at the hearings that it\n\ncharacterizes as “subtle” statements of bias. The statements to which it refers are\n\nobjections to the proposed price of the housing. They do not demonstrate racial\n\nanimus. They demonstrate class animus. Wealth is not a proxy for race. See\n\nJames v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 140-42 (1971); Boyd v. Lefrak Org., 509 F.2d\n\n1110, 1112-13 (2d Cir. 1975). These statements are not sufficient to overcome\n\nsummary judgment. Macone v. Town of Wakefield, 277 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(“While ambiguous remarks may, under some circumstances, help to illuminate\n\nthe summary judgment record, such remarks rarely will suffice to conceive an\n\nissue of material fact when none otherwise exists.” ) (quoting Nat’l Amusements,\n\nInc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 743-44 (1st Cir. 1995)); cf. Metropolitan\n\nHous. Dev. Corp., 558 F.2d 1283, 1292 (7th Cir. 1977) (“The bigoted comments\n\nof a few citizens, even those with power, should not invalidate action which in fact\n\nhas a legitimate basis.”).\n\n                                         16\n\f      Finally, in a footnote in its reply brief, Hallmark states that the County’s\n\nDirector of the Office of Housing, Dr. Moore, testified at trial that because the\n\narea in which the Property is located is already predominately populated by\n\nminorities, the re-zoning could have perpetuated segregation and result in\n\n“ghettotization.” Hallmark characterizes this testimony as racist. Racist or not,\n\nDr. Moore was not a decision-maker with regard to Hallmark’s re-zoning\n\napplication. Her testimony does not establish that any Board member intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against African-Americans in voting against zoning.\n\n      Applying the multi-factor test articulated in City of Chickasaw, Hallmark\n\ncontends that it has produced sufficient circumstantial evidence of discriminatory\n\nintent. The first factor is whether there is evidence of discriminatory impact. City\n\nof Chickasaw, 504 F. Supp. at 727. The testimony of Dr. Bradford, although not\n\nsufficient on this point to render the District Court’s judgment clearly erroneous\n\n(as will be discussed below), does establish discriminatory impact. See Jim\n\nSowell, 61 F. Supp. 2d at 547 n.1 (standard is lower for discriminatory impact\n\nwhen part of the discriminatory intent inquiry).\n\n      Next, with regard to the “historical background” of the zoning decision,\n\nHallmark argues that the Board ratified the community groups’ discriminatory\n\nmotives. However, there is no evidence that the Board in fact ratified the\n\n                                         17\n\fdiscriminatory motives of any community group.\n\n      With regard to the third factor, the sequence of events leading up to the\n\ndenial of the re-zoning, Hallmark points out that it was required to meet with\n\ncommunity groups repeatedly and that those groups expressed racial animus.\n\nHowever, this sequence of events is only relevant if it demonstrates that the Board\n\nratified the racial biases of those groups.\n\n      Next, Hallmark produced evidence that the Board departed from customary\n\nprocedures in ignoring the recommendations of approval from its staff and\n\nplanning bodies and in holding three hearings. Such “procedural abnormalities are\n\nonly relevant within a larger scope.” Macone, 277 F.3d at 6. Here, there is no\n\ncontext that renders this deviation suspect. The procedural departures are\n\nexplainable as a response to community concern. There is nothing inherently\n\nwrong with responding to community pressure. Here, with no racial animus\n\nexpressed to the Board, bowing to political pressure does not demonstrate racial\n\nanimus.\n\n      Hallmark also maintains that the Board departed from substantive standards\n\nin denying its application. Hallmark produced evidence that the proposed\n\ndevelopment was consistent with the uses proscribed in the County’s Land Use\n\nPlan. However, there is no evidence that the Board denied the proposed\n\n                                          18\n\fdevelopment because it had concluded it was inconsistent with the County’s Land\n\nUse Plan. Rather, the Board voted against re-zoning because Hallmark’s proposed\n\ndevelopment was unpopular with voters and was poorly designed.\n\n      Hallmark has failed to demonstrate through direct or circumstantial\n\nevidence that the Board intentionally discriminated on the basis of race in denying\n\nthe re-zoning application.\n\n                                         B\n\n      Hallmark also argues that the District Court erred in entering judgment in\n\nfavor of the County on its discriminatory impact claim. We may not set aside the\n\nDistrict Court’s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Holton v. City\n\nof Thomasville Sch. Dist., 425 F.3d 1325, 1350-51 (11th Cir. 2005). Clear error is\n\na highly deferential standard of review. Id.\n\n      “[A] showing of significant discriminatory effect suffices to demonstrate a\n\n[prima facie] violation of the Fair Housing Act.” Jackson, 21 F.3d at 1543. A\n\nplaintiff can demonstrate a discriminatory effect in two ways: it can demonstrate\n\nthat the decision has a segregative effect or that “it makes housing options\n\nsignificantly more restrictive for members of a protected group than for persons\n\noutside that group.” Hous. Investors, Inc. v. City of Clanton, Ala., 68 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1287, 1298 (M.D. Ala. 1999). In this case, Hallmark advances only the second\n\n                                         19\n\ftheory–that the re-zoning decision of the County had a harsher impact on\n\nminorities than Caucasians.\n\n      Typically, a disparate impact is demonstrated by statistics. See, e.g.,\n\nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 938 (2d Cir.\n\n1988); City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d at 1186. Although no “single test controls in\n\nmeasuring disparate impact,” Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 50\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (citing Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 995-96\n\nn.3 (1988)), certain guidelines have developed. First, it may be inappropriate to\n\nrely on “absolute numbers rather than on proportional statistics.” Huntington, 844\n\nF.2d at 938. Second, “statistics based on the general population [should] bear a\n\nproven relationship to the actual applicant flow.” Id. at 938 n.11. Third, the\n\nappropriate inquiry is into the impact on the total group to which a policy or\n\ndecision applies. Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assocs., 736 F.2d 983, 987 (4th Cir.\n\n1984).\n\n             Whether the measure of disparate impact used is\n             disproportional representation, in which the percentage\n             of minority representation in the affected group is\n             compared against that minority’s representation in the\n             general population, or disproportionate adverse impact,\n             in which the minority group’s percentage representation\n             in the affected group is compared against the majority\n             group’s representation in the affected group, the starting\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f             point is always the subset of the population that is\n             affected by the disputed decision.\n\nCity of Clanton, 68 F. Supp. at 1299.\n\n      In this case, Dr. Bradford appropriately measured the proportional impact\n\non each race and performed his analysis with regard to the group “affected by the\n\ndisputed decision.” The difficulty, however, is that the group “affected by the\n\ndisputed decision” is inherently speculative. Whether a person who currently\n\nowns a home or rents an apartment within the price ranges proposed by Hallmark\n\nfor its development would purchase or rent one of Hallmark’s homes is\n\nspeculative. This renders Dr. Bradford’s estimation of the impact on minorities\n\nsuspect. There is no evidence that the statistics based on this general population\n\nof home owners and renters bears “a proven relationship to the actual applicant\n\nflow.” See Huntington, 844 F.2d at 938 n.11; see also Macone, 277 F.3d at 8\n\n(“Here, there is no information that any minorities would actually move into the\n\nHillview Estates Project.”).\n\n      In this respect, this case is distinguishable from the majority of cases in\n\nwhich disparate impact was found. In those cases, invariably there was a waiting\n\nlist for affordable housing or a shortage of housing for which only a defined group\n\nqualified. See, e.g., Langois, 207 F.3d at 47-48 (considering those who qualify for\n\nfederally subsidized housing); Jackson, 21 F.3d at 1543 (majority of individuals\n\n                                         21\n\fon wait-list for housing were minority); Huntington, 844 F.2d at 929 (considering\n\nimpact of housing shortage on those who qualify for federally subsidized\n\nhousing); Betsey, 736 F.2d at 987 (particular individuals evicted from homes);\n\nMetropolitan Hous. Dev., 558 F.2d at 1288 (considering housing intended for\n\nthose who qualify for federal subsidies); City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d at 1186\n\n(with regard to housing intended for those within a certain income range, there\n\n“was ample proof that many blacks would live in the development”); Ass’n of\n\nRelatives and Friends of AIDS Patients v. Regulations and Permits Admin., 740 F.\n\nSupp. 95, 98 (D. P.R. 1990) (impact is on group of individuals with AIDS who\n\nwere intended to live in group home); Malone v. City of Fenton, Missouri, 592 F.\n\nSupp. 1135, 1162 (E.D. Mo. 1984) (considering only those who qualify for\n\nfederally subsidized housing). The inherent difficulty in defining the group\n\naffected by the re-zoning decision supports the District Court’s decision that Dr.\n\nBradford’s results are “inherently speculative.”\n\n      Another difficulty with Dr. Bradford’s testimony identified by the District\n\nCourt is the existence of other housing within the price range proposed by\n\nHallmark. Hallmark contends that the District Court’s conclusion on this issue\n\nwas clearly erroneous for two reasons: (1) it was based on the testimony of Mr.\n\nGary Hammond, who Hallmark contends was not qualified as an expert; and (2)\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fbecause the existence of other available housing is irrelevant.\n\n      First, the District Court’s conclusion with regard to the availability of other\n\nhousing was not based solely on the testimony of Mr. Hammond. Dr. Moore also\n\ntestified that there was adequate housing for low and moderate income residents.\n\nThe District Court did not clearly err in crediting this testimony.\n\n      Second, the availability of other housing within the relevant price ranges is\n\nrelevant to the accuracy of Dr. Bradford’s statistics. If there is a glut in the market\n\nof homes in Hallmark’s projected price range, the lack of the Hallmark’s particular\n\ndevelopment is not likely to have an impact on anyone, let alone adversely affect\n\none group disproportionately. As explained above, adverse impact is consistently\n\nfound when there is a housing shortage. See, e.g., Metropolitan Hous. Dev., 558\n\nF.2d at 1288 (noting that decision not to re-zone land for public housing precluded\n\npublic housing in that area unless other land were zoned). It stands to reason that\n\nthe impact of a failure to build particular housing may be measured more\n\naccurately when no other housing is available.\n\n      Hallmark argues that the District Court erred in considering whether\n\nhousing was available at the time the Board denied its re-zoning application\n\nbecause the area in which the Property is located is expected to grow population-\n\nwise over the next ten to fifteen years. Hallmark contends that housing\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fopportunities for minorities will be denied in the future if affordable housing is not\n\nbuilt. Hallmark cites no authority for the proposition that this Court should\n\nconsider whether there will be an impact in the future on minorities, as opposed to\n\nwhether there was an impact at the time of the zoning decision. Additionally,\n\nHallmark’s argument is speculative. It cannot be determined what type of housing\n\nwill be built in the future or what the price of that housing will be.\n\n      Hallmark asserts that “blocking these units from being built . . . denies these\n\nminority households the opportunity and advantage of increased housing choices\n\nand supply.” It contends that by looking at the existence of other housing when\n\nthis particular housing was denied is like saying that even if one lunch counter is\n\n“whites only,” there is no harm if other lunch counters are available. However,\n\n             there is no federally protected right to housing in a\n             particular community, an allegation which lies at the\n             essence of plaintiff’s action. . . . Plaintiffs are not\n             prevented from obtaining all housing in the [South\n             Fulton] community as a result of [the decision not to re-\n             zone].\n\nSchmidt v. Boston Hous. Auth., 505 F. Supp. 988, 995-96 (D. Mass. 1981)\n\n(emphasis added). Nor does Hallmark cite any authority for the proposition that\n\nan individual has a right to “increased housing choices and supply.” Where such a\n\nright would end, Hallmark does not explain. Recognizing a right to “increased\n\nhousing choices and supply” would effectively place an affirmative duty on\n\n                                          24\n\fgoverning bodies to approve all re-zoning applications wherein a developer sought\n\nto build housing within a particular price range. Furthermore, Hallmark’s lunch\n\ncounter analogy is flawed. Here, there is no evidence that South Fulton is\n\ncurrently segregated and that Hallmark’s development would end that segregation.\n\nTherefore, there is no “segregated lunch counter” that the County is refusing to\n\nremedy. The District Court did not clearly err in finding that other affordable\n\nhousing is available. This finding cuts against the accuracy of Dr. Bradford’s\n\nopinion.\n\n      The District Court also rejected Dr. Bradford’s testimony on the grounds\n\nthat Hallmark’s projected price ranges may not be the price at which the homes\n\nactually sell and the apartments actually rent. Hallmark argues correctly that the\n\nDistrict Court’s finding on this issue was partly speculative. Hallmark failed to\n\nmeet its burden of demonstrating that the houses would actually sell and the\n\napartments and townhomes would actually rent for the prices projected.\n\n      The District Court did not clearly err in refusing to credit the testimony of\n\nDr. Bradford. We need not reach the issue of whether the District Court clearly\n\nerred in concluding that Dr. Bradford’s testimony failed to establish that the\n\ndisparity ratios were statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\f                                         C\n\n      Hallmark challenges the District Court’s decision to admit the testimony of\n\nMr. Hammond. A decision to admit or exclude an expert’s testimony is reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion. Cortes v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 177 F.3d 1272, 1305-06 (11th\n\nCir. 1999). Hallmark argues that the District Court erred in failing to hold a\n\nDaubert hearing regarding Mr. Hammond’s testimony and that Mr. Hammond’s\n\ntestimony was based on flawed methodology. We do not reach this issue because\n\nthe District Court’s judgment does not depend on the admissibility of Mr.\n\nHammond’s testimony.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\f",

Alarcün, United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit, sitting\nby designation.\n\f                                          I\n\n      Appellants Hallmark Developers, Inc. and Charles Garrison (collectively,\n\n“Hallmark”) appeal from (1) the summary judgment in favor of Appellee Fulton\n\nCounty, Georgia (“the County”) on their intentional discrimination claim based on\n\nthe Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq. (“FHA”); and (2) the judgment\n\nentered following a bench trial on the merits on their discriminatory impact claim\n\nbased on the FHA.\n\n      The District Court concluded that Hallmark had failed to adduce evidence\n\nthat the County had intentionally discriminated on the basis of race when it\n\nrefused to re-zone a parcel of property in order for Hallmark to build, inter alia,\n\nhomes affordable to households with low and moderate incomes. The District\n\nCourt also concluded that Hallmark failed to demonstrate that the re-zoning\n\ndecision had a significant disparate impact on minorities. Hallmark argues that (1)\n\nthe District Court failed to consider relevant evidence of discriminatory intent; (2)\n\nwas clearly in error in its finding regarding disparate impact; and (3) considered\n\nexpert testimony that should have been excluded under Rule 702 of the Federal\n\nRules of Evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                                             II\n\n       For many years, Chris Doughtie, president of Hallmark, received literature\n\nand invitations to attend business functions in South Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nThis literature identified South Fulton County as a “development target and\n\nadvised developers of the incentives to encourage development in the corridor.”\n\n       Accordingly, Hallmark and Appellant Charles Garrison acquired property in\n\nSouth Fulton County (“the Property”) with the express intention of developing it\n\nfor a mixture of uses, including commercial, office, and residential. Specifically,\n\nthey hoped to construct a large development consisting of apartments, townhomes\n\nsingle-family homes, and office space. The townhomes and single-family homes\n\nwould be built under the control of Hallmark. The apartments would be built by a\n\ncontractor subject to conditions imposed by Hallmark. Hallmark intended that a\n\nlarge percentage of the homes would be “affordable,” as defined by the\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).1 The Property would\n\nhave to be re-zoned from AG-1 (agricultural) to MIX (mixed use) in order for this\n\ndevelopment to take place.\n\n       In early 2001, Mr. Doughtie arranged for a visit to Chestnut Lake, a low-\n\n\n       1\n        Under HUD definitions, housing is “affordable” if a person making 80% of the annual\nmedian income for a given geographical area pays 30% or less of gross monthly income for\nmortgage and utilities or rent and utilities. See 24 C.F.R. §§ 92.2, 92.252, 92.254.\n\n                                              3\n\fincome, single-family subdivision that Hallmark had developed in DeKalb\n\nCounty, Georgia. Among others, he invited Fulton County Commissioner William\n\nEdwards, Fulton County Assistant Director of Comprehensive Planning Beth\n\nMcMillan, and Fulton County Economic Development Director Joseph Johnson.\n\nThe purpose of the visit was to acquaint these county officials with the sort of\n\ndevelopment Hallmark intended to make on the Property.\n\n       Chestnut Lake contains 700 lots. The homes initially were priced in the\n\nrange of $89,000 to $130,000, but after changes were made, the price range was\n\nfrom approximately $120,000 to $150,000. The homes were built by Mayfield\n\nHomes, which is owned in part by Mr. Doughtie and his son. Mr. Doughtie told\n\nthe county officials that Mayfield Homes would build the single-family homes on\n\nthe Property as well, and that the homes on the Property would be similar in\n\nappearance and layout to those at Chestnut Lake.\n\n       During this visit, none of the county officials expressed any concern\n\nregarding the quality of the Chestnut Lake development.2 Commissioner Edwards,\n\nhowever, cautioned Mr. Doughtie to involve South Fulton community associations\n\n\n       2\n        In its order on summary judgment, the District Court stated that it was undisputed that no\nconcerns regarding quality were expressed. At trial, Commissioner Edwards testified that he had\nconcerns over the quality of the homes. He felt, among other things, that they were “very\ngeneric,” had very small rooms, and “just looked like row houses.” It is not clear whether he\nexpressed these concerns to Mr. Doughtie.\n\n                                                4\n\fin the re-zoning process to “get the community happy.” Among the community\n\ngroups Commissioner Edwards listed were the South Fulton Parkway Alliance, the\n\nCliffondale Community Association, and Green South Fulton (“the community\n\ngroups”).\n\n      On October 30, 2001, Hallmark filed an application with the Fulton County\n\nDepartment of Environment and Community Development seeking to re-zone the\n\nProperty. Kathryn Zickert appeared before the Board of Commissioners (“the\n\nBoard”) on behalf of Hallmark at a public hearing on February 6, 2002. The\n\nBoard granted a 60-day deferral to allow Hallmark to engage in discussions with\n\nthe community groups regarding the proposed development.\n\n      On April 3, 2002, Ms. Zickert appeared before the Board on behalf of\n\nHallmark a second time. After the public hearing, Commissioner Edwards (who is\n\ncommissioner of the district where the Property is located) moved to deny\n\nHallmark’s re-zoning application “based on the quality of what [he’d] seen and\n\nthings [he’d] heard.” Chairman Mike Kenn supported Commissioner Edwards’s\n\nmotion. He stated that the development was “probably one of the poorest-\n\ndesigned, laid out subdivisions [he’d] ever seen.” Another commissioner made a\n\nsubstitute motion for an additional 60-day deferral, and the Board granted the\n\ndeferral so that Hallmark could continue to discuss unresolved issues with the\n\n                                         5\n\fcommunity groups.\n\n      On June 5, 2002, Ms. Zickert appeared before the Board on behalf of\n\nHallmark a third and final time. Commissioner Edwards moved to deny the\n\napplication due to the lack of improvement “in terms of the quality of the site plan\n\nand the site plan design.” Hallmark’s re-zoning application was denied.\n\n      While Hallmark’s application for re-zoning was pending, Mr. Doughtie, his\n\ncolleagues, and his attorneys met with the community groups as suggested by\n\nCommissioner Edwards. During the meetings, community group members\n\nexpressed opposition to the proposed development on the Property. Three\n\ncommunity leaders, Abby Jordan, Dave Robinson, and Larry Hyde stated that they\n\nopposed the proposed development because it was likely to attract “blacks” and\n\nfamilies with children to the area. Another community activist, Bruce Moody,\n\nstated that he did not want poor black people moving into low-rent, lower priced\n\nhomes in South Fulton County.\n\n      On January 26, 2001, at a meeting with a community group, Hallmark’s\n\ncounsel heard Commissioner Edwards say to Ms. Jordan, “I know a lot of your\n\nobjections to projects like [Hallmark’s] proposed development, is a black issue.”\n\nThe community groups also objected to the quality of the proposed homes, “made\n\ndemands which drove up the prices of homes,” and “did not want apartments in\n\n                                         6\n\fanything but luxury form.” Hallmark agreed to many of the changes in the quality\n\nof the development that the community groups suggested.\n\n       Hallmark did not produce evidence that any racist remarks were made at the\n\nhearings in front of the Board. Although Hallmark contends that “subtle remarks\n\nwere made by no fewer than three activists” to the Board at the second hearing on\n\nApril 3, 2002, Hallmark does not state exactly what the remarks were.3 The\n\nCounty points out that one member of the community stated:\n\n              What I’m saying is that we have no choices that are over\n              [$150,000, with reference to the price of the homes].\n              And what I’m trying to get at is if we just keep building\n              houses that are all under 150, we will never raise the bar\n              in South Fulton. We will never bring in the kind of\n              development that I thought this Commission envisioned.\n\nThe same community member later referred to the “apartment challenge” and “the\n\ntransient part of that.” Commissioner Emma Darnell responded:\n\n              That’s a bad argument to bring to me. Let the approach\n              have something to do with some objective measurement\n              of the quality of life. Talk to me about environment.\n              Talk to me about traffic. Let’s not bring our personal\n              aesthetic prejudices and biases to the table . . . this\n              County Commission is not going to close its doors to\n              ordinary working people who also want to live and have\n              nice houses.\n\n\n\n       3\n       The gist of the statements appears to be that the community members wanted the\ndevelopment to be more upscale.\n\n                                             7\n\fCommissioner Nancy Boxill stated: “I don’t want to participate in a zoning\n\nprocess that starts to say what kind of person gets to live where.” Commissioner\n\nEdwards stated:\n\n             Let me just add, too, because I want to thank both my\n             colleagues for bringing out a very good point and a\n             sensitive point because you understand my motion [to\n             deny the re-zoning application] has nothing to do with\n             price. . . But we do talk about price and a lot of times I\n             think we should change that to quality and other things.\n             And that was the basis of my denial.\n\nAnother community member said something about keeping South Fulton Parkway\n\n“pristine.” Commissioner Boxill stated that the community members were\n\ndescribing a “redlining” practice.\n\n      The County’s Planning Staff, Community Zoning Board, the Atlanta\n\nRegional Commission, and the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority\n\nreviewed and repeatedly recommended approval for Hallmark’s zoning\n\napplication. Nevertheless, Commissioner Edwards voted to deny the re-zoning.\n\nHe was apparently influenced by the opposition of the community groups in this\n\ndecision. He stated in his deposition that ninety percent of the zonings that\n\nhappen in South Fulton County are “done real simple between the community and\n\nthe developer.” Zoning applications opposed by such community groups are\n\nusually not approved. Actual voting records confirm that in eighty-nine of ninety-\n\n                                          8\n\ffive instances, Commissioner Edwards’s vote reflected the community’s position.\n\nTypically, other commissioners show “district courtesy” to each other. If a\n\nproposed project is located within one commissioner’s district, the other\n\ncommissioners defer to that commissioner’s wishes.\n\n      Following the denial of its application, Hallmark filed a complaint under the\n\nFHA, contending that the County discriminated on the basis of race in denying its\n\napplication. Hallmark alleged that in giving effect to the racist views of the\n\ncommunity groups, the County acted with intent to discriminate. It also alleged\n\nthat the denial of the re-zoning worked a disparate impact on African-Americans,\n\nwho were more likely to be the purchasers of the homes and renters of the\n\napartments and townhomes on the Property. The District Court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the County with regard to the intentional discrimination\n\nclaim. It concluded that there was no evidence that the County was aware of the\n\nracist views of the community members. It denied the motion for summary\n\njudgment with regard to the disparate impact claim.\n\n      At trial, Hallmark produced an expert witness, Dr. Bradford, who testified\n\nthat the re-zoning decision had a disparate impact on minorities. Specifically, he\n\ntestified that “the elimination of either for sale or rental housing in the lower cost\n\nranges of the proposal for the Hallmark development would disproportionately and\n\n                                           9\n\fadversely affect minority households as compared to white households.” He\n\ncalculated disparity ratios4 based on an assumption that persons who owned homes\n\nor rented apartments in certain “value ranges” in particular geographical areas\n\nwere representative of those who would have purchased or rented homes on the\n\nProperty. Using data from the 2000 United States Census, Dr. Bradford examined\n\nthe race of each homeowner or renter, the individual’s estimate of the value of his\n\nor her home or the amount of rent, and the address of the residence. He examined\n\nthis data in five geographical areas, of increasing size, that surround the Property:\n\n(1) the area within a 10-mile radius of the Property; (2) the area within a 20-mile\n\nradius of the Property; (3) the area within a 30-mile radius of the Property; (4) the\n\n30-mile radius from central Atlanta; and (5) the 20 counties surrounding Atlanta.\n\nHe opined that the 30-mile radius from central Atlanta and the 20-county area\n\nwould be the most reliable indicator of the race of the likely owners or renters on\n\nthe Property.\n\n       Based on the disparity ratios he calculated, Dr. Bradford concluded that\n\nthere would be a statistically significant disparate racial impact arising from the\n\n\n       4\n         A “disparity ratio” is arrived at by dividing the percentage of all minority households\nliving in a certain value or rent range by the percentage of all white households living in that\nsame value or rent range. The underlying percentages are arrived at by dividing, for each racial\ngroup, the total number of households within one value or rent range by the total number of\nhouseholds within all values or rent ranges.\n\n                                               10\n\fdenial of the re-zoning due to the elimination of homes priced below $125,000 and\n\nrental housing costing less than $750 per month.\n\n      The County produced an expert who testified that there is an oversupply of\n\nhousing within the price ranges Dr. Bradford testified were relevant to the\n\ndisparate impact on minorities. Dr. Camilla Johnson Moore, Director of the\n\nFulton County Office of Housing testified that at the time Hallmark’s re-zoning\n\napplication was denied, there was adequate housing for low and moderate income\n\nresidents. She testified there was an “oversaturation.” The District Court credited\n\nthis testimony. It concluded because other housing was available within the price\n\nranges that would allegedly produce the disparate impact, there was no appreciable\n\nimpact on minorities caused by the lack of the particular development Hallmark\n\nwished to construct.\n\n      The District Court also concluded that the impact to which Dr. Bradford\n\ntestified was not significant. In terms of pure percentages (as opposed to disparity\n\nratios), black home purchasers and renters occupied only a slightly larger\n\npercentage of the market than Caucasians in the relevant price ranges.\n\n      Finally, the District Court concluded that Dr. Bradford’s testimony was\n\ninherently speculative. His calculations related to an estimated, hypothetical\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fgroup of individuals.5 Additionally, the District Court found that there was no\n\nguarantee that any of the homes or apartments, if built, would be priced as\n\nHallmark intended. In the Chestnut Lake development, the homes sold for a\n\nhigher price than originally intended. The apartments were not to be built by\n\nHallmark, but by a contractor. Because Dr. Bradford’s opinion regarding\n\ndisparate impact was based on a specific price range, any potential changes in the\n\nprices at which the homes actually sold or the apartments actually rented would\n\naffect the validity of Dr. Bradford’s opinion.\n\n       Having concluded that Dr. Bradford’s testimony failed to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of disparate impact, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the\n\nCounty. Hallmark has timely appealed.\n\n                                              III\n\n                                               A\n\n       Hallmark argues that the District Court erred in entering summary judgment\n\non its claim of intentional discrimination. The District Court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment is reviewed de novo.

Hallmark contends that the County\n\nimplemented the racist attitudes of community groups in its re-zoning decision. It\n\nalso argues that by applying the multi-factor test enunciated in City of Chickasaw,\n\nwe can infer that the County intentionally discriminated against African-\n\nAmericans in its re-zoning decision.\n\n      Hallmark produced evidence that the County acted for the sole purpose of\n\neffectuating the desires of the community groups and that Commissioner Edwards\n\n                                          14\n\ffelt pressured by the groups.

Racist or not,\n\nDr. Moore was not a decision-maker with regard to Hallmark’s re-zoning\n\napplication. Her testimony does not establish that any Board member intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against African-Americans in voting against zoning.\n\n      Applying the multi-factor test articulated in City of Chickasaw, Hallmark\n\ncontends that it has produced sufficient circumstantial evidence of discriminatory\n\nintent. The first factor is whether there is evidence of discriminatory impact. City\n\nof Chickasaw, 504 F. Supp. at 727. The testimony of Dr. Bradford, although not\n\nsufficient on this point to render the District Court’s judgment clearly erroneous\n\n(as will be discussed below), does establish discriminatory impact.

However, there is no evidence that the Board in fact ratified the\n\n                                         17\n\fdiscriminatory motives of any community group.\n\n      With regard to the third factor, the sequence of events leading up to the\n\ndenial of the re-zoning, Hallmark points out that it was required to meet with\n\ncommunity groups repeatedly and that those groups expressed racial animus.\n\nHowever, this sequence of events is only relevant if it demonstrates that the Board\n\nratified the racial biases of those groups.\n\n      Next, Hallmark produced evidence that the Board departed from customary\n\nprocedures in ignoring the recommendations of approval from its staff and\n\nplanning bodies and in holding three hearings. Such “procedural abnormalities are\n\nonly relevant within a larger scope.” Macone, 277 F.3d at 6. Here, there is no\n\ncontext that renders this deviation suspect. The procedural departures are\n\nexplainable as a response to community concern. There is nothing inherently\n\nwrong with responding to community pressure. Here, with no racial animus\n\nexpressed to the Board, bowing to political pressure does not demonstrate racial\n\nanimus.\n\n      Hallmark also maintains that the Board departed from substantive standards\n\nin denying its application. Hallmark produced evidence that the proposed\n\ndevelopment was consistent with the uses proscribed in the County’s Land Use\n\nPlan. However, there is no evidence that the Board denied the proposed\n\n                                          18\n\fdevelopment because it had concluded it was inconsistent with the County’s Land\n\nUse Plan. Rather, the Board voted against re-zoning because Hallmark’s proposed\n\ndevelopment was unpopular with voters and was poorly designed.\n\n      Hallmark has failed to demonstrate through direct or circumstantial\n\nevidence that the Board intentionally discriminated on the basis of race in denying\n\nthe re-zoning application.\n\n                                         B\n\n      Hallmark also argues that the District Court erred in entering judgment in\n\nfavor of the County on its discriminatory impact claim. We may not set aside the\n\nDistrict Court’s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Holton v. City\n\nof Thomasville Sch.

Supp. at 1299.\n\n      In this case, Dr. Bradford appropriately measured the proportional impact\n\non each race and performed his analysis with regard to the group “affected by the\n\ndisputed decision.” The difficulty, however, is that the group “affected by the\n\ndisputed decision” is inherently speculative. Whether a person who currently\n\nowns a home or rents an apartment within the price ranges proposed by Hallmark\n\nfor its development would purchase or rent one of Hallmark’s homes is\n\nspeculative. This renders Dr. Bradford’s estimation of the impact on minorities\n\nsuspect. There is no evidence that the statistics based on this general population\n\nof home owners and renters bears “a proven relationship to the actual applicant\n\nflow.” See Huntington, 844 F.2d at 938 n.11; see also Macone, 277 F.3d at 8\n\n(“Here, there is no information that any minorities would actually move into the\n\nHillview Estates Project.”).\n\n      In this respect, this case is distinguishable from the majority of cases in\n\nwhich disparate impact was found. In those cases, invariably there was a waiting\n\nlist for affordable housing or a shortage of housing for which only a defined group\n\nqualified. See, e.g., Langois, 207 F.3d at 47-48 (considering those who qualify for\n\nfederally subsidized housing); Jackson, 21 F.3d at 1543 (majority of individuals\n\n                                         21\n\fon wait-list for housing were minority); Huntington, 844 F.2d at 929 (considering\n\nimpact of housing shortage on those who qualify for federally subsidized\n\nhousing); Betsey, 736 F.2d at 987 (particular individuals evicted from homes);\n\nMetropolitan Hous. Dev., 558 F.2d at 1288 (considering housing intended for\n\nthose who qualify for federal subsidies); City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d at 1186\n\n(with regard to housing intended for those within a certain income range, there\n\n“was ample proof that many blacks would live in the development”); Ass’n of\n\nRelatives and Friends of AIDS Patients v. Regulations and Permits Admin., 740 F.\n\nSupp. 95, 98 (D. P.R. 1990) (impact is on group of individuals with AIDS who\n\nwere intended to live in group home); Malone v. City of Fenton, Missouri, 592 F.\n\nSupp. 1135, 1162 (E.D. Mo. 1984) (considering only those who qualify for\n\nfederally subsidized housing). The inherent difficulty in defining the group\n\naffected by the re-zoning decision supports the District Court’s decision that Dr.\n\nBradford’s results are “inherently speculative.”\n\n      Another difficulty with Dr. Bradford’s testimony identified by the District\n\nCourt is the existence of other housing within the price range proposed by\n\nHallmark. Hallmark contends that the District Court’s conclusion on this issue\n\nwas clearly erroneous for two reasons: (1) it was based on the testimony of Mr.\n\nGary Hammond, who Hallmark contends was not qualified as an expert; and (2)\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fbecause the existence of other available housing is irrelevant.\n\n      First, the District Court’s conclusion with regard to the availability of other\n\nhousing was not based solely on the testimony of Mr. Hammond. Dr. Moore also\n\ntestified that there was adequate housing for low and moderate income residents.\n\nThe District Court did not clearly err in crediting this testimony.\n\n      Second, the availability of other housing within the relevant price ranges is\n\nrelevant to the accuracy of Dr. Bradford’s statistics. If there is a glut in the market\n\nof homes in Hallmark’s projected price range, the lack of the Hallmark’s particular\n\ndevelopment is not likely to have an impact on anyone, let alone adversely affect\n\none group disproportionately. As explained above, adverse impact is consistently\n\nfound when there is a housing shortage. See, e.g., Metropolitan Hous. Dev., 558\n\nF.2d at 1288 (noting that decision not to re-zone land for public housing precluded\n\npublic housing in that area unless other land were zoned). It stands to reason that\n\nthe impact of a failure to build particular housing may be measured more\n\naccurately when no other housing is available.\n\n      Hallmark argues that the District Court erred in considering whether\n\nhousing was available at the time the Board denied its re-zoning application\n\nbecause the area in which the Property is located is expected to grow population-\n\nwise over the next ten to fifteen years. Hallmark contends that housing\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fopportunities for minorities will be denied in the future if affordable housing is not\n\nbuilt. Hallmark cites no authority for the proposition that this Court should\n\nconsider whether there will be an impact in the future on minorities, as opposed to\n\nwhether there was an impact at the time of the zoning decision. Additionally,\n\nHallmark’s argument is speculative. It cannot be determined what type of housing\n\nwill be built in the future or what the price of that housing will be.\n\n      Hallmark asserts that “blocking these units from being built . . . denies these\n\nminority households the opportunity and advantage of increased housing choices\n\nand supply.” It contends that by looking at the existence of other housing when\n\nthis particular housing was denied is like saying that even if one lunch counter is\n\n“whites only,” there is no harm if other lunch counters are available. However,\n\n             there is no federally protected right to housing in a\n             particular community, an allegation which lies at the\n             essence of plaintiff’s action. . . . Plaintiffs are not\n             prevented from obtaining all housing in the [South\n             Fulton] community as a result of [the decision not to re-\n             zone].\n\nSchmidt v. Boston Hous. Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1950805\"><a href=\"/opinion/1950805/schmidt-v-boston-housing-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 995-96 (D. Mass. 1981)\n\n(emphasis added). Nor does Hallmark cite any authority for the proposition that\n\nan individual has a right to “increased housing choices and supply.” Where such a\n\nright would end, Hallmark does not explain. Recognizing a right to “increased\n\nhousing choices and supply” would effectively place an affirmative duty on\n\n                                          24\n\fgoverning bodies to approve all re-zoning applications wherein a developer sought\n\nto build housing within a particular price range. Furthermore, Hallmark’s lunch\n\ncounter analogy is flawed. Here, there is no evidence that South Fulton is\n\ncurrently segregated and that Hallmark’s development would end that segregation.\n\nTherefore, there is no “segregated lunch counter” that the County is refusing to\n\nremedy. The District Court did not clearly err in finding that other affordable\n\nhousing is available. This finding cuts against the accuracy of Dr. Bradford’s\n\nopinion.\n\n      The District Court also rejected Dr. Bradford’s testimony on the grounds\n\nthat Hallmark’s projected price ranges may not be the price at which the homes\n\nactually sell and the apartments actually rent. Hallmark argues correctly that the\n\nDistrict Court’s finding on this issue was partly speculative. Hallmark failed to\n\nmeet its burden of demonstrating that the houses would actually sell and the\n\napartments and townhomes would actually rent for the prices projected.\n\n      The District Court did not clearly err in refusing to credit the testimony of\n\nDr. Bradford. We need not reach the issue of whether the District Court clearly\n\nerred in concluding that Dr. Bradford’s testimony failed to establish that the\n\ndisparity ratios were statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\f                                         C\n\n      Hallmark challenges the District Court’s decision to admit the testimony of\n\nMr. Hammond. A decision to admit or exclude an expert’s testimony is reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion. Cortes v. Am.

Hallmark argues that the District Court erred in failing to hold a\n\nDaubert hearing regarding Mr. Hammond’s testimony and that Mr. Hammond’s\n\ntestimony was based on flawed methodology. We do not reach this issue because\n\nthe District Court’s judgment does not depend on the admissibility of Mr.\n\nHammond’s testimony.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\f</pre>",
