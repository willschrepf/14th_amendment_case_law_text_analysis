Twenty white students and two minority students live in Forest Springs, which is\r\ncurrently within the Goodrich I.S.D. boundary.  Thirteen of these students have been attending\r\nLivingston schools without officially transferring to the school district.  In 1987, the Texas\r\nEducation Agency (\"TEA\") refused the requests of several Forest Springs students to transfer to\r\nLivingston I.S.D., explaining that the transfers violated Civil Order No. 5281 of the U.S. District\r\nCourt of the Eastern District of Texas as modified (the \"federal order\").<strong><sup> (1)</sup></strong></span><span>  The record is unclear\r\nas to which, if any, of the thirteen Forest Springs students unofficially attending Livingston I.S.D.\r\nwere the students whose transfer requests were denied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 1991, after Livingston discovered the students' unofficial attendance and\r\nthreatened to charge them tuition, the Forest Springs subdivision sought detachment from\r\nGoodrich and annexation to Livingston.  The Livingston I.S.D. Board of Trustees approved\r\nForest Springs' proposed annexation, but the Goodrich I.S.D. Board of Trustees denied the\r\ndetachment request.  Forest Springs appealed Goodrich's decision to the Commissioner of\r\nEducation.  <em>See</em> Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §§ 11.13, 19.022(i) (West 1991).  Section 19.022(i)\r\nprovides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>If the board of trustees for either affected district disapproves the petition, an\r\naggrieved party to the proceedings in either district may appeal the board's\r\ndecision to the commissioner of education under Section 11.13 of this code.  An\r\nappeal under this subsection is de novo.  In deciding this appeal, the commissioner\r\nshall consider the educational interests of the students in the affected territory and\r\nthe affected districts and the social, economic, and educational effects of the\r\nproposed boundary change.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 19.022(i) (West 1991).  Before the Commissioner's hearing on January\r\n6, 1992, the parties stipulated that the proposed annexation would have \"no substantial adverse\r\neducational, social, or economic effects to the students or to the school districts involved in this\r\ndispute,\" unless the Commissioner found that the annexation violated the federal order. \r\nPresumably, then, violation of the federal order was the sole educational effect the Commissioner\r\nwas to consider.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith regard to boundary changes, the federal order directs the TEA and the\r\nCommissioner of Education not to:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>permit, make arrangements for, approve, acquiesce in, or give support of any kind\r\nto changes in school boundary lineswhether by detachment, annexation, or\r\nconsolidation of districts in whole or in partwhich are designed to, or do in fact,\r\ncreate, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on\r\nrace, color, or national origin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>See United States v.

Supp. 1043 (E.D. Tex. 1970) and 330 F. Supp. 235 (E.D. Tex. 1971)).  In sum, therefore,\r\nthe parties stipulated that the Commissioner's sole role was to investigate the effect of the\r\nproposed boundary change on the segregated status of the two school districts to determine if the\r\nannexation would violate the \"dual school system\" provision of the federal order.<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn support of his decision allowing Forest Springs' detachment and annexation, the\r\nCommissioner made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span>Findings of Fact</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>12.\t[Forest Springs'] detachment from Goodrich I.S.D. <span>will</span> <span>not</span> result in racial\r\nimbalance; however, it does change the majority and minority percentage of\r\n[Goodrich I.S.D.'s] school population, based on average daily attendance,\r\nby more than one percent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>14.\tThere is no evidence that the detachment of Petitioner Forest Springs\r\nSubdivision from Respondent Goodrich I.S.D. is designed to or does in fact,\r\ncreate, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based\r\non race, color, or national origin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>15.\tThere is no evidence that the annexation of Petitioner Forest Springs\r\nSubdivision from Respondent Livingston I.S.D. is designed to or does in\r\nfact, create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system\r\nbased on race, color, or national origin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><span>Conclusions of Law</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span> 2.\tThe change of boundaries resulting from detachment of the affected territory\r\nfrom Respondent Goodrich I.S.D. and the annexation of Forest Springs\r\nSubdivision, Petitioner, to Livingston I.S.D. does not violate Federal Civil\r\nAction No. 5281.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span> 3.\tDetachment of the affected territory from Respondent and annexation of that\r\nterritory to Livingston I.S.D. will have no significant adverse educational,\r\neconomic, or social effect on the school districts or students involved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The district court reversed the Commissioner's decision and held that, considering all the\r\nevidence, the Commissioner could only have concluded that Forest Springs' detachment and\r\nannexation would foster a segregated system of education.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>                    <center><strong>THE ISSUE</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the parties have defined their dispute in terms of violation of the federal\r\norder, this Court does not sit to interpret and collaterally enforce a federal order.  <em>See Prosper\r\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Central Educ. Agency</em>, 798 S.W.2d 661, 665 (Tex. App.--Austin 1990, writ\r\ndenied).  Instead, our review is governed by section 2001.174(2)(E) of the Administrative\r\nProcedure Act (\"APA\"), under which we review for substantial evidence questions committed to\r\nthe agency's discretion and challenged by the parties on appeal.  <em>See</em> Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\r\n2001.174 (West 1995).  By stipulation the parties agreed that the creation, maintenance,\r\nreinforcement, renewal, or encouragement of a dual school system in violation of the federal order\r\nwas the only educational effect of sufficient gravity to preclude Forest Springs' annexation to\r\nLivingston.  Therefore, the issue before us is whether the Commissioner's decision to allow the\r\nannexation of Forest Springs to Livingston I.S.D. is supported by substantial evidence that such\r\nboundary change would not create, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system\r\nbased on race, color, or national origin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE REVIEW</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe TEA and Forest Springs allege that because the Commissioner's decision is\r\nsupported by substantial evidence, the district court's judgment must be reversed.  In conducting\r\na substantial evidence review, we determine whether the evidence as a whole is such that\r\nreasonable minds could have reached the same conclusion as the agency in the disputed action. \r\n<em>Texas State Bd. of Dental Examiners v. Sizemore</em>, 759 S.W.2d 114, 116 (Tex. 1988); <em>Texas\r\nHealth Facilities Comm'n v. Charter Medical-Dallas, Inc.</em>, 665 S.W.2d 446, 453 (Tex. 1984). \r\nWe may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency and may only consider the record on\r\nwhich the agency based its decision.  <em>Sizemore</em>, 759 S.W.2d at 116.  The appealing party bears\r\nthe burden of showing a lack of substantial evidence and cannot meet this burden merely by\r\nshowing that the evidence preponderates against the agency decision.  <em>Charter Medical</em>, 665\r\nS.W.2d at 452-53.  When there is substantial evidence which would support either affirmative or\r\nnegative findings, the order will be upheld even though the Commissioner arrived at a decision\r\ncontrary to that which the reviewing court might have reached.  <em>Auto Convoy Co. v. Railroad\r\nComm'n</em>, 507 S.W.2d 718, 722 (Tex. 1974).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></center>\r\n\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAn expert from the TEA, four parents of Forest Springs students, the\r\nsuperintendents from both the Livingston and Goodrich school districts, and a principal and\r\nteacher from Goodrich testified at the Commissioner's hearing.  Dr. Robert Alexius, executive\r\nassistant to the Deputy Commissioner for Accountability at the TEA, investigated the proposed\r\nboundary change.  Alexius emphasized at the hearing that he merely provides the Commissioner\r\nwith numerical data regarding the racial composition of the affected schools and the anticipated\r\nracial change in the districts.  Alexius testified that Goodrich I.S.D. would be 60.1% white if all\r\nchildren from Forest Springs were properly enrolled in Goodrich I.S.D.  Livingston I.S.D. is\r\n80% white.  Alexius concluded that if Forest Springs' annexation were allowed, the white student\r\npopulation in Goodrich I.S.D. would decrease by 2.5 percent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlexius also explained that the TEA uses the federal order's one-percent transfer\r\nrule as a guideline in approving proposed boundary changes and that a boundary change which\r\nresults in a one-percent change in racial composition raises a red flag for possible violation of the\r\nfederal order.  However, he stressed that these statistics were only one factor in the\r\nCommissioner's analysis of whether the proposed change would violate the federal modified\r\norder.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth parties spent a significant amount of time in their briefs and at oral argument\r\ndiscussing the one-percent transfer rule.  However, under the terms of the federal order, the one-percent rule applies only to the analysis of transfer requests; the section governing boundary\r\nchanges was never amended and does not include a one-percent benchmark.<strong><sup> (3)</sup></strong></span><span>  Due to their scope,\r\nboundary changes have broader social, economic, and educational ramifications than individual\r\nstudent transfers and are poorly suited to determination through application of a rote mathematical\r\nformula.  Although we do not pass on the propriety of the TEA's use of the one-percent rule in\r\nanalyzing boundary change requests, it appears that the Commissioner, if he considers the one-percent transfer rule in boundary changes at all, should use this quantitative piece of evidence as\r\nonly one factor in assaying the broad, qualitative impact of a boundary change.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven the federal court that issued the order has noted that the one-percent rule\r\nshould not be applied rigidly.  In a subsequent modification to its original order, the court stressed\r\nthat, regardless of the percentage change in racial composition, the fact that the schools remain\r\nintegrated is an important factor in assessing proposed transfer requests.  <em>See United States v.\r\nState of Tex.</em>, Order Interpreting Modified Order of July 13, 1971 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 8, 1980)\r\n(unpublished).<strong><sup> (4)</sup></strong></span><span>  The same holds true in evaluating the segregative effect of a boundary change. \r\nEvidence was presented that both the Goodrich and Livingston school districts operate as unitary\r\nschool systems,<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong></span><span> are not operating under any court desegregation orders, and enjoy good\r\ninterracial relations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRegardless of the applicability of the one-percent rule, Goodrich maintains that\r\nForest Springs' detachment would precipitate defection to Livingston of other white\r\nneighborhoods currently within its boundary.  Goodrich presented a significant amount of\r\nevidence that the proposed boundary change would affect it negatively, as witnessed by the\r\nCommissioner's statement that \"the evidence presented barely shows . . . that detachment and\r\nannexation is in the best educational as well as the best social interests of the students in the\r\naffected territory.\"  However, some of this evidence related only to economic issues, such as the\r\ndistrict's loss of tax revenues, state funds and resulting budget problems, or the \"status\" of\r\nGoodrich's students vis-a-vis Livingston's--considerations that did not bear on the narrow \"dual\r\nschool system\" issue the parties contested before the Commissioner and here on appeal.  With\r\nregard to the dual school system issue, David Malone, superintendent of the Goodrich school\r\ndistrict, testified that the detachment would have the short-term effect of increasing slightly the\r\npercentage of minority students attending Goodrich I.S.D.  However, Malone speculated that if\r\nHoliday Estates and Siesta Country, two other all-white subdivisions bordering on the Livingston\r\ndistrict, were allowed to detach, Goodrich's percentages would change so that black and Hispanic\r\nstudents would constitute the majority.<strong><sup> (6)</sup></strong></span><span>  Based on this potential domino effect, Malone suggested\r\nthat the Forest Springs' detachment could encourage a dual school system.  Curtis Smith, a\r\nprincipal in Goodrich I.S.D., and Lorraine Barnes, a fifth grade teacher in Goodrich, also opined\r\nthat the detachment would be a step toward re-segregation that could eventually lead Goodrich\r\nback to a dual school system.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile we sympathize with Goodrich's position, its concern that the other white\r\nsubdivisions will follow suit in seeking annexation to Livingston is speculation not supported by\r\nany specific evidence in the record.  There is no suggestion that any other subdivision has applied\r\nfor detachment from Goodrich I.S.D.  Our holding in <em>Prosper</em> is instructive in this regard.  In that\r\ncase we held that the loss of potential tax revenues based on a detached territory's anticipated\r\nreclassification from agricultural to commercial development land was speculative and reasonably\r\ndisregarded by the county commissioners in approving the territory's detachment.  <em>Prosper</em>, 798\r\nS.W.2d at 666.  We held that the commissioners' decision to give dispositive weight to the\r\nevidence of current tax values was justified and supported by substantial evidence, even though\r\nthe future effect of a reclassification could be significant.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSimilarly, Goodrich's evidence that Forest Springs' detachment would precipitate\r\n\"white flight\" among other subdivisions was so speculative that the Commissioner was not bound\r\nto assign it dispositive weight.  Two of the twenty-two children affected by the boundary change\r\ncome from minority families, both of which signed the detachment petition.  Four Forest Springs\r\nparents, including one black parent, testified at the hearing that the proposed boundary change was\r\nnot racially motivated and emphasized that Livingston offered better educational and\r\nextracurricular opportunities for their children.  The superintendent of Livingston, Dr. Gerald\r\nMajor, supported the parents' position and testified that Livingston schools do not discriminate\r\non the basis of race, color, or national origin and that he did not approve Forest Springs'\r\nannexation petition on the basis of race.<strong><sup> (7)</sup></strong></span><span>  Forest Springs' non-discriminatory intent may be one\r\nfactor in the Commissioner's analysis of whether the proposed boundary change violates the dual\r\nschool system provision of the federal order.  <em>See Price v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist</em>., 945 F.2d\r\n1307, 1315 (5th Cir. 1991).  Even Dr. Alexius, who originally assumed that all of the Forest\r\nSprings students were white, admitted that his perception of the boundary change as white flight\r\nwas weakened when informed that two of the students affected by the annexation were minorities. \r\nWhile we appreciate Goodrich's concerns over the specter of white flight, we cannot say that the\r\nCommissioner's decision was unreasonable based on the current evidence in this case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Commissioner's finding that the proposed boundary change would not create,\r\nmaintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on race, color or national\r\norigin is supported by substantial evidence.  Although the boundary change would affect the racial\r\ncomposition of Goodrich by 2.5 percent, the school would remain integrated and unified. \r\nSubstantial evidence was presented that Livingston offers better educational opportunities and a\r\nwider variety of extracurricular programs than does Goodrich and that these opportunities\r\nmotivated Forest Springs to petition for annexation to Livingston.  Although Goodrich offered\r\ntestimony that Forest Springs' detachment constitutes a harbinger of future detachments that will\r\nresult in resegregation, this evidence was speculative and inconclusive.  Because the evidence\r\nsupports the positions of both Goodrich and Forest Springs, we must uphold the Commissioner's\r\ndecision.  <em>See Auto Convoy Co</em>., 507 S.W.2d at 722.  We sustain TEA and Forest Springs' first\r\npoint of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDue to our disposition of the first point of error, we need not address TEA and\r\nForest Springs' remaining points of error.

Richards was a small school district with 70% white\r\nstudents.  Huntsville was a large school district with a 65% white population.  The students\r\ntransferring to Huntsville changed the racial balance of Richards by seven percent.  In approving\r\nthe transfers, the court emphasized that, regardless of the seven-percent change in racial\r\ncomposition, the Richards school district would remain integrated and that black and white\r\nstudents would continue to attend the same school.  \r\n</p><p>5.      <strong>  A \"unitary\" school system has completely remedied all vestiges of past discrimination. \r\n</strong><em>See Price v.

Twenty white students and two minority students live in Forest Springs, which is\r\ncurrently within the Goodrich I.S.D. boundary.  Thirteen of these students have been attending\r\nLivingston schools without officially transferring to the school district.  In 1987, the Texas\r\nEducation Agency (\"TEA\") refused the requests of several Forest Springs students to transfer to\r\nLivingston I.S.D., explaining that the transfers violated Civil Order No. 5281 of the U.S. District\r\nCourt of the Eastern District of Texas as modified (the \"federal order\").<strong><sup> (1)</sup></strong></span><span>  The record is unclear\r\nas to which, if any, of the thirteen Forest Springs students unofficially attending Livingston I.S.D.\r\nwere the students whose transfer requests were denied.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn 1991, after Livingston discovered the students' unofficial attendance and\r\nthreatened to charge them tuition, the Forest Springs subdivision sought detachment from\r\nGoodrich and annexation to Livingston.  The Livingston I.S.D. Board of Trustees approved\r\nForest Springs' proposed annexation, but the Goodrich I.S.D. Board of Trustees denied the\r\ndetachment request.  Forest Springs appealed Goodrich's decision to the Commissioner of\r\nEducation.  <em>See</em> Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §§ 11.13, 19.022(i) (West 1991).  Section 19.022(i)\r\nprovides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>If the board of trustees for either affected district disapproves the petition, an\r\naggrieved party to the proceedings in either district may appeal the board's\r\ndecision to the commissioner of education under Section 11.13 of this code.  An\r\nappeal under this subsection is de novo.  In deciding this appeal, the commissioner\r\nshall consider the educational interests of the students in the affected territory and\r\nthe affected districts and the social, economic, and educational effects of the\r\nproposed boundary change.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 19.022(i) (West 1991).  Before the Commissioner's hearing on January\r\n6, 1992, the parties stipulated that the proposed annexation would have \"no substantial adverse\r\neducational, social, or economic effects to the students or to the school districts involved in this\r\ndispute,\" unless the Commissioner found that the annexation violated the federal order. \r\nPresumably, then, violation of the federal order was the sole educational effect the Commissioner\r\nwas to consider.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith regard to boundary changes, the federal order directs the TEA and the\r\nCommissioner of Education not to:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>permit, make arrangements for, approve, acquiesce in, or give support of any kind\r\nto changes in school boundary lineswhether by detachment, annexation, or\r\nconsolidation of districts in whole or in partwhich are designed to, or do in fact,\r\ncreate, maintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on\r\nrace, color, or national origin.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em></em></span><span><em>See United States v.

Dr. Robert Alexius, executive\r\nassistant to the Deputy Commissioner for Accountability at the TEA, investigated the proposed\r\nboundary change.  Alexius emphasized at the hearing that he merely provides the Commissioner\r\nwith numerical data regarding the racial composition of the affected schools and the anticipated\r\nracial change in the districts.  Alexius testified that Goodrich I.S.D. would be 60.1% white if all\r\nchildren from Forest Springs were properly enrolled in Goodrich I.S.D.  Livingston I.S.D. is\r\n80% white.  Alexius concluded that if Forest Springs' annexation were allowed, the white student\r\npopulation in Goodrich I.S.D. would decrease by 2.5 percent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlexius also explained that the TEA uses the federal order's one-percent transfer\r\nrule as a guideline in approving proposed boundary changes and that a boundary change which\r\nresults in a one-percent change in racial composition raises a red flag for possible violation of the\r\nfederal order.  However, he stressed that these statistics were only one factor in the\r\nCommissioner's analysis of whether the proposed change would violate the federal modified\r\norder.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth parties spent a significant amount of time in their briefs and at oral argument\r\ndiscussing the one-percent transfer rule.  However, under the terms of the federal order, the one-percent rule applies only to the analysis of transfer requests; the section governing boundary\r\nchanges was never amended and does not include a one-percent benchmark.<strong><sup> (3)</sup></strong></span><span>  Due to their scope,\r\nboundary changes have broader social, economic, and educational ramifications than individual\r\nstudent transfers and are poorly suited to determination through application of a rote mathematical\r\nformula.  Although we do not pass on the propriety of the TEA's use of the one-percent rule in\r\nanalyzing boundary change requests, it appears that the Commissioner, if he considers the one-percent transfer rule in boundary changes at all, should use this quantitative piece of evidence as\r\nonly one factor in assaying the broad, qualitative impact of a boundary change.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven the federal court that issued the order has noted that the one-percent rule\r\nshould not be applied rigidly.  In a subsequent modification to its original order, the court stressed\r\nthat, regardless of the percentage change in racial composition, the fact that the schools remain\r\nintegrated is an important factor in assessing proposed transfer requests.  <em>See United States v.\r\nState of Tex.</em>, Order Interpreting Modified Order of July 13, 1971 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 8, 1980)\r\n(unpublished).<strong><sup> (4)</sup></strong></span><span>  The same holds true in evaluating the segregative effect of a boundary change. \r\nEvidence was presented that both the Goodrich and Livingston school districts operate as unitary\r\nschool systems,<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong></span><span> are not operating under any court desegregation orders, and enjoy good\r\ninterracial relations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRegardless of the applicability of the one-percent rule, Goodrich maintains that\r\nForest Springs' detachment would precipitate defection to Livingston of other white\r\nneighborhoods currently within its boundary.  Goodrich presented a significant amount of\r\nevidence that the proposed boundary change would affect it negatively, as witnessed by the\r\nCommissioner's statement that \"the evidence presented barely shows . . . that detachment and\r\nannexation is in the best educational as well as the best social interests of the students in the\r\naffected territory.\"  However, some of this evidence related only to economic issues, such as the\r\ndistrict's loss of tax revenues, state funds and resulting budget problems, or the \"status\" of\r\nGoodrich's students vis-a-vis Livingston's--considerations that did not bear on the narrow \"dual\r\nschool system\" issue the parties contested before the Commissioner and here on appeal.  With\r\nregard to the dual school system issue, David Malone, superintendent of the Goodrich school\r\ndistrict, testified that the detachment would have the short-term effect of increasing slightly the\r\npercentage of minority students attending Goodrich I.S.D.  However, Malone speculated that if\r\nHoliday Estates and Siesta Country, two other all-white subdivisions bordering on the Livingston\r\ndistrict, were allowed to detach, Goodrich's percentages would change so that black and Hispanic\r\nstudents would constitute the majority.<strong><sup> (6)</sup></strong></span><span>  Based on this potential domino effect, Malone suggested\r\nthat the Forest Springs' detachment could encourage a dual school system.  Curtis Smith, a\r\nprincipal in Goodrich I.S.D., and Lorraine Barnes, a fifth grade teacher in Goodrich, also opined\r\nthat the detachment would be a step toward re-segregation that could eventually lead Goodrich\r\nback to a dual school system.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile we sympathize with Goodrich's position, its concern that the other white\r\nsubdivisions will follow suit in seeking annexation to Livingston is speculation not supported by\r\nany specific evidence in the record.  There is no suggestion that any other subdivision has applied\r\nfor detachment from Goodrich I.S.D.  Our holding in <em>Prosper</em> is instructive in this regard.  In that\r\ncase we held that the loss of potential tax revenues based on a detached territory's anticipated\r\nreclassification from agricultural to commercial development land was speculative and reasonably\r\ndisregarded by the county commissioners in approving the territory's detachment.  <em>Prosper</em>, 798\r\nS.W.2d at 666.  We held that the commissioners' decision to give dispositive weight to the\r\nevidence of current tax values was justified and supported by substantial evidence, even though\r\nthe future effect of a reclassification could be significant.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSimilarly, Goodrich's evidence that Forest Springs' detachment would precipitate\r\n\"white flight\" among other subdivisions was so speculative that the Commissioner was not bound\r\nto assign it dispositive weight.  Two of the twenty-two children affected by the boundary change\r\ncome from minority families, both of which signed the detachment petition.  Four Forest Springs\r\nparents, including one black parent, testified at the hearing that the proposed boundary change was\r\nnot racially motivated and emphasized that Livingston offered better educational and\r\nextracurricular opportunities for their children.  The superintendent of Livingston, Dr. Gerald\r\nMajor, supported the parents' position and testified that Livingston schools do not discriminate\r\non the basis of race, color, or national origin and that he did not approve Forest Springs'\r\nannexation petition on the basis of race.<strong><sup> (7)</sup></strong></span><span>  Forest Springs' non-discriminatory intent may be one\r\nfactor in the Commissioner's analysis of whether the proposed boundary change violates the dual\r\nschool system provision of the federal order.  <em>See Price v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569206\"><a href=\"/opinion/569206/samantha-price-etc-brandon-mcmurthy-etc-v-austin-independent-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span>, 1315 (5th Cir. 1991).  Even Dr. Alexius, who originally assumed that all of the Forest\r\nSprings students were white, admitted that his perception of the boundary change as white flight\r\nwas weakened when informed that two of the students affected by the annexation were minorities. \r\nWhile we appreciate Goodrich's concerns over the specter of white flight, we cannot say that the\r\nCommissioner's decision was unreasonable based on the current evidence in this case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Commissioner's finding that the proposed boundary change would not create,\r\nmaintain, reinforce, renew, or encourage a dual school system based on race, color or national\r\norigin is supported by substantial evidence.  Although the boundary change would affect the racial\r\ncomposition of Goodrich by 2.5 percent, the school would remain integrated and unified. \r\nSubstantial evidence was presented that Livingston offers better educational opportunities and a\r\nwider variety of extracurricular programs than does Goodrich and that these opportunities\r\nmotivated Forest Springs to petition for annexation to Livingston.  Although Goodrich offered\r\ntestimony that Forest Springs' detachment constitutes a harbinger of future detachments that will\r\nresult in resegregation, this evidence was speculative and inconclusive.  Because the evidence\r\nsupports the positions of both Goodrich and Forest Springs, we must uphold the Commissioner's\r\ndecision.  <em>See Auto Convoy Co</em>., 507 S.W.2d at 722.

In 1973 the federal order was\r\namended to include additional guidelines for the decisions regarding student transfers: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(3)(a) Where student transfers between school districts involve ethnic\r\nconsiderations concerning race, color or national origin of students, only hardship\r\nsituations shall be considered . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(b) In such situations, the [TEA] shall not approve transfers where the effect\r\nof such transfer will change the majority or minority percentage of the school\r\npopulation, based on average daily attendance in such districts by more than one\r\npercent (1%), in either the home or receiving district or the home or the receiving\r\nschool.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center>* * * *</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(4)(d) The agency will consider as factors relevant to its decision in approving\r\nor disapproving student transfers under this Section: (1) whether the receiving\r\ndistrict or the home district is composed solely of one race or ethnic origin, (2)\r\nwhether all the students seeking transfers are of one race or ethnic origin . . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>United States v. Texas</em>, Amendments to Modified Order of July 13, 1971 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 9,\r\n1973) (unpublished).\r\n<p>2.      <strong>  Because Education Code section 19.022(i) mandates that the Commissioner \"</strong><em>shall</em>\r\nconsider the educational interests of the students in the affected territory and the affected districts\r\nand the social, economic, and educational effects of the proposed boundary change\" in deciding\r\nan appeal, we doubt the ability of the parties to waive by stipulation the Commissioner's\r\nconsideration of these requirements.  <em>See</em> Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 19.022(i) (West 1991)\r\n(emphasis added).  However, the Commissioner specifically concluded that these requirements\r\nwere satisfied, and neither party has attacked this conclusion on appeal.  Moreover, although\r\nGoodrich attempted to withdraw its stipulation after the hearing before the Commissioner, it did\r\nnot assign error by cross-point to the district court's affirmance of the Commissioner's refusal to\r\nallow the withdrawal.\r\n</p><p>3.      <sup>3</sup>  Moreover, federal courts have held that, even when applied to transfers, the one-percent rule\r\nis properly used only as a guideline.  <em>See Lee v. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354240\"><a href=\"/opinion/354240/anthony-t-lee-united-states-of-america-plaintiff-intervenor-appellant/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 232\r\n(5th Cir. 1978) (holding that \"in measuring the cumulative effect of a student transfer program\r\non desegregation, the Court must do so from a qualitative viewpoint, without blind deference to\r\na mathematical formula\"). \r\n</p><p>4.      <strong>  In this unpublished case, </strong>which the parties relied on in construing the federal order below\r\nand which comes to us as part of the transcript, eight black and two white high school students\r\nwho lived in Richards Independent School District but had attended school in Huntsville applied\r\nfor a transfer to Huntsville I.S.D. schools.  Richards was a small school district with 70% white\r\nstudents.  Huntsville was a large school district with a 65% white population.  The students\r\ntransferring to Huntsville changed the racial balance of Richards by seven percent.  In approving\r\nthe transfers, the court emphasized that, regardless of the seven-percent change in racial\r\ncomposition, the Richards school district would remain integrated and that black and white\r\nstudents would continue to attend the same school.  \r\n</p><p>5.      <strong>  A \"unitary\" school system has completely remedied all vestiges of past discrimination. \r\n</strong><em>See Price v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569206\"><a href=\"/opinion/569206/samantha-price-etc-brandon-mcmurthy-etc-v-austin-independent-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span>, 1314 (5th Cir. 1991).\r\n</p><p>6.      <strong>  Goodrich North, another all-white subdivision, apparently does not share a common\r\nborder with Livingston.  </strong><em>See</em> Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §19.022(a) (West 1991) (requiring that the\r\ndetached territory seeking annexation be contiguous to the school district).   \r\n</p><p>7.      <sup>7</sup>  Major admitted, however, that Livingston has received complaints about the recruiting and\r\nhiring of minority teachers and that Livingston is involved in an ongoing investigation and civil\r\nlawsuit initiated by the NAACP.\r\n</p></span></p>\r\n</div>",
