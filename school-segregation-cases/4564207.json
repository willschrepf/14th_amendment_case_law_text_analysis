U.S.\nCustoms & Border Protection (“Customs”) classified the\nsubject merchandise under Subheading 6909.19.50 of the\nHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\n(“HTSUS”). 1 Schlumberger appealed Customs’s classifi-\ncation to the U.S. Court of International Trade (“CIT”).\nThe CIT rejected Customs’s classification and, instead,\nentered summary judgment that the subject merchandise\nshould enter under HTSUS 2606.00.00. Schlumberger\nTech. Corp. v. United States, 91 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1324\n(Ct. Int’l Trade 2015).\n   Appellant, the United States (“Government”), appeals.\nWe possess subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1295(a)(5) (2012). We affirm the CIT.\n                      BACKGROUND\n    The parties do not dispute the facts material to the\nresolution of the classification question before us. We\ndiscuss in turn the facts relevant to the subject merchan-\ndise, Customs’s classification, and the CIT’s decision\nbefore turning to the merits.\n\n\n\n    1   “All citations to the HTSUS refer to the 20[10]\nversion, as determined by the date of importation of the\nmerchandise.” LeMans Corp. v. United States, 660 F.3d\n1311, 1314 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2011).\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES                3\n\n\n\n                I. The Subject Merchandise\n    Schlumberger, an oil well services provider, J.A. 119,\nimported the subject bauxite proppants from the People’s\nRepublic of China, J.A. 1729. Schlumberger used the\nsubject merchandise in hydraulic fracturing services that\nit provided to customers in the United States. J.A. 126.\nThe subject merchandise, when combined with other\nmaterials after importation, increased oil well productivi-\nty by preventing fractures in rock formations from closing.\nJ.A. 126, 129, 281.\n    The subject bauxite proppants consisted of two mod-\nels: “S580-2040 Ceramic Proppant[s]” (“2040 Proppants”)\nand “S580-4070 Ceramic Proppant[s]” (“4070 Proppants”).\nJ.A. 119–20. “S580” referred to the designation used by\nSchlumberger for bauxite proppants produced by a specif-\nic third-party supplier, J.A. 125, and “2040” and “4070”\nreferred to the “size of sieves through which the prop-\npants can fit,” J.A. 123. Each model primarily consisted\nof “non-metallurgical bauxite,” 2 but the precise chemical\ncomposition of the merchandise is unknown because\nneither party retained a sample of the merchandise.\nJ.A. 1729; see J.A. 498–510. Each model measured less\nthan a millimeter in diameter and possessed specific\nphysical characteristics with associated values for crush\nresistance (i.e., strength), specific density, roundness, and\nsphericity. J.A. 122–23.\n\n\n\n\n    2  “Bauxite” refers to “an impure mixture of earthy\nhydrous aluminum oxides and hydroxides that commonly\ncontains similar compounds of iron and occas[ionally] of\nmanganese . . . and is the principal source of aluminum\nused in commerce and industry.” Bauxite, Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage Unabridged (1986) (“Webster’s”); J.A. 467 (similar).\n\f4               SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.    v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n     The production of the subject merchandise involved\nthe following steps. First, “[t]he raw materials of the\nsubject proppants were milled or ground to a fine pow-\nder.” J.A. 126. Second, the resulting powder underwent a\ngranulation process in a pan granulator, which resulted in\n“larger sized particles from the milled particles.”\nJ.A. 124. Third, “the particles [were] sorted” to determine\nwhether they met the required size specifications and, if\nso, the particles were dried. J.A. 124–25. Fourth, the\nparticles that fell within the required size specifications\nwere kiln fired. J.A. 125. Fifth, after firing, the particles\nwere sorted anew to ensure that ninety percent of them\nfell within the required size specifications. J.A. 125.\nFinally, the particles that met the previous steps were\npacked in bulk in 3,200 pound bags and exported to the\nUnited States as the subject bauxite proppants. J.A. 125.\n                  II. Procedural History\n    Customs classified the subject bauxite proppants un-\nder HTSUS 6909.19.50 at a duty rate of four percent ad\nvalorem. J.A. 120–21. The subheading selected by Cus-\ntoms covers “Ceramic wares for laboratory, chemical, or\nother technical uses; ceramic troughs, tubs and similar\nreceptacles of a kind used in agriculture; ceramic pots,\njars and similar articles of a kind used for the conveyance\nor packing of goods: Other: Other.” HTSUS 6909.19.50.\nSchlumberger contested the classification in separate\nprotests, 3 arguing that the subject merchandise should\nenter duty free under HTSUS 2606.00.0060 as “Alumi-\nnum ores and concentrates: Bauxite, calcined: Other.”\nJ.A. 109–10; see J.A. 162, 194. Customs denied the pro-\n\n\n\n    3  A party may protest Customs’s classification of\nmerchandise under 19 U.S.C. § 1514(a)(2) (2006). The\nparty may appeal Customs’s denial of the protest to the\nCIT. 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a).\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES                5\n\n\n\ntests, and Schlumberger appealed to the CIT. J.A. 107–\n12.\n    Following cross-motions for summary judgment, the\nCIT rejected Customs’s classification and entered sum-\nmary judgment that the subject bauxite proppants should\nenter under HTSUS 2606.00.00. See Schlumberger, 91 F.\nSupp. 3d at 1323–24. In relevant part, the CIT reasoned\nthat the applicable interpretive rules “preclude[d]” classi-\nfying the subject merchandise under HTSUS 6909.19.50\n“because the proppants are not ‘ceramic wares’ within the\nintended meaning of that term as used in [H]eading\n6909.” Id. at 1323. The CIT also found that the Govern-\nment’s “alternate classification” under Subheading\n6914.90.80 “is incorrect because [H]eading 6914 . . . is\nconfined to ‘ceramic articles’ rather than substances such\nas the proppants at issue.” Id. at 1323−24; see HTSUS\n6914.90.80 (covering “Other ceramic articles: Other:\nOther”). Having found these provisions inapplicable, the\nCIT concluded that the subject merchandise should enter\nunder HTSUS 2606.00.00 based on Heading 2606’s terms,\nguidance provided in the notes accompanying HTSUS\nChapter 26 and in other sources, and the undisputed\nmaterial facts. See Schlumberger, 91 F. Supp. 3d at\n1316–22.\n                        DISCUSSION\n                   I. Standard of Review\n    We review de novo the CIT’s decision to grant sum-\nmary judgment and apply anew the standard used by the\nCIT to assess the subject Customs classification. See\nOtter Prods., LLC v. United States, 834 F.3d 1369, 1374–\n75 (Fed. Cir. 2016). “Although we review the decision[] of\nthe CIT de novo, we give great weight to the informed\nopinion of the CIT . . . and it is nearly always the starting\npoint of our analysis.” Nan Ya Plastics Corp. v. United\nStates, 810 F.3d 1333, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (internal\nquotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted). The\n\f6              SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nCIT “shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” U.S. CIT R. 56(a) (2015).\n    The classification of merchandise involves a two-step\ninquiry. See LeMans, 660 F.3d at 1315. We first ascer-\ntain the meaning of the terms within the relevant tariff\nprovision and then determine whether the subject mer-\nchandise fits within those terms.          See Sigma-Tau\nHealthSci., Inc. v. United States, 838 F.3d 1272, 1276\n(Fed. Cir. 2016). The first step presents a question of law\nthat we review de novo, whereas the second involves an\nissue of fact that we review for clear error. Id. When, as\nhere, no genuine dispute exists as to the nature of the\nsubject merchandise, the two-step inquiry “collapses into\na question of law [that] we review de novo.” LeMans, 660\nF.3d at 1315 (citation omitted).\n II. The CIT Properly Classified the Subject Merchandise\n    The Government contests the CIT’s decision to classi-\nfy the subject bauxite proppants under HTSUS\n2606.00.00, arguing that the merchandise instead falls\nwithin the terms of HTSUS 6909.19.50 or, alternatively,\nHTSUS 6914.90.80. See Appellant’s Br. 17–35. The\nGovernment also contends that the subject merchandise\ndoes not meet the terms of HTSUS 2606.00.00. Id. at 35–\n43. After discussing the applicable legal framework, we\naddress these arguments in turn.\n                   A. Legal Framework\n    The HTSUS governs the classification of merchandise\nimported into the United States. See Wilton Indus., Inc.\nv. United States, 741 F.3d 1263, 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\nThe HTSUS “shall be considered to be statutory provi-\nsions of law for all purposes.”              19 U.S.C.\n§ 3004(c)(1).\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES                7\n\n\n\n    “The HTSUS scheme is organized by headings, each of\nwhich has one or more subheadings; the headings set\nforth general categories of merchandise, and the subhead-\nings provide a more particularized segregation of the\ngoods within each category.” 4 Wilton Indus., 741 F.3d at\n1266. “[T]he headings and subheadings . . . are enumer-\nated in chapters 1 through 99 of the HTSUS (each of\nwhich has its own section and chapter notes) . . . .” R.T.\nFoods, Inc. v. United States, 757 F.3d 1349, 1353 (Fed.\nCir. 2014) (footnote and citation omitted). The HTSUS\n“also contains the ‘General Notes,’ the ‘General Rules of\nInterpretation’ (‘GRI’), the ‘Additional [U.S.] Rules of\nInterpretation’ (‘ARI’),[5] and various appendices for\nparticular categories of goods.” Id. (footnote and citation\nomitted).\n    The GRI and the ARI govern the classification of\ngoods within the HTSUS. See Otter Prods., 834 F.3d at\n1375. The GRI apply in numerical order, meaning that\nsubsequent rules are inapplicable if a preceding rule\nprovides proper classification. See Mita Copystar Am. v.\nUnited States, 160 F.3d 710, 712 (Fed. Cir. 1998). GRI 1\nprovides, in relevant part, that “classification shall be\ndetermined according to the terms of the [HTSUS] head-\nings and any relative section or chapter notes . . . .” GRI 1\n(emphasis added). Under GRI 1, “a court first construes\nthe language of the heading, and any section or chapter\nnotes in question, to determine whether the product at\nissue is classifiable under the heading.” Orlando Food\n\n\n\n    4   The first four digits of an HTSUS provision consti-\ntute the heading, whereas the remaining digits reflect\nsubheadings.\n    5   The ARI contain specific rules for use and textile\nprovisions in the HTSUS. See ARI 1(a)–(d). Because the\nappeal involves eo nomine provisions, we find the ARI\ninapplicable. See infra Section II.B.\n\f8               SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nCorp. v. United States, 140 F.3d 1437, 1440 (Fed. Cir.\n1998). “[T]he possible headings are to be evaluated\nwithout reference to their subheadings, which cannot be\nused to expand the scope of their respective headings.”\nR.T. Foods, 757 F.3d at 1353 (citations omitted). “Absent\ncontrary legislative intent, HTSUS terms are to be con-\nstrued according to their common and commercial mean-\nings, which are presumed to be the same.” Carl Zeiss,\nInc. v. United States, 195 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999)\n(citation omitted). “To discern the common meaning of a\ntariff term, we may consult dictionaries, scientific author-\nities, and other reliable information sources.” Kahrs Int’l,\nInc. v. United States, 713 F.3d 640, 644 (Fed. Cir. 2013)\n(citation omitted).\n     “After consulting the headings and relevant section or\nchapter notes” consistent with GRI 1, we may consider the\nExplanatory Notes (“EN”) attendant to the relevant\nHTSUS headings. 6 Fuji Am. Corp. v. United States, 519\nF.3d 1355, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). The\nEN provide persuasive guidance and “are generally indic-\native of the proper interpretation,” though they do not\nconstitute binding authority. Kahrs, 713 F.3d at 645\n(citations omitted).\n    B. The Subject Merchandise Does Not Fall Within the\n              Terms of Heading 6909 or 6914\n    According to the Government, the subject merchan-\ndise constitutes “ceramic wares” under Heading 6909 or,\n\n\n\n     6  The World Customs Organization publishes the\nEN as its “official interpretation of the Harmonized\nCommodity Description and Coding System,” the “global\nsystem of trade nomenclature on which the HTSUS is\nbased.” Kahrs, 713 F.3d at 644 n.2; Michael Simon De-\nsign, Inc. v. United States, 33 Ct. Int’l Trade 1003, 1004–\n05 (2009) (discussing the HTSUS’s historical backdrop).\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES              9\n\n\n\nalternatively, “other ceramic articles” under Heading\n6914. See Appellant’s Br. 21–35. The CIT disagreed. See\nSchlumberger, 91 F. Supp. 3d at 1310–16. We agree with\nthe CIT.\n     We first must assess whether the subject Headings\nconstitute eo nomine or use provisions because different\nrules and analysis will apply depending upon the heading\ntype. Compare Kahrs, 713 F.3d at 645–46 (eo nomine\nanalysis), with Aromont USA, Inc. v. United States, 671\nF.3d 1310, 1312−16 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (principal use analy-\nsis). An eo nomine provision “describes an article by a\nspecific name,” whereas a use provision describes articles\naccording to their principal or actual use. Aromont, 671\nF.3d at 1312 (citation omitted); see id. at 1313. Heading\n6909 covers “Ceramic wares for laboratory, chemical, or\nother technical uses; ceramic troughs, tubs and similar\nreceptacles of a kind used in agriculture; ceramic pots,\njars and similar articles of a kind used for the conveyance\nor packing of goods.” Although Heading 6909 recites the\nuse of ceramic products for certain purposes, the operative\nquestion here asks whether the subject merchandise\nconstitutes a “ceramic ware” under the Heading’s terms.\nAs a result, we treat the Heading as eo nomine. See\nSigma-Tau, 838 F.3d at 1278 (treating an HTSUS provi-\nsion as eo nomine, despite the provision disclosing certain\nuses, when the interpretation centered on the terms\ndescribing an article by a specific name). Heading 6914,\nwhich recites “Other ceramic articles,” is unquestionably\neo nomine because it describes the articles it covers by\nname. See Aromont, 671 F.3d at 1312. Because the\nsubject Headings are eo nomine, our analysis starts with\ntheir terms. See R.T. Foods, 757 F.3d at 1354.\n    Neither the HTSUS nor the applicable legislative his-\ntory defines “ceramic wares” under Heading 6909 or\n“other ceramic articles” under Heading 6914. However,\nthe notes accompanying HTSUS Chapter 69 inform our\nconstruction of the subject Headings. Note 1 to HTSUS\n\f10              SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nChapter 69 explains that the Chapter’s provisions, includ-\ning Heading 6909 and Heading 6914, “appl[y] only to\nceramic products which have been fired after shaping.”\nHTSUS 69, Note 1. The Note does not define “shaping,”\nso we look to the dictionary to understand its common\nmeaning. See Sigma-Tau, 838 F.3d at 1279. The infini-\ntive form of the verb “shape” means “to give a particular\nor proper form to by or as if by molding or modeling from\nan undifferentiated mass” or “to give definite or finished\nshape to . . . .” Shape, Webster’s (emphases added). 7\n    The Government contends that the granulation pro-\ncess provides the requisite shape to the subject merchan-\ndise. Appellant’s Br. 23−25. The undisputed facts show\nthat it does not. As the CIT observed,\n     [w]hen the granules emerge from th[e] granula-\n     tion process, they range so substantially in size\n     that sieving is necessary to eliminate granules\n     that do not fall within the desired size range.\n     Even after the proppants are sieved so that 90% of\n     the proppants fall within the desired size range,\n     each of the two ranges characterizing the subject\n     merchandise still permits 100% variation in size.\nSchlumberger, 91 F. Supp. 3d at 1313 (citing J.A. 123–25)\n(internal citations omitted). The Government does not\ncontest the CIT’s observations. See generally Appellant’s\nBr. Indeed, an industry authority submitted by the\nGovernment corroborates the CIT’s observations.\nJ.A. 480 (listing “Granulation” as a step that occurs prior\n\n\n\n     7  The EN to Chapter 69 provide substantively simi-\nlar guidance, explaining in relevant part that “[t]he\nmanufacturing process of the ceramic products” classifia-\nble under Chapter 69 include a “[s]haping” step whereby\nthe material “is . . . shaped as nearly as possible to the\ndesired form.” EN 69, General (emphasis added).\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES              11\n\n\n\nto “Forming”). Thus, because the subject merchandise’s\nsize varied to such a significant degree after the granula-\ntion process, the undisputed facts counsel against finding\nthat the merchandise possessed the requisite definite\nshape following the granulation process. Possessing some\nshape does not equate to the definite shape required to\nenter under HTSUS Chapter 69, and a “desired form”\ncannot be any form at all since it would be impossible to\nshape something “as nearly as possible” to an indefinite\nstandard.\n    The principle of noscitur a sociis confirms our conclu-\nsion that the subject bauxite proppants do not fall within\nthe terms of either Heading 6909 or Heading 6914. That\nprinciple teaches “a word is known by the company it\nkeeps,” which “avoid[s] ascribing to one word a meaning\nso broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying\nwords.” Yates v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1074, 1085\n(2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\nBilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 604 (2010) (“[A]n ambigu-\nous term may be given more precise content by the neigh-\nboring words with which it is associated.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)); see also Jewelpak\nCorp. v. United States, 297 F.3d 1326, 1331, 1337 (Fed.\nCir. 2002) (affirming the use of noscitur a sociis to inter-\npret an HTSUS provision). 8 Heading 6909 covers “Ce-\nramic wares for laboratory, chemical, or other technical\n\n\n\n   8     A canon related to noscitur a sociis, ejusdem gene-\nris, instructs that “where general words follow an enu-\nmeration of specific items, the general words are read as\napplying only to other items akin to those specifically\nenumerated.” Harrison v. PPG Indus., Inc., 446 U.S. 578,\n588 (1980). We also have relied upon the principle of\nejusdem generis when interpreting HTSUS provisions.\nSee, e.g., Victoria’s Secret Direct, LLC v. United States,\n769 F.3d 1102, 1107 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n\f12              SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nuses; ceramic troughs, tubs and similar receptacles of a\nkind used in agriculture; ceramic pots, jars and similar\narticles of a kind used for the conveyance or packing of\ngoods.” The EN provide that Heading 6909 “covers a\nrange of very varied articles,” such as “crucibles and\ncrucible lids,” “mortars and pestles,” “beakers,” “contain-\ners with single or double walls,” “[c]ontainers of the kinds\nused for the commercial transport or packing of goods,”\nand “[t]roughs, tubs and similar containers of the type\nused in agriculture.” EN 69.09. The listed “wares” and\n“articles” concern individual products with definite forms.\nSee id.; see also EN 69, General (requiring products\nimported under HTSUS Chapter 69 to be “shaped as\nnearly as possible to the desired form”). As explained\nabove, the subject merchandise does not possess a definite\nform. J.A. 125–26. Because the subject merchandise does\nnot have a definite form, it cannot fall within that Head-\ning’s terms. See Yates, 135 S. Ct. at 1085.\n    The inclusion of “grinding apparatus and balls, etc.,\nfor grinding mills” in the EN accompanying Heading 6909\ndoes not require a different conclusion. But see Appel-\nlant’s Br. 30–31. The Government has not provided any\nevidence demonstrating that the subject bauxite prop-\npants and “grinding apparatus and balls” vary in shape to\na similar degree, such that the subject proppants similar-\nly should fall within Heading 6909. The Government’s\nspeculation cannot prevent the entry of summary judg-\nment against it. See First Nat’l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities\nServ. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 290 (1968) (finding entry of\nsummary judgment appropriate because of “the absence of\nany significant probative evidence” in support of a claim).\n    Finally, an examination of the EN accompanying\nHeading 6914 yields the conclusion that the subject\nbauxite proppants do not fall within that Heading’s terms.\nHeading 6914 covers “Other ceramic articles.” The EN\nexplain that Heading 6914 covers, inter alia, “[s]toves and\nother heating apparatus,” “non-decorative flower pots,”\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES              13\n\n\n\n“fittings for doors, windows, etc.,” “[l]etters, numbers,\nsign-plates and similar motifs for shop signs and shop\nwindows,” ceramic “[s]pring lever stoppers,” “jars and\ncontainers for laboratories,” and “other articles such as\nknife handles, school inkwells, humidifiers for radiators[,]\nand bird cage accessories.” EN 69.14. The listed exam-\nples concern individual products shaped into definite\nforms. See id.; see also EN 69, General (requiring prod-\nucts imported under HTSUS Chapter 69 to be “shaped as\nnearly as possible to the desired form”). Unlike the\nexamples provided in the EN, the subject proppants are\nbulk substances that lack a definite form. J.A. 125–26.\nBecause the subject proppants do not possess the requi-\nsite definite form like the products listed in Heading\n6914, they cannot fall within that Heading’s terms. See\nYates, 135 S. Ct. at 1085.\n C. The Subject Merchandise Falls Within the Terms of\n                    Heading 2606\n    Having found the subject bauxite proppants outside\nthe terms of Heading 6909 and Heading 6914, we next\nexamine Heading 2606. The Government argues that the\nCIT erred by finding the subject merchandise classifiable\nunder that Heading. Appellant’s Br. 35–43. We disagree.\n    Heading 2606 covers “Aluminum ores and concen-\ntrates.” The provision is eo nomine because it describes\nthe merchandise it covers by name. See Aromont, 671\nF.3d at 1312. Neither the HTSUS nor the applicable\nlegislative history defines “aluminum ore” under Heading\n2606. The notes accompanying HTSUS Chapter 26\ninform our construction of the subject Heading, providing\ntwo criteria. First, Note 2 to HTSUS Chapter 26 explains\nthat “the term ‘ores’ means minerals of mineralogical\nspecies actually used in the metallurgical industry for the\nextraction of” certain metals, “even if they are intended\nfor nonmetallurgical purposes.” HTSUS 26, Note 2.\nSecond, the Note states that HTSUS 2606 does not “in-\n\f14             SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nclude minerals which have been submitted to processes\nnot normal to the metallurgical industry.” Id.\n    The subject bauxite proppants meet each criterion.\nWith respect to the first, the subject merchandise contains\na mineral of a mineralogical species used in the metallur-\ngical industry for the extraction of a particular metal. EN\n26.06 provides that Heading 2606 “covers bauxite (hy-\ndrated aluminum oxide containing variable proportions of\niron oxide, silica, etc.).” The parties agree that “[t]he\nsubject proppants are produced from non-metallurgical\ngrade bauxite,” meaning that the subject proppants\ncontain the requisite mineral of a mineralogical species.\nJ.A. 1729. Moreover, the undisputed facts demonstrate\nthat the industry uses bauxite in the extraction of alumi-\nnum. J.A. 121 (“Metallurgical grade bauxite is used in\nthe metallurgical industry for the extraction of alumi-\nnum.”), 1729 (discussing the “commercial extraction of\naluminum metal from bauxite”).\n    The Government counters that the subject merchan-\ndise cannot meet the first criterion because Schlumberger\nused the subject merchandise “only for hydraulic fractur-\ning” and not the extraction of a particular metal. Appel-\nlant’s Br. 37. However, the Government overlooks a\nrelevant passage of Note 2 to HTSUS Chapter 26, which\nexplains that the Chapter covers ores “even if they are\nintended for non-metallurgical purposes,” so long as the\nindustry uses the ores for the extraction of metal. HTSUS\n26, Note 2. As stated above, it is undisputed that the\nindustry uses bauxite to extract aluminum. J.A. 121,\n1729.\n    Because the subject bauxite proppants satisfy the first\ncriterion articulated in Note 2 to HTSUS Chapter 26, we\nturn to the second to determine whether the subject\nmerchandise underwent processes not normal to the\nmetallurgical industry. Neither the HTSUS nor the\napplicable section and chapter notes provide guidance as\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES            15\n\n\n\nto what constitutes a “normal” process in the metallurgi-\ncal industry. However, the EN to Chapter 26 state that\naluminum ore classifiable under Heading 2606 may\nundergo, inter alia, “crushing,” “grinding,” “screening,”\n“agglomeration of powders . . . into grains, balls or bri-\nquettes,” and “drying.” EN 26, General. As stated above,\nthe subject bauxite proppants underwent these very steps\nduring the production process. J.A. 124–25. Thus, the\nCIT properly concluded that these processes “must be\nconsidered normal to the metallurgical industry and not\nthe sort of processing that would cause exclusion from\n[C]hapter 26 by operation of [N]ote 2 to [C]hapter 26,\nHTSUS.” Schlumberger, 91 F. Supp. 3d at 1318.\n    The Government contends that the CIT improperly\nfound the processes normal to the metallurgical industry\ndespite the fact that the processes were “not for the pur-\npose of preparing the proppants for the extraction of\nmetal.” Appellant’s Br. 42. Note 2 to HTSUS Chapter 26\nprovides only that the minerals may not be submitted to\nprocesses other than those normal to the metallurgical\nindustry; it does not require that any processing be un-\ndertaken “for the purpose” of extracting metal. HTSUS\n26, Note 2. Indeed, the Note expressly contemplates that\na product imported under the Chapter can be “intended\nfor non-metallurgical purposes.” Id.\n    The Government contends further that dopants were\nadded to the bauxite powder during the proppant manu-\nfacturing process and that the addition of dopants is not\nnormal to the metallurgical industry. 9 Appellant’s Br.\n37–40. As a result, the Government contends that the\n\n\n\n   9    The noun “dopant” means “an impurity added\nusually in minute amounts to a pure substance to alter its\nproperties.” J.A. 79. The identity of the dopants remains\nproprietary. Schlumberger, 91 F. Supp. 3d at 1318 n.18.\n\f16              SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nsubject merchandise cannot meet the second element in\nNote 2 of HTSUS Chapter 26. See id.\n     The addition of dopants to the bauxite powder does\nnot necessitate a different conclusion. The EN to Chapter\n26 explain that a process may remain normal to the\nindustry so long as it does “not alter the chemical compo-\nsition of the basic compound which furnishes the desired\nmetal.” EN 26, General. The Government has not offered\nany evidence demonstrating the extent to which the\ndopants changed the chemical composition of the bauxite\npowder; indeed, the Government was unable to state that\nthe dopants’ underlying chemicals at the exact levels\nfound in the subject merchandise would not themselves\nexist naturally in bauxite ore. Oral Argument at 12:07–\n14:24, http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx\n?fl=2015-2076.mp3.      Thus, the Government did not\ndemonstrate that the basic bauxite compound changed\nfrom consisting primarily of aluminum oxide so as to\noffend EN 26, and its speculation may not foreclose the\nentry of summary judgment. See First Nat’l Bank of\nAriz., 391 U.S. at 290.\n     Finally, the Government avers that the subject baux-\nite proppants do not fall within Heading 2606 because\nthey are “finished manufactured products immediately\nusable upon importation” and “not a ‘material’ or natural-\nly occurring ‘substance.’” Appellant’s Br. 35. According to\nthe Government, Heading 2606 is limited to “primary\nmaterials which will be further processed after importa-\ntion.” Id. at 1; see also id. at 17 (arguing that the CIT\nfailed to consider the subject merchandise in its “condition\nas imported” (capitalization omitted)).\n    The terms of Heading 2606 do not support the Gov-\nernment’s argument. Under GRI 1, we must look to “the\nterms of the [HTSUS] headings and any relative section\nor chapter notes.” As the CIT observed, “[n]othing in the\nterms of the heading, the section or chapter notes, or the\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES            17\n\n\n\nrelevant [EN] supports a conclusion that a product ready\nfor the intended use in the condition as imported is out-\nside the scope of the heading.” Schlumberger, 91 F. Supp.\n3d at 1320. That conclusion comports with the principle\nthat “an eo nomine provision” like Heading 2606 “includes\nall forms of the named article.” Kahrs, 713 F.3d at 646\n(citation omitted). Thus, we decline the Government’s\ninvitation to imbue Heading 2606 with a meaning not\nsupported by the Heading’s text or the accompanying\nsection and chapter notes.\n                      CONCLUSION\n    We have considered the Government’s remaining ar-\nguments and find them unpersuasive. Accordingly, the\nfinal judgment of the U.S. Court of International Trade is\n                      AFFIRMED\n\f",

The Subject Merchandise\n    Schlumberger, an oil well services provider, J.A. 119,\nimported the subject bauxite proppants from the People’s\nRepublic of China, J.A. 1729. Schlumberger used the\nsubject merchandise in hydraulic fracturing services that\nit provided to customers in the United States. J.A. 126.\nThe subject merchandise, when combined with other\nmaterials after importation, increased oil well productivi-\nty by preventing fractures in rock formations from closing.\nJ.A. 126, 129, 281.\n    The subject bauxite proppants consisted of two mod-\nels: “S580-2040 Ceramic Proppant[s]” (“2040 Proppants”)\nand “S580-4070 Ceramic Proppant[s]” (“4070 Proppants”).\nJ.A. 119–20. “S580” referred to the designation used by\nSchlumberger for bauxite proppants produced by a specif-\nic third-party supplier, J.A. 125, and “2040” and “4070”\nreferred to the “size of sieves through which the prop-\npants can fit,” J.A. 123. Each model primarily consisted\nof “non-metallurgical bauxite,” 2 but the precise chemical\ncomposition of the merchandise is unknown because\nneither party retained a sample of the merchandise.\nJ.A. 1729; see J.A. 498–510. Each model measured less\nthan a millimeter in diameter and possessed specific\nphysical characteristics with associated values for crush\nresistance (i.e., strength), specific density, roundness, and\nsphericity. J.A. 122–23.\n\n\n\n\n    2  “Bauxite” refers to “an impure mixture of earthy\nhydrous aluminum oxides and hydroxides that commonly\ncontains similar compounds of iron and occas[ionally] of\nmanganese . . . and is the principal source of aluminum\nused in commerce and industry.” Bauxite, Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage Unabridged (1986) (“Webster’s”); J.A. 467 (similar).\n\f4               SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.    v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n     The production of the subject merchandise involved\nthe following steps. First, “[t]he raw materials of the\nsubject proppants were milled or ground to a fine pow-\nder.” J.A. 126. Second, the resulting powder underwent a\ngranulation process in a pan granulator, which resulted in\n“larger sized particles from the milled particles.”\nJ.A. 124. Third, “the particles [were] sorted” to determine\nwhether they met the required size specifications and, if\nso, the particles were dried. J.A. 124–25. Fourth, the\nparticles that fell within the required size specifications\nwere kiln fired. J.A. 125. Fifth, after firing, the particles\nwere sorted anew to ensure that ninety percent of them\nfell within the required size specifications. J.A. 125.\nFinally, the particles that met the previous steps were\npacked in bulk in 3,200 pound bags and exported to the\nUnited States as the subject bauxite proppants. J.A. 125.\n                  II. Procedural History\n    Customs classified the subject bauxite proppants un-\nder HTSUS 6909.19.50 at a duty rate of four percent ad\nvalorem. J.A. 120–21. The subheading selected by Cus-\ntoms covers “Ceramic wares for laboratory, chemical, or\nother technical uses; ceramic troughs, tubs and similar\nreceptacles of a kind used in agriculture; ceramic pots,\njars and similar articles of a kind used for the conveyance\nor packing of goods: Other: Other.” HTSUS 6909.19.50.\nSchlumberger contested the classification in separate\nprotests, 3 arguing that the subject merchandise should\nenter duty free under HTSUS 2606.00.0060 as “Alumi-\nnum ores and concentrates: Bauxite, calcined: Other.”\nJ.A. 109–10; see J.A. 162, 194. Customs denied the pro-\n\n\n\n    3  A party may protest Customs’s classification of\nmerchandise under 19 U.S.C. § 1514(a)(2) (2006). The\nparty may appeal Customs’s denial of the protest to the\nCIT. 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a).\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES                5\n\n\n\ntests, and Schlumberger appealed to the CIT. J.A. 107–\n12.\n    Following cross-motions for summary judgment, the\nCIT rejected Customs’s classification and entered sum-\nmary judgment that the subject bauxite proppants should\nenter under HTSUS 2606.00.00. See Schlumberger, 91 F.\nSupp. 3d at 1323–24. In relevant part, the CIT reasoned\nthat the applicable interpretive rules “preclude[d]” classi-\nfying the subject merchandise under HTSUS 6909.19.50\n“because the proppants are not ‘ceramic wares’ within the\nintended meaning of that term as used in [H]eading\n6909.” Id. at 1323. The CIT also found that the Govern-\nment’s “alternate classification” under Subheading\n6914.90.80 “is incorrect because [H]eading 6914 . . . is\nconfined to ‘ceramic articles’ rather than substances such\nas the proppants at issue.” Id. at 1323−24; see HTSUS\n6914.90.80 (covering “Other ceramic articles: Other:\nOther”). Having found these provisions inapplicable, the\nCIT concluded that the subject merchandise should enter\nunder HTSUS 2606.00.00 based on Heading 2606’s terms,\nguidance provided in the notes accompanying HTSUS\nChapter 26 and in other sources, and the undisputed\nmaterial facts. See Schlumberger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Standard of Review\n    We review de novo the CIT’s decision to grant sum-\nmary judgment and apply anew the standard used by the\nCIT to assess the subject Customs classification. See\nOtter Prods., LLC v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1369</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1374–\n75 (Fed. Cir. 2016). “Although we review the decision[] of\nthe CIT de novo, we give great weight to the informed\nopinion of the CIT . . . and it is nearly always the starting\npoint of our analysis.” Nan Ya Plastics Corp. v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (internal\nquotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted). The\n\f6              SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nCIT “shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” U.S. CIT R. 56(a) (2015).\n    The classification of merchandise involves a two-step\ninquiry. See LeMans, 660 F.3d at 1315. We first ascer-\ntain the meaning of the terms within the relevant tariff\nprovision and then determine whether the subject mer-\nchandise fits within those terms.          See Sigma-Tau\nHealthSci., Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1276\n(Fed. Cir. 2016). The first step presents a question of law\nthat we review de novo, whereas the second involves an\nissue of fact that we review for clear error. Id. When, as\nhere, no genuine dispute exists as to the nature of the\nsubject merchandise, the two-step inquiry “collapses into\na question of law [that] we review de novo.” LeMans, 660\nF.3d at 1315 (citation omitted).\n II. The CIT Properly Classified the Subject Merchandise\n    The Government contests the CIT’s decision to classi-\nfy the subject bauxite proppants under HTSUS\n2606.00.00, arguing that the merchandise instead falls\nwithin the terms of HTSUS 6909.19.50 or, alternatively,\nHTSUS 6914.90.80. See Appellant’s Br. 17–35. The\nGovernment also contends that the subject merchandise\ndoes not meet the terms of HTSUS 2606.00.00. Id. at 35–\n43. After discussing the applicable legal framework, we\naddress these arguments in turn.\n                   A. Legal Framework\n    The HTSUS governs the classification of merchandise\nimported into the United States. See Wilton Indus., Inc.\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\nThe HTSUS “shall be considered to be statutory provi-\nsions of law for all purposes.”              19 U.S.C.\n§ 3004(c)(1).\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES                7\n\n\n\n    “The HTSUS scheme is organized by headings, each of\nwhich has one or more subheadings; the headings set\nforth general categories of merchandise, and the subhead-\nings provide a more particularized segregation of the\ngoods within each category.” 4 Wilton Indus., 741 F.3d at\n1266. “[T]he headings and subheadings . . . are enumer-\nated in chapters 1 through 99 of the HTSUS (each of\nwhich has its own section and chapter notes) . . . .” R.T.\nFoods, Inc. v.

The HTSUS\n“also contains the ‘General Notes,’ the ‘General Rules of\nInterpretation’ (‘GRI’), the ‘Additional [U.S.] Rules of\nInterpretation’ (‘ARI’),[5] and various appendices for\nparticular categories of goods.” Id. (footnote and citation\nomitted).\n    The GRI and the ARI govern the classification of\ngoods within the HTSUS. See Otter Prods., 834 F.3d at\n1375. The GRI apply in numerical order, meaning that\nsubsequent rules are inapplicable if a preceding rule\nprovides proper classification. See Mita Copystar Am. v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759216\"><a href=\"/opinion/759216/mita-copystar-america-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712 (Fed. Cir. 1998). GRI 1\nprovides, in relevant part, that “classification shall be\ndetermined according to the terms of the [HTSUS] head-\nings and any relative section or chapter notes . . . .” GRI 1\n(emphasis added). Under GRI 1, “a court first construes\nthe language of the heading, and any section or chapter\nnotes in question, to determine whether the product at\nissue is classifiable under the heading.” Orlando Food\n\n\n\n    4   The first four digits of an HTSUS provision consti-\ntute the heading, whereas the remaining digits reflect\nsubheadings.\n    5   The ARI contain specific rules for use and textile\nprovisions in the HTSUS. See ARI 1(a)–(d). Because the\nappeal involves eo nomine provisions, we find the ARI\ninapplicable. See infra Section II.B.\n\f8               SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v.

We agree with\nthe CIT.\n     We first must assess whether the subject Headings\nconstitute eo nomine or use provisions because different\nrules and analysis will apply depending upon the heading\ntype. Compare Kahrs, 713 F.3d at 645–46 (eo nomine\nanalysis), with Aromont USA, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1310</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1312−16 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (principal use analy-\nsis). An eo nomine provision “describes an article by a\nspecific name,” whereas a use provision describes articles\naccording to their principal or actual use. Aromont, 671\nF.3d at 1312 (citation omitted); see id. at 1313. Heading\n6909 covers “Ceramic wares for laboratory, chemical, or\nother technical uses; ceramic troughs, tubs and similar\nreceptacles of a kind used in agriculture; ceramic pots,\njars and similar articles of a kind used for the conveyance\nor packing of goods.” Although Heading 6909 recites the\nuse of ceramic products for certain purposes, the operative\nquestion here asks whether the subject merchandise\nconstitutes a “ceramic ware” under the Heading’s terms.\nAs a result, we treat the Heading as eo nomine. See\nSigma-Tau, 838 F.3d at 1278 (treating an HTSUS provi-\nsion as eo nomine, despite the provision disclosing certain\nuses, when the interpretation centered on the terms\ndescribing an article by a specific name). Heading 6914,\nwhich recites “Other ceramic articles,” is unquestionably\neo nomine because it describes the articles it covers by\nname. See Aromont, 671 F.3d at 1312. Because the\nsubject Headings are eo nomine, our analysis starts with\ntheir terms. See R.T. Foods, 757 F.3d at 1354.\n    Neither the HTSUS nor the applicable legislative his-\ntory defines “ceramic wares” under Heading 6909 or\n“other ceramic articles” under Heading 6914. However,\nthe notes accompanying HTSUS Chapter 69 inform our\nconstruction of the subject Headings. Note 1 to HTSUS\n\f10              SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nChapter 69 explains that the Chapter’s provisions, includ-\ning Heading 6909 and Heading 6914, “appl[y] only to\nceramic products which have been fired after shaping.”\nHTSUS 69, Note 1. The Note does not define “shaping,”\nso we look to the dictionary to understand its common\nmeaning. See Sigma-Tau, 838 F.3d at 1279. The infini-\ntive form of the verb “shape” means “to give a particular\nor proper form to by or as if by molding or modeling from\nan undifferentiated mass” or “to give definite or finished\nshape to . . . .” Shape, Webster’s (emphases added). 7\n    The Government contends that the granulation pro-\ncess provides the requisite shape to the subject merchan-\ndise. Appellant’s Br. 23−25. The undisputed facts show\nthat it does not. As the CIT observed,\n     [w]hen the granules emerge from th[e] granula-\n     tion process, they range so substantially in size\n     that sieving is necessary to eliminate granules\n     that do not fall within the desired size range.\n     Even after the proppants are sieved so that 90% of\n     the proppants fall within the desired size range,\n     each of the two ranges characterizing the subject\n     merchandise still permits 100% variation in size.\nSchlumberger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 1313 (citing J.A. 123–25)\n(internal citations omitted). The Government does not\ncontest the CIT’s observations. See generally Appellant’s\nBr. Indeed, an industry authority submitted by the\nGovernment corroborates the CIT’s observations.\nJ.A. 480 (listing “Granulation” as a step that occurs prior\n\n\n\n     7  The EN to Chapter 69 provide substantively simi-\nlar guidance, explaining in relevant part that “[t]he\nmanufacturing process of the ceramic products” classifia-\nble under Chapter 69 include a “[s]haping” step whereby\nthe material “is . . . shaped as nearly as possible to the\ndesired form.” EN 69, General (emphasis added).\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES              11\n\n\n\nto “Forming”). Thus, because the subject merchandise’s\nsize varied to such a significant degree after the granula-\ntion process, the undisputed facts counsel against finding\nthat the merchandise possessed the requisite definite\nshape following the granulation process. Possessing some\nshape does not equate to the definite shape required to\nenter under HTSUS Chapter 69, and a “desired form”\ncannot be any form at all since it would be impossible to\nshape something “as nearly as possible” to an indefinite\nstandard.\n    The principle of noscitur a sociis confirms our conclu-\nsion that the subject bauxite proppants do not fall within\nthe terms of either Heading 6909 or Heading 6914. That\nprinciple teaches “a word is known by the company it\nkeeps,” which “avoid[s] ascribing to one word a meaning\nso broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying\nwords.” Yates v.

The listed “wares” and\n“articles” concern individual products with definite forms.\nSee id.; see also EN 69, General (requiring products\nimported under HTSUS Chapter 69 to be “shaped as\nnearly as possible to the desired form”). As explained\nabove, the subject merchandise does not possess a definite\nform. J.A. 125–26. Because the subject merchandise does\nnot have a definite form, it cannot fall within that Head-\ning’s terms. See Yates, 135 S.

But see Appel-\nlant’s Br. 30–31. The Government has not provided any\nevidence demonstrating that the subject bauxite prop-\npants and “grinding apparatus and balls” vary in shape to\na similar degree, such that the subject proppants similar-\nly should fall within Heading 6909. The Government’s\nspeculation cannot prevent the entry of summary judg-\nment against it. See First Nat’l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities\nServ.

CORP.   v.

The listed exam-\nples concern individual products shaped into definite\nforms. See id.; see also EN 69, General (requiring prod-\nucts imported under HTSUS Chapter 69 to be “shaped as\nnearly as possible to the desired form”). Unlike the\nexamples provided in the EN, the subject proppants are\nbulk substances that lack a definite form. J.A. 125–26.\nBecause the subject proppants do not possess the requi-\nsite definite form like the products listed in Heading\n6914, they cannot fall within that Heading’s terms. See\nYates, 135 S. Ct. at 1085.\n C. The Subject Merchandise Falls Within the Terms of\n                    Heading 2606\n    Having found the subject bauxite proppants outside\nthe terms of Heading 6909 and Heading 6914, we next\nexamine Heading 2606. The Government argues that the\nCIT erred by finding the subject merchandise classifiable\nunder that Heading. Appellant’s Br. 35–43. We disagree.\n    Heading 2606 covers “Aluminum ores and concen-\ntrates.” The provision is eo nomine because it describes\nthe merchandise it covers by name. See Aromont, 671\nF.3d at 1312. Neither the HTSUS nor the applicable\nlegislative history defines “aluminum ore” under Heading\n2606. The notes accompanying HTSUS Chapter 26\ninform our construction of the subject Heading, providing\ntwo criteria. First, Note 2 to HTSUS Chapter 26 explains\nthat “the term ‘ores’ means minerals of mineralogical\nspecies actually used in the metallurgical industry for the\nextraction of” certain metals, “even if they are intended\nfor nonmetallurgical purposes.” HTSUS 26, Note 2.\nSecond, the Note states that HTSUS 2606 does not “in-\n\f14             SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nclude minerals which have been submitted to processes\nnot normal to the metallurgical industry.” Id.\n    The subject bauxite proppants meet each criterion.\nWith respect to the first, the subject merchandise contains\na mineral of a mineralogical species used in the metallur-\ngical industry for the extraction of a particular metal. EN\n26.06 provides that Heading 2606 “covers bauxite (hy-\ndrated aluminum oxide containing variable proportions of\niron oxide, silica, etc.).” The parties agree that “[t]he\nsubject proppants are produced from non-metallurgical\ngrade bauxite,” meaning that the subject proppants\ncontain the requisite mineral of a mineralogical species.\nJ.A. 1729. Moreover, the undisputed facts demonstrate\nthat the industry uses bauxite in the extraction of alumi-\nnum. J.A. 121 (“Metallurgical grade bauxite is used in\nthe metallurgical industry for the extraction of alumi-\nnum.”), 1729 (discussing the “commercial extraction of\naluminum metal from bauxite”).\n    The Government counters that the subject merchan-\ndise cannot meet the first criterion because Schlumberger\nused the subject merchandise “only for hydraulic fractur-\ning” and not the extraction of a particular metal. Appel-\nlant’s Br. 37. However, the Government overlooks a\nrelevant passage of Note 2 to HTSUS Chapter 26, which\nexplains that the Chapter covers ores “even if they are\nintended for non-metallurgical purposes,” so long as the\nindustry uses the ores for the extraction of metal. HTSUS\n26, Note 2. As stated above, it is undisputed that the\nindustry uses bauxite to extract aluminum. J.A. 121,\n1729.\n    Because the subject bauxite proppants satisfy the first\ncriterion articulated in Note 2 to HTSUS Chapter 26, we\nturn to the second to determine whether the subject\nmerchandise underwent processes not normal to the\nmetallurgical industry. Neither the HTSUS nor the\napplicable section and chapter notes provide guidance as\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES            15\n\n\n\nto what constitutes a “normal” process in the metallurgi-\ncal industry. However, the EN to Chapter 26 state that\naluminum ore classifiable under Heading 2606 may\nundergo, inter alia, “crushing,” “grinding,” “screening,”\n“agglomeration of powders . . . into grains, balls or bri-\nquettes,” and “drying.” EN 26, General. As stated above,\nthe subject bauxite proppants underwent these very steps\nduring the production process. J.A. 124–25. Thus, the\nCIT properly concluded that these processes “must be\nconsidered normal to the metallurgical industry and not\nthe sort of processing that would cause exclusion from\n[C]hapter 26 by operation of [N]ote 2 to [C]hapter 26,\nHTSUS.” Schlumberger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 1318.\n    The Government contends that the CIT improperly\nfound the processes normal to the metallurgical industry\ndespite the fact that the processes were “not for the pur-\npose of preparing the proppants for the extraction of\nmetal.” Appellant’s Br. 42. Note 2 to HTSUS Chapter 26\nprovides only that the minerals may not be submitted to\nprocesses other than those normal to the metallurgical\nindustry; it does not require that any processing be un-\ndertaken “for the purpose” of extracting metal. HTSUS\n26, Note 2. Indeed, the Note expressly contemplates that\na product imported under the Chapter can be “intended\nfor non-metallurgical purposes.” Id.\n    The Government contends further that dopants were\nadded to the bauxite powder during the proppant manu-\nfacturing process and that the addition of dopants is not\nnormal to the metallurgical industry. 9 Appellant’s Br.\n37–40. As a result, the Government contends that the\n\n\n\n   9    The noun “dopant” means “an impurity added\nusually in minute amounts to a pure substance to alter its\nproperties.” J.A. 79. The identity of the dopants remains\nproprietary. Schlumberger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 1318 n.18.\n\f16              SCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n\nsubject merchandise cannot meet the second element in\nNote 2 of HTSUS Chapter 26. See id.\n     The addition of dopants to the bauxite powder does\nnot necessitate a different conclusion. The EN to Chapter\n26 explain that a process may remain normal to the\nindustry so long as it does “not alter the chemical compo-\nsition of the basic compound which furnishes the desired\nmetal.” EN 26, General. The Government has not offered\nany evidence demonstrating the extent to which the\ndopants changed the chemical composition of the bauxite\npowder; indeed, the Government was unable to state that\nthe dopants’ underlying chemicals at the exact levels\nfound in the subject merchandise would not themselves\nexist naturally in bauxite ore. Oral Argument at 12:07–\n14:24, http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx\n?fl=2015-2076.mp3.      Thus, the Government did not\ndemonstrate that the basic bauxite compound changed\nfrom consisting primarily of aluminum oxide so as to\noffend EN 26, and its speculation may not foreclose the\nentry of summary judgment. See First Nat’l Bank of\nAriz., 391 U.S. at 290.\n     Finally, the Government avers that the subject baux-\nite proppants do not fall within Heading 2606 because\nthey are “finished manufactured products immediately\nusable upon importation” and “not a ‘material’ or natural-\nly occurring ‘substance.’” Appellant’s Br. 35. According to\nthe Government, Heading 2606 is limited to “primary\nmaterials which will be further processed after importa-\ntion.” Id. at 1; see also id. at 17 (arguing that the CIT\nfailed to consider the subject merchandise in its “condition\nas imported” (capitalization omitted)).\n    The terms of Heading 2606 do not support the Gov-\nernment’s argument. Under GRI 1, we must look to “the\nterms of the [HTSUS] headings and any relative section\nor chapter notes.” As the CIT observed, “[n]othing in the\nterms of the heading, the section or chapter notes, or the\n\fSCHLUMBERGER TECH. CORP.   v. UNITED STATES            17\n\n\n\nrelevant [EN] supports a conclusion that a product ready\nfor the intended use in the condition as imported is out-\nside the scope of the heading.” Schlumberger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 1320. That conclusion comports with the principle\nthat “an eo nomine provision” like Heading 2606 “includes\nall forms of the named article.” Kahrs, 713 F.3d at 646\n(citation omitted). Thus, we decline the Government’s\ninvitation to imbue Heading 2606 with a meaning not\nsupported by the Heading’s text or the accompanying\nsection and chapter notes.\n                      CONCLUSION\n    We have considered the Government’s remaining ar-\nguments and find them unpersuasive. Accordingly, the\nfinal judgment of the U.S. Court of International Trade is\n                      AFFIRMED\n\f</pre>",
