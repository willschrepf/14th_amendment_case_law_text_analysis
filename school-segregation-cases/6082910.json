We granted interlocutory appeal.\n\nFor the reasons expressed below, we reverse in part and affirm in part\n\nthe judgment of the district court.\n\n       I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n       This case involves claims brought against various state officials for\n\ndamages related to public employment. The petition as amended named\n\nthe State of Iowa and individual defendants Terry Branstad, Kimberly\n\nReynolds, Jeffrey Boeyink, Brenna Findley, Timothy Albrecht, and Teresa\n\nWahlert.    Christopher J. Godfrey stated in the petition that he was\n\nappointed Workers’ Compensation Commissioner in 2006 for a partial\n\nterm and then was subsequently appointed for a full term by Governor\n\nChet Culver in 2009. Godfrey pled that the position of commissioner was\n\nstatutorily defined as a six-year term, whereas the Iowa Constitution\n\nestablishes a four-year term for the governorship.           Since July of 2008\n\nuntil the incidents complained of by Godfrey, Godfrey alleged that his\n\nsalary was $112,068.84 a year, near the maximum in the statutorily set\n\nsalary range of $73,250-$112,070. See 2008 Iowa Acts ch. 1191, § 14(1),\n\n(5).\n\f                                           4\n\n       Godfrey alleged in the petition that defendant Branstad, prior to\n\ntaking    office,   demanded      Godfrey’s     resignation     by   a   letter   dated\n\nDecember 3, 2010.         Godfrey, however, asserted he refused to resign,\n\nclaiming that his position was quasi-judicial, intended to be nonpartisan,\n\nand insulated from politics because of the two-year difference in terms\n\nbetween the commissioner (six years) and the Governor (four years).\n\nGodfrey’s petition described several meetings with Branstad, Branstad’s\n\nstaff, and some of the other individual defendants in which Godfrey was\n\npressured to resign.       Godfrey alleges that as a result of his refusal to\n\nresign, he was punished by having his salary reduced to the statutory\n\nminimum of $73,250. Godfrey claims he suffered other retaliation in the\n\nworkplace at the hands of the defendants.\n\n       At issue in this interlocutory appeal are four counts alleging\n\nviolation of due process and equal protection provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution. 1 In Count VI, Godfrey alleges defendants deprived him of\n\nhis constitutionally protected property interest in his salary without due\n\nprocess of law because of partisan politics and/or his sexual orientation\n\nin violation of article I, section 9 of the Iowa Constitution. In Count VII,\n\nGodfrey alleges the defendants damaged his protected liberty interest in\nhis reputation without due process of law in violation of article I, section\n\n9 by falsely claiming poor work performance.                In Count VIII, Godfrey\n\nstates the State of Iowa deprived Godfrey of equal protection of the laws\n\nin violation of article I, section 6 by discriminating against Godfrey\n\nbecause of his sexual orientation. Finally, in Count IX, Godfrey alleges\n\n\n       1After filing this interlocutory appeal, Godfrey voluntarily dismissed counts XII,\nXIII, XIV, XV, XVII, XVIII, and a second count labeled “XIV.” These were defamation\ncounts brought against various individual defendants. No other counts were dismissed,\nincluding the counts raising Bivens-type claims against the individual defendants.\n\f                                     5\n\nthe individual defendants deprived him of equal protection of the laws by\n\ntreating homosexual appointed state officers or homosexual individuals\n\ndifferently than heterosexual appointed state officers or heterosexual\n\nindividuals, also in violation of article I, section 6 of the Iowa\n\nConstitution. Under all these claims, Godfrey asks for actual damages,\n\npunitive damages, attorney’s fees, court costs, and interest.\n\n      The defendants moved for summary judgment. According to the\n\ndefendants, they were entitled to summary judgment because there is no\n\nprivate cause of action for money damages for violation of article I,\n\nsections 6 and 9 of the Iowa Constitution.         In the alternative, the\n\ndefendants argued that Godfrey’s claims were preempted by the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act, Iowa Code chapter 216 (2009).\n\n      The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants\n\non the Iowa constitutional claims.    The district court explained that it\n\nconsidered the motion for summary judgment as a motion to dismiss\n\nbecause neither party asserted any particular facts upon which the\n\ndistrict court should base its decision.    The district court noted that\n\nfederal precedent in Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 99 S. Ct. 2264\n\n(1979), and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of\n\nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S. Ct. 1999 (1971), appeared to support a\n\ncause of action for due process violations in a wrongful termination case.\n\nFurther, the district court recognized that “[s]ignificant public policy\n\narguments favor recognition of such claims.”      Nonetheless, the district\n\ncourt found that a recent unpublished court of appeals decision holding\n\nthere are no private causes of action for violations of the Iowa\n\nConstitution was dispositive and dismissed Godfrey’s constitutional\n\nclaims.   See Conklin v. State, No. 14–0764, 2015 WL 1332003, at *5\n\n(Iowa Ct. App. Mar. 25, 2015).\n\f                                    6\n\n      Godfrey applied for interlocutory review.         We granted the\n\napplication.   For the reasons expressed below, a majority of the court\n\nconcludes that Bivens claims are available under the Iowa Constitution\n\nand that the claims raised by plaintiff in Counts VI and VII were\n\nimproperly dismissed. On the question of whether the Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct provides an adequate remedy sufficient to stay any Bivens-type\n\nclaim, a majority concludes that the remedy provided by chapter 216 is\n\nadequate under the facts and circumstances of this case, and that as a\n\nresult, Counts VIII and IX of the plaintiff’s complaint were properly\n\ndismissed.\n\n      II. Standard of Review.\n\n      A motion for summary judgment is appropriately granted when\n\n“there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”      Iowa R. Civ. P.\n\n1.981(3).    “We review the legal issues necessary for resolution of the\n\nconstitutional claims presented within the context of the summary\n\njudgment proceeding de novo.” Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 874\n\n(Iowa 2009); accord Kistler v. City of Perry, 719 N.W.2d 804, 805 (Iowa\n\n2006).\n\n      Generally, our review on a motion to dismiss is for correction of\n\nerrors at law.    Hedlund v. State, 875 N.W.2d 720, 724 (Iowa 2016);\n\nMueller v. Wellmark, Inc., 818 N.W.2d 244, 253 (Iowa 2012).         To the\n\nextent that we review constitutional claims within a motion to dismiss,\n\nour review is de novo.    McGill v. Fish, 790 N.W.2d 113, 116–17 (Iowa\n\n2010); State v. Taeger, 781 N.W.2d 560, 564 (Iowa 2010).            If the\n\npetitioner fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we will\n\naffirm a grant of a motion to dismiss. Hedlund, 875 N.W.2d at 724; King\n\nv. State, 818 N.W.2d 1, 8 (Iowa 2012). In ruling on a motion to dismiss,\n\f                                      7\n\nwe accept all well-pled facts in the petition as true. Shumate v. Drake\n\nUniv., 846 N.W.2d 503, 507 (Iowa 2014); Geisler v. City Council of Cedar\n\nFalls, 769 N.W.2d 162, 165 (Iowa 2009).\n\n     III. Claims for Monetary Damages Under Article I, Section 6\nand Article I, Section 9 of the Iowa Constitution.\n\n      A. Positions of the Parties.\n\n      1. Godfrey. Godfrey argues that article I, section 6 and article I,\n\nsection 9 of the Iowa Constitution are self-executing.            As a result,\n\naccording to Godfrey, no implementing legislation is necessary for\n\nGodfrey to bring a claim against the defendants for monetary damages\n\nunder the specific Iowa constitutional provisions involved in this case.\n\n      Godfrey cites United States Supreme Court precedent as providing\n\npersuasive reasoning that some constitutional provisions are self-\n\nexecuting. The United States Supreme Court declared in Davis v. Burke\n\nthat a constitutional provision may be said to be “self-executing” if it\n\n“supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right given may be\n\nenjoyed and protected, or the duty imposed may be enforced.” 179 U.S.\n\n399, 403, 21 S. Ct. 210, 212 (1900). According to Godfrey, the reasoning\n\nin Davis supports his position that the due process and equal protection\nprovisions of article I, sections 6 and 9 of the Iowa Constitution fall\n\nwithin the self-executing category.\n\n      Godfrey   further   argues   that   it   would   be    illogical   for   the\n\nfundamental principles in these key Iowa constitutional provisions to\n\ndepend upon legislative action for enforcement.             In support of his\n\nargument, Godfrey cites passages in Varnum where we stated that the\n\npurpose of constitutional provisions such as the equal protection clause\n\nwas to place certain subjects beyond the reach the elected branches and\n\ninstead entrust their enforcement to the courts. 763 N.W.2d at 875–76\n\f                                     8\n\nGodfrey further cites Marbury v. Madison, in which Justice Marshall\n\nwrote, “The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists of the right of\n\nevery individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives\n\nan injury.”   5 U.S. 137, 163 (1803).       Thus, according to Godfrey, a\n\nrequirement of legislation to enforce fundamental nonmajoritarian\n\nconstitutional rights makes no sense.\n\n      Godfrey recognizes that article XII, section 1 of the Iowa\n\nConstitution provides that the legislature “shall pass all laws necessary\n\nto carry [the] constitution into effect.”   Godfrey emphasizes the word\n\n“necessary” in article XII, section 1. Godfrey argues that no legislation is\n\nnecessary to enforce the due process and equal protections clauses of the\n\nIowa Constitution. He cites appellate state court cases that have held\n\nthat Bivens-type remedies are available notwithstanding similar language\n\nin their state constitutions. See, e.g., Widgeon v. E. Shore Hosp. Ctr., 479\n\nA.2d 921, 930 (Md. 1984); Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., 389 A.2d\n\n465, 476 (N.J. 1978).\n\n      Turning to more modern federal cases, Godfrey draws support\n\nfrom Bivens, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S. Ct. 1999. In Bivens, the United States\n\nSupreme Court recognized a private cause of action for damages for\n\nviolation of the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nId. at 397, 91 S. Ct. at 2005.\n\n      In addition to federal cases, Godfrey looks for common law support\n\nof his claims.   He argues that the Restatement (Second) of Torts and\n\nEnglish common law principles are embraced in section 874A of the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts, which provides,\n\n      When a legislative provision [defined in comment a as\n      including constitutional provisions] protects a class of\n      persons by proscribing or requiring certain conduct but does\n      not provide a civil remedy for the violation, the court may, if\n\f                                    9\n      it determines that the remedy is appropriate in furtherance\n      of the purpose of the legislation and needed to assure the\n      effectiveness of the provision, accord to an injured member\n      of the class a right of action, using suitable existing tort\n      action or a new cause of action analogous to an existing tort\n      action.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 874A & cmt. a, at 301 (Am. Law Inst.\n\n1979) [hereinafter Restatement (Second)].     Godfrey notes many state\n\ncourts that have found state constitutional provisions self-enforcing have\n\nrelied upon this section of the Restatement (Second) as authoritative.\n\n      Echoing Justice Harlan’s concurrence in Bivens, Godfrey also\n\ncontends that English common law long recognized a cause of action for\n\ndamages for violation of rights secured by fundamental charters and\n\nconstitutions. Justice Harlan also noted that if an explicit congressional\n\nauthority were required to authorize a damage remedy under the\n\nConstitution, then an explicit authority should also be required for\n\nequitable relief. Bivens, 403 U.S. at 405, 91 S. Ct. at 2009 (Harlan, J.,\n\nconcurring).\n\n      Additionally, Godfrey points to the law of remedies in support of\n\nhis claims. Godfrey notes that we have repeatedly provided injunctive\n\nrelief for constitutional violations without any enabling legislation. See,\n\ne.g., Hensler v. City of Davenport, 790 N.W.2d 569, 590 (Iowa 2010);\n\nState v. Dudley, 766 N.W.2d 606, 622 (Iowa 2009); Varnum, 763 N.W.2d\n\nat 906.\n      Godfrey argues there is no ordinary common law tort or statutory\n\naction that will provide him with complete relief.       With respect to\n\ncommon law torts, Godfrey cites Bivens, where “the Court acknowledged\n\nthat the common law could not adequately regulate the government’s\n\nunique power to inflict injury upon individuals.”     James J. Park, The\n\nConstitutional Tort Action as Individual Remedy, 38 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L.\n\f                                    10\n\nRev. 393, 413 (2003); see Bivens, 403 U.S. at 394, 91 S. Ct. at 2003\n\n(majority opinion). Godfrey also argues the statutory remedies under the\n\nIowa Civil Rights Act are insufficient to vindicate his constitutional\n\ninterests.   The Iowa Civil Rights Act does not address discrimination\n\nbased on partisan politics or his alleged deprivations of property or\n\nliberty as a result of partisan politics.      Thus, Godfrey argues, the\n\nstatutory remedy is insufficient to afford him complete relief.\n\n      Further, Godfrey notes that the remedies under the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act do not provide the same measure of deterrence as a Bivens\n\naction. Godfrey cites FDIC v. Meyers, 510 U.S. 471, 485, 114 S. Ct. 996,\n\n1005 (1994), and Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 21–22, 100 S. Ct. 1468,\n\n1473 (1980), for the proposition that Bivens remedies offer more effective\n\ndeterrence than most statutory remedies because of the availability of\n\npunitive damages and the prospect of individual liability.\n\n      Having established the general framework of analysis, Godfrey\n\nthen turns to Iowa caselaw. Godfrey argues that our prior caselaw does\n\nnot impede, and in fact supports, recognizing a private cause of action.\n\nGodfrey cites several of our early twentieth century cases which he\n\nmaintains stand for the proposition that damages are available for\n\nviolations of the Iowa Constitution.     See, e.g., Girard v. Anderson, 219\n\nIowa 142, 148, 257 N.W. 400, 403 (1934); McClurg v. Brenton, 123 Iowa\n\n368, 371, 98 N.W. 881, 882 (1904). Godfrey further claims that Conklin,\n\nthe recent court of appeals case, is factually and procedurally\n\ndistinguishable, was incorrectly decided, and moreover, is not binding\n\nprecedent. See 2015 WL 1332003, at *1.\n\n      2. Defendants.    The defendants argue that the due process and\n\nequal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution are not self-executing.\n\nThey claim the plain language of article XII, section 1 requires that “[t]he\n\f                                         11\n\ngeneral assembly shall pass all laws necessary to carry this constitution\n\ninto effect.”   Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1.      While Godfrey focuses on the\n\nnarrow term “necessary,” the defendants draw our attention to the use of\n\n“shall” in the constitutional provision.\n\n      The defendants argue that if the drafters of the Iowa Constitution\n\nhad intended the Iowa Constitution to be self-executing, they would have\n\nsaid so. The defendants argue that if the Iowa Constitution was, in fact,\n\nself-executing,   the    language   in    article   XII,   section   1   would    be\n\nunnecessary.      Further, the defendants point to article I, section 18,\n\nwhich provides that “[p]rivate property shall not be taken for public use\n\nwithout just compensation first being made.” Iowa Const. art. I, § 18.\n\nThis provision, defendants argue, is the only provision in the Bill of\n\nRights which explicitly authorizes an award of money damages.                    The\n\ndefendants note that while a number of states have enacted an analogue\n\nof 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for state constitutional claims, Iowa has not enacted\n\nsuch a statute.\n\n      The defendants rely on a trilogy of our prior cases to support their\n\nargument that the due process and equal protection clauses of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are not self-executing. The first case is State ex rel. Halbach\n\nv. Claussen, 216 Iowa 1079, 250 N.W. 195 (1933).                In Claussen, this\n\ncourt considered whether the provisions of article IV, section 10 of the\n\nIowa Constitution dealing with holding elections to fill vacancies for office\n\nwere self-executing. Id. at 1091, 250 N.W. at 200. The Claussen court\n\nheld that they were not. Id.\n\n      The second Iowa case cited by the defendants in support of their\n\nargument that the due process and equal protection clauses of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are not self-executing is Pierce v. Green, 229 Iowa 22, 294\n\nN.W. 237 (1940).        In Pierce, the plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus\n\f                                     12\n\nordering the state tax commission to convene and directing them to\n\nexercise their honest discretion in assessing all property. Id. at 27, 294\n\nN.W. at 242. We reversed a dismissal of the plaintiff’s action. Id. at 55,\n\n294 N.W. at 256. In passing, the Pierce court stated that provisions of\n\nthe Iowa Constitution, including the equal protection clause, “are not\n\nself-executing, but require legislative action to make them effective.” Id.\n\nat 29, 294 N.W. at 243.\n\n      The third Iowa case cited by the defendants is Van Baale v. City of\n\nDes Moines, 550 N.W.2d 153 (Iowa 1996). In Van Baale, we considered\n\nclaims brought by a discharged Des Moines police officer who\n\nunsuccessfully protested his dismissal through the administrative\n\nprocess and through judicial review before finally brining a separate\n\nequal protection action. Id. at 154. We held that Van Baale had failed to\n\nassert a viable equal protection claim because he did not specify any\n\ngroup of persons who were treated differently as a class. Id. at 157.\n\n      In addition to this substantive holding, however, the Van Baale\n\ncourt added additional language.       Id.     The Van Baale court stated,\n\n“Although the equal protection clause creates a constitutionally protected\n\nright, that right is not self-enforcing.     Equal protection rights may be\n\nenforced only if the Congress or a legislature provides a means of redress\n\nthrough appropriate legislation.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n      Defendants concede that a number of other state supreme courts\n\nhave recognized direct damage actions under their state constitutions\n\nwithout specific legislation. However, defendants maintain that some of\n\nthese state constitutions have different enabling clauses and other\n\nconstitutional provisions.     The defendants claim that these other\n\nconstitutional provisions provide a stronger basis for damages action\n\nthan the provisions of the Iowa Constitution.\n\f                                       13\n\n        The defendants recognize that in Bivens, the United States\n\nSupreme Court recognized a direct cause of action for a search and\n\nseizure violation of the United States Constitution. 403 U.S. at 397, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2005.       The defendants argue that in more recent cases, the\n\nCourt has retreated from its Bivens holding. See, e.g., Corr. Servs. Corp.\n\nv. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74, 122 S. Ct. 515, 523 (2001); Chappell v.\n\nWallace, 462 U.S. 296, 305, 103 S. Ct. 2362, 2368 (1983).\n\n        The defendants assert that creating a direct cause of action for\n\nviolations of the due process and equal protections clauses would violate\n\nseparation of powers. Given the express language of the enabling clause\n\ngranting the power to enact laws in order to effectuate the Iowa\n\nConstitution to the legislature, the courts cannot usurp the power of the\n\nlegislature by declaring the due process and equal protection provisions\n\nof the Iowa Constitution to be self-executing. Defendants cite cases from\n\nother states reprising such separation of powers concerns.              See, e.g.,\n\nLewis v. State, 629 N.W.2d 868, 871 (Mich. 2001); Bandoni v. State, 715\n\nA.2d 580, 595 (R.I. 1998).\n\n        Finally, the defendants argue that the early twentieth century\n\ncases such as McClurg, 123 Iowa 368, 98 N.W. 881, and Girard, 219 Iowa\n\n142, 257 N.W. 400, that Godfrey cites as supporting a direct cause of\n\naction are inapposite. These cases, defendants stress, are factually and\n\nlegally distinguishable from Godfrey’s case.\n\n        B.   Approach of United States Supreme Court to Question of\n\nWhether Provisions of the United States Constitution Are Self-\n\nExecuting for Purposes of Actions for Money Damages.                    This case\n\ndeals    with   the    proper   interpretation   of   provisions   of   the   Iowa\n\nConstitution.    Although the precedents of the United States Supreme\n\nCourt under the United States Constitution are not binding upon us in\n\f                                     14\n\nour interpretation of the Iowa Constitution, we may nonetheless give\n\nthem respectful consideration in our independent analysis.          State v.\n\nOchoa, 792 N.W.2d 260, 267 (Iowa 2010).             We may consider the\n\npersuasiveness of federal precedent, but we are by no means bound by it.\n\nState v. Short, 851 N.W.2d 474, 490 (Iowa 2014); State v. Baldon, 829\n\nN.W.2d 785, 790 (Iowa 2013); State v. Pals, 805 N.W.2d 767, 771 (Iowa\n\n2011).\n\n      The key modern United States Supreme Court precedent on the\n\nquestion of whether provisions of the United States Constitution are self-\n\nexecuting without legislative implementation is Bivens, 403 U.S. at 397,\n\n91 S. Ct. at 2005.    Bivens claimed that Federal Bureau of Narcotics\n\nagents entered his apartment without a warrant, arrested him,\n\nthreatened to arrest his family, searched the apartment “from stem to\n\nstern,” and took him to a federal courthouse where he was interrogated,\n\nbooked, and strip searched. Id. at 389, 91 S. Ct. at 2001. Bivens sought\n\ndamages for the humiliation and mental suffering he sustained from the\n\nagents’ unlawful conduct based on alleged violation of the search and\n\nseizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 389–90, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n2001. The agents moved to dismiss, arguing that Bivens’s only remedies\n\nexisted under state law in tort for violation of the right to privacy. Id. at\n\n390, 91 S. Ct. at 2001–02.         The agents argued that the Fourth\n\nAmendment only applied to limit the ability of the agents to defend their\n\nactions as being a valid exercise of federal power—if the agents’ actions\n\noffended the Fourth Amendment, then they would be treated under state\n\nlaw as private individuals. Id. at 390–91, 91 S. Ct. at 2002.\n\n      The Bivens Court rejected the agents’ argument, maintaining that\n\nwhen federal agents violate the Fourth Amendment their power as federal\n\nagents “does not disappear like a magic gift when it is wrongfully used.”\n\f                                    15\n\nId. at 391–92, 91 S. Ct. at 2002.        The Fourth Amendment protects\n\nindividuals from wrongful conduct whether or not state law would find\n\nfault with the same conduct if committed by a private individual. Id. at\n\n392–94, 91 S. Ct. at 2002–03.\n\n      The Bivens Court further explained that the privacy rights\n\nprotected by state law and the Fourth Amendment may be “inconsistent\n\nor even hostile” with one another. Id. at 394, 91 S. Ct. at 2003. For\n\nexample, if a private individual is granted entry to one’s home, then the\n\nprivate individual is not liable for trespass—had the homeowner not\n\nwished to grant the private individual entry, the homeowner could\n\nlawfully bar entry or call the police. Id. at 394–95, 91 S. Ct. at 2003–04.\n\nIf, however, the individual seeking to enter is acting under federal\n\nauthority, it is futile to resist entry—the police would not assist the\n\nhomeowner in repelling an unwelcome federal agent. See id. at 395, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2004. State law may not act to expand or circumscribe federal\n\npower; only federal law may so act.        Id.   The Fourth Amendment,\n\ntherefore, must exist as a claim independent from any other state law\n\nclaims. Id.\n\n      The Bivens Court supported the imposition of damages for\n\nviolations of the Fourth Amendment by explaining that an action for\n\ndamages has historically been the ordinary remedy for invasions of\n\nprivacy interests. Id. The Court explained it is “well settled that where\n\nlegal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a\n\ngeneral right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any\n\navailable remedy to make good the wrong done.” Id. at 396, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n2004 (quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S. Ct. 773, 777\n\n(1946)). In Bivens, the Court found no special factors which would urge\n\nhesitation to create a cause of action absent legislative action, citing\n\f                                     16\n\nspecial factors like “federal fiscal policy” and imposing liability on a\n\ncongressional employee acting in excess of authority lawfully delegated\n\nby Congress. Id. at 396–97, 91 S. Ct. at 2004–05. Finally, the Court\n\nexplained, actions for damages have not been expressly forbidden by\n\nCongress in favor of another remedy which Congress views as equally\n\neffective. Id. at 397, 91 S. Ct. at 2005.\n\n      Justice Harlan concurred in the judgment, explaining that it was\n\nuncontroversial that Bivens had a right to be free from unlawful searches\n\nand seizures, but that the real question was whether the Constitution\n\nplaced the ability to create an action for damages for constitutional\n\nviolations exclusively in the hands of Congress. Id. at 399–400, 91 S. Ct.\n\nat 2006 (Harlan, J., concurring).       Justice Harlan reasoned that the\n\nSupreme Court possessed the authority to create an action for damages\n\nbecause (1) the decision to grant damages does not involve “policy\n\nconsiderations not susceptible of judicial discernment”; (2) the Court has\n\nalways had the power to grant equitable relief for invasions of\n\nconstitutional interests without explicit congressional authorization and\n\n      if a general grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts by\n      Congress is thought adequate to empower a federal court to\n      grant equitable relief . . . then it seems . . . that the same\n      statute is sufficient to empower a federal court to grant a\n      traditional remedy at law;\n\n(3) state remedies for violations of common law rights are limited when\n\napplied to federal officials acting under color of law; (4) injuries of the\n\nkind Bivens suffered cannot be remedied by an injunction—they have\n\nalready occurred; and (5) recognizing a cause of action for damages\n\nwould likely not result in a great expenditure of judicial resources\n\nhearing such claims because (a) these claims would rarely be successful\n\ndue to jury hostility, and (b) Fourth Amendment interests rank highly on\n\f                                    17\n\na “scale of social values” compared to other interests which are already\n\nprotected by the availability of an action for damages. Id. at 402–11, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2008–12.\n\n      A few years after Bivens, the Supreme Court held that a woman\n\nwho alleged she had been discriminated against on the basis of sex by a\n\ncongressman had a cause of action for damages under the Fifth\n\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause and its equal protection component.\n\nPassman, 442 U.S. at 248, 99 S. Ct. at 2279.        After determining the\n\nplaintiff had a protected right to be free of sexual discrimination under\n\nthe Fifth Amendment, the Passman Court next asked whether there were\n\nany special factors counseling hesitation such that a Bivens remedy for\n\ndamages should not be granted without Congressional authorization. Id.\n\nat 245, 99 S. Ct. at 2277.\n\n      To answer whether there were “special factors” counseling\n\nhesitation, the Passman Court reviewed considerations addressed by the\n\nBivens majority and Justice Harlan’s concurrence in Bivens. Id. at 245–\n\n48, 99 S. Ct. at 2277–79.      First, the Court found damages are an\n\nappropriate remedy for due process and equal protection violations\n\nbecause, as described in Bivens, damages are the ordinary remedy for\n\ninvasion of “personal interests in liberty.” Id. at 245, 99 S. Ct. at 2277\n\n(quoting Bivens, 403 U.S. at 395, 91 S. Ct. at 2004 (majority opinion)).\n\nAdditionally, the Court reasoned that courts will not encounter difficulty\n\nin measuring damages due to the experience that courts have in\n\nevaluating claims for back pay as a result of sex discrimination.      Id.\n\nMoreover, according to the Court, equitable relief would not make the\n\nplaintiff whole. Id. In a statement that has become epigrammatic, the\n\nCourt noted “it is damages or nothing.” Id. (quoting Bivens, 403 U.S. at\n\n410, 91 S. Ct. at 2012 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\f                                          18\n\n      Second,     the   Passman     Court      noted   that    a   suit    against   a\n\ncongressman does raise special concerns counseling hesitation.                  Id. at\n\n246, 99 S. Ct. at 2277.        These special concerns, however, should be\n\naddressed by reference to the Speech or Debate Clause, which provides\n\nprinciples for determining when a congressman is not acting as a\n\ncongressman but as an ordinary employer. Id.; see U.S. Const. art. I,\n\n§ 6, cl. 1. The Court further explained that congressmen are not above\n\nthe law. Passman, 442 U.S. at 246, 99 S. Ct. at 2277. Therefore, the\n\nCourt held, if the congressman’s actions were not shielded by the Speech\n\nor Debate Clause, then the plaintiff’s suit could go forward. Id.\n\n      Third, the Passman Court found that Congress had not explicitly\n\ndeclared that a suit for damages is not available in a federal employment\n\ndiscrimination case. Id. at 246–47, 99 S. Ct. at 2278. The Court found\n\nno evidence that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was intended to\n\nforeclose alternative remedies. Id. at 247, 99 S. Ct. at 2278.\n\n      Fourth, and finally, the Passman Court did not perceive the\n\npotential for a “deluge” of federal claims if a Bivens claim were allowed.\n\nId. at 248, 99 S. Ct. at 2278. For one thing, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 already\n\nexisted to provide recovery for plaintiffs when the injuries occurred under\n\ncolor of state law. Id. The Court reasoned that not every tort committed\n\nby a federal official would represent a constitutional violation—the\n\nnecessity of first demonstrating a violation of constitutional rights is a\n\nsignificant hurdle that few plaintiffs could successfully vault. Id.\n\n      The Passman Court concluded by noting that if Congress created\n\nan   equally    effective   alternative    remedy,     the    need   for    a   direct\n\nconstitutional action for damages “might be obviated.” Id. The Court,\n\nhowever, seemed to stress the “might” by quoting Justice Harlan’s\n\nBivens’s concurrence,\n\f                                     19\n      Judicial resources, I am well aware, are increasingly scarce\n      these days. Nonetheless, when we automatically close the\n      courthouse door solely on this basis, we implicitly express a\n      value judgment on the comparative importance of classes of\n      legally protected interests. And current limitations upon the\n      effective functioning of the courts arising from budgetary\n      inadequacies should not be permitted to stand in the way of\n      the recognition of otherwise sound constitutional principles.\n\nId. at 248, 99 S. Ct. at 2278–79 (quoting Bivens, 403 U.S. at 411, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2012).\n\n      In addition to Bivens and Passman, the Supreme Court heard a\n\nthird case in which the issue of the validity of a constitutional action for\ndamages was squarely before the Court. In Carlson, the Supreme Court\n\nrecognized a Bivens action in the case of a mother who sued on behalf of\n\nher son who, she alleged, suffered injuries and died in federal prison in\n\nviolation of his due process, equal protection, and Eighth Amendment\n\nrights. 446 U.S. at 16, 100 S. Ct. at 1470.\n\n      The Carlson Court explained that when a plaintiff shows they were\n\ninjured by a federal agent’s constitutional violations, the plaintiff has a\n\nright to recover damages except when (1) there are “special factors\n\ncounseling hesitation in the absence of [an] affirmative action by\n\nCongress,” or (2) Congress has already “provided an alternate remedy\n\nwhich it explicitly declared to be a substitute for a recovery directly under\n\nthe Constitution and viewed as equally effective.” Id. at 18–19, 100 S. Ct.\n\nat 1471.    The Court found no special factors counseling hesitation\n\nbecause federal prison officials “do not enjoy such independent status in\n\nour constitutional scheme as to suggest that judicially created remedies\n\nagainst them might be inappropriate.” Id. at 19, 100 S. Ct. at 1472.\n\n      The Carlson Court next looked at the Federal Tort Claims Act to\n\nsee if the Act was intended to be a substitute for recovery under the\n\nConstitution. Id. The Court held that it was not so intended, finding\n\f                                     20\n\nnothing in its legislative history to show either intent to preempt a Bivens\n\nremedy or to create an equally effective remedy for a constitutional\n\nviolation. Id. Additionally, the Court found that a Bivens remedy is more\n\neffective than a remedy under the Federal Tort Claims Act because a\n\nBivens remedy is recoverable against individuals and thus serves a\n\ndeterrent purpose because individual federal officers face personal\n\nfinancial liability.   Id. at 20–21, 100 S. Ct. at 1472–73.    Further, the\n\nCourt reasoned that availability of punitive damages for a Bivens action\n\nmeans the constitutional action is more effective than the statutory\n\naction, in which punitive damages are prohibited. Id. at 22, 100 S. Ct. at\n\n1473. The Court concluded that plainly the Federal Tort Claims Act “is\n\nnot a sufficient protector of the citizens’ constitutional rights, and\n\nwithout a clear congressional mandate we cannot hold that Congress\n\nrelegated respondent exclusively to the FTCA remedy.”         Id. at 23, 100\n\nS. Ct. at 1474.\n\n      The parties have provided laundry lists of United States Supreme\n\nCourt cases which they claim either support the continuing viability of\n\nBivens claims or show federal hostility to such claims. The defendants\n\ndirect our attention to the following cases which they claim show the\n\nSupreme Court no longer favors such claims. See Minneci v. Pollard, 565\n\nU.S. 118, 131, 132 S. Ct. 617, 626 (2012) (declining to recognize a\n\nBivens action against individual private employers running a federal\n\nprison); Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537, 549–62, 127 S. Ct. 2588, 2597–\n\n605 (2007) (denying a Bivens Fourth and Fifth Amendment claim based\n\non Bureau of Land Management extortion because plaintiff had ample\n\nother remedies and because claims in the case were ill-suited for\n\njudicially crafted relief); Corr. Servs. Corp, 534 U.S. at 66, 74, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 519, 523 (describing the holding of Bivens as “limited” and declining to\n\f                                      21\n\nallow a damages action against private corporations acting under color of\n\nfederal law for a constitutional deprivation); Chappell, 462 U.S. at 300,\n\n103 S. Ct. at 2365–66 (finding special factors counseling hesitation due\n\nto the unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment in a\n\nmilitary race discrimination case).\n\n      In response, Godfrey cites a collection of cases that he claims cite\n\nBivens and support its continued vitality. See, e.g., Groh v. Ramirez, 540\n\nU.S. 551, 555, 124 S. Ct. 1284, 1288–89 (2004) (involving a Bivens\n\naction for violation of the Fourth Amendment); Farmer v. Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. 825, 830, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1975 (1994) (concerning a Bivens action\n\nfor violation of the Eighth Amendment); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511,\n\n515, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 2809 (1985) (presenting a Bivens action for\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment from wiretapping); Harlow v.\n\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 805, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 2731 (1982) (underlying\n\nsuit involved Bivens claims); Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 482–83, 98\n\nS. Ct. 2894, 2898 (1978) (underlying suit involved Bivens claims).\n\n      It is no great surprise that, in the years since Bivens, the Court\n\nhas been cautious about expanding its Bivens holding, and in some\n\ncases has retreated from the scope of its holding. See Vicki C. Jackson,\n\nSuing the Federal Government: Sovereignty, Immunity, and Judicial\n\nIndependence, 35 Geo. Wash. Int’l L. Rev. 521, 566–67 (2003); see also\n\nZiglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. ___, ___, ___ S. Ct. ___, ___, 2017 WL 2621317,\n\nat *12 (2017) (“[T]he Court has made clear that expanding the Bivens\n\nremedy is now a ‘disfavored’ judicial activity.”). Many cases appearing to\n\ngrant potentially expansive rights from the Warren and Burger Courts\n\nhave been limited or contained. See Nelson Lund, The Rehnquist Court’s\n\nPragmatic Approach to Civil Rights, 99 Nw. U. L. Rev. 249, 288 (2004); see\n\ngenerally Ronald Kahn, The Supreme Court as a (Counter) Majoritarian\n\f                                    22\n\nInstitution: Misperceptions of the Warren, Burger, and Rehnquist Courts,\n\n1994 Det. C.L. Rev. 1, 5–6 (1994).       But because we do not march in\n\nlockstep with federal law, the continuing viability of federal Bivens claims\n\nwould be important only if later cases cast doubt on the reasoning of the\n\noriginal opinion.\n\n      Further, as noted by the New York Court of Appeals, the “concerns\n\nof federalism underlie much of the Supreme Court’s reluctance to expand\n\nrelief available . . . and thereby unduly interfere with States’ rights.”\n\nBrown v. State, 674 N.E.2d 1129, 1143 (N.Y. 1996) (discussing actions\n\nunder § 1983); see also Jennifer Friesen, Recovering Damages for State\n\nBills of Rights Claims, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 1269, 1275 (1985) (stressing state\n\njudges should not be affected by need of federal courts to make\n\nnationally uniform rules); Gary S. Gilden, Redressing Deprivations of\n\nRights Secured by State Constitutions Outside the Shadow of the Supreme\n\nCourt’s Constitutional Remedies Jurisprudence, 115 Penn. St. L. Rev. 877,\n\n882 (2011) (“[I]t is well settled that the Supreme Court is constrained by\n\nfederalism when asked to recognize a right under the United States\n\nConstitution. . . .   However, concerns over federal incursion on the\n\nprerogative of the states do not exist when a state court enforces the\n\nguarantees of the state’s own constitution.”).           We have no such\n\nfederalism concerns to dilute our approach to judicially enforceable\n\nindividual rights provisions of the Iowa Constitution.\n\n      In any event, a review of the caselaw since Bivens does not show a\n\nretreat from Bivens reasoning as applied to situations like Godfrey’s.\n\nRather, the cases show an unwillingness to expand Bivens claims beyond\n\nthe Fourth Amendment circumstances in Bivens itself, the due\n\nprocess/equal protection/cruel and unusual punishment federal prison\n\ncontext in Carlson, and the due process/equal protection employment\n\f                                   23\n\ndiscrimination context in Passman.      Had cases since Passman and\n\nCarlson weakened these cases’ holdings or cast doubt on their reasoning,\n\nthis information would be important in our determination of their\n\npersuasive value.   As it is, Bivens, Carlson, and Passman remain to\n\npersuade us or fail to persuade on their own terms.\n\n      A final federal case of note comes from the United States District\n\nCourt for the Northern District of Iowa which held a Bivens claim would\n\nbe recognized under Iowa law. McCabe v. Macaulay, 551 F. Supp. 2d\n\n771, 785 (N.D. Iowa 2007).     In McCabe, the plaintiffs brought Bivens\n\nactions against the defendants, who were state police officers, under both\n\nthe Federal and State Constitutions, arguing that we would recognize a\n\nBivens action under the Iowa Constitution.       Id. at 784.   The court\n\ndiscussed our holding in Cunha v. City of Algona, 334 N.W.2d 591 (Iowa\n\n1983), in which we rejected a Bivens action against a municipal\n\ngovernment. McCabe, 551 F. Supp. 2d at 784. The federal district court\n\nexplained that McCabe was distinguishable from Cunha, stating,\n\n      At most, Cunha rejects a direct cause of action under the\n      due process clause of the Iowa Constitution for monetary\n      damages against a local governmental entity for reasons\n      expressed in Monell [v. Department of Social Services, 436\n      U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018 (1978), a United States Supreme\n      Court case extending § 1983 liability to local governments].\n      It does not address whether there is an Iowa analogue to\n      Bivens under the common law when, as here, Iowa\n      government officials are alleged to have violated the Iowa\n      Constitution and the Iowa General Assembly has not\n      specifically provided a statutory remedy for such violations.\n\nId. at 785.   The federal district court predicted that we would be\n\npersuaded by Bivens and the state courts that have accepted Bivens\n\nclaims under their state constitutions and recognize a Bivens claim\n\nunder the Iowa Constitution. Id.; see Dorwart v. Caraway, 58 P.3d 128,\n\n133–36 (Mont. 2002). Another federal district court agreed with McCabe\n\f                                           24\n\nthat we would recognize a Bivens action under the Iowa Constitution in\n\nPeters v. Woodbury County, 979 F. Supp. 2d 901, 971 (N.D. Iowa 2013).\n\n       C.

Introduction.       Many other state appellate courts have had\n\noccasion to determine whether constitutional provisions in their state\n\nconstitutions are self-executing for purposes of claims for money\n\ndamages.      See Dorwart, 58 P.3d at 133 & n.1 (listing states that had\n\nrecognized an implied cause of action as of 2002); Sharon N. Humble,\n\nAnnotation, Implied Cause of Action for Damages for Violation of\n\nProvisions of State Constitutions, 75 A.L.R. 5th 619, 624–28 (2000). The\n\nstates that have considered the issue are nearly equally divided in\n\nwhether to recognize implied constitutional actions for damages 2 or\n\nwhether to decline to recognize such actions. 3\n\n       2Gay    Law Students Ass’n v.

Overview       of   state    supreme      court   cases     holding     state\n\nconstitutional provisions self-executing for purposes of money damages.\n\nAmong the better reasoned state supreme court decisions interpreting\n\nwhether state constitutional provisions are self-executing for purposes of\n\nmonetary damages are Dorwart, 58 P.3d 128; Brown, 674 N.E.2d 1129;\n\nand Corum v. University of North Carolina, 413 S.E.2d 276 (N.C. 1992).\n\n       In Brown, claimants brought a class action against the State of\n\nNew York and other defendants for violating their rights to be free of\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures and to equal protection under the\n\nNew York Bill of Rights. 674 N.E.2d at 1131. The claims arose out of an\n\nincident in which every nonwhite male encountered by police during a\n\nfive-day “street sweep” was stopped, interrogated, and had their hands\n\nand forearms inspected by the police after a white woman reported that a\n\nblack male robbed her at knife point. Id. at 1131–32.                 The claimants\n\nasked the Court of Appeals of New York to recognize the action, which\n\nthe court called a “constitutional tort”—a cause of action for damages\n\nunder the constitution.          Id. at 1132–33 (citing Bivens as well as\n\nCalifornia, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Illinois cases recognizing state\n\nconstitutional actions for damages).\n\n\n________________________\nA.2d 580, 587 (R.I. 1998) (declining to find that a victims’ rights amendment to the\nstate constitution was self-executing); Lee v. Ladd, 834 S.W.2d 323, 325 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n1992) (summarily noting that Tennessee courts do not recognize state Bivens actions);\nSpackman ex rel. Spackman v. Bd. of Educ. of Box Elder Cty. Sch. Dist., 16 P.3d 533, 538\n(Utah 2000) (limiting Bott v. DeLand, 922 P.2d 732, 739 (Utah 1996), which recognized\na state Bivens action for cruel and unusual punishment violations); Gray v. Rhoads, 55\nVa. Cir. 362, at *6–8 (Va. Cir. Ct. 2001) (predicting Virginia Supreme Court would\ndecline to allow Bivens causes of action under state constitution and additionally\nfinding adequate alternative remedies). But see Smith v. Arthur C. Baue Funeral Home,\n370 S.W.2d 249, 254 (Mo. 1963) (pre-Bivens case summarily recognizing implied action\nfor damages under state constitution provision ensuring the right to collectively\nbargain).\n\f                                           27\n\n       The Brown court began its analysis by recognizing that New York\n\nlacked a statute authorizing damages for violations of constitutional\n\nrights, unlike 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Id. at 1137. If any damages remedy\n\nexisted, therefore, it must be implied. Id. The court recognized, however,\n\nthat the state constitutional provision must be self-executing in order for\n\na court to imply an action for damages. Id. Here, the court explained,\n\nthe rights to equal protection and to be free of unreasonable searches\n\nand seizures were self-executing. Id.\n\n       Surveying the caselaw from other states, the Brown court\n\ndetermined that, when state courts imply actions for damages under\n\ntheir constitutions, they do so based on either (1) the reasoning in the\n\nRestatement (Second) section 874A, (2) by analogy to Bivens, (3) common\n\nlaw predecessors of the constitutional provision at issue, or (4) a\n\ncombination of the previous three. Id. at 1138; 4 see Widgeon, 479 A.2d\n\nat 923–24 (justifying an implied action for damages under the Maryland\n\nConstitution almost entirely based on common law predecessors—\n\n\n       4As described above, the Restatement (Second) states that when a statute or\n\nconstitutional provision protects a class of person by mandating or prohibiting certain\nconduct but does not provide for a civil remedy for a violation, a court may provide an\ninjured member of the class with a right of action in tort if the court determines that the\nremedy furthers the purpose or is needed to ensure the effectiveness of the provision.\nRestatement (Second) § 874A & cmt. a, at 301; see Brown, 674 N.E.2d at 1138. The\nNew York Court of Appeals also noted that many state courts rely on the reasoning of\nBivens. Brown, 674 N.E.2d at 1138.\n       The underlying rationale for the decision, in simplest terms, in that\n       constitutional guarantees are worthy of protection on their own terms\n       without being linked to some common-law or statutory tort, and that the\n       courts have the obligation to enforce these rights by ensuring that each\n       individual receives an adequate remedy for the violation of a\n       constitutional duty.\nId. If the government fails to provide such a remedy, the courts must provide it\nthemselves. Id. The court explained that both Bivens and the Restatement (Second)\nsupport one another and cited a number of state court decisions that have recognized\nthese principles and applied them to their own constitutions. Id.\n\f                                      28\n\nspecifically a trespass action for violation of right to be free of\n\nunreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by the Magna Carta).\n\n      The Brown court also explained that the 1777 New York\n\nConstitution’s provisions on equal protection and search and seizure are\n\nboth based on older, common law antecedents—in the case of\n\nunreasonable search and seizure all the way back to the Magna Carta.\n\nId. at 1138–39.       The availability of these common law antecedents\n\nsupports the position that the framers of the constitution anticipated\n\nthat such actions would remain available under the constitution. Id. at\n\n1139. Additionally, the recorded debates of the New York Constitutional\n\nConvention of 1938 and contemporaneous cases show the delegates\n\nassumed that victims of unconstitutional actions could sue for damages.\n\nId.\n\n      The Brown court also held that implying a damages remedy is\n\nconsistent with the purposes of the constitutional provisions and is\n\n“necessary and appropriate to ensure the full realization of the rights\n\nthey state.”   Id.   These provisions clearly define duties for government\n\nofficers of the state. Id. at 1140. The abuses suffered by the claimants\n\nwere exactly the sort of abuses that these constitutional provisions were\n\ndesigned to prevent. Id. Damages, the court stressed, “are a necessary\n\ndeterrent for such misconduct. . . . [I]njunctive or declaratory relief [falls]\n\nshort.” Id. at 1141 (noting that because claimants were never charged\n\nwith a crime, excluding any evidence resulting from their interrogations\n\nserves no deterrent purpose). Further, damages have been historically\n\nrecognized as the appropriate remedy for invasions of personal liberties.\n\nId.\n\n      Thus, the Brown court held that the plaintiffs had an implied right\n\nof damages under the search and seizures and equal protection clauses\n\f                                    29\n\nof the New York Constitution.    Id.   A dissent argued the court lacked\n\njurisdiction based on article VI, section 9 (stating the court has\n\njurisdiction to hear such claims as the legislature may provide) of the\n\nNew York Constitution and that sovereign immunity protected the state.\n\nId. at 1145–48, 1152–54 (Bellacosa, J., dissenting). The dissent further\n\ncriticized equating constitutional damages actions with common law\n\ntorts. Id. at 1148–52; see Gail Donoghue & Jonathan I. Edelstein, Life\n\nAfter Brown: The Future of State Constitutional Tort Actions in New York,\n\n42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 447, 462–71 (1998) [hereinafter Donoghue]\n\n(describing the Brown opinion and the dissent).\n\n      In Corum, the Supreme Court of North Carolina held there was a\n\ndirect cause of action under the North Carolina Constitution for damages\n\nfor a violation of a plaintiff’s free speech rights.   413 S.E.2d at 292.\n\nCorum was a tenured professor at Appalachian State University who also\n\nheld the position of Dean of Learning Resources.       Id. at 280.   After a\n\ndispute with other university officials regarding the location of a library\n\ncollection, Corum was removed from his position as Dean, allegedly in\n\nretaliation for Corum’s vocal opposition to the move.       Id. at 281–82.\n\nCorum sought damages for violating North Carolina’s constitutional\n\nprovisions protecting the right to free speech, equal protection, and\n\n“fundamental principles” of liberty.     Id. at 280; see also Grant E.\n\nBuckner, North Carolina’s Declaration of Rights: Fertile Ground in a\n\nFederal Climate, 36 N.C. Cent. L. Rev. 145, 157, 163 n.98 (2014)\n\n(describing North Carolina’s protection of “fundamental principles” as a\n\nrich source of individual rights, including the right to earn a livelihood\n\nthrough lawful business).\n\n      The Corum court emphasized the primacy of the Declaration of\n\nRights in article I of the North Carolina Constitution. 413 S.E.2d at 290.\n\f                                    30\n\nAccording to the court, “The very purpose of the Declaration of Rights is\n\nto ensure that the violation of these rights is never permitted by anyone\n\nwho might be invested under the Constitution with the powers of the\n\nState.”   Id.   The court emphasized that “[w]e give our Constitution a\n\nliberal interpretation in favor of its citizens with respect to those\n\nprovisions which were designated to safeguard the liberty and security of\n\nthe citizens in regard to both person and property.” Id.\n\n      A third illustrative case is Dorwart, 58 P.3d 128.   In Dorwart, a\n\njudgment debtor sued a county sheriff and sheriff’s deputies following\n\nseizure of property alleging due process and search and seizure\n\nviolations under Federal and State Constitutions. Id. at 129–30. Law\n\nenforcement had writs of execution related to judgment indebtedness,\n\nbut claimed nonexistent authority to search Dorwart’s home. Id. at 130.\n\nThe Dorwart court held that the plaintiff had causes of action under the\n\nMontana Constitution for violation of the due process and search and\n\nseizure provisions. Id. at 137.\n\n      The Dorwart court began its analysis by reviewing Bivens,\n\nPassman, and Carlson. Id. at 133–36. The court noted in Bivens, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court had said “[h]istorically, damages have been\n\nregarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in\n\nliberty. . . . [F]ederal courts may use any available remedy to make good\n\nthe wrong done.” Id. at 135 (alterations in original) (quoting Bivens, 403\n\nU.S. at 395–96, 91 S. Ct. at 2004 (majority opinion)). The Dorwart court\n\nnoted that damage actions were endorsed by Restatement (Second)\n\nsection 874A.      Id.   The court cited various cases standing for the\n\nproposition that damage actions for violations of individual rights were\n\nrecognized under English common law.        Id. at 135–36; see Moresi v.\n\nState, 567 So. 2d 1081, 1092 (La. 1990); Widgeon, 479 A.2d at 924. The\n\f                                         31\n\ncourt rejected the argument that common law remedies were sufficient,\n\nnoting that common law causes of action intended to regulate the\n\nrelationships among and between individuals are not adequate to redress\n\nthe type of damage caused by the invasion of constitutional rights.\n\nDorwart, 58 P.3d at 137.\n\n      3. Overview of state supreme court cases rejecting view that state\n\nconstitutional provisions are self-executing.     Several cases illustrate the\n\nreasoning behind state supreme court cases which reject the notion that\n\nstate constitutional provisions are self-executing for purposes of actions\n\nfor money damages.\n\n      The Supreme Court of Oregon rejected a constitutionally based\n\nclaim for money damages in Hunter v. City of Eugene, 787 P.2d 881, 884\n\n(Or. 1990). In Hunter, striking teachers argued their state constitutional\n\nrights were violated by city employees.        Id. at 882.   The Oregon court\n\nrejected an action for money damages under the free speech provisions of\n\nthe Oregon Constitution.         Id. at 884.   The court stated it was “very\n\nreluctant to impose any civil responsibility in the form of damages for\n\nviolation of such a right, absent specific legislation or clear legislative\n\nintent.”   Id. at 883.   The court declared that “Oregon’s Bill of Rights\n\nprovides no textual or historical basis for implying a right to damages for\n\nconstitutional violations.”      Id.   Lacking legislative guidance, the court\n\nobserved “this court is in a poor position to say what should or should\n\nnot be compensation for violation of a state constitutional right and what\n\nlimitations on liability should be imposed.” Id. at 884. The court noted\n\nthat federal legislation such as 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Federal Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964 provided at least some guidance for such claims on\n\nthe federal level. Id. at 883.\n\f                                    32\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court rejected an action for monetary damages\n\nunder the free speech and assembly clause of the Texas Constitution in\n\nCity of Beaumont v. Bouillion, 896 S.W.2d 143, 150 (Tex. 1995).        The\n\nBeaumont court emphasized cases which were decided based on the\n\npresence or absence of alternative remedial schemes. Id. at 147–48. The\n\ncourt noted that no one had presented evidence suggesting that at the\n\ntime the Texas Constitution was written, it was intended to provide an\n\nimplied right of damages for the violation of constitutional rights. Id. at\n\n148.    The court further emphasized the language of the Texas\n\nConstitution, which suggested that acts in violation of constitutional\n\nprovisions are void. Id. at 149.\n\n       The Colorado Supreme Court rejected a cause of action for money\n\ndamages under the due process clause of the Colorado Constitution in a\n\nreal estate zoning matter in Board of County Commissioners v. Sundheim,\n\n926 P.2d 545, 553 (Colo. 1996) (en banc).           The Sundheim court\n\nrecognized that the United States Supreme Court found a cause of action\n\nfor money damages in Bivens, but emphasized more recent Supreme\n\nCourt cases that have declined to extend Bivens to other factual\n\ncontexts. Id. at 551–52; see Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 390, 103 S. Ct.\n\n2404, 2417 (1983); Chappell, 462 U.S. at 305, 103 S. Ct. at 2368. While\n\nthe Sundheim court recognized there might be a state constitutional\n\ncause of action when there was no adequate remedy, it noted the\n\nlegislature had established a framework for challenging a zoning\n\nordinance. 926 P.2d at 553. As a result, the Sundheim court found it\n\nunnecessary to find a constitutionally based damage remedy in this case\n\nbut did not necessarily rule it out under different circumstances. Id.; see\n\nalso Dick Fischer Dev. No. 2, Inc. v. Dep’t of Admin., 838 P.2d 263, 268\n\n(Alaska 1992) (denying damages for due process violation when other\n\f                                    33\n\nadministrative remedies available); Rockhouse Mountain Prop. Owners\n\nAss’n, Inc. v. Town of Conway, 503 A.2d 1385, 1389 (N.H. 1986)\n\n(declining to find constitutional action for money damages under due\n\nprocess or equal protection provisions of state constitution when\n\nadministrative procedures available); Shields v. Gerhart, 658 A.2d 924,\n\n935–36 (Vt. 1995) (declining damages for free speech violation because of\n\nlegislatively created remedies); see also Lance R. Chism, Bivens-Type\n\nActions Under State Constitutions—Will Tennessee Give You a Remedy?,\n\n30 U. Mem. L. Rev. 409, 425 (2000) (noting states not finding an action\n\nfor damages usually rely on alternative legislative remedy).\n\n      D. Iowa Caselaw on Self-Executing Constitutional Claims. The\n\nIowa Supreme Court has a long and storied tradition of deciding cutting-\n\nedge cases well in advance of later decisions of the United States\n\nSupreme Court and other courts.       We were in advance of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court in In re Ralph, Morris 1, 6–7 (Iowa 1839), which\n\nrejected the approach later adopted by the United States Supreme Court\n\nin the infamous Dred Scott case. See Dred Scott v. Sanford, 60 U.S. 393,\n\n454 (1857), superseded by constitutional amendment, U.S. Const. amend.\n\nXIV. We advanced the cause of civil rights by refusing to countenance\n\nsegregation in education or public accommodations in Clark and Coger\n\nmany decades before the United States Supreme Court decided Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495, 74 S. Ct. 686, 692 (1954). See\n\nCoger v. Nw. Union Packet Co., 37 Iowa 145, 158 (1873); Clark v. Bd. of\n\nDirs., 24 Iowa 266, 277 (1868). We invalidated sodomy statutes early on\n\nin State v. Pilcher, 242 N.W.2d 348, 359 (Iowa 1976), and we recognized\n\ngay marriage rights in Varnum, 763 N.W.2d 862, 907, well in advance of\n\nthe United States Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, 576\n\nU.S. ___, ___, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2604–05 (2015).\n\f                                    34\n\n       Similarly, fifty years before the United States Supreme Court\n\ndecided Bivens, we decided several cases finding that the search and\n\nseizure clause of the Iowa Constitution supported an action for damages\n\nwithout implementing legislation.    In McClurg, we reversed a directed\n\nverdict in favor of the defendants on a claim for damages against an\n\nofficer who conducted a search without a warrant. 123 Iowa at 371, 98\n\nN.W. at 882. We emphasized,\n\n       The right of the citizen to occupy and enjoy his home,\n       however mean or humble, free from arbitrary invasion and\n       search, has for centuries been protected with the most\n       solicitous care by every court in the English-speaking world,\n       from Magna [Carta] down to the present, and is embodied in\n       every bill of rights defining the limits of governmental power\n       in our own republic.\n\nId.   The right to be free from arbitrary search and seizure, was also\n\nembraced in statute and in the common law. Id. at 372, 98 N.W. at 882.\n\n       We returned to the question of damages in the search and seizure\n\ncontext in Krehbiel v. Henkle, 142 Iowa 677, 121 N.W. 378 (1909). In\n\nKrehbiel, the court noted that the right of citizens to be secure in person\nand property against wrongful seizures and searches is “zealously\n\nsafeguarded and has express recognition in our State Constitution.” Id.\n\nat 679–80, 121 N.W. at 379–80; see Iowa Const. art. I, § 8. The court\n\ndeclared it was “thoroughly well settled” that “a violation of this right\n\nwithout reasonable ground therefor gives the injured party a right of\n\naction.” Krehbiel, 142 Iowa at 680, 121 N.W. at 380. In an appeal of the\n\ncase, the court affirmed an award of punitive damages in an unspecified\n\namount, noting that such damages were available for conduct that was\n\n“wanton and reckless, and in disregard of the plaintiff’s rights.” Krehbiel\n\nv. Henkle, 152 Iowa 604, 606, 129 N.W. 945, 945 (1911).\n\f                                     35\n\n      We considered the thoroughly well settled principle that violation of\n\narticle I, section 8 gives rise to a cause of action in State v. Tonn, 195\n\nIowa 94, 191 N.W. 530 (1923), abrogated by State v. Cline, 617 N.W.2d\n\n277, 291 (Iowa 2000).     In Tonn, we rejected the exclusionary rule for\n\nsearch and seizure violations. Id. at 107, 191 N.W. at 536. The court in\n\nTonn, however, emphasized the rejection “would not detract one iota from\n\nthe full protection vouchsafed to the citizen by the constitutional\n\nprovisions,” observing, “[a] trespassing officer is liable for all wrong done\n\nin an illegal search or seizure.” Id. at 106, 191 N.W. at 535. We further\n\nsaid the right against unreasonable searches and seizures was “a sacred\n\nright, and one which the courts will rigidly enforce.” Id.\n\n      McClurg and Krehbiel were cited with approval in Girard, 219 Iowa\n\nat 148, 257 N.W. at 403. In Girard, consistent with the thoroughly well\n\nsettled principle of our prior cases, we straightforwardly declared, “[a]\n\nviolation of the state and federal constitutional provisions against the\n\nunreasonable invasion of a person’s home gives the injured party a right\n\nof action for damages for unlawful breaking and entering.” Id. Thus, a\n\ndamages action for constitutional violations of search and seizure under\n\nthe Iowa Constitution was thoroughly well settled in Iowa law decades\n\nbefore the United States Supreme Court embraced the same concept in\n\nBivens. See Krehbiel, 142 Iowa at 680, 121 N.W. at 380.\n\n      While we held that search and seizure provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are self-executing in Girard, we came to a different\n\nconclusion on article IV, section 10 of the Iowa Constitution regarding\n\nthe holding of elections to fill vacancies for office. In Claussen, we came\n\nto the commonsense conclusion that this provision was not self-\n\nexecuting.   216 Iowa at 1091, 250 N.W. at 200.          The constitutional\n\nprovision itself failed to provide the necessarily detailed framework for\n\f                                       36\n\nimplementing elections, referring to situations which occurred when “no\n\nmode is provided by the Constitution and laws for filling such vacancy”\n\nin offices.   Id. at 1083, 250 N.W. at 197 (quoting Iowa Const. art. IV,\n\n§ 10).    If the vacancy were to be filled by “election of the people,” the\n\nGeneral Assembly had to provide the machinery for the election. Id. at\n\n1090, 250 N.W. at 200. The Iowa Supreme Court thus did not have the\n\nlegislative power to create the framework for a special election in the\n\nabsence of actions by other branches of government. Id. at 1091, 250\n\nN.W. at 200.\n\n         In Pierce, we considered a mandamus claim to require the Iowa tax\n\ncommission to meet and exercise its power to fairly apportion taxes. 229\n\nIowa at 24–26, 294 N.W. at 241–42. In passing, we stated the uniformity\n\nprovisions of the Iowa Constitution “are not self-executing, but require\n\nlegislative action to make them effective.” Id. at 29, 294 N.W. at 243. In\n\ncontext, however, the legislative action required referred to implementing\n\nlegislation to establish the machinery necessary to levy taxes. See id. It\n\ndid not relate to the question of whether a damage remedy could arise\n\nwhen the implementation of the uniformity provision by the state violated\n\nthe uniformity clause.       See id.   Indeed, there is language in Pierce\n\nsupportive of Godfrey’s position—\n\n         [W]here the law imposes a duty upon a state officer and his\n         refusal or failure to perform it affects injuriously . . . the\n         personal or property right of an individual, it cannot be that\n         the court is without power or authority to administer an\n         appropriate remedy.\n\nId. at 32, 294 N.W. at 245 (quoting McKeown v. Brown, 167 Iowa 489,\n\n498, 149 N.W. 593, 596 (1914)).\n\n         The next case of interest is Cunha, 334 N.W.2d 591. In that case,\n\na former prisoner sued Kossuth County for a due process violation. Id.\n\f                                   37\n\nat 592–93. We held the plaintiff failed to state a claim on which relief\n\ncould be granted. Id. at 595. Cunha was narrowly interpreted by the\n\nfederal district court in McCabe, which regarded its holding as limited to\n\nthe question of whether a money damages remedy was available against\n\nlocal government and did not have anything to do with potential\n\nindividual liability. McCabe, 551 F. Supp. 2d at 785. In short, Cunha is\n\nsimilar to Meyer, where the Supreme Court declined to allow an action\n\nagainst a government agency on the ground there would no longer be a\n\nreason to bring actions against individual officers. See Meyer, 510 U.S.\n\nat 485, 114 S. Ct. at 1005.\n\n       Finally, in Van Baale, a terminated police officer sought to avoid\n\nthe limitations on remedies provided by a civil service commission ruling\n\nby bringing an action for money damages alleging a violation of equal\n\nprotection. 550 N.W.2d at 155. The plaintiff, however, failed to identify\n\nany group of persons who were treated differently by the defendants, and\n\nas a result, the equal protection claim failed as a matter of law. Id. at\n\n157.   We said, in dicta, that the equal protection clause was not self-\n\nenforcing, citing Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 648, 86 S. Ct.\n\n1717, 1722 (1966).     Van Baale, 550 N.W.2d at 157.         Katzenbach,\n\nhowever, involved a very different question than whether any provisions\n\nof a constitution were self-enforcing.        Instead, the question in\n\nKatzenbach was whether congressional power to implement the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was coextensive with\n\njudicial interpretation of the Clause or whether Congress possessed\n\nbroader power to extend remedies and protections than the Supreme\n\nCourt might employ in the absence of congressional legislation. See 384\n\nU.S. at 649, 86 S. Ct. at 1722. The question in Katzenbach had nothing\n\nto do with stand-alone judicial power under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\f                                   38\n\nSee id. And, the Supreme Court ultimately addressed the very issue in\n\nPassman, a case not cited by Van Baale, and came to the opposite\n\nconclusion. See Passman, 442 U.S. at 248–49, 99 S. Ct. at 2279.\n\n      E. Discussion.\n\n      1. Iowa constitutional tradition.   We begin our discussion by\n\nemphasizing the importance of the Bill of Rights in our scheme of\n\ngovernment.      Unlike the federal constitutional framers who did not\n\noriginally include a bill of rights and ultimately tacked them on as\n\namendments to the United States Constitution, the framers of the Iowa\n\nConstitution put the Bill of Rights in the very first article.   See Iowa\n\nConst. art. I.    Further, the record of the 1857 Iowa Constitutional\n\nConvention reflects a desire of its members\n\n      to put upon record every guarantee that could be legitimately\n      placed [in the constitution] in order that Iowa not only might\n      be the first State in the Union, unquestionably as she is in\n      many respects, but that she might also have the best and\n      most clearly defined Bill of Rights.\n\n      1 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Iowa\n\n100 (W. Blair Lord rep. 1867), http://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/\n\nservices/collections/law-library/iaconst. And, as noted by George Ells,\nChair of the Committee on the Preamble and Bill of Rights, “the Bill of\n\nRights is of more importance than all the other clauses in the\n\nConstitution put together, because it is the foundation and written\n\nsecurity upon which the people rest their rights.” Id. at 103; see Short,\n\n851 N.W.2d at 482.\n\n      While citation to a state motto may seem like parochial legal\n\nboosterism, the early Iowa legislature adopted a distinctly libertarian\n\nstate motto: “Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.”\n\nIowa Code § 1A.1.      Our founders did not cringe at the thought of\n\f                                      39\n\nindividual rights and liberties—they embraced them.            “It would be\n\nincongruous to hold that our constitution is a drier source of private\n\nrights than the federal constitution.” Kelley Prop. Dev., Inc. v. Town of\n\nLebanon, 627 A.2d 909, 924 (Conn. 1993) (Borden, J., dissenting);\n\nCorum, 413 S.E.2d at 290 (emphasizing the “primacy of the Declaration\n\n[of Rights] in the minds of the framers” and that “[t]he very purpose of\n\nthe Declaration of Rights is to ensure that the violation of these rights is\n\nnever permitted by anyone who might be invested under the Constitution\n\nwith the powers of the State”). In Bivens, Justice Harlan declared that\n\nthe Bill of Rights was “intended to vindicate the interests of the\n\nindividual in the face of the popular will as expressed in legislative\n\nmajorities.” 403 U.S. at 407, 91 S. Ct. at 2010 (Harlan, J., concurring).\n\nAs further noted by Justice Harlan,\n\n      I do not think that the fact that the interest is protected by\n      the Constitution rather than statute or common law justifies\n      the assertion that federal courts are powerless to grant\n      damages in the absence of explicit congressional action\n      authorizing the remedy.\n\nId. at 403, 91 S. Ct. at 2008.\n\n      The view was well expressed by Chief Justice Hughes of the New\nJersey Supreme Court several decades ago—“Just as the Legislature\n\ncannot abridge constitutional rights by its enactments, it cannot curtail\n\nthem through its silence, and the judicial obligation to protect the\n\nfundamental rights of individuals is as old as this country.” King v. S.\n\nJersey Nat’l Bank, 330 A.2d 1, 10 (N.J. 1974).\n\n      We agree with Justice Harlan and Chief Justice Hughes. If these\n\nindividual rights in the very first article of the Iowa Constitution are to be\n\nmeaningful, they must be effectively enforced. That is the point Justice\n\nHarlan made with such clarity in Bivens. According to Justice Harlan,\n\f                                       40\n\n“the judiciary has a particular responsibility to assure the vindication of\n\nconstitutional interests.” Bivens, 403 U.S. at 407, 91 S. Ct. at 2010. It\n\nwould be ironic indeed if the enforcement of individual rights and\n\nliberties in the Iowa Constitution, designed to ensure that basic rights\n\nand liberties were immune from majoritarian impulses, were dependent\n\non legislative action for enforcement. It is the state judiciary that has the\n\nresponsibility to protect the state constitutional rights of the citizens.\n\nSee Corum, 413 S.E.2d at 290.\n\n      It should be noted that the Iowa Constitution of 1857 tended to\n\nlimit the power of the legislature while it protected the independence of\n\nthe court. The Constitution of 1846 provided that the legislature appoint\n\njustices to the supreme court, but the Constitution of 1857 shifted that\n\npower away from the legislature and vested it in the people. Compare\n\nIowa Const. art. V, §§ 3, 16 (1857), with Iowa Const. art. VI, § 3 (1846).\n\nFurther, the Iowa Constitution of 1857 reflected a healthy skepticism of\n\nlegislative power by structuring the legislative process by allowing only\n\none subject in an act and prohibiting special laws, prohibiting the\n\ncreation of corporations though special laws, prohibiting the state from\n\nbecoming a stockholder in corporations or from paying corporate debts\n\nor liabilities, providing express limitations on banking, and by a\n\nrequirement that school funds be held in a segregated account. See Iowa\n\nConst. art. III, §§ 29, 30 (1857); id. art. IV, §§ 1, 4–11; id. art. VII, § 1; id.\n\nart. VIII, §§ 1, 3; id. art. IX:2, § 3. This effort to control legislative action\n\ncontrasts with the declarations of the founders regarding the robust\n\ncharacter of the Bill of Rights.       See David Schuman, The Right to a\n\nRemedy, 65 Temp. L. Rev. 1197, 1200 (1992) (noting popular distrust\n\nshifted from the courts to the legislatures and thus a “second wave” of\n\nstate constitutions stripped “legislatures of many of their prerogatives\n\f                                     41\n\nand vest[ed] increased power in the judiciary”); G. Alan Tarr, Interpreting\n\nthe Separation of Powers in State Constitutions, 59 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am.\n\nL. 329, 335 (2003) (describing the 19th century trend toward limiting\n\nlegislative power).   We cannot imagine the founders intended to allow\n\ngovernment wrongdoers to set their own terms of accountability through\n\nlegislative action or inaction. See Susan Bandes, Reinventing Bivens: The\n\nSelf-Executing Constitution, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. 289, 340–42 (1995).\n\n      As a rhetorical device, the defendants suggest that Bivens claims\n\nfor Iowa constitutional violations amount to a “new cause of action.” But\n\nwe face an old problem, not a new problem. The old problem is whether\n\ncourts   have   the   power   to   provide   an   appropriate   remedy   for\n\nconstitutional wrongs.\n\n      The notion that unconstitutional actions by government officials\n\ncould lead to compensatory and exemplary damages was well established\n\nin English common law. In the highly publicized and notorious related\n\ncases of Wilkes v. Wood, (1763) 98 Eng. Rep. 489 (C.P.), and Huckle v.\n\nMoney, (1763) 95 Eng. Rep. 768 (C.P.), the English courts considered\n\ncases arising out of unlawful searches and seizures conducted by Lord\n\nHalifax in an attempt to uncover the publishers of a caustic tract critical\n\nof the government in a newspaper. See William W. Greenhalgh & Mark\n\nJ. Yost, In Defense of the “Per Se” Rule: Justice Stewart’s Struggle to\n\nPreserve the Fourth Amendment’s Warrant Clause, 31 Am. Crim. L. Rev.\n\n1013, 1025 (1994).       In these cases, the juries awarded substantial\n\ndamages of £ 1000 and £ 300 pounds respectively. Wilkes, 98 Eng. Rep.\n\nat 499; Huckle, 95 Eng. Rep. at 768.\n\n      In Wilkes, the plaintiff’s attorneys argued the actions of Halifax\n\nwere an “outrage” and “wound” on the constitution. William J. Cuddihy,\n\nThe Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning 602–1791 447\n\f                                      42\n\n(2009). The Wilkes court recognized the damages awarded by the jury\n\nexceeded the injury.    Wilkes, 98 Eng. Rep. at 498.          According to the\n\ncourt, however,\n\n      a jury have it in their power to give damages for more than\n      the injury received. Damages are designed not only as a\n      satisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as a\n      punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding\n      for the future, and as proof of the detestation of the jury to\n      the action itself.\n\nId. at 498–99.\n\n      In Huckle, the amount of damages awarded was fifteen times the\n\nactual damages. The Court of the King’s Bench declared,\n\n      [T]he personal injury done to [Huckle] was very small, so that\n      if the jury had been confined by their oath to consider the\n      mere personal injury only, perhaps [£] 20 damages would\n      have been thought damages sufficient; but the small injury\n      done to the plaintiff, or the inconsiderableness of his station\n      and rank in life did not appear to the jury in that striking\n      light in which the great point of law touching the liberty of\n      the subject appeared to them at the trial . . . . I think they\n      have done right in giving exemplary damages. To enter a\n      man’s house by virtue of a nameless warrant, in order to\n      procure evidence, is worse than the Spanish Inquisition; a\n      law under which no Englishman would wish to live an hour;\n      it was a most daring public attack made upon the liberty of\n      the subject.\n\nHuckle, 95 Eng. Rep. at 768–69.\n\n      Another     similar   English   case   arising   from    Lord   Halifax’s\n\nindiscriminate searches was Entick v. Carrington, (1765) 95 Eng. Rep.\n\n807 (C.P.), cited by the United States Supreme Court as a “monument of\n\nEnglish freedom” and considered to be “the true and ultimate expression\n\nof constitutional law.” Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 626, 6 S. Ct.\n\n524, 530 (1886), overruled in part on other grounds by Warden v. Hayden,\n\n387 U.S. 294, 302, 87 S. Ct. 1642, 1647–48 (1967). The jury returned a\n\nspecial verdict for Entick in the amount of £ 300 if the search was\n\f                                     43\n\nunlawful, a verdict which was affirmed by the court.        Entick, 95 Eng.\n\nRep. at 811, 818.     Entick has been referred to as “perhaps the most\n\nimportant of all constitutional law cases to be found in the law reports of\n\nEngland; for it gave security under the law to all who may be injured by\n\nthe torts of government servants.” E.C.S. Wade, Liability in Tort of the\n\nCentral Government of the United Kingdom, 29 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1416, 1416–\n\n17 (1954).   All told, in cases arising out of the illegal searches and\n\nseizures associated with Lord Halifax, a total of £ 5700 was paid, a\n\nsubstantial sum of money in those days.            George C. Thomas III,\n\nStumbling Toward History: The Framers’ Search and Seizure World, 43\n\nTexas Tech. L. Rev. 199, 213–14 (2010).\n\n      It is thus not surprising that Justice Harlan noted in Bivens that\n\n“[h]istorically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for\n\nan invasion of personal interests in liberty.” Bivens, 403 U.S. at 395, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2004; see also Widgeon, 479 A.2d at 924 (emphasizing\n\napplication of English precedents).        According to Justice Harlan,\n\ncontemporary modes of thought at the time of the United States\n\nConstitutional Convention reflected “modes of jurisprudential thought\n\nwhich appeared to link ‘rights’ and ‘remedies’ in a 1:1 correlation.”\n\nBivens, 403 U.S. at 400 n. 3, 91 S. Ct. at 2007 n.3; see John C. Jeffries,\n\nJr., Disaggregating Constitutional Torts, 110 Yale L.J. 259, 281 (2000)\n\n(“Rights cannot sensibly be crafted apart from remedies . . . .”).\n\n      Indeed, in one of our older precedents, we cited Entick using not\n\nonly a law book citation but a citation from Howell’s State Trials, a\n\npopular compendium of English state law cases. See Sanders v. State, 2\n\nIowa 230, 239 (1855). Thus, the territorial Supreme Court of Iowa was\n\nwell aware of the practice of English courts to award damages for\n\nconstitutional violations.   Older cases from other states suggest that\n\f                                     44\n\nstate courts contemporaneous with the Iowa Constitutional Convention\n\nwere well aware of search and seizure developments in England and\n\nassumed that the state constitutional founders were well aware, too.\n\nSee, e.g., Lincoln v. Smith, 27 Vt. 328, 346 (1855) (citing Entick and\n\ndeclaring the “controversy in England in relation to the validity of general\n\nwarrants was well understood by the framers of our state and United\n\nStates constitutions”); Fisher v. McGirr, 67 Mass. 1, 29 (1855) (stating\n\nissue of illegal searches and seizures “had been much discussed in\n\nEngland before the adoption of our constitution, and was probably well\n\nunderstood by its framers”).    Not surprisingly, there are a number of\n\nearly nineteenth century cases in which state courts imposed a damage\n\nremedy for constitutional violations, including punitive damages.      See,\n\ne.g., Grumon v. Raymond, 1 Conn. 40, 44 (1814) (“It would open a door\n\nfor the gratification of the most malignant passions, if [the issuance of a\n\ngeneral warrant] by a magistrate should s[c]reen him from damages.”);\n\nSimpson v. McCaffrey, 13 Ohio 508, 522 (1844) (en banc) (allowing\n\n“smart money,” which is “damages beyond compensation” for search and\n\nseizure violation); Jeffries v. Ankeny, 11 Ohio 372, 375 (1842) (permitting\n\ndamages for violation of right to vote). The notion that a constitutional\n\ntort is somehow a creature of the twentieth century is thus incorrect.\n\nJeremy M. Christiansen, State Search and Seizure: The Original Meaning,\n\n38 U. Haw. L. Rev. 63, 82–84 (2016) (citing cases showing between 1814\n\nand 1923 numerous states recognized constitutional torts).\n\n      Further,   in   the   common   law   regime,   remedies   at   law—or\n\ndamages—were usually the first choice to remedy a protected right. It is\n\nequitable remedies, not damage remedies, which reflected the innovation\n\nin the common law.      See Harold J. Berman, The Origins of Historical\n\nJurisprudence: Coke, Selden, Hale, 103 Yale L.J. 1651, 1687–88 (1994);\n\f                                      45\n\nThomas O. Main, Traditional Equity and Contemporary Procedure, 78\n\nWash. L. Rev. 429, 464–67 (2003). Equitable remedies were generally\n\nthought to be available only after legal remedies were demonstrated as\n\ninadequate. See Samuel L. Bray, The System of Equitable Remedies, 63\n\nUCLA L. Rev. 530, 545 (2016).\n\n      The defendants’ ahistorical argument is thus upside down.            The\n\navailability of damages at law is thus an ordinary remedy for violation of\n\nconstitutional provisions, not some new-fangled innovation.         “The very\n\nessence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to\n\nclaim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.”\n\nMarbury, 5 U.S. at 163. The real question is thus not whether a new\n\ncause of action is being created, but instead is whether the provision in\n\nquestion is self-executing, thereby putting a court in a position to award\n\ntraditional damages.\n\n      2. Impact of Iowa Constitution article XII, section 1.              Iowa\n\nConstitution article XII—the last article in the document—is entitled\n\n“Schedule.” Section 1 provides, “This constitution shall be the supreme\n\nlaw of the state, and any law inconsistent therewith, shall be void. The\n\ngeneral assembly shall pass all laws necessary to carry this constitution\n\ninto effect.” Iowa Const. art XII, § 1.\n\n      Notably, section 1 uses the term “this” twice. “This” constitution\n\n(and not any earlier constitution) shall be the supreme law of the State.\n\nAnd the general assembly shall pass all laws necessary to carry “this”\n\nconstitution into effect. The double use of the term “this” in section 1\n\nsuggests a focus on transition issues and not a fundamental reworking of\n\nthe power of courts to fashion remedies.\n\n      The sections that followed in Article XII generally, but not always,\n\nrelated to transition issues. Sections 2 through 14 of the original version\n\f                                     46\n\nof Article XII dealt with various proceedings, fines inuring to the state,\n\nbonds in force, elections of state officers, the meeting and makeup of the\n\ngeneral assembly, the crafting of judicial districts, the submission of the\n\nConstitution to the people for approval, an election to strike the word\n\n“white” from various provisions of the Constitution. See Iowa Const. art.\n\nXII, §§ 2–14 (1857 original); Benjamin F. Shambaugh, The Constitutions\n\nof Iowa 279–80 (1934) [hereinafter Shambaugh].         At the very end, an\n\nunusual provision was tacked on, declaring that unless otherwise\n\ndirected by law, “the County of Mills shall be part of the sixth Judicial\n\nDistrict of the State.” Iowa Const. art. XII, § 15; see Shambaugh, at 342.\n\nThis latter provision has nothing to do with transition, and looks like a\n\nspecial concession made to someone who was at the right place at the\n\nright time.\n\n      The defendants contend that the sentence in section 1 that\n\nprovides, “The general assembly shall pass all laws necessary to carry\n\nthis constitution into effect” means that the provisions of the Iowa Bill of\n\nRights in article I are not self-executing but require legislative action to\n\nbe enforced. See Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1. Godfrey, on the other hand,\n\ncontends that article XII, section 1 only requires the general assembly to\n\npass laws “necessary” to carry “this” constitution in effect.\n\n      On this point, we agree with Godfrey.       In context, we think the\n\nclear meaning of article XII, section 1 is to require the general assembly\n\nto put “this” new constitution into operation and to provide for the\n\ntransition from government under the prior constitution to the new\n\nregime.       The language in article I, section 1 was not meant to\n\ndramatically undermine effective judicial enforcement of the Iowa Bill of\n\nRights by making remedies dependent upon legislative whim.\n\f                                             47\n\n       Further,      a   survey     of   the    original    1857      Iowa    Constitution\n\ndemonstrates the framers knew how to use language that required the\n\ngeneral assembly to act. There are several provisions of the constitution\n\nthat expressly require the general assembly to take certain actions to\n\nimplement it. 5\n\n       Such requirements of action by the general assembly are notably\n\nabsent from the Bill of Rights of article I of the Iowa Constitution with\n\ntwo exceptions. The general assembly “may authorize” a jury of less than\n\ntwelve under article I, section 9. Iowa Const. art. I, § 9. Additionally, the\n\ngeneral assembly “may provide” that persons may be held to answer for a\n\ncriminal offense without the intervention of a grand jury. Id. art. I, § 11.\n\nBut other than these two provisions, nothing in the Iowa Bill of Rights\n\nrequires legislative action to ensure enforcement.\n\n       We think it clear that section 1 of the schedule article cannot\n\nswallow up the power of the judicial branch to craft remedies for\n\nconstitutional violations of article I. The rights established in the Iowa\n\nBill of Rights are not established by legislative grace, but by the people in\n\n        5For example, article III, sections 34 and 35 provided that the general assembly\n\nshall fix the number of senators “by law,” and shall “fix” the ratio of representatives.\nIowa Const. art. III, §§ 34 & 35. Article IV, section 5 stated the general assembly shall\nprovide for contested elections “in such manner as may be prescribed by law.” Id. art.\nIV, § 5. Article IV, section 16 declared the Governor may remit fines and forfeitures in\nsuch manner “as may be prescribed by law.” Id. art. IV, § 16. Article V, section 12\nstated the general assembly shall “provide, by law” for the election of an attorney\ngeneral. Id. art. V, § 12. Article V, section 14, declared it is “the duty of the General\nAssembly to provide for the carrying into effect of this [judicial] article.” Id. art. V, § 14.\nArticle V, section 6 declared district courts shall have jurisdiction “as shall be\nprescribed by law.” Id. art. V, § 6. Article VIII, section 1 declared the general assembly\n“shall provide, by general laws” for the organization of all corporations. Id. art. VIII, § 1.\nArticle IX, section 5 declared the general assembly “shall take measures for the\nprotection, improvement, or other disposition” of public land. Id. art. IX:2, § 5. Article\nIX, section 7 declared that school funds may be distributed “as may be provided by the\nGeneral Assembly.” Id. art. IX:2, § 7. Article X, section 1 stated the general assembly\n“shall provide by law” for the publication of proposed amendments to the constitution\nand the election of delegates to the constitutional convention. Id. art. X, § 1.\n\f                                            48\n\nadopting the constitution. The Iowa Bill of Rights was a big deal to the\n\nframers. We divine no desire of the 1857 framers to prevent the Iowa\n\njudiciary from performing its traditional role from a schedule article\n\nrequiring the general assembly to enact necessary laws for the transition\n\nto the new constitutional government. See State v. Buckner, 121 A.3d\n\n290, 298 (N.J. 2015) (noting a schedule article “contains various phase-\n\nin provisions designed to facilitate the smooth transition to the 1947\n\nconstitution and several subsequent amendments” (quoting Robert F.\n\nWilliams, The New Jersey State Constitution at 197 (2d ed. 2012)). The\n\nrights and remedies of the Bill of Rights are not subject to legislative\n\ndilution as “there is no elasticity in the specific guaranty of the\n\nConstitution.”       Des Moines Joint Stock Land Bank of Des Moines v.\n\nNordholm, 217 Iowa 1319, 1367, 253 N.W. 701, 725 (1934) (Claussen,\n\nC.J., dissenting).       It would be a remarkable development to allow a\n\nprovision in the schedule article of the Iowa Constitution to eviscerate\n\nthe power of courts to provide remedies for violations of the people’s\n\nrights established in article I, the article which the framers plainly\n\nthought, bar none, contained the most important provisions in the Iowa\n\nConstitution. 6\n\n\n\n       6A   leading commentator of the Iowa Constitution, Benjamin F. Shambaugh,\nnotes that the proposed Iowa Constitution of 1844 contained an article XIII, he\ndescribes as “a ‘Schedule’ for transition from Territorial to State organization.”\nShambaugh, at 153. Shambaugh further notes that the Iowa Constitution of 1846 also\nhad a schedule article, article XIII. Id. at 197. It provided that the Governor should\nproclaim the time to hold the first general election within three months of the\nconstitution’s adoption, the Governor should set the date of the first meeting of the\ngeneral assembly, and that the first general assembly must meet within four months of\nratification. Id. at 197–98. With respect to the Iowa Constitution of 1857, Shambaugh\nnotes that article XII, also entitled “Schedule,” provided for election of officers under the\nnew constitution, a provision for submitting the constitution to the people for\nratification, and a provision for an election to strike the word “white” from the article on\nthe Right of Suffrage. Id. at 279–80. Shambaugh does not suggest that any of these\n\f                                         49\n\n       3. Standard for determining self-execution.          The federal standard\n\nfor self-execution was described in Davis—\n\n       A constitutional provision may be said to be self-executing if\n       it supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right given\n       may be enjoyed and protected, . . . and it is not self-\n       executing when it merely indicates principles . . . .\n\n                 . . . In short, if [it is] complete in itself, it executes\n       itself.\n\n179 U.S. at 403, 21 S. Ct. at 212. Ordinarily, a self-executing provision\n\ndoes not contain a directive to the legislature for further action.\n\nConvention Ctr. Referendum Comm. v. Bd. of Elections & Ethics, 399 A.2d\n\n550, 552 (D.C. 1979). A provision is self-executing when it takes effect\n\nimmediately “without the necessity for supplementary or enabling\n\nlegislation.” Brown, 674 N.E.2d at 1137; see also Corum, 413 S.E.2d at\n\n289.\n\n       4. Application of self-execution standard to due process claims\n\ninvolving liberty and property interests. The United States Supreme Court\n\nconsidered whether claims under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution were enforceable in a\n\nBivens action in Passman, 442 U.S. at 230, 99 S. Ct. at 2269.                    The\n\nSupreme Court concluded that they were. Id. at 244, 99 S. Ct. at 2276.\n\nInstead of using the term “self-execution,” however, the Passman Court\n\nconsidered whether the plaintiff had a “cause of action,” due to how the\n\ncase was decided below and argued before the Court.                 Id. at 232, 99\n\nS. Ct. at 2270.        The Court concluded the ambiguous term “cause of\n\naction” meant, in Passman, whether the plaintiff had a judicially\n\nenforceable right under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\n________________________\n“Schedule” articles had dramatic implications for the scope of the rights and remedies\nestablished in article I of the any of the Iowa Constitutions.\n\f                                    50\n\na meaning essentially analogous to asking whether the Due Process\n\nClause was self-executing.    Id. at 239, 99 S. Ct. at 2274.    The Court\n\ndeclared that for the rights guaranteed in the Constitution to be more\n\nthan mere wishes or requests, litigants must be able to enforce those\n\nrights in the courts when there is no other effective means to enforce\n\nthem. Id. at 242, 99 S. Ct. at 2275. The Court explained it had long\n\nrecognized equal protection actions under the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFifth Amendment. Id.; see Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498–99, 74\n\nS. Ct. 693, 694 (1954).\n\n      A number of state supreme courts, both before and after Passman,\n\nhave come to the same conclusion, usually utilizing more conventional\n\nself-execution language. See Feldman v. City of Chicago, 2 N.E.2d 102,\n\n105 (Ill. 1936) (holding due process is self-executing and needs no\n\nstatutory enactment); Ashton v. Brown, 660 A.2d 447, 462 (Md. 1995);\n\nWidgeon, 479 A.2d at 923 n.5, 930; In re Wretlind, 32 N.W.2d 161, 167\n\n(Minn. 1948) (holding due process clause requires no legislation for\n\nenforcement); State v. Kyle, 65 S.W. 763, 767 (Mo. 1901) (due process\n\nclause is addressed to the courts, not the legislature); Dorwart, 58 P.3d\n\nat 136; Remley v State, 665 N.Y.S.2d 1005, 1008 (Ct. Cl. 1997) (holding\n\ndue process clause self-executing); see also Old Tuckaway Assocs. Ltd.\n\nP’ship v. City of Greenfield, 509 N.W.2d 323, 328, 330 (Wis. Ct. App.\n\n1993) (considering the merits of a direct due process claim).\n\n      We have found the due process clause of article I, section 9 of the\n\nIowa Constitution capable of enforcement in a number of settings that\n\ndid not involve damages. For instance, in Hensler v. City of Davenport,\n\nwe enforced the Iowa due process clause directly by finding that a\n\nprovision of a municipal ordinance which imposed a presumption of\n\nfailure to exercise reasonable parental control when a child is delinquent\n\f                                      51\n\nviolated a parent’s right to due process. 790 N.W.2d 569, 588–90 (Iowa\n\n2010). We have held that procedural due process must be afforded when\n\nan at-will public employee is discharged for reasons of dishonest,\n\nimmoral, or illegal conduct. Borschel v. City of Perry, 512 N.W.2d 565,\n\n568 (Iowa 1994).\n\n      In short, we have found the due process clause of article I, section\n\n9 enforceable in a wide variety of settings. Iowa courts have ensured, to\n\nuse Davis language, that “the right given may be enjoyed and protected.”\n\n179 U.S. at 403, 21 S. Ct. at 212.         The Iowa constitutional provision\n\nregarding due process of law is thus not a mere hortatory command, but\n\nit has been implemented, day in and day out, for many, many years. It\n\nhas traditionally been self-executing without remedial legislation for\n\nequitable purposes, and there is no reason to think it is not self-\n\nexecuting for the purposes of damages at law.\n\n      5. Application of self-executing standard to equal protection.        In\n\nPassman, the United States Supreme Court found that the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States\n\nConstitution was a self-executing provision sufficient to support a\n\nBivens-type direct damages action. 442 U.S. at 244, 99 S. Ct. at 2276.\n\nAccording to Passman, “the judiciary is clearly discernible as the primary\n\nmeans” through which the right to equal protection may be enforced. Id.\n\nat 241, 99 S. Ct. at 2275. The Passman Court quoted James Madison\n\nstating, when presenting the Bill of Rights to Congress, that when rights\n\nare incorporated into the Constitution, the judiciary will then consider\n\nthemselves the guardian of those rights and thus serve as “an\n\nimpenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the\n\nLegislative or Executive; [the judiciary] will be naturally led to resist every\n\nencroachment upon rights.” Id. at 241–42, 99 S. Ct. at 2275 (quoting 1\n\f                                       52\n\nAnnals of Congress 439 (1789)). The Equal Protection Clause was thus\n\nintended to be, and understood to be, enforceable by the judiciary. See\n\nid. at 244, 99 S. Ct. at 2276.\n\n      Similarly, in Brown, the Court of Appeals of New York held the New\n\nYork Constitution’s equal protection clause was self-executing.            674\n\nN.E.2d at 1137.     The Brown court explained that the right to equal\n\nprotection in the New York Constitution is “[m]anifestly” self-executing\n\nbecause it “define[s] judicially enforceable rights and provide[s] citizens\n\nwith a basis for judicial relief against the State if those rights are\n\nviolated.” Id. The equal protection provision “imposes a clear duty on\n\nthe State and its subdivisions to ensure that all persons in the same\n\ncircumstances receive the same treatment. Id. at 1140.\n\n      A number of other states have found the equal protection\n\nprovisions of state constitutions to be self-executing. See, e.g., State v.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Alaska, 35 P.3d 30, 44 (Alaska 2001) (considering\n\nmerits of direct equal protection claim); Unger v. Super. Ct., 692 P.2d\n\n238, 239–43 (Cal. 1984) (en banc) (considering merits of direct equal\n\nprotection claim); Baker v. Miller, 636 N.E.2d 551, 558 (Ill. 1994) (holding\n\nconstitutional    provision      directly   prohibiting   discrimination    in\n\nemployment was self-executing); Layne v. Superintendent, 546 N.E.2d\n\n166, 168–69 (Mass. 1989) (considering the merits of a direct equal\n\nprotection claim); Smith v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, 410 N.W.2d 749, 798\n\n(Mich. 1987) (considering the merits of a direct equal protection claim); In\n\nre Town Highway No. 20, 45 A.3d 54, 67 (Vt. 2012) (holding article of\n\nstate constitution prohibiting discriminatory treatment to be self-\n\nexecuting).\n\n      We, of course, have not hesitated to enforce the equal protection\n\nclauses of the Iowa and Federal Constitutions. For example, in Varnum\n\f                                    53\n\nwe held that a law prohibiting same-sex marriage violated equal\n\nprotection because there was no justification for the classification which\n\nsubstantially furthered any governmental objective. 763 N.W.2d at 906–\n\n07. In Dudley, we held a statute which provided for less advantageous\n\ntreatment for indigent, acquitted criminal defendants than for ordinary\n\ncivil judgment debtors violated the Equal Protection Clause because\n\nthere was no rational basis for the classification. 766 N.W.2d at 617. In\n\nIn re S.A.J.B., we held a statute providing that indigent parents defending\n\ninvoluntary parental rights termination proceedings under Iowa Code\n\nchapter 232 could receive state-appointed counsel but indigent parents\n\ndefending involuntary parental rights termination proceedings under\n\nchapter 600A could not have state-appointed counsel was a violation of\n\nequal protection. 679 N.W.2d 645, 651 (Iowa 2004). In Glowacki v. State\n\nBoard of Medical Examiners, we held that a statute prohibiting the grant\n\nof a stay in a suspension of a doctor’s license to practice medicine, but\n\npermitting stays in other professional licensure investigations, violated a\n\ndoctor’s right to equal protection. 501 N.W.2d 539, 542 (Iowa 1993).\n\n      Our cases clearly show that our equal protection clause has always\n\nbeen considered to be self-executing.    We therefore reaffirm the equal\n\nprotection clause of the Iowa Constitution is self-executing.\n\n      IV. Preemption of Iowa Constitutional Claims by the Iowa\nCivil Rights Act.\n\n      A. Introduction.     The defendants suggest that any potential\n\nconstitutional claim that Godfrey may have is preempted by the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act. At the outset, however, it is important to distinguish\n\nbetween preemption and the question of adequacy of the statutory\n\nremedy.\n\f                                            54\n\n      Preemption is a question of legislative intent.                    Ackerman v. Am.\n\nCyanamid Co., 586 N.W.2d 208, 211 (Iowa 1998). When the legislature\n\nexpressly preempts common law or other fields of law, there is no\n\nproblem of statutory interpretation. State v. Martinez, ___ N.W.2d ___,\n\n___ (Iowa 2017). The fighting issue in the preemption area is when the\n\nlegislature is silent but has enacted a sufficiently comprehensive statute\n\nto suggest an implied legislative intent to occupy the field or has enacted\n\na statute so in conflict with other legal claims that preemption must be\n\nimplied. See id. at ___.\n\n      The question of whether a statutory remedy might be adequate so\n\nas to avoid the need for a direct constitutional claim has nothing to do\n\nwith legislative intent.          It has everything to do with a judicial\n\ndetermination    of    whether      the     court     should       not    allow    a     direct\n\nconstitutional claim for damages to proceed because the court believes\n\nan   established      statutory     remedy       is    sufficient    to    vindicate       the\n\nconstitutional interests of the people expressed in the civil liberties\n\nprovisions of state constitutions.\n\n      B. Positions       of   the    Parties.          Godfrey      argues        that    Iowa\n\nconstitutional rights are not preempted by Iowa Code chapter 216.\n\nGodfrey points to differences between constitutional claims and common\n\nlaw claims, which may be preempted under the Iowa Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe sources of the rights are different and the available remedies are\n\ndifferent. Statutory rights may be abolished by the legislature, whereas\n\nconstitutional     rights     may    only     be      abolished      by     constitutional\n\namendment.\n\n      Godfrey      directs    our   attention         to   three    cases     from       other\n\njurisdictions as persuasive authority standing for the premise that\n\nconstitutional rights are fundamentally different from, and thus may not\n\f                                           55\n\nbe preempted by, statutory rights. See Laird v. Ramirez, 884 F. Supp.\n\n1265 (N.D. Iowa 1995); Shuttleworth v. Broward County, 639 F. Supp.\n\n654 (S.D. Fla. 1986); Wintergreen Grp. LC v. Utah Dep’t of Transp., 171\n\nP.3d 418 (Utah 2007). He also cites an Iowa case as standing for the\n\npremise       that   a   plaintiff   may   pursue    all   appropriate     remedies\n\nconcurrently. See Gray v. Bowers, 332 N.W.2d 323, 324 (Iowa 1983).\n\n       Godfrey concludes by arguing that even if the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\ndid preempt constitutional claims, it would only preempt his allegation of\n\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation, not his allegation of partisan\n\ndiscrimination which is not covered by the Act.\n\n       The defendants argue that Iowa Code chapter 216 is the exclusive\n\nremedy for conduct in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act. In support\n\nof this argument, the defendants cite our cases holding that common law\n\ntorts are preempted by the Iowa Civil Rights Act. See, e.g., Greenland v.\n\nFairtron Corp, 500 N.W.2d 36, 38 (Iowa 1993); Vaughn v. Ag Processing,\n\nInc., 459 N.W.2d 627, 638 (Iowa 1990); Northrup v. Farmland Indus. Inc.,\n\n372 N.W.2d 193, 197 (Iowa 1985).                The defendants state these and\n\nrelated cases stand for the rule that if discrimination is an element of a\n\nclaim, then the claim is not separate and independent from the Act and\n\nis thus preempted.\n\n       Because the operative facts that give rise to constitutional claims\n\nare the same facts as those that Godfrey relies on for his constitutional\n\nclaims, this proves, the defendants argue, the claims are not separate\n\nand independent from the Iowa Civil Rights Act.                     Therefore, the\n\ndefendants conclude the constitutional claims are preempted. 7\n\n\n       7The defendants make no direct or indirect argument in their brief with respect\nto the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671–80, the Iowa Tort Claims Act, Iowa\nCode chapter 669, or to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The defendants’ briefing\n\f                                         56\n\n          C. Discussion. There is little doubt the legislature has the power\n\nto supersede or abrogate common law remedies. Mark A. Geistfeld, Tort\n\nLaw in the Age of Statutes, 99 Iowa L. Rev. 957, 1004 (2014); Marie K.\n\nPesando, Change or Abrogation by Statute or Constitution, 15A Am. Jur.\n\n2d Common Law § 15, at 741 (2011); Kimberly C. Simmons, Pre-emption\n\nof Wrongful Discharge Cause of Action by Civil Rights Laws, 21 A.L.R. 5th\n\n1 (1994).\n\n          We have held that the Iowa Civil Rights Act preempts some, but\n\nnot all, common law claims based on discrimination.               In Northrup, for\n\nexample, we held that an employee who claimed his job was terminated\n\nbecause he participated in an alcohol treatment plan did not have a\n\ncommon law wrongful discharge claim.              372 N.W.2d at 195–97.          We\n\nexplained that employment contracts are presumed to be at-will under\n\nIowa law and we had not previously recognized a public policy exception\n\nto the rule. Id. at 196. The Iowa Civil Rights Act, however, allowed for\n\nsuch an action after following its procedures to first seek administrative\n\nrelief.    Id.   We said, “It is clear from a reading of [the Act] that the\n\nprocedure under the civil rights act is exclusive, and a claimant asserting\n\na discriminatory practice must pursue the remedy provided by the act.”\n\nId. at 197. The employee also raised a claim of intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress related to the discriminatory practice—the employer\n\ndid not argue that the emotional distress action was also preempted by\n\nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act because we did not consider the issue. Id. at\n\n197–98.\n\n\n________________________\nfocuses solely on Iowa caselaw considering whether the Iowa Civil Rights Act preempts\ncommon law claims and argues, by analogy, that Iowa constitutional claims should also\nbe preempted.\n\f                                        57\n\n         Subsequent to Northrup, we recognized that an at-will employee\n\ncould pursue an action for wrongful discharge if the discharge violated\n\npublic policy—but, if the wrongful acts complained of violated the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act, the Act was the sole remedy for the wrongful discharge\n\nclaim.     Vaughn, 459 N.W.2d at 637–38 (Iowa 1990); see also Smidt v.\n\nPorter, 695 N.W.2d 9, 17 (Iowa 2005); Borschel, 512 N.W.2d at 567–68;\n\nHamilton v. First Baptist Elderly Hous. Found., 436 N.W.2d 336, 341\n\n(Iowa 1989).        We also held, however, that a breach of employment\n\ncontract claim based on the same facts as the claim of wrongful\n\ndischarge was not preempted by the Act. Vaughn, 459 N.W.2d at 638–\n\n39; see also Grahek v. Voluntary Hosp. Co-op. Ass’n of Iowa, Inc., 473\n\nN.W.2d 31, 33–34 (Iowa 1991) (rejecting argument that employee’s\n\nbreach of contract claim was merely an artfully pled claim of\n\ndiscrimination). But see Polk Cty. Secondary Roads v. Iowa Civil Rights\n\nComm’n, 468 N.W.2d 811, 816–17 (Iowa 1991) (holding contractual claim\n\npreempted by Iowa Civil Rights Act when breach was failure to follow\n\nunion’s arbitration agreement and dispute resolution provision of Act\n\nrendered arbitration inappropriate).\n\n         In Greenland, we explained that when a common law claim\n\nrequires “proof of discrimination,” the claim is preempted by the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act. 500 N.W.2d at 38. However, when a claim is separate\n\nand independent, it is an incidental cause of action and is not\n\npreempted.      Id.    In Greenland, we found the employee’s emotional\n\ndistress    claim     was   preempted   because      the   outrageous   conduct\n\ncomplained of was discrimination.            Id.   The employee’s assault and\n\nbattery claims, however, were not preempted because they were\n\n“complete without any reference to discrimination.”           Id. at 38–39; see\n\nalso Channon v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 629 N.W.2d 835, 858 (Iowa\n\f                                    58\n\n2001) (upholding Greenland in dismissing emotional distress claim and\n\nrejecting the argument that Greenland was inconsistent with Northrup).\n\n      D. Discussion of Preemption of Constitutional Claims.             We\n\nhave not heard a case concerning whether the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\npreempts otherwise valid constitutional claims. For that matter, we have\n\nnot heard a case concerning whether any legislative act can ever preempt\n\na constitutional claim. In our caselaw, we have indicated a distinction\n\nbetween constitutional claims and claims brought under the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act. As we noted in Sommers v. Iowa Civil Rights Commission, we\n\nwere not “examining civil liberties protected by the Constitution, but civil\n\nrights which are enforceable claims rooted in the Iowa Civil Rights Act.”\n\n337 N.W.2d 470, 472 (Iowa 1983). In several cases, we considered the\n\nmerits of constitutional claims brought in tandem with statutory claims\n\nunder the Iowa Civil Rights Act. See McQuiston v. City of Clinton, 872\n\nN.W.2d 817, 832, 836 (Iowa 2015) (rejecting claims of equal protection\n\nand due process on the merits, but remanding on the question of\n\npregnancy discrimination under the Iowa Civil Rights Act).         In these\n\ncases, however, the question of preemption does not appear to have been\n\nraised.\n\n      The long-settled principle is that a constitution trumps legislative\n\nenactments. See generally Marbury, 5 U.S. at 138 (“An act of congress\n\nrepugnant to the constitution cannot become a law.”); Baldon, 829\n\nN.W.2d at 803–10 (Appel, J., concurring) (describing the process of\n\nenacting state constitutions after independence and emphasizing the\n\nimportance of state constitutions in the federal system). See generally\n\nWalt Cubberly, New Foundations for Constitutional Adjudication in State\n\nCourt, 24 App. Advoc. 425 (2012) (exploring classic philosophical\n\nproblems    with   constitutional   review   in   the   context   of   state\n\f                                        59\n\nconstitutionalism). A basic premise of our constitutional system is that\n\npopular whim may not override the individual rights guaranteed by the\n\nConstitution.    Cf. Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 562, 85 S. Ct. 476,\n\n479–80 (1965). Under the Iowa Constitution, a constitutional right may\n\nnot be altered by ordinary legislation, but the constitution may be\n\namended according to the procedures for amendment in article 10. Iowa\n\nConst. art. X, §§ 1–3.\n\n      If we held that a statute might preempt an otherwise valid\n\nconstitutional action, this would in effect grant ordinary legislation the\n\npower to cabin constitutional rights.        The Iowa Constitution would no\n\nlonger be the supreme law of the state. See Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1.\n\nThe amendment process in article X of the Iowa Constitution would be\n\nrendered superfluous.        We thus refuse to apply classic preemption\n\ndoctrine to the question of whether a Bivens-type damage remedy is\n\navailable under the Iowa Constitution.            See Greenway Dev. Co. v.\n\nBorough of Paramus, 750 A.2d 764, 770 (N.J. 2000) (“A public entity may\n\nnot use a state statute . . . to abrogate a claimant’s constitutional\n\nrights.”); Wintergreen Grp., 171 P.3d at 420 (“A constitutional cause of\n\naction . . . is presumptively superior to and must displace any statutory\n\niteration that either conflicts with it or gives it less than full effect.”).\n\n      V. Judicial Inaction Due to Adequacy of Legislative Remedy.\n\n      A. Introduction.        We now consider a question different than\n\npreemption.     As indicated above, the central question in a preemption\n\nanalysis is determining what the legislature intended when it enacted a\n\nstatute.   On the issue of adequacy, the decision-maker is the court.\n\nSpecifically, the question here is whether the court believes the remedy\n\nprovided by the Iowa Civil Rights Act should be considered sufficiently\n\nrobust that the court should, as a matter of discretion, decline to allow\n\f                                    60\n\nplaintiff to pursue a parallel direct constitutional claim for money\n\ndamages.\n\n      B. Due Process Claims Based Upon Liberty and Property\n\nInterests. While much of Godfrey’s complaint focuses on discrimination\n\nbased on sex or sexual orientation, Godfrey also has alleged that his\n\nproperty and liberty interests in employment and in his reputation have\n\nbeen violated by the partisan motivation of the defendants. The claims\n\nare based on alleged violations of procedural and substantive due\n\nprocess.\n\n      The due process claims based on alleged partisan motivation in\n\ndepriving Godfrey of property and liberty interests contrary to due\n\nprocess are not claims within the scope of the Iowa Civil Rights Act. As a\n\nresult, there is no basis to assert that Iowa Code chapter 216 provides an\n\nadequate remedy to avoid the necessity of a free-standing damages claim.\n\nSee Passman, 442 U.S. at 247, 99 S. Ct. at 2278 (holding when\n\ncongressional staffer not in the competitive service not covered by Title\n\nVII, equal protection damages remedy available); Knutson v. Sioux Tools,\n\nInc., 990 F. Supp. 1114, 1120 (N.D. Iowa 1998); Thompto v. Coborn’s Inc.,\n\n871 F. Supp. 1097, 1111 (N.D. Iowa 1994). As a result, the district court\n\nerred in dismissing Godfrey’s direct damages claim on these counts.\n\n      An amicus brief attacks the merits of Godfrey’s due process claims\n\nas being “vague” and generally inadequate.        The state defendants,\n\nhowever, did not advance this question before the district court or on\n\nappeal. One of the disadvantages of interlocutory appeal is the piecemeal\n\nconsideration of issues.     Nonetheless, the question of the merits of\n\nGodfrey’s property claim cannot be resolved at this time. It goes without\n\nsaying, of course, that we take no view on the merits of any due process\n\nclaim raised in this case.\n\f                                    61\n\n      C. Adequacy of Legislative Remedy Under the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act. The Iowa Civil Rights Act provides a substantial remedy for\n\ndiscrimination of various kinds.         No one can doubt that it is a\n\nsubstantial remedy, allowing recovery for back wages, front wages,\n\nemotional distress, and attorneys’ fees.      There is caselaw from other\n\nstates supporting the general principle that a constitutionally adequate\n\nstatutory remedy may be sufficient to allow a court to decline to permit a\n\nparallel direct constitutional claim.      See, e.g., Dilley v. Americana\n\nHealthcare Corp., 472 N.E.2d 596, 603 (Ill. Ct. App. 1984); Provens v.\n\nStark Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation & Developmental Disabilities, 594\n\nN.E.2d 959, 965–66 (Ohio 1992).      As noted by the Supreme Court of\n\nColorado, legislation implementing constitutional rights “is permissible\n\nas long as it does not directly or indirectly impair, limit, or destroy the\n\nrights that the executing . . . provision provides.” Cacioppo v. Eagle Cty.\n\nSch. Dist. Re–50J, 92 P.3d 454, 463 (Colo. 2004) (en banc).       On this\n\nissue, three members of the court conclude that the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\ndoes not preempt the plaintiff’s Bivens-type constitutional claims, while a\n\nmajority conclude that the district court properly dismissed Godfrey’s\n\nIowa constitutional claims based upon Iowa equal protection principles\n\nbecause of the adequacy of remedies under the Iowa Civil Rights Act.\n\nWhat follows is a discussion of why three members of the court conclude\n\nthe legislative remedy is inadequate and thus why the Bivens-type equal\n\nprotection claims should be allowed to proceed.\n\n      In considering whether we should consider the adequacy of the\n\nIowa Civil Rights Act for claims of discrimination in employment in\n\nviolation of the equal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution, there\n\nare two factors that give us pause. First, an independent constitutional\n\nclaim advances separate interests.       Second, the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\f                                     62\n\ndoes not allow punitive damages. Ackelson v. Manley Toy Direct, L.L.C.,\n\n832 N.W.2d 678, 689 (Iowa 2013).\n\n        A constitutional violation is different from an ordinary dispute\n\nbetween two private parties.        As Justice Harlan noted in Bivens,\n\n“[I]njuries inflicted by officials acting under color of law, while no less\n\ncompensable in damages than those inflicted by private parties, are\n\nsubstantially different in kind . . . .” Bivens, 403 U.S. at 409, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n2011.     When a constitutional violation is involved, more than mere\n\nallocation of risks and compensation is implicated. The emphasis is not\n\nsimply on compensating an individual who may have been harmed by\n\nillegal conduct, but also upon deterring unconstitutional conduct in the\n\nfuture. As noted by one commentator, punitive damages are available to\n\n“express sharp social disapproval” as well as prevent recurrence of\n\nunconstitutional conduct. Thomas J. Madden et al., Bedtime for Bivens:\n\nSubstituting the United States as Defendant in Constitutional Tort Suits,\n\n20 Harv. J. on Legis. 469, 489–90 (1983) (emphasis added). Additionally,\n\nthe United States Supreme Court noted that punitive damages “are\n\nespecially appropriate to redress the violation by a Government official of\n\na citizen’s constitutional rights.” Carlson, 446 U.S. at 22, 100 S. Ct. at\n\n1473. Similarly, in Smith v. Wade, the Court emphasized that “society\n\nhas an interest in deterring and punishing all intentional or reckless\n\ninvasions of the rights of others.” 461 U.S. 30, 54, 103 S. Ct. 1625, 1639\n\n(1983) (first emphasis added).       Vindication of the social interest is\n\ndistinct from adequate compensation goals of tort law and most statutory\n\nremedies, including those under Iowa Code chapter 216.\n\n        Bivens, Carslon, and Smith thus teach that a constitutional claim\n\nis designed “to vindicate social policies which, by virtue of their inclusion\n\nin the Constitution, are aimed predominantly at restraining the\n\f                                        63\n\nGovernment as an instrument of popular will.” Rosalie Berger Levinson,\n\nRecognizing a Damage Remedy to Enforce Indiana’s Bill of Rights, 40 Val.\n\nU. L. Rev. 1, 11 (2005) (quoting Bivens, 403 U.S. at 404, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n2008); see also Sommers, 337 N.W.2d at 472 (distinguishing between\n\ncivil liberties protected by the Constitution and civil rights claims which\n\nare enforceable by statute).    The focus in a constitutional tort is not\n\ncompensation     as   much     as   ensuring       effective   enforcement     of\n\nconstitutional rights. Michael Wells, Punitive Damages for Constitutional\n\nTorts, 56 La. L. Rev. 841, 858–62 (1996) [hereinafter Wells, Punitive]\n\n(noting constitutional torts protect different interests and the focus on a\n\nconstitutional tort is not on compensation but on development of an\n\neffective system of constitutional remedies). The harm to society is not\n\ncaptured by a judgment that solely compensates a plaintiff for his injury.\n\nSee Michael Wells, Constitutional Remedies, Section 1983 and the\n\nCommon Law, 68 Miss. L.J. 157, 189 (1998). A gap thus exists between\n\nthe injury incurred by the plaintiff and the total harm to society caused\n\nby a constitutional violation. See id. Constitutional torts and common\n\nlaw torts thus protect different interests. Wells, Punitive, 56 La. L. Rev.\n\nat 863.\n\n      A number of cases agree with the notion that constitutional rights\n\nare distinguishable from common law or statutory claims.            See Laird,\n\n884 F. Supp. at 1284 (holding remedial scheme of social security act\n\ndesigned   to   vindicate   statutory    rights   not   constitutional   rights);\n\nWintergreen Grp., 171 P.3d at 422 (“[O]wing to its different lineage, a\n\nconstitutional cause of action can never be preempted by statute,\n\nregardless of how fully the statute honors the contours of the\n\nconstitutional claim.”).    Because the interests being vindicated are\n\ndifferent, parallel claims are appropriate.       See Johnson v. Ry. Express\n\f                                   64\n\nAgency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 461, 95 S. Ct. 1716, 1721 (1975) (noting that\n\nremedies available under Title VII “although related, and although\n\ndirected to most of the same ends, are separate, distinct, and\n\nindependent” from claims of discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981).\n\nConsistent with the distinction between constitutional torts and common\n\nlaw tort or statutory claims, federal courts have frequently held that\n\npunitive damages are available in constitutional tort cases when no\n\ncompensatory damages are awarded, while punitive damages in other\n\ncases are generally not available absent compensatory damages.         See\n\nWilliam H. Volz & Michael C. Fayz, Punitive Damages and the Due\n\nProcess Clause: The Search for Constitutional Standards, 69 U. Det.\n\nMercy L. Rev. 459, 498 nn.188 & 189 (1992) (citing cases).\n\n      The difference between a purely private claim and a constitutional\n\nclaim which necessarily involves a strong social interest in enforcement\n\nis illustrated by the importance of the availability of punitive damages.\n\nThe substantial traditional authority for the proposition that the\n\navailability of individual liability for punitive damages is an important\n\nfactor in determining whether a court should permit a direct action for\n\nmoney damages.      In Huckle, the Lord Chief Justice conceded that the\n\nactual damages were small, but defended the jury’s award of £ 300,\n\nnoting, “I think they have done right in giving exemplary damages.” 95\n\nEng. Rep. at 769.    Similarly, in Ashby v. While, the jury awarded the\n\nhefty sum of £ 200 for violation of the right to vote. (1703) 92 Eng. Rep.\n\n126, 127–28. Historically, then, punitive damages played an important\n\nrole in the enforcement of individual rights against the government.\n\n      There is caselaw from the United States Supreme Court that\n\nsupports the importance of punitive damages in the panoply of\n\nconstitutional remedies.    In Carlson, the Court noted the lack of\n\f                                            65\n\navailability of punitive damages was an important factor in finding that a\n\nremedial scheme was inadequate to protect constitutional rights.                       446\n\nU.S. at 22, 100 S. Ct. at 1473.            The Carlson approach was consistent\n\nwith Frazier v. Parsons, where the Supreme Court of Louisiana declared\n\n       “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\n       papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and\n       seizures . . . ,” would be a mockery if courts . . . failed to\n       inflict exemplary damages for the wanton abuse of the\n       personal liberty and private rights of property.\n\n24 La. Ann. 339, 341 (La. 1872) (emphasis omitted).\n\n       Other authorities agree. For instance, in Dunbar Corp. v. Lindsey,\n\nthe Fourth Circuit noted that “[t]he underlying purpose of the Bill of\n\nRights is to protect the people from the power of the government.” 905\n\nF.2d 754, 763 (4th Cir. 1990). Further, the Fourth Circuit noted that if a\n\nBivens-type action were not found, the claimant lacked any remedy\n\neffective against individual defendants and for punitive damages. 8 Id.;\n\nsee also Taylor v. Bright, No. 00–6676, 2000 WL 1144624, at *2 (4th Cir.\n\nAug. 14, 2000) (per curiam) (citing lack of punitive damages or injunctive\n\nrelief under Federal Tort Claims Act as not barring § 1983 action).\n\nSimilarly, in Newell v. City of Elgin, the Illinois court noted the lack of\nexemplary damages against a municipality in a statutory scheme as\n\nbeing a factor in allowing a Bivens claim. 340 N.E.2d 344, 350 (Ill. App.\n\nCt. 1976).      Conversely, it is sometimes said that an administrative\n\nremedy was adequate because the plaintiff could recover punitive\n\n\n\n\n       8The Iowa Civil Rights Act allows for individual liability for supervisors. It is not\nclear whether all of the defendants are supervisors. See Vivian v. Madison, 601 N.W.2d\n872, 874 (Iowa 1999). To the extent the individual defendants are not “supervisors” of\nGodfrey, they are not within the scope of the Iowa Civil Rights Act and there is no\nadequate remedy as to them.\n\f                                    66\n\ndamages. Bishop v. Holy Cross Hosp. of Silver Spring, 410 A.2d 630, 632\n\n(Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1980).\n\n      The necessity of the availability of punitive damages in light of the\n\nsocial interests in enforcement of constitutional rights as contrasted to\n\nprivate claims has support in modern caselaw. As noted in Bivens, a\n\ngovernment official acting unlawfully in the name of the state “possesses\n\na far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising\n\nno authority other than his own.” 403 U.S. at 392, 91 S. Ct. at 2002\n\n(majority opinion). We recognize, however, that there is authority to the\n\ncontrary.     See Provens, 594 N.E.2d at 965 (holding statutory remedies\n\nadequate even though not equal to the other remedies that might be\n\navailable).    But the social interest in enforcement of constitutional\n\nclaims. supported by punitive damages as in Wilkes, Huckle, and Entick,\n\ndemonstrates the distinctive nature of constitutional harms.\n\n      An amicus brief raises the concern about dampening the ardor of\n\nthe Governor and other public officers in the exercise of their duties. But\n\nthis argument, in fact, cuts in favor of a cause of action for damages.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of powerful public figures who, in their\n\ndesire to do good, have trampled on the constitutional rights of the\n\npeople. As Justice Brandeis observed, “Experience should teach us to be\n\nmost on our guard to protect liberty when the government’s purposes are\n\nbeneficent.” Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 479, 48 S. Ct. 564,\n\n572 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), overruled in part on other grounds\n\nby Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 50–51, 87 S. Ct. 1873, 1879 (1967).\n\n      In any event, to the extent that a Bivens-type action might inhibit\n\ntheir duties, the doctrine of qualified immunity is the appropriate vehicle\n\nto address those concerns.       The state courts that have considered\n\nwhether immunity applies in Bivens-type actions are divided. See, e.g.,\n\f                                   67\n\nMoresi, 567 So. 2d at 1093 (holding qualified immunity applies); Corum,\n\n413 S.E.2d at 291 (holding no qualified immunity). The issue of qualified\n\nimmunity, however, is not before the court today.\n\n      In conclusion, for the above reasons, we think the different nature\n\nof the interests protected weighs in favor of allowing a Bivens-type claim\n\nto go forward against the defendants. We do not find authority to the\n\ncontrary persuasive.\n\n      D. The Question of “Special Factors.” An amicus brief in this\n\ncase suggests that we should decline to find a direct monetary cause of\n\naction in this case because of “special factors.” As the amici correctly\n\npoint out, the United States Supreme Court has developed a special-\n\nfactors doctrine which allows the Supreme Court to decline to permit a\n\ndirect damage action for a constitutional violation to go forward.    See\n\nUnited States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669, 678–84, 107 S. Ct. 3054, 3061–\n\n64 (1987); Bush, 462 U.S. at 380, 103 S. Ct. at 2413. The question of\n\nwhether special factors are present under the United States Supreme\n\nCourt cases goes to the appropriateness of the remedy, not to the court’s\n\nremedial power.\n\n      The special-factors doctrine is a standardless exception that\n\nprovides the court with a convenient escape hatch.     In other words, a\n\nBivens claim exists except where a majority of the court finds it\n\ninconvenient.     To the extent it has any appeal, the special-factors\n\nexception has some purchase when applied to the federal government’s\n\nmilitary operations. In Chappell, the Supreme Court held that because of\n\nthe unique disciplinary structure of the military, it would not allow a\n\nBivens-type action by an enlisted seaman who brought a discrimination\n\nclaim against superiors. 462 U.S. at 304, 103 S. Ct. at 2368. Further,\n\nthere is at least arguably a textual commitment to a different\n\f                                     68\n\nconstitutional regime arising under the powers of the President as\n\ncommander-in-chief.\n\n        But we see no basis for implementing a special-factors doctrine\n\nhere. First, there is a preservation problem. The issue of special factors\n\nwas not raised in the State’s appellate brief. See Meier v. Senecaut, 641\n\nN.W.2d 532, 537 (Iowa 2002) (declining to consider issue which was not\n\nargued).     Second, on the facts presented, we are not prepared to\n\nannounce the adoption of the amorphous, ad hoc special-factors\n\ndoctrine. Instead, as noted above, concerns about dampening the ardor\n\nof executive officials should be addressed through other channels such\n\nas the availability of qualified immunity.\n\n        VI. Conclusion.\n\n        For the above reasons, the holding of the district court in this\n\nmatter is reversed as to Counts VI and VII. We emphasize our holding is\n\nbased solely on the legal contentions presented by the parties.         We\n\nexpress no view on other potential defenses which may be available to\n\nthe defendants and no view whatsoever on the underlying merits of the\n\ncase.    We hold only that the defendants are not entitled to summary\n\njudgment on Counts VI and VII based on the legal contentions raised in\n\nthis appeal.    Costs on appeal are to be taxed one-half to Godfrey and\n\none-half to the defendants.\n\n        AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\n\n        Wiggins and Hecht, JJ., join this opinion. Cady, C.J., joins in part\n\nand files a concurrence in part and dissent in part.             Mansfield,\n\nWaterman, and Zager, JJ., dissent.\n\f                                    69\n                                                  #15–0695, Godfrey v. State\n\nCADY, Chief Justice (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I concur in the opinion of the court to the extent it would recognize\n\na tort claim under the Iowa Constitution when the legislature has not\n\nprovided an adequate remedy.      I part ways with the majority opinion\n\nbecause I find the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA) provides that remedy here,\n\nat least with respect to Christopher J. Godfrey’s claim against the State\n\nfor discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\n      Godfrey alleges the State discriminated against him on the basis of\n\nhis sexual orientation by harassing him and reducing his salary. These\n\nclaims are covered by the ICRA.      See Iowa Code § 216.6(1)(a) (2013).\n\nThus, Godfrey may only assert an independent claim under the Iowa\n\nConstitution, cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau\n\nof Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 392, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 2002 (1971), if he can\n\nestablish the remedy provided by the ICRA is inadequate to vindicate his\n\nconstitutional rights, cf. id. at 407, 91 S. Ct. at 2010 (Harlan, J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment). Godfrey seeks punitive damages, but punitive\n\ndamages are not available under the ICRA. See City of Hampton v. Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Comm’n, 554 N.W.2d 532, 537 (Iowa 1996) (“Our civil rights\n\nstatute does not allow for punitive damages.”).\n\n      The importance of punitive damages was an essential part of the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court’s opinion in Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14,\n\n22, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 1473 (1980). In Carlson, a plaintiff alleged that his\n\ndue process, equal protection, and protection from cruel and unusual\n\npunishment rights were violated because prison officials failed to provide\n\nhim with proper medical attention while he was in their custody. Id. at\n\n16, 100 S. Ct. at 1470.     The Court asked whether the Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act (FTCA) provided the exclusive remedy for the plaintiff. Id. at\n\f                                    70\n\n18–19, 100 S. Ct. at 1471.      But because the FTCA explicitly barred\n\npunitive damages, the Carlson Court found the FTCA “is that much less\n\neffective than a Bivens action as a deterrent to unconstitutional acts.”\n\nId. at 22, 100 S. Ct. at 1473.           The Court emphasized, without\n\nqualification, that punitive damages are “especially appropriate to\n\nredress the violation by a Government official of a citizen’s constitutional\n\nrights.” Id.\n\n      Here, however, the remedies provided in the ICRA are robust, even\n\nwithout punitive damages. I find these remedies suffice as an adequate\n\ndeterrent of any alleged unconstitutional conduct.        First, as to the\n\nreduction in salary, Godfrey makes no claim that an action under the\n\nICRA will not adequately provide him with compensatory damages.\n\nFurther, the ICRA includes a provision for attorney fees. See Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.15(9)(a)(8).   Obviously, attorney fees cannot replace punitive\n\ndamages in cases of physical invasion, assault, or violations of other\n\nliberty interests, but their availability for a claim of monetary loss is an\n\nimportant factor in assessing the adequacy of a statutory remedy. See\n\nCarlson, 446 U.S. at 22, 100 S. Ct. at 1473. Regarding Godfrey’s claim of\n\nharassment, it is true this is not solely for monetary loss.       Instead,\n\nGodfrey additionally claims emotional distress damages. But the ICRA\n\nprovides for this, too. See Iowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(8); see also Dutcher\n\nv. Randall Foods, 546 N.W.2d 889, 894 (Iowa 1996) (“[D]amages for\n\nemotional distress are a component of ‘actual damages.’ ” (quoting\n\nChauffeurs, Teamsters & Helpers Local Union 238 v. Iowa Civil Rights\n\nComm’n, 394 N.W.2d 375, 383 (Iowa 1986))). Again, Godfrey makes no\n\nclaim that an action under the ICRA will not adequately compensate him\n\nfor damages relating to the alleged unconstitutional conduct.       Thus, I\n\nwould find the ICRA an adequate remedy for these claims and would not\n\f                                            71\n\nrecognize      an     independent      constitutional    claim      under    these\n\ncircumstances.\n\n      In the appropriate case, a remedy of punitive damages may be\n\nnecessary to vindicate a plaintiff’s constitutional rights. But when the\n\nclaimed harm is largely monetary in nature and does not involve any\n\ninfringement of physical security, privacy, bodily integrity, or the right to\n\nparticipate in government, and instead is against the State in its capacity\n\nas an employer, the ICRA exists to vindicate the constitutional right to be\n\nfree from discrimination.          While not providing punitive damages, it\n\nprovides full compensation and attorney fees. On these facts, I do not\n\nbelieve an independent Bivens-type action is necessary for the sole\n\npurpose of providing a punitive-damages remedy.\n\n      For these reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\nAccordingly,    the     district    court    properly   dismissed    Count    VIII\n\n(discrimination based on sexual orientation against the State) and\n\nCount IX (discrimination based on sexual orientation against the\n\nindividual defendants) to the extent the individual defendants are\n\nemployers or supervisors.          It is unnecessary to create a constitutional\n\ntort for these claims because adequate statutory remedies exist.\n\f                                     72\n                                                    #15–0695, Godfrey v. State\nMANSFIELD, Justice (dissenting).\n\n      I respectfully dissent.\n\n      I. Introduction.\n\n      Until today, we have never recognized direct claims under the Iowa\n\nConstitution even for actual damages. Historically the Iowa Constitution\n\nhas   been,   and   continues   to   be,    a   vital   check   on   government\n\nencroachment of individual rights.         Our courts enforce that check by\n\ninvalidating and enjoining actions taken in violation of the constitution.\n\nBut we have heretofore indicated that damages claims require either\n\n(1) legislative authorization or (2) a footing in the common law of torts,\n\ncontracts, or some other established common law doctrine. The appeal\n\nbefore us presents neither.\n\n      In 1965, our general assembly passed the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\n(ICRA). See 1965 Iowa Acts ch. 121 (codified as amended at Iowa Code\n\nch. 216 (2009)). From the beginning, the ICRA has applied to “the state\n\nof Iowa or any political subdivision, board, commission, department,\n\ninstitution, or school district thereof.”       Iowa Code § 105A.2(5) (1966).\n\nToday, we learn that the general assembly need not have bothered.\n\nApparently, people who believed they had a civil rights claim against\n\nIowa state or local officials always had a money-damages cause of action,\n\nwith both actual and punitive damages available. It just took from 1857\n\nuntil 2017 for someone to figure it out.\n\n      I disagree with the notion that constitutional monetary damage\n\nclaims are some kind of time capsule that the drafters of our constitution\n\nburied in 1857 and that can only be unearthed now through the legal\n\nacumen of this court.     The time capsule hasn’t been found until now\n\nbecause no one buried it in the first place.             Our framers did not\n\f                                       73\n\nanticipate   that    someone   could    simply   walk   into   court   with   a\n\nconstitutional provision in hand and file a lawsuit to recover money,\n\nincluding punitive damages. Thus, they provided in article XII, section 1,\n\n“This constitution shall be the supreme law of the state, and any law\n\ninconsistent therewith, shall be void. The general assembly shall pass all\n\nlaws necessary to carry this constitution into effect.” Iowa Const. art.\n\nXII, § 1 (emphasis added).\n\n      This constitutional text forecloses the plaintiff’s argument and\n\nshould be the starting-point for analysis, so I will discuss it first (see\n\nPart II below).     I will then discuss the authority put forward by the\n\nmajority for the view that a private right of action exists under the Iowa\n\nConstitution (see Part III).   Upon examination, the cases cited by the\n\nmajority demonstrate only that we allow common law torts.\n\n      Thereafter, I will turn to a second line of analysis (see Part IV).\n\nEven if constitutional monetary damage claims were available in Iowa\n\nwithout legislative authorization or a common law basis, they would not\n\nbe available to remedy discrimination based on sexual orientation. That\n\nis because the legislature has already adopted a comprehensive remedial\n\nscheme to which the plaintiff has access. On this point, a majority of the\n\ncourt shares my view.\n\n      The plaintiff has invoked that comprehensive scheme in the first\n\ntwo counts of his petition, which were filed under the ICRA and are not\n\npart of this appeal. Nothing we do today affects those counts. Still, we\n\nare upholding the dismissal of all equal protection claims against the\n\nState and against the individual defendants acting within the scope of\n\ntheir employment.\n\f                                           74\n\n       Next, I will examine the lead opinion’s conclusion that there is a\n\nright to recover punitive damages against the State of Iowa (see Part V). 9\n\nLeading up to today’s decision, the State was the only defendant in this\n\ncase, and I expect that to continue after today’s decision. Meanwhile, the\n\npremise of the lead opinion is that there is a constitutional right to sue\n\nthe State of Iowa under the Iowa Constitution for punitive damages in\n\nappropriate cases.        This would be a drastic turnabout in Iowa’s legal\n\nhistory. We have never recognized a right to recover punitive damages\n\nfrom the State in any circumstance. To do so without the State’s consent\n\nwould violate sovereign immunity. The State has never waived sovereign\n\nimmunity as to punitive damages, presumably because it believes that\n\ntaxpayer dollars should not be used to pay punitive damage awards as\n\nopposed to funding State programs.\n\n       Finally, in the last part of this dissent, I will discuss what I believe\n\nto be the limits of today’s ruling for this litigation, contrasting those\n\nlimits with the rather broad and uncertain implications of the case for\n\nIowa as a whole (see Part VI).\n\n      II. The Majority Incorrectly Downplays the Text of Article XII,\nSection 1, Which Controls the Outcome Here.\n\n       Any logical analysis of the issues in this case should begin with the\n\nrelevant constitutional language in article XII, section 1. Unfortunately,\n\nit takes the court until page 45 to discuss this provision.\n\n       Article XII, section 1 stands for two propositions.                First, in the\n\nevent of a conflict between a law and the constitution, the constitution\n\n\n\n\n        9As I read it, the opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part takes no final\n\nposition on this issue.\n\f                                     75\n\nwins. Second, the constitution is implemented through laws passed by\n\nthe general assembly.\n\n      To put it another way, the constitution has both negative and\n\npositive force.   On the negative side, the constitution is a brake that\n\ninvalidates contrary laws.      On the positive side, the constitution\n\nempowers the general assembly to enact any laws needed to achieve its\n\npurposes.\n\n      In 1859, when the adoption of the Iowa Constitution was still fresh\n\nin the minds of everyone, our court read the second sentence of\n\narticle XII, section 1 in precisely this manner:\n\n             The constitution provides that offenses of a certain\n      grade, shall be tried originally before justices of the peace,\n      and that the latter have exclusive original jurisdiction in\n      such cases.      Constitution, Article 1, section 11.         The\n      Constitution requires the legislature to pass all laws\n      necessary to carry the same into effect. Cons., Article 12,\n      section 1. For the purpose of carrying out this requirement\n      of the constitution, the legislature, at its last session, passed\n      an act reducing the punishment in cases of persons\n      convicted of petit larceny, so as to bring it within the\n      constitutional requirement, that such class of offenses be\n      prosecuted originally before justices of the peace. By the\n      combined force of the constitution, and the laws of the last\n      session, the district court was ousted of jurisdiction in such\n      cases. Session Laws of 1858, 55.\n\nState v. Church, 8 Clarke 252, 254 (Iowa 1859).\n\n      A later case reiterates this point. In Duncan v. City of Des Moines,\n\nwe quoted both sentences of article XII, section 1 and explained, “Our\n\nConstitution makers wanted to make sure that this would be the rule\n\nadopted. It announced to the people, ‘We are turning the power of the\n\nState over to the legislature, but turning it over under the conditions\n\nnamed.’ ” 222 Iowa 218, 231, 268 N.W. 547, 553 (1936).\n\n      The majority overstates. It urges that without today’s decision, the\n\njudicial branch would lack power “to craft remedies for constitutional\n\f                                     76\n\nviolations of article 1.”   This ignores the first sentence of article XII,\n\nsection 1, which indicates that the Iowa Constitution, including the bill\n\nof rights, is supreme and inconsistent laws are void.     We enforce this\n\nnegative check on a regular basis, invalidating actions taken by state and\n\nlocal governments under color of law. And as part of this negative check\n\nwe have crafted remedies, such as the exclusionary rule and declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief, implementing the basic directive of article XII,\n\nsection 1 that unconstitutional acts are void.\n\n      What we have not done in the past 160 years is to go beyond\n\ndeclaring unconstitutional actions “void,” which we are authorized to do\n\nby the first sentence, and assume the legislature’s role under the second\n\nsentence.   Thus, we have never before permitted damages lawsuits for\n\nalleged constitutional violations to go forward in the absence of\n\nunderlying legislative authority or a recognized common law cause of\n\naction. It is simply stunning to me that the majority thinks we need to\n\nstart allowing such lawsuits today in order to avoid “dramatically\n\nundermin[ing] effective judicial enforcement of the Iowa Bill of Rights.”\n\nHas judicial enforcement been lax up until now?\n\n      Rhode Island has the same provision as article XII, section 1 in its\n\nconstitution and its supreme court has read it the same way as I do. See\n\nR.I. Const. art. VI, § 1; Bandoni v. State, 715 A.2d 580 (R.I. 1998). In\n\nBandoni, the plaintiffs sought to bring a damages action for alleged\n\nviolations of a victims’ rights provision contained in the Rhode Island\n\nConstitution. Id. at 583.\n\n      The extensive discussion that we have given to this issue\n      alone indicates the enormous danger of judicially creating a\n      cause of action when both the constitutional framers and the\n      members of the General Assembly had the same opportunity\n      to create a remedy and yet declined to do so. Instead we are\n      of the opinion that the creation of a remedy in the\n\f                                     77\n      circumstances presented by this case should be left to the\n      body charged by our Constitution with this responsibility.\n      See R.I. Const. art. 6, sec. 1 (“The general assembly shall\n      pass all laws necessary to carry this Constitution into\n      effect[.]”).    In this forum the myriad complex issues\n      presented by the imposition of liability can be fully debated\n      in public. . . .\n                ....\n            Under our form of government, . . . the function of\n      adjusting remedies to rights is a legislative responsibility\n      rather than a judicial task, and up until the present time the\n      Legislature has not provided a remedy for those instances in\n      which officials fail to inform crime victims of their rights.\n\nId. at 595–96.\n\n      The equal protection clause in the Michigan Constitution ends with\n\nlanguage similar to the second sentence of article XII, section 1.      It\n\nprovides, “The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate\n\nlegislation.”    Mich. Const. art. I, § 2.   Relying on this language, the\n\nMichigan Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who allegedly had been a\n\nvictim of racial discrimination could not pursue a direct action under the\n\nMichigan equal protection clause. See Lewis v. State, 629 N.W.2d 868,\n\n868, 872 (Mich. 2001). The court reasoned,\n\n             On its face, the implementation power of Const. 1963,\n      art. 1, § 2 is given to the Legislature. Because of this, for\n      this Court to implement Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2 by allowing,\n      for example, money damages, would be to arrogate this\n      power given expressly to the Legislature to this Court.\n      Under no recognizable theory of disciplined jurisprudence do\n      we have such power.\n\nId. at 871. Noting the distinction blurred by the majority in this case,\n\nthe Michigan Supreme Court added,\n\n      [O]ur holding should not be construed as a demurral to the\n      traditional judicial power to invalidate legislation or other\n      positive governmental action that directly violates the equal\n      protection guarantee of Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2. There is\n      obviously a distinction between a judicial decree invalidating\n      unconstitutional governmental action and the adoption of\n      judicially created doctrines that effectively serve as de facto\n      statutory enactments to implement Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2.\n\f                                    78\n\nId. at 871–72 (footnote omitted).\n\n      During the debates on adoption of the 1857 Constitution, the\n\ndelegates appeared to recognize that constitutional damages suits\n\nagainst the State required separate authorization.       At one point the\n\ndelegates discussed adding language authorizing damage suits against\n\nthe State if the State took away privileges or immunities it had previously\n\ngranted. 1 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of\n\nIowa 104 (W. Blair Lord rep., 1857), www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services\n\n/collections/law-library/iaconst. One delegate criticized the proposal as\n\nnot going far enough, observing that “a citizen cannot sue the State.\n\nWhere is he to go, then, to get his damages?” Id. at 105.\n\n      When it was then proposed that the provision be strengthened to\n\nexpressly state that “the State shall be liable to an action at law in any\n\ncourt of record in this State,” id., another delegate responded,\n\n      I am opposed to the amendment . . . for I do not want to\n      ingraft anything upon the Constitution of the State of Iowa,\n      that will be liable to get the State into an innumerable\n      number of law suits. I do not believe in having the State\n      dragged into the courts of the State. I am opposed to this\n      thing here, and if anything of the sort is to be done, let the\n      legislature make the necessary provision for it.\n\nId. at 106.   A third delegate commented, “I do not believe it would be\n\npolitic to make a constitutional law that will be the means of getting the\n\nState into law suits, the end of which no man can foretell.” Id. A fourth\n\ndelegate spoke on “the impolicy of making the State a party to a suit at\n\nlaw, in courts of justice[;] and every mind recognizes the impolicy of that\n\npractice.” Id. at 110.\n\n      In the end, the provision was not adopted. Id. at 115. But the key\n\npoint is this: these framers understood the State generally could not be\n\f                                    79\n\nsued, even on a constitutional claim, without express authorization from\n\nthe constitution itself or from the general assembly.\n\n      Consistent with the text of article XII, section 1 and this history,\n\nwe have said on a number of occasions that the provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are not self-executing. See Van Baale v. City of Des Moines,\n\n550 N.W.2d 153, 157 (Iowa 1996) (“Although the equal protection clause\n\ncreates a constitutionally protected right, it is not self-enforcing. Equal\n\nprotection rights may be enforced only if the Congress or a legislature\n\nprovides a means of redress through appropriate legislation.” (citation\n\nomitted)); State ex rel. Halbach v. Claussen, 216 Iowa 1079, 1091, 250\n\nN.W. 195, 200 (1933) (“The Constitution . . . is in no sense self-executing.\n\nIts mandates directed to the Legislature must be obeyed in accordance\n\nwith the provisions made thereby for that purpose.”); Edmundson v.\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 98 Iowa 639, 646, 67 N.W. 671, 673 (1896) (“The\n\nconstitutional provision is not self-executing or self-enforcing.      It is\n\npurely a matter of defense to recovery upon a contract . . . .”); see also\n\nLough v. City of Estherville, 122 Iowa 479, 485, 98 N.W. 308, 310 (1904)\n\n(“While a violation of the Constitution in the respect in question is to be\n\ncondemned, and the courts should interfere to prevent such violation\n\nwhenever called upon so to do, yet we are not prepared to adopt the\n\nsuggestion that an action for damages may be resorted to, as affording a\n\nproper means of redress, where a violation has been accomplished.”).\n\n      The majority confuses the matter by conflating the first and second\n\nsentences of article XII, section 1. When we said in the foregoing cases\n\nthat the Iowa Constitution was not self-executing, we did not mean that\n\nit could not be raised as a defense (or a negative check, the phrase I\n\nused earlier). In fact, Edmundson and Halbach make the point that the\n\nIowa Constitution may be raised as a “defense,” Edmundson, 98 Iowa at\n\f                                            80\n\n647, 67 N.W. at 673, and “must be obeyed,” Halbach, 216 Iowa at 1091,\n\n250 N.W. at 200.          All we said is that you can’t bring an affirmative\n\nlawsuit for damages for violating the Iowa Constitution absent statutory\n\nauthority or a common law tort. The majority cites no Iowa case that has\n\never recognized such a claim.\n\n       The majority tries to sidestep the actual text of article XII, section 1\n\nby citing to other provisions in the Iowa Constitution expressly giving the\n\ngeneral assembly authority to legislate in particular areas. I don’t follow\n\nthe majority’s argument.          The majority can’t mean these are the only\n\nareas where the general assembly can pass laws. So what is their point?\n\n       Typically, these other provisions serve one of two purposes. Some\n\nspecify subject areas where the legislature must pass laws, such as the\n\nelection of an attorney general and the organization of corporations. See,\n\ne.g., Iowa Const. art. V, § 12; id. art. VIII, § 1. Others delineate areas\n\nwhere the legislature has greater discretion than usual. See, e.g., id. art.\n\nI, § 9; id. art. II, § 7.       Yet, in addition, and at the same time, the\n\nlegislature is exclusively vested with plenary authority to pass whatever\n\nother laws it deems “necessary” to implement the Iowa Constitution. See\n\nid. art. XII, § 1.10\n\n       The majority also places considerable reliance on the heading\n\n“Schedule” in article XII.        See id. art. XII.     Based on this heading, the\n\nmajority insists that the second sentence of article XII, section 1 is just a\n\ntemporary provision relating to the “transition” to the 1857 Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n       10For   example, contrast the language of article V, section 14 (“It shall be the\nduty of the general assembly to provide for the carrying into effect of this article, and to\nprovide for a general system of practice in all the courts of this state.”), with that in\narticle XII, section 1.\n\f                                       81\n\n       This contention likewise seems to me flawed. The first sentence of\n\narticle XII,   section 1,   Iowa’s   supremacy   clause,   is   clearly   not   a\n\ntransitional provision.     See Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 875–76\n\n(Iowa 2009) (discussing and relying upon the first sentence of article XII,\n\nsection 1).     So why would the very next sentence of section 1 be\n\ntransitional?    Significantly, a number of provisions of article XII have\n\nbeen omitted from the codified version of our constitution with the note\n\nthat they were “transitional.” See Iowa Const. art. XII (codified), reprinted\n\nin Iowa Code (2009) volume I at p. lvi. Section 1, however, is not among\n\nthem. See id.\n\n       A glance back at our 1846 Constitution further undermines the\n\nmajority’s position. Like the 1857 Constitution, the 1846 Constitution\n\nhad an article XIII entitled “Schedule.”     Iowa Const. art. XIII (1846).\n\nHowever, that article did not contain any counterpart to section 1. See\n\nid.   In fact, no counterpart to article XII, section 1 can be found\n\nanywhere in the 1846 Constitution. The 1846 article XIII was limited to\n\neight sections, all of which truly were transitional.      See id.    A logical\n\nconclusion is that our framers thought it was important for our 1857\n\nconstitution to include the nontransitory principles set forth in section 1\n\n(after all, the United States Constitution has a supremacy clause), and\n\ndecided that article XII was a convenient place to do so.\n\n       The majority also highlights the use of the word “this” in both\n\nsentences of article XII, section 1. I do not follow the point here, either.\n\nSection 1 uses this syntax because it is referring to the constitution that\n\nit is a part of, not some other constitution. “This” would be the normal\n\nsyntax and is used in the Supremacy Clause of the United States\n\nConstitution. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2 (“This Constitution . . . shall\n\nbe the supreme Law of the Land . . . .”).\n\f                                     82\n\n      In the end, the majority offers no explanation for what the second\n\nsentence of section 1 does mean, if it doesn’t have the meaning the\n\ndistrict court gave it.\n\n     III. The Majority Confuses Common Law Tort Damage Claims\nWith Damage Claims Based Only on the Iowa Constitution. The\nFormer Have Always Been Allowed; the Latter Have Not.\n\n      The majority asserts that we have previously allowed damage\n\nlawsuits for violations of the Iowa Constitution to proceed without\n\nlegislative authorization.   The majority is mistaken.     What we have\n\npermitted are traditional common law tort claims, such as trespass,\n\nconversion, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.\n\n      In McClurg v. Brenton, the mayor of Des Moines and “quite a\n\nretinue of followers” barged in on plaintiff’s home in the middle of the\n\nnight without a warrant, based on suspicion that the plaintiff had stolen\n\na neighbor’s chickens. 123 Iowa 368, 369, 98 N.W. 881, 881–82 (1904).\n\n“The matter being tried was the alleged trespass upon plaintiff’s\n\nhome . . . .”   Id. at 374, 98 N.W. at 883.    We held the plaintiff had\n\nsubmitted enough evidence to get to the jury and reversed the defense\n\nverdict for evidentiary errors, noting,\n\n      Even with a warrant, the law of this state forbids a search in\n      the nighttime, save upon a showing therefor, and upon\n      special authority expressed in the writ. Code, § 5555. A\n      right thus carefully guarded by the statute as well as by the\n      common law is not to be lightly disregarded.\n\nId. at 372, 98 N.W at 882. It takes considerable imagination, I believe, to\n\nread McClurg as authorizing damage claims directly under the Iowa\n\nConstitution.\n\n      Krehbiel v. Henkle involved a teacher who had to furnish a\n\nclassroom at her own expense with the assistance of some parents. 142\n\nIowa 677, 678–79, 121 N.W. 378, 379 (1909). (Times do not change.) A\n\f                                    83\n\ndisgruntled parent whose cheap pictures were not returned at the end of\n\nthe year caused a warrant to be issued, and the teacher’s residence was\n\nentered and searched. Id. “Thereafter [the owner of the home] instituted\n\nthis action for damages, alleging that in suing out said warrant and\n\ncausing the search of his premises for alleged stolen property the [parent]\n\nacted willfully, maliciously, and without probable cause.” Id. at 678, 121\n\nN.W. at 379.     We held on appeal that the case should have been\n\nsubmitted to the jury because “the evidence tends very clearly to show\n\nboth malice and want of probable cause.” Id. at 680, 121 N.W. at 380.\n\n      Although     we   did   mention   article I,   section 8   of   the   Iowa\n\nConstitution, the cause of action was a recognized common law claim for\n\ntrespass and malicious prosecution.      Id. at 679–80, 121 N.W. at 379.\n\nNotably, the defendant was not a public official subject to article I,\n\nsection 8, but a private party—i.e., the disgruntled parent. Id. at 678–79,\n\n121 N.W. at 379.\n\n      The third case relied on by the majority, Girard v. Anderson, also\n\nwas between private parties.     219 Iowa 142, 143, 257 N.W. 400, 400\n\n(1934). The plaintiff bought a piano from the defendant but fell behind\n\non the payments. Id. Two of the defendant’s employees allegedly broke\n\nand entered into the plaintiff’s home to repossess the piano. Id. at 144,\n\n257 N.W. at 400. The plaintiff sued. Id. at 144–45, 257 N.W. at 401. We\n\nheld the plaintiff had triable claims as to both trespass and conversion.\n\nId. at 145, 257 N.W. at 401. The main issue in the case was whether the\n\ndefendant could rely on language in the piano sales contract to justify his\n\nagents’ entry into the plaintiff’s home. Id. We decided otherwise:\n\n             We are not willing to adopt a rule that will permit the\n      seller under a contract of this kind to take the law into his\n      own hands by forcibly retaking possession of property sold,\n      where any resistance is offered by the purchaser.\n\f                                            84\n\nId. at 149, 257 N.W. at 403.\n\n       In the course of our opinion in Girard, we quoted article I,\n\nsection 8, recognizing that it protects “the sacredness of the home.” Id.\n\nat 148, 257 N.W. at 402. We also cited McClurg and Krehbiel and said,\n\n“A violation of the state and federal constitutional provisions against the\n\nunreasonable invasion of a person’s home gives the injured party a right\n\nof action for damages for unlawful breaking and entering.” Id. at 148,\n\n257 N.W. at 403. But as in those two cases, the actual cause of action\n\nwas an established one under the common law. Id. at 145, 257 N.W. at\n\n401. To put it another way, these causes of action did not depend on the\n\nexistence of article I, section 8, but were traditional common law claims\n\nand would have gone forward even if article I, section 8 were not part of\n\nour constitution. The majority’s three cases need to be juxtaposed with\n\nthe caselaw already discussed where we said the provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are not self-executing. 11\n\n     IV. The ICRA Remedy for the Alleged Discrimination Is\nExclusive and This Court Lacks Authority to Devise a Different\nRemedy That It Might Prefer.\n\n       Even when direct damage lawsuits have been permitted under\nother state constitutions (i.e., constitutions that do not have a\n\ncounterpart to article XII, section 1), they are typically not allowed when\n\nthe legislature already has devised a remedial system for the same\n\n\n\n       11The  court also mentions State v. Tonn, 195 Iowa 94, 191 N.W. 530 (1923),\nabrogated on other grounds by State v. Cline, 617 N.W.2d 277, 291 (Iowa 2000). This,\nhowever, was a criminal case where our court rejected the applicability of the\nexclusionary rule in state criminal prosecutions. Id. at 107, 191 N.W. at 536. We did\nstate, “A trespassing officer is liable for all wrong done in an illegal search or seizure.”\nId. at 106, 191 N.W. at 535. We did not discuss the specific basis for liability—whether\nit was trespass or the Iowa Constitution. The use of “trespassing” in our sentence\nsuggests the former. We also did not discuss whether liability meant damages liability.\n\f                                      85\n\nwrong. Employment discrimination claims in Iowa are an area where the\n\nlegislature has devised such a remedial scheme.\n\n      In Iowa, the general assembly has directed that a person “claiming\n\nto be aggrieved by an unfair or discriminatory practice must initially seek\n\nan administrative relief,” and thereafter may bring a civil action under\n\nthe ICRA. See Iowa Code § 216.16(1), (2). This remedy is “exclusive.”\n\nSmidt v. Porter, 695 N.W.2d 9, 17 (Iowa 2005) (“To the extent the ICRA\n\nprovides a remedy for a particular discriminatory practice, its procedure\n\nis exclusive and the claimant asserting that practice must pursue the\n\nremedy it affords.”); see Northrup v. Farmland Indus., Ind., 372 N.W.2d\n\n193, 197 (Iowa 1985) (stating that “the procedure under the civil rights\n\nact is exclusive, and a claimant asserting a discriminatory practice must\n\npursue the remedy provided by the act”); see also Channon v. United\n\nParcel Serv., Inc., 629 N.W.2d 835, 858 (Iowa 2001) (reiterating Northrup’s\n\nholding and citing additional cases); Kingsley v. Woodbury Cty. Civil Serv.\n\nComm’n, 459 N.W.2d 265, 266 (Iowa 1990) (noting that “the exclusive\n\nremedy for complainants asserting a discriminatory act lies with the\n\nprocedure provided in [the ICRA]”).\n\n      In the analogous federal context, courts have uniformly held that\n\nTitle VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides the exclusive\n\nremedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment. See Brown v.\n\nGen. Servs. Admin., 425 U.S. 820, 835, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 1969 (1976).\n\nBivens actions for employment discrimination are therefore barred.\n\nZeinali v. Raytheon Co., 636 F.3d 544, 549 n.3 (9th Cir. 2011) (“Title VII\n\n‘provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in\n\nfederal employment.’ ” (quoting Brazil v. U.S. Dep’t of Navy, 66 F.3d 193,\n\n197 (9th Cir. 1995))); Ethnic Emps. of Library of Cong. v. Boorstin, 751\n\nF.2d 1405, 1415 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (“[F]ederal employees may not bring\n\f                                    86\n\nsuit under the Constitution for employment discrimination that is\n\nactionable under Title VII.”).\n\n      The lead opinion glosses over the Supreme Court’s substantial\n\nreluctance to coin new causes of action based on the federal constitution\n\npost-Bivens.   With nothing more than a string cite, the lead opinion\n\ndiscounts over three decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence declining\n\nto expand Bivens remedies beyond the specific circumstances of Bivens,\n\nDavis, and Green. See Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. ___, ___, ___ S. Ct. ___,\n\n___, 2017 WL 2621317, at *12 (June 19, 2017) (“[T]he Court has made\n\nclear that expanding the Bivens remedy is now a ‘disfavored’ judicial\n\nactivity.” (quoting Ashcroft v.

Ct. 2362, 2368 (1983) (rejecting Bivens claim because\n\nof special factors counseling hesitation in context of the military).\n\n      In general, the Supreme Court has determined that “[s]o long as\n\nthe plaintiff had an avenue for some redress, bedrock principles of\n\nseparation of powers foreclosed judicial imposition of a new substantive\n\nliability.” Malesko, 534 U.S. at 69, 122 S. Ct. at 520; see also Minneci,\n\n565 U.S. at 129, 132 S. Ct. at 625 (stating even though other remedies\n\nmay be “prove less generous” by capping damages, forbidding emotional\n\ndistress damages, or imposing procedural obstacles, it could not find a\n\n“sufficient basis to determine state law inadequate”); Wilkie, 551 U.S. at\n\n553, 127 S. Ct. at 2600 (“In sum, Robbins has an administrative, and\n\nultimately a judicial, process for vindicating virtually all of his\n\ncomplaints.”).\n\n      Other state courts have followed the same reasoning in declining to\n\nlayer a state constitutional remedy on top of an existing state statutory\n\nremedy. See Kelley Prop. Dev., Inc. v. Town of Lebanon, 627 A.2d 909,\n\n922 (Conn. 1993) (“[W]e should not construe our state constitution to\n\nprovide a basis for the recognition of a private damages action for\n\ninjuries for which the legislature has provided a reasonably adequate\n\nstatutory remedy.”); see also Lowell v. Hayes, 117 P.3d 745, 753 (Alaska\n\n2005) (“[W]e will not allow a constitutional claim for damages, ‘except in\n\ncases of flagrant constitutional violations where little to no alternative\n\nremedies are available.’ ” (quoting Dick Fischer Dev.

Gerhart, 658\n\nA.2d 924, 933 (Vt. 1995) (“We have been cautious in creating a private\n\ndamage remedy even where the Legislature has provided no alternative\n\ncivil remedy.”).\n\n      It is instructive to consider cases in which, as here, employment\n\ndiscrimination was the alleged wrong.     The Ohio and Illinois Supreme\n\nCourts, as well as a well-reasoned federal district court opinion\n\ninterpreting New York law, have all concluded that when a plaintiff’s\n\nconstitutional employment discrimination claim can also be pursued\n\nunder the state’s civil rights statutes, no separate constitutional claim is\n\navailable.\n\n      Thus, in Provens v. Stark County Board, the Ohio Supreme Court\n\ndeclined to recognize an independent cause of action under the Ohio\n\nConstitution for compensatory and punitive damages for discrimination.\n\n594 N.E.2d at 965–66. The plaintiff in Provens was a teacher at a state-\n\nrun school.    Id. at 959–60.    In her complaint, Provens alleged that\n\nsupervisors at the facility “had harassed, discriminated against, and\n\ndisciplined her,” and further retaliated against her because she had\n\ninitiated a lawsuit against employees of the board. Id. at 960. Provens\n\nsought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages.\n\nId. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the state, in\n\npart because “it would be inappropriate for the court to create a new\n\njudicial remedy.” Id. at 961.\n\f                                        89\n\n      On appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed.                   Id. at 966.\n\nAlthough the court noted that Provens had not specified which of her\n\nrights had allegedly been violated, after reviewing the record the court\n\ndetermined “a significant basis for the allegations contained in plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint were harassment claims with racial connotations.” Id. at 964.\n\nRelying on the United States Supreme Court decision in Bush, the court\n\nreasoned that the relevant question was not “what remedy the court\n\nshould provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unredressed,” but\n\ninstead,   “whether    an   elaborate    remedial   system   that    has   been\n\nconstructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy\n\nconsiderations, should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial\n\nremedy for the constitutional violation at issue.”      Id. at 963 (quoting\n\nBush, 462 U.S. at 388, 103 S. Ct. at 2416–17). Accordingly, the court\n\npointed out that the Ohio civil rights act “does provide the plaintiff with\n\nsome meaningful available relief.” Id. at 963; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n\nch. 4112 (West, Westlaw current through 2017 files 6, 8, and 9 of 132d\n\nGen. Assemb.).        Specifically, under Ohio law, if the Civil Rights\n\nCommission determines that an employer has engaged in an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory practice, the commission may order injunctive relief or\n\nany other action “including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement, or\n\nupgrading of employees with, or without, back pay.”            Provens, 594\n\nN.E.2d at 964 (quoting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 4112.05(G)). The court\n\nfurther noted that the plaintiff may have rights under the state’s\n\ncollective bargaining laws. Id. at 965.\n\n      With these principles in mind, the Ohio Supreme Court concluded,\n\n            While the remedies provided the plaintiff here through\n      the administrative process of a hearing before the [Civil\n      Rights Commission] and through the arbitration process\n      under the collective bargaining agreement do vary from the\n\f                                      90\n       remedies that might be available through a civil proceeding,\n       such difference shall not be controlling where, in the totality,\n       it may be concluded that the public employee has been\n       provided sufficiently fair and comprehensive remedies. . . .\n             ....\n        . . . [I]t is not incumbent upon this court to engage in the\n       type of comparative analysis of the relative merits of various\n       remedies that is invited by appellant. Rather, the more\n       appropriate course for this court is to defer to the legislative\n       process of weighing conflicting policy considerations and\n       creating certain administrative bodies and processes for\n       providing remedies for public employees such as appellant.\n             We hold, therefore, that public employees do not have\n       a private cause of civil action against their employer to\n       redress alleged violations by their employer of policies\n       embodied in the Ohio Constitution when it is determined\n       that there are other reasonably satisfactory remedies\n       provided by statutory enactment and administrative process.\n\nId. at 965–66.\n\n       Similarly, in Baker, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected an\n\nemployment       discrimination   claim    for   compensatory   and   punitive\n\ndamages brought directly under article I, section 17 of the Illinois\n\nConstitution. 636 N.E.2d at 552, 559. The court noted at the outset\n\nthat the guarantees of that constitutional provision—freedom from\n\ndiscrimination in housing and employment—had been legislatively\n\nimplemented through the Illinois Human Rights Act.          Id. at 553.   The\n\ncourt recognized that the Act was the exclusive remedy in Illinois for\n\nemployment discrimination, and “[t]herefore, a covered employee [under\n\nthat Act] may not bring a private cause of action to recover damages for a\n\nviolation of his rights under article I, section 17.” Id. at 554. The main\n\nissue in Baker was whether or not the plaintiff was covered under the\n\nAct.   See id.      Hence, after concluding she was covered, the court\n\nreasoned she was precluded from bringing a constitutional claim, in part\n\nbecause Act provided the plaintiff with “a comprehensive and systematic\n\f                                        91\n\nmechanism for the investigation and disposition of discrimination\n\nclaims.” Id. at 559.\n\n        Likewise, in Muhammad v. New York City Transit Authority, the\n\ncourt    rejected   the   plaintiff’s   attempt   to   constitutionalize   her\n\ndiscrimination claims against her employer, a public transit authority.\n\n450 F. Supp. 2d 198, 209–12 (E.D.N.Y. 2006).           The complaint raised\n\nvarious claims under federal law, state law, and the New York\n\nConstitution, several of which were subject to a pretrial motion to\n\ndismiss. Id. at 202.\n\n        Regarding the state constitutional claim, the court noted that the\n\nNew York Court of Appeals had previously recognized a damages remedy\n\nunder the state’s equal protection clause in Brown v. State, 674 N.E.2d\n\n1129, 1141 (N.Y. 1996).         Muhammad, 450 F. Supp. 2d at 210–11.\n\nHowever, as the federal district court explained, “the Court of Appeals\n\nsubsequently characterized Brown as creating only a ‘narrow remedy.’ ”\n\nId. at 211 (quoting Martinez v. City of Schenectady, 761 N.E.2d 560, 563\n\n(N.Y. 2001)).   “In Brown itself, neither declaratory nor injunctive relief\n\nwas available to the plaintiffs . . . . For those plaintiffs it was damages or\n\nnothing.” Id. (quoting Martinez, 761 N.E.2d at 563). Hence, the district\n\ncourt contrasted Brown with the potential avenues available to the\n\nplaintiff in order to remedy employment discrimination—namely, New\n\nYork Human Rights Law. Id. at 212. The court concluded,\n\n               Defendant specifically notes that New York Human\n        Rights Law “prohibits discrimination in employment based\n        on religion, and expressly provides a private right of action\n        for an employee allegedly discriminated against on the basis\n        of his or her religion.”      Future, similar constitutional\n        violations may be deterred if plaintiff successfully exploits\n        that avenue.        Accordingly, recognition of a State\n        constitutional tort is unnecessary in this case to afford\n        plaintiff a remedy. [The claim] is, therefore, dismissed.\n\f                                      92\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n      Along    the   same    lines,   other     state   courts   have   allowed\n\nconstitutional claims in the employment context only when there appears\n\nto be no available statutory remedy.          In Corum v. University of North\n\nCarolina, the court indicated that the plaintiff had a direct damages\n\nremedy against his employer under the state constitutional provision\n\nprotecting freedom of speech.         413 S.E.2d 276, 290 (N.C. 1992).\n\nHowever, the court noted the “critical limitation[ ]” that the court “must\n\nbow to established claims and remedies where these provide an\n\nalternative to the extraordinary exercise of [the judiciary’s] inherent\n\nconstitutional power.”      Id. at 291.     Similarly, in Peper v. Princeton\n\nUniversity Board of Trustees, the court recognized the constitutional\n\ncause of action, but only after concluding that the plaintiff’s private-\n\nuniversity employer was not a statutorily-defined “employer” the\n\napplicable state discrimination laws.         389 A.2d 465, 474, 478 (N.J.\n\n1978).\n\n      Maryland, which should be viewed as an outlier, has permitted\n\ndiscrimination claims under the Maryland state constitution despite the\n\navailability of a statutory remedy. See Manikhi v. Mass Transit Admin.,\n\n758 A.2d 95, 110–11 (Md. 2000).           However, such state constitutional\n\nclaims are subject to a statutory damages cap in the Local Government\n\nTort Claims Act, which has been found applicable and enforceable to\n\nconstitutional claims. See Espina v. Jackson, 112 A.3d 442, 462–63 (Md.\n\n2015).   Hence, even if we applied the Maryland approach in Iowa, the\n\nstatutory bars to recovery of punitive damages in Iowa’s government tort\n\nlaws would be applicable and enforceable.\n\n      Here, as I have already noted, there is no dispute that Godfrey’s\n\nemployer, the State of Iowa, is an “employer” within the meaning of the\n\f                                          93\n\nICRA, see Iowa Code § 216.2(7), and thus in my view, the Act provides\n\nGodfrey with an adequate statutory remedy. The reasoning of the Ohio,\n\nIllinois, and New York courts is persuasive.\n\n       At best, article XII, section 1 might be read as requiring the general\n\nassembly to enact a damages remedy for constitutional violations. In the\n\nICRA, the legislature has done that with respect to employment\n\ndiscrimination by state and local officials.            Once the legislature has\n\nprovided a remedy, it is not the role of the judiciary to provide a different\n\nremedy unless the existing remedy is so deficient as to amount to a\n\ndenial of due process. 12\n\n       The ICRA’s language is mandatory and comprehensive. It provides\n\nthat a person claiming to be aggrieved by a discriminatory act “must”\n\nfollow the procedures therein.         Id. § 216.16(1).      We have no business\n\nstriking down the mandatory and exclusive language in the ICRA, and I\n\nam glad we are not doing so today.\n\n      V. The Lead Opinion Authorizes the State to be Sued for\nPunitive   Damages    in   Disregard  of   Sovereign   Immunity,\nLongstanding Tradition, and the Express Language of the Iowa Tort\nClaims Act.\n\n       The lead opinion cites the availability of punitive damages as its\n\njustification for authorizing a parallel article I, section 6 track to the\n\nexisting ICRA track. However, the Iowa Tort Claims Act (ITCA) does not\n\nallow punitive damages to be awarded against the State. Id. § 669.4. In\n\nother words, the State has not waived sovereign immunity as to punitive\n\n\n\n       12The lead opinion tries to pigeonhole the defendants’ argument as one of classic\npreemption. The issue is not classic preemption in the sense that one law invalidates\nanother law, but an issue of whether this court should establish a damages remedy of\nits own liking for allegedly unconstitutional conduct when the legislature has already\ndone so.\n\f                                            94\n\ndamages, and I am not aware of an Iowa court having refused to honor\n\nthis limit. 13\n\n       A full discussion of this issue requires some clarity about the\n\nparties to this case.        Originally, the attorney general certified that all\n\nindividual defendants named in this petition were acting in their official\n\ncapacities with respect to all claims.            See id. § 669.5(2)(a); Godfrey v.\n\nState, 847 N.W.2d 578, 581 (Iowa 2014). This resulted in the dismissal\n\nof the individual defendants from the lawsuit. Id. at 581–82. However,\n\nin an earlier appeal, we reversed that dismissal in part. Id. at 588. We\n\nheld the certification did not apply to claims brought against the\n\nindividual defendants “in their individual capacities,” i.e., to the extent\n\nthese defendants were not “acting within the scope of their employment.”\n\nId. at 586.      Still, we said that the individual defendants could “file a\n\nmotion for summary judgment to resolve this issue.” Id.\n\n       Subsequently, the defendants filed two separate motions for partial\n\nsummary judgment.            One was to dismiss the constitutional claims\n\n(Counts VI through IX) against all defendants based on the absence of a\n\nprivate right of action. The other was to dismiss the remaining claims\n\nagainst the individual defendants on the ground they had acted only in\n\ntheir official, not individual, capacities. The first motion was granted and\n\nis the subject of the present appeal. The plaintiff then conceded he had\n\nno factual basis for opposing dismissal of any remaining claims against\n\n\n\n       13The  lead opinion observes that the State did not discuss sovereign immunity in\nits appellate brief. If the lead opinion is trying to make a point about error preservation,\nit is simply wrong. The State was the appellee; Godfrey was the appellant. In his\nbriefing, Godfrey did not argue punitive damages as a reason for allowing\ndiscrimination claims based on article I, section 6 in Iowa. The State thus had no\nopportunity—let alone the obligation—to rebut an argument that Godfrey did not make,\nand that was developed for the first time in today’s lead opinion.\n\f                                        95\n\nthe individual defendants, so those claims were voluntarily dismissed.\n\nAs a result, the State of Iowa is presently the only defendant in this case.\n\n      While today’s decision has the effect of reinstating some of the\n\nconstitutional claims, those claims appear to involve exclusively actions\n\ntaken by the defendants in their official capacities.            Count VI under\n\narticle I, section 9 of the Iowa Constitution challenges the conduct of the\n\ndefendants    in   “demanding      Plaintiff’s   resignation”    and   “drastically\n\nreducing Plaintiff’s salary.” Count VII, likewise brought under article I,\n\nsection 9, alleges the defendants “deprived Plaintiff of a protected liberty\n\ninterest by stigmatizing Plaintiff, by publicly and falsely claiming that\n\ntheir illegal and unreasonable demands for his resignation and ultimate\n\nreduction in his pay were due to Plaintiff’s poor work performance.”\n\nCount IX alleges that the defendants deprived the plaintiff of equal\n\nprotection in violation of article I, section 6 when they slandered the\n\nplaintiff and reduced his salary. 14\n\n      Thus, when the dust settles below, I think it is clear that the State\n\nwill remain the only defendant. Regardless of the ultimate merits of the\n\nplaintiff’s constitutional claims, they concern actions taken by the\n\nindividual defendants in their official capacities.          Any request to the\nplaintiff to resign or effort to reduce his salary would have been\n\nundertaken in that defendant’s official capacity.          And the plaintiff has\n\nalready conceded, when he accepted the dismissal of his common law\n\ndefamation claims, that he “has been unable to develop evidence that the\n\nindividual   Defendants     were     acting      outside   the   scope   of   their\n\nemployment” when they made the allegedly defamatory comments.\n\n\n       14The fourth constitutional claim, Count VIII, names only the State as a\n\ndefendant.\n\f                                          96\n\n       Moreover, the plaintiff has previously conceded in this litigation\n\nthat he is not entitled to punitive damages against the State.                     See\n\nGodfrey, 847 N.W.2d at 581 (quoting plaintiff’s counsel). So if that is the\n\njustification for creating a direct cause of action against the State under\n\nthe Iowa Constitution, it is a strange one.              The plaintiff has already\n\ndisavowed this ground. 15\n\n       Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the State is immune\n\nfrom tort liability “[e]xcept where consent has been given by the\n\nlegislature.” Montandon v. Hargrave Const. Co., 256 Iowa 1297, 1299,\n\n130 N.W.2d 659, 660 (1964). At the time of our State’s founding, this\n\ndoctrine was absolute: “No tort action could be maintained against the\n\nState or its agencies.” Don R. Bennett, Handling Tort Claims and Suits\n\nAgainst the State of Iowa: Part I, 17 Drake L. Rev. 189, 189 (1968).\n\nInstead,\n\n       one who suffered damage as the result of a negligent or\n       wrongful act of a State employee had the limited choice of\n       bringing suit against the employee personally or seeking\n       redress from the Iowa General Assembly in the form of\n       private relief.\n\nId.\n       As early as 1875, this court explored the meaning of sovereign\n\nimmunity in Metz v. Soule, Kretsinger & Co., 40 Iowa 236, 239–41 (1875).\n\nThe plaintiff in Metz was an inmate at the State penitentiary who brought\n\nsuit against the contractor of the facility for negligent construction. Id.\n\nat 236.     Prior to filing suit, though, the plaintiff had petitioned the\n\n\n       15“[T]he State and its political subdivisions are not subject to punitive damages\nas the goals of punishment and deterrence are not served when punitive damages are\nimposed against the State, and the innocent taxpayer is ultimately the one who is\npunished.” 57 Am. Jur. 2d Municipal, County, School, and State Tort Liability § 611, at\n620 (2012).\n\f                                    97\n\ngeneral assembly and received a legislative appropriation consisting of\n\nmonthly payments. Id. at 236–37. Although a jury rendered a verdict for\n\nthe plaintiff against the defendant contractor, we reversed on appeal,\n\nconcluding that the general assembly’s earlier payment constituted an\n\naccord and satisfaction. Id. at 238 (“There can be but one satisfaction for\n\na wrong.”).\n\n      The defendant filed a petition for rehearing, “in which it [was]\n\nstrenuously urged that the foregoing opinion ignores the maxim that, The\n\nking can do no wrong.” Id. at 239. In a denial of rehearing, we agreed\n\nwith the State and reaffirmed our doctrine of sovereign immunity,\n\nclarifying the maxim means that any redress by the State “must be\n\nvoluntary, and cannot be coerced.”        Id. at 240.     Relying on the\n\nBlackstone Commentaries, we said,\n\n      Perhaps [the maxim] means that, although the kind is\n      subject to the passions and infirmities of other men, the\n      constitution has prescribed no mode by which he can be\n      made personally amenable for any wrong which he may\n      actually commit. The law will, therefore, presume no wrong\n      where it has provided no remedy.\n\nId. at 239–40 (quoting 1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *246).\n\nHence, we said that Metz had “pursued the decent and respectful mode of\n\nappealing to the State legislature,” and further that it was “clearly\n\nimplied” in our opinion that “Metz could not have maintained an action\n\nagainst the State.” Id. at 240. I don’t read Metz as indicating that the\n\nIowa Constitution provides plaintiffs a remedy, absent some kind of clear\n\nlegislative action. See also Wood v. Boone County, 153 Iowa 92, 100, 133\n\nN.W. 377, 380 (1911) (“It is a general rule that, where a governmental\n\f                                          98\n\nduty rests upon a state or any of its instrumentalities, there is absolute\n\nimmunity in respect to all acts or agencies.”). 16\n\n      In 1965, the general assembly did partially waive the State’s\n\nsovereign immunity in the ITCA. See 1965 Iowa Acts ch. 79, § 4 (codified\n\nas amended at Iowa Code section 669.4). Since then, we have recognized\n\nthat the State’s waiver is “limited” to the boundaries of the ITCA. Hook v.\n\nTrevino,   839   N.W.2d      434,    439     (Iowa    2013);    accord     Graham v.\n\nWorthington, 259 Iowa 845, 857, 146 N.W.2d 626, 634 (1966); see also\n\nJones v. Univ. of Iowa, 836 N.W.2d 127, 141–42 (Iowa 2013) (“The waiver\n\nof sovereign immunity, however, applies only to the actions specified in\n\nthe statute.”). For example, section 669.14 defines numerous claims as\n\nto which the State retains its immunity from tort liability. See Iowa Code\n\n§ 669.14. In Lloyd v. State, we explained,\n\n             Section [669.14] makes clear the legislature did not\n      intend the Iowa Tort Claims Act to be a waiver of sovereign\n      immunity in all instances. It was designed primarily to\n      remove sovereign immunity for suits in tort with certain\n      specified exceptions set out in the statute.\n              Under the Act the State or its agencies is subject to\n      suit in tort as an individual only in the manner and to the\n      extent to which consent has been given by the legislature.\n      The immunity of the State is from suit rather than from\n      liability and remains the rule rather than the exception.\n\n\n      16This  did not, of course, leave our courts powerless to remedy illegal and\nunconstitutional acts through injunctive relief. As we said in one case:\n               Appellant does not attempt to obtain money from the state,\n      interfere with its sovereignty, or the administration of its affairs through\n      proper agencies. On the other hand, he only wants to protect his\n      property from destruction by the agents of the state, who exceed their\n      authority and thereby seek to take it from him, not with, but without,\n      legal right and in opposition to a legislative guarantee. Clearly the power\n      of the courts to restrain state officials from violating plain provisions of\n      the statute and Constitution is in no way derogatory to the general and\n      well-recognized rule that the state cannot be sued without its consent.\nHoover v. Iowa State Highway Comm’n, 207 Iowa 58, 61, 222 N.W. 438, 440 (1928).\n\f                                     99\n\n251 N.W.2d 551, 555 (Iowa 1977).\n\n      As a result, we have consistently held that when the general\n\nassembly has not waived immunity to suit, any damage claim against the\n\nState or its officials is barred. See, e.g., Jones, 836 N.W.2d at 141–43;\n\nMinor v. State, 819 N.W.2d 383, 406 (Iowa 2012) (“[W]here the basis of\n\nthe plaintiff’s claim is the functional equivalent of a cause of action listed\n\nin section 669.14(4), the government official is immune.”); Sanford v.\n\nManternach, 601 N.W.2d 360, 371 (Iowa 1999); Magers-Fionof v. State,\n\n555 N.W.2d 672, 675 (Iowa 1996); Genetzky v. Iowa State Univ., 480\n\nN.W.2d 858, 861 (Iowa 1992); Engstrom v. State, 461 N.W.2d 309, 320\n\n(Iowa 1990); Greene v. Friend of Ct., 406 N.W.2d 433, 436 (Iowa 1987);\n\nNorth v. State, 400 N.W.2d 566, 570 (Iowa 1987); Montandon, 256 Iowa at\n\n1299, 130 N.W.2d at 660 (“Except where consent has been given by the\n\nlegislature the state is immune from suit.”); Yoerg v. Iowa Dairy Indus.\n\nComm’n, 244 Iowa 1377, 1387, 60 N.W.2d 566, 571 (1953).\n\n      All this authority is brushed away, as the lead opinion today finds\n\na previously undiscovered right to recover punitive damages against the\n\nState as long as the lawsuit is couched in constitutional terms. But our\n\nprecedent is to the contrary. We earlier concluded that except as waived\n\nby the legislature, sovereign immunity applies even when an alleged\n\ndeprivation of constitutional rights is involved. For example, in Sanford,\n\nwe affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff’s damages claim “for the\n\ndeprivation of good-conduct time” in prison, something that clearly\n\ninvolved a liberty interest. 601 N.W.2d at 370–72. Similarly, the plaintiff\n\nin Yoerg claimed that a state commission’s failure to remit an excise tax\n\nresulted in a violation under the Iowa Constitution. 244 Iowa at 1379,\n\n60 N.W.2d at 567.      Nonetheless, we determined “the suit against the\n\f                                       100\n\ncommission was substantially against the state, which was immune\n\ntherefrom.” Id. at 1387, 60 N.W.2d at 571.\n\n      Recognizing that the doctrine of sovereign immunity may bar\n\nconstitutional damage claims is not some novel concept. In Figueroa v.\n\nState, the Hawaii Supreme Court declined to create a private right of\n\naction for damages based on provisions of the Hawaii Constitution, in\n\npart because the court determined it was “not free to abolish the State’s\n\nsovereign immunity.” 604 P.2d 1198, 1205 (Haw. 1979). Notably, the\n\nFigueroa     court   reached    that   conclusion   even   though   the   state\n\nconstitution expressly provided that all of its provisions are self-\n\nexecuting. Id. at 1206. The court reasoned:\n\n      The self-executing clause only means that the rights therein\n      established or recognized do not depend upon further\n      legislative action in order to become operative. No case has\n      construed the term “self-executing” as allowing money\n      damages for constitutional violations. More importantly, in a\n      suit against the state, there cannot be a right to money\n      damages without a waiver of sovereign immunity and we\n      regard as unsound the argument that all substantive rights\n      of necessity create a waiver of sovereign immunity such that\n      money damages are available.\n\nId. (citations omitted).       Still other state supreme courts have held\n\nsimilarly.   See State Bd. of Educ. v. Drury, 437 S.E.2d 290, 294 (Ga.\n\n1993) (“Although a citizen may be entitled to seek enforcement of his\n\nconstitutional rights, the means of that enforcement does not necessarily\n\ntake the form of a recovery of damages against the state.”); Livingood v.\n\nMeece, 477 N.W.2d 183, 190 (N.D. 1991) (“[T]his court has specifically\n\napplied sovereign immunity as a bar to a direct cause of action against\n\nthe state based on the alleged violation of state constitutional provisions,\n\nassuming that such a cause of action exists.”); Rockhouse Mountain Prop.\n\nOwners Ass’n, 503 A.2d at 1389 (rejecting a claim for damages under the\n\ndue process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution in part\n\f                                            101\n\nbecause of “the incompatibility of that remedy with the limited municipal\n\nand official immunity that our cases have recognized as desirable”); see\n\nalso Garcia v. Reyes, 697 So. 2d 549, 550 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997) (“To\n\nallow Garcia to bring a cause of action based on a violation of our state’s\n\nconstitution . . . would extend the waiver of sovereign immunity beyond\n\nthe stated intent of the statute.”). 17\n\n       The lead opinion goes a step further. Not only does it allow actual\n\ndamages against the State without the State’s consent, it also refers to\n\n“[t]he necessity of the availability of punitive damages” in justifying a\n\ndirect action under the Iowa Constitution. Of course, the lead opinion\n\ncan’t make this jump using Iowa law or our precedent—we have “clearly\n\nand repeatedly” concluded that punitive damages cannot be awarded\n\nunder the ICRA, Ackelson v. Manley Toy Direct, L.L.C., 832 N.W.2d 678,\n\n688 (Iowa 2013), and the legislature has plainly declared that “the state\n\nshall not be liable . . . for punitive damages” under the ITCA. Iowa Code\n\n§ 669.4; see also Young v. City of Des Moines, 262 N.W.2d 612, 622 (Iowa\n\n1978) (noting that punitive damages are “specifically precluded” under\n\nthe ITCA), overruled on other grounds by Parks v. City of Marshalltown,\n\n440 N.W.2d 377, 379 (Iowa 1989); Speed v. Beurle, 251 N.W.2d 217, 219\n\n(Iowa 1977) (“The state’s immunity for torts of its employees was waived\n\nas to compensatory damages but not as to punitive damages . . . .”).\n\n\n\n       17The  lead opinion claims that our territorial supreme court was “well aware” of\nthe English practice of awarding damages for constitutional violations because we cited\nEntick v. Carrington, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (C.P. 1765), in an 1855 decision. See Sanders v.\nState, 2 Iowa 230, 239 (1855). A closer examination of Sanders shows that we relied on\nEntick in striking down a statute that we determined operated as a general warrant in\nviolation of article I, section 8 of the Iowa Constitution. Id. at 239–243 (reasoning that\ngeneral warrants had been “entirely unknown” “since the decision of Lord Camden, in\n[Entick] v. Carrington”). In other words, Entick was cited for an entirely different point in\n1855 than the lead opinion cites it for today.\n\f                                     102\n\n      Here the lead opinion backs itself into a corner.           Godfrey’s\n\nconstitutional damage claims are still “claims” against State officials\n\nwithin the meaning of Iowa Code chapter 669.                See Iowa Code\n\n§ 669.2(3)(b) (defining “claim” as “[a]ny claim against an employee of the\n\nstate . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any\n\nemployee”). But punitive damages are expressly barred. Id. § 669.4.\n\n      While there’s no question that Iowans have long been able to\n\nrecover punitive damages in general, see Cochran v. Miller, 13 Iowa 128,\n\n131 (1862), conspicuously absent from the majority’s opinion is any\n\ndiscussion of precedent from this court allowing punitive damages\n\nagainst the State.\n\n      We have also previously held that there is no “vested right” to\n\npunitive damages. Shepherd Components, Inc. v. Brice Petrides-Donohue\n\n&   Assocs.,   473   N.W.2d   612,    619   (Iowa   1991)   (upholding    the\n\nconstitutionality of Iowa Code section 668A.1). The legislature can limit\n\npunitive damages even in a suit between two private parties. See id. If\n\npunitive damages are not a matter of right, how can the mere\n\nunavailability of such damages render a remedy constitutionally\n\ninadequate?\n\n      If the lead opinion were correct that there is a constitutional right\n\nto recover punitive damages from the State in appropriate cases, I am at\n\na loss to understand how that would work in the real world.              Let’s\n\nassume that a plaintiff could demonstrate that the defendant’s actions\n\n“constituted willful and wanton disregard,” Iowa Code § 668A.1(1)(a), but\n\nnot that the conduct was “directed specifically at the claimant, or at the\n\nperson from which the claimant’s claim is derived.” Id. § 668A.1(1)(b). In\n\nthat case, the trial court may direct up to twenty-five percent of the\n\npunitive damages to be awarded to the claimant, “with the remainder of\n\f                                   103\n\nthe award to be ordered paid into a civil reparations trust fund\n\nadministered by the state court administrator.”          Id. § 668A.1(2)(b)\n\n(emphasis added). So would most of the award cycle back to the State\n\n(although admittedly to a special fund)?     Or does section 668A.1 even\n\napply? As we have seen, the lead opinion’s constitutional bulldozer has\n\nalready pushed aside section 216.16(1)’s exclusivity language and section\n\n669.4’s bar on punitive damages.       Would it also get to knock down\n\nsection 668A.1?\n\n      Another question arises.    How is a jury supposed to assess the\n\n“financial worth” of the State in setting the punitive damage award? See\n\nMcClure v. Walgreen Co., 613 N.W.2d 225, 233 (Iowa 2000). Will we have\n\njurors examining the State budget?\n\n      And there is no logical reason to draw the line at punitive damages.\n\nThe lead opinion amounts to a judicial declaration of defiance. The lead\n\nopinion signals that it will not be constrained by anything the legislature\n\ndoes and can devise any and all damage remedies it deems suitable and\n\nproper for alleged constitutional violations. This principle seems to lack\n\nany boundary.      Can the court provide for a ten-year statute of\n\nlimitations? Can the court eliminate any and all forms of immunity?\n\n      At this point, a majority of this court has not decided that punitive\n\ndamages may be awarded against the State on a constitutional claim. As\n\nI have tried to show, the availability of punitive damages would be a\n\nreason not to allow direct constitutional claims against the State.\n\n     VI. The Impact of Today’s Decision on this Case May be\nLimited, but It Will Have Wide-Reaching Effects Throughout State\nand Local Government.\n\n      Today’s decision may not end up altering the result in this case.\n\nThe amici urge us to dispose of the due process claims on independent\n\f                                    104\n\ngrounds. They argue that a high-level state policymaking official such as\n\na workers’ compensation commissioner has no due process right to a\n\nparticular salary, no due process right to be free from criticism for “poor\n\nwork performance,” and no due process right to be insulated from\n\n“partisan” political action.   These arguments weren’t advanced by the\n\ndefendants, so they are not addressed by the majority. Still, they remain\n\nopen issues in this case.\n      Additionally, the plaintiff’s counsel conceded at oral argument that\nif the defendants reduced the plaintiff’s salary not because of his sexual\norientation or his political affiliation, but simply because they disagreed\nwith his policies as workers’ compensation commissioner, there would be\nno constitutional claim.\n      While the impact of today’s decision in this case may be limited,\nthere should be no doubt about its far-reaching effects elsewhere.           I\nanticipate many claims from current and former inmates seeking\ndamages for wrongful incarceration. True, if you read the Iowa Code, the\nState has not waived sovereign immunity as to such claims except in the\nlimited circumstances presented by chapter 663A.            See Iowa Code\n§§ 663A.1, 669.14(4). But now an inmate can bring a direct claim for\ndamages under article I, section 10 (ineffective assistance of counsel),\narticle I, section 9 (due process of law), or article I, section 17 (cruel and\nunusual punishment).\n      Sanford would now be decided differently; yet it is just one\nexample.   To give another illustration, in light of this court’s juvenile\nsentencing decisions, I would expect individuals who have been\nresentenced because their earlier sentences violated article I, section 17\nto seek damages for the constitutional violation.\n      For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district court.\n      Waterman and Zager, JJ., join this dissent.\n\f",

We granted interlocutory appeal.\n\nFor the reasons expressed below, we reverse in part and affirm in part\n\nthe judgment of the district court.\n\n       I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n       This case involves claims brought against various state officials for\n\ndamages related to public employment. The petition as amended named\n\nthe State of Iowa and individual defendants Terry Branstad, Kimberly\n\nReynolds, Jeffrey Boeyink, Brenna Findley, Timothy Albrecht, and Teresa\n\nWahlert.    Christopher J. Godfrey stated in the petition that he was\n\nappointed Workers’ Compensation Commissioner in 2006 for a partial\n\nterm and then was subsequently appointed for a full term by Governor\n\nChet Culver in 2009. Godfrey pled that the position of commissioner was\n\nstatutorily defined as a six-year term, whereas the Iowa Constitution\n\nestablishes a four-year term for the governorship.           Since July of 2008\n\nuntil the incidents complained of by Godfrey, Godfrey alleged that his\n\nsalary was $112,068.84 a year, near the maximum in the statutorily set\n\nsalary range of $73,250-$112,070. See 2008 Iowa Acts ch. 1191, § 14(1),\n\n(5).\n\f                                           4\n\n       Godfrey alleged in the petition that defendant Branstad, prior to\n\ntaking    office,   demanded      Godfrey’s     resignation     by   a   letter   dated\n\nDecember 3, 2010.         Godfrey, however, asserted he refused to resign,\n\nclaiming that his position was quasi-judicial, intended to be nonpartisan,\n\nand insulated from politics because of the two-year difference in terms\n\nbetween the commissioner (six years) and the Governor (four years).\n\nGodfrey’s petition described several meetings with Branstad, Branstad’s\n\nstaff, and some of the other individual defendants in which Godfrey was\n\npressured to resign.       Godfrey alleges that as a result of his refusal to\n\nresign, he was punished by having his salary reduced to the statutory\n\nminimum of $73,250. Godfrey claims he suffered other retaliation in the\n\nworkplace at the hands of the defendants.\n\n       At issue in this interlocutory appeal are four counts alleging\n\nviolation of due process and equal protection provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution. 1 In Count VI, Godfrey alleges defendants deprived him of\n\nhis constitutionally protected property interest in his salary without due\n\nprocess of law because of partisan politics and/or his sexual orientation\n\nin violation of article I, section 9 of the Iowa Constitution. In Count VII,\n\nGodfrey alleges the defendants damaged his protected liberty interest in\nhis reputation without due process of law in violation of article I, section\n\n9 by falsely claiming poor work performance.                In Count VIII, Godfrey\n\nstates the State of Iowa deprived Godfrey of equal protection of the laws\n\nin violation of article I, section 6 by discriminating against Godfrey\n\nbecause of his sexual orientation. Finally, in Count IX, Godfrey alleges\n\n\n       1After filing this interlocutory appeal, Godfrey voluntarily dismissed counts XII,\nXIII, XIV, XV, XVII, XVIII, and a second count labeled “XIV.” These were defamation\ncounts brought against various individual defendants. No other counts were dismissed,\nincluding the counts raising Bivens-type claims against the individual defendants.\n\f                                     5\n\nthe individual defendants deprived him of equal protection of the laws by\n\ntreating homosexual appointed state officers or homosexual individuals\n\ndifferently than heterosexual appointed state officers or heterosexual\n\nindividuals, also in violation of article I, section 6 of the Iowa\n\nConstitution. Under all these claims, Godfrey asks for actual damages,\n\npunitive damages, attorney’s fees, court costs, and interest.\n\n      The defendants moved for summary judgment. According to the\n\ndefendants, they were entitled to summary judgment because there is no\n\nprivate cause of action for money damages for violation of article I,\n\nsections 6 and 9 of the Iowa Constitution.         In the alternative, the\n\ndefendants argued that Godfrey’s claims were preempted by the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act, Iowa Code chapter 216 (2009).\n\n      The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants\n\non the Iowa constitutional claims.    The district court explained that it\n\nconsidered the motion for summary judgment as a motion to dismiss\n\nbecause neither party asserted any particular facts upon which the\n\ndistrict court should base its decision.    The district court noted that\n\nfederal precedent in Davis v.

For the reasons expressed below, a majority of the court\n\nconcludes that Bivens claims are available under the Iowa Constitution\n\nand that the claims raised by plaintiff in Counts VI and VII were\n\nimproperly dismissed. On the question of whether the Iowa Civil Rights\n\nAct provides an adequate remedy sufficient to stay any Bivens-type\n\nclaim, a majority concludes that the remedy provided by chapter 216 is\n\nadequate under the facts and circumstances of this case, and that as a\n\nresult, Counts VIII and IX of the plaintiff’s complaint were properly\n\ndismissed.\n\n      II.

Claims for Monetary Damages Under Article I, Section 6\nand Article I, Section 9 of the Iowa Constitution.\n\n      A. Positions of the Parties.\n\n      1. Godfrey. Godfrey argues that article I, section 6 and article I,\n\nsection 9 of the Iowa Constitution are self-executing.            As a result,\n\naccording to Godfrey, no implementing legislation is necessary for\n\nGodfrey to bring a claim against the defendants for monetary damages\n\nunder the specific Iowa constitutional provisions involved in this case.\n\n      Godfrey cites United States Supreme Court precedent as providing\n\npersuasive reasoning that some constitutional provisions are self-\n\nexecuting. The United States Supreme Court declared in Davis v. Burke\n\nthat a constitutional provision may be said to be “self-executing” if it\n\n“supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right given may be\n\nenjoyed and protected, or the duty imposed may be enforced.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95368\"><a href=\"/opinion/95368/davis-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95368\"><a href=\"/opinion/95368/davis-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212 (1900). According to Godfrey, the reasoning\n\nin Davis supports his position that the due process and equal protection\nprovisions of article I, sections 6 and 9 of the Iowa Constitution fall\n\nwithin the self-executing category.\n\n      Godfrey   further   argues   that   it   would   be    illogical   for   the\n\nfundamental principles in these key Iowa constitutional provisions to\n\ndepend upon legislative action for enforcement.             In support of his\n\nargument, Godfrey cites passages in Varnum where we stated that the\n\npurpose of constitutional provisions such as the equal protection clause\n\nwas to place certain subjects beyond the reach the elected branches and\n\ninstead entrust their enforcement to the courts. 763 N.W.2d at 875–76\n\f                                     8\n\nGodfrey further cites Marbury v. Madison, in which Justice Marshall\n\nwrote, “The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists of the right of\n\nevery individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives\n\nan injury.”   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"84759\"><a href=\"/opinion/84759/marbury-v-madison/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163 (1803).       Thus, according to Godfrey, a\n\nrequirement of legislation to enforce fundamental nonmajoritarian\n\nconstitutional rights makes no sense.\n\n      Godfrey recognizes that article XII, section 1 of the Iowa\n\nConstitution provides that the legislature “shall pass all laws necessary\n\nto carry [the] constitution into effect.”   Godfrey emphasizes the word\n\n“necessary” in article XII, section 1. Godfrey argues that no legislation is\n\nnecessary to enforce the due process and equal protections clauses of the\n\nIowa Constitution. He cites appellate state court cases that have held\n\nthat Bivens-type remedies are available notwithstanding similar language\n\nin their state constitutions. See, e.g., Widgeon v. E. Shore Hosp. Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403416\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403416/widgeon-v-eastern-shore-hosp-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 930 (Md. 1984); Peper v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Bivens, the United States\n\nSupreme Court recognized a private cause of action for damages for\n\nviolation of the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nId. at 397, 91 S. Ct. at 2005.\n\n      In addition to federal cases, Godfrey looks for common law support\n\nof his claims.   He argues that the Restatement (Second) of Torts and\n\nEnglish common law principles are embraced in section 874A of the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts, which provides,\n\n      When a legislative provision [defined in comment a as\n      including constitutional provisions] protects a class of\n      persons by proscribing or requiring certain conduct but does\n      not provide a civil remedy for the violation, the court may, if\n\f                                    9\n      it determines that the remedy is appropriate in furtherance\n      of the purpose of the legislation and needed to assure the\n      effectiveness of the provision, accord to an injured member\n      of the class a right of action, using suitable existing tort\n      action or a new cause of action analogous to an existing tort\n      action.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 874A & cmt. a, at 301 (Am. Law Inst.\n\n1979) [hereinafter Restatement (Second)].     Godfrey notes many state\n\ncourts that have found state constitutional provisions self-enforcing have\n\nrelied upon this section of the Restatement (Second) as authoritative.\n\n      Echoing Justice Harlan’s concurrence in Bivens, Godfrey also\n\ncontends that English common law long recognized a cause of action for\n\ndamages for violation of rights secured by fundamental charters and\n\nconstitutions. Justice Harlan also noted that if an explicit congressional\n\nauthority were required to authorize a damage remedy under the\n\nConstitution, then an explicit authority should also be required for\n\nequitable relief. Bivens, 403 U.S. at 405, 91 S. Ct. at 2009 (Harlan, J.,\n\nconcurring).\n\n      Additionally, Godfrey points to the law of remedies in support of\n\nhis claims. Godfrey notes that we have repeatedly provided injunctive\n\nrelief for constitutional violations without any enabling legislation. See,\n\ne.g., Hensler v.

With respect to\n\ncommon law torts, Godfrey cites Bivens, where “the Court acknowledged\n\nthat the common law could not adequately regulate the government’s\n\nunique power to inflict injury upon individuals.”     James J. Park, The\n\nConstitutional Tort Action as Individual Remedy, 38 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L.\n\f                                    10\n\nRev. 393, 413 (2003); see Bivens, 403 U.S. at 394, 91 S. Ct. at 2003\n\n(majority opinion). Godfrey also argues the statutory remedies under the\n\nIowa Civil Rights Act are insufficient to vindicate his constitutional\n\ninterests.   The Iowa Civil Rights Act does not address discrimination\n\nbased on partisan politics or his alleged deprivations of property or\n\nliberty as a result of partisan politics.      Thus, Godfrey argues, the\n\nstatutory remedy is insufficient to afford him complete relief.\n\n      Further, Godfrey notes that the remedies under the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act do not provide the same measure of deterrence as a Bivens\n\naction. Godfrey cites FDIC v.

Defendants.    The defendants argue that the due process and\n\nequal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution are not self-executing.\n\nThey claim the plain language of article XII, section 1 requires that “[t]he\n\f                                         11\n\ngeneral assembly shall pass all laws necessary to carry this constitution\n\ninto effect.”   Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1.      While Godfrey focuses on the\n\nnarrow term “necessary,” the defendants draw our attention to the use of\n\n“shall” in the constitutional provision.\n\n      The defendants argue that if the drafters of the Iowa Constitution\n\nhad intended the Iowa Constitution to be self-executing, they would have\n\nsaid so. The defendants argue that if the Iowa Constitution was, in fact,\n\nself-executing,   the    language   in    article   XII,   section   1   would    be\n\nunnecessary.      Further, the defendants point to article I, section 18,\n\nwhich provides that “[p]rivate property shall not be taken for public use\n\nwithout just compensation first being made.” Iowa Const. art. I, § 18.\n\nThis provision, defendants argue, is the only provision in the Bill of\n\nRights which explicitly authorizes an award of money damages.                    The\n\ndefendants note that while a number of states have enacted an analogue\n\nof 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for state constitutional claims, Iowa has not enacted\n\nsuch a statute.\n\n      The defendants rely on a trilogy of our prior cases to support their\n\nargument that the due process and equal protection clauses of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are not self-executing. The first case is State ex rel. Halbach\n\nv. Claussen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3429979\"><a href=\"/opinion/3432453/state-ex-rel-halbach-v-claussen/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3429979\"><a href=\"/opinion/3432453/state-ex-rel-halbach-v-claussen/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1933).                In Claussen, this\n\ncourt considered whether the provisions of article IV, section 10 of the\n\nIowa Constitution dealing with holding elections to fill vacancies for office\n\nwere self-executing. Id. at 1091, 250 N.W. at 200. The Claussen court\n\nheld that they were not. Id.\n\n      The second Iowa case cited by the defendants in support of their\n\nargument that the due process and equal protection clauses of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are not self-executing is Pierce v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3437436\"><a href=\"/opinion/3439436/pierce-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3437436\"><a href=\"/opinion/3439436/pierce-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1940).        In Pierce, the plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus\n\f                                     12\n\nordering the state tax commission to convene and directing them to\n\nexercise their honest discretion in assessing all property. Id. at 27, 294\n\nN.W. at 242. We reversed a dismissal of the plaintiff’s action. Id. at 55,\n\n294 N.W. at 256. In passing, the Pierce court stated that provisions of\n\nthe Iowa Constitution, including the equal protection clause, “are not\n\nself-executing, but require legislative action to make them effective.” Id.\n\nat 29, 294 N.W. at 243.\n\n      The third Iowa case cited by the defendants is Van Baale v. City of\n\nDes Moines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1711660\"><a href=\"/opinion/1711660/van-baale-v-city-of-des-moines/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 1996). In Van Baale, we considered\n\nclaims brought by a discharged Des Moines police officer who\n\nunsuccessfully protested his dismissal through the administrative\n\nprocess and through judicial review before finally brining a separate\n\nequal protection action. Id. at 154. We held that Van Baale had failed to\n\nassert a viable equal protection claim because he did not specify any\n\ngroup of persons who were treated differently as a class. Id. at 157.\n\n      In addition to this substantive holding, however, the Van Baale\n\ncourt added additional language.       Id.     The Van Baale court stated,\n\n“Although the equal protection clause creates a constitutionally protected\n\nright, that right is not self-enforcing.     Equal protection rights may be\n\nenforced only if the Congress or a legislature provides a means of redress\n\nthrough appropriate legislation.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n      Defendants concede that a number of other state supreme courts\n\nhave recognized direct damage actions under their state constitutions\n\nwithout specific legislation. However, defendants maintain that some of\n\nthese state constitutions have different enabling clauses and other\n\nconstitutional provisions.     The defendants claim that these other\n\nconstitutional provisions provide a stronger basis for damages action\n\nthan the provisions of the Iowa Constitution.\n\f                                       13\n\n        The defendants recognize that in Bivens, the United States\n\nSupreme Court recognized a direct cause of action for a search and\n\nseizure violation of the United States Constitution. 403 U.S. at 397, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2005.       The defendants argue that in more recent cases, the\n\nCourt has retreated from its Bivens holding. See, e.g., Corr. Servs. Corp.\n\nv. Malesko, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118466\"><a href=\"/opinion/118466/correctional-services-corp-v-malesko/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118466\"><a href=\"/opinion/118466/correctional-services-corp-v-malesko/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2368 (1983).\n\n        The defendants assert that creating a direct cause of action for\n\nviolations of the due process and equal protections clauses would violate\n\nseparation of powers. Given the express language of the enabling clause\n\ngranting the power to enact laws in order to effectuate the Iowa\n\nConstitution to the legislature, the courts cannot usurp the power of the\n\nlegislature by declaring the due process and equal protection provisions\n\nof the Iowa Constitution to be self-executing. Defendants cite cases from\n\nother states reprising such separation of powers concerns.              See, e.g.,\n\nLewis v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849167\"><a href=\"/opinion/849167/lewis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871 (Mich. 2001); Bandoni v.

These cases, defendants stress, are factually and\n\nlegally distinguishable from Godfrey’s case.\n\n        B.   Approach of United States Supreme Court to Question of\n\nWhether Provisions of the United States Constitution Are Self-\n\nExecuting for Purposes of Actions for Money Damages.                    This case\n\ndeals    with   the    proper   interpretation   of   provisions   of   the   Iowa\n\nConstitution.    Although the precedents of the United States Supreme\n\nCourt under the United States Constitution are not binding upon us in\n\f                                     14\n\nour interpretation of the Iowa Constitution, we may nonetheless give\n\nthem respectful consideration in our independent analysis.

We may consider the\n\npersuasiveness of federal precedent, but we are by no means bound by it.\n\nState v. Short, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (Iowa 2014); State v.

Ct. at 2005.    Bivens claimed that Federal Bureau of Narcotics\n\nagents entered his apartment without a warrant, arrested him,\n\nthreatened to arrest his family, searched the apartment “from stem to\n\nstern,” and took him to a federal courthouse where he was interrogated,\n\nbooked, and strip searched. Id. at 389, 91 S. Ct. at 2001. Bivens sought\n\ndamages for the humiliation and mental suffering he sustained from the\n\nagents’ unlawful conduct based on alleged violation of the search and\n\nseizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 389–90, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n2001. The agents moved to dismiss, arguing that Bivens’s only remedies\n\nexisted under state law in tort for violation of the right to privacy. Id. at\n\n390, 91 S. Ct. at 2001–02.         The agents argued that the Fourth\n\nAmendment only applied to limit the ability of the agents to defend their\n\nactions as being a valid exercise of federal power—if the agents’ actions\n\noffended the Fourth Amendment, then they would be treated under state\n\nlaw as private individuals. Id. at 390–91, 91 S. Ct. at 2002.\n\n      The Bivens Court rejected the agents’ argument, maintaining that\n\nwhen federal agents violate the Fourth Amendment their power as federal\n\nagents “does not disappear like a magic gift when it is wrongfully used.”\n\f                                    15\n\nId. at 391–92, 91 S. Ct. at 2002.        The Fourth Amendment protects\n\nindividuals from wrongful conduct whether or not state law would find\n\nfault with the same conduct if committed by a private individual. Id. at\n\n392–94, 91 S. Ct. at 2002–03.\n\n      The Bivens Court further explained that the privacy rights\n\nprotected by state law and the Fourth Amendment may be “inconsistent\n\nor even hostile” with one another. Id. at 394, 91 S. Ct. at 2003. For\n\nexample, if a private individual is granted entry to one’s home, then the\n\nprivate individual is not liable for trespass—had the homeowner not\n\nwished to grant the private individual entry, the homeowner could\n\nlawfully bar entry or call the police. Id. at 394–95, 91 S. Ct. at 2003–04.\n\nIf, however, the individual seeking to enter is acting under federal\n\nauthority, it is futile to resist entry—the police would not assist the\n\nhomeowner in repelling an unwelcome federal agent. See id. at 395, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2004. State law may not act to expand or circumscribe federal\n\npower; only federal law may so act.        Id.   The Fourth Amendment,\n\ntherefore, must exist as a claim independent from any other state law\n\nclaims. Id.\n\n      The Bivens Court supported the imposition of damages for\n\nviolations of the Fourth Amendment by explaining that an action for\n\ndamages has historically been the ordinary remedy for invasions of\n\nprivacy interests. Id. The Court explained it is “well settled that where\n\nlegal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a\n\ngeneral right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any\n\navailable remedy to make good the wrong done.” Id. at 396, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n2004 (quoting Bell v. Hood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104272\"><a href=\"/opinion/104272/bell-v-hood/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104272\"><a href=\"/opinion/104272/bell-v-hood/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777\n\n(1946)). In Bivens, the Court found no special factors which would urge\n\nhesitation to create a cause of action absent legislative action, citing\n\f                                     16\n\nspecial factors like “federal fiscal policy” and imposing liability on a\n\ncongressional employee acting in excess of authority lawfully delegated\n\nby Congress. Id. at 396–97, 91 S. Ct. at 2004–05. Finally, the Court\n\nexplained, actions for damages have not been expressly forbidden by\n\nCongress in favor of another remedy which Congress views as equally\n\neffective. Id. at 397, 91 S. Ct. at 2005.\n\n      Justice Harlan concurred in the judgment, explaining that it was\n\nuncontroversial that Bivens had a right to be free from unlawful searches\n\nand seizures, but that the real question was whether the Constitution\n\nplaced the ability to create an action for damages for constitutional\n\nviolations exclusively in the hands of Congress. Id. at 399–400, 91 S. Ct.\n\nat 2006 (Harlan, J., concurring).       Justice Harlan reasoned that the\n\nSupreme Court possessed the authority to create an action for damages\n\nbecause (1) the decision to grant damages does not involve “policy\n\nconsiderations not susceptible of judicial discernment”; (2) the Court has\n\nalways had the power to grant equitable relief for invasions of\n\nconstitutional interests without explicit congressional authorization and\n\n      if a general grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts by\n      Congress is thought adequate to empower a federal court to\n      grant equitable relief . . . then it seems . . . that the same\n      statute is sufficient to empower a federal court to grant a\n      traditional remedy at law;\n\n(3) state remedies for violations of common law rights are limited when\n\napplied to federal officials acting under color of law; (4) injuries of the\n\nkind Bivens suffered cannot be remedied by an injunction—they have\n\nalready occurred; and (5) recognizing a cause of action for damages\n\nwould likely not result in a great expenditure of judicial resources\n\nhearing such claims because (a) these claims would rarely be successful\n\ndue to jury hostility, and (b) Fourth Amendment interests rank highly on\n\f                                    17\n\na “scale of social values” compared to other interests which are already\n\nprotected by the availability of an action for damages. Id. at 402–11, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2008–12.\n\n      A few years after Bivens, the Supreme Court held that a woman\n\nwho alleged she had been discriminated against on the basis of sex by a\n\ncongressman had a cause of action for damages under the Fifth\n\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause and its equal protection component.\n\nPassman, 442 U.S. at 248, 99 S. Ct. at 2279.        After determining the\n\nplaintiff had a protected right to be free of sexual discrimination under\n\nthe Fifth Amendment, the Passman Court next asked whether there were\n\nany special factors counseling hesitation such that a Bivens remedy for\n\ndamages should not be granted without Congressional authorization. Id.\n\nat 245, 99 S. Ct. at 2277.\n\n      To answer whether there were “special factors” counseling\n\nhesitation, the Passman Court reviewed considerations addressed by the\n\nBivens majority and Justice Harlan’s concurrence in Bivens. Id. at 245–\n\n48, 99 S. Ct. at 2277–79.      First, the Court found damages are an\n\nappropriate remedy for due process and equal protection violations\n\nbecause, as described in Bivens, damages are the ordinary remedy for\n\ninvasion of “personal interests in liberty.” Id. at 245, 99 S. Ct. at 2277\n\n(quoting Bivens, 403 U.S. at 395, 91 S. Ct. at 2004 (majority opinion)).\n\nAdditionally, the Court reasoned that courts will not encounter difficulty\n\nin measuring damages due to the experience that courts have in\n\nevaluating claims for back pay as a result of sex discrimination.      Id.\n\nMoreover, according to the Court, equitable relief would not make the\n\nplaintiff whole. Id. In a statement that has become epigrammatic, the\n\nCourt noted “it is damages or nothing.” Id. (quoting Bivens, 403 U.S. at\n\n410, 91 S. Ct. at 2012 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\f                                          18\n\n      Second,     the   Passman     Court      noted   that    a   suit    against   a\n\ncongressman does raise special concerns counseling hesitation.                  Id. at\n\n246, 99 S. Ct. at 2277.        These special concerns, however, should be\n\naddressed by reference to the Speech or Debate Clause, which provides\n\nprinciples for determining when a congressman is not acting as a\n\ncongressman but as an ordinary employer. Id.; see U.S. Const. art. I,\n\n§ 6, cl. 1. The Court further explained that congressmen are not above\n\nthe law. Passman, 442 U.S. at 246, 99 S. Ct. at 2277. Therefore, the\n\nCourt held, if the congressman’s actions were not shielded by the Speech\n\nor Debate Clause, then the plaintiff’s suit could go forward. Id.\n\n      Third, the Passman Court found that Congress had not explicitly\n\ndeclared that a suit for damages is not available in a federal employment\n\ndiscrimination case. Id. at 246–47, 99 S. Ct. at 2278. The Court found\n\nno evidence that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was intended to\n\nforeclose alternative remedies. Id. at 247, 99 S. Ct. at 2278.\n\n      Fourth, and finally, the Passman Court did not perceive the\n\npotential for a “deluge” of federal claims if a Bivens claim were allowed.\n\nId. at 248, 99 S. Ct. at 2278. For one thing, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 already\n\nexisted to provide recovery for plaintiffs when the injuries occurred under\n\ncolor of state law. Id. The Court reasoned that not every tort committed\n\nby a federal official would represent a constitutional violation—the\n\nnecessity of first demonstrating a violation of constitutional rights is a\n\nsignificant hurdle that few plaintiffs could successfully vault. Id.\n\n      The Passman Court concluded by noting that if Congress created\n\nan   equally    effective   alternative    remedy,     the    need   for    a   direct\n\nconstitutional action for damages “might be obviated.” Id. The Court,\n\nhowever, seemed to stress the “might” by quoting Justice Harlan’s\n\nBivens’s concurrence,\n\f                                     19\n      Judicial resources, I am well aware, are increasingly scarce\n      these days. Nonetheless, when we automatically close the\n      courthouse door solely on this basis, we implicitly express a\n      value judgment on the comparative importance of classes of\n      legally protected interests. And current limitations upon the\n      effective functioning of the courts arising from budgetary\n      inadequacies should not be permitted to stand in the way of\n      the recognition of otherwise sound constitutional principles.\n\nId. at 248, 99 S. Ct. at 2278–79 (quoting Bivens, 403 U.S. at 411, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2012).\n\n      In addition to Bivens and Passman, the Supreme Court heard a\n\nthird case in which the issue of the validity of a constitutional action for\ndamages was squarely before the Court. In Carlson, the Supreme Court\n\nrecognized a Bivens action in the case of a mother who sued on behalf of\n\nher son who, she alleged, suffered injuries and died in federal prison in\n\nviolation of his due process, equal protection, and Eighth Amendment\n\nrights. 446 U.S. at 16, 100 S. Ct. at 1470.\n\n      The Carlson Court explained that when a plaintiff shows they were\n\ninjured by a federal agent’s constitutional violations, the plaintiff has a\n\nright to recover damages except when (1) there are “special factors\n\ncounseling hesitation in the absence of [an] affirmative action by\n\nCongress,” or (2) Congress has already “provided an alternate remedy\n\nwhich it explicitly declared to be a substitute for a recovery directly under\n\nthe Constitution and viewed as equally effective.” Id. at 18–19, 100 S. Ct.\n\nat 1471.    The Court found no special factors counseling hesitation\n\nbecause federal prison officials “do not enjoy such independent status in\n\nour constitutional scheme as to suggest that judicially created remedies\n\nagainst them might be inappropriate.” Id. at 19, 100 S. Ct. at 1472.\n\n      The Carlson Court next looked at the Federal Tort Claims Act to\n\nsee if the Act was intended to be a substitute for recovery under the\n\nConstitution. Id. The Court held that it was not so intended, finding\n\f                                     20\n\nnothing in its legislative history to show either intent to preempt a Bivens\n\nremedy or to create an equally effective remedy for a constitutional\n\nviolation. Id. Additionally, the Court found that a Bivens remedy is more\n\neffective than a remedy under the Federal Tort Claims Act because a\n\nBivens remedy is recoverable against individuals and thus serves a\n\ndeterrent purpose because individual federal officers face personal\n\nfinancial liability.   Id. at 20–21, 100 S. Ct. at 1472–73.    Further, the\n\nCourt reasoned that availability of punitive damages for a Bivens action\n\nmeans the constitutional action is more effective than the statutory\n\naction, in which punitive damages are prohibited. Id. at 22, 100 S. Ct. at\n\n1473. The Court concluded that plainly the Federal Tort Claims Act “is\n\nnot a sufficient protector of the citizens’ constitutional rights, and\n\nwithout a clear congressional mandate we cannot hold that Congress\n\nrelegated respondent exclusively to the FTCA remedy.”         Id. at 23, 100\n\nS. Ct. at 1474.\n\n      The parties have provided laundry lists of United States Supreme\n\nCourt cases which they claim either support the continuing viability of\n\nBivens claims or show federal hostility to such claims. The defendants\n\ndirect our attention to the following cases which they claim show the\n\nSupreme Court no longer favors such claims. See Minneci v.

We have no such\n\nfederalism concerns to dilute our approach to judicially enforceable\n\nindividual rights provisions of the Iowa Constitution.\n\n      In any event, a review of the caselaw since Bivens does not show a\n\nretreat from Bivens reasoning as applied to situations like Godfrey’s.\n\nRather, the cases show an unwillingness to expand Bivens claims beyond\n\nthe Fourth Amendment circumstances in Bivens itself, the due\n\nprocess/equal protection/cruel and unusual punishment federal prison\n\ncontext in Carlson, and the due process/equal protection employment\n\f                                   23\n\ndiscrimination context in Passman.

Id. at 1137. If any damages remedy\n\nexisted, therefore, it must be implied. Id. The court recognized, however,\n\nthat the state constitutional provision must be self-executing in order for\n\na court to imply an action for damages. Id. Here, the court explained,\n\nthe rights to equal protection and to be free of unreasonable searches\n\nand seizures were self-executing. Id.\n\n       Surveying the caselaw from other states, the Brown court\n\ndetermined that, when state courts imply actions for damages under\n\ntheir constitutions, they do so based on either (1) the reasoning in the\n\nRestatement (Second) section 874A, (2) by analogy to Bivens, (3) common\n\nlaw predecessors of the constitutional provision at issue, or (4) a\n\ncombination of the previous three. Id. at 1138; 4 see Widgeon, 479 A.2d\n\nat 923–24 (justifying an implied action for damages under the Maryland\n\nConstitution almost entirely based on common law predecessors—\n\n\n       4As described above, the Restatement (Second) states that when a statute or\n\nconstitutional provision protects a class of person by mandating or prohibiting certain\nconduct but does not provide for a civil remedy for a violation, a court may provide an\ninjured member of the class with a right of action in tort if the court determines that the\nremedy furthers the purpose or is needed to ensure the effectiveness of the provision.\nRestatement (Second) § 874A & cmt. a, at 301; see Brown, 674 N.E.2d at 1138. The\nNew York Court of Appeals also noted that many state courts rely on the reasoning of\nBivens. Brown, 674 N.E.2d at 1138.\n       The underlying rationale for the decision, in simplest terms, in that\n       constitutional guarantees are worthy of protection on their own terms\n       without being linked to some common-law or statutory tort, and that the\n       courts have the obligation to enforce these rights by ensuring that each\n       individual receives an adequate remedy for the violation of a\n       constitutional duty.\nId. If the government fails to provide such a remedy, the courts must provide it\nthemselves. Id. The court explained that both Bivens and the Restatement (Second)\nsupport one another and cited a number of state court decisions that have recognized\nthese principles and applied them to their own constitutions. Id.\n\f                                      28\n\nspecifically a trespass action for violation of right to be free of\n\nunreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by the Magna Carta).\n\n      The Brown court also explained that the 1777 New York\n\nConstitution’s provisions on equal protection and search and seizure are\n\nboth based on older, common law antecedents—in the case of\n\nunreasonable search and seizure all the way back to the Magna Carta.\n\nId. at 1138–39.       The availability of these common law antecedents\n\nsupports the position that the framers of the constitution anticipated\n\nthat such actions would remain available under the constitution. Id. at\n\n1139. Additionally, the recorded debates of the New York Constitutional\n\nConvention of 1938 and contemporaneous cases show the delegates\n\nassumed that victims of unconstitutional actions could sue for damages.\n\nId.\n\n      The Brown court also held that implying a damages remedy is\n\nconsistent with the purposes of the constitutional provisions and is\n\n“necessary and appropriate to ensure the full realization of the rights\n\nthey state.”   Id.   These provisions clearly define duties for government\n\nofficers of the state. Id. at 1140. The abuses suffered by the claimants\n\nwere exactly the sort of abuses that these constitutional provisions were\n\ndesigned to prevent. Id. Damages, the court stressed, “are a necessary\n\ndeterrent for such misconduct. . . . [I]njunctive or declaratory relief [falls]\n\nshort.” Id. at 1141 (noting that because claimants were never charged\n\nwith a crime, excluding any evidence resulting from their interrogations\n\nserves no deterrent purpose). Further, damages have been historically\n\nrecognized as the appropriate remedy for invasions of personal liberties.\n\nId.\n\n      Thus, the Brown court held that the plaintiffs had an implied right\n\nof damages under the search and seizures and equal protection clauses\n\f                                    29\n\nof the New York Constitution.    Id.   A dissent argued the court lacked\n\njurisdiction based on article VI, section 9 (stating the court has\n\njurisdiction to hear such claims as the legislature may provide) of the\n\nNew York Constitution and that sovereign immunity protected the state.\n\nId. at 1145–48, 1152–54 (Bellacosa, J., dissenting). The dissent further\n\ncriticized equating constitutional damages actions with common law\n\ntorts. Id. at 1148–52; see Gail Donoghue & Jonathan I. Edelstein, Life\n\nAfter Brown: The Future of State Constitutional Tort Actions in New York,\n\n42 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 447, 462–71 (1998) [hereinafter Donoghue]\n\n(describing the Brown opinion and the dissent).\n\n      In Corum, the Supreme Court of North Carolina held there was a\n\ndirect cause of action under the North Carolina Constitution for damages\n\nfor a violation of a plaintiff’s free speech rights.   413 S.E.2d at 292.\n\nCorum was a tenured professor at Appalachian State University who also\n\nheld the position of Dean of Learning Resources.       Id. at 280.   After a\n\ndispute with other university officials regarding the location of a library\n\ncollection, Corum was removed from his position as Dean, allegedly in\n\nretaliation for Corum’s vocal opposition to the move.       Id. at 281–82.\n\nCorum sought damages for violating North Carolina’s constitutional\n\nprovisions protecting the right to free speech, equal protection, and\n\n“fundamental principles” of liberty.     Id. at 280; see also Grant E.\n\nBuckner, North Carolina’s Declaration of Rights: Fertile Ground in a\n\nFederal Climate, 36 N.C. Cent. L.

The court emphasized that “[w]e give our Constitution a\n\nliberal interpretation in favor of its citizens with respect to those\n\nprovisions which were designated to safeguard the liberty and security of\n\nthe citizens in regard to both person and property.” Id.\n\n      A third illustrative case is Dorwart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"886024\"><a href=\"/opinion/886024/dorwart-v-caraway/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.   In Dorwart, a\n\njudgment debtor sued a county sheriff and sheriff’s deputies following\n\nseizure of property alleging due process and search and seizure\n\nviolations under Federal and State Constitutions. Id. at 129–30. Law\n\nenforcement had writs of execution related to judgment indebtedness,\n\nbut claimed nonexistent authority to search Dorwart’s home. Id. at 130.\n\nThe Dorwart court held that the plaintiff had causes of action under the\n\nMontana Constitution for violation of the due process and search and\n\nseizure provisions. Id. at 137.\n\n      The Dorwart court began its analysis by reviewing Bivens,\n\nPassman, and Carlson. Id. at 133–36. The court noted in Bivens, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court had said “[h]istorically, damages have been\n\nregarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in\n\nliberty. . . . [F]ederal courts may use any available remedy to make good\n\nthe wrong done.” Id. at 135 (alterations in original) (quoting Bivens, 403\n\nU.S. at 395–96, 91 S. Ct. at 2004 (majority opinion)). The Dorwart court\n\nnoted that damage actions were endorsed by Restatement (Second)\n\nsection 874A.      Id.   The court cited various cases standing for the\n\nproposition that damage actions for violations of individual rights were\n\nrecognized under English common law.

Overview of state supreme court cases rejecting view that state\n\nconstitutional provisions are self-executing.     Several cases illustrate the\n\nreasoning behind state supreme court cases which reject the notion that\n\nstate constitutional provisions are self-executing for purposes of actions\n\nfor money damages.\n\n      The Supreme Court of Oregon rejected a constitutionally based\n\nclaim for money damages in Hunter v. City of Eugene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1442585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1442585/hunter-v-city-of-eugene/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 884\n\n(Or. 1990). In Hunter, striking teachers argued their state constitutional\n\nrights were violated by city employees.        Id. at 882.   The Oregon court\n\nrejected an action for money damages under the free speech provisions of\n\nthe Oregon Constitution.         Id. at 884.   The court stated it was “very\n\nreluctant to impose any civil responsibility in the form of damages for\n\nviolation of such a right, absent specific legislation or clear legislative\n\nintent.”   Id. at 883.   The court declared that “Oregon’s Bill of Rights\n\nprovides no textual or historical basis for implying a right to damages for\n\nconstitutional violations.”      Id.   Lacking legislative guidance, the court\n\nobserved “this court is in a poor position to say what should or should\n\nnot be compensation for violation of a state constitutional right and what\n\nlimitations on liability should be imposed.” Id. at 884. The court noted\n\nthat federal legislation such as 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Federal Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964 provided at least some guidance for such claims on\n\nthe federal level. Id. at 883.\n\f                                    32\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court rejected an action for monetary damages\n\nunder the free speech and assembly clause of the Texas Constitution in\n\nCity of Beaumont v.

The\n\nBeaumont court emphasized cases which were decided based on the\n\npresence or absence of alternative remedial schemes. Id. at 147–48. The\n\ncourt noted that no one had presented evidence suggesting that at the\n\ntime the Texas Constitution was written, it was intended to provide an\n\nimplied right of damages for the violation of constitutional rights. Id. at\n\n148.    The court further emphasized the language of the Texas\n\nConstitution, which suggested that acts in violation of constitutional\n\nprovisions are void. Id. at 149.\n\n       The Colorado Supreme Court rejected a cause of action for money\n\ndamages under the due process clause of the Colorado Constitution in a\n\nreal estate zoning matter in Board of County Commissioners v.

In McClurg, we reversed a directed\n\nverdict in favor of the defendants on a claim for damages against an\n\nofficer who conducted a search without a warrant. 123 Iowa at 371, 98\n\nN.W. at 882. We emphasized,\n\n       The right of the citizen to occupy and enjoy his home,\n       however mean or humble, free from arbitrary invasion and\n       search, has for centuries been protected with the most\n       solicitous care by every court in the English-speaking world,\n       from Magna [Carta] down to the present, and is embodied in\n       every bill of rights defining the limits of governmental power\n       in our own republic.\n\nId.   The right to be free from arbitrary search and seizure, was also\n\nembraced in statute and in the common law. Id. at 372, 98 N.W. at 882.\n\n       We returned to the question of damages in the search and seizure\n\ncontext in Krehbiel v.

In\n\nKrehbiel, the court noted that the right of citizens to be secure in person\nand property against wrongful seizures and searches is “zealously\n\nsafeguarded and has express recognition in our State Constitution.” Id.\n\nat 679–80, 121 N.W. at 379–80; see Iowa Const. art.

The court\n\ndeclared it was “thoroughly well settled” that “a violation of this right\n\nwithout reasonable ground therefor gives the injured party a right of\n\naction.” Krehbiel, 142 Iowa at 680, 121 N.W. at 380. In an appeal of the\n\ncase, the court affirmed an award of punitive damages in an unspecified\n\namount, noting that such damages were available for conduct that was\n\n“wanton and reckless, and in disregard of the plaintiff’s rights.” Krehbiel\n\nv.

In Tonn, we rejected the exclusionary rule for\n\nsearch and seizure violations. Id. at 107, 191 N.W. at 536. The court in\n\nTonn, however, emphasized the rejection “would not detract one iota from\n\nthe full protection vouchsafed to the citizen by the constitutional\n\nprovisions,” observing, “[a] trespassing officer is liable for all wrong done\n\nin an illegal search or seizure.” Id. at 106, 191 N.W. at 535. We further\n\nsaid the right against unreasonable searches and seizures was “a sacred\n\nright, and one which the courts will rigidly enforce.” Id.\n\n      McClurg and Krehbiel were cited with approval in Girard, 219 Iowa\n\nat 148, 257 N.W. at 403. In Girard, consistent with the thoroughly well\n\nsettled principle of our prior cases, we straightforwardly declared, “[a]\n\nviolation of the state and federal constitutional provisions against the\n\nunreasonable invasion of a person’s home gives the injured party a right\n\nof action for damages for unlawful breaking and entering.” Id. Thus, a\n\ndamages action for constitutional violations of search and seizure under\n\nthe Iowa Constitution was thoroughly well settled in Iowa law decades\n\nbefore the United States Supreme Court embraced the same concept in\n\nBivens. See Krehbiel, 142 Iowa at 680, 121 N.W. at 380.\n\n      While we held that search and seizure provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are self-executing in Girard, we came to a different\n\nconclusion on article IV, section 10 of the Iowa Constitution regarding\n\nthe holding of elections to fill vacancies for office. In Claussen, we came\n\nto the commonsense conclusion that this provision was not self-\n\nexecuting.   216 Iowa at 1091, 250 N.W. at 200.          The constitutional\n\nprovision itself failed to provide the necessarily detailed framework for\n\f                                       36\n\nimplementing elections, referring to situations which occurred when “no\n\nmode is provided by the Constitution and laws for filling such vacancy”\n\nin offices.   Id. at 1083, 250 N.W. at 197 (quoting Iowa Const. art. IV,\n\n§ 10).    If the vacancy were to be filled by “election of the people,” the\n\nGeneral Assembly had to provide the machinery for the election. Id. at\n\n1090, 250 N.W. at 200. The Iowa Supreme Court thus did not have the\n\nlegislative power to create the framework for a special election in the\n\nabsence of actions by other branches of government. Id. at 1091, 250\n\nN.W. at 200.\n\n         In Pierce, we considered a mandamus claim to require the Iowa tax\n\ncommission to meet and exercise its power to fairly apportion taxes. 229\n\nIowa at 24–26, 294 N.W. at 241–42. In passing, we stated the uniformity\n\nprovisions of the Iowa Constitution “are not self-executing, but require\n\nlegislative action to make them effective.” Id. at 29, 294 N.W. at 243. In\n\ncontext, however, the legislative action required referred to implementing\n\nlegislation to establish the machinery necessary to levy taxes. See id. It\n\ndid not relate to the question of whether a damage remedy could arise\n\nwhen the implementation of the uniformity provision by the state violated\n\nthe uniformity clause.       See id.   Indeed, there is language in Pierce\n\nsupportive of Godfrey’s position—\n\n         [W]here the law imposes a duty upon a state officer and his\n         refusal or failure to perform it affects injuriously . . . the\n         personal or property right of an individual, it cannot be that\n         the court is without power or authority to administer an\n         appropriate remedy.\n\nId. at 32, 294 N.W. at 245 (quoting McKeown v.

We held the plaintiff failed to state a claim on which relief\n\ncould be granted. Id. at 595. Cunha was narrowly interpreted by the\n\nfederal district court in McCabe, which regarded its holding as limited to\n\nthe question of whether a money damages remedy was available against\n\nlocal government and did not have anything to do with potential\n\nindividual liability. McCabe, 551 F. Supp. 2d at 785. In short, Cunha is\n\nsimilar to Meyer, where the Supreme Court declined to allow an action\n\nagainst a government agency on the ground there would no longer be a\n\nreason to bring actions against individual officers. See Meyer, 510 U.S.\n\nat 485, 114 S. Ct. at 1005.\n\n       Finally, in Van Baale, a terminated police officer sought to avoid\n\nthe limitations on remedies provided by a civil service commission ruling\n\nby bringing an action for money damages alleging a violation of equal\n\nprotection. 550 N.W.2d at 155. The plaintiff, however, failed to identify\n\nany group of persons who were treated differently by the defendants, and\n\nas a result, the equal protection claim failed as a matter of law. Id. at\n\n157.   We said, in dicta, that the equal protection clause was not self-\n\nenforcing, citing Katzenbach v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107256\"><a href=\"/opinion/107256/katzenbach-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107256\"><a href=\"/opinion/107256/katzenbach-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Katzenbach,\n\nhowever, involved a very different question than whether any provisions\n\nof a constitution were self-enforcing.        Instead, the question in\n\nKatzenbach was whether congressional power to implement the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was coextensive with\n\njudicial interpretation of the Clause or whether Congress possessed\n\nbroader power to extend remedies and protections than the Supreme\n\nCourt might employ in the absence of congressional legislation. See 384\n\nU.S. at 649, 86 S. Ct. at 1722. The question in Katzenbach had nothing\n\nto do with stand-alone judicial power under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\f                                   38\n\nSee id. And, the Supreme Court ultimately addressed the very issue in\n\nPassman, a case not cited by Van Baale, and came to the opposite\n\nconclusion. See Passman, 442 U.S. at 248–49, 99 S. Ct. at 2279.\n\n      E. Discussion.\n\n      1. Iowa constitutional tradition.   We begin our discussion by\n\nemphasizing the importance of the Bill of Rights in our scheme of\n\ngovernment.      Unlike the federal constitutional framers who did not\n\noriginally include a bill of rights and ultimately tacked them on as\n\namendments to the United States Constitution, the framers of the Iowa\n\nConstitution put the Bill of Rights in the very first article.   See Iowa\n\nConst. art. I.    Further, the record of the 1857 Iowa Constitutional\n\nConvention reflects a desire of its members\n\n      to put upon record every guarantee that could be legitimately\n      placed [in the constitution] in order that Iowa not only might\n      be the first State in the Union, unquestionably as she is in\n      many respects, but that she might also have the best and\n      most clearly defined Bill of Rights.\n\n      1 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Iowa\n\n100 (W. Blair Lord rep. 1867), http://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/\n\nservices/collections/law-library/iaconst. And, as noted by George Ells,\nChair of the Committee on the Preamble and Bill of Rights, “the Bill of\n\nRights is of more importance than all the other clauses in the\n\nConstitution put together, because it is the foundation and written\n\nsecurity upon which the people rest their rights.” Id. at 103; see Short,\n\n851 N.W.2d at 482.\n\n      While citation to a state motto may seem like parochial legal\n\nboosterism, the early Iowa legislature adopted a distinctly libertarian\n\nstate motto: “Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.”\n\nIowa Code § 1A.1.      Our founders did not cringe at the thought of\n\f                                      39\n\nindividual rights and liberties—they embraced them.            “It would be\n\nincongruous to hold that our constitution is a drier source of private\n\nrights than the federal constitution.” Kelley Prop. Dev., Inc. v. Town of\n\nLebanon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 924 (Conn. 1993) (Borden, J., dissenting);\n\nCorum, 413 S.E.2d at 290 (emphasizing the “primacy of the Declaration\n\n[of Rights] in the minds of the framers” and that “[t]he very purpose of\n\nthe Declaration of Rights is to ensure that the violation of these rights is\n\nnever permitted by anyone who might be invested under the Constitution\n\nwith the powers of the State”). In Bivens, Justice Harlan declared that\n\nthe Bill of Rights was “intended to vindicate the interests of the\n\nindividual in the face of the popular will as expressed in legislative\n\nmajorities.” 403 U.S. at 407, 91 S. Ct. at 2010 (Harlan, J., concurring).\n\nAs further noted by Justice Harlan,\n\n      I do not think that the fact that the interest is protected by\n      the Constitution rather than statute or common law justifies\n      the assertion that federal courts are powerless to grant\n      damages in the absence of explicit congressional action\n      authorizing the remedy.\n\nId. at 403, 91 S. Ct. at 2008.\n\n      The view was well expressed by Chief Justice Hughes of the New\nJersey Supreme Court several decades ago—“Just as the Legislature\n\ncannot abridge constitutional rights by its enactments, it cannot curtail\n\nthem through its silence, and the judicial obligation to protect the\n\nfundamental rights of individuals is as old as this country.” King v. S.\n\nJersey Nat’l Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2359787\"><a href=\"/opinion/2359787/king-v-so-jersey-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (N.J. 1974).\n\n      We agree with Justice Harlan and Chief Justice Hughes. If these\n\nindividual rights in the very first article of the Iowa Constitution are to be\n\nmeaningful, they must be effectively enforced. That is the point Justice\n\nHarlan made with such clarity in Bivens. According to Justice Harlan,\n\f                                       40\n\n“the judiciary has a particular responsibility to assure the vindication of\n\nconstitutional interests.” Bivens, 403 U.S. at 407, 91 S. Ct. at 2010. It\n\nwould be ironic indeed if the enforcement of individual rights and\n\nliberties in the Iowa Constitution, designed to ensure that basic rights\n\nand liberties were immune from majoritarian impulses, were dependent\n\non legislative action for enforcement. It is the state judiciary that has the\n\nresponsibility to protect the state constitutional rights of the citizens.\n\nSee Corum, 413 S.E.2d at 290.\n\n      It should be noted that the Iowa Constitution of 1857 tended to\n\nlimit the power of the legislature while it protected the independence of\n\nthe court. The Constitution of 1846 provided that the legislature appoint\n\njustices to the supreme court, but the Constitution of 1857 shifted that\n\npower away from the legislature and vested it in the people. Compare\n\nIowa Const. art. V, §§ 3, 16 (1857), with Iowa Const. art. VI, § 3 (1846).\n\nFurther, the Iowa Constitution of 1857 reflected a healthy skepticism of\n\nlegislative power by structuring the legislative process by allowing only\n\none subject in an act and prohibiting special laws, prohibiting the\n\ncreation of corporations though special laws, prohibiting the state from\n\nbecoming a stockholder in corporations or from paying corporate debts\n\nor liabilities, providing express limitations on banking, and by a\n\nrequirement that school funds be held in a segregated account. See Iowa\n\nConst. art. III, §§ 29, 30 (1857); id. art. IV, §§ 1, 4–11; id. art. VII, § 1; id.\n\nart. VIII, §§ 1, 3; id. art. IX:2, § 3. This effort to control legislative action\n\ncontrasts with the declarations of the founders regarding the robust\n\ncharacter of the Bill of Rights.       See David Schuman, The Right to a\n\nRemedy, 65 Temp. L. Rev. 1197, 1200 (1992) (noting popular distrust\n\nshifted from the courts to the legislatures and thus a “second wave” of\n\nstate constitutions stripped “legislatures of many of their prerogatives\n\f                                     41\n\nand vest[ed] increased power in the judiciary”); G. Alan Tarr, Interpreting\n\nthe Separation of Powers in State Constitutions, 59 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am.\n\nL. 329, 335 (2003) (describing the 19th century trend toward limiting\n\nlegislative power).   We cannot imagine the founders intended to allow\n\ngovernment wrongdoers to set their own terms of accountability through\n\nlegislative action or inaction. See Susan Bandes, Reinventing Bivens: The\n\nSelf-Executing Constitution, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. 289, 340–42 (1995).\n\n      As a rhetorical device, the defendants suggest that Bivens claims\n\nfor Iowa constitutional violations amount to a “new cause of action.” But\n\nwe face an old problem, not a new problem. The old problem is whether\n\ncourts   have   the   power   to   provide   an   appropriate   remedy   for\n\nconstitutional wrongs.\n\n      The notion that unconstitutional actions by government officials\n\ncould lead to compensatory and exemplary damages was well established\n\nin English common law. In the highly publicized and notorious related\n\ncases of Wilkes v. Wood, (1763) 98 Eng. Rep. 489 (C.P.), and Huckle v.\n\nMoney, (1763) 95 Eng. Rep. 768 (C.P.), the English courts considered\n\ncases arising out of unlawful searches and seizures conducted by Lord\n\nHalifax in an attempt to uncover the publishers of a caustic tract critical\n\nof the government in a newspaper. See William W. Greenhalgh & Mark\n\nJ. Yost, In Defense of the “Per Se” Rule: Justice Stewart’s Struggle to\n\nPreserve the Fourth Amendment’s Warrant Clause, 31 Am. Crim. L. Rev.\n\n1013, 1025 (1994).       In these cases, the juries awarded substantial\n\ndamages of £ 1000 and £ 300 pounds respectively. Wilkes, 98 Eng. Rep.\n\nat 499; Huckle, 95 Eng. Rep. at 768.\n\n      In Wilkes, the plaintiff’s attorneys argued the actions of Halifax\n\nwere an “outrage” and “wound” on the constitution. William J. Cuddihy,\n\nThe Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning 602–1791 447\n\f                                      42\n\n(2009). The Wilkes court recognized the damages awarded by the jury\n\nexceeded the injury.    Wilkes, 98 Eng. Rep. at 498.          According to the\n\ncourt, however,\n\n      a jury have it in their power to give damages for more than\n      the injury received. Damages are designed not only as a\n      satisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as a\n      punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding\n      for the future, and as proof of the detestation of the jury to\n      the action itself.\n\nId. at 498–99.\n\n      In Huckle, the amount of damages awarded was fifteen times the\n\nactual damages. The Court of the King’s Bench declared,\n\n      [T]he personal injury done to [Huckle] was very small, so that\n      if the jury had been confined by their oath to consider the\n      mere personal injury only, perhaps [£] 20 damages would\n      have been thought damages sufficient; but the small injury\n      done to the plaintiff, or the inconsiderableness of his station\n      and rank in life did not appear to the jury in that striking\n      light in which the great point of law touching the liberty of\n      the subject appeared to them at the trial . . . . I think they\n      have done right in giving exemplary damages. To enter a\n      man’s house by virtue of a nameless warrant, in order to\n      procure evidence, is worse than the Spanish Inquisition; a\n      law under which no Englishman would wish to live an hour;\n      it was a most daring public attack made upon the liberty of\n      the subject.\n\nHuckle, 95 Eng. Rep. at 768–69.\n\n      Another     similar   English   case   arising   from    Lord   Halifax’s\n\nindiscriminate searches was Entick v. Carrington, (1765) 95 Eng. Rep.\n\n807 (C.P.), cited by the United States Supreme Court as a “monument of\n\nEnglish freedom” and considered to be “the true and ultimate expression\n\nof constitutional law.” Boyd v.

The jury returned a\n\nspecial verdict for Entick in the amount of £ 300 if the search was\n\f                                     43\n\nunlawful, a verdict which was affirmed by the court.        Entick, 95 Eng.\n\nRep. at 811, 818.     Entick has been referred to as “perhaps the most\n\nimportant of all constitutional law cases to be found in the law reports of\n\nEngland; for it gave security under the law to all who may be injured by\n\nthe torts of government servants.” E.C.S. Wade, Liability in Tort of the\n\nCentral Government of the United Kingdom, 29 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1416, 1416–\n\n17 (1954).   All told, in cases arising out of the illegal searches and\n\nseizures associated with Lord Halifax, a total of £ 5700 was paid, a\n\nsubstantial sum of money in those days.            George C. Thomas III,\n\nStumbling Toward History: The Framers’ Search and Seizure World, 43\n\nTexas Tech. L. Rev. 199, 213–14 (2010).\n\n      It is thus not surprising that Justice Harlan noted in Bivens that\n\n“[h]istorically, damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for\n\nan invasion of personal interests in liberty.” Bivens, 403 U.S. at 395, 91\n\nS. Ct. at 2004; see also Widgeon, 479 A.2d at 924 (emphasizing\n\napplication of English precedents).        According to Justice Harlan,\n\ncontemporary modes of thought at the time of the United States\n\nConstitutional Convention reflected “modes of jurisprudential thought\n\nwhich appeared to link ‘rights’ and ‘remedies’ in a 1:1 correlation.”\n\nBivens, 403 U.S. at 400 n. 3, 91 S. Ct. at 2007 n.3; see John C. Jeffries,\n\nJr., Disaggregating Constitutional Torts, 110 Yale L.J. 259, 281 (2000)\n\n(“Rights cannot sensibly be crafted apart from remedies . . . .”).\n\n      Indeed, in one of our older precedents, we cited Entick using not\n\nonly a law book citation but a citation from Howell’s State Trials, a\n\npopular compendium of English state law cases. See Sanders v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (1855). Thus, the territorial Supreme Court of Iowa was\n\nwell aware of the practice of English courts to award damages for\n\nconstitutional violations.   Older cases from other states suggest that\n\f                                     44\n\nstate courts contemporaneous with the Iowa Constitutional Convention\n\nwere well aware of search and seizure developments in England and\n\nassumed that the state constitutional founders were well aware, too.\n\nSee, e.g., Lincoln v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (1855) (citing Entick and\n\ndeclaring the “controversy in England in relation to the validity of general\n\nwarrants was well understood by the framers of our state and United\n\nStates constitutions”); Fisher v.

Not surprisingly, there are a number of\n\nearly nineteenth century cases in which state courts imposed a damage\n\nremedy for constitutional violations, including punitive damages.      See,\n\ne.g., Grumon v. Raymond, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44 (1814) (“It would open a door\n\nfor the gratification of the most malignant passions, if [the issuance of a\n\ngeneral warrant] by a magistrate should s[c]reen him from damages.”);\n\nSimpson v.

The notion that a constitutional\n\ntort is somehow a creature of the twentieth century is thus incorrect.\n\nJeremy M. Christiansen, State Search and Seizure: The Original Meaning,\n\n38 U. Haw. L. Rev. 63, 82–84 (2016) (citing cases showing between 1814\n\nand 1923 numerous states recognized constitutional torts).\n\n      Further,   in   the   common   law   regime,   remedies   at   law—or\n\ndamages—were usually the first choice to remedy a protected right. It is\n\nequitable remedies, not damage remedies, which reflected the innovation\n\nin the common law.      See Harold J. Berman, The Origins of Historical\n\nJurisprudence: Coke, Selden, Hale, 103 Yale L.J. 1651, 1687–88 (1994);\n\f                                      45\n\nThomas O. Main, Traditional Equity and Contemporary Procedure, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wash.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 429, 464–67 (2003). Equitable remedies were generally\n\nthought to be available only after legal remedies were demonstrated as\n\ninadequate. See Samuel L. Bray, The System of Equitable Remedies, 63\n\nUCLA L. Rev. 530, 545 (2016).\n\n      The defendants’ ahistorical argument is thus upside down.            The\n\navailability of damages at law is thus an ordinary remedy for violation of\n\nconstitutional provisions, not some new-fangled innovation.         “The very\n\nessence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to\n\nclaim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.”\n\nMarbury, 5 U.S. at 163. The real question is thus not whether a new\n\ncause of action is being created, but instead is whether the provision in\n\nquestion is self-executing, thereby putting a court in a position to award\n\ntraditional damages.\n\n      2. Impact of Iowa Constitution article XII, section 1.              Iowa\n\nConstitution article XII—the last article in the document—is entitled\n\n“Schedule.” Section 1 provides, “This constitution shall be the supreme\n\nlaw of the state, and any law inconsistent therewith, shall be void. The\n\ngeneral assembly shall pass all laws necessary to carry this constitution\n\ninto effect.” Iowa Const. art XII, § 1.\n\n      Notably, section 1 uses the term “this” twice. “This” constitution\n\n(and not any earlier constitution) shall be the supreme law of the State.\n\nAnd the general assembly shall pass all laws necessary to carry “this”\n\nconstitution into effect. The double use of the term “this” in section 1\n\nsuggests a focus on transition issues and not a fundamental reworking of\n\nthe power of courts to fashion remedies.\n\n      The sections that followed in Article XII generally, but not always,\n\nrelated to transition issues. Sections 2 through 14 of the original version\n\f                                     46\n\nof Article XII dealt with various proceedings, fines inuring to the state,\n\nbonds in force, elections of state officers, the meeting and makeup of the\n\ngeneral assembly, the crafting of judicial districts, the submission of the\n\nConstitution to the people for approval, an election to strike the word\n\n“white” from various provisions of the Constitution. See Iowa Const. art.\n\nXII, §§ 2–14 (1857 original); Benjamin F. Shambaugh, The Constitutions\n\nof Iowa 279–80 (1934) [hereinafter Shambaugh].         At the very end, an\n\nunusual provision was tacked on, declaring that unless otherwise\n\ndirected by law, “the County of Mills shall be part of the sixth Judicial\n\nDistrict of the State.” Iowa Const. art. XII, § 15; see Shambaugh, at 342.\n\nThis latter provision has nothing to do with transition, and looks like a\n\nspecial concession made to someone who was at the right place at the\n\nright time.\n\n      The defendants contend that the sentence in section 1 that\n\nprovides, “The general assembly shall pass all laws necessary to carry\n\nthis constitution into effect” means that the provisions of the Iowa Bill of\n\nRights in article I are not self-executing but require legislative action to\n\nbe enforced. See Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1. Godfrey, on the other hand,\n\ncontends that article XII, section 1 only requires the general assembly to\n\npass laws “necessary” to carry “this” constitution in effect.\n\n      On this point, we agree with Godfrey.       In context, we think the\n\nclear meaning of article XII, section 1 is to require the general assembly\n\nto put “this” new constitution into operation and to provide for the\n\ntransition from government under the prior constitution to the new\n\nregime.       The language in article I, section 1 was not meant to\n\ndramatically undermine effective judicial enforcement of the Iowa Bill of\n\nRights by making remedies dependent upon legislative whim.\n\f                                             47\n\n       Further,      a   survey     of   the    original    1857      Iowa    Constitution\n\ndemonstrates the framers knew how to use language that required the\n\ngeneral assembly to act. There are several provisions of the constitution\n\nthat expressly require the general assembly to take certain actions to\n\nimplement it. 5\n\n       Such requirements of action by the general assembly are notably\n\nabsent from the Bill of Rights of article I of the Iowa Constitution with\n\ntwo exceptions. The general assembly “may authorize” a jury of less than\n\ntwelve under article I, section 9. Iowa Const. art. I, § 9. Additionally, the\n\ngeneral assembly “may provide” that persons may be held to answer for a\n\ncriminal offense without the intervention of a grand jury. Id. art. I, § 11.\n\nBut other than these two provisions, nothing in the Iowa Bill of Rights\n\nrequires legislative action to ensure enforcement.\n\n       We think it clear that section 1 of the schedule article cannot\n\nswallow up the power of the judicial branch to craft remedies for\n\nconstitutional violations of article I. The rights established in the Iowa\n\nBill of Rights are not established by legislative grace, but by the people in\n\n        5For example, article III, sections 34 and 35 provided that the general assembly\n\nshall fix the number of senators “by law,” and shall “fix” the ratio of representatives.\nIowa Const. art. III, §§ 34 & 35. Article IV, section 5 stated the general assembly shall\nprovide for contested elections “in such manner as may be prescribed by law.” Id. art.\nIV, § 5. Article IV, section 16 declared the Governor may remit fines and forfeitures in\nsuch manner “as may be prescribed by law.” Id. art. IV, § 16. Article V, section 12\nstated the general assembly shall “provide, by law” for the election of an attorney\ngeneral. Id. art. V, § 12. Article V, section 14, declared it is “the duty of the General\nAssembly to provide for the carrying into effect of this [judicial] article.” Id. art. V, § 14.\nArticle V, section 6 declared district courts shall have jurisdiction “as shall be\nprescribed by law.” Id. art. V, § 6. Article VIII, section 1 declared the general assembly\n“shall provide, by general laws” for the organization of all corporations. Id. art. VIII, § 1.\nArticle IX, section 5 declared the general assembly “shall take measures for the\nprotection, improvement, or other disposition” of public land. Id. art. IX:2, § 5. Article\nIX, section 7 declared that school funds may be distributed “as may be provided by the\nGeneral Assembly.” Id. art. IX:2, § 7. Article X, section 1 stated the general assembly\n“shall provide by law” for the publication of proposed amendments to the constitution\nand the election of delegates to the constitutional convention. Id. art. X, § 1.\n\f                                            48\n\nadopting the constitution. The Iowa Bill of Rights was a big deal to the\n\nframers. We divine no desire of the 1857 framers to prevent the Iowa\n\njudiciary from performing its traditional role from a schedule article\n\nrequiring the general assembly to enact necessary laws for the transition\n\nto the new constitutional government. See State v. Buckner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">290</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 (N.J. 2015) (noting a schedule article “contains various phase-\n\nin provisions designed to facilitate the smooth transition to the 1947\n\nconstitution and several subsequent amendments” (quoting Robert F.\n\nWilliams, The New Jersey State Constitution at 197 (2d ed. 2012)). The\n\nrights and remedies of the Bill of Rights are not subject to legislative\n\ndilution as “there is no elasticity in the specific guaranty of the\n\nConstitution.”       Des Moines Joint Stock Land Bank of Des Moines v.\n\nNordholm, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1367, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (1934) (Claussen,\n\nC.J., dissenting).       It would be a remarkable development to allow a\n\nprovision in the schedule article of the Iowa Constitution to eviscerate\n\nthe power of courts to provide remedies for violations of the people’s\n\nrights established in article I, the article which the framers plainly\n\nthought, bar none, contained the most important provisions in the Iowa\n\nConstitution. 6\n\n\n\n       6A   leading commentator of the Iowa Constitution, Benjamin F. Shambaugh,\nnotes that the proposed Iowa Constitution of 1844 contained an article XIII, he\ndescribes as “a ‘Schedule’ for transition from Territorial to State organization.”\nShambaugh, at 153. Shambaugh further notes that the Iowa Constitution of 1846 also\nhad a schedule article, article XIII. Id. at 197. It provided that the Governor should\nproclaim the time to hold the first general election within three months of the\nconstitution’s adoption, the Governor should set the date of the first meeting of the\ngeneral assembly, and that the first general assembly must meet within four months of\nratification. Id. at 197–98. With respect to the Iowa Constitution of 1857, Shambaugh\nnotes that article XII, also entitled “Schedule,” provided for election of officers under the\nnew constitution, a provision for submitting the constitution to the people for\nratification, and a provision for an election to strike the word “white” from the article on\nthe Right of Suffrage. Id. at 279–80. Shambaugh does not suggest that any of these\n\f                                         49\n\n       3. Standard for determining self-execution.          The federal standard\n\nfor self-execution was described in Davis—\n\n       A constitutional provision may be said to be self-executing if\n       it supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right given\n       may be enjoyed and protected, . . . and it is not self-\n       executing when it merely indicates principles . . . .\n\n                 . . . In short, if [it is] complete in itself, it executes\n       itself.\n\n179 U.S. at 403, 21 S. Ct. at 212. Ordinarily, a self-executing provision\n\ndoes not contain a directive to the legislature for further action.\n\nConvention Ctr. Referendum Comm. v. Bd. of Elections & Ethics, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">550</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552 (D.C. 1979). A provision is self-executing when it takes effect\n\nimmediately “without the necessity for supplementary or enabling\n\nlegislation.” Brown, 674 N.E.2d at 1137; see also Corum, 413 S.E.2d at\n\n289.\n\n       4. Application of self-execution standard to due process claims\n\ninvolving liberty and property interests. The United States Supreme Court\n\nconsidered whether claims under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution were enforceable in a\n\nBivens action in Passman, 442 U.S. at 230, 99 S. Ct. at 2269.                    The\n\nSupreme Court concluded that they were. Id. at 244, 99 S. Ct. at 2276.\n\nInstead of using the term “self-execution,” however, the Passman Court\n\nconsidered whether the plaintiff had a “cause of action,” due to how the\n\ncase was decided below and argued before the Court.                 Id. at 232, 99\n\nS. Ct. at 2270.        The Court concluded the ambiguous term “cause of\n\naction” meant, in Passman, whether the plaintiff had a judicially\n\nenforceable right under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\n________________________\n“Schedule” articles had dramatic implications for the scope of the rights and remedies\nestablished in article I of the any of the Iowa Constitutions.\n\f                                    50\n\na meaning essentially analogous to asking whether the Due Process\n\nClause was self-executing.    Id. at 239, 99 S. Ct. at 2274.    The Court\n\ndeclared that for the rights guaranteed in the Constitution to be more\n\nthan mere wishes or requests, litigants must be able to enforce those\n\nrights in the courts when there is no other effective means to enforce\n\nthem. Id. at 242, 99 S. Ct. at 2275. The Court explained it had long\n\nrecognized equal protection actions under the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFifth Amendment. Id.; see Bolling v.

Iowa courts have ensured, to\n\nuse Davis language, that “the right given may be enjoyed and protected.”\n\n179 U.S. at 403, 21 S. Ct. at 212.         The Iowa constitutional provision\n\nregarding due process of law is thus not a mere hortatory command, but\n\nit has been implemented, day in and day out, for many, many years. It\n\nhas traditionally been self-executing without remedial legislation for\n\nequitable purposes, and there is no reason to think it is not self-\n\nexecuting for the purposes of damages at law.\n\n      5. Application of self-executing standard to equal protection.        In\n\nPassman, the United States Supreme Court found that the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States\n\nConstitution was a self-executing provision sufficient to support a\n\nBivens-type direct damages action. 442 U.S. at 244, 99 S. Ct. at 2276.\n\nAccording to Passman, “the judiciary is clearly discernible as the primary\n\nmeans” through which the right to equal protection may be enforced. Id.\n\nat 241, 99 S. Ct. at 2275. The Passman Court quoted James Madison\n\nstating, when presenting the Bill of Rights to Congress, that when rights\n\nare incorporated into the Constitution, the judiciary will then consider\n\nthemselves the guardian of those rights and thus serve as “an\n\nimpenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the\n\nLegislative or Executive; [the judiciary] will be naturally led to resist every\n\nencroachment upon rights.” Id. at 241–42, 99 S. Ct. at 2275 (quoting 1\n\f                                       52\n\nAnnals of Congress 439 (1789)). The Equal Protection Clause was thus\n\nintended to be, and understood to be, enforceable by the judiciary. See\n\nid. at 244, 99 S. Ct. at 2276.\n\n      Similarly, in Brown, the Court of Appeals of New York held the New\n\nYork Constitution’s equal protection clause was self-executing.            674\n\nN.E.2d at 1137.     The Brown court explained that the right to equal\n\nprotection in the New York Constitution is “[m]anifestly” self-executing\n\nbecause it “define[s] judicially enforceable rights and provide[s] citizens\n\nwith a basis for judicial relief against the State if those rights are\n\nviolated.” Id. The equal protection provision “imposes a clear duty on\n\nthe State and its subdivisions to ensure that all persons in the same\n\ncircumstances receive the same treatment. Id. at 1140.\n\n      A number of other states have found the equal protection\n\nprovisions of state constitutions to be self-executing.

We therefore reaffirm the equal\n\nprotection clause of the Iowa Constitution is self-executing.\n\n      IV. Preemption of Iowa Constitutional Claims by the Iowa\nCivil Rights Act.\n\n      A. Introduction.     The defendants suggest that any potential\n\nconstitutional claim that Godfrey may have is preempted by the Iowa\n\nCivil Rights Act. At the outset, however, it is important to distinguish\n\nbetween preemption and the question of adequacy of the statutory\n\nremedy.\n\f                                            54\n\n      Preemption is a question of legislative intent.                    Ackerman v. Am.\n\nCyanamid Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2116530\"><a href=\"/opinion/2116530/ackerman-v-american-cyanamid-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211 (Iowa 1998). When the legislature\n\nexpressly preempts common law or other fields of law, there is no\n\nproblem of statutory interpretation. State v. Martinez, ___ N.W.2d ___,\n\n___ (Iowa 2017). The fighting issue in the preemption area is when the\n\nlegislature is silent but has enacted a sufficiently comprehensive statute\n\nto suggest an implied legislative intent to occupy the field or has enacted\n\na statute so in conflict with other legal claims that preemption must be\n\nimplied. See id. at ___.\n\n      The question of whether a statutory remedy might be adequate so\n\nas to avoid the need for a direct constitutional claim has nothing to do\n\nwith legislative intent.          It has everything to do with a judicial\n\ndetermination    of    whether      the     court     should       not    allow    a     direct\n\nconstitutional claim for damages to proceed because the court believes\n\nan   established      statutory     remedy       is    sufficient    to    vindicate       the\n\nconstitutional interests of the people expressed in the civil liberties\n\nprovisions of state constitutions.\n\n      B. Positions       of   the    Parties.          Godfrey      argues        that    Iowa\n\nconstitutional rights are not preempted by Iowa Code chapter 216.\n\nGodfrey points to differences between constitutional claims and common\n\nlaw claims, which may be preempted under the Iowa Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe sources of the rights are different and the available remedies are\n\ndifferent. Statutory rights may be abolished by the legislature, whereas\n\nconstitutional     rights     may    only     be      abolished      by     constitutional\n\namendment.\n\n      Godfrey      directs    our   attention         to   three    cases     from       other\n\njurisdictions as persuasive authority standing for the premise that\n\nconstitutional rights are fundamentally different from, and thus may not\n\f                                           55\n\nbe preempted by, statutory rights. See Laird v. Ramirez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1388742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1388742/laird-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

He also cites an Iowa case as standing for the\n\npremise       that   a   plaintiff   may   pursue    all   appropriate     remedies\n\nconcurrently. See Gray v.

In support\n\nof this argument, the defendants cite our cases holding that common law\n\ntorts are preempted by the Iowa Civil Rights Act.

The defendants state these and\n\nrelated cases stand for the rule that if discrimination is an element of a\n\nclaim, then the claim is not separate and independent from the Act and\n\nis thus preempted.\n\n       Because the operative facts that give rise to constitutional claims\n\nare the same facts as those that Godfrey relies on for his constitutional\n\nclaims, this proves, the defendants argue, the claims are not separate\n\nand independent from the Iowa Civil Rights Act.                     Therefore, the\n\ndefendants conclude the constitutional claims are preempted. 7\n\n\n       7The defendants make no direct or indirect argument in their brief with respect\nto the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671–80, the Iowa Tort Claims Act, Iowa\nCode chapter 669, or to the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

We\n\nexplained that employment contracts are presumed to be at-will under\n\nIowa law and we had not previously recognized a public policy exception\n\nto the rule. Id. at 196. The Iowa Civil Rights Act, however, allowed for\n\nsuch an action after following its procedures to first seek administrative\n\nrelief.    Id.   We said, “It is clear from a reading of [the Act] that the\n\nprocedure under the civil rights act is exclusive, and a claimant asserting\n\na discriminatory practice must pursue the remedy provided by the act.”\n\nId. at 197. The employee also raised a claim of intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress related to the discriminatory practice—the employer\n\ndid not argue that the emotional distress action was also preempted by\n\nthe Iowa Civil Rights Act because we did not consider the issue.

In these\n\ncases, however, the question of preemption does not appear to have been\n\nraised.\n\n      The long-settled principle is that a constitution trumps legislative\n\nenactments. See generally Marbury, 5 U.S. at 138 (“An act of congress\n\nrepugnant to the constitution cannot become a law.”); Baldon, 829\n\nN.W.2d at 803–10 (Appel, J., concurring) (describing the process of\n\nenacting state constitutions after independence and emphasizing the\n\nimportance of state constitutions in the federal system).

X, §§ 1–3.\n\n      If we held that a statute might preempt an otherwise valid\n\nconstitutional action, this would in effect grant ordinary legislation the\n\npower to cabin constitutional rights.        The Iowa Constitution would no\n\nlonger be the supreme law of the state. See Iowa Const. art. XII, § 1.\n\nThe amendment process in article X of the Iowa Constitution would be\n\nrendered superfluous.        We thus refuse to apply classic preemption\n\ndoctrine to the question of whether a Bivens-type damage remedy is\n\navailable under the Iowa Constitution.            See Greenway Dev. Co. v.\n\nBorough of Paramus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1926694\"><a href=\"/opinion/1926694/greenway-dev-co-inc-v-paramus/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 770 (N.J. 2000) (“A public entity may\n\nnot use a state statute . . . to abrogate a claimant’s constitutional\n\nrights.”); Wintergreen Grp., 171 P.3d at 420 (“A constitutional cause of\n\naction . . . is presumptively superior to and must displace any statutory\n\niteration that either conflicts with it or gives it less than full effect.”).\n\n      V. Judicial Inaction Due to Adequacy of Legislative Remedy.\n\n      A. Introduction.        We now consider a question different than\n\npreemption.     As indicated above, the central question in a preemption\n\nanalysis is determining what the legislature intended when it enacted a\n\nstatute.   On the issue of adequacy, the decision-maker is the court.\n\nSpecifically, the question here is whether the court believes the remedy\n\nprovided by the Iowa Civil Rights Act should be considered sufficiently\n\nrobust that the court should, as a matter of discretion, decline to allow\n\f                                    60\n\nplaintiff to pursue a parallel direct constitutional claim for money\n\ndamages.\n\n      B. Due Process Claims Based Upon Liberty and Property\n\nInterests. While much of Godfrey’s complaint focuses on discrimination\n\nbased on sex or sexual orientation, Godfrey also has alleged that his\n\nproperty and liberty interests in employment and in his reputation have\n\nbeen violated by the partisan motivation of the defendants. The claims\n\nare based on alleged violations of procedural and substantive due\n\nprocess.\n\n      The due process claims based on alleged partisan motivation in\n\ndepriving Godfrey of property and liberty interests contrary to due\n\nprocess are not claims within the scope of the Iowa Civil Rights Act. As a\n\nresult, there is no basis to assert that Iowa Code chapter 216 provides an\n\nadequate remedy to avoid the necessity of a free-standing damages claim.\n\nSee Passman, 442 U.S. at 247, 99 S.

As a result, the district court\n\nerred in dismissing Godfrey’s direct damages claim on these counts.\n\n      An amicus brief attacks the merits of Godfrey’s due process claims\n\nas being “vague” and generally inadequate.        The state defendants,\n\nhowever, did not advance this question before the district court or on\n\nappeal. One of the disadvantages of interlocutory appeal is the piecemeal\n\nconsideration of issues.     Nonetheless, the question of the merits of\n\nGodfrey’s property claim cannot be resolved at this time. It goes without\n\nsaying, of course, that we take no view on the merits of any due process\n\nclaim raised in this case.\n\f                                    61\n\n      C. Adequacy of Legislative Remedy Under the Iowa Civil\n\nRights Act. The Iowa Civil Rights Act provides a substantial remedy for\n\ndiscrimination of various kinds.         No one can doubt that it is a\n\nsubstantial remedy, allowing recovery for back wages, front wages,\n\nemotional distress, and attorneys’ fees.      There is caselaw from other\n\nstates supporting the general principle that a constitutionally adequate\n\nstatutory remedy may be sufficient to allow a court to decline to permit a\n\nparallel direct constitutional claim.

Americana\n\nHealthcare Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2016410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2016410/dilley-v-americana-healthcare-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (Ill.

On this\n\nissue, three members of the court conclude that the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\ndoes not preempt the plaintiff’s Bivens-type constitutional claims, while a\n\nmajority conclude that the district court properly dismissed Godfrey’s\n\nIowa constitutional claims based upon Iowa equal protection principles\n\nbecause of the adequacy of remedies under the Iowa Civil Rights Act.\n\nWhat follows is a discussion of why three members of the court conclude\n\nthe legislative remedy is inadequate and thus why the Bivens-type equal\n\nprotection claims should be allowed to proceed.\n\n      In considering whether we should consider the adequacy of the\n\nIowa Civil Rights Act for claims of discrimination in employment in\n\nviolation of the equal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution, there\n\nare two factors that give us pause. First, an independent constitutional\n\nclaim advances separate interests.       Second, the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\f                                     62\n\ndoes not allow punitive damages.

As Justice Harlan noted in Bivens,\n\n“[I]njuries inflicted by officials acting under color of law, while no less\n\ncompensable in damages than those inflicted by private parties, are\n\nsubstantially different in kind . . . .” Bivens, 403 U.S. at 409, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n2011.     When a constitutional violation is involved, more than mere\n\nallocation of risks and compensation is implicated. The emphasis is not\n\nsimply on compensating an individual who may have been harmed by\n\nillegal conduct, but also upon deterring unconstitutional conduct in the\n\nfuture. As noted by one commentator, punitive damages are available to\n\n“express sharp social disapproval” as well as prevent recurrence of\n\nunconstitutional conduct. Thomas J. Madden et al., Bedtime for Bivens:\n\nSubstituting the United States as Defendant in Constitutional Tort Suits,\n\n20 Harv. J. on Legis. 469, 489–90 (1983) (emphasis added).

Vindication of the social interest is\n\ndistinct from adequate compensation goals of tort law and most statutory\n\nremedies, including those under Iowa Code chapter 216.\n\n        Bivens, Carslon, and Smith thus teach that a constitutional claim\n\nis designed “to vindicate social policies which, by virtue of their inclusion\n\nin the Constitution, are aimed predominantly at restraining the\n\f                                        63\n\nGovernment as an instrument of popular will.” Rosalie Berger Levinson,\n\nRecognizing a Damage Remedy to Enforce Indiana’s Bill of Rights, 40 Val.\n\nU.

Historically, then, punitive damages played an important\n\nrole in the enforcement of individual rights against the government.\n\n      There is caselaw from the United States Supreme Court that\n\nsupports the importance of punitive damages in the panoply of\n\nconstitutional remedies.

As noted in Bivens, a\n\ngovernment official acting unlawfully in the name of the state “possesses\n\na far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising\n\nno authority other than his own.” 403 U.S. at 392, 91 S.

See Provens, 594 N.E.2d at 965 (holding statutory remedies\n\nadequate even though not equal to the other remedies that might be\n\navailable).    But the social interest in enforcement of constitutional\n\nclaims. supported by punitive damages as in Wilkes, Huckle, and Entick,\n\ndemonstrates the distinctive nature of constitutional harms.\n\n      An amicus brief raises the concern about dampening the ardor of\n\nthe Governor and other public officers in the exercise of their duties. But\n\nthis argument, in fact, cuts in favor of a cause of action for damages.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of powerful public figures who, in their\n\ndesire to do good, have trampled on the constitutional rights of the\n\npeople. As Justice Brandeis observed, “Experience should teach us to be\n\nmost on our guard to protect liberty when the government’s purposes are\n\nbeneficent.” Olmstead v.

The state courts that have considered\n\nwhether immunity applies in Bivens-type actions are divided. See, e.g.,\n\f                                   67\n\nMoresi, 567 So. 2d at 1093 (holding qualified immunity applies); Corum,\n\n413 S.E.2d at 291 (holding no qualified immunity). The issue of qualified\n\nimmunity, however, is not before the court today.\n\n      In conclusion, for the above reasons, we think the different nature\n\nof the interests protected weighs in favor of allowing a Bivens-type claim\n\nto go forward against the defendants. We do not find authority to the\n\ncontrary persuasive.\n\n      D. The Question of “Special Factors.” An amicus brief in this\n\ncase suggests that we should decline to find a direct monetary cause of\n\naction in this case because of “special factors.” As the amici correctly\n\npoint out, the United States Supreme Court has developed a special-\n\nfactors doctrine which allows the Supreme Court to decline to permit a\n\ndirect damage action for a constitutional violation to go forward.    See\n\nUnited States v. Stanley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111954\"><a href=\"/opinion/111954/united-states-v-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678–84, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111954\"><a href=\"/opinion/111954/united-states-v-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The question of\n\nwhether special factors are present under the United States Supreme\n\nCourt cases goes to the appropriateness of the remedy, not to the court’s\n\nremedial power.\n\n      The special-factors doctrine is a standardless exception that\n\nprovides the court with a convenient escape hatch.     In other words, a\n\nBivens claim exists except where a majority of the court finds it\n\ninconvenient.     To the extent it has any appeal, the special-factors\n\nexception has some purchase when applied to the federal government’s\n\nmilitary operations. In Chappell, the Supreme Court held that because of\n\nthe unique disciplinary structure of the military, it would not allow a\n\nBivens-type action by an enlisted seaman who brought a discrimination\n\nclaim against superiors. 462 U.S. at 304, 103 S. Ct. at 2368. Further,\n\nthere is at least arguably a textual commitment to a different\n\f                                     68\n\nconstitutional regime arising under the powers of the President as\n\ncommander-in-chief.\n\n        But we see no basis for implementing a special-factors doctrine\n\nhere. First, there is a preservation problem. The issue of special factors\n\nwas not raised in the State’s appellate brief. See Meier v.

Second, on the facts presented, we are not prepared to\n\nannounce the adoption of the amorphous, ad hoc special-factors\n\ndoctrine. Instead, as noted above, concerns about dampening the ardor\n\nof executive officials should be addressed through other channels such\n\nas the availability of qualified immunity.\n\n        VI. Conclusion.\n\n        For the above reasons, the holding of the district court in this\n\nmatter is reversed as to Counts VI and VII. We emphasize our holding is\n\nbased solely on the legal contentions presented by the parties.

In Carlson, a plaintiff alleged that his\n\ndue process, equal protection, and protection from cruel and unusual\n\npunishment rights were violated because prison officials failed to provide\n\nhim with proper medical attention while he was in their custody. Id. at\n\n16, 100 S. Ct. at 1470.     The Court asked whether the Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act (FTCA) provided the exclusive remedy for the plaintiff. Id. at\n\f                                    70\n\n18–19, 100 S. Ct. at 1471.      But because the FTCA explicitly barred\n\npunitive damages, the Carlson Court found the FTCA “is that much less\n\neffective than a Bivens action as a deterrent to unconstitutional acts.”\n\nId. at 22, 100 S. Ct. at 1473.           The Court emphasized, without\n\nqualification, that punitive damages are “especially appropriate to\n\nredress the violation by a Government official of a citizen’s constitutional\n\nrights.” Id.\n\n      Here, however, the remedies provided in the ICRA are robust, even\n\nwithout punitive damages. I find these remedies suffice as an adequate\n\ndeterrent of any alleged unconstitutional conduct.        First, as to the\n\nreduction in salary, Godfrey makes no claim that an action under the\n\nICRA will not adequately provide him with compensatory damages.\n\nFurther, the ICRA includes a provision for attorney fees. See Iowa Code\n\n§ 216.15(9)(a)(8).   Obviously, attorney fees cannot replace punitive\n\ndamages in cases of physical invasion, assault, or violations of other\n\nliberty interests, but their availability for a claim of monetary loss is an\n\nimportant factor in assessing the adequacy of a statutory remedy. See\n\nCarlson, 446 U.S. at 22, 100 S. Ct. at 1473. Regarding Godfrey’s claim of\n\nharassment, it is true this is not solely for monetary loss.       Instead,\n\nGodfrey additionally claims emotional distress damages. But the ICRA\n\nprovides for this, too. See Iowa Code § 216.15(9)(a)(8); see also Dutcher\n\nv.

Again, Godfrey makes no\n\nclaim that an action under the ICRA will not adequately compensate him\n\nfor damages relating to the alleged unconstitutional conduct.       Thus, I\n\nwould find the ICRA an adequate remedy for these claims and would not\n\f                                            71\n\nrecognize      an     independent      constitutional    claim      under    these\n\ncircumstances.\n\n      In the appropriate case, a remedy of punitive damages may be\n\nnecessary to vindicate a plaintiff’s constitutional rights. But when the\n\nclaimed harm is largely monetary in nature and does not involve any\n\ninfringement of physical security, privacy, bodily integrity, or the right to\n\nparticipate in government, and instead is against the State in its capacity\n\nas an employer, the ICRA exists to vindicate the constitutional right to be\n\nfree from discrimination.          While not providing punitive damages, it\n\nprovides full compensation and attorney fees. On these facts, I do not\n\nbelieve an independent Bivens-type action is necessary for the sole\n\npurpose of providing a punitive-damages remedy.\n\n      For these reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\nAccordingly,    the     district    court    properly   dismissed    Count    VIII\n\n(discrimination based on sexual orientation against the State) and\n\nCount IX (discrimination based on sexual orientation against the\n\nindividual defendants) to the extent the individual defendants are\n\nemployers or supervisors.          It is unnecessary to create a constitutional\n\ntort for these claims because adequate statutory remedies exist.\n\f                                     72\n                                                    #15–0695, Godfrey v. State\nMANSFIELD, Justice (dissenting).\n\n      I respectfully dissent.\n\n      I. Introduction.\n\n      Until today, we have never recognized direct claims under the Iowa\n\nConstitution even for actual damages. Historically the Iowa Constitution\n\nhas   been,   and   continues   to   be,    a   vital   check   on   government\n\nencroachment of individual rights.         Our courts enforce that check by\n\ninvalidating and enjoining actions taken in violation of the constitution.\n\nBut we have heretofore indicated that damages claims require either\n\n(1) legislative authorization or (2) a footing in the common law of torts,\n\ncontracts, or some other established common law doctrine. The appeal\n\nbefore us presents neither.\n\n      In 1965, our general assembly passed the Iowa Civil Rights Act\n\n(ICRA). See 1965 Iowa Acts ch. 121 (codified as amended at Iowa Code\n\nch. 216 (2009)). From the beginning, the ICRA has applied to “the state\n\nof Iowa or any political subdivision, board, commission, department,\n\ninstitution, or school district thereof.”       Iowa Code § 105A.2(5) (1966).\n\nToday, we learn that the general assembly need not have bothered.\n\nApparently, people who believed they had a civil rights claim against\n\nIowa state or local officials always had a money-damages cause of action,\n\nwith both actual and punitive damages available. It just took from 1857\n\nuntil 2017 for someone to figure it out.\n\n      I disagree with the notion that constitutional monetary damage\n\nclaims are some kind of time capsule that the drafters of our constitution\n\nburied in 1857 and that can only be unearthed now through the legal\n\nacumen of this court.     The time capsule hasn’t been found until now\n\nbecause no one buried it in the first place.             Our framers did not\n\f                                       73\n\nanticipate   that    someone   could    simply   walk   into   court   with   a\n\nconstitutional provision in hand and file a lawsuit to recover money,\n\nincluding punitive damages. Thus, they provided in article XII, section 1,\n\n“This constitution shall be the supreme law of the state, and any law\n\ninconsistent therewith, shall be void. The general assembly shall pass all\n\nlaws necessary to carry this constitution into effect.” Iowa Const. art.\n\nXII, § 1 (emphasis added).\n\n      This constitutional text forecloses the plaintiff’s argument and\n\nshould be the starting-point for analysis, so I will discuss it first (see\n\nPart II below).     I will then discuss the authority put forward by the\n\nmajority for the view that a private right of action exists under the Iowa\n\nConstitution (see Part III).   Upon examination, the cases cited by the\n\nmajority demonstrate only that we allow common law torts.\n\n      Thereafter, I will turn to a second line of analysis (see Part IV).\n\nEven if constitutional monetary damage claims were available in Iowa\n\nwithout legislative authorization or a common law basis, they would not\n\nbe available to remedy discrimination based on sexual orientation. That\n\nis because the legislature has already adopted a comprehensive remedial\n\nscheme to which the plaintiff has access. On this point, a majority of the\n\ncourt shares my view.\n\n      The plaintiff has invoked that comprehensive scheme in the first\n\ntwo counts of his petition, which were filed under the ICRA and are not\n\npart of this appeal. Nothing we do today affects those counts. Still, we\n\nare upholding the dismissal of all equal protection claims against the\n\nState and against the individual defendants acting within the scope of\n\ntheir employment.\n\f                                           74\n\n       Next, I will examine the lead opinion’s conclusion that there is a\n\nright to recover punitive damages against the State of Iowa (see Part V). 9\n\nLeading up to today’s decision, the State was the only defendant in this\n\ncase, and I expect that to continue after today’s decision. Meanwhile, the\n\npremise of the lead opinion is that there is a constitutional right to sue\n\nthe State of Iowa under the Iowa Constitution for punitive damages in\n\nappropriate cases.        This would be a drastic turnabout in Iowa’s legal\n\nhistory. We have never recognized a right to recover punitive damages\n\nfrom the State in any circumstance. To do so without the State’s consent\n\nwould violate sovereign immunity. The State has never waived sovereign\n\nimmunity as to punitive damages, presumably because it believes that\n\ntaxpayer dollars should not be used to pay punitive damage awards as\n\nopposed to funding State programs.\n\n       Finally, in the last part of this dissent, I will discuss what I believe\n\nto be the limits of today’s ruling for this litigation, contrasting those\n\nlimits with the rather broad and uncertain implications of the case for\n\nIowa as a whole (see Part VI).\n\n      II. The Majority Incorrectly Downplays the Text of Article XII,\nSection 1, Which Controls the Outcome Here.\n\n       Any logical analysis of the issues in this case should begin with the\n\nrelevant constitutional language in article XII, section 1. Unfortunately,\n\nit takes the court until page 45 to discuss this provision.\n\n       Article XII, section 1 stands for two propositions.                First, in the\n\nevent of a conflict between a law and the constitution, the constitution\n\n\n\n\n        9As I read it, the opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part takes no final\n\nposition on this issue.\n\f                                     75\n\nwins. Second, the constitution is implemented through laws passed by\n\nthe general assembly.\n\n      To put it another way, the constitution has both negative and\n\npositive force.   On the negative side, the constitution is a brake that\n\ninvalidates contrary laws.      On the positive side, the constitution\n\nempowers the general assembly to enact any laws needed to achieve its\n\npurposes.\n\n      In 1859, when the adoption of the Iowa Constitution was still fresh\n\nin the minds of everyone, our court read the second sentence of\n\narticle XII, section 1 in precisely this manner:\n\n             The constitution provides that offenses of a certain\n      grade, shall be tried originally before justices of the peace,\n      and that the latter have exclusive original jurisdiction in\n      such cases.      Constitution, Article 1, section 11.         The\n      Constitution requires the legislature to pass all laws\n      necessary to carry the same into effect. Cons., Article 12,\n      section 1. For the purpose of carrying out this requirement\n      of the constitution, the legislature, at its last session, passed\n      an act reducing the punishment in cases of persons\n      convicted of petit larceny, so as to bring it within the\n      constitutional requirement, that such class of offenses be\n      prosecuted originally before justices of the peace. By the\n      combined force of the constitution, and the laws of the last\n      session, the district court was ousted of jurisdiction in such\n      cases. Session Laws of 1858, 55.\n\nState v. Church, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cl. Ch.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254 (Iowa 1859).\n\n      A later case reiterates this point. In Duncan v. City of Des Moines,\n\nwe quoted both sentences of article XII, section 1 and explained, “Our\n\nConstitution makers wanted to make sure that this would be the rule\n\nadopted. It announced to the people, ‘We are turning the power of the\n\nState over to the legislature, but turning it over under the conditions\n\nnamed.’ ” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 (1936).\n\n      The majority overstates. It urges that without today’s decision, the\n\njudicial branch would lack power “to craft remedies for constitutional\n\f                                     76\n\nviolations of article 1.”   This ignores the first sentence of article XII,\n\nsection 1, which indicates that the Iowa Constitution, including the bill\n\nof rights, is supreme and inconsistent laws are void.     We enforce this\n\nnegative check on a regular basis, invalidating actions taken by state and\n\nlocal governments under color of law. And as part of this negative check\n\nwe have crafted remedies, such as the exclusionary rule and declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief, implementing the basic directive of article XII,\n\nsection 1 that unconstitutional acts are void.\n\n      What we have not done in the past 160 years is to go beyond\n\ndeclaring unconstitutional actions “void,” which we are authorized to do\n\nby the first sentence, and assume the legislature’s role under the second\n\nsentence.   Thus, we have never before permitted damages lawsuits for\n\nalleged constitutional violations to go forward in the absence of\n\nunderlying legislative authority or a recognized common law cause of\n\naction. It is simply stunning to me that the majority thinks we need to\n\nstart allowing such lawsuits today in order to avoid “dramatically\n\nundermin[ing] effective judicial enforcement of the Iowa Bill of Rights.”\n\nHas judicial enforcement been lax up until now?\n\n      Rhode Island has the same provision as article XII, section 1 in its\n\nconstitution and its supreme court has read it the same way as I do. See\n\nR.I. Const. art. VI, § 1; Bandoni v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2257808\"><a href=\"/opinion/2257808/bandoni-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (R.I. 1998). In\n\nBandoni, the plaintiffs sought to bring a damages action for alleged\n\nviolations of a victims’ rights provision contained in the Rhode Island\n\nConstitution. Id. at 583.\n\n      The extensive discussion that we have given to this issue\n      alone indicates the enormous danger of judicially creating a\n      cause of action when both the constitutional framers and the\n      members of the General Assembly had the same opportunity\n      to create a remedy and yet declined to do so. Instead we are\n      of the opinion that the creation of a remedy in the\n\f                                     77\n      circumstances presented by this case should be left to the\n      body charged by our Constitution with this responsibility.\n      See R.I. Const. art. 6, sec. 1 (“The general assembly shall\n      pass all laws necessary to carry this Constitution into\n      effect[.]”).    In this forum the myriad complex issues\n      presented by the imposition of liability can be fully debated\n      in public. . . .\n                ....\n            Under our form of government, . . . the function of\n      adjusting remedies to rights is a legislative responsibility\n      rather than a judicial task, and up until the present time the\n      Legislature has not provided a remedy for those instances in\n      which officials fail to inform crime victims of their rights.\n\nId. at 595–96.\n\n      The equal protection clause in the Michigan Constitution ends with\n\nlanguage similar to the second sentence of article XII, section 1.      It\n\nprovides, “The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate\n\nlegislation.”    Mich. Const. art. I, § 2.   Relying on this language, the\n\nMichigan Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who allegedly had been a\n\nvictim of racial discrimination could not pursue a direct action under the\n\nMichigan equal protection clause. See Lewis v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849167\"><a href=\"/opinion/849167/lewis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n868, 872 (Mich. 2001). The court reasoned,\n\n             On its face, the implementation power of Const. 1963,\n      art. 1, § 2 is given to the Legislature. Because of this, for\n      this Court to implement Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2 by allowing,\n      for example, money damages, would be to arrogate this\n      power given expressly to the Legislature to this Court.\n      Under no recognizable theory of disciplined jurisprudence do\n      we have such power.\n\nId. at 871. Noting the distinction blurred by the majority in this case,\n\nthe Michigan Supreme Court added,\n\n      [O]ur holding should not be construed as a demurral to the\n      traditional judicial power to invalidate legislation or other\n      positive governmental action that directly violates the equal\n      protection guarantee of Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2. There is\n      obviously a distinction between a judicial decree invalidating\n      unconstitutional governmental action and the adoption of\n      judicially created doctrines that effectively serve as de facto\n      statutory enactments to implement Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2.\n\f                                    78\n\nId. at 871–72 (footnote omitted).\n\n      During the debates on adoption of the 1857 Constitution, the\n\ndelegates appeared to recognize that constitutional damages suits\n\nagainst the State required separate authorization.       At one point the\n\ndelegates discussed adding language authorizing damage suits against\n\nthe State if the State took away privileges or immunities it had previously\n\ngranted. 1 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of\n\nIowa 104 (W. Blair Lord rep., 1857), www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services\n\n/collections/law-library/iaconst. One delegate criticized the proposal as\n\nnot going far enough, observing that “a citizen cannot sue the State.\n\nWhere is he to go, then, to get his damages?” Id. at 105.\n\n      When it was then proposed that the provision be strengthened to\n\nexpressly state that “the State shall be liable to an action at law in any\n\ncourt of record in this State,” id., another delegate responded,\n\n      I am opposed to the amendment . . . for I do not want to\n      ingraft anything upon the Constitution of the State of Iowa,\n      that will be liable to get the State into an innumerable\n      number of law suits. I do not believe in having the State\n      dragged into the courts of the State. I am opposed to this\n      thing here, and if anything of the sort is to be done, let the\n      legislature make the necessary provision for it.\n\nId. at 106.   A third delegate commented, “I do not believe it would be\n\npolitic to make a constitutional law that will be the means of getting the\n\nState into law suits, the end of which no man can foretell.” Id. A fourth\n\ndelegate spoke on “the impolicy of making the State a party to a suit at\n\nlaw, in courts of justice[;] and every mind recognizes the impolicy of that\n\npractice.” Id. at 110.\n\n      In the end, the provision was not adopted. Id. at 115. But the key\n\npoint is this: these framers understood the State generally could not be\n\f                                    79\n\nsued, even on a constitutional claim, without express authorization from\n\nthe constitution itself or from the general assembly.\n\n      Consistent with the text of article XII, section 1 and this history,\n\nwe have said on a number of occasions that the provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are not self-executing.

When we said in the foregoing cases\n\nthat the Iowa Constitution was not self-executing, we did not mean that\n\nit could not be raised as a defense (or a negative check, the phrase I\n\nused earlier). In fact, Edmundson and Halbach make the point that the\n\nIowa Constitution may be raised as a “defense,” Edmundson, 98 Iowa at\n\f                                            80\n\n647, 67 N.W. at 673, and “must be obeyed,” Halbach, 216 Iowa at 1091,\n\n250 N.W. at 200.          All we said is that you can’t bring an affirmative\n\nlawsuit for damages for violating the Iowa Constitution absent statutory\n\nauthority or a common law tort. The majority cites no Iowa case that has\n\never recognized such a claim.\n\n       The majority tries to sidestep the actual text of article XII, section 1\n\nby citing to other provisions in the Iowa Constitution expressly giving the\n\ngeneral assembly authority to legislate in particular areas. I don’t follow\n\nthe majority’s argument.          The majority can’t mean these are the only\n\nareas where the general assembly can pass laws. So what is their point?\n\n       Typically, these other provisions serve one of two purposes. Some\n\nspecify subject areas where the legislature must pass laws, such as the\n\nelection of an attorney general and the organization of corporations. See,\n\ne.g., Iowa Const. art. V, § 12; id. art. VIII, § 1. Others delineate areas\n\nwhere the legislature has greater discretion than usual. See, e.g., id. art.\n\nI, § 9; id. art. II, § 7.       Yet, in addition, and at the same time, the\n\nlegislature is exclusively vested with plenary authority to pass whatever\n\nother laws it deems “necessary” to implement the Iowa Constitution. See\n\nid. art. XII, § 1.10\n\n       The majority also places considerable reliance on the heading\n\n“Schedule” in article XII.        See id. art. XII.     Based on this heading, the\n\nmajority insists that the second sentence of article XII, section 1 is just a\n\ntemporary provision relating to the “transition” to the 1857 Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n       10For   example, contrast the language of article V, section 14 (“It shall be the\nduty of the general assembly to provide for the carrying into effect of this article, and to\nprovide for a general system of practice in all the courts of this state.”), with that in\narticle XII, section 1.\n\f                                       81\n\n       This contention likewise seems to me flawed. The first sentence of\n\narticle XII,   section 1,   Iowa’s   supremacy   clause,   is   clearly   not   a\n\ntransitional provision.     See Varnum v. Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1870141\"><a href=\"/opinion/1870141/varnum-v-brien/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 875–76\n\n(Iowa 2009) (discussing and relying upon the first sentence of article XII,\n\nsection 1).     So why would the very next sentence of section 1 be\n\ntransitional?    Significantly, a number of provisions of article XII have\n\nbeen omitted from the codified version of our constitution with the note\n\nthat they were “transitional.” See Iowa Const. art. XII (codified), reprinted\n\nin Iowa Code (2009) volume I at p. lvi. Section 1, however, is not among\n\nthem. See id.\n\n       A glance back at our 1846 Constitution further undermines the\n\nmajority’s position. Like the 1857 Constitution, the 1846 Constitution\n\nhad an article XIII entitled “Schedule.”     Iowa Const. art. XIII (1846).\n\nHowever, that article did not contain any counterpart to section 1. See\n\nid.   In fact, no counterpart to article XII, section 1 can be found\n\nanywhere in the 1846 Constitution. The 1846 article XIII was limited to\n\neight sections, all of which truly were transitional.      See id.    A logical\n\nconclusion is that our framers thought it was important for our 1857\n\nconstitution to include the nontransitory principles set forth in section 1\n\n(after all, the United States Constitution has a supremacy clause), and\n\ndecided that article XII was a convenient place to do so.\n\n       The majority also highlights the use of the word “this” in both\n\nsentences of article XII, section 1. I do not follow the point here, either.\n\nSection 1 uses this syntax because it is referring to the constitution that\n\nit is a part of, not some other constitution. “This” would be the normal\n\nsyntax and is used in the Supremacy Clause of the United States\n\nConstitution. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2 (“This Constitution . . . shall\n\nbe the supreme Law of the Land . . . .”).\n\f                                     82\n\n      In the end, the majority offers no explanation for what the second\n\nsentence of section 1 does mean, if it doesn’t have the meaning the\n\ndistrict court gave it.\n\n     III. The Majority Confuses Common Law Tort Damage Claims\nWith Damage Claims Based Only on the Iowa Constitution. The\nFormer Have Always Been Allowed; the Latter Have Not.\n\n      The majority asserts that we have previously allowed damage\n\nlawsuits for violations of the Iowa Constitution to proceed without\n\nlegislative authorization.   The majority is mistaken.     What we have\n\npermitted are traditional common law tort claims, such as trespass,\n\nconversion, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.\n\n      In McClurg v. Brenton, the mayor of Des Moines and “quite a\n\nretinue of followers” barged in on plaintiff’s home in the middle of the\n\nnight without a warrant, based on suspicion that the plaintiff had stolen\n\na neighbor’s chickens. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881–82 (1904).\n\n“The matter being tried was the alleged trespass upon plaintiff’s\n\nhome . . . .”   Id. at 374, 98 N.W. at 883.

Id. “Thereafter [the owner of the home] instituted\n\nthis action for damages, alleging that in suing out said warrant and\n\ncausing the search of his premises for alleged stolen property the [parent]\n\nacted willfully, maliciously, and without probable cause.” Id. at 678, 121\n\nN.W. at 379.     We held on appeal that the case should have been\n\nsubmitted to the jury because “the evidence tends very clearly to show\n\nboth malice and want of probable cause.” Id. at 680, 121 N.W. at 380.\n\n      Although     we   did   mention   article I,   section 8   of   the   Iowa\n\nConstitution, the cause of action was a recognized common law claim for\n\ntrespass and malicious prosecution.      Id. at 679–80, 121 N.W. at 379.\n\nNotably, the defendant was not a public official subject to article I,\n\nsection 8, but a private party—i.e., the disgruntled parent. Id. at 678–79,\n\n121 N.W. at 379.\n\n      The third case relied on by the majority, Girard v.

The plaintiff bought a piano from the defendant but fell behind\n\non the payments. Id.

We\n\nheld the plaintiff had triable claims as to both trespass and conversion.\n\nId. at 145, 257 N.W. at 401. The main issue in the case was whether the\n\ndefendant could rely on language in the piano sales contract to justify his\n\nagents’ entry into the plaintiff’s home. Id. We decided otherwise:\n\n             We are not willing to adopt a rule that will permit the\n      seller under a contract of this kind to take the law into his\n      own hands by forcibly retaking possession of property sold,\n      where any resistance is offered by the purchaser.\n\f                                            84\n\nId. at 149, 257 N.W. at 403.\n\n       In the course of our opinion in Girard, we quoted article I,\n\nsection 8, recognizing that it protects “the sacredness of the home.” Id.\n\nat 148, 257 N.W. at 402. We also cited McClurg and Krehbiel and said,\n\n“A violation of the state and federal constitutional provisions against the\n\nunreasonable invasion of a person’s home gives the injured party a right\n\nof action for damages for unlawful breaking and entering.” Id. at 148,\n\n257 N.W. at 403. But as in those two cases, the actual cause of action\n\nwas an established one under the common law. Id. at 145, 257 N.W. at\n\n401. To put it another way, these causes of action did not depend on the\n\nexistence of article I, section 8, but were traditional common law claims\n\nand would have gone forward even if article I, section 8 were not part of\n\nour constitution. The majority’s three cases need to be juxtaposed with\n\nthe caselaw already discussed where we said the provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution are not self-executing. 11\n\n     IV. The ICRA Remedy for the Alleged Discrimination Is\nExclusive and This Court Lacks Authority to Devise a Different\nRemedy That It Might Prefer.\n\n       Even when direct damage lawsuits have been permitted under\nother state constitutions (i.e., constitutions that do not have a\n\ncounterpart to article XII, section 1), they are typically not allowed when\n\nthe legislature already has devised a remedial system for the same\n\n\n\n       11The  court also mentions State v.

This,\nhowever, was a criminal case where our court rejected the applicability of the\nexclusionary rule in state criminal prosecutions. Id. at 107, 191 N.W. at 536. We did\nstate, “A trespassing officer is liable for all wrong done in an illegal search or seizure.”\nId. at 106, 191 N.W. at 535. We did not discuss the specific basis for liability—whether\nit was trespass or the Iowa Constitution. The use of “trespassing” in our sentence\nsuggests the former. We also did not discuss whether liability meant damages liability.\n\f                                      85\n\nwrong. Employment discrimination claims in Iowa are an area where the\n\nlegislature has devised such a remedial scheme.\n\n      In Iowa, the general assembly has directed that a person “claiming\n\nto be aggrieved by an unfair or discriminatory practice must initially seek\n\nan administrative relief,” and thereafter may bring a civil action under\n\nthe ICRA.

The Ohio and Illinois Supreme\n\nCourts, as well as a well-reasoned federal district court opinion\n\ninterpreting New York law, have all concluded that when a plaintiff’s\n\nconstitutional employment discrimination claim can also be pursued\n\nunder the state’s civil rights statutes, no separate constitutional claim is\n\navailable.\n\n      Thus, in Provens v. Stark County Board, the Ohio Supreme Court\n\ndeclined to recognize an independent cause of action under the Ohio\n\nConstitution for compensatory and punitive damages for discrimination.\n\n594 N.E.2d at 965–66. The plaintiff in Provens was a teacher at a state-\n\nrun school.    Id. at 959–60.    In her complaint, Provens alleged that\n\nsupervisors at the facility “had harassed, discriminated against, and\n\ndisciplined her,” and further retaliated against her because she had\n\ninitiated a lawsuit against employees of the board. Id. at 960. Provens\n\nsought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages.\n\nId. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the state, in\n\npart because “it would be inappropriate for the court to create a new\n\njudicial remedy.” Id. at 961.\n\f                                        89\n\n      On appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed.                   Id. at 966.\n\nAlthough the court noted that Provens had not specified which of her\n\nrights had allegedly been violated, after reviewing the record the court\n\ndetermined “a significant basis for the allegations contained in plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint were harassment claims with racial connotations.” Id. at 964.\n\nRelying on the United States Supreme Court decision in Bush, the court\n\nreasoned that the relevant question was not “what remedy the court\n\nshould provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unredressed,” but\n\ninstead,   “whether    an   elaborate    remedial   system   that    has   been\n\nconstructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy\n\nconsiderations, should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial\n\nremedy for the constitutional violation at issue.”      Id. at 963 (quoting\n\nBush, 462 U.S. at 388, 103 S. Ct. at 2416–17). Accordingly, the court\n\npointed out that the Ohio civil rights act “does provide the plaintiff with\n\nsome meaningful available relief.” Id. at 963; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n\nch. 4112 (West, Westlaw current through 2017 files 6, 8, and 9 of 132d\n\nGen. Assemb.).        Specifically, under Ohio law, if the Civil Rights\n\nCommission determines that an employer has engaged in an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory practice, the commission may order injunctive relief or\n\nany other action “including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement, or\n\nupgrading of employees with, or without, back pay.”            Provens, 594\n\nN.E.2d at 964 (quoting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 4112.05(G)). The court\n\nfurther noted that the plaintiff may have rights under the state’s\n\ncollective bargaining laws. Id. at 965.\n\n      With these principles in mind, the Ohio Supreme Court concluded,\n\n            While the remedies provided the plaintiff here through\n      the administrative process of a hearing before the [Civil\n      Rights Commission] and through the arbitration process\n      under the collective bargaining agreement do vary from the\n\f                                      90\n       remedies that might be available through a civil proceeding,\n       such difference shall not be controlling where, in the totality,\n       it may be concluded that the public employee has been\n       provided sufficiently fair and comprehensive remedies. . . .\n             ....\n        . . . [I]t is not incumbent upon this court to engage in the\n       type of comparative analysis of the relative merits of various\n       remedies that is invited by appellant. Rather, the more\n       appropriate course for this court is to defer to the legislative\n       process of weighing conflicting policy considerations and\n       creating certain administrative bodies and processes for\n       providing remedies for public employees such as appellant.\n             We hold, therefore, that public employees do not have\n       a private cause of civil action against their employer to\n       redress alleged violations by their employer of policies\n       embodied in the Ohio Constitution when it is determined\n       that there are other reasonably satisfactory remedies\n       provided by statutory enactment and administrative process.\n\nId. at 965–66.\n\n       Similarly, in Baker, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected an\n\nemployment       discrimination   claim    for   compensatory   and   punitive\n\ndamages brought directly under article I, section 17 of the Illinois\n\nConstitution. 636 N.E.2d at 552, 559. The court noted at the outset\n\nthat the guarantees of that constitutional provision—freedom from\n\ndiscrimination in housing and employment—had been legislatively\n\nimplemented through the Illinois Human Rights Act.          Id. at 553.   The\n\ncourt recognized that the Act was the exclusive remedy in Illinois for\n\nemployment discrimination, and “[t]herefore, a covered employee [under\n\nthat Act] may not bring a private cause of action to recover damages for a\n\nviolation of his rights under article I, section 17.” Id. at 554. The main\n\nissue in Baker was whether or not the plaintiff was covered under the\n\nAct.   See id.      Hence, after concluding she was covered, the court\n\nreasoned she was precluded from bringing a constitutional claim, in part\n\nbecause Act provided the plaintiff with “a comprehensive and systematic\n\f                                        91\n\nmechanism for the investigation and disposition of discrimination\n\nclaims.” Id. at 559.\n\n        Likewise, in Muhammad v. New York City Transit Authority, the\n\ncourt    rejected   the   plaintiff’s   attempt   to   constitutionalize   her\n\ndiscrimination claims against her employer, a public transit authority.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562922\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562922/muhammad-v-new-york-city-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The complaint raised\n\nvarious claims under federal law, state law, and the New York\n\nConstitution, several of which were subject to a pretrial motion to\n\ndismiss. Id. at 202.\n\n        Regarding the state constitutional claim, the court noted that the\n\nNew York Court of Appeals had previously recognized a damages remedy\n\nunder the state’s equal protection clause in Brown v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1141 (N.Y. 1996).         Muhammad, 450 F. Supp. 2d at 210–11.\n\nHowever, as the federal district court explained, “the Court of Appeals\n\nsubsequently characterized Brown as creating only a ‘narrow remedy.’ ”\n\nId. at 211 (quoting Martinez v. City of Schenectady, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563\n\n(N.Y. 2001)).   “In Brown itself, neither declaratory nor injunctive relief\n\nwas available to the plaintiffs . . . . For those plaintiffs it was damages or\n\nnothing.” Id. (quoting Martinez, 761 N.E.2d at 563). Hence, the district\n\ncourt contrasted Brown with the potential avenues available to the\n\nplaintiff in order to remedy employment discrimination—namely, New\n\nYork Human Rights Law. Id. at 212. The court concluded,\n\n               Defendant specifically notes that New York Human\n        Rights Law “prohibits discrimination in employment based\n        on religion, and expressly provides a private right of action\n        for an employee allegedly discriminated against on the basis\n        of his or her religion.”      Future, similar constitutional\n        violations may be deterred if plaintiff successfully exploits\n        that avenue.        Accordingly, recognition of a State\n        constitutional tort is unnecessary in this case to afford\n        plaintiff a remedy. [The claim] is, therefore, dismissed.\n\f                                      92\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n      Along    the   same    lines,   other     state   courts   have   allowed\n\nconstitutional claims in the employment context only when there appears\n\nto be no available statutory remedy.          In Corum v. University of North\n\nCarolina, the court indicated that the plaintiff had a direct damages\n\nremedy against his employer under the state constitutional provision\n\nprotecting freedom of speech.         </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1330834\"><a href=\"/opinion/1330834/corum-v-university-of-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290 (N.C. 1992).\n\nHowever, the court noted the “critical limitation[ ]” that the court “must\n\nbow to established claims and remedies where these provide an\n\nalternative to the extraordinary exercise of [the judiciary’s] inherent\n\nconstitutional power.”      Id. at 291.     Similarly, in Peper v. Princeton\n\nUniversity Board of Trustees, the court recognized the constitutional\n\ncause of action, but only after concluding that the plaintiff’s private-\n\nuniversity employer was not a statutorily-defined “employer” the\n\napplicable state discrimination laws.         </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2073924\"><a href=\"/opinion/2073924/peper-v-princeton-university-board-of-trustees/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 474, 478 (N.J.\n\n1978).\n\n      Maryland, which should be viewed as an outlier, has permitted\n\ndiscrimination claims under the Maryland state constitution despite the\n\navailability of a statutory remedy. See Manikhi v. Mass Transit Admin.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276684\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276684/manikhi-v-mass-transit/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110–11 (Md. 2000).           However, such state constitutional\n\nclaims are subject to a statutory damages cap in the Local Government\n\nTort Claims Act, which has been found applicable and enforceable to\n\nconstitutional claims. See Espina v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462–63 (Md.\n\n2015).   Hence, even if we applied the Maryland approach in Iowa, the\n\nstatutory bars to recovery of punitive damages in Iowa’s government tort\n\nlaws would be applicable and enforceable.\n\n      Here, as I have already noted, there is no dispute that Godfrey’s\n\nemployer, the State of Iowa, is an “employer” within the meaning of the\n\f                                          93\n\nICRA, see Iowa Code § 216.2(7), and thus in my view, the Act provides\n\nGodfrey with an adequate statutory remedy. The reasoning of the Ohio,\n\nIllinois, and New York courts is persuasive.\n\n       At best, article XII, section 1 might be read as requiring the general\n\nassembly to enact a damages remedy for constitutional violations. In the\n\nICRA, the legislature has done that with respect to employment\n\ndiscrimination by state and local officials.            Once the legislature has\n\nprovided a remedy, it is not the role of the judiciary to provide a different\n\nremedy unless the existing remedy is so deficient as to amount to a\n\ndenial of due process. 12\n\n       The ICRA’s language is mandatory and comprehensive. It provides\n\nthat a person claiming to be aggrieved by a discriminatory act “must”\n\nfollow the procedures therein.         Id. § 216.16(1).      We have no business\n\nstriking down the mandatory and exclusive language in the ICRA, and I\n\nam glad we are not doing so today.\n\n      V. The Lead Opinion Authorizes the State to be Sued for\nPunitive   Damages    in   Disregard  of   Sovereign   Immunity,\nLongstanding Tradition, and the Express Language of the Iowa Tort\nClaims Act.\n\n       The lead opinion cites the availability of punitive damages as its\n\njustification for authorizing a parallel article I, section 6 track to the\n\nexisting ICRA track. However, the Iowa Tort Claims Act (ITCA) does not\n\nallow punitive damages to be awarded against the State. Id. § 669.4. In\n\nother words, the State has not waived sovereign immunity as to punitive\n\n\n\n       12The lead opinion tries to pigeonhole the defendants’ argument as one of classic\npreemption. The issue is not classic preemption in the sense that one law invalidates\nanother law, but an issue of whether this court should establish a damages remedy of\nits own liking for allegedly unconstitutional conduct when the legislature has already\ndone so.\n\f                                            94\n\ndamages, and I am not aware of an Iowa court having refused to honor\n\nthis limit. 13\n\n       A full discussion of this issue requires some clarity about the\n\nparties to this case.        Originally, the attorney general certified that all\n\nindividual defendants named in this petition were acting in their official\n\ncapacities with respect to all claims.            See id. § 669.5(2)(a); Godfrey v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581 (Iowa 2014). This resulted in the dismissal\n\nof the individual defendants from the lawsuit. Id. at 581–82. However,\n\nin an earlier appeal, we reversed that dismissal in part. Id. at 588. We\n\nheld the certification did not apply to claims brought against the\n\nindividual defendants “in their individual capacities,” i.e., to the extent\n\nthese defendants were not “acting within the scope of their employment.”\n\nId. at 586.      Still, we said that the individual defendants could “file a\n\nmotion for summary judgment to resolve this issue.” Id.\n\n       Subsequently, the defendants filed two separate motions for partial\n\nsummary judgment.            One was to dismiss the constitutional claims\n\n(Counts VI through IX) against all defendants based on the absence of a\n\nprivate right of action. The other was to dismiss the remaining claims\n\nagainst the individual defendants on the ground they had acted only in\n\ntheir official, not individual, capacities. The first motion was granted and\n\nis the subject of the present appeal. The plaintiff then conceded he had\n\nno factual basis for opposing dismissal of any remaining claims against\n\n\n\n       13The  lead opinion observes that the State did not discuss sovereign immunity in\nits appellate brief. If the lead opinion is trying to make a point about error preservation,\nit is simply wrong. The State was the appellee; Godfrey was the appellant. In his\nbriefing, Godfrey did not argue punitive damages as a reason for allowing\ndiscrimination claims based on article I, section 6 in Iowa. The State thus had no\nopportunity—let alone the obligation—to rebut an argument that Godfrey did not make,\nand that was developed for the first time in today’s lead opinion.\n\f                                        95\n\nthe individual defendants, so those claims were voluntarily dismissed.\n\nAs a result, the State of Iowa is presently the only defendant in this case.\n\n      While today’s decision has the effect of reinstating some of the\n\nconstitutional claims, those claims appear to involve exclusively actions\n\ntaken by the defendants in their official capacities.            Count VI under\n\narticle I, section 9 of the Iowa Constitution challenges the conduct of the\n\ndefendants    in   “demanding      Plaintiff’s   resignation”    and   “drastically\n\nreducing Plaintiff’s salary.” Count VII, likewise brought under article I,\n\nsection 9, alleges the defendants “deprived Plaintiff of a protected liberty\n\ninterest by stigmatizing Plaintiff, by publicly and falsely claiming that\n\ntheir illegal and unreasonable demands for his resignation and ultimate\n\nreduction in his pay were due to Plaintiff’s poor work performance.”\n\nCount IX alleges that the defendants deprived the plaintiff of equal\n\nprotection in violation of article I, section 6 when they slandered the\n\nplaintiff and reduced his salary. 14\n\n      Thus, when the dust settles below, I think it is clear that the State\n\nwill remain the only defendant. Regardless of the ultimate merits of the\n\nplaintiff’s constitutional claims, they concern actions taken by the\n\nindividual defendants in their official capacities.          Any request to the\nplaintiff to resign or effort to reduce his salary would have been\n\nundertaken in that defendant’s official capacity.          And the plaintiff has\n\nalready conceded, when he accepted the dismissal of his common law\n\ndefamation claims, that he “has been unable to develop evidence that the\n\nindividual   Defendants     were     acting      outside   the   scope   of   their\n\nemployment” when they made the allegedly defamatory comments.\n\n\n       14The fourth constitutional claim, Count VIII, names only the State as a\n\ndefendant.\n\f                                          96\n\n       Moreover, the plaintiff has previously conceded in this litigation\n\nthat he is not entitled to punitive damages against the State.                     See\n\nGodfrey, 847 N.W.2d at 581 (quoting plaintiff’s counsel). So if that is the\n\njustification for creating a direct cause of action against the State under\n\nthe Iowa Constitution, it is a strange one.              The plaintiff has already\n\ndisavowed this ground. 15\n\n       Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the State is immune\n\nfrom tort liability “[e]xcept where consent has been given by the\n\nlegislature.” Montandon v.

Id. at 238 (“There can be but one satisfaction for\n\na wrong.”).\n\n      The defendant filed a petition for rehearing, “in which it [was]\n\nstrenuously urged that the foregoing opinion ignores the maxim that, The\n\nking can do no wrong.” Id. at 239.

Relying on the\n\nBlackstone Commentaries, we said,\n\n      Perhaps [the maxim] means that, although the kind is\n      subject to the passions and infirmities of other men, the\n      constitution has prescribed no mode by which he can be\n      made personally amenable for any wrong which he may\n      actually commit.

Clearly the power\n      of the courts to restrain state officials from violating plain provisions of\n      the statute and Constitution is in no way derogatory to the general and\n      well-recognized rule that the state cannot be sued without its consent.\nHoover v.

But our\n\nprecedent is to the contrary. We earlier concluded that except as waived\n\nby the legislature, sovereign immunity applies even when an alleged\n\ndeprivation of constitutional rights is involved. For example, in Sanford,\n\nwe affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff’s damages claim “for the\n\ndeprivation of good-conduct time” in prison, something that clearly\n\ninvolved a liberty interest. 601 N.W.2d at 370–72. Similarly, the plaintiff\n\nin Yoerg claimed that a state commission’s failure to remit an excise tax\n\nresulted in a violation under the Iowa Constitution. 244 Iowa at 1379,\n\n60 N.W.2d at 567.      Nonetheless, we determined “the suit against the\n\f                                       100\n\ncommission was substantially against the state, which was immune\n\ntherefrom.” Id. at 1387, 60 N.W.2d at 571.\n\n      Recognizing that the doctrine of sovereign immunity may bar\n\nconstitutional damage claims is not some novel concept. In Figueroa v.\n\nState, the Hawaii Supreme Court declined to create a private right of\n\naction for damages based on provisions of the Hawaii Constitution, in\n\npart because the court determined it was “not free to abolish the State’s\n\nsovereign immunity.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1205 (Haw. 1979). Notably, the\n\nFigueroa     court   reached    that   conclusion   even   though   the   state\n\nconstitution expressly provided that all of its provisions are self-\n\nexecuting. Id. at 1206. The court reasoned:\n\n      The self-executing clause only means that the rights therein\n      established or recognized do not depend upon further\n      legislative action in order to become operative. No case has\n      construed the term “self-executing” as allowing money\n      damages for constitutional violations. More importantly, in a\n      suit against the state, there cannot be a right to money\n      damages without a waiver of sovereign immunity and we\n      regard as unsound the argument that all substantive rights\n      of necessity create a waiver of sovereign immunity such that\n      money damages are available.\n\nId.

A closer examination of Sanders shows that we relied on\nEntick in striking down a statute that we determined operated as a general warrant in\nviolation of article I, section 8 of the Iowa Constitution. Id. at 239–243 (reasoning that\ngeneral warrants had been “entirely unknown” “since the decision of Lord Camden, in\n[Entick] v. Carrington”). In other words, Entick was cited for an entirely different point in\n1855 than the lead opinion cites it for today.\n\f                                     102\n\n      Here the lead opinion backs itself into a corner.           Godfrey’s\n\nconstitutional damage claims are still “claims” against State officials\n\nwithin the meaning of Iowa Code chapter 669.                See Iowa Code\n\n§ 669.2(3)(b) (defining “claim” as “[a]ny claim against an employee of the\n\nstate . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any\n\nemployee”). But punitive damages are expressly barred. Id. § 669.4.\n\n      While there’s no question that Iowans have long been able to\n\nrecover punitive damages in general, see Cochran v.

Shepherd Components, Inc. v. Brice Petrides-Donohue\n\n&   Assocs.,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2217960\"><a href=\"/opinion/2217960/shepherd-components-v-brice-petrides/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    619   (Iowa   1991)   (upholding    the\n\nconstitutionality of Iowa Code section 668A.1). The legislature can limit\n\npunitive damages even in a suit between two private parties. See id. If\n\npunitive damages are not a matter of right, how can the mere\n\nunavailability of such damages render a remedy constitutionally\n\ninadequate?\n\n      If the lead opinion were correct that there is a constitutional right\n\nto recover punitive damages from the State in appropriate cases, I am at\n\na loss to understand how that would work in the real world.              Let’s\n\nassume that a plaintiff could demonstrate that the defendant’s actions\n\n“constituted willful and wanton disregard,” Iowa Code § 668A.1(1)(a), but\n\nnot that the conduct was “directed specifically at the claimant, or at the\n\nperson from which the claimant’s claim is derived.” Id. § 668A.1(1)(b). In\n\nthat case, the trial court may direct up to twenty-five percent of the\n\npunitive damages to be awarded to the claimant, “with the remainder of\n\f                                   103\n\nthe award to be ordered paid into a civil reparations trust fund\n\nadministered by the state court administrator.”          Id. § 668A.1(2)(b)\n\n(emphasis added). So would most of the award cycle back to the State\n\n(although admittedly to a special fund)?     Or does section 668A.1 even\n\napply? As we have seen, the lead opinion’s constitutional bulldozer has\n\nalready pushed aside section 216.16(1)’s exclusivity language and section\n\n669.4’s bar on punitive damages.       Would it also get to knock down\n\nsection 668A.1?\n\n      Another question arises.    How is a jury supposed to assess the\n\n“financial worth” of the State in setting the punitive damage award? See\n\nMcClure v. Walgreen Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2221540\"><a href=\"/opinion/2221540/mcclure-v-walgreen-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233 (Iowa 2000). Will we have\n\njurors examining the State budget?\n\n      And there is no logical reason to draw the line at punitive damages.\n\nThe lead opinion amounts to a judicial declaration of defiance. The lead\n\nopinion signals that it will not be constrained by anything the legislature\n\ndoes and can devise any and all damage remedies it deems suitable and\n\nproper for alleged constitutional violations. This principle seems to lack\n\nany boundary.      Can the court provide for a ten-year statute of\n\nlimitations? Can the court eliminate any and all forms of immunity?\n\n      At this point, a majority of this court has not decided that punitive\n\ndamages may be awarded against the State on a constitutional claim. As\n\nI have tried to show, the availability of punitive damages would be a\n\nreason not to allow direct constitutional claims against the State.\n\n     VI. The Impact of Today’s Decision on this Case May be\nLimited, but It Will Have Wide-Reaching Effects Throughout State\nand Local Government.\n\n      Today’s decision may not end up altering the result in this case.\n\nThe amici urge us to dispose of the due process claims on independent\n\f                                    104\n\ngrounds. They argue that a high-level state policymaking official such as\n\na workers’ compensation commissioner has no due process right to a\n\nparticular salary, no due process right to be free from criticism for “poor\n\nwork performance,” and no due process right to be insulated from\n\n“partisan” political action.   These arguments weren’t advanced by the\n\ndefendants, so they are not addressed by the majority. Still, they remain\n\nopen issues in this case.\n      Additionally, the plaintiff’s counsel conceded at oral argument that\nif the defendants reduced the plaintiff’s salary not because of his sexual\norientation or his political affiliation, but simply because they disagreed\nwith his policies as workers’ compensation commissioner, there would be\nno constitutional claim.\n      While the impact of today’s decision in this case may be limited,\nthere should be no doubt about its far-reaching effects elsewhere.           I\nanticipate many claims from current and former inmates seeking\ndamages for wrongful incarceration. True, if you read the Iowa Code, the\nState has not waived sovereign immunity as to such claims except in the\nlimited circumstances presented by chapter 663A.            See Iowa Code\n§§ 663A.1, 669.14(4). But now an inmate can bring a direct claim for\ndamages under article I, section 10 (ineffective assistance of counsel),\narticle I, section 9 (due process of law), or article I, section 17 (cruel and\nunusual punishment).\n      Sanford would now be decided differently; yet it is just one\nexample.   To give another illustration, in light of this court’s juvenile\nsentencing decisions, I would expect individuals who have been\nresentenced because their earlier sentences violated article I, section 17\nto seek damages for the constitutional violation.\n      For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district court.\n      Waterman and Zager, JJ., join this dissent.\n\f</pre>",
